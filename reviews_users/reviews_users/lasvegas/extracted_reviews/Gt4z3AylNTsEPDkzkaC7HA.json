I love the red velvets at Babystacks, but the ones at Stacks and Yolks blew those away. I also tried the chicken breast and waffle. The chicken was amazing, but the waffle was nothing special. Together, it was really good though. I'd recommend this place, but try to avoid the prime breakfast times because the wait is long.",

Our two young kids were restless and hungry while we waited almost 45 minutes for food, that then came out with some mistakes. Food was just ok. No need to go back.",

In our most recent experience we walked up and were offered to wait or to be seated on the patio. We chose the patio as it was not very warm yet. Once seated we waited no less than 35 min to have our order taken or water brought to our table. Once our orders were taken it took at least 20 min to get our food. Then waited another 5 to get silverware. No drink refills on the water we had were ever offered. We finished our breakfast. Paid the check and left. Not planning on visiting this location again.",

We watched other tables be cleared and sit unoccupied for a while, then were seated.   Initially, I was fine with this.  It's a Saturday and it's breakfast time.  But as we sat down (just the two of us) a few things started to bother me.   As we were putting our order in, another table of two was seated.  They got their food 10 minutes before we did.  Our food took about 40 minutes to be brought out (for an omelette and a waffle).  We were on the verge of walking out the door.  Because right before we got our food, a table of four that arrived after us got theirs.  I waited 40 minutes for a lukewarm omelet with cold home fries.  My husband had a churro waffle and said it was \"alright\".   Pretty disappointed.  There were good things.  The OJ was fresh, the server was friendly.  However, that server and at least one other, both who had long hair, were wearing their hair down.  Not even pulled back.  Definitely rubbed me the wrong way.",

They have a really cool pancake menu on their wall and also have specials of the day!   My friend and I went with the build your own omelette with toast and a short stack of \"Always November.\" We shared because we felt like we wouldn't be able to finish it and was I right! What a great place to share because their portions are huge!  The omelette was made of egg whites and we pretty much topped it with everything...onions, mushrooms, peppers, tomatoes, sausage, ham, and bacon. It was huuuuge and really yummy! Hot and fresh. It also came with home fries (potatoes), and toast. We grabbed the sourdough toast. They were okay, not the best I've had but they were good nonetheless. The pancakes were surprisingly as big as the plate! A short stack came with two and it was a little pricey but we didn't mind. It was pancake batter with whipped cream and cream cheese sauce. Our server suggested adding chocolate chips. It was delicious!! But after a while the pancake had a weird texture to it so I stopped eating it halfway. It was getting a little soggy too from all the stuff they put on top of it. Tip: eat the pancakes first and right away (hard for someone like me who eats super slow)!  Our server was a very social guy named Eddy. He was awesome and definitely helped us out. I'm glad I was able to try this place out. It's pretty good but I would still choose another place to have breakfast but that's just me.",

However, they were out of lemons for my ice tea and the silverware was dirty. I asked for a coffee and when I got to the bottom the cup had old food stuck in it. Our food took average time to show up and we asked for a third setting of silver for my fiance but never received it. Our friend ordered the pancakes with bananas and it came with no bananas. We asked the server for them and she said she put in there order. And again they never showed up even thought we where charged for them. The restaurant started to fill up and we noticed our server was the server for all 20 tables including the patio. We all work in the restaurant industry and I don't care how good you are it is impossible to take care of that many guests. The server looked frantic and overwhelmed. She did have two bussers helping her but that was all. I am giving three stars even though it should only be one. The staff tried their best and where still very friendly even though they where in the weeds. My suggestion is to properly staff for breakfast/lunch on a Saturday at noon. Unfortunately we won't be back but I hope this review helps management improve things for future guests.",

We were quite close to the ordering station where there was a lot of foot traffic, but that really didn't bother us, but it could for those who are \"claustrophobic\". Just saying.  For my first time I wanted pancakes. BTW... If you're a light eater 1 stack is seriously just enough just add ur eggs n bacon. Build your own: 1 stack (3.99) ur choice of batter, I chose Buttermilk for simplicity. Added toppings ur choice, I chose Blueberries for antioxidants and anti aging ;) (1.00) I upgraded my order with 2 eggs and 2 bacon (2.99)  All worth it! I'd like to continue coming here and try something different with every visit.  They have so much more to choose from for breakfast and lunch.  Check out their menu. Forget IHOP, this is now my go to house of pancakes.  YUM!",

I ordered the Lips stack with eggs and sausage and it took forever to get our food, probably around 25-30min. And when it came the food was sub-par. The red velvet stack (\"the Lips\") was like eating a rubber disc. When I went to cut it it pulled back and was \"tough\" to eat, literally. The eggs and sausage were fine so maybe this place is better suited for its skillets and omelette's. Also, the bus boy came by and asked how the food was and I mentioned the pancakes weren't that good and he said, \"they're like rubber huh?\" WTF?? The food isn't free for me to sit and listen to you talk it down. Also, they were quick to pick up their tip for the worst red velvets this side of Clark County, lol. When you hold a pancake on a fork in the air it should fall off to the plate, not this pancake. This thing stuck on the fork like a cheap TUFF steak.",

From the typical eggs and bacon to mexican eggs, this place has it all! Let's not forget their cranberry orange pancakes, or any of the other amazing and unique combinations they have on the menu. Visit this place for breakfast and you will fall in love with it just like I did!",

I had no expectations for The Griddle BUT figured it was probably alright since its been open for years (not many businesses can say that yeah?)  The daily special during my visit was the corn beef hash (made from REAL brisket) and was delicious! It was served with biscuits and gravy (meh), eggs, and maybe something else. HOWEVER it was $14, holysht, probably would not order again unless my wallet was overflowing with money. That is a lot of money for an off strip, eggs and hash brown joint.   French Toast and the Red Velvet pancake was also ordered. The prices for each at $2.99 was a bit of a steal considering its large proportions, could easily get satisfied with one pancake. The Red Velvet pancake was sub par though, it felt more like a small cake rather than a huge pancake with chocolate syrup.   Skip the coffee, unless you enjoy black water.   Overall it cost $40 for 2 entrees, 1 pancake, 1 french toast, and a coffee. A bit steep, but mostly contributed from the corn beef hash. Service was friendly, the waiter was nice and communicated well. I would probably come back since my cousin loves this place, but definitely to try different items.",

Friend ordered the country skillet with a side of French toast. I tried the French toast and it was to die for. It was difficult to just eat a bite and let my friend eat the rest. My omelette was really good, it came with a side of home fries and toast--the whole meal was so big that I was able to take home half the omelette and half the toast.

The environment is like an old friends house and you can sit for hours talking and laughing with your friends. Their menu is big and offers a pretty wide variety on what you can order and they specialize in unique pancakes and skillets. I don't think you can go wrong on anything you order as I only see smiling faces chowing down at this restaurant. The portions are also pretty big so you leave feeling fat and happy! You need to get here at an early hour though as this place does fill up fast on the weekends. They also have two locations. I prefer the one on Durango as closer to where I live but there is another one in the northwest part of town.  I am pretty standard on what I order which is usually bacon, eggs, sourdough toast and an OJ or hot chocolate depending on what time of year it is. On this occasion I was doing with one of my besties. She ordered the traditional Eggs Benedict and we shared a delicious pancake. The pancake was fluffy and not heavy like pancakes can be at times. She really enjoyed her Eggs Benedict and told me the cream sauce was very rich yet spot on!   Stacks and Yolks, you are the sunshine of my Saturday mornings! Thanks!",

Super nice people that work there, but I think the wait help was shorthanded that the customer service part suffered. Yup, it happens to the best of them.  We got to the restaurant at about 1 pm so the Saturday brunch was busy. Those that chose to sit outside that came after us, didn't have their orders taken until after my husband and I were seated in the restaurant, which was a good 10-minute wait for them.  My husband and I waited just as long for our orders to be taken as well.   My husband ordered the corn beef skillet special while I ordered the stack patty melt. Unfortunately, our main dishes came out but the sides that came with the orders, didn't come until another 10-minutes later. My stack patty melt was missing the eggs. So they gave me the eggs separately. I wasn't sure if the egg was supposed to go in the sandwich or on top, so I did one of each.  The hamburger had no taste.  Because of the wait time to put in our order, we rushed it and forgot to order a short stack. So we waited another couple of minutes because I needed my sweets. We ended up taking to go but my husband and I wanted a little taste. When we took it out of the bag, there was no syrup! UGH! The restaurant was starting to clear out by that time so the syrup was delivered rather quickly. Pancakes, fluffy good.  I understand, it was the 4th of July weekend, so I'm sure plenty of employees were out that day. So I am more than happy to change my rating with a better experience the next time. But this next time is going to be a long while from now. Just too many places to check out, ya know?",

Everyone was super nice but they just dropped the food off and left us to our own devices. I ordered chicken and waffles and it was cold (the butter didn't even melt) when I asked for them to warm it they were great about it But I didn't get my food back until everyone in my party was finished and my food was still cold. Never got my coffee refilled. They were kind enough to comp me for the plate. Then it took forever to get the check and then they gave me someone else's card and still had to wait for my check. I got it but then I had to walk it up to them so I would cut the wait time. Still had to wait for them to bring back my card. Basically, the food was mediocre. The service was bad.  My rating scale: 2 stars for good food + 2 stars for good service + 1 star for nice people.  My score: I give one star for nice ppl.",

I think they do a great job at working together to take care of the customers. The place looks really nice and the menu is large enough to cover any desire you might have.   Cons - The food!!!! I ordered the chicken (chicken breast) and waffles. The chicken was sooooo dry. If you order this, get the chicken wings and waffles. Now onto the pancakes. I really didn't like them at all. While they are huge, they are not good at all. The eggs were pretty hard and just plain.   Conclusion - If you go to Stacks and Yolks, don't order Stacks or Yolks.",

    "text": "This was our first time here and we decided to try it on a Thursday morning. Hubby was greeted rather rudely by a gentleman when he walked in the door, telling him to go outside and someone will come and take our name. There was a podium outside and no one was at it so that was why he walked in. After a couple of minutes a young lady came and took our name and said it would be about 15/20minutes. No problem as they serve breakfast all Day and it was almost noontime. It was busy but looked to be ok. Once we were seated inside, guess who our server was? \"Rude\" Guy. Lucky us, the young lady brought us coffee and water and I asked her for utensils, she brought us forks and knives,no napkins or spoons. Asked another server for napkins and spoons. Now there were a few empty tables at this time. Lots of choices so I had a few questions. Seemed that our server was annoyed with something as I told him it was our first time and I had a few questions. He half heartily apologized saying they were short handed so just didn't even really answer my questions but told me that pancakes are large and the most popular are on the wall and that he would come back to take our order. Before even taking our food order, we already had three cups of coffee. Next had a little clipboard with a bill and a credit card attached dropped off for us and same \"rude\" guy said without even looking at us, \"have a nice day\". REALLY! Stopped another young man and gave him the bill and credit card and told him in a joking manner, that we would like to have our meal before getting a bill for it. He laughed and apologized. Meal finally came and it was ok. Large portions for sure and price was reasonable for the quality and quantity. First point of contact sets the tone for the experience. After driving clear across town to eat here, I would be hard pressed to recommend. I can get the same thing closer to home minus the \"Rude\" guy.",

We got up and then some RUDE server (African american man with a beard) LIES to my face and says there is no manager, after the host JUST told me there was. I will spare u the rest of our useless convo and sum it up with he was a complete jerk! He didn't care at all that we had been waiting for 20 minutes and the TWO tables he just greeted were sat 10 minutes after us. His excuse \" i didnt know the order of people sat\". Well then coming from someone who knows F&B get your stuff together and communicate with your host staff who's seating so your service doesn't completely suck! He just had excuse after excuse and not one apology. FYI server guy dont be an absolute jerk when your PAYING, repeat patrons are upset that you basically just shafted them and just said you dont matter to their face!!  I had read reviews that the service has gone down a lot and the staff is rude but being a repeat customer for years I didnt really believe them. Sidenote i had a few unpleasant experiences here my last couple visits, but i always chalked it up to \"its just once and no big deal\" but after today i realize its just the way it is now.  Forget stacks and yolks...Go to baby stacks!!!",

My table was unfortunately positioned where anyone coming in or out from my side of the restaurant had to squeeze past, knocking around anything sitting on my table. This did not seem to be a problem at other tables, though, so it's probably bad luck on my part.  Service was horrendous. I waited another 15 minutes to order, requested a coffee refill 3 times before someone brought coffee, and it took about 20 minutes to get my overcooked meal. The person who took my payment was gone for a long time, and when the table beside mine asked what happened to THEIR payment, they gave my card to them.  Food was edible but overcooked and a little bland. I won't come back.",

Call me crazy, but I always thought waffles were served in their solid state?  Try #2, eggs over medium.  They came to me not even over easy (still had all the clear goo all over them).  I ate them because I didn't want to get berated for not ordering correctly again.  Arrived at 7:30 this morning for try #3 (we've given them a year to figure things out since our last visit) and we had to wait for silverware because they were \"waiting for clean silverware to come out.\" At 7:30am?? Maybe they only have 6 forks or something?  If you have to go here, stick with their pancakes, and maybe bring some silverware from home just in case. :-)",

The potatoes were tasty, not the best texture because they were not crisp on the outside, plus they are much larger cuts of potatoes. The service was kind of odd. I did not have one server but maybe 6? One took our order. Someone else brought our food. Someone asked us if everything is okay. Three others came by too. I felt rushed the whole time. The check was dropped off a couple minutes after the food. Plus the servers kept asking if we were done with our plate, mid-bite! O.O Can't you tell that I am still eating?

We usually grab something from a place about to close but on this day I was up before noon. So we ventured to a new and exciting place down the street from my place. Stacks and Yolks is in the northeast corner of Warm Springs and Durango. They have a hostess stand outside and you have to wait to be seated and I understand why. It's so cramped inside. The table we sat at was right by the register so everyone was walking by and standing near us. They servers even had to sneak behind each other. We sat and looked through the menu and I was all about the pancakes. I order a single stack of red velvet and a single of lemon blueberry. I thought, \"Oh, a single stack is small.\" Just kidding. They are the size of the plate. I only ate half of both. They were both delicious but i preferred the lemon blueberry. The red velvet has some sauces on it that weren't the bomb. Otherwise they come with a huge scoop of better and they didn't need much syrup. Overall a good first experience. I want to go back and try some of the Yolks.",

There were only two waiters (female and male) and they were hustling around and really provided awesome service despite the busyness ! Food came out in a decent time and it was delicious! I ordered the meat lovers scramble and it was awesome! Everything about it was perfect and the biscuits and gravy were fantastic! We also got the pumpkin pancakes and YUMMMMMYYY!!! Totally coming back, mainly for the awesome service ! Was really impressed with how short staffed they were.",

    "text": "First time here as we have been wanting to try it out because it's right by our house. The waitress said the special of the day was loco moco and that it was very good, hamburger patty over white sticky rice and few eggs on top. Being a regular white sticky rice eater this sounded pretty good to me.  When the food runner brought my order it was a carne asada skillet and I said that wasn't what I ordered, he said \"YOU must have been confused because this is the special.\" I explained to him that, no I wasn't confused and he needs to check with the one who took the order. They took it back and started on my order. By the time she brought my order, my family was finished  eating.   Was pretty hungry at this point and just glad to get the food. That excitement quickly ended when I took my first bite. Scrambled egg on top was ok, it's hard to mess that up, hamburger patty was decent but gravy was bland. However the rice, which to me is the main part of this dish because everything is on top of it, was just bad. Sticky rice doesn't mean it should be like mash potatoes, too much water and no taste. My daily white rice eaters would agree. After a few bites I couldn't even eat it. Just wanted the check so we could get leave.   When I got the check, I see that this hamburger patty/egg over white rice was more than anything on their menu, even more than the steak. How is that? And this is the special? Now I knew why the waitress was so eager to say it was so good.   I would have gave it one star but my son liked his happy face pancake.   I still tipped because I'm in the hospitality business but very disappointed in service and taste.  After all, you only get one chance to make a first impression. It's too bad because it's by the house and we really wanted to like it.",

My waitress was lovely and helped me from over ordering by really knowing the menu, which is a nice change. The bussers were always there to ask if I needed more water.

He never greeted us, just went to our table and ask us what we want to eat. No hi no hello. Since it's such a small place and was crowded, there is really no place to move around. While he was cleaning the other table, his big fat ass is on my face!!! Added to that, his phone on his back pocket is ringing loudly!!! Never once he came back to our table ask us what else we need!!! I'll come back this place again, one last chance the Sunday after next.

But it was the food that had me itching to come back. Then I did and my second visit was just disappointing. It was so bad I haven't gone back, though I think I might one day.  My first trip I got the philly cheese steak skillet and I subbed the mushrooms for fresh jalapenos. It was wonderful: perfectly cooked eggs, tender beef, fluffy potatoes, flavorful melted cheese, all kept screaming hot by the skillet throughout my meal.  It was one of the first meals I've had in awhile that compelled me to come back to the same restaurant in a week.    The second time I came in nothing was the same. Our server wasn't as nice, the atmosphere was louder and uncomfortable. Worst of all, the food was awful. I ordered the same breakfast, cooked the same way and received something completely different. My eggs weren't cooked right, the jalapenos were barely cooked at all, and the there was considerably less beef on the plate.  Yes plate! They served my skillet breakfast on a regular plate this time, which killed the presentation, didn't keep the food warm (much less hot), and altogether defeated the purpose of ordering a skillet. Such a big let down.  Like I said, I'll probably go back one day since it's so close to my house, I'm just not ready to yet.  It's worth checking out if you're looking for a nearby breakfast place that's decent, just don't expect consistency.",

    "text": "Gave us drinks without straws. Had to ask twice and then they still shorted us by one. Had to ask a third time. Dirty silverware. Bathroom is a mess with black sticky floors and paper towels everywhere. Women's rest room had a broken lock and no paper towels. Arnold Palmer had virtually no lemonade. My daughter pinched all of her fingers in her chair trying to scoot back. The chair is falling apart and unsafe. The table is being balanced by two different magazines in two different spots. Now the food: it was all pretty good. A couple half-pound chunks of potato were still raw but it was good. I ordered a ham skillet and got a treat with a piece of random sausage. The hot sauce needs some attention though. The wood cap on the Chalula bottle was split and actually came off. The label was written and faded as though it were five years old. Yet the bottle was full of hot sauce. Isn't it illegal to refill manufacturer's condiment bottles?",

    "text": "I've tried this place twice. And there will be no more attempts.  The first time the boyfriend and i came in around 9:00AM on a Tuesday. Wasn't  busy, and were sat right away. Waiter seemed pleasant, order was taken abruptly. We only had water to drink. He ordered a meat omelet,  and i (being vegetarian and not a huge fan of breakfast food) ordered a veggie burger. After waiting about 10 minutes, the waiter comes over to inform me that they were out of veggie burgers. However,  from where i was sitting i could see the cook, and because it was slow,  saw him physically leaning over the counter as if he were tired or just plain lazy; i had a sneaking suspicion that he just didn't want to go to the \"effort\" of preparing the veggie burger.  Ended up ordering a vegetable omelet. Food was decent,  nothing special,  but still edible.   Second time: came by myself on a weekday (mainly because it's right across the street) waitress took about 10 minutes to come over.  Restaurant was full,  but not on a wait.  Waitress was very disinterested and cold. (However she seemed to really warm up when she was tending to her male tables)   I ordered water and the veggie burger AGAIN. At least 15 minutes went by and she came by to inform me they are out of veggie burgers. AGAIN. She asks me if i want something else, but doesn't bring me a menu. I guess she assumes i know the ENTIRE menu by heart. I ask for a menu,  which she returns with 5 minutes later. They don't have a huge vegetarian selection,  so i was ready to order relatively quickly. I waited about 10 minutes for her to come back but she never did.  I finally asked  another server to get her for me. Another 5 or so minutes go by,  and she returns.  I order a veggie omelet,  adding feta cheese.  A good 20 minutes goes by.  No food.  Empty water glass. 15 more minutes go by.  No food. No water. Waitress comes over with the check and says flatly, \"I'll take it when you're ready\". She must have noticed my pissed off and confused look and asked if i needed something. I said \"yes. A refill and my food\". She looked confused; which i don't understand, seeing as how a perfectly clean, folded napkin and clean silverware were sitting on the table. She doesn't say a word,  just walks away. 10 more minutes go by,  and as I'm about to walk out,  the food comes. Without feta. I ask about the cheese,  and annoyed,  she leaves to bring me a very small side of cold,  feta cheese. Food was the same mediocre omelet i had the first time,  with less than an ounce of cheese. Fortunately, i had worked the night before so i had cash on me; I didn't want to wait another 15 minutes for her to run my debit card and scowl at me. NEVER. AGAIN.",

I think what keeps me coming back is the master chief EDDIE. I know when I arrive and he is cooking? I will always have a delicious plate of whatever he serves me. I have tried everything on the menu, one of my favorites is the  \"Griddle platter\". But I also enjoy the \"November pancakes\", you have to get them with cheesecake topping instead of butter. You won't even need syrup. The service is always great but sometimes when they are busy you will have to wait five to ten minutes to sit or get your meal, but it is still fast for how busy they are. I am here on a Friday, my wait time was five minutes when they said it could have been fifth-teen, I normally grab my own silverware because I feel I am always right at home when I come. But they are pretty quick to set up your table. If you have never been here make sure Eddie is cooking, because you won't be displeased. #TeamStacks&Yolks #TeamEddie",

The restaurant is always busy, but they don't have the staff to accomodate. The food is slow to come out, the waiters are running around telling guests that they are busy, and the check takes forever even if you go up to the registered.  Second, the quality of the food has gone down tremendously. Their recipe was perfection but the cooks have ruin them. My food was cold, my eggs were not cooked how I want them, and their food doesn't taste great anymore.  Third, this is more of a personal issue, but I found a large piece of glove.....in my food! IT WAS GROSS! When I brought it up to the staff, they were annoyed at me. I'M SORRY YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR CUSTOMER'S HEALTH. In addition, they charged me for the food and did not bring me a new plate of food. So I had to ask the waiter to take my meal off the bill. They were giving me nothing, but attitude. I will take my money somewhere else then.",

For a Wednesday brunch time, it was still pretty full and I was lucky to get a table.  Having a table near the open kitchen area, I was eyeing up all of the delicious food being prepared.  Our waitress was fairly attentive throughout our meal.  My coffee cup never went empty which is always a bonus in my book.  My friend and I decided to split the Crab Cake Benedict breakfast as well as the Always November Stack.  The crab cakes had a light breading topped with perfectly poached eggs.  The yolk just oozed onto the plate satisfying to the eyes.  The taste did not disappoint with a savory and fulfilling flavor. It wasn't overly sauced with hollandaise so you could enjoy the flavors that create this benedict.    On to the sweet stuff: Ordering the 'Always November' stack will prepare you for fall with the pumpkin batter pancakes stopped with whip, cinnamon and drizzled with a cream cheese frosting.  The pancake size are a larger size which made me happy we only went with the short stack (2).    Our breakfast was filling and delightful.  Since breakfast is the most important meal of the day you might as well stop into Stacks & Yolks for a happy morning!",

While I didn't detect any peanut butter flavor in the pancakes themselves (I suspect just normal batter was used and the peanut butter request forgotten), the pancakes were still quite good. Also shared a patty melt (hey I was hungry) and that was also good. However, I requested swiss cheese and the server was supposed to check if they had it and didn't return until the food came and they used cheddar. Oh well. That brings me to the service. The service was so-so. We had to wait a while to order and then wait a while for refills. Service was kind, but not attentive. That's what brought the rating down. Still, if I'm in the area, I'd try this place again.",

We were directed to a choice of two tables near two other tables with people seated.  People were also seated at the back of the diner.    If this had been our first visit it would have been our last.  The server could have nipped this with a simple \"we close at 3 but you're welcome to have a seat\" message.  We expected lunch.  My wrap was missing 2 main ingredients, my fellow diner's meals were lukewarm/less than the usual fare.  The message I hope S&Y understands is if you are going to seat someone provide the same quality of service and food.  I would have gone elsewhere & still have S&Y as a future dining option.  Not so much now.",

    "text": "Came here for breakfast/brunch on Saturday after attending an Autism walk in Town Square. Located just south of 215/Durango, it is in the same plaza as Firehouse Subs, Volcano Grille, etc. Parking was a mild pain but we all got lucky and got enough spots for all our cars upon arrival. Lol   Apparently, they are \"CASH ONLY\" According to my friends who's been here before, its been cash only for quite a while, and have yet to fix their system. My theory is, they trying to drag it as long as possible and take cash like some asian places LOL ....   Also according to friends, the menu has been updated and changed a bit. Prices compared to menu's posted on yelp from late last year seemed to have up'ed a dollar, on average.   To be honest, i'm not much of a breakfast person, but to have once in a while, im not against. And when there's a good one (like another place i had recently with a friend), i dont mind having again. mmm Lol unfortunately not this place Lol...   After long consideration, decided to go for a simple breakfast.   Corned Beef Hash w/ over easy eggs, hash browns, and a biscuit. Flat top grilled/cooked corned beef hash created a nice amount of crispy bits. Eggs were mildly under 'over easy' as some of the white hasn't set yet. Hash browns, were hash browns. XD Biscuit was good but quite small. Amount of food in my order seemed less than what you would get from a skillet, but then again, i may have been overly hungry. XD   My friend had ordered canadian bacon, as she was craving it for some odd reason. It was quite thickly cut. Because it was so thick, it reminded us of ham. XD   Two other friends had ordered philly skillet and carne asada skillet. Both piled quite high and looked pretty decent actually. Lol   Luckily i didn't get the toast. It looked kind of sad and hard. awkwardly sized too. Didn't seem like a normal sized slice of bread   I didn't see the mentioned poor service or dirtiness some other people have mentioned. We were served fairly well in a consistent fashion. Seated promptly. Yeah they didn't refill my water without asking but eh. We had a mess up with our \"bread\" orders and my friend had ate my biscuit thinking it was his english muffin. We recalled the waitress calling it an english biscuit when she brought the food. My mind/ears turned off when she said 'english' and i ignored it. Later realized it was my biscuit when his english muffin came later. She brought another biscuit, even after my friend said to put the new biscuit on his bill, but we weren't charged for it. When the waitress first brought our food, she asked us what hot sauce we wanted. I asked for Tobasco. Later my friend has for Cholula. Some how a 2nd bottle of Tobasco showed up too. Haha !   Maybe ordered the wrong things but this is like a normal breakfast place. Nothing that stands out, but nothing bad. A-ok XD",

They were also out of cottage cheese and olives which was odd since we came early in the day. You will be better off with a cheap Vegas buffet and will get the same ingredients.   Avoid.",

    "text": "Good pancakes, awful service.  Arrived just after 11am on a weekday morning. It is obvious that service staff are not trained well - there were maybe 12 tables seated tops, but despite 3 waitstaff, we'd honestly have been better off if it'd been a counter service place! We were seated not too long after entering, but it took nearly 15 mins before anyone even brought us a menu (this is my pet peeve - I would have left had I been by myself), another 10+ minutes before anyone bothered taking our order, and another 25 minutes before our food even arrived. Nearly one hour after being seated to get our food at a place like this? Yikes. Servers never proactively filled our drinks either - we had to ask every time. And when we mentioned the long waits when paying our bill, the lady at the register just shrugged.  It's a shame as I liked my \"November\" pancakes - great flavor on these pumpkin pancakes with a nice, slightly moist texture - really good with syrup and the cream cheese topping. The rest of my party seemed to like their food as well. Too bad the service ensures I'll never be back.",

The seating situation was kind of uncomfortable, scrunched together. After we sat, we knew what we wanted so ordered fairly quickly. The menu is a good, and easy - breakfast on the front, lunch on the back. After we ordered, felt like we were pretty much forgot about. It took 45 mins to get our food, and no refills on our water. So I would have to say service was lacking.  When the food came, it was alright - I ordered the minty pancakes and they were kind of dry. The scrambled eggs lacked any salt, but bacon was good ( who can mess up on bacon haha ). I have to say I'm not a fan of this breakfast joint, I probably won't be back anytime soon. :)",

They looked so pretty when they came out to the table. They are funfetti pancakes with whipped cream, strawberries and sprinkles on top. They tasted amazing! I then got a side of eggs and sausage. I should have only gotten the sausage because I was too full to finish the eggs. They also have your traditional breakfasts that isn't all dessert if pancakes aren't your thing. We came early on a Friday so it wasn't too crowded and service was good. Great place to try if you're looking for a yummy breakfast place.",

This is homemade hash made with red peppers and onions. It came with (3) eggs, potatoes, and a biscuit with gravy for $15.00. The biscuit was moist and the gravy was exceptional. I loved the hash - one of the best I've ever tried. The eggs were made exactly as ordered.   The coffee was also good, but I wish they served flavored non-dairy creamers.

However, on Monday we went to have breakfast and I was disgusted with the lack of cleanliness of this place.  We sat at a booth and I was able to look around and see just how dirty it was!!  First of all as we walked to the booth I could see just how dirty the seats and backs were.  It looked as though no one had cleaned them in a very long time.  After sitting down I looked out the windows and all I saw was dirt, grime and food that had splattered on them, inside and out!!!  Come on how much time would it take to clean windows!!  The floors were very dirty as well, the grout was black and there was food and dirt all over that floor!  No way they clean the floors regularly.  I could only imagine how dirty the tables and chairs must be.  I just don't understand how you can run a restaurant and not keep it clean.  With that said the service was ok, just a little slow for a non busy day.  I wasn't really comfortable eating my breakfast after I saw the condition of the restaurant.  We will not be back!!  I will look for another place to have breakfast where I don't have to worry about the cleanliness.  I didn't use the restroom but after seeing the obvious I can only imagine the restroom would be worse!!  Beware.",

I went to use the bathroom and there was so toilet paper, no seat protectors, and no hand washing soap. In addition, the floor was filthy and there was dried poop still on the sleep. I notified a staff member, he brings some new toilet paper and walks away and does something else. Any restaurant that has standards this low for the bathroom, I can only imagine what the kitchen looks like, which is not a suprise I guess because after researching this I seen they've been on dirty dining. I wanted to leave, but my girl insisted we stay so we did and of course our food cane put under cooked . We sent her meal back, paid and walked out. What's sad is this place has been really good and has a phenomenal menu, especially the Churro fried toast. The owner needs to check who he has running the joint, it's really sad to see the place go down hill so fast. Hopefully they can get it together. Im not trying to bash the place I just hope ownership sees this and realizes they have a problem",

    "text": "Been here 4 times. Service was better some days than others. Great our first time. Sub par second time and HORRIFIC the last two. Two people sat down ready to order after our drinks and sat for ten min meanwhile a group of 4 who came in after us ordered before us.  I think they're overpriced... who charges $1 for each topping on a pancake. I mean $1 for five slivers of a banana that probably cost them 10 cents....  anyway- food is basic. It looks great but that's really it. Looks far better than it tastes. The ingredients are bland. The eggs SUCK. If you ask for food well done it never comes well done. So- the reason I will NEVER AGAIN return: ordered a pancake (as usual) with two toppings. Came out looking great except their was a pound of cinnamon on top. It was completely undercooked that I almost threw up after biting/drinking my first piece of slop. Sent it back. Second one came out A THIRD OF THE SIZE OF THEIR NORMAL PANCAKE. Literally looked like a McDonald's pancake that somebody sat on. Never mind the size, IT WAS EVEN MORE UNDERCOOKED THAN THE FIRST ONE!!!! COMPLETE MOOSH! I've had their pancakes before- every time I've gone as a matter of fact. They also say if you post them on Instagram you get a free pancake- I did twice and never received a thing. I ordered the pancake and made it a combo (side of eggs and sausage) the owner removed the pancake AND STILL CHARGED FOR THE DRY FLAVORLESS EGGS AND COLD SAUSAGE!!!!! I'm still shocked 6 hours later. I'll never return. Pancake variety is great if it's actually cooked for you but it's expensive and flavorless food otherwise.",

I crave it everyday because it's sooo good. Their chicken and waffles is also so yummy! When i go i ALWAYS have to order both because i can never choose which one i want. The owners are such kind hearted people. Sometimes service there is a little slow which is why i give them four stars but other than that, it's Jennie Approved!",

    "text": "11:30 we walked in & greeted by the bus person. We ordered our food at 11:40 am.  I ordered coffee & asked the waiter for French Vanilla creamer. After waiting 10 minutes, I figured it slipped his mind.  So no biggie I asked the bus lady politely for creamer.  Our waiter over heard me asking her,  apologized & poured the cup of creamer.   Now I'm starting to notice the people across from us had just gotten their food 35 minutes after we ordered. 12:15pm we asked the bus lady to check on our food she tells us the cook was by himself today.  Oh GREAT!  12:20 rolls around and they served my bf's french toast cold & set his side order in front of me.  So I didn't get my food at all. Lovely.  My bf walks up to tell them his food is cold & the waiter told us, \"it JUST came out\".  The food & plate were cold. So cold the butter didn't even melt! Ha, insulting our intelligence is strike 2. Then he says,  since we had not ate anything we could leave. My response was \"GOOD!\"   Then come to find out they had a B grade by the health inspector & many demerits in the past.  They were featured on dirty dining (channel 13 news) before the name change.  Steer clear of this place to avoid food poisoning. I thought it was way overpriced for the portion sizes from what I could tell from my bf's order.  It's okay if it's pricey & the food is top notch but that was unacceptable service. They shooed us out the door for their mix ups. I thought we were more than patient with how long the wait was when it wasn't busy. Very disappointed. At least if you're going to have LONG wait times,  give out public wifi.   We're sitting down at The Cracked Egg on Sunset & Rainbow.  I waited 10 minutes & our food was up. They are reasonably priced for the huge portions. We've gotten coupons in the mail for our loyalty.",

The atmosphere was very busy and we enjoyed watching them cooking in the open area.  This place was recommended by our apartment manager and staff so we gave it a try.  It was wonderful.  I had the Eggs Benedict Crab cake.  I took 1/2 of it home and it tasted just as good reheated.  Everyone loved their food.  The hot chocolate was to die for, came with a huge mound of whipped cream with chocolate sauce and sprinkled with cinnamon.  The only negative was we were charged for extra mayonnaise for a sandwich.  That we didn't understand.  Other than that, it was $85 for 6 of us, which included our drinks, not bad.  This is a very busy place every day, and very crowded, so you may have to wait.  Only open until 3-pm. We will definitely return.",

They were very rubbery, chewy and couldn't cut through them with a fork. I wasn't a fan of the consistency at all. You shouldn't have to use a knife on pancakes.I tried others at the table to see if it was just my batter or not (cinnamon pancake batter). They were all of that consistency and chewiness. The pumpkin ones didn't really taste too much like pumpkin, very faint. My scramble had home fries on the bottom and the larger potatoes were hard :( When we were finished, no plates were cleared. We sat for 15 min talking and paying bill with old food in front of us. I've had much better food at Sunrise Cafe, Rise and Shine, or Babystacks. Not sure I'll be back..",

I had orange/cranberry IN the batter, and strawberries and bananas ON my waffle. It was really good but the cranberries were a bit overwhelming. It's about $3 more to add bacon and eggs if you're hungry enough for them. I stuck with the waffle and was completely satisfied. They had a breakfast special running with marinated steak that look and smelled wonderful. Maybe I'll venture away from my usual next time and give that a try. You can spend from $5 to $15 per person so if you're watching the budget (like I am toward the end of the month) you can still find a good breakfast.",

All I ever order is the three egg breakfast with extra crispy hash browns. One would think this a simple order but after being there for a entire hour I left without even eating. First she brought out my breakfast before my sister who was with me got her meal which was a soggy chicken melt that she didn't eat much of. Marisa apparently didn't hear me the three times I said extra crispy hash browns when I ordered and brought me home fries. About 30 minutes later she brought me back non crispy hash brown and what looked like dried out shrunken eggs. When she asked if that was ok I asked her for a percentage off the bill for such inconveniences because I wasn't going to wait again for her and the cook to get it right. She said she was alone so she didn't know what she could do. At that point I gave my plate back and told her to forget it. She took the plate with nothing else being said and walked away. When I asked her name she said \"they left me alone and I had to restock.\"  I almost forgot to mention that she forgot to bring me my tea and I had to ask her again for it. Total the whole time we where there she waited no more then four tables so no excuses to either Marisa or the cook. She needs a new profession quick because this regular is not coming back again. Sorry Mariah I'll miss you! You always toke such good care of me but it's only you who ever gets it right and I'm just totally over it.",

    "text": "After driving by Stacks & Yolks for years I decided to give the a go.  The staff was pleasantly serving guests & all the food looked & smelled delicious.  1st impression all good.   The restaurant was extremely busy, so waiting was not a problem and expected since it was NOON on a Sunday.  It took 10  minutes for a table, the table was cleaned up quickly however not thoroughly (still sticky in area's and when you serve pancakes you must be more careful to wipe with a clean hot towel), when the table was wiped all the crumbs fell on the chairs which were left there for us to shake off.  It took 20 minutes to put in our order, the food took over 40 minutes to prepare (It may have taken longer had I not asked about it after 30 minutes of waiting).  The staff were kind & helpful after getting their attention, so I excused the slow service to the volume knowing how you can get a major rush from time to time since I use to be in the restraint business for 13 years.  However the servers lacked the skills of acknowledgement & communication to us \"their customers\" which is especially crucial when you are busy & people are waiting a long time.   Leaving people wondering & hanging is the worst thing you can do!!    After 1 hour + the food was delivered.  The pancakes the kids ordered all looked great, my mom's food looked comsi comsa.  I ordered the Chef's special Corned beef hash (which is my favorite & it's one of the most expensive things on the menu and the menu, the description made it sound sensational.  Presentation was 1 out of 5 and when I tried to cut into the golf ball sized corned beef chunks I realized it was all fatty & grisly (not little cube pieces as normal), so I got the attention of manager came over and offered to exchange it for something else and he did.  I went with the chorizo egg special which was very tasty (yet only had traces of chorizo...3 or 4 very small penny size pieces).  The only reason I gave a 2 star instead of 1 was that the 2nd order received literally was prepared in 2 minutes (all breakfast cafe's should be able to provide quick table turnover because volume is everything).  Unfortunately this was the 1st & last time I will dine here.  If I am ever in the southwest part of town again.........Egg Works will be my choice since they provides a consistent quality & great service every time I have gone.  I am taking the time to write this, not to bash them (in fact this is amongst one of my only negative reviews & experiences dining out in years).  Hopefully help Stacks & Yolks will take this feedback to improve their service & food quality for all their future clientele & to keep their existing customers happy.",

    "text": "We found this place while driving around looking for someplace to have lunch. When we came in we liked the decor and menu options. We first ordered drinks, two waters and one coffee. I think our waitress forgot about the coffee because she told us twice she was coming back with the coffee before she actually brought it. For our meals, I ordered the cranberry orange pancake and made it a combo and added an extra egg. My fiance ordered the Country Combo and added a vanilla pancake. Our food tasted good but I found a hair in my eggs and my fiance found a hair in his pancake. Neither of us told the staff, we were almost done eating so didn't want to make a big deal out of it. Also, the vanilla pancake didn't taste like vanilla, just a regular pancake. We told our waitress about the pancake not tasting like vanilla so she took off the extra dollar charge. However, when we got our bill my fiance was charged $13.99 for his $6.99 meal and I was charged $2.99 for my extra egg that was supposed to cost $.99. Our waitress seemed a bit annoyed at us for mentioning anything but took the bill then another waiter brought it back fixed. They apologized but didn't seem too concerned about it. It's a shame the service is not good because we did like our food, except for the hairs. We won't be coming back after this experience.",

We got our food to-go but scarfed it down at an outside table before we met up with our group. We got the eggs benedict and a stack of hotcakes. The eggs benedict came with potatoes. Both were delicious and well-seasoned. It was creamy and not overly salty. The English muffin was nicely grilled. I loved the fact that they gave us lots of hollandaise sauce. One disappointment was the eggs were overpoached. Eggs benedict should be runny, but the yolk almost cooked all the way through. The hotcakes were hot, huge and fluffy. Service was great and helpful for our needs to be quick. Overall, pretty delicious breakfast food.",

Very disappointed for my first impression.  Food was pretty good decor and ambiance all the makings of an intimate passionate breakfast spot that I won't return to often because of the  unpassionate servers who expect a tip for standing around.  So Dissatisfied made the food pale to what could be better tasting and a great experience. Not impressed get new servers who actually care about working for a tip because they earned it not because it's expected. Tips stands for= To Insure Proper Service.  The morning staff on 11/20/14 .",

I wanted to try the pumpkin pancakes on the specials board, it noted what it came with whipped cream cheese, whipped cream, and cinnamon. Only I didn't want all that whipped nastiness on my pancakes so I asked for it on the side just so I can try A LITTLE bit, I know most places pack that shit on pancakes like crazy haha. I also ordered a side of eggs over easy and some breakfast potatoes, hoping they'd be seasoned. Food came out maybe 20 mins after that.... Whatever, it's a busy, mom + pops breakfast kind of place, don't really expect muuuuch organization haha. My potatoes were bland and I felt dumb for even ordering them haha. Pancakes were good, but no cinnamon.... Not even on the side! I just said whipped cream + cheese on side, I was hoping they'd sprinkle the cinnamon! So I asked my server for it and he brought it out as I'm finishing up my meal haha. Thanks dude. He was pretty slooooow! And the side whipped stuff was waaaay too much, I shouldn't have even wasted it because apparently it's a $1/ea. I was surprised that was on my bill, I thought it came WITH the pancakes that's why I asked for it on the side. That's kind of dumb that they jack you like that, making it seem like it comes with your pancakes. I didn't even finish them, I ordered two and only had half. Should've only ordered one!!! I was happy the manager or owner or whoever the cashier was at least took off the $2 of the whipped toppings because had I known, I obv wouldn't have wasted them. Servers should advise guests when they order those upsells, especially on the side because they're prob doing it to be a liiiittle health conscious haha. Indulging in pancakes is enough of a treat.... All that junk isn't all that necessary! Good stuff, just obv don't expect much service or attention.... Like any other breakfast joint",

I walk in the restaurant after a LONG night of drinking. Hungover and looked like a HOT mess! Lol. Anyhow....was greeted by the owner with a funny hand shake and was quickly sat. It was obvious that I was hungover and tired, so coffee was quickly brought by one of the waitresses. I browsed over the menu and was going to order the biscuits and gravy. But as I was waiting for my friends to decide the owner comes by and tells us that there are specials that are off the menu.  He tells us about all the different pancakes that he's come up with....like cranberry orange, chocolate chip, red velvet....ect. There was also a marinated beef tip special that he had as well. He made everything sound SO delicious that we all closed our menus and decided to share. We ordered the red velvet pancakes, cran orange pancakes, side of bacon, sausage and the beef tips.  Once we got our food we devoured everything! There wasn't one thing left! The pancakes were moist and full of flavor. The beef tips were perfectly marinated and juicy!   SO GOOD!  I love little mom n pop shops! By the time we left we felt like a part of the Griddle family.   I'll definitely be back every weekend.  :)",

Syrup tasted watered down, my fried chicken had powdered sugar poured all on top like a dressing YUCK and the waffles tasted like old batter half cooked. My kids didn't even eat their food either. Strike 3. Went to pay for the bill and the guy asks me how was my experience? I told him their service was awful and their food was horrible! He then asked me how could they have made it better? Told him his servers need to be more attentive and have better attitudes. Did he comp our food NO! We will not be back.",

They're service is very unproductive, they almost have no professionalism and knowledge to what the waitstaff need to say or do. The very first waitress that we had was very pleasant, but the second and third time sucked ass. We had to ask for this and that too many times. The food is also inconsistent, the third time I went I ordered \"Griddle combo or something like that\". I asked for fruit instead of the house hash for $1. So when it came, it was incorrect and the portion size were so small. Here's an example, house hash, mushrooms,spinach, onions, and chicken. Portions came out in that order and there was literally 4 pieces of chicken that were the size of croutons . Pathetic! For $10.   VERY OVERRATED. Just order pancakes and that's it, otherwise you will be disappointed.",

The air conditioner was not working in the middle of summer in Vegas so it felt like an oven in there. The food was awful. I will be honest and say that I know it's the \"griddle\" so I probably should have tried the pancakes but since I was on my best behavior I had a cobb salad. I believe any item worthy of being put on a menu should be great no matter the feature. This cobb salad was not a cobb at all. I don't know what the heck this salad was but it didn't even come close. First of all, a cobb has iceberg lettuce, not arugula. Secondly, where were all the traditional toppings of the cobb? Some bacon bits, tomatoes, blue cheese, and packaged turkey meat just don't cut it. How in the heck can a restaurant be successful if you cannot even get the most popular salad in the world right?

    "text": "I don't usually post reviews on Yelp however this is necessary. My boyfriend and I went here for the 1st time because we have heard great things about this place. We were not impressed! I ordered the lemon blueberry pancakes with cream cheese, boyfriend ordered philly skillet. Three cups of coffee later, finally got our food. My boyfriends food was ok, my pancakes however were completely uncooked after cutting into them. They offered to remake them, fine. After watching multiple tables get served food and 30 more mins of waiting, still no pancakes. You would think they would have made my breakfast a priority considering we have been there for a long time already. The server even handed us the bill before the pancakes were even served. We ended up asking them to take it off the bill because my boyfriend was already done and I was already frustrated. We were excited to try this place, however we will never return here again.",

They sat us and it took about 20 minutes to get a drink. I wanted to order the parfait but was curious what kind of yogurt was in it, (greek or regular). The waiter said, \"I've never sold one and I don't know what it is.\" Well thats helpful and seems promising.   Our breakfast came but was missing many things. They trickled in but seemeed to take forever. By the time one was done with their meal the next pieve xould roll in. Pancakes were ordered but somehow syrup was never delivered and was not on the table. Coffee and water refills had to be requested instead of offered. After our plates sat empty for 20 minutes the bill came. We needed it split and figured it was easiest if we let them do it with checks versus giving 3 cards to try and figure it out. The waiter comes over after another waiter took it to him and says, \"I know you want this split but I don't remember who got what\" Simply, zero skills this guy had because apparently ordering in a circle doesn't have a rhyme or reason. He then goes to split it and returns with the craziest thing I've ever heard, \"My manager has requested you come up there. He's really controlling and I had it but he wants to do it.\" We proceed to the counter with the check and cards in hand. The manager was less than plesant. I will NEVER return there nor refer people there for breakfast or lunch.",

    "text": "Ate there a few weeks ago but wanted to give my review a little distance from my visit for a \"cooling off period\" to see if my feelings would change, nope, didn't help.  So totally bummed.  I read and heard very mixed reviews about this place but wanted to check it out myself because those that reviewed it really well had some very compelling arguments as to why they loved this place.  I'm a caterer so I understand that you just can't please some people and I don't give credibility to bad reviews until I check it out myself.   I was hoping that those that had bad reviews just had no taste or were just angry people that were hard to please.  Well I'm not an angry person and I'm reasonable in my expectations of others and boy did this place miss the mark on all accounts.  Food: POOR QUALITY-can you possibly find cheaper products?  I know your in business to make a buck but do you have to up your profit margin so high that you cheat your customers of decent quality?  Service: UMM......who is my waiter?  Several people running around but I can't figure out who does what?!  I think the big guy was my waiter, but I'm not sure.  I saw him once when he took my order and then he never graced me with his presence again during my visit-oh wait, he did take my money but really didn't care that I seemed a little miffed at being ignored.  Guess I'm not a VIP.  You could tell there were some people in there that made the \"cool kid cut\" and they seemed to get personal attention but not the little people (who by the way will still be there when the cool kids find another hang out).  Value: see  \"food\" category above.  I don't mind paying for good quality-I know how much good products cost but I refuse to pay those kind of prices for crap.  I HATE giving reviews like this so if I ever find myself in a spot like this, I do try to look for SOME positive, the pancakes were great but they are not enough to bring me back.  Pancakes are a dime a dozen in this town.  whah whah whah.... on to bigger and better home fries that aren't hard in the middle.",

( i was already wanting to leave). 50 min later ( without anyone checking on us) our food finally comes out ( only half the order) no pesto melt. no syrup, no condiments with our order so i get up and go get it myself.  five min later the pesto melt comes out. now i have to say the pancakes were beautiful, definitely tasty. as far as the pesto melt, blah super oily i didnt even want to eat it. with the experience with the service and the tired turtle speed i was left dissapointed and debating on even returning. food 3 1/2 because of the tasty red velvet pancakes and 1 on customer service and speed!!!! so i would highly consider or getting new staff or train them to be friendly and lay off the oil with the pesto.",

Super friendly staff and really tasty food. I wish I could say every dish was spot on, but we've hit a few bumps in the road. While the pancakes, which come in myriad flavors, and the waffle have always been outstanding for me, my boyfriend got the chicken fried steak one day for lunch and it was less than stellar. The skillets are also pretty tasty and come in good portions. They charge $1.99 EACH for whipped cream and strawberries which is kind of ridiculous. We ordered them both for our red velvet pancakes without realizing just how pricey it really was. That was a bit of a disappointment. They know how to do pancakes though. I've had the red velvet, orange cranberry, and buckwheat and they've all been quite tasty. Someone in another review said they were dry; I disagree.  Baja, the owner, is really friendly and does a great job providing wonderful customer service. I haven't been for lunch, but I've heard the burgers are delish.",

The pumpkin pancakes were terrible bitter and undercooked. We were without service for 15 mins, bypassed multiple times, had to go ask for our check 3 times before I had to just get up and get it. Absolutely ridiculous, horrible service and just a really awful experience. I might not come here anymore. I'll stick with Babystacks.",

It was surprisingly not heavy or greasy at all!  Cooked very nicely.  Eggs were done right, potatoes were chunky, toast was buttery, pancakes were flavorful and a nice consistency.    Lots of fun sounding pancake options including peanut butter, coconut, red velvet, marble and so on.    We had 2 breakfasts, 2 coffees, and leftovers to take home for $22. Not bad at all.

    "text": "So I decided after a long day of studying to come into this place. The first thing I did was walk into it, where I was greeted by a host. But I just stood there where there were clearly open tables. So I just stood there....until after 5 minutes I asked if I could sit down. Finally, when i decide to sit down, the busser asked me what beverage I wanted. I got my orange juice. Another 15 minutes passes and no server has greeted me yet, and I'm practically done with my juice. Finally I get slightly frustrated and ask for the bill. The server gives me the bill with no apology or anything. I have never experienced service like this. They didn't even acknowledge me. I'm never going here again and encouraging my friends to not come here as well. I give it 2 stars only because the host and the the busser helped me out",

    "text": "Went to Stacks and Yolks for the first time today, everyone talks about how great the food is....well for starters, I ordered a cup of coffee, the cup had lipstick all over it. I also asked for water, the water didn't come until I was almost done with my food. The silverware was dirty.   Once the food came, the two skillets didn't have the avocado on it like it was ordered, the skillets were cold. The meat scrambler that I ordered with a biscuit and gravy came out cold, and the home fries was a toss up on if they were cooked or not. Considering I spent 50.00 on food, I would have expected the quality of the food to be better than it was.   The food servers (not sure who was ours since so many came over and checked on us) were great!!! The best part was the customer service. The food was not good and I felt like it was just thrown on the plate and served cold. Will not be back.",

Otherwise their food was good and fairly quick. I would like to go back and try their pancakes because I heard they have over 10 kinds of different batter. I just had eggs and apple sausage which was good and tasted pretty fresh. It came with s side of seasoned home fries (potatoes, not actual fries) but I didn't eat them cause I was staying away from the starch but they looked amazing.",

Other than that coming here for the first time was a mistake. Not because it was busy but from the food to service wasn't worth it. We got seated pretty fast and we sat right where the food was coming out. The expo guy was useless. The way he was talking to servers was rude and cussed knowing my 4 year old is sitting right there. He doesn't see the food in the window and makes someone else get it and they all seemed to be running around like chickens with no heads no organization at all and nothing is getting done. Tell me why servers takes one plate out at a time like hello you have two hands. I saw one server come to her moms table takes a bit of her sandwich and goes to grab customers food orders that's been sitting there getting cold brings it out and doesn't bother to even wash her hands disgusting. When we got our food my hash browns was cold, my kids pancakes and bacon was warm I guess and our skillet thinking the food would be hot no it wasn't it was cold besides the eggs on top and I watched it come out the window fresh but why the hell would it be cold when they just put it out don't make sense. No one checked on us we had to flag servers down for things like refill coffees and clean forks because they were all dirty. We got our checks before anyone could even ask or notice our food was cold so nasty and now I got a tummy  ache. Not worth going to you guys need new people I was literally going to get up and run that all by myself I'm sure I'd do a better job at it and have my partner step in the back and run that kitchen making sure the food gets out on time and still hot. Oh I almost forgot the expo guy was saying it's ok if it's out late everyone can wait make them wait like wth.",

    "text": "I would give this place 0 stars if I could. My boyfriend and I have been here 3 times total and the only reason we decided to give it another try was because, Brandon, was our server. Gave us great customer service and food came out good. When we didn't have him the service was AWFUL. I'm a server so I totally get it but this place the staff walks around with their heads cut off & gives horrible customer service which I don't understand since it's a very small restaurant and has too many people on staff?? Constantly had to ask for refills, bring our bill and they don't even ask how the food was. I applied to this place after the first visit really wanting to change customer service, Brandon (the manager) told me to come in to give my application so I can start right away. I got a phone call a week later and was told to come in for an interview.... came in and one of the Assistant managers (she has a tattoo sleeve) says \"oh no one called you? Brandon is out of town. I don't know why he lets me deal with this kind of stuff\" like what honey???? Deal with what?? A simple phone call? Came in a few days later for my interview again and the same AM interviewed me... had me wait outside in the hot heat for 30 mins while her and the staff were staring at me. She said I was hired and said I will receive a phone call for my start date.... that was about a month ago and nothing! I ended up getting a job at PTs Gold which is WAY better and has a great reputation, a company I 'am actually proud to be a part of ! Stalks and Yolks is so disappointing, servers need to pay attention and act like they give a crap. We would of continued to come because of Brandon but he no longer works their so their is no reason to keep going.  Good food but the service ISN'T WORTH IT. HORRIBLE and RUDE STAFF!",

And when we were finally seated, we had to squeeze behind another table just to sit down. Then we waited about 5 minutes just for our drink order to be taken! Once we received those, it was another 15 minutes before we got our food order taken. I assume it because there is only 1 cook, so they needed to space out the orders.  As for the food, it came out quick and correct! The home fries, eggs, and sausage were delicious!! I also ordered the short stack of cinnamon pancakes! They were great, there was just a little too much of a cinnamon after-taste! Just a little strong for my liking!  This is our second time here, and we just don't think we will come back. The staff was friendly but not super impressive. And the space was just too small to feel comfortable.",

    "text": "This place came highly recommended as a break from the traditional \"Egg Works\" Mecca most make in Vegas. Hopes were high even though yelp showed up with 3.5 stars (ehhh. Whatcha gonna do?). We showed up and were greeted and sat immediately (early morning before the rush) and given drinks. Once we ordered though, it was all downhill from there. The service went from friendly to nonexistent, the food took a considerably long time to come out and drinks often times ended up drier than the desert dunes across the road before a refill was even conceived. My order came out incorrect but there wasn't anyone to let know about this (as they were off doing their own thing without concern) and frankly it would have taken twice as long to get it corrected - not worth it. The waitress eventually came by and asked if we wanted the check, which we gratefully requested so we could get out of there, though we asked for more water - you'd have thought I sold her firstborn to the gypsies. She took our card, I asked again about water and she decided not to acknowledge or respond. I was happy to eventually get my card back after 5-7 minutes (I don't care to have someone else keep my card laying around on the counter for that long) and then leave. It'll be back to egg works for me - even with all the tourist crowds and stupid long wait times.",

It took at least 20 minutes to get the change, Maybe more. I called my wife shortly after turning in my ticket.l, went back to look at the call log,l. Sure enough it was 15 mins. After I had asked multiple times for the change back. They were only taking cash. So I needed change to leave tip. The OWNER ( not sure his name, but his pictures are posted on the shrine for him)he was running the register. So in this 20+ min span, I watched him walk to the back at least 3 separate times. Finally the manager could see my frustration so he stopped what he was doing to get my change. Sucks because I've been here before and had a good experience. But this time was horrible.",

The crowd was about the same compared to the first visit, about a 15 min wait to be seated, but it took them about 10 mins just to get us a cup of coffee.  There were plenty of servers whizzing by, but it seemed we were invisible for about 10 mins when we sat down.  After that, it didn't change much.  Our order wasn't accurate, we didn't get the hot sauce or extra napkins we asked for.  Our tip was less than we normally leave to reflect that.    HOWEVER, having said all of that, I'd most likely return cause the food is really good.",

I could not even cut through it with a fork it was so tough. I tore a pieces off with my fingers and decided to feed it to the pigeons outside. Guess what?

    "text": "Being a sweet foodie on the hunt for delicious spots in Vegas I was excited to try this place. I was super disappointed in the service, cleanliness was lacking, and the food was bland. My friend and I had one of their skillets with a side of biscuits and gravy. She had the Philly skillet and I had the western skillet. We both thought the food lacked flavor and the biscuit was on the harder side. The waiter asked how the food was and before I could address any concerns stormed away. Another girl came up and asked if things were okay because you could tell I didn't eat my breakfast. I said it was just okay and I wasn't impressed. She apologized and that was it. There was no fixing the issue or offering another meal that may have actually changed my mind about this place. My friend noticed that the dishes and cups were dirty. Looks like this place hasn't learned much since being on Dirty Dining. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, nor will we be back.",

No attempt to redeem themselves was made (i.e. remake the order, order something else, etc.). They just came to the table saying they took $7 off of the bill. Maybe the other two locations are doing better. Avoid at all costs if you have taste buds.",

Seriously, these things were unreal. It was their S'more pancake and this thing was heaven on a plate. Nothing short of incredible. I mean, look at those toasted marshmallows on top. The food was so good that we went back a second time before we left, so if that gives you any clue as to how much I liked it, it was a lot.  The restaurant and service were great too. We were there pretty early so it wasn't busy at all. I'm not sure how it is when it's packed, but it did feel like it can get real crammed in there real quick. But hey, if that's what you gotta put up with to have these S'more pancakes, well then you do what you gotta do.",

We had three different servers come to our table asking for drink refills or if we needed anything. The servers were also hilarious, making up jokes as we ordered food. The location is easy to get to as it is right off the 215. The food was phenominal. I had ordered chicken and waffles per recommendation of my friend. To my surprise, it was superb. The chicken was cooked perfectly, not burned or dry. The flavor of the waffle was great too! It wasnt too sugary.  If you are looking for a quick and flavorful breakfast, you should check this place out. The price for the breakfast is average compared to other breakfast joints in the Las Vegas area.",

We were asked to wait outside until our table was ready but it was cold so I didn't want to take the kids outside so we found an area in the back. We were seated within 5 mins and everything was smooth sailing  after that.  The kids ordered the pancakes and bacon with whipped cream and surprisingly ate almost all of it! My husband had ham and jalapeno omelette and I ordered the chicken fried steak. Everything was done well but our server Rudy was really the reason why I would come back.  He was very personable and acknowledged the small hiccups immediately. When dining out it's often just as much (or more) about the experience than it is about the food.",

I am 6'1 250lbs and i could not even finish half of them. What is the point of serving pancakes that big? The worst part is I got charged $19 for some pancakes with some diced up ham in them. I'd rather pay $10 for normal sized pancakes that would've filled me up and I would've finished. And the pancakes were not even that good, probably a 6/10. Word of advice downsize your pancakes because nobody will finish them instead of just upselling customers. Or atleast have the waiter let you know that 3 pancakes are impossible to finish if one person orders them.",

    "text": "My friend was in from out of town so we decided to give this place a try. They have a big menu, highlighting both breakfast and lunch options. The place itself is well decorated and cute. I asked our server what the popular items were and he was more than helpful. After spending some time looking at the menu, we decided to go with the day's special: Meat skillet served over their house fries (cubed potatoes) with cheese on top. I went with the eggs over easy and my friend decided on scrambled. This skillet was just absolutely delicious! It was meaty, cheesy and my eggs were cooked perfectly.   We came back the next day since our husbands showed interest in this place.   This time I ordered the Garden Skillet and added sausage to it and my husband ordered the French toast stack. I was more than pleased with my dish. It was delicious and the veggies and potatoes were cooked just the way I like them. My husband like the French toast, but compared to their waffles and pancakes they were nothing special sadly. They were small pieces and weren't exactly \"stacked\". They were also completely covered in powdered sugar. He wasn't exactly satisfied at the end. I highly recommend getting the pancakes or waffles instead of the French toast. Aside from that hiccup, everything else tasted great.   Service: Staff can be a bit forgetful, but I think part of the problem is the communication between them. Sometimes one person will take your order than a different person shows up asking the same thing. I understand things can get a bit hectic, but it also just feels repetitive. Maybe this would be the other thing I would say they need just a bit of improvement on. I do also wish they would have had other coffee items aside from just plain coffee given they are a breakfast place, or at least a cold brew option.   Overall, it's a great little place with friendly staff. The Skillets seem to be one of their strengths aside from pancakes and waffles. I would give this place another try and try other different menu items since the skillets were absolutely delicious! I do recommend trying this place.",

I was soooo hungry when the food arrived, the potatoes in the skillet were phenomenal and the carne asada burrito was tasty too! The Monterey skillet comes with chicken, veggies, feta and the potatoes but mine was probably 80 percent potatoes which was a little disappointing.

    "text": "We went for a late breakfast during winter break, and they were still pretty packed, so these guys must be doing something right. Unfortunately, it's not the yolks. I ordered a skillet breakfast with over easy eggs. Three eggs come with the skillet, and one was over easy, the second over medium, and the third over hard. :/  I really expect more from a breakfast joint; even Denny's gets my eggs right. Hubs ordered the Alabama Slamma pancakes, and those were tasty. The biscuits and gravy side was meh, too. The gravy has very little sausage flavor. Stick to their stacks and skip the yolks. All in all, we are unlikely to return. There are just to many better options in this area. Pros: wide menu selection, good service for coffee refills (our mugs were never empty), cute decor Cons: Eggs not prepared as ordered, our server never returned to check on us (so I couldn't even say anything to her), half the restaurant gets blasted with outside air every time door opens. Overall: we'll pass",

The hostess who sat us was awesome,  the food was delicious,  our waitress however was rather rude, kept cutting my daughter off as she was trying to order and saying \"oh, I thought you wanted french toast\" (I wanted french toast not my daughter)  and we felt like we were being rushed through our breakfast, about 5 minutes after we received our food we also received our check (also rude).    Would recommend the food any day but defiantly need to work on the staff.",

Within the last few months, my last three experiences have progressively gotten worse.  Our eggs and my pancakes  were cold. My father order a waffle with NO powdered sugar (which the waitress told us it doesn't come on the waffle); but the waffle still came with it. Once it was sent back to the kitchen, we had to ASK for the waffle 15-20 minutes later. When it did finally come, it was over cooked. There wasn't one water refill during the meal. The staff is friendly but seemingly undertrained and the restaurant is obviously mismanaged. Stacks and yolks have gone from 1st to WORST.",

When we walked in we were greeted and seated right away. They had a wide range to choose from but I was in a waffle type of mood. So I ended up ordering the Belgian Waffles. The waffle presentation was definitely pretty and unique that it came out in the shape of a flower. The waffle itself was light  and fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside. Overall had a great experience and will be returning.",

My hopes were high as we arrived because the place was busy with families and hipsters alike. The staff is very friendly, knowledgeable and attentive and the decor is perfect for a casual breakfast and lunch spot.   But it's all about the food, right? My wife had the French toast with a side of two eggs, over easy, and bacon. It was very tasty and she enjoyed it. My son (4) had the kid's pancake and bacon. The flavor was good but it was over cooked on one side and you couldn't cut through it with a fork alone. These pancakes require a fork and knife. I had a hankering for biscuits and gravy and they were extra disappointing. Neither were homemade. Rather than light flaky biscuits these are heavy and doughy. The gravy is straight out of a package and isn't doctored up with any sausage or additional flavor at all. Even my wife who will eat any version of biscuits and gravy found this offering blah.   The lunch offerings looked pretty tasty and I wished I had chosen the patty melt. I'll give it another go for lunch but won't return for breakfast.",

There's no waiting room inside, so we had to then wait outside for something to open up. I'm pretty easy going so no problem.  We were seated in a booth in the back of the restaurant, where it seemed we were forgotten. We got water after 10min or so. Then another 10min later we got some of the worst coffee ever. Eventually we saw out actual server who took our order and apologized for the wait.  So then we waited and waited for food and new coffee. The server brought food to the table....but it wasn't anything that we ordered. So it went back and we waited again.  We got our food. My son was happy with his smiley face pancake. Hubby said the formerly awesome breakfast burrito was just ok and had to be drowned in cholula for flavor. I got the Country Combo. Scrambled eggs, bland potatoes, and a biscuit with a single sausage patty laying on top with some packet style \"country \" gravy. It was so sad. All that trouble for a less than mediocre breakfast. I had the Country Combo before and it was amazing. Sorry Stacks. I like to support local business, but you have lots of competition out there that blows you away. If I get a hankering for a specialty pancake, I might be back.   *********************************** I've been here maybe 5 times. The food is always great. The servers are very nice. When it gets busy, it can take awhile to get your food. I've tried a few different variations of pancakes. Lemon cake with blueberries was good. The Always November (pumpkin with cream cheese and whipped cream)  is to die for. Coffee is great. I've also had their biscuits and gravy. Quite yummy. Their breakfast burrito has grilled onions in it and is delicious! Give them a try!",

First of they charged us $8.99 for kids meal that is regularly $4.99 which I understand people makes mistakes. They apologized and gave us a corrected receipt. That's when we discovered that they also charged us $2.99 for apple juice when we only ordered water for our son. When we told them abt it, we didn't get a simple \"We're sorry\" just showed us the receipt that they took it out. Almost felt like they didn't believe us. Considering there's 2 mistakes in one receipt, you would think they would be more apologetic, again i'm not asking for any thing special. Just a simple \"we're sorry\" instead, we almost felt like we were hassling them for pointing it out or even worse, making it up. Worst feeling from eating from this establishment. Now i know why this place only has 3 stars. We should've trusted Yelp! Never ever going to this place again!!",

The hostess seemed more concerned with speaking to the black male server with the beard rather than paying attention to the patrons.  She called us the wrong family 3x.  We were finally sat 20 mins later and asked for a high chair but she left.  A blond girl came by to bring silverware and we asked her for a high chair.  She brought the high chair and left and no server came by for another 10 minutes to get our drink order with a \"has anyone gotten your drinks\".  At this point we watched the hostess and server talking, 3-4 other servers walk past us multiple times, and seems like everyone is just the blind leading the blind. We received our drinks and then another 15 minutes went by and a taller white male server said \"do you guys still need more time or are you ready to order\".  I said to the server \"we were never needing more time\".  We finally ordered at 23 minutes after being sat.  Our 2 year old was starving and irritable, and we asked if there were any crackers and we were told there were not.  It took 15-20 minutes to get our food from there and we were served with the same tables that sat way after us.  It's really unfortunate the teams lack leadership and structure because as a former server, i try to be understanding to busy restaurants but this is not a big restaurant and coming from both breakfast spots and fine dining, there was no reason they couldn't handle it with 5-6 open tables at the time we were placing our drink order when it's more a 3 server set up.   If you want good food they definitely have it, but save your tip and order it to go.",

I even stole a bite, or four, from my boyfriend's meat lovers scramble and it was so good! The potatoes mixed in with the egg and meats were moist and huge chunks!

I usually prefer my gravy with meat but I ordered a side of sausage to satisfy my carnivorous needs. The others in our party had a very yummy BLT, and various omelets. The BLT had very nicely crisp bacon and fresh vegetables The omelett eaters were not really impressed. However, they are hard to please since they are used to farm fresh eggs with a stronger eggy taste. They thought the omelets were not very flavorfull. They looked beautiful! Ample portions that were beautifully presented. The service was quick and friendly. I wish I could remember our servers name. He was such a delight, and deserves to be recognized. I would recommend this restaurant and will definitely be back.",

    "text": "I discovered this place by driving by since it's close to my house. It's a small place that gives me a California vibe. I like the place because I spotted a celebrity on my 1st visit and then spotted him many times there after. I think he has a stake in this business since he eats here every morning when he's not out filming his MTV show. I also heard him talking business strategies with the owner who has ties to UFC fighting.  My brother went to school with this celebrity and I'm a big fan of the show he hosts so it's fun to talk with him when he recognizes me. Other members of the MTV show have worked at this location as servers off and on since it opened. So in conclusion it's a perfectly fine breakfast place but even better if you want to spot celebrities.",

My husband had an omelet with turkey sausage, tomato and cheese. The pancake was fluffy with a good amount of blueberries and lemon flavor. Would get again. Eggs were well cooked, not over done. Bacon crispy. Hubby said the omelet was good.  I would have given them 5 stars but the food was only a little warm. They seems to have plenty of servers so I don't understand how the food didn't get to us still hot.  We were on a time limit that morning or I would have sent it back.  But even it being a little warm the food was tasty.  I will be willing to give them one more try.",

It took forever to get someone to take our order and for our food to arrive. I saw it sitting in the kitchen window for quite some time, and then it was moved to the serving counter for a long time. About two or three servers passed by the counter and just let it sit there. It was cold by the time it landed on our table. My bf ordered a breakfast burrito with added sour cream. No sour cream and it was really greasy. He couldn't even finish it. My pancakes were cold and hard. If we had received some kind of niceties from the staff it would have made our experience a little less sour!  Sucks because I had high hopes for this place!",

However, checks took almost 25 mins to be passed out. A young aggressive, female cashier stood in front of me in time to pay my bill. She was speaking on the phone the whole time during our 6 minute encounter.  Which makes it 26 minutes to pay my bill, more time than it took to eat. I COULD NOT BELIEVE MY EARS... She was criticizing the waitstaff in front of everyone standing close by to register.   Do you not want my money? Poor management. Taking the payment is the last memory a guest should have and she really put a poor taste in my mouth. My poor server was stretched thin running inside and out to be talked about in plain view of customers. The servers and cooks really seem to make this place run. Management owes them BIG $",

We arrived on a Sunday at 2pm and this place closes at 3pm so we were very surprised to see a line and we ended up waiting about 15 mins in the rain so I was really hoping the food would be outstanding.   The small restaurant is very colorful and has a fun vibe so things started off well. We both ordered freshly squeezed orange juice and it was fantastic with the perfect amount of pulp. Next came our egg breakfasts, mine with bacon and his with ham. The portions are huge here and both plates were very delicious, no complaints and we would definitely order them again.   Now to the disappointments. I ordered a single stack of the lemon & blueberry pancake and it was very dense, no fluffiness, no moisture and no lemon flavor. The portion was huge but I didn't want it :( Next came the single portion of the French toast which again was dense and covered in cinnamon which wasn't pleasing. Both sweets left us regretting we ordered them.   The service was fantastic and our waiter was a funny one which I always love.   I hope someone reads this who can make improvements on the pancakes & french toast.   Overall we enjoyed ourselves except for the sweets.",

    "text": "We used to come here often when they first opened, but stopped about two years  ago because food quality and service had steadily gone downhill.  Today we met friends and this was their choice, so we went. First...there were 5 of us (all adults).  We were seated at a booth for 4 in the back next to the women's restroom with a chair in the aisle.  Now, there was not room for patrons to reach restroom with the aisle jammed up and bathroom smells were unpleasant. Food was meh.  All of our pancakes were dense and \"doughy\", like they were not thoroughly cooked.  Pumpkin pancakes had no pumpkin flavor. I could,probably count on one hand the number of blueberries in my pancakes.   Bacon was burned (black), not just \"crispy\", and my eggs over easy had yolks that were near hard boiled and not runny. Just a plain disappointing meal, especially for the price. My coffee cup was chipped and when I mentioned it to server, she said , \"Oh, it is not a big deal, the chip is on the outside!\"  (Just throw it away...cups are cheap!) None of the five of us had anything positive to say about their meal.  Restroom was filthy.  I don't think the floor had been mopped in moths.  One star for the decent service. Sorry, we won't be back anytime soon, even at the request of someone else.",

    "text": "We have been to Stacks & Yolks many times and have always enjoyed our experience and food. We were seated very quickly and were walked our drink order. We ordered two coffees with a side of whipped cream rather than cream and two waters. We were served one cup of coffee and had to ask for the second one.  We were brought FOUR BOWLS of whipped cream. And had to ask again for water. We ordered our food, a Carne Asada Skillet and a Great Gobbler skillet and a side of pancakes for each of us. We waited probably the average amount of time for our food to be served. When the waiter brought the two skillets to the table, he brought the wrong ones. Apparently the Great Gobbler Skillet was on of the ones he brought but when he said what it was it was not correct. After they confirmed that it was in fact then Great Gobbler Skillet, he brought it back and it was already pretty cold, but edible. They remade the Carne Asada Skillet and it turned out as expected. My fiance ordered cinnamon pancakes and when they were brought out they tasted like wheat bread. Zero flavor. Asked for them to be remade. I ordered a pumpkin pancake and it was cold when I got it. Ate a few bites and called it day. Wasn't going to fight it. When the replacement pancakes were brought out, they were burnt, tasted like sour wheat bread. We asked for them to be taken off our bill, which they did. Our skillets came with toast and we both ordered what type we wanted. My fiance had to ask for his toast to come and I told them to forget about mine. When we went to pay they did take 10% off our bill which was nice. The cashier said they had to hire people on the fly. The entire operation of the restaurant seems to have changed. Everyone is going all over the place and there is no communication between the workers. Very disappointing. We probably won't be back.",

It was nice seeing the other people that came in after me get there food. Sarcasm... Go find a different breakfast and lunch place. You'll probably get your food at least. I don't know even why I left any money on the table for the iced tea I got. Hey, at least I got that... Should've left a quarter. Used to eat there a lot.

His meal was great, mine was really good as well but it to me did not taste like a belgian waffle.  it tasted almost like it was pancake batter more then anything.

I am pretty sure churro styled french toast, along with the 1/2 lb of butter AND the maple syrup and the egg whites (gotta watch the cholesterol) with bacon, that meal was easily 3000 calories of goodness.  After three bites I felt like my mouth had been transported to a place that had unicorns making love to dolphins surfing a rainbow to the leprechauns gold. After a few hours though, I did notice a rather strong reaction starting to rise in my body. No matter what pain I suffered afterwards... just those moments where my tastebuds were transported to the land of make believe, it was worth it. And the server/host dude was awesome, always had a smile, talked witht he patrons, made everyone feel good. Would definitely go there again, this time though, I will not have the churro styled french toast. I do not think I could replicate that feeling and if I tried, i would be disappointed.  Anyone disagreeing with me or putting down less than 4 stars, they obviously just needed to find something to pick at and whine about.. eff them...",

The staff appeared to be mostly high school/early college students but they were all so polite and attentive! They have some delicious sounding pancake creations but I am never a sweet person in the morning. I did notice they offer protein pancakes though, which is something I might consider next time! We ordered our food and it was out within 10 minutes, they really hustle back in the kitchen. Overall I really enjoyed my breakfast & experience here!",

    "text": "This was my second visit to Stacks and Yolks on Durango. To say that this visit was disappointing, would be an understatement! While their was eight of us and we did anticipate a little bit of a wait for food, we did not expect to wait almost an hour for our food! We were served in three separate shifts. First, the kids (2) got served after waiting 35 minutes. Then, 10 minutes later three adults got served, then 10 minutes later another adult got served, then finally 15 minutes later the two remaining adults got served! However, one of those meals was served incorrect, and had to be brought back because it was wrong! Ten minutes later the correct meal was brought to the gentlemen. When we asked to speak to the manager, We were told that he would be right over. He never came over to speak to us! Then one of the other adults at the table went over to speak to the manager and asked for the last three meals to be comped because we had waited so long. The manager said very negatively that's not in my authority to do that, but I will take 10% off of everybody's bill. His negative attitude and lack of compassion really was very unprofessional! Needless to say our experience at stacks and yolks on Durango was a horrible one, and like I said earlier the managers lack of compassion was the icing on the cake.",

Needless to say the service suffered when the place only had 2 other tables of people. The food is what really disappointed. My friend ordered the corned beef and it looked disgusting. The portion size was so small it was insulting. Were they running out of corned beef? Aside from that the dish itself looked like stringy lunch meat chopped and over cooked then tossed with some bell peppers and potatoes. By the time we left another server had come in to work and things seemed less hectic yet we still had to wait 10+ minutes to get our check. We probably would've have waited even longer had we not just walked up to the register asked for it.",

I'm not sure where you guys are buying your bacon from but it is awful. The cashier charged a $37 tip on my boyfriends card when it was time to cash out.

Also, your a breakfast place, especially one that caters to weekend breakfast goers so does it make sense to not have items on your menu? If you don't have cottage cheese or olives run across the street to Vons and get some! Don't ever tell your customers your out of something at 8am on a Saturday morning. The coffee here taste like battery acid. When the waitress set our food down on the table my husband and I looked at each other both horrified. Both our dishes looked like roadkill molded into omelets. We each took one bite, paid the bill and left and drove across town and to a much better joint. Gross!!!",

We walked in and was quickly told by their only server, to find a seat anywhere, no HELLO, no GREETING, just FIND A SEAT.. but it was cool with me, he looked busy and I can understand because I've waited tables myself for 10 years.  So giving the restaurant and this server the benefit of the doubt, my husband and I sat down and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited patiently, until 10 minutes went by and another table that came in after us, was seated and given menus!!! That's when my patience ran out and I walked up to the person at the counter asking for a manager.  He said there was no manager available, at which point the only server came by and said, \"I'll be right with you guys\".. no SORRY, no APOLOGY, just \"I'm gonna be right with you guys\" .. I told the server I've been here for 10 minutes waiting patiently for anyone to greet us, say hello, and at least give us a menu.  The server pointed to the busser, rolled his eyes and said she was supposed  to do that, that's her job.. He said, we're really busy, to which I told him that was no excuse to completely ignore someone that he himself noticed when we walked in and told us to have a seat.  I said, we're just gonna go, to which he sarcastically responded, \"BYE!\" .. I wonder how many other customers they treat this way, when there isn't a manager on staff to hold them accountable?",

We did have to wait a bit longer, and I felt the hostess was not knowledgable about how to figure out what tables will clear out to make the table of 8 the best. I felt like I saw quite a lot smaller tables fill up that came after us-that had she figured it out, could've sat our party a little sooner. It wasn't that big of a deal, just something I noticed.   On to the service and food. The OJ was fresh, which was nice. I hate bottled fake OJ. I definitely recommend trying at least one of their delicious & different pancake batters. I tried the peanut butter pancake and added chocolate chips to it...SO GOOD. I made it a combo, because I usually just eat eggs. The single stack is HUGE, and great to try with others. My husband had the corned beef skillet-one is fresh, and one is canned. He chose the fresh one. Everyone else at the table enjoyed their food. We had 4 children, and they all enjoyed their food. The waiter was very good, and very nice. It was a bit warm in the rest, but it was super cold out today, so it was actually kind of nice to take sweaters off.  No real complaints on food. We are visiting from out of town, and a part of me wants to go back so I can try a different batter. They were out of mint, and I would like to try that one out.",

I finally got my pancakes and they were raw, now keep in mind is that I am 9 months pregnant. I could literally smell the raw batter, I tell the sever and they proceed to get me a new plate and again, UNDERCOOKED. Not to mention the owner's whole family was in there with two small children under the age of 2 and they were just walking in and out of the kitchen, getting their food before anyone else. And the two children were running in the kitchen, in front of servers that had their hands full of food. I just thought it was really unprofessional to have their whole family in there while their restaurant is literally drowning and their just talking it up and eating before anyone else.",

I'm as ready for the nightmare drive back to LA as I'll ever be. Big portions, good prices.  Big props to Mickey, he was incredibly friendly, courteous, and gave us great service. My girlfriend usually drinks about 3 cups of water with our meal and her cup was never empty - I don't think I've ever been able to say that before, especially impressive for a joint where you order at the counter! Keep doing the good work my friend!",

It took between 45-60 mins to get our order out, one of which was wrong, we took it anyway because we didn't want to wait another 45 mins. We werent the only ones. If we hadn't seen the people in front of us get their order 10 mins before we actually got ours we would have walked out. The table seated after us did.  The manager (I'm assuming) was apologetic, however no communication about our order, wait time, etc. From the staff or mgmt. No quick snack to hold over the customers while the kitchen gets it's shit in order.  Bottom line, I won't waste my time or money here again.",

Then yesterday, I had the \"Alabama Slamma\" and being a fan of peanut butter already, it was everything I could hope for topped with bananas, chocolate chips and almonds with whipped cream. I can't wait to visit again! I have to try all the signature stacks! Oh and those cakes are huge which in my mind justifies the price!",

My husband had the chocolate chip pancake with eggs, chicken fried steak and potatoes. The food was great! Potatoes need a little seasoning or even some bits of fried peppers in them.

I came here because a couple girlfriends came here a few weeks ago on their Vegas vacation. Their schedule was booked so I met them at the griddle. (I already are breakfast but one girlfriend insisted I take her leftover for my daughter) So I didn't get to try the food fresh when it was ordered, since I came at the end of their meal.  It had apple slices and cinnamon which was amazing. The pancakes were so thick and it was as big as the plate! So it was hard fitting it in the to-go box.   Weeks passed, I passed by it on my daily drive when it finally hit me...gotta eat here one day.   I came for breakfast yesterday, it was good.   Walking in was kinda weird. You're not sure if you seat yourself or get seated by the host. She was a quirky tall blonde chick who had the attention span of a squirrel.  It was hard to get accommodated with our drinks and menus in a timely manner. And as we were reviewing the menu, she tells us there's an additional menu up at the front on the wall.   My boyfriend mentioned it was our first time, then out of nowhere we had a server switch. The \"owners best friend\" as he told us, was friendly.  He told us to not try the pancakes and explore the menu. He hooked it up with mini pancakes.  We noticed the chicken and waffles and our server said they were better than roscoes.  I asked if he's tried roscoes and he didnt which got me thinking \"how can you say these are better than roscoes if you haven't tried them either?!\" The waffle was very poorly made. It was flavorless and the corners were uncooked and soggy batter gushed out, which just means they were trying to rush my order. My boyfriend ordered the eggs benedict which was also 9.99 in my opinion a bit over priced. he had the crab cake which had a corner of it still frozen. Just the fact of having frozen food served to you is a big turn-off. My boyfriend ended up eating a piece and gave the rest to the dog.   I shouldn't have listened to the server, but I guess we all were happy with the fact that he was  going to give us free pancakes.  I might go back if a group of friends wants to meet up, other than that I probably wont be back for awhile.  Service was alright parking was plenty  food was overpriced and undercooked  next time if I do go I know I will go with what I initially plan on ordering... the pancakes",

However, being sat at a table next to the kitchen where the wait staff asses are constantly 2ft from your face while EATING was the last straw. Do NOT seat your patrons within 2ft of your wait staff asses!! The beverage bar/coffee kiosks were on 1 side, wait staff asses on the other, oh, and next to the register too. So customer asses were abundant. Nevermind the fact that there was another table kiddy corner to ours. My boyfriend was so close he could have eaten off that guy's plate. We heard more of their convo than ours. Having a table in the middle of a staff walkway and yet our coffee cups remained empty for long periods of time was awesome. It was a great experience!! I'll never go back. Thanks.",

We stood at the podium waiting to be seated for at least 7 minutes so we just sat ourselves.  It took a good ten minutes before someone cleared the table and brought us new silverware and took our drink order. The table next to us was there before we were and didn't even have menus yet.    The staff didn't check on us once during our meal. Our meal was bland. I could have made better eggs at home.  Overrated... Just plain Overrated",

My husband ordered the chicken fried steak which was beautiful, could cut with a fork BUT for a restaurant who has yolks in their name think they could cook a over medium egg.  The white was just barely cooked through.  The whites should be soft but solid and the yolk should be thick and runny not like water which it was.  The service was also lacking.  The waiter delivered our food asked if we needed anything else but we did not see him again until he picked up our check.  Never asked during our meal if we needed anything or ask how our meal was when he did pick up our check.  When he returned for our signature simply stated here you go.  No thank you ect., but the WORST came when I explained about his service and the eggs and that we would not be returning but wanted them to know why, his response was all of \"NOTED\".  Doubt he ever let management know. No apology, no give us one more chance.  The bill had already been paid so we weren't looking for a freebie but a little damage control would have been good or at least acknowledging a patron during their meal.",

Regardless of if its your waitress or not they are all attentive and take the time ask if you need anything.  As soon as I walked in I was greeted by Juanis and taken to a table where I was told that I chose a good time to come since they were \"slow\". I thought she was kidding as every table was taken including the ones outside and more people came in behind me but she said that there was always a constant line. In the 45 mins that I have been here I see what  she meant. I have seen kids, seniors, and young adults. Business people and people just enjoying the morning. The ambiance is very friendly and almost as if u were at a friends house dinner party.   The fact that I asked Juanis to make me whatever she wanted, and without even blink asked how I liked my eggs and if I wanted pancakes, was pretty cool. She then proceeded to go consult with another waitress and came back to say \" okay it will be out shortly.\" Next thing I knew I was brought three plates, one biscuit and gravy (that was amazingly and perfectly flavored) one philly steak skillet, and one side of a red velvet pancake with cream cheese and strawberries on top (not usually a fan of red velvet anything but after trying this pancakes I'm tempted to come here and just order this pancakes. They were moist, not very sweet, and the strawberries tasted fresh.)  And the whole time my cup of coffee was kept full and fresh. Now being Colombian, its hard for me to find a coffee that I enjoy drinking black, this coffee is definitely the exception. I've had 3 cups and still continue to drink it black as its that good.   The philly was... Omg delicious. Seasoned to perfection, just the right amount of potatoes, steak, onion, and eggs. For $12.00 the portion is perfect and the experience this place gives is very exceptional. I will definitely be back and hope that this experience is consistent. :-)",

First I ordered their \"marinated in unicorn tears\" steak. Hmm... I didn't think unicorn tears tasted like pure garlic! WAY TOO MUCH GARLIC FOR BREAKFAST! It came with breakfast potatoes and A biscuit and gravy. Again the potatoes were horrible. They were burnt on one side and under cooked on the other and very greasy. Last was the biscuit and gravy. Again very bad. The biscuit tasted like it was stale and microwaved. The gravy taste kind of like soap. I did not want to send it back because I don't like doing that but the waitress was really friendly and she wanted to give the cook a second chance.  So, I ordered the buttermilk pancakes. How bad could their pancakes be? Name of the place is stacks and yolks... It was very bad! I I could barely cut it with the knife they gave me. Is very tough and it didn't taste good. It was absolutely covered in powdered sugar so much that it poured off and got all over the table. I hope they weren't trying to hide something in the powdered sugar. That's why I hate sending things back.  I really regret wasting my time and money coming here.",

Server came over quickly, teas and coffees arrived, menus were perused, then orders placed...ENTER THE VOID!  Servers disappeared, bussers kept glasses full, but nothing... Our server was MIA and 20 minutes later a table that sat way before we did got food. Ours arrived about 20 minutes after that. I am all fine and dandy waiting for something to be cooked fresh (45 minute waits for Chicago pies is half the adventure), but what arrived came out lackluster, underwhelming, and just gross.   I got my eggs poached. They were served to me in a bowl and hadn't been drained. One of the eggs was cracked and it was like poached egg soup. What the gross! My friend stated that her meat had no seasonings. The biscuits and gravy were meh (how is there no sausage in the gravy?!). If you order something called huevos Mexicanos, you'd expect it to pack some heat! Not at Sucks and Yucks. Bland and subpar are it's speciality. Home fries which had nothing home-y about them. Not even a sprinkle of salt. Are y'all afraid of the spice rack or some shit? It was just bad, bad, bad. The ONLY redeeming thing about this visit was the pumpkin pancake I ordered. That ish was the bizzzz-ness!  WORST. BREAKFAST. EXPERIENCE. IN. LAS. VEGAS. I could have had 2x the food and it been more palatable at Denny's or IHOP! This is a mom & pop that makes you remember why you HATE going home for the holidays. So much potential down the drain.",

I recommend the Hobo Skillet; simple and delicious.   I put four stars because even though the food is amazing, there is always a short wait. At times there is also a crowded feeling, but that's only because so many people want to experience the great food Stacks and Yolks has to offer.",

We then sat for 15 min and our server hadn't been over to take our order so I asked hostess if they could come over bc we were ready and she said they would be over shortly and still no one came to take our order.  I asked for the check to pay for our coffees and simply said \"sorry.\" As I'm paying for my check the family of 4 behind us also got up and asked to pay for their juices bc they also had been waiting forever. The server said sorry and not to worry about it. I handed him my check and said \"thank you !! I'm so glad their drinks got taken care of for the wait but not mine.\" This place continues  to disappoint and I'll never make the mistake of coming back again",

The food was good, and an appropriate quantity, but the pancakes seemed slightly undercooked in spots, i.e., a little doughy, and I'd have appreciated a little more fruit on top. My over-medium eggs, on the other hand, were spot on. Overall, good enough that I am curious to return sometime and try some of the other items on the menu.",

I refused to eat because of reasons I'll give, but they insisted, so I was going to go along just for the ride. Upon walking up to the restaurant, I noticed the piece of s**t owner still parks his white Escalade in the Handicap parking spots. I told my friends no way we are going in there, I won't support a business with the owner who's a disrespectful piece of s**t, so we left to go somewhere else.   A few months back I was with someone who was handicapped who needed that spot. Unfortunately the piece of s**t owner was parked there and my 85 year old family member had to walk clear across the parking lot, right there he lost my business for good and I'll forever talk bad about this business.   Get some respect dude!!!",

He took our drink ordered right away and asked if had been here before and if we had any questions about the menu and gave us time to look over the menu. He let us know right away that portions were huge and enough to share. My son ordered a single stack deep fried french toast and made it a combo with over medium eggs & bacon. The french toast was nice and crispy on the outside and tasted good. It was topped with a big scoop of butter which was a little much. The eggs were cooked perfectly and bacon was thick and not too crispy. My daughter ordered the kid's grilled cheese lightly grilled with a side of french fries. The grilled cheese came out perfect - not too browned and not too light. She didn't like the fries and she asked me to try them and I wasn't a fan either. They were brown and soggy so they weren't eaten. She also ordered a side of sourdough toast which again was drenched in butter. Just had to scrape most of it off. But she was happy with her grilled cheese. I originally ordered a single stack peanut butter pancake with chocolate chips but our server said they ran out of chocolate chips. Boo. So I ordered my second choice which was a single stack lemon blueberry pancake with whipped cream cheese. It took awhile for my pancake to come but when it did it looked and smelled delicious. Again it was topped with a big scoop of butter which I set aside and used only what I needed. The pancake was very good and I liked that it was thick and fluffy once you cut into it. It wasn't too sweet and the blueberries were not so tart. The lemon flavor was perfect. I would order again and next time ask for a little more of the cream cheese topping. Overall we had a great breakfast. Service was excellent. Our server was attentive, always refilled our drinks and checked on us to make sure we were good. I knocked off one star for the french fries, running out of chocolate chips and for my pancake coming a little late. But will definitely come back!",

Of course no menu for me until I had to stop him and ask for it. Food took long time but I understand, however not once he stop by my table refill the coffee or ask check on me , even passed by me about 30 times.

    "text": "We used to love this place. It has great food, but it isn't well staffed or well managed. We used to go almost once a week and we're familiar with some of the staff there. They have a great menu, and the food is made well. However, the recent times we've been there over the past year has made it not worth going. The place is not managed well for the popularity of the place. You'd think they'd know how to handle all tables in use and a wait, but instead, the place is understaffed and frazzled. Today, for example, the person taking names at the door was obviously stressed out and ignored my husband waiting out front for at Leary 10 minutes, didn't take his name until I stepped in and said something.  After 10 minutes and the hostess seating a random family that walked up ahead of us, we were sat but not given a menu or silverware. They brought us coffee but nothing to stir cream or sugar with. I had to bum a menu off a person sitting at a table next to me and use the straw from my child's water to stir cream into my coffee. I asked if they have children's cups for my 22-month-old to have water, and instead of telling me no, they brought a huge, heavy glass jar, which was promptly spilled across the table. No staff noticed, but luckily we had backup outfits we could mop up the water with.   It took our server over half an hour to order our food (after I asked to do so) and another 20-30 minutes to get our food. The only thing they were prompt at was giving us a check after our food was delivered, but when trying to run our card, took forever to bring us our card back. They needed 2-3 more servers and a busser for sure. The staff also need more coaching about customer service. There are too many great options in town to waste my time waiting each step of the way at this place. I don't plan on going back again.",

The Elvis pancakes did not come with the bananas and I had to ask why and was told they don't have any good ones. There are 2 grocery stores in walking distance! Also my scrambled eggs were cold. We complained to the server who told us that he will relay the message over to the manager who avoided us at all cost. After asking for our bill 3 times we finally just paid and left.

In photos, it all looks so good. The dishes are set up to look very enticing. Especially that hot chocolate! But you're paying $5.99 for hot chocolate water. The whipped cream melts, and the enticing aesthetic is gone. I ordered the corned beef hash. It was dry, and very heavy on potatoes, which dominated the flavor. Every now and then you'll taste the occasional white onion, at best. I'm sad to say that I enjoy ihop's corned beef over this one, but the price I paid for it was equivalent to what I paid for Echo & Rig's fancy, flavorful equivalent (and even without the hollandaise sauce, it wasn't dry).  I kind of want to go back and try the pancakes or French toast, but no one else in my party enjoyed their food. I was told the chicken (from the chicken and waffles dish) was rubbery, which turned them off. The rest compared it to Denny's.  Pretty looking food does not mean quality. If it hadn't cost as much as a quality tasting meal, we wouldn't really complain. If it were more reasonably priced, I'd be more enticed to give it a shot again.  Staff was nice though.",

We were greeted by a woman who was at the register and instructed us to sit anyone we'd like. There were at least 6 tables open but almost every single one was dirty. We had no other option than to sit at an awkward table in the middle of the restaurant next to a big party. Two different people came to ask for our drink order and food order. Staff was not on the same page. Food was alright. Our omelettes were supposed to be served with toast, but we didn't get any toast. Never got refill on coffee. Apple juice was served in a tiny (probably 4 oz) mason jar. Restaurant was obviously under staffed. I will probably not dine here again. Definitely not worth the money we spent.",

    "text": "It's good-ish. I LOVE pancakes some would say obsessed with them and when I went hunting for a new place to feed my addiction I set my sights upon this magical place. Reading the reviews on yokes it gave off a meh appeal to anyone who hasn't been here but we went on a whim and went for it. We arrived around 1030 in the morning and the place had a medium level crowd and we were able to sit right away, from there our waitress took our drink orders and then dissappeared for the rest of the stay I think we were served by everyone on staff because at one point another server came by took our food orders and I believe the chef came by and dropped the food off as well as gave drink refills.   Food wise the selection is exciting, you can make your own pancake with a choice of making it a combo (eggs and bacon)  for around 10 bucks. I ordered mint batter with nutella on top because why not and went ham on it. The wait was around 20 minutes which is not as bad as the other ratings were and the wait was worth it because ooo man were these things huge. You can pretty much just order the cakes on their own and they would feed you for at least the rest of the day. The  eggs were good but the bacon was actually legit thick bacon, I am not talking about the regular thin wimpy  bacon I'm talking wow this actually came from a pig bacon that was actually crispy and not limp.( that's what she said) The cakes  were great, not dry or lacking in flavour just awesomness all around.   So, would I recommend? Yes I would, the food alone is great. The only thing that was annoying was the service as it took the owner actually coming over to deliver the food to get my coffe refilled. So if you want some monster cakes this is the place but if you want great food as well as better service maybe look elsewhere.",

We had breakfast this morning, and after about 15 minutes we were notified that they were out of what we ordered.  We change our order and it took another 20 minutes to get our food. We were there for almost 45 minutes before our meal got there.    To make things worse, when we got our Bill, they tried to charge us for the items they did not have. I wasn't surprised as this is about the fifth time we've been there and every single time we've been they mysteriously add items to our bill to charge us an additional $10-$20.  And because they didn't have the items we ordered I ordered two fried eggs and a side of bacon, they charge me six dollars for three slices of bacon and another five dollars for two Friday eggs, absolutely ridiculous.",

    "text": "This was my first time and quite possibly my last time to come here. Although there was many people waiting to be seated; our smiling hostess seated within 10 mins of arrival. This was probably the only positive. One employee took our drink order and almost immediately brought it. The utensils were dirty and thrown together on our table. Then, another employee, supposedly our waitress, took our order. I requested to have a high chair for my child and was never given it until I asked again. But that was when we finally received our food. Food presentation was unacceptable and the high chair was down right dirty. Throughout most of our meal we were never checked on. Also, I finished one cup of coffee and it was never filled again until I asked. The employee I asked looked at me and said she will get it in a few minutes. She then turned around and proceeded to set up silverware. It could've taken her 2 mins to turn around walk three steps to the coffee and fill but still she proceeded to set up her silverware. Another employee who was working another section is the only person who came over to ask if we needed anything. When I requested the coffee she immediately went to get it. But the other waitress came and filled my cup only half way.  Now it normally takes a lot for me to write a review, but I hope that this establishment improves. I can guarantee that I'm not the only one who had an unfortunate experience on Mother's Day. The table next to us asked for their toast more than three times and was told it'll take a minute and it'll be right out. They finished their meal and never received their toast until they asked for their check. I've worked in customer service for over 10 years and this was by far the worst service ever received.",

    "text": "Always wanted to checkout this breakfast spot not only cause its close to home. Breakfast food makes some of the best recovery meals for triathlete or getting your sweat on. The interior decor got admit made great first impression really like the modern look with the oversize part menu on one side, and almost jenga building block different colors and sizes on another wall. The main logo has lot of personality and think its cool. I like the open kitchen look and no shortage of tables all bunched together that for sure...  On to the good stuff FOOD. I might have ordered the wrong stuff that not the rave. The pancakes had some buzz so had to get one of those. I love pancakes of any flavor for recovery meal. I settled on the Red Velvet Pancakes. In general love pancakes but if see Red Velvet am all over it. I only got single stack since wanted too try more of the menu. Thankfully ordered single stack. Talk about huge pancake. I would almost venture on size just as big as one had at The Griddle Cafe. But unlike not only The Griddle Cafe but Babystacks. The pancakes here was ok at best even then being nice. I felt like the pancake was too dense, no fluff in them, not nice moist full pancake filling with every bite, and the raspberry sauce they put on top OVERKILL for me. I think those two flavors don't mix. Lets be honest good pancake should stand out by itself! It never worked for me.  Turkey Melt was another nothing really stood out for me. All the components was blah. The turkey meat nothing special just ordinary deli slices, the cheese, and the chili. I did like the bread and the fact cooked it right. The sandwich had nice golden crust and the inside filling was hot with all cheese melted spilling out with every bite. The fries that came with it was another blah. The seasoning on them not figure out was not very good.   The service was spot on five stars. It more like 3.5 star. The service needs shout out. They were friendly from time walked in, never had empty glass, and explained any questions had since first time perfect.   Sracks and Yolks is place that will come back try again. It just might have been ordered the wrong stuff off the menu. lol.",

WHAT!? He completely lied to me because they close at 3:00p.  Food was would have been great if they only focused on the order placed.

    "text": "Wow. I don't know what happened here, but this place will never see my business again. The owner is a POS.   We have come here many times, and everything was always perfect. Today we came and we noticed right off the bat the place was half empty, and there was still a 10 minute wait. People were visibly upset outside, having waited forever for their bills. But we still sat. Bad idea.   Firstly there were three tables that were seated after we ordered that received their food before we did. Then half of my husbands order didn't show. Or so we thought. Turns out I had my husbands food, and when I took a bite I nearly died because jalapeno and I don't mix and it was not regular bacon like I had ordered.   Finally the waitress came by and when I said I didn't have my food, and there was a mix up, she didn't know what to do. She immediately put the blame on the kitchen, which ok. But then she made no effort to even get my food.   Then my husbands pancake, and my daughters were mixed up. Like, this isn't hard. One has sprinkles baked into it and the other doesn't.   So now we finally ask for the manager because honestly, this is unacceptable. There isn't even a manager, but the owner happened to be there. The man had the nerve to walk out of his own restaurant with a kid and a bunch of to go bags. Couldn't be bothered to even apologize for the mix up or anything.   And the topping is he told the waitress to give us 20% off MY FOOD THAT I DIDNT EVEN HAVE. Not the bill, my non existent food.   So yeah. Fuck this guy and fuck this place. Never getting my business again since he fired his whole staff that knew what they were doing to probably save his cheap ass a couple of bucks.",

My fella ordered the eggs benedict.  Service was friendly and attentive. They were on the slower side because they were so busy, but when our food did eventually come out it was delicious. The home fries and the lemon blueberry pancakes were my favorites. The pancakes are probably some of my favorite that I've tried in vegas, perfectly cooked, the blueberries were flavorful and ripe and the hint of lemon complemented the flavors perfectly.

I got the orange cranberry pancakes with whipped cream cheese and whipped cream at the suggestion of Rudy. Boy, was he on the money.

We called ahead to give them a heads up that our party of 14 was arriving around 10:30am. My brother and I checked in at 10am to put our name down. They did inform us it'll be a while but they had saved tables for us in the back waiting for more tables to clear. Our party had been waiting for quite some time and we noticed the tables had opened up.  After a while when we checked to see if it was ready the host told us she gave away our tables and it'll be another 30 minutes. We were tired of waiting so 11:40am comes around and we mentioned to just sit us separately. The host went in to see what tables were open and never came back out. We sat ourselves on open tables. Being a server I wouldn't appreciate my guests sitting themselves out of rotation especially when I'm not ready for another table but after an hour and forty minutes we had to take matters into our own hands. We started noticing other parties that checked in after us and not waiting long sitting at our tables. We understand it's a small location but we called ahead so the restaurant can be prepared so we could have avoided this problem. What was suppose to be our last family meal before our relatives had to leave we ended up sitting away from each other like strangers. They are other breakfast spots with food just as good and more capacity, leaving stacks and yolks often not worth the hassle.",

We see a good amount of people waiting thinking \"ohhh, this is going to be good. Let's see the wait.\" The hostess says about 15-20 minutes. Awesome! 30 minutes later we are walked to our table. Coffee was delivered and food orders were taken. One person in our party asked about \"specials\" which we later understood are just overpriced items... The opposite of a special. Anyway, food took an hour to come out. Portuguese sausage taste like tire. Eggs were over cooked. Potatoes undercooked, some black. Pancakes were decent. Not worth the wait :/",

We went late on a Sunday morning. It was packed and we waited for almost an hr to be seated inside after being told there was only a 20 min wait to begin with. I can deal with that. Here's what I can't understand, sitting for 20 mins without having a single waiter come over for food orders or even drinks. I had to go back to the hostess and ask her if we had a waiter assigned. 5 tables that came in after us were served and got their food before us! I was told by the waitress that finally came over that our waiter got backed up and that's why he didn't come over so she was now helping us without any apologies. I dislike this place very much, food was okay, nothing special not worth the wait or stress. I was charged incorrectly in the end too. I will never come back and tell everyone I know to skip this place, it's horrible...should have went up the street to island flavor instead!",

The server politely asked if everything was okay for the second time and I told her and showed her it was watery and that I would rather just not eat it. She didnt eveb suggest to remove it from the bill and at one point she just laughed and said sorry you had a bad experience I guess we made made a bad first impression. Due to this, I will not be returning to this restaurant.",

I order a corned beef hash and I think the cook loaded it with salt . It's horrible and when I told the server he said that he will give me discount or wait for another one. But when the bill came no discount at all. Don't eat there , horrible place .",

Listen, I am not putting blame on the little girl who moved us I am putting it on the person in charge that made her do it.  You saw us when we walked up, my 75 year old father struggling with me holding him to just walk, you saw how long it took us to get into the restaurant, you seated us and you watched as I had to put him in his chair, take off his jaket and pull him in close to the table.  You watched us order coffee, we sat there for a good 10 minutes long enough to get OJ and Water, and order food.  15 minuets we sat there and then you come and tell us we have to move because you have to get ready for a 12 top.  Get out of here.  I refused and said no.....you gave me no option, my mother who hates arguments just said move, Shame on you.  Now I have to move my 75 year old feeble father with Parkinsons disease.  Not easy, had to move the table then grab him and stand him up while the rest of the people stare.  It's hard enough on him then to have to embarrass him like that.    I won't be back to your establishment, this was just ridiculous and un needed.  I am ashamed of you.  You should all be ashamed of yourself.",

I would recommend it to anybody.  I first started coming to stacks and yolks when I moved to this side of town. Not too many people knew about it because every time I went in there wasn't many people there. Now everytime I go there's lots of people with a great crowd. However there still no wait time for a table which i think is amazing for the quality of staff and food.   I usually get the meat lovers scramble but since they've changed their menu, there so many great options now. I'll keep going back anytime. I also love how they have their stacks and yolks challenge. Which is to eat 10 pancakes and 10 eggs in one hour for a free meal and free t-shirt. If you can't do it you owe them $40.",

The hostess was super friendly and accommodating. When we sat down we were seated right in the busy walk way where our drinks were almost knocked over on several occasions. Our waitress didn't even show up to our table for about 10 minutes and when she did she was rude. She brought out our drinks and never came back. When our food came out, our eggs were cold and our pancakes were dry. It took another 15 minutes to flag down our waitress for the check. Overall, I would not recommend. Food was mediocre and service was terrible. Only gave this place 1 star for the nice hostess and the hot chocolate.",

I ordered the corn beef hash; they marinate it in Ale and add peppers and onions for extra flavor. The breakfast was $13.99 and it came with home fries, 3 eggs, and biscuits and gravy. Yes, my meal was almost $14, but they do give you a lot of food for your money.   All in all, the staff was friendly and the food was good. The home fries tasted like potatoes, and I mean that as in they need more salt or pepper, or any seasoning for that matter.   So, why the 3 stars and not a hire rating? This place is good, not great. I love the mom and pop atmosphere, and like I said, the staff was friendly. The highlight of my dish was the corn beef hash, but everything else couldn't hold a candle to the main attraction. The potatoes were  bland, the eggs were good, the biscuits and gravy needed more seasoning.   Will I return? Sure, the next time I need an oil change. Like I said, it was good... Just not great.",

It's not their fault they have nothing to do, but the owner should cut labor and save himself a little money.  Secondly, the food was not seasoned at all. I am not sure why but our home fries had no salt at all and were only partially cooked.  Lastly, over 30 dollars for two people to eat breakfast is pretty steep.

Ihop or dennys is a healthier option than this place.. if you do eat here you'll notice how greasy everything is.. they use butter for everything..so if you're a vegan lol well you won't be a vegan for one meal.  If you want a real breakfast place, one that won't make you want to take a nap right away, go to egg works or the cracked egg.. they are close and much better.  ALSO, The OWNER.. wow what a piece of work, he's rude, inattentive and had a GUN out on the counter showing his coworkers when i came in... obviously not a family friendly restaurant.,,UNPROFESSIONAL",

When we arrived we realized it was same owner different name, we decided to try it anyways.   We were seated quickly even though there was a line, which was nice. The server was friendly and took our drink and food orders quickly also.   This is were stacks and yolks starts to lose points. It took 30 minutes for our food to come out. Even the server told us he didn't know why it was taking so long.   When food finally arrived I thought it was going to be the best tasting breakfast because it took so long. Sadly I was wrong.   I ordered a breakfast burrito, which was very plain. There was no seasoning on any of it. The onions and bell peppers were diced so large and weren't fully cooked. It had the hard crunchy taste and flavor. The potatoes were semi warm and soggy. Would've been better if fried a little longer.   My wife ordered a sausage Benedict. The bagel was plain, the sausage was basic and the egg was over cooked. The only good thing was the hollandaise sauce. She ordered a fruit bowl instead of potatoes and even that wasn't good.   Overall the food is what I expected at Denny's. I definitely won't go back again. There are better options such as cracked egg and egg works.",

When i got there they told me to go to the register to place my order and it took quite a bit of time for anyone to even acknowledge me. The guy workers there look like they hate their life and they would rather be somewhere else. Someone did finally took notice of me and she was extremely nice and took my order. Once I got my order I headed home and to find my order of pancakes were completely wrong and to find my chicken fried steak was so small. I know it was bit my fault I didnt check the order before I left. I assumed that the order was simple enough. I did try to call them again to let them know in a chance they could start creating the correct set of pancakes for my daughter and have it ready when I arrived. Again no answer so I didn't attempt to even go back. I just wont be back. If you are looking for breakfast just drive down or order from IHOP. Their food is 100x better I would say.",

I couldn't remember much about the food so my boyfriend and I decided to come back and give it another go.   Our second visit was much worse. We agreed to sitting outside since the restaurant was relatively busy but received the worst service. Our waitress never came to check on us and we received zero refills on our coffee after asking the staff member who delivered our food (which also came out close to 45 minutes after we placed our order) and also attempting to wave down our waitress. She came by to drop off our check and left immediately after before we could say a single word and never came to pick up our bill.  Eager to leave and disappointed at the extremely poor service, we went inside and asked another staff member to run our check. I try to be lenient when places are busy or if perhaps our waiter/waitress is having a bad day but this was one of our worst experiences at a restaurant. Though the food was decent, we won't be returning here again.",

Not very practical. Tried the corned beef and hash breakfast with a side of biscuits topped with gravy. Also tried the eggs, bacon, and lemon pancakes breakfast. Corned beef and hash was dull and boring. Completely void of flavor just like the potatoes. Hot sauce to the rescue! Biscuits and gravy was pleasantly good. Put gravy on anything and it is usually great. The lemon pancakes had good flavor and was also pleasant. Friendly and helpful customer service. Got to try something different next time. Tried the Hobo Skillet and it was delicious. Still used hot sauce, but it had its own good flavors.",

Now that I've found it, this is an every Monday AM spot with friends. The owner greets you with a smile, and that welcome  feeling you only get from a \"locals\" spot. He knows us when we walk in, as does the staff. Nothing beats that feeling of being comfortable and at home.   The food and coffee are spot on, and the OJ is killer. The girl who put down the gluten free stuff, needs to check herself. They have two kinds, one of which is Paleo friendly, which a big deal to a Paleo girl like myself. The almond meal batter allows me to savor a pancake, without risking major back lash from my body for eating a rice flour version of GF. I look forward to my Paleo pancake every single week! My friends who is GF prefers the other type, which they happily make for her. The griddle platter or the Portuguese (linguisa) sausage and eggs are what I get on the regular with my epic pancake. The syrup is hot, the coffee is smooth, they actually have tapatio for my eggs, and the food is something we all crave in our group that show up every single Monday. The owners truly care about the place, and it is clean every time I've been there. I honestly have nothing bad to say about Stacks & Yolks.   If you haven't tried this place, you're missing out. I bring everyone here for a perfect breakfast, every single time. My clients even cruise over for breakfast after their weekend riding lessons!!   See you Monday morning!",

Shortly after, the busser asked us what we would like to drink and promptly gave us our drinks.  Waitress asked to take our orders right after.  Then it goes downhill...Once our orders are in, we are waiting 25-35 minutes for our food.  The busser/waitress checked on us and our drinks once during the time.  FInally our food arrives.  I got the corned beef hash, everything is burnt, it was mediocre at best, my over-easy eggs were under cooked  (I did not complain or send it back.) My boyfriend got the western skillet,  he liked it, but the entire bottom portions of food were burnt...yes, it is a skillet; however, there are proper ways to prepare skillet meals, where the bottom does not end up burnt.  No one checked on us the entire time we were eating.  Our drinks were completely empty our entire meal.  My boyfriend saw the busser pass behind me, stare directly at my empty glass, and went about her business, without checking on us.  When our bill came, my boyfriend told the person we needed our drinks refilled and that no one checked on us the entire time we ate...The busser overheard this and gave my boyfriend the evil eye...The ice tea was out now, the ice machine wasn't working.  No refill for me, my boyfriend got the water he requested.  This place is a mess.  It was a fairly busy day.  However, they had two hosts, plenty of bussers, waiters/waitresses, and kitchen staff.  It should not take that long for breakfast food to come out.  Food was mediocre, service was horrible.  Bill was $34 (not including tip) for two people, which would have been okay, if the food was excellent and the service was good.  The alignment of the tables made it difficult to walk out, and all I wanted to do was run out of this place fast!  Will never come back to this place.  One star, because even if the start was ok, how dare an employee give an evil eye or glare to a customer.",

All seems really good...but we wanted something quick and easy.  We always passed by The Griddle, but never got a chance to eat there till last week.    They have a seating for outside and a decent size inside.  The two individuals that gave us drinks and refilled them were really nice.  I ordered the red velvet pancakes and my husband got the griddle platter.  He loved it; and mentioned it was not greasy at all.  I also loved my red velvet pancakes...they were really moist.  I liked how it had powered sugar and chocolate syrup.  I wished I was able to just used the chocolate syrup instead of the pancake syrup.  It took some time to get our bill.  I guess because there was only 1 server.  I believe he was the owner?  He took the orders, caculated the bill and took the payments.  He probably needed 2 servers to get that place to turnover people really quick.  There was a line at one point to get people seated and to pay for their checks.  Overall, it was a good place, and we will return.",

I heard that the red velvet batter was the number one seller so I tried that along with the fried chicken wings. I hated the red velvet waffle mainly because it didn't taste like red velvet whatsoever. The sauce in which they used on top tasted like artificial cherry syrup!!!!! Yucky. Horrible aftertaste. Then the fried chicken were 4 little scrawny pieces either the flat part or drumstick. And the chicken and waffle meal was 11 bucks. Totally not worth it! They have other options for chicken so you can get grilled or fried chicken tenders, wings, or breast. Needless to say I was still hungry after that, and highly disappointed. Guess I will stick to \"the cafe\" chicken and waffles inside of the Monte Carlo.",

We live in the area and try to give our business to places nearby but this just was not good.  A little clean up is also in order.",

The batters come in hot cakes as well as waffle form. My absolute favorite is their pumpkin pancake with cream cheese topping....it's a foodgasm! Also, their marinated steak tips are apparently marinated in \"unicorn tears\" lol. The corn beef hash is homemade and savory. It's a great place to go with pals and or family.",

I ordered a short stack of red velvet pancakes with strawberries and my husband ordered the breakfast burrito.  We got our food fast. The red velvet pancakes were really fluffy and delicious.  My husband's burrito were just ok, nothing really special about it.  While we were eating it got busier.   The reason why I'm giving them a 3.5 stars was for the time we waited for our check to come after I asked for it.  I saw customers  that were getting a little miffed while waiting for their food.  I still want to patronize them because they are not a chain.",

We arrived around 1130 am and the place was full but not packed.  We seated ourselves and were promptly waited on.  My husband got the fried chicken and vanilla waffle and thought it was MUCH better than Hash House.  He said the fried chicken was the best he'd had on the west coast (he's a southern gentleman).  He likes the chicken to shine through and not be overwhelmed by seasoning and he thought that The Griddle nailed their fried chicken.  I did take a bite of his waffle and it was literally the best waffle I've ever had.  Now, i'm not a waffle expert or anything...but it was light and deeeelish!  I ordered the french toast combo and again, I was super pleased with the taste.  The french toast was thick and had a hint of cinnamon.  I ordered my eggs over-medium and they were cooked to perfection!  The bacon was done nicely, crispy but not charred.  My daughter had the kids smiley face pancake and it was ENORMOUS.  We ended up taking 3/4 of it home.   The orange juice was freshly squeezed and very tasty and the coffee was good for diner coffee.  All in all, we were extremely glad that this place caught our eye.  We will be back for sure!",

I called on Sunday at 9am and was told the owner would call me back to place the order. At 6pm, I hadn't heard from him so I called again. At 7:40pm, he called me and we got the order placed. It was set for a 9am serve time which meant they would arrive at 8:45am. At 9:15, I called because they hadn't arrived. The girl who answered the phone, Mariah, said he already left 20 mins ago. Well, he left AFTER he was already supposed to be at my work, so that makes no sense. At 9:40, he still wasn't there!!! I called and Mariah told me he was lost. Great, was anyone going to communicate that with me? Oh, not to mention, I called the owner twice and asked both of his employees to have him call me and its 8:15pm right now and still no call. So they missed my meeting, the food was cold, the eggs had shells in them and were a greenish gray from sitting too long, and the bacon had hair in it. How do you mess up customer service when all you have to do is deliver it?! Never again!!!",

We recently tried Stacks and Yolks on Warm Springs and Durango and it was so-so. Very busy in there! About 10-15 to sit down but the tables are SO CLOSE TOGETHER that you can barely move (my purse got knocked off my chair several times). The servers definitely have a hard time moving around in there. We enjoyed the large portions - pretty awesome! The Strawberry Pancakes, sausage patties and eggs are good. I don't feel like it was anything to boast about but good.   Ps. I don't get why everywhere we go with \"Best of Las Vegas\" on the window makes us excited but when we try the place, we think... but why?? Hmm.",

Ben, my husband, had the special which was a Carne Asada skillet and I had the lemon blueberry pancakes.  I tried Ben's meal and it was delicious.

They do not use gloves I watched two of the servers make toast they spread the butter and hold the toast in the other hand one server wiped his nose a few times also went to open the door to go outside to serve the customer out side come back in and pick up an order of bacon that was sitting on the counter for a very long time not to mention pieces of the bacon was hanging off the plate on to the counter where they collect money not to mention what activities has been done before making the toast. They are not great at multi-tasking and the customer service needs work.

The first problem was that all of the food came to us cold. Next, the \"should have been scrambled\" eggs came to me over easy. The pancakes were not what I expected and personally did not like them. Then the other eggs that were cold took more than 10 minutes to come back but this time they came scrambled with cheese on top. We were very disappointed to say these least. Then when we got the bill, the amounts were wrong and no bill adjustment whatsoever for all of the numerous problems with the meal.",

The person who we assume was the manager on duty, was unapologetic and less than pleasant to his waitstaff. While we were seated quickly, we waited quite a while for our order to be taken. Once it was, it was around 45 more minutes whilst we waited for our food (we're talking pancakes here). In that time, we had five different servers, did not receive the water we requested until the third time, and were notified about 40 minutes in that what our daughter ordered was not available today (not that they just ran out, but our first server neglected to tell us). Finally, we were all served, and it was delicious. However, while we did not ask for a comp, some sort of gesture would have been nice. When we went to pay, we overheard our server approaching the person we assumed was the manager to ask to provide an orange juice to another family that had similar waiting issues. He indicated, \"No, we don't do comps...they have to pay if they want anything,\" then told her to go check on her tables in a dismissive way. I think we found the problem. Great food, but one can get great food many places that somehow manage to treat their customers and teams well. That was not demonstrated on this particular Wednesday morning. Sigh...",

Somehow we got a seat without waiting, which was nice! However if you have a party greater than 2 then I would expect to wait for seats. The menu seems roughly the same as before, with a bunch of customizable pancakes, waffles and egg scrambles available. I had the Chorizo scramble and the french waffles with buffalo wings. The interior is new and doesn't have that 'grandma' feel like in some breakfast restaurants.  It took a good 30 minutes for the food to come out but it was a full house. Fortunately the wait was well worth it. The portions are pretty big and we ordered just enough to feed two people. The price is more than fair at around $10 bucks a plate. Service is excellent and friendly.  I think this is a solid choice for breakfast or lunch. I recommend the red relvet pancakes or the french waffles with buffalo wings. Will definitely visit again!",

My waffle was the biggest disappointment ever.  It was rubbery, and had no fluff to it, it actually seemed like they just took pancake mix and attempted to make a waffle out of it.  It wasn't crispy at all, and not because it was in a take out container, we live maybe 2mins from the establishment, it was never crispy to begin with.  On top of it just being poor in taste and texture it looked horrible, burnt edges and they didn't even bother to clean off the over spill edges which is that parts that were burnt.   It tasted like they hadn't cleaned the waffle iron in some time.  There was s distinct taste of charred waffles that had been their before.  This was my first experience here and my absolute last.",

I'm glad boyfriend and I decided to stop in and give it a try. When we went, it was closer to closing and there were not many people in there. The food arrived very quickly after we ordered and the staff was very attentive.   Here's what we tried:   Goblet skillet - Turkey Sausage, Spinach, Roasted Red Pepper over Home Fries with Cheese. Not the deep fried kind, but the delicious kind fried atop a commercial flat-top stove. The skillet came with a side of your choice of 1 biscuit and gravy or toast. Of course, I went with the biscuit and gravy. The skillet came in a hearty portion that I was unable to finish.   Griddle platter - Chicken, Spinach, Mushroom and Feta Cheese over Home Fries with 3 Eggs any style. Served with Pita Bread. This was also a scrumptious meal served in a large portion. Just the right amount of feta cheese rounded out the flavors. I liked the goblet skillet way better.   Now, it took me a long time to figure out what I wanted because everything on the menu looked so good. Next time, I'm going to try the marinated steak tips because, as the menu says, it is \"marinated 18 hrs in Unicorn tears, served with 3 Eggs, Home Fries, Biscuit & Gravy.\" UNICORN TEARS.   Sold.",

Seating is awkward. They have seating right next to the door. Lucky for us we visited on a windy day and the only table available was right next to the door. With this highly coveted table, we were able to enjoy the benefits of a cold gust of wind every time the door opened. We also were able to enjoy a hot coffee when we were first seated AND a cold coffee after a few patrons arrived or departed. As other Yelpers have stated, service was a bit slow so refills to try to keep the coffee at least warm were almost non existent. Tip to the servers: Everyone should have a responsibility in keeping all customers happy. If you see a table that is not assigned to you with a near empty coffee cup and you are bringing coffee for your assigned table, why not just do a quick fill up as you pass by the table that is not yours? It is really a courtesy to the customer more that your coworker.  The pancake options are cool but if you don't have a good base, what you build on it seems to just try to disguise the fact that the base is lacking in flavor and texture.  We won't be going back to this location.",

I'm a sucker for good, fluffy pancakes and all the different flavors/options they have are great. Have never been disappointed when eating here. My only complaint is how tiny the restaurant is especially since it's normally always crowded. I avoid getting an aisle table if possible just because I feel crammed when I do.",

The first time I ordered the Griddle which is 3 eggs the way you like chicken feta spinach and mushrooms on top of home fries...oh and some pita bread on the side. Wow!!! Not your ordinary breakfast and oh so delicious. I get this quiet often because of how much I love it. There is also the option of getting it on a griddle instead and you get the option of getting toast or biscuit and gravy.   So let's talk about the gravy!!! Holy crap it brought me back to when I was younger. I have never in my 27 years been able to find another gravy like the one I used to eat as a child so this gravy hit the spot.  I have tried the Arizona, French toast, chicken pesto sandwich, chorizo and eggs with peppers, Egg's Florentine, and a few other things and I have never once been let down! It gets busy and full at times but the staff is ALWAYS great and we are seated promptly. Great place, great food, great staff!!",

And the food takes so long to come out.  It is good don't get me wrong but If you're in a hurry don't go here for breakfast. The owner isn't as friendly.. Used to walk table to table and ask how things are.. Now he parks right in the front (I get u have a nice car, but customers should come first) comes in for a few minutes then stands out front to smoke (seriously right in front of the restaurant and there was a child eating outside) before leaving.. Guess that's what happens when you make money. Sad",

Getting served bad coffee in dirty coffee mugs and having to ask to be served coffee as opposed to being asked if i would like more coffee on a constant basis is not my idea of good service. Food presentation and taste was good aside from the large egg shell in my Californian Eggs Benedict. It did get it replaced along with a small apology and an unprofessional explanation of how the server reprimanded the cook, in my opinion not necessary to let me know. Spending a bit over $50 on breakfast for 3 people is not worth the visit.",

Reminds me of a little bit more expensive baby stacks cafe (has list of flavor pancakes) and other unique items!   Food is incredible! Got to eat the spinach and turkey Benedict. Also the veggie skillet, and churro waffle (obsessed) their hot cocoa is amazing because of the whip cream part, otherwise it's your original dry packet and water in a cup cause I sure tasted 95% water.  There is inside and outside seating which is awkward because it's in a small strip mall. You're basically on a covered sidewalk. Service kinda sucks only if outside. Very reasonable prices and their hours and staff make this place outstanding. Also love their interior!!!!",

When we moved to the southwest part of town, we took a shot on the place we had heard about a couple times. My fiance and I were lucky enough to have the same days off at the time so it became a weekly tradition. While she has stuck to the pancakes for the most part, I have tried to work my way around the menu. I'm a sucker for their skillets though and can't seem to get past them. The hobo being my favorite, I haven't been disappointed with any of them. The steak tips marinated in unicorn tears is also a crowd pleaser.  They run some specials you can find on the whiteboard and I have never been disappointed with those either. The orange juice I believe is fresh pressed.  They ran a fundraiser not to long ago to support some fallen police  officers. The turn out was amazing and it was awesome to seem them do that.  The staff are always friendly and have gotten to know us over time. Just a great all around spot.",

Especially since we called our order in and they forgot to put part of our orders in the bag. Drove home to our hungry out of town guests, but had to drive back to get the rest of our orders.   Luckily for us, we had leftovers in the  fridge and the kids ate that, because they didn't enjoy their food. Honestly the things we ordered, we can whip up at home and I wish we did. Sad to say my pops left on his last day of vacay here in VEGAS having had this terrible breakfast.   The red velvet pancake was far from yummy and we also had the philly skillet, which also wasn't great either and the great gobbler tasted like any meal you could throw together yourself at home. If we weren't pressed for time, we would have just made breakfast in our own. When your toddler doesn't even want to eat the meals, what does that say to you? In total we ordered 6 different dishes and not one of them wowed us. Not too sure we even want to come back to try anything else, especially when 6 out of 6 dishes we ordered today didn't wow us.",

The floor was filthy dirty with food all over the place. Where was the bus boy to have cleaned this up?  I ordered a freshly squeeze orange juice and it tasted as if they mixed molded orange with it. I exchanged it for an Arnold Palmer which was not that great. I tried the special marinated steak with eggs. The meat was so salty and rubbery; the eggs nothing special, home fries were cold and tasted almost like a frozen product. I asked for them to put some more heat on them and make them well done. Also my sour dough toast was so lightly toasted that it was also disappointing.  My girlfriend's son had the waffle and he did not like it all. She mentioned it was gooey and not properly cooked. She also asked for her potatoes to be made crispier. We also tried the Red Velvet pancake and that as well had a strange texture. It was gummy like the batter was over mix. Maybe my expectations were too high? Or maybe we came to close to the closing time that the staff just wanted out!  The owner mentioned that they had no affiliation with the West Hollywood Griddles. Pity cause the California one was so much better!",

    "text": "I had all the hope in the world for this cute restaurant.  I originally came here for the first time with a friend about two months ago. The service was terrible (the way of being seated, our waitress, and not getting our bill and check back after we paid) but the food was stellar (french toast, sausage, and cheesy scrambled eggs). Since the food was stellar, I decided to give this cute breakfast place another chance. What a mistake. The way of being seated, which consists of waiting outside where there is no greeter, but instead a waiter or waitress who happens to be outside, makes no sense to me. Thank goodness a waiter happened to be outside or we would've been standing out on a humid day for awhile. The restaurant was practically empty. We chose one of the two booths in the back of the restaurant, which was freezing compared to the rest of the restaurant. I ordered a hot tea, and my cup still had a ring of coffee or tea from the last person who drank from the cup.. Absolutely repulsive. The waitress nonchalantly gave me another cup as if the fact the cup was dirty wasn't that big of a deal. I ordered the french toast again that I had last time, while my friend ordered chicken fingers. My friend said her chicken tenders tasted rubbery and she wasn't even sure if it was chicken. My french toast wasn't close to the quality it was the first time I visited this restaurant.   I gave this restaurant that has rave reviews on Yelp two chances and was unsatisfied both times, I definitely won't be back for lucky number three. I'll go to SkinnyFats instead.",

They were packed when we arrived, we waited about 5 minutes for a table, as soon as seated we we're greeted by a sweet older gal that took our drink order. Just after that our server came, she intoduced herself (Erika) she was very attentive, with huge personality. I ordered pancakes and eggs, the pancakes were fluffy and delicious. My husband, who is very hard to please, ordered the special Country Fried Steak Skillet as that's what our server recommended. We got our food quickly, especially for how busy it was. My husband  absolutely loved his meal so much so he took the leftovers home & he doesn't do leftovers. I in fact have never left a review on yelp, or even had an account, I just felt I had to spread the word on this place. Fantastic food, phenomenal service, good prices and large portions. We'll be back next weekend!",

The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is because the coffee is a little darker tasting (bitter) than I prefer and they use breakfast potatoes instead of hash-browns.

Walking in, the establishment is small, but clean. Sadly, the air is heavy with the smell of grease. I was there for only an hour and my hair and clothes stink like it now. There was a huge lip smudge on husband's glass. Looked like the cup had not been washed at all.  We ordered french toast, biscuits and gravy, and some sort of chicken, mushroom, potato, and feta saute that came with eggs and pita. The French toast was less than thrilling. Stereotypical Texas toast with hardly any egg even coating the outside of it, and was very dry. It came drowned in cinnamon and powdered sugar. I hate powdered sugar. There was so much I wondered what they had to hide under it. Also, the French toast had been carelessly cooked over what looked like drops of someone else's red velvet pancake batter.  The biscuits were from a mix. Hard and dry like a desert.  The gravy was from a mix and hadn't even been made properly to hide the fact. It had no flavor beyond flour and msg. The sauteed thing was burned in many places. Spinach over cooked, mushrooms rubbery, and the chicken pieces were smaller than a dime. The chicken tasted like it came preseasoned from a package  and didn't match the seasoning from the rest of the dish. Pita bread was over cooked on one side and doughy on the other.  I love supporting small businesses, but this place was such a let down with the food and greasy smell that I honestly don't plan to even try it a second time. However, I wish the employees only good things because they were very good people.",

They were the size of a human head, and weighed as much as one.  They were so dense and gross, I took one bite, and spit them out.  I make GF pancakes at home, using BIsquick GF mix which are actually lighter and fluffier than \"regular pancakes\"....I do not know what these people are using for a GF MIX, but they need to change it ASAP.  they were absolutely repugnant.

The food tasted ok the portions were about average and the price was consistent about $8-10 an omelette. When the bill came out and the bill was put together we carefully added it up and noticed there was an additional cost of $8  added to the bill for drinks that we did not have. We spoke to the manager who was very nice added up the bill and determine we were owed 8 dollars. Overall ok food, ok price, sub par service and glad we caught the overcharge.",

They were out of all their juices even we came in. My pancakes were super burnt. The tables are unnecessarily close to each other. Im absolutely blown away that there's no changing tables in the restrooms. Rude. Just rude. The bathrooms were comparable to that of a truck stop. Filthy floors, out of TP, over flowing trash can. They also didn't offer my 3 year old a kids menu or crayons. Again, this definitely is not a place for kids. Won't be returning anytime soon. We'll stick to other breakfast spots.",

    "text": "Solid breakfast spot in the Southwest part of Las Vegas. This place can get busy depending on the time of day but I see it being very busy that hour just after breakfast and just before lunch.    I had to try one of their skillets on this visit.  I was torn between the \"Great Gobbler\" and the \"Philly\".  Both ingredient combinations looked appetizing as did the others.  I decided on the \"Philly\" with thin steak grilled peppers and onions with provolone cheese melted over a king size bed of thick cut american fries and topped with 3 eggs over easy.  Wow! the portions are huge.  I couldn't believe they were topping these skillets with 3 eggs  while most places give 2. The iron skillet came out sizzling hot like the sound of fajitas at a Mexican joint.  Also the huge amount of potatoes underneath all the toppings will definitely be a challenge to finish.  I think they should cut the potatoes a little smaller to cook a little more evenly and crunchier but they were still awesome.  This was an excellent dish.  My friend chose the \"Gobbler and he said it was delicious and filling as well.  Another in the group had the traditional eggs benedict and that was also demolished.    Overall visit was good, food was made with quality ingredients and the portions were very filling and prices reasonable.  I cannot wait to go back however this location is pretty far from my home and will have to be a destination location.  Stacks and Yolks does have a location closer to me in the north on Jones Blvd so I might have to do a comparison between the two.  This restaurants claim to fame is its pancakes claiming over 10 different batters.  So if you like to start your day with sweets you might fancy this concept.  I enjoy more of a savory dish to start my day which are also very good here.    Enjoy!",

The owner had his entire tribe of screaming children running around the entire restaurant disrupting paying customers. We had two orders of the Mexican huevos- the steak was ice cold. We skillet came out piping hot, but wasn't made as it was listed on the menu. No feta cheese. My sour dough toast looked like toasted rye bread.   We made our complaints to the waiter and he went to speak with the manager, came back, three us the tab and said \"I got you 20% off but that's all I can\", as if we wanted something for free.. we just wanted our food to be offered to be heated at the very least and maybe fresh toast?   I'm not one to post reviews I was just literally THAT bothered by it. When I paid the tab the OWNER said- \"sorry about that\". Nothing further. DO NOT GO THERE AND WASTE YOUR MONEY.",

However, it was a quick, empty breakfast spot to get a carnivorous breakfast dish for my husband while I grabbed JuiceBox next door. My husband really liked what he ordered, so we ended up coming back again with my Dad one day for brunch.  I tried their Garden Skillet, which is basically a veggie + cheese + egg (I ordered sans egg) skillet over potatoes. I wouldn't say it was \"bad\", but there's an unbeatable version of this skillet that I was accustomed to ordering at another restaurant back when I lived in the South Bay Area, California. This, compared to that, was like eating a mash of bland baby food. It was edible, but the flavor and care I was familiarized with just wasn't in this dish.  That said, they have a Unicorn pancake menu item here that I'm a little curious about. Not sure if I ever will try it, but due to the convenient location, I might.",

After they could not get our order right my friend was so annoyed he just got up and left. I too was annoyed & just paid the bill and wanted to get out of there. It wasn't until I got home that I noticed they way over charged us. They charged us a full hot chocolate when my friend asked for a little in his coffee.

In my view, we didn't receive 50% of our meal and to basically credit me the sales tax is unacceptable.  I won't be returning....ever. The only reason that I gave them 2 stars is because the food that we were served was pretty good.",

I also wasn't impressed with the food. I ordered the Meat Lovers Scramble and it was really bland. There was no flavor to the meats and the dish just lack seasoning. Same thing for the gravy. The rest of the dishes at our table ranged from ok to good.",

    "text": "Let me start off the review with THE SERVICE HERE SUCKS. I was super excited to come here because of Instagram pics. And I was not impressed by the waitresses here. First of all I ordered the churro French toast with Nutella and strawberries with a piece of fried chicken. And my friend got the churro waffle with strawberries. We waited ONE HOUR for our food. And I saw people coming and going and getting their food before us. I asked the waitress to check on our food (she was the one with the long pony tail) she didn't even check back with me to tell me how long it would be. The other waitress with the red hair was a little better. After the hour and we got our food I still didn't even get the fried chicken I ordered. The French toast was a little too sweet for my liking. My friends waffle had burnt pieces inside and she was picking them out while she was eating it. And then I checked on the fried chicken and they said oh the cook thought it said chicken wings. This was already a hour and a half of being there. I completely finished my meal and then they bring out a grilled chicken piece which was not what I ordered! I was very upset and disappointed. I'll be telling all my friends not to eat here. Wish I could give it no stars. I'm not even blessing them with my food pics that I took.",

No check back till the end, & no refills. The server that cleared my plate,  also cleared my 1/3 full water glass.  I may give it another chance at some point. I have been making it a point to hit different breakfast spots in the Southwest, I will say there is a lot of competition with better service.",

Now on to the food...and before I start I do admit I went in with a biased opinion.  We went in mainly for pancakes and I had my mind set on how I think they should taste, so I admit this is my problem.  The pancakes were good but not what I was expecting. They also didn't have bananas for one of them but it wasn't a deal breaker.    In all good place for breakfast and great service",

The young man that took over for us was very helpful and he accommodated is with everything we needed.   Besides the whole service incident, the food was very good ! We didn't have to wait a long time after we ordered, food came quickly. I don't eat meat so they allowed me to switch out meat for homefries w/ my combo. I recommend the French toast! So good !",

The chicken breast and waffles were also pretty tasty. The Hangover was a hot, yummy mess. The red velvet pancakes would've been good, if it wasn't drenched in that gross strawberry syrup. Maybe chocolate syrup would've made sense, or cream cheese frosting. But definitely no strawberry syrup.   Staff is nice. Parking was easy on a Monday morning. Place was fairly clean.

I was surprised to see the yelp average was less than I'd hoped .... but lucky for me it was not my experience.  They were very busy and it was actually nice that our server acknowledged that to us as we could kind of tell.  He was very nice however and took our order promptly.  I showed him my husband on a post on my social media with #stacksandyolks and is that how to get a free pancake? Yep! It's that simple. We let him decide which one to bring us.  I ordered an build your own omelette with cheese mushrooms and bacon. My husband got their churro waffle with a side of chicken.  My only complaint is that I asked for fresh fruit instead of hash browns but the fruit had not yet been cut up?! Ok ok ok force my carb loving butt to eat hash browns I'm not that mad about it.    We enjoyed the atmosphere we were in the back booth near the restrooms so it provided a little privacy but still got to see the action.  It is casual and small, clean and open.   Our food cans piping hot and my omelette was delicious - mine tasted like nothing less than fresh. The hash browns were plain but I liked them that way.  The churro waffle my honey is still talking about. But let ME talk about that chicken. Wow!! Juicy tender and perfect spice to it. We have never been able to find a comparable fried chicken to what we have in the south and this has been the best so far.  I would go back just for that chicken.  So good!   The free pancake he chose was actually probably not the free kind but we had been chatting with him and said we were from Reno and by golly I think he liked us!  It was pumpkin with whip cream and cinnamon and cream cheese frosting and was again, very good.  They had so many different flavors though that I would love to come back and try.  Very happy with our first experience here.",

They have large portions of food and the pancakes are delicious, so they get 2 stars from me, but don't go here if you are in a rush and you want more than pancakes.   Today, I went in to celebrate my birthday with my family. It seemed like a typical Saturday morning, not too busy, people coming and going. 3 different women came to take our drink orders and it went just fine. We got our drinks and then we ordered our food. The kids all got the happy face pancakes. I got the chicken fried steak skillet with a smore's pancake. My fiancee got the corned beef hash with hash browns and a side of \"bacon from heaven\". It took about an hour to get our food and for the life of me, I have no clue what happened. Ha.   The kids food was fine. The only real complaint is that they got 2 grape eyes (normal), and orange mouth (normal), and a nose that was 2 large tablespoons of butter (not normal). They were a little disappointed that the happy face was not made of chocolate chips. I should have asked.   My skillet was okay. The potatoes didn't seem to have any seasoning, so I just put salt on mine. I ended up not eating the potatoes. The eggs and chicken fried steak was really good and I have zero complaints about that. It also came with a biscuit and gravy. The biscuit was warm but the gravy was ICE cold. It was almost like they took a fresh biscuit and covered it with gravy from the refrigerator. I didn't want anything to do with it. Which was fine. I had quite a bit of food and had planned to take stuff home.   My fiancee got home fries instead of the hash browns he ordered, which isn't a big deal, but what sucks is that he specifically ordered hash browns so that our 10 month infant could also eat some. Then, his \"bacon from heaven\" was CHARRED, you guys. Charred. Like, someone just left it sitting there. And then they served it to him like that. It was beyond disappointing. The pork belly was basically chewy and yucky.   After all of this, we didn't throw a fit or make a big deal. I just said what was wrong and got apologies from the staff, which is fine. But the manager refused to speak to my fiancee after everything was said and done. We spent about $80 and they gave us a $7 discount on our bill. The food being wrong and served badly is one thing, but for management to not even come speak to us and apologize is truly disrespectful - especially since the kids told the waitress we were celebrating a birthday. I'm not saying a birthday celebration deserves perfection, but if a meal is ruined on a celebration like that, maybe some accountability could be taken by management. I'm so disappointed and sad about this. I really hope that management learns to take ownership and really guide their employees to do improved quality checks before food leaves the kitchen and even making sure the kitchen is properly staffed for a Saturday morning/afternoon. The table behind me waited just as long for their food too. It was a huge clusterf*ck and diners deserve much better.",

    "text": "Omg where do I start! This place is a hot mess!   Joel and I were on this side of town for his job and we hadn't eaten breakfast. Since it was a Monday other places in the area were closed. So Stacks & Yolks it was.   Right away when you walk in there is confusion. It's not a lack of staff either. There are plenty of people just total unorganization. When we were finally seated. (There was a hostess stand outside, but no hostess.) We weren't even given menus. We had to sit there for a while until we finally could flag someone down. They took our drink orders and came back to take our order. I had decided on the Crab Cake Benedict and Joel had the regular Corn Beef Hash with a side of sourdough toast. While waiting for our food I had to practically beg for a refill on my coffee and a water. Also, while we were waiting our waiter came over and asked if we had ordered something that we had not. Then he went around to all the other tables asking who's order it was. Wow. That was not a good sign. Our food came out and I was ready to dig in. The waiter not the original waiter asked what kind of toast Joel had wanted and he repeated Sourdough. The waiter said it would be right out. My Crab Cake Benedict looked kinda sad. The Crab Cake itself was crisp and tasty, but the Hollandaise sauce was clearly old cause it wasn't runny, but congealed. The potatoes had no flavor and tasted like something they threw on the flat top for 1 minute and pulled off. Well, after 10 minutes Joel finally got his toast. It wasn't Sourdough however, but Wheat. It was so dry and cold that the fake butter wasn't even melting. It was some seriously sad toast. Talk about sad was Joel's Corn Beef Hash. We were both assuming it would be freshly made in house. We were very wrong. It came out of a can and was gross. I really felt we could have made it better at home. He asked for his eggs to be poached. Which they were, but  they were served in a little bowl that still had some water in it. Why not put them dried on the hash itself?    So we are done with our meal and I ask for the check. The waiter said he'd bring it over. 15 more minutes roll by and no check. Meanwhile, people were standing outside glaring at us because they are waiting to sit down and eat! The waiter comes back and asks \"have we gotten our check?\" I respond with a \"no.\" He walked away. I was hoping to get the check!! By this time my debit card is out and I'm annoyed. Finally, some other guy brings us our check. I didn't even look at it. I just handed him my card and the response I got was a fist bump. Normally I'm down for fist bumps, but a fist bump is not an acceptable form of apology for bad service and bad food. Just sayin!   I will never again return here. It was a total waste of my money and my time. Believe me heed my warnings and steer clear!! Run, run now!!!",

That, and maybe it was just bad timing, but I've seen cleaner bathrooms at truck-stop gas stations.

Not really the best sales technique insulting the customers choice just because it's not your personal favorite. They told my brother in law they were out of the dish he selected 20mins after he ordered it. So he decided to go with the corn beef hash as well. It looked like they split my husbands corn beef hash into 2 very small orders in order to cover their mistake. We will not be back.",

Who actually knows who our food server really was? The food was pretty tasty albeit taking a while to get to us, however by the time we got it I was so hungry that I forgot I ordered a side of bacon that wasn't delivered, until I looked at the check and brought it to their attention. When I went up to the counter, the bacon was coming out, lol. To their credit they took it off the bill, but there's just too many awesome breakfast places in Las Vegas that are more affordable with much better service. Very Disappointed.",

There was a little bit of a wait but not too bad, it was a Sunday morning after all. Staff we encountered were nice and friendly. I ordered the Mexican Huevos (9.99) Tortilla topped with chopped Steak, Onion, Green Pepper & Cheese with 3 Eggs. I can't recall what anyone else ordered but my husband got a Single Stack Coconut Pancake (3.99) to try. The Coconut Pancake was huge, I liked it, I would go back for another pancake. But my Huevos weren't all that. The portion was huge! Gigantic soft tortilla with all the stuff on top of it. It was okay just nothing special, the steak lacked seasoning. I would think if it's called Mexican it would have some spice or heat but unfortunately it didn't. It was all rather bland. Everyone else at the table seemed to feel the same about their meals. Bummer. I'd give it another try but with all the breakfast joints around it may take awhile.",

My remarks: Walked in and was greeted by owner, we chose a table and the place was not busy a total of 5 people.   Owner came over after waiting several minutes and we placed our order, the order felt rushed as he was looking around constantly.  Order arrived fairly quick but it was cold and not as ordered. Fast does not mean good! The waiter (owner) did not check back to see if we needed anything. The guy who got us the drinks came back and I told him my eggs were undercooked, not as ordered. He took them right away and said o.k. I waited for 15 minutes no eggs returned. The guy then returned after 20 minutes and I said did you forget about the eggs and he said no and by then my boyfriend was almost completely done with his plate of food. He runs back gets the eggs and they arrive less cooked than last time, eggs were running all over the plate. I took the plate up to the owner who happens to be our waiter and told him to take them off the check.   He apologized when we were leaving, but the food was not worth the price!",

The Red Velvet pancakes were fine for the first couple bites, but dried out as you got to the middle. Seating is too close for comfort, and the blasting club music really didn't fit the ma and pa feel this place was probably going for. The most disturbing part was the faint sulfur smell that came and went during breakfast. They must have had some sewage problems or something. Blech. I gave it two stars because the service was very prompt, genuinely friendly, and it's not the waiter's fault that the food was ill-prepared.",

The orange juice was way too thick for my liking- I felt like I was eating an orange... From a cup. The ordering and paying process is a bit confusing, you're not sure if you sit down and wait or go up to the counter..

Just like their sister store in the east, The Griddle in the southwest does a great job of serving up the first meal of the day.   First off the service is great. Friendly people with a sense of humor. The place is tiny but great decor and there is also outdoor seating. I usually stick to the basic egg, canadian bacon duo but I did a combo on my last visit due to a severe pancake craving. All good! The choices of pancake flavors are plentiful! The coffee is also pretty great quality for a place that churns it out nonstop, not watery or lukewarm. The people next to us got a skillet and MAN it smelled amazing. Lunch lovers they take care of you as well with assorted wraps and sandwiches.   The pricing is just fine and just off the highway, can't beat the location. They do a steady business but I've never had to wait at this location. Watch for the sign though, you could miss it from the road!",

We had 3 different servers ask us if we had had our order taken yet. Organized much? My red velvet pancakes had to be sent back because we got out food literally like 5 mins after we ordered which great they're fast but my pancakes weren't cooked all the way through. During our rushed 20 min meal we were asked about 15 times if we needed anything else. Yes,,, let me eat!!!! And water. Which we never got from any of the 6 people who asked. I understand it's Sunday and having worked at a busy restaurant I understand to a degree. The nasty ass menus at 9AM NO! They should all be wiped down the night before. The disorganization was insane. Aside from my under cooked pancakes the food was fine. I'm sure we can find some place else to enjoy our pre drive home breakfast.",

It was big,hard, and touch to swallow. The environment had a weird vibe and The only thing that was quick was Sam picking up the her tip. The reason for the 1 Star is when we told the busboy about how Disappointed we were in the pancakes he laughed and said I know,  I heard they taste like rubber now.   It was funny in the moment but then I started thinking about paying full price for something that they are very aware of that's not good. So I'm saying NO to the Stacks and YES to the Yolks",

I came yesterday later in the day around 1 and there was hardly anyone in there. So if you're coming early in the morning be prepared to wait for at least 15/20 minutes. They have an awesome breakfast and lunch menu with really good options. I try something new every time. My first time here we had the chicken and waffles which were disappointing, the chicken was flavorless and the waffle was meh. My friend had the red velvet pancakes which were delicious though. I've had 3 of there egg Benedict's which I loved! The traditional was my favorite. The crab one was lacking something. The California Benedict was good not amazing though. I definitely recommend there skillets! We had a steak one with 3 sunny side eggs on top and man was that tasty! All of the skillets come with home fries (chopped potatoes) on the bottom. You have the option of egg whites or eggs prepared to whatever your liking is on top of the skillets. The service is always quick and friendly, I've never had a bad waiter or bad experience dining here. The only thing this place is missing is bottomless bloody Mary's and mimosas lol.",

    "text": "I have been to Stacks & Yolks several times now, but am not in love with the food or service. We started eating here because my husband is a fan of their Bacon from Heaven. Unfortunately, the last 4 times we have been here, it wasn't available and they did not even bother to tell us until 10 minutes after we placed our order. I mean seriously, if you are not going to serve it, take it off the menu or at least let the employees know so that they can tell customers right away!  The best dish I had from here was the Chicken Breast and Waffle. Unlike other breakfast restaurants, the waffle here is pretty thick, and the chicken was juicy and tasty. Here are the others that I have tried:  -Always November (single stack): This pancake had a good pumpkin flavor, but the cream cheese was too thick for my liking. The single stack was huge - I was only able to eat half of it. -Smitty (single stack): This pancake was just way too dry, but the mint flavor was not overwhelming.  -Biscuit and Gravy: The biscuits were not warm and the gravy was tasteless and horrible!  Service is a hit or miss. Usually, its not good at all - most of the servers do not care to check up on you or refill drinks. However, there are 2 servers that I remember who was very friendly and attentive. This restaurant is also very small and crowded. The tables by the kitchen counter are the worst because of the traffic and you feel uncomfortable eating when so many people are walking by and bumping into you.   Not recommended. There are other breakfast restaurants that are so much better in this city, so do not waste your time!",

They were sitting people throughout the restaurants and helping only the bigger parties, probably hoping to get a bigger tip. Terrible terrible terrible. Not to mentioned I just noticed this place was JUST on dirty dining (just my luck). I can see why! This place needs to be shit down.

It wasn't amazing or anything extraordinary, something you can make at home.   Service was fine. The staff is friendly. two things for me the irked me was that my husbands entree came way before mine. Probably waited a good 5 minutes by the time he got his to when I got mine. If I had ordered something complex I would understand the wait, but I literally just got oatmeal, topped with granola and chopped berries.    Also both bathroom doors are broken! That was probably the most annoying. I mean common fix your bathroom doors! At least one of them.",

We arrived around noon well after the Saturday breakfast rush and didn't experience a wait to be seated, which was one of the only pleasant parts of this visit.  There are hiccups in service & then there are flat out belches. We got a bit of both here. From getting a cute plate of sausage patties delivered instead of the patty melt I ordered, to my friend's waffle coming out 20 minutes after his eggs & potatoes did, this was becoming wayyy too much and too little in record time! I also got fries instead of the breakfast potatoes I ordered, which was also a fun bonus.   While it did take forever for all of our correct food to appear, it was all actually very good (praise the Lordt). Asked for a refill on water & quite a bit of it ended up on us instead of in the glass, which was fine. Had just come down from a hike, so that part was actually kinda refreshing. Don't have much of a reason to go back, but maybe this was just a fluke.",

I came in with my husband and we were told there is a 20 minute wait but there were plenty of empty tables so we told the hostess no thanks.  As we were walking out another gentleman called us back and said it will only be about 5 minutes so we decided to wait.  (possibility of a new hostess so we let it slide)  When we were seated we noticed the interior was pretty cool and the prices on the menu was reasonable so our mood was improving.  Our server was the reason it went down.  I didn't catch his name but it was a younger male and when we tried to call him over he literally gave us his hand and told us to wait while he was just standing by the counter... At this point my husband was really annoyed.  Luckily, our food came out and the pancakes were super fluffy but GINORMOUS so when I ordered a short stack (2 pancakes) I could only finish half.  There was another possibly hispanic female who did make sure our water was always full and we mentioned we wanted her as our waitress rather than our waiter but no matter, we probably won't come back.  I can get better service at egg yolks and they are way more busier than this place.",

When you walk in there is no direction on if you seat your self or wait for someone. I almost thought I had to go to the counter to order. The poor waiters were running around and barely had to time to clean tables. It took a while to get our order taken when we got in. I also had something in my drink and even though it was replaced that was no acknowledgement of my issue. We ordered pancakes and steak tips. The steak was great as well as the potatoes! But the pancakes were underwhelming. I could barely cut through them with my knife. I would consider back but it won't be my first choice for breakfast",

Before even sitting down, we already knew that we wanted to order a skillet. We ended up with the hobo skillet, which came with biscuits and gravy. Both of us were craving pancakes too. We were contemplating double or a single and it's so good that we got the single because the pancake was freaking big. It was bigger than the size of my face!!  All the food was SOOO good! I would definitely return. The waiters were all super kind and helpful and cracked jokes with us. They have a good amount of seats inside but also a few outside. I'd say the only down side of sitting outside was there were so many birds and they're not scared to come close to your table. This place reminds me of a old diner that just got a make over. Don't expect to be blown away by the quality of the food, but I think it's up to par!",

But....we waited for another 5 mins and had to ask someone for table settings. Water was from the tap and received better attention from the bus person. Ordered our meals and again waited for approx 20 mins for it to arrive cold. Or should I say lukewarm at best. I really do not like to write a bad review and I am usually pretty good about checking reviews before trying a new place.  I didn't do that this time and we paid for it. Most reviews were 3 stars and below. I give it 1 star because the bus person was good to us. She ordered buttermilk pancakes with chocolate chips inside. Chips came on the side and good thing because the chips were two different colors. Doesn't that mean they mixed the new with the old? I'll never know. The one thing they were very good at was making sure I got the bill and took my payment right away. When the waiter asked how everything was I was about to say there was a problem he said that's great and walked away. WTF! I will not be recommending this eatery. But I will tell folks to steer clear. You want a great meal and service? Three words. BLACK BEAR DINER!",

I took a bit out of one that I had to spit it out because it was hard and undercooked. The amount of hollandaise sauce on my plate was way too muchThey added way too much that by the time I got to my other side of the Benedict the bread was super soggy.

Our service was 5 stars + and the manager , Baja, even came by with a special waffle treat at the end !! Like we needed more food!! Hahaha!!  The service was outstanding and the food was delish!

For a place called Stacks and Yolks - unfortunately the stack was burned on both orders and the yolks were 180-degrees opposite of what was requested.   Ordered 2 Short Stacks - and both came out looking and tasting burned so even if the portion is big it's a big portion of burned-ness.  The eggs were ordered over easy - no joke, came out over hard. We sent it back and the guy comes back with the same plate of eggs and says the cook says these eggs are over easy. Are you kidding me? First you are rebuking the customer's claim and secondly, when is an over easy with a yolk that is scrambled and hard and the whites are browned?!!!?  Third time - guy comes back and finally it is over easy but yikes, sat in a bunch of grease. Too disappointed to even take pictures of all this.  So, all in all. I won't be back. I walk out thinking - should have seen the signs from my fellow Yelpers.",

On a first visit, staff seemed overwhelmed by a modest crowd at 11am, but were still friendly. Portions are substantial, and several of the diners seemed to be regulars. There's a bunch of flavored batters on the menu, and this might be your spot if pancakes are your thing.",

Next time I had to try their flavored pancakes. I picked the lemon flavor - oh yummy!  In general I'd say this place is pretty good. It gets busy at peak times and I think the staff sometimes gets a little overwhelmed. Everyone there is very friendly, though, and usually quite attentive. Also, the prices good and the place is clean. Stacks and Yolks is among my top 5 breakfast places.",

When I went, there was no line (around 30 minutes to closing time). The man at the counter was very friendly in going over the menu and what they specialize in. Even upon entering the restaurant, all of the waitresses were UBER friendly and nice, Everyone said good afternoon and smiled.   So cool note - they marinate their corn beef hash in new castle beer!! At first, I was hesitant because I'm not a fan of the dark beer, but you cannot even taste the beer yet the corn beef was so flavorful. It was different, but in a good way. I got the corn beef hash, egg whites, biscuit and gravy, and hash browns - this was for two by the way haha   I hear that it can get pretty busy here early in the morning, so it's best to come as early as possible. But it is worth it!!!!!! This has definitely become one of my favorite breakfast spots eben though I have yet to dine in - I took my food to go. Oh, and the portions are pretty big.  Definitely coming here more often!",

The head honcho though is kick ass. He's hilarious and always takes good care of us every time we come in. I've tried almost all the pancakes they have but my all time favorites are \"The Lips\" (red velvet with strawberries) and the \"Always November\" which is pumpkin pancakes with whipped cream and cream cheese. The only \"bad\" thing I have to say is that the location is small. Hopefully in the future they can knock down some of the walls and make the place bigger because it is a little cramped. Aside from that:  -Prompt service -Awesome staff -Bomb food  What more do you need? There won't be a Sunday that I don't have breakfast here.",

All places that have good breakfast/brunch typically are busy. Walked in and it was quite small but we were seated right away.  Everyone was SUPER friendly and nice however customer service was super slow but that was because the waiter said that he was the only one out on the floor.  YIKES!! They did have clean up crew to bus out tables for the next customers but for just having one person out on the floor with it being packed on the weekend is tough - With that being said it took a while for us to receive our food & beverage order. When the food came I wasn't impressed - Lacked flavor, quality of food wasn't fresh. Everything was just tasteless. Definitely wouldn't be my first choice. I would put this place on a back burner unless we were in the area.",

When we got there, there was a 20 min wait.  I just want to say, the seating of the customers was so scattered. There was free seats in off places in which could of been connected to create bigger tables. You catch my drift? We sat and ordered and I unintentionally timed the order to when we were served because I was on hold for an airline.  When the food came it was about 32 minutes later. I was intermittently asking about the food to the waitress and was told she would check on it. She never came back.  I asked the owner when our order would be ready and he said he had only one cook and apologized.  The food was not that great. The turkey sausage was cold and the eggs Benedict and English muffin were very oily. My daughter ordered a make-your-own omelette, and it was basically a scrambled egg with toppings.  They waitress also tried to tell us that they ran out of sugar. Really?! On a 3 day weekend?  I told her to check again, and what do you know? They had sugar.   All of this happened and the owner did not even try to ask what they could change to make the experience better.  No way are we recommending this place.",

    "text": "I first want to start off by saying that I am a manager at a restaurant. Where we have values and commitments to our customers to insure they are satisfied to their own liking.   First we were quoted 20 mins and ended up waiting 25-30 mins, no big deal.  Second we waited 10mins+ from the time we were sat till our initial greet from a very friendly man named AJ. He got our drinks (which came out at different times) and got us started and Also apologize for our wait, which was nice.  Third our server who never introduced her self approached our table and said \"are yalls ready to order.\" My friend asked her what her name was which it was JESSICA and also told her that it was our firsts time blase blase. Then we proceed to order. After we order we waited for our food which didn't take to long which was great.  This is where all the real problems start. Fourth my friends biscuit was dry and gross which they replaced with a fresh one. Our pancakes on the other hand were TERRIBLE. I had a party of 3 and all of our HATED it. We each barely took two bites each. (It was a double stack) we would of or could of told our server but she never came by to Check on us until she dropped our check. Which she didn't even have the courtesy to ask us for boxes nor did she noticed our pancakes were barely UNTOUCHED.  We asked this gentleman for a manager and waited five mins and asked another server for a Manager and she came back and said that she was taking a order and she be right over.  That's when JESSICA came over asked us what was wrong we told her we already asked for a manager she proceed to ask is what's wrong we told her we didn't like the pancakes and she told us \"well they're cooked right so i don't know what to tell you\" that when I said this is exactly why we asked for a MANAGER. Then this lady named Mariah came over and introduce her self has Mariah and not the manager. We told her we didn't like the pancakes she apologized and said there was nothing she could do. I was shocked. I offered to pay for the partial pancake we did try but I was not going to pay for something I Believed to be wrong/gross. Mariah told me that she wasn't the manager and wasn't authorized to take anything off my bill and that there was no manager on site to help me and that if I came back she could give me some free pancakes next time. Excuse me if I didn't like the pancakes why the HELL would I come back for more pancake. So as I'm talking with Mariah ,JESSICA came to the table and said there's nothing wrong with the pancakes we've been serving them all day and that they were fine and no one has complained all day  then walked away.   JESSICA was so rude and unprofessional that even Mariah noticed and after JESSICA Walked away Mariah apologize for JESSICA behavior and told us to hold on and she was gonna be right back. She came back with our bill and took the pancakes off and gave us some French toasts. At this point I was so fed up that o asked for the owners number which she gave me. She told me that he was just in the building but was to busy to talk with me and had to leave and that I should just call him. My bill was over 53 dollars after the pancakes where takin off so money was never an issue its the fucking service. They never even offer to remake them for us or get us something different instead the wanted to argue with me gang up on me at the table and proceed to tell me that they can not and will not help me.  I Called the owner twice the first time he said he'll call me back with the hour, two hours later nothing. I called again he said he'll call me back in 30 mins. Six hours went by NOTHING. At about 8:45 Bahador Emamzadeh the owner called me back. He was very upset I was calling his phone on his day off and that I had no right to call him so many time cause he was with his kids. I  informed him that maybe he should have a business card with his personal sale phone and title that says owner of he doesn't want to handle owner situations!!! And how am I supposed to know your busy you never TOLD me that. Any ways I told him how upset I was and my horrible experience and told him I didn't want free food or anything but I felt like he needs to know how his restaurant is ran when he's not there. This is the worst place ever. 4/11/16",

Not to mention, the wait-staff was terrible, our server \"Brandon\" insulted me by asking if I had \"even bothered to read the menu?\", never came to check on us, and when he did it was because we called him over after my wife and daughter had to stop eating because their \"ground beef\" was literally just big chunks of chopped up unseasoned hamburger. After finally just wanting to pay and leave, I asked a curly haired bus boy to take my check up to the counter to which he snatched the check, rolled his eyes, and slung it on the counter. As he walked away with a scowl on his face I realized you could see the young mans underwear. Seriously ? I've never experienced such disrespectful service from this place, and honestly would probably never visit again.",

It was definitely made to perfection and I will most definitely be returning until I've tried all of the different things that I didn't get to try on today's visit!

The hostess said the wait was going to be 25 minutes. LIES! While waiting, a woman said she was also told the exact same thing - that the wait time for a table would be 25 minutes. She was already waiting 45 minutes when we arrived. WHAT?! It's either the food is really good OR she had a lot of time to waste and wasn't really hungry. We had a group of seven hungry people, including 2 kids.  What really pissed me off (and apparently 6 other people waiting longer than us) is when the manager decided it was ok to seat a group of 12 that just walked in AFTER my group. When I spoke to the hostess, she said that the manager said to seat the 12 top. She was just doing what she was told. WTF?! What about everyone else that was waiting?!  That shows me that they don't give a rats ass about their customers. Note to the manager working the shift today - Yeah, the food may be good (I wouldn't know), but that won't keep your customers. It's all about the whole experience and how you make people feel. Your food may taste amazing, but I didn't need to try it to already have a bad taste in my mouth about this place.",

Not much to say because we don't want to waste out time, but in a city of countless breakfast places, stacks and yolks comes out on bottom.  We r in this industry and this place should be avoided at all costs.  Candy  the server was one of many that was lazy, not interested  and even sat down to have her food while we were still  waiting for our food to be completed.  Coffee was not full until I asked and juice was never offered again and never got checked on.  We were confused on who was out sever since many people came to us and we got switched 3 times to 3 different servers. No bueno. The only good part of our meal was Daniel the busser . For being a busser he checked in us more then the actual severs and he showed genuine interest in our concerns.  For first time impressions especially in this city and being 2 employees that work for the strips most luxurious hotels, guests ask us all the time where they should dine in this city off the strip. We get asked by thousands a year, and unfortunately this establishment will not be on our answers to them ;-(  Promote Daniel.  Sincelry nahum .",

On other times, we seen the waiter talk down to the staff, curse at them, talk bad & how stupid they are to us & complain abt the owner on how Cheap is like to be. We have seen this place just go down and its sad cuz it was great and still can be! Just need better management on staff to make things flow better!!",

I love the concept of being able to choose your batter and toppings and etc. but the execution was not to my taste. Syrup is half the battle and it was watery and really had no flavor. Always November had a delicious cream cheese whip on top but pancake itself was a little underdone and lacked the flavor punch I seek. My mother-in-law didn't care much for the gluten-free pancakes, she said they had an overwhelming almond flavor. The protein pancakes looked like it was mostly eggs and didn't really taste like a pancake. Kids loved the chocolate chip pancakes though, but what kid wouldn't?! Sweet server and good (but overpriced) fresh squeezed OJ, but since I'm all about the food I probably won't be back.",

Waiters have a little attitude and are not that attentive. It was also very pricy in comparison to baby stacks or egg works. I had the philly skillet and it had zero taste. It was like the beef had no seasoning and was just cooked and thrown on a skilled and the potatoes were just potatoes. The pancakes have no flavor and are super expensive for what you get. Dennys is honestly better then this place. If you're looking for good breakfast food in a town like this consider other places. $48 for a skillet two pancakes and eggs Benedict. Not impressive.

They're busy to arrive early if you need them to set up if you are bringing friends, and don't always expect to be seated right away.  I've noticed that they tend to get busy on the hour every hour.  I might recommend that you get there at 9:45 am instead of at 10 am, if you want an easier time sitting.  The day we went, we have a party of ten, but came a few minutes before ten, and were promptly seated.  Seating itself is pretty tight.  My party are all fairly fit people, who were easy to squeeze into small places, but I would think a larger person might find this setting uncomfortable.  A lot of people apparently agree this place is amazing, so they are always trying to get in and eat.  The servers are prompt and attentive, and I always have a pleasant time without needing to wait to long to order anything.  The food is heaven.  Some of my favorites are the pancakes -- I recommend the Pumpkin Pancakes.  While I have a sweet tooth for breakfast, they have great omelets, thick cut bacon, and sandwiches to satisfy a diverse palate.  I've never had a bad menu item, and my friends and families always leave happy and full.",

This is a hard review because the owner was amazing nice... but the red velvet pancakes... didn't pass my approval!  I ordered the red velvet pancakes... with egg whites, chicken sausage and potatoes. I didn't care for their version of red velvet pancakes! I was bummed out and only ate a quarter of it. Something was missing in their recipe... I had better. My friends cousin also didn't like her order of red velvet pancakes... and only took a bite of it. The rest of my breakfast was doable... hard to mess up right?!  I won't be back unless it's with the boys... if so I'll have to try the chocolate pancakes and update my review.  Can't complain... I only paid... tip... Baja took care of us.  As for the red velvet pancakes... Sorry. Fail.  Casual indoor dining. Check it out and lmk what you think.",

Then I remembered that I had noticed Stacks and Yolks is open until 9pm now and had been wanting to try it.   The place has very cute decor. I love the way that they've set up the restaurant, the logo is clever and they even have well designed merch for purchase. I looked up at the wall in front of me and noticed a big advertisement to vote for them in Best of Las Vegas. They seemed to be doing everything right (which is why I gave them 3 instead of 2 stars).   My brother and I both ordered a short stack of red velvet pancakes with whipped cream. They came out looking beautiful--great presentation. When I took a bite though I was very happy to be facing away from the man working there because I made an obvious face of disgust. The pancakes were downright gross. They were dense and gummy and the only thing that indicated that they were red velvet was the bright color. They were topped with raspberry (not the best choice) and chocolate drizzle over very cheap whipped cream (which I paid a dollar extra for). My brother couldn't even finish half of his. We both left disappointed and with stomach aches.   This place appears to have potential to be great, but the pancakes I had were so bad that I don't even care to try any other food they offer. It's a shame.",

After placing our order of two single stack(s) combos it took over 45 minutes for the food to arrive. This nice older gentleman brought the order from the kitchen was very polite.   As for the food. The only thing that was done right was the over medium eggs. The scrambled eggs where over done and dry. The pancakes where edible but nothing special. The bacon that came with the combo was well done on one side and raw on the other. How this place could possibly be voted best in Las Vegas is beyond me.   Oh one last thing before you go to sit down in the restroom make sure there is toilet paper cause I made the unfortunate mistake of assuming there would be some.",

My friend received a cup of coffee with lipstick still on it. Do you even wash them? Or check before you bring them to tables! The food is below average, no flavor definitely not worth your buck. Never got a refill, the waiters never checked on us. I came here a few months ago and over heard someone from the waitstaff (younger teenager) ask the owner something, the man told him to \"deal with it,\" grabbed his take out and left. He's also the a**hole with the white Mercedes who parks in the HANDICAP spot in the very front. Cmon dude are you kidding. How disrespectful. Did some research on the place, they were once on dirty dining. I will never return.",

The hostess is the front line of customer service and today I would grade her an F.

Ordered the pancakes which they are know for but it seems like a generic recipe.   The floors were dirty didn't seemed to be cleaned between customers.

He was workin' his bootie off but maintained a positive attitude and smile. The waitress on duty wasn't working as hard but was stunningly beautiful... maybe she is why the resturant was so packed? The employee tshirts are super cute and available for purchase.   The food was the lowlight... yikes!  I got a tuna melt that had a weird wet and mushy consistency... and a bizarre sweetness to it?! It was definitely made from the cheapest tuna available... at least I hope that was tuna!. I could barely eat half. Good french fries tho... and decent ranch. My daughter ordered a grilled cheese sandwich from the kids menu. It came on big, thick french toast bread. It tasted like powered sugar?! It was so greasy and odd tasting. She could only eat 2 bites. The flies buzzing around the table seemed to like it tho?!  We paid 19 bucks for two inedible sandwiches... always a bummer to leave a resturant hungry. I give praises to our waiter tho as he was polite and kind from beginning to end.",

The hostess was overwhelmed, put us on the list and said we only had to wait 7 minutes(group of 3) Another group of 4 came and waited 2 minutes before getting seated. Our name was crossed off the list and the hostess didn't realize until after she'd seated the other group that we were still waiting. She did not apologize immediately. She kept going back and forth inside. Finally she apologizes, takes us inside and makes us wait for a table to be cleaned that was still being occupied by other diners. When I asked her why she crossed off our name as \"seated she could only say \" it's been hectic.\" My opinion, get a new hostess. If she can't handle a brunch rush, then she needs to be moved and someone else who handles stress better placed outside. Once again. This is my second time at this location. The food is good tho.",

Another party of 6 came in about 30 minutes after we had got there and the hostess immediately said we were going to be seated at the same time. The other party of 6 was seated first, then we were seated right after. the hostess advised us we would  have been seated first but apparently the other party had called in prior to arriving. Really? Did they call in before or after we got there. Last I heard also you can't make reservations its first come first serve basis!   The selection  of food was good but we waited a long time for our food to arrive. When the food arrived, it looked good. Except for the chicken with the chicken and waffles. It could have been crispier. But it was cooked all the way through. the waitress disappeared for awhile and we wee not checked on more than once after our food arrived. After such a long wait and all the hype with this place being tossed around locally, I have to say I was extremely disappointed and will not bring family back here again.

This visit was much better, the service was far superior this time, the staff was friendly and attentive. My food was good, hot, and correct. No wait either, walked right in and was seated, as a family of 4 we usually have to wait. The pancakes are big enough to share so my kids shared a cinnamon pancake and my wife and I had skillets. The price was reasonable, though we only drink water which helps lower costs. We will definitely return again.",

People to our left & right ordered, ate & left over & over again. I really don't know what to say. Wow! I wish that I knew what the food tastes like. The service is zero. They have a challenge where if you eat 10 pancakes & 10 eggs in an hour, you can have the meal for free? What if you don't get food for an hour?",

    "text": "At one point I heard several radio commercials saying how Stacks & Yolks was the go to spot for the best breakfast. I looked up their menu and saw they had a lemon blueberry pancake batter and I was sold from there.  I got to Stacks and Yolks at about 1pm on a Saturday. They have a random table placed outside and what looks like a hostess station. There was no one manning the hostess station and after an awkward 3 minutes of just standing in front of it I decided to go inside. I approached an employee at a cash register and told him no one was outside, the hostess comes up behind us and seats us right away. The table was very small for me and my friend, so small that I had to place my keys and wallet on the floor.   The waitress comes over to take our order. I told her I would like the lemon......... And before I could finish saying blueberry she cuts me off and says WE'RE OUT....... No apology or even the common courtesy to let me finish my sentence. I end up deciding on a red velvet pancake and my friend orders an orange flavored pancake and we decide to share a chicken melt.   The red velvet pancake looks great visually. It's drizzled with chocolate and strawberry syrup. The chocolate however was very bitter and the strawberry sauce was very tart so I ate my pancake the entire with a face like I just sucked on a lemon. The chicken melt comes and also looks very good. The chicken inside the bread had to be about 2 to 3 inches thick so taking a bite and having that much meat in my mouth was very unappetizing. The fries that came with the sandwich were very good and the pancakes did have a yummy tangy whipped cream. Also it took a solid 45 minutes to receive any of this haphazard food.   Overall was very disappointed after hearing all the hype. I recommend The Cracked Egg. If you're trying to make a better breakfast choice.",

    "text": "So here is a review for another neighborhood breakfast restaurant... I should say we have tried almost all within 3-4 mile range and Original HOP is still a champ with Mr. Mamas coming in second.  Stacks and Yolks... neither your Stacks nor Yolks were good enough to get a good rating.   Yolks: ordered scrambled med/soft and sunny side up... both came out done wrong. Scrambled was all browned up (which is immediate turn off) and sunny side was fried hard on a bottom. I understand that we all want our food fast but it still has to be cooked right and I don't mind waiting a few extra minutes for that  Stacks: ordered french toast which turned out to be rather dry and chewy - not good. Pancakes were OK... but honestly they could make them smaller there is no need to waste so much food.   Bacon... looked like a post-nuclear strike atrocity.   Overall: not going back, unless they give food for free. Service was spotty, drinks were only refilled after waving and asking. Dining area is cramped and it is difficult to get in between tables.",

    "text": "I have been here a handful of times because I enjoy their pancakes, which are enormous. I love the different batters, & toppings & fixings they have to customize it the way you want.  I can always expect there to be a wait at Stacks & Yolks. During my recent visit, my boyfriend called to ask how long the wait was. It was 20 min. & they put our name down for a table so by the time we got there, we could get seated.  As usual, it was packed. The weather is nice so they had their outdoor seating, which doesn't look very organized as the set-up of the restaurant isn't meant for outdoor seating. That point was proven because a table managed to dine & dash. With tables hidden behind pillars & many people standing around waiting for a table, no one noticed a family with kids got up & left without paying. There was a waiter who was getting angry about it, blaming his other co-workers & cursing in front of everyone outside.  We got seated by the door inside. The waiter just cleaned it as they sat us down & left it very sticky. It's Spring now, but DO NOT sit by the door when it's Winter. The door opens & closes giving you a gush of cold air every time.  I dropped something on the ground & when I picked it up, I noticed how dirty everything was. My boyfriend went to the bathroom & said it was horrible.  I was not happy with my order of \"Crab Cake Benedict,\" but my boyfriend's \"Lemon Blueberry Pancakes with Whipped Cream Cheese\" were delicious. I never not order pancakes here so I know now to just stick with pancakes.  Overall, it's okay. It's not the best breakfast spot, but if I want pancakes, it's an option.",

    "text": "One of my favorite breakfast restaurants has officially gone from 5 stars to 1 stars. This is the second review I have written in 24 hours. The first was taken down by the owner after he sent me a angry message about writing it, slandered the name one of his old employees and then told me never to return. So basically I have been banned from the restaurant for writing an honest review about my experience at Stacks and Yolks.   First, I am a return customer so when the service drops it is noticed. The staff has a high turn over rate, they do not know the menu so the service and food quality suffer. The tables, floors are dirty and this is at 7:30 AM, so no cleaning isnot done the prior day.  Second, the quality of the food has gone down tremendously. Their recipe was perfection but the cooks have ruined them. If the regular cook is not there , it shows , the quality of food is poor. And cold when it gets to your table. Who wants cold food?  Third, It is not as busy anymore so the staff is running around to service just 5 tables and it takes longer when there is just one or two people on staff. Customer Service is suffering. Proper training would help. Owner comes in only so often and they past two times he was there, he was yelling at his staff , it is a small place so customers hear this, makes the place uncomfortable. 1 star from 5. This place has gone down hill from years ago when it used to be the place to go. Hope it improves, even though I will not return.",

I always get a skillet and a pancake when I come but over the years, I've come less and less and after today's visit... it's most definitely the last. The pancake batter had too much flour, which gave it a rubbery texture and only one side of the pancake was cooked while the other remained uncooked. I wanted to tell our server to replace it with a different batter but she was too busy ignoring us. My skillet consisted of maybe half a turkey sausage patty and they were stingy with the potatoes. The only reason I'm being harsh is because this place used to always deliver in quality AND quantity. It's just no good anymore unfortunately. I guess that happens when you get \"too big\".",

I usually opt for a make-your-own omelet and potatoes on the side. Egg whites for me please. There's always a wait but you won't be waiting too long. That's what I love about breakfast. People have things to do and places to go. Eat and go, keep the line moving. Now you have time to burn off those calories at IKEA...if you have the time, of course. ; )",

My Fiance and I are definitely making this our weekend routine. The service was just as awesome as the food. The owner even brought out these little french toast fried bites for free. So freaking good! He was super nice and really made the whole experience great. Made you feel like your part of his family and you are over at his house for breakfast. Truly amazing service.

They also have a lunch menu I've never ventured into, but the meals do look very appetizing. I've been going here for a while, even before they changed their name to the current one.

So we went to The Griddle down the street.  We were welcomed and seated right away and no 40 minute wait.   I obviously ordered the Short Stack Red Velvet Pancakes with (2) over medium eggs and (2) patty sausages combo. I ended up getting 3 eggs and 1 patty sausage, but considering I didn't finish everything, it didn't bother me.  They offered me several different meat options (bacon, link sausage, patty sausage and Portuguese sausage)  and the menu only listed link sausage and bacon. I have never had Red Velvet pancakes, so I have nothing to compare them to, but I was a fan. But you can't go wrong with fresh strawberries, chocolate sauce and red velvet. The boyfriend ordered the Meat Lovers plate or something, it wasn't really a omelette or a skillet. He said it was really good, and it had his favorite biscuits and gravy. He made a blissed out face when I asked him if they were good or not, which I take as a yes.   We had 3 different staff members help us, the hostess and drink taker seemed like the mother of the owner, a younger guy who was our waiter and another guy who joked around and brought us our food who I think was the owner. 'Mom' seemed sad that I ordered cranberry juice and not the fresh squeezed orange juice - I hope she hadn't been squeezing oranges all morning in the back!   I saw some grimy kid fingers on the painting behind us, but other than that it was clean. I wasn't offended by anything, and nothing but the grimy hand prints (that only can be seen from certain angles) stuck out at me,",

Walking in, it seemed cozy enough. Many of the tables were occupied, so I figured that since people were eating there, the food must be good. I ordered the chicken fried steak, and that was a mistake. Both the eggs & the steak were overcooked, rubbery, and absolutely had no taste. The tastiest thing on the plate was the gravy, and that was mediocre at best. The prices seem to be a bit steep for the amount of food they give you, as well as the quality of the food.   The waitress seemed friendly enough at first. However, as the meal went out, the service went down horribly. My friend had to go get utensils for the table, because none were provided for us. Nor were they very good about giving us refills for our coffee.   Overall, it was a bad experience. I wouldn't suggest going here. There are far better breakfast places to eat at in Las Vegas.",

We had 3 different people try to take our drink order, and then once we received our waters, we waited about 10 minutes for someone to take our food order. (The restaurant was only about half full) We waited another 25 minutes for our food and a server came to drop off the check. Once she noticed our puzzled look, she asked if we had eaten yet. (Which she should have noticed since our silverware were clean and had no dirty plates, napkins, etc) When I replied \"no, we haven't gotten our food\", she asked \"really??\", and walked away. We waited about another 10 minutes and we received our food. My husband had $9 pancakes and I had a $10 egg white omelet. Both were very bland. I asked the same server for a water refill and she said \"ok\" and never came back, so I proceeded to get my own. I have no idea how this establishment won a \"Best of Vegas\" award.",

Pancakes are light and fluffy, hot eggs (perfect and not greasy), toast (perfect), home-fries (real potatoes cooked perfectly, not tater tots like so many of the other \"Egg\" places in the valley).  Coffee is poured hot, fast and frequently. (again, like so many other places where you have to constantly beg for another cup) the coffee keeps flowing here. Stacks & Yolks is the trifecta of a great restaurant: Great Food, Great Service, Great value.  Fresh food served promptly - and they genuinely care about your dining experience. I think we found our new favorite!",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I have never written a \"negative\" yelp.  I only try to boost good businesses, but this place was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO horrible I had to post something.  DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES EAT AT THIS DUMP!  I stopped in for a weekend breakfast while I was running errands.  The help was fine, but the place was filthy and I'm not a neat freak. There were enough crumbs on the seat of the booth to make a piece of toast.  We were wedged between the bathroom and a cart that was so overflowing with dirty dishes they were falling on the floor and it wasn't even busy.   I ordered a waffle.  One would thing that's pretty basic.  It was so tough and rubbery it was  inedible.  It was topped with a handful of MARGARINE.  The Iced Tea tasted like it was instant..  I asked for the eggs soft and they were literally raw.  The sausage was thin, tough and almost burnt.  The person I was with got one of their \"specialties\".  It ended up being worse than a microwaved burrito from Rebel!  The entire restaurant was full of unhappy people and the manager/owner was walking around completely oblivious.  The table next to us hit the nail on the head.  \"They must of called this place The Griddle because  \"The Microwave\" was already taken.  There are so many great breakfast places in town (Sunrise Cafe and Cracked Egg to name 2) please don't ever patronize this dump.  Great restaurants are one's that take pride in what they do.  This place should be ashamed to be open.  And to top it off $30 for 2 people so pretty pricey.",

It had mushrooms in it and I requested to have them taken out and add ham. Well they did at a high cost. $1.00 to remove the mushrooms and $4.00 to add ham (not very much either). While I understand charging to add things I don't understand charging to remove. Wouldn't have had a huge problem with it (maybe the $4 for ham) had they mentioned it prior to handing us the bill. Will likely return but will know better then to request any personalization to the food.",

I didn't think I would find a breakfast place that I would enjoy as much as BabyStacks, but I enjoy Stacks and Yolks just as much. The menu has entrees that are more Americanized than that of BabyStacks, which is more along the lines of Hawaiian and Filipino, and you can see the difference in the demographic of those that eat at the two places just based on the menu. The entrees here give a good amount of good for the price that you pay, and everything that I have had were delicious. Their pancakes here compared to that of BabyStacks are bigger per pancake, but you're probably paying for the same amount of food for a full stack of each, with one Stacks and Yolks pancakes are about equal to two of that at BabyStacks. The pancakes here are really fluffy, which is a major bonus to me! I really love the food here and love coming here for it.   The only downside to this place for me is the service. They have a lot of young kids working here, as food runners I believe, which isn't a bad thing necessarily, but these kids need to learn about how to cater to customers. I didn't know they didn't carry Cholula, but I didn't know it when I asked. When I asked one of the kids if they had Cholula, all he told me was \"No.\" He didn't give me any alternative options to me and there was an awkward silence until I looked over to see what they had and I just asked for the Tobasco. The waters of my party weren't adequately filled when we has empty cups, the kids just walked by without any regard to our cups. An attentive server was the one to fill our waters up for us minutes later, but it shouldn't have come down to waiter if there were plenty of others that could have done it a lot earlier. Enjoy the food here! Just beware of their service when you eat here, if they haven't started to do things differently.",

The worst part is upon calling to speak with the owner I was told they would refuse to refund the amount spent because we were sent home with food to go in boxes (which never ended up getting eaten) and refused to accept any responsibility nor apologize for the terrible service.

    "text": "Hubby and I were just here for breakfast.  He was there yesterday and enjoyed his bacon pancakes so much he brought me back today - lucky me!  We were warmly greeted by the owner and as we sat down the nicest lady came by and took our drink order.  Fresh coffee and filtered ice water were brought right up. While trying to decide what I wanted I kept seeing plate after plate of delectable pancakes being delivered to other patrons.  Our waitress came by a couple of minutes later and I asked her what she recommended.  She recommended the lemon blueberry pancakes and I was sold!  I ordered a short stack (2 huge cakes) and made it a combo ( 2 eggs and 2 pieces of bacon or sausage) for $2.99 more.  It was packed but the service didn't reflect that - everyone was friendly and our coffee cups and water were refilled without having to ask.  Our pancakes came up about 15 minutes later.  They were huge and fluffy with the perfect amount of lemon and fresh blueberries.  They were so good they didn't even need syrup or butter.  Perfectly cooked eggs over easy and two strips of crisp bacon were served separately.  In hindsight I should have only ordered the pancakes.  I could only eat half of them.  Our server and the sweet lady that took our drink order came by to check on us throughout.  I am already looking forward to my next visit.",

This time we're trying a Belgian waffle combo (1 waffle, 2 eggs and 2 bacon or sausage - we're trying the turkey sausage). Large menu for breakfast,  lunch and some seriously wild pancake-based desserts! One of these days we'll come for dessert.    Okay, taste: Unfortunately,  waffle was also surprisingly DENSE.  Not really up my alley. Turkey sausage was decent, especially dipped in pancake syrup. Otherwise,  it was a bit on the dry side. Eggs were perfectly prepared.",

However I stumbled here on an oddly busy Tuesday and after being seated and waiting for my order to be processed for over 20 minutes, we never received water until after our food arrived. It was a nice day, but we were sitting outside in Vegas. Water should be the first thing in our hands... upon receiving my water we noticed a blue item attached to our ice. I didn't bother to get it fixed since being parched was what i was dealing with anyways. I may sound harsh but this is still a decent breakfast spot. I just have expectations for basics and that is why i give this place 3 stars.",

The service gets noticeably worse as they get busier which seems obvious but great restaurants don't make you feel that way. The owner is very friendly and always does his best to make things right.  The reason I can't give S&Y more than 3 stars is that something always goes wrong. The last visit our food must have been sitting quite a while as everything came out cold. One dish was so cold it wasn't edible. The sad thing is that when your food comes out correct and warm it is great. The pancakes are worth a visit.

I got coffee and the rebel eggs Benedict and my bf got meat lovers scramble. Then we waited...and waited...and waited. They didn't even come back to refill my coffee after asking random servers twice. Finally our food came after an hour of waiting.   My BFs scramble was good, but my eggs were completely over cooked. No run at all. At this point we were starving and I did not want to have to wait another hour to get them fixed. The hollandaise was good though.   So over an hour and $25 later, I must say I wish we had gone to Denny's instead.",

But my favorite dish is the Steak Tips (marinated for 18 hrs in unicorn tears).  I've never had a dish here I didn't like.  The staff here is always super friendly and easy going, which I've come to appreciate more and more over time.  Since we started coming here, my wife and I have had two kids ... and anyone who has kids knows you don't travel light and you always leave a trail.  My only complaint is that I've bragged about this place so much that it's gotten really busy ... some times I can't get in.  Luckily, they extended their hours to 9pm.  We just had breakfast for dinner tonight and it was great!",

My friend ordered the red velvet pancakes (which is the purpose of the trip to this restaurant according to them). I had the egg whites and turkey sausage with potatoes.    Now let me first say that I'm not a big breakfast person. Just give me a good cup of joe and I'm good. But the breakfast at this place is delicious! Those red velvet pancakes melted in my mouth.  All of the other food was yummy too.   I definitely see why my friend makes a special trip to Stacks and Yolks when visiting Vegas.   Mmm hmm...I'll be back!!!",

Brandon was very welcoming as well and made sure we were satisfied. Both were working very hard, just as everybody else was. My only suggestion is having more servers, it seemed that they could have used a couple. Or a busser. Other than that, I enjoyed my service today.",

I decided I had to try a Pancake since everyone seems to gush over their selection. I ordered the Lemon Blueberry and the server asked if I would like fresh Blueberries on top. It sounded lovely, so I agreed. Wow. What a disappointment. The Pancake arrived with CANNED Blueberries...you know, the little shriveled up kind that are usually added to boxed pancake mixes. It also was lacking any Lemon flavor. Hubby ordered a meat scramble that he said was OK. All in all, I have no desire to return.

He opened his doors and donated a portion of the proceeds for that day.   A great sum of money was raised for the IPOF.  We went in to accept the charity and stayed for breakfast.   The food was amazing and the atmosphere was great.   It felt really good to meet someone that is giving back to the community.   Thank you so much for everything.",

Our phoned in to go order wasn't ready and we waited 15 minutes to get the wrong order. Not a huge deal to wait because it's worth it.

I should've followed my cardinal rule that day, but decided to give this place the benefit of the doubt.  The floor had old coffee goo, shoe prints everywhere, and food stains.  I was concerned, but starving, so Darryl and I ordered food and waited.    Grilled cheese: not only could I see the oil between the cheese, but it was dripping out.  I never experienced greasy grilled cheese before, but apparently it's possible.  Darryl had something that was terribly greasy as well, so we ate what we were going to pay for and prayed for no diarrhea in the end.  The service was terrible, with young men running around not sure what to do.  They were slow as well.  The kitchen staff was young and looked unsure about what they were doing.  The worst part was it didn't look too tidy back there, which made me wonder about the freshness of everything they serve.    Will I ever eat at a Griddle again?  Probably not.  I am not entirely sure why others do, and I just hope that they fix their little cleanliness issue and vamp up the menu and flavors so they can stay in business.",

    "text": "I have been meaning to try this place out much sooner since it is right down the street from my house.   We were seated right away and our drink order was taken.  When our server came over she said, \"you guys ready to order?\"  No \"hi,\" \"how are you?\" or anything of the sort.  A little strange.  I ordered the french toast and added bacon, eggs, and toast.  Obviously I ate with my eyes.  It was okay.  There was way too much cinnamon on the french toast, even on the butter.  The eggs and bacon were just okay.  And my toast was forgotten about.  When our server brought over our food she said \"i'll be right back with your toast.\"  After a couple minutes of waiting I started looking around and saw it just sitting in the toaster.  The manager came over and asked what I needed, I told him my toast was just sitting there.  Obviously it was cold and hard when I got it.  My boyfriend liked his chicken and waffles.  I had a bite of his waffle and wished I'd ordered that instead.  Our server didn't check up on us,  just started clearing our plates.    I wanted to like this place.  It gave off a cute family-owned feel.  Not sure if it is family owned, but it was a bunch of very young girls working and \"family\" signs on the walls.  Their checks are old-school, they write it all out, which was pretty neat.   The lack of greeting/communication, forgotten toast, no check-up, and mediocre food earns this place two stars.  Maybe it was an off day, maybe I ordered the wrong thing.  Not sure if I will return.",

    "text": "Went here Saturday around 9:30 am. There was no wait to be seated-- I would assume there were 4-6 open tables. The hostess is outside and before seating us at the closest table, she went in to see if there was a table further in the back so we wouldn't have to be near the door getting cold every time it was opened. That was nice of her. Overall, it is fairly small inside; you have to wait for servers to grab food at the bar and take it to the table before you can walk past, and we were close enough to the table next to us that we could bump elbows with the other patrons. This is the reason for 4 stars. Our server was not as personable as another waitress, but that doesn't bother me. She was quick to take our orders. OJ is fresh squeezed and contains plenty of pulp. Pancakes are as big as a large dinner plate, 2 of us could have split 1 pancake and been satisfied.",

I left to pick up and pay right after I placed the order cause that's about how long it took me to get there. I get there and my food was ready  paid, got my order and left. When I got back home and got ready to eat... HALF MY ORDER was missing. I called back up there and of course my food was still up there. The lady told me \" yea you left it on the counter \" First off I asked if that was all of it BEFORE I left. So I had to go back up there.. They were so rude and my food was cold! Maybe if the man at the register rang ONE person up at a time this wouldn't have happened. A waste of my time,gas and $40.00. Never again will I return to this place. Next time make sure people's orders are ALL together for pick up!",

We were asked a beverage choice and we gave the order. The young lady returned with one drink and scrunched up her face and asked again for the other two. I'm really picky so I would say to most that wouldn't be a big idea. For me I'm thinking\"pen and paper maybe?\" Or at least don't make us feel guilty because you forgot . Moving on the server had a really good special description and if my mind wasn't already made up I would've jumped on one.  The food was really good. I had a tuna wrap(I know) my gf had the wheat pancakes(so damn good) and my partner had the country breakfast. We all loved the food and will definitely be back. Might write my drink order down though...:-)....I kid I kid... The griddle is dope and a sure fire hit for breakfast or lunch...  Deuces, Ish",

However we waited. They came over to the table after about 20min after ordering and dropped out check. I said \"we haven't gotten out food yet\". The girl said sorry we forgot to send it in and that she would rush it. Two more times we had this talk and at the end of the hour still no even started on our food. We went up to say we are out and they said...ok, bye. I'm big on customer service since that's my job and this here was a lack of paying attention and making it right. They should've been all over this. Making it worse we sat right in front of her the whole time. Not like we were tucked away in a corner.  Makes me want reconsider where I spend my time and money.",

However, I have never actually dined inside the restaurant, I've only ordered for pick up through the phone. This is only my second time ordering today and the service and attitude is the worst with these employees. Today my experience was calling in to order. The first order was their steak tips. The first guy who answered said they didn't have steak tips so I said ok give me a moment let me look at the menu again to choose something else. The first guy who answered said in the background to another employee \"hey can you take their order?\" Another man answered. I said \"just one moment please.\" And in the background noise I heard the employee say \"GOD!\" How inappropriate. Not even a minute later, with such a confused look on my face I told them I was ready. Then he said \"well I need you to hold on now\" and he put me on hold for 2 minutes. I honestly think it was on purpose. So I tried to be nice as I told him my order. They never repeat the order to confirm nor take a name down for someone to pick up the order. They said it would be ready in 15-20 min so my boyfriend left to go pick our food up. He proceeded to tell me that this place is a joke. He walked in not greeted and nobody spoke with him and cashier was running around people. Good service and good food makes a person want to return. Horrible service and good food will make a person never want to go back. So thank you for proving to me why I shouldn't go back. They have horrible service and their employees are NEVER kind.",

Love when you cut into the egg and it drizzles perfectly over the Canadian bacon and English muffin. The home fries that they were served with were perfectly seasoned and the small biscuits and gravy I ordered were perfectly smothered in honest how gravy. Yum!   I also had a bite of my fiance's French toast and wow was it good. Fluffy, cinnamon, sugary delight! They cooked the side of bacon he ordered just as requested extra crispy!

    "text": "I'm happy to have finally found a breakfast spot by my house that doesn't have an hour wait on the weekends. When we first walked up we were actually concerned that there was only a 10 minute wait when every other breakfast spot around us is an hour or more. Stacks and Yolks did not disappoint though, breakfast was on point! Hubby and I each got a different skillet, I got the Arizona. They actually bring the breakfast skillet to you the way it should be, still sizzling and popping on the actual skillet. We got a stack of buttermilk pancakes to share that were fluffy and delicious, oh and HUGE. FYI one pancake is the size of a large plate, so if you just want a few bites you can probably go with a single pancake. Service is also on point, really friendly and fast wait staff. Prices are normal for a breakfast spot, total was $46 for a family of 4 so not bad at all. We will definitely be back here for our weekend breakfasts.",

    "text": "Wow. Ok. I showed up with my daughter on a Tuesday  at noon. I told a waitress that I was waiting for another person to show up. My daughter and I were sat and asked what beverages we wanted. I ordered orange juice for both us... about 5 minutes later she showed up with one napkin and one silverware set (it was a party of three, you do the math)! I asked at 2:11 if I could order my daughters food: 2 scrambled eggs, house fries, and toast. My friend showed up right after and we talked for a little bit then another waiter came up to take our drink order. I reordered my orange juice and my friend got the same thing. They came back with them a few minutes later then took our order. At that point it was around 2:30. While I placed my order i asked the waiter if my daughter's order was put in since that order was given to someone else. He assured me that her order was being made.... 2:45 rolls around and they came out with my daughters scrambled eggs and potatoes. Forgot the toast. My point: why the heck did it take so long to scramble two eggs and serve luke warm potatoes onto a plate and bring it out to a three year old!? My friend was not happy. She asked our waiter why it took so long and he literally said \"sorry new chef\" and walked away. Once they brought our orders out they forgot my toast and got the stack quantity on my friends French toast order wrong so they charged her for more than what she asked for. And i had to take silverware and napkins from empty table next to us! I wish i could say the food was worth it but it wasn't. So mediocre! Needless to say i will never be back! Rude service and food i can make at home is not worth the gas money, time wasted for parking, and cost of the food! Sorry stacks & yolks- it takes a lot to make me write a bad review but people need to know!",

I mean i know  not to expect the best freshest tasting food if I'm getting it delivered or to go , but damn. This was terrible. I ordered the country fried steak with over easy eggs for my boyfriend & corned beef hash also with over easy eggs for myself. The country fried steak was super thin & the gravy was straight bland. The corn beef hash looked like dog food & tasted like the corned beef hash u get out of a can from the dollar store . Nothing special at all. Oh & our eggs were pretty much almost cooked over hard & the toast was literally crunchy. The only thing good was the potatoes. Maybe they just don't put in the same amount of care into cooking their food for take outs as they do for dine in customers because there are really good reviews. I don't know. If y'all are looking for some good corned beef hash & chicken fried steak, go to baby stacks. That's where I should have ordered from.",

My first impression of this place was ok, I thought the service of seating was a little weird. I didn't like where you had the host table outside, but with no one to greet you. But hey no biggie, perhaps there was a hostess inside that would come to our service. Wrong, it was more of like a hello please wait there.....kind of leaves no point of having a greeting table outside with no one there to greet you. Ok, on to the next issue. This place seemed a little crammed for seating. We literally sat right next to the cash register with a bit of traffic movement. You have waiters and people paying constantly, it's kind of hard to enjoy a meal if you're constantly being bothered by other guests. But hey, it's a family style breakfast joint so whatever.   On to the menu, I already knew what to get at this point so I waited patiently for my server. After taking my order, 10 mins later I am notified that the crab egg benedict was out for the day. I kind of scratched my head in confusion since the store just opened literally an hour ago. Ok, no biggie I revised my order and get a regular eggs benedict with bacon as a side. My bf got the marinated steak tips, which was kind of pricy but hey we live a little and splurged.   After ordering, our food was delivered in 15 mins which was quite fast. I was honestly disappointed in my food, the eggs Benedict was greasy and the bacon was burnt. My bf said his steak tasted like an underrated Filipino BBQ stick that you could get at seafood city lol. Yes, he can be brutal. I couldn't concentrate on eating my food since a fly kept buzzing around my head constantly bothering me.  Don't think I'd be returning to this place again, wasn't too impressed with the food. But hey that's just my opinion.",

We walk in, are told to sit anywhere that's clean and help ourselves to a corner booth. After maybe 10 minutes of looking around and watching guests who came in after us get menus and drinks, bro comes over and says \"you guys need menus?\" No, I'm here for the wifi and scenery. Of course I need a menu.   Another 10 minutes passes and a different girl comes over and says \"have you ordered yet?\" That was the extent of conversation from her.   Third person who appears to be the line cook delivers our food in reasonable timing but the order isn't complete, my bacon and eggs are missing.   The food was actually really good and I have no complaints in that regard, but in the middle of our meal a fourth server who we hadn't seen came by and dropped our check and walked away.   Server number 5 came to take the bill 10 minutes after we put a card on the table and by this point I was so over it.   Seems like this is a common experience out here based on the yelp reviews and there are enough breakfast spots in this town to choose from that I'll take my business elsewhere next time.",

That was the last time I saw my waitress other than to give me the check (with miscalculated tax). Someone else brought my food and napkins and the box I asked for.  The food was nothing special. If I had to choose between this and making my own eggs at home I would just save my money. The one star I am giving is because of their crafty hot chocolate that my 9 year old loved.   Oh and did I mention I sat by the bathrooms?! Normally it's not a big deal, except today when they decided to spend 45 minutes cleaning it while I ate. Nothing like the smell of a dirty bathroom and trash and toilet paper by your table to season your appetite.   I'll keep my money. Thanks!",

By the time my eggs and bacon arrived, they were extremely cold, maybe my waitress forgot about them, so I decided to just canceled my pancakes.  I ended up eating the left overs from my daughter, which pancakes came cold as well but she was extremely hungry so she didn't care about eating them like that.   We didn't have silverware and when we asked they apologize and they told us they didn't have any more silverware!!!! So we ate with plastic forks and knives. I'm so disappointed and I definitely won't be going back. They didn't even apologize or tried to make us feel better, so they really lost a loyal costumer.",

I ordered the Elvis, because I was attracted to the bacon filled, peanut butter batter...but I was disappointed.  I wanted the bacon to be super crispy inside the pancake, so it really crunched in my mouth, but instead they were larger, chewier pieces and I felt kinda sick afterwards. It wasn't even a tasty pancake unless I doused it in syrup.   While my waiter was nice enough, he never refilled my water until he brought me my check. However, I did appreciate his suggestion of only ordering a single stack (cuz them pancakes be real, real big.)    The prices were decent, and I may come back to try different menu items (like their deep friend french toast or a skillet) but I wasn't overwhelmed by this first visit.",

Long story short, I used to be all about yelping and I was a former Yelp Eliter and just lost interest so for me actually writing a review is a big deal cause I dont care anymore.   I ordered the hangover cure which was awesome and cooked perfectly with a great smooth black coffee.   Francesca was our waitress and she was the most personable, bubbly, nice, funny, etc (cue 7272847 more adjectives), by far one of the best I have ever had.   Other awesome people I had the pleasure to meet was Danni and Brandon, the manager. I had to talk to him and let him know about the greatness of Francesca and Danni   Not eating here is basically like missing out on life.. dont be a fool.",

I took my husband there for breakfast last week and when we arrived, we were told to sit anywhere. I guess that meant the ONE table that wasn't dirty.  This was just the first sign of many things wrong with this place.  - The chairs are absolutely filthy! - The floor looks like is hasn't been mopped in weeks! - The encrusted, nasty ketchup bottles are a total health hazard. - There NEVER seems to be sugar for your coffee. - There's visible dust and dirt on the stainless counter under the kitchen window - Kitchen storage looks unsanitary!  The food was lackluster. You're better off going to Denny's or an IHOP because its clearly a step up from this place. Service is extremely slow and they honestly don't seem to care. The OWNER, Bahador, (or Baja as the employees call him) was outside on his phone having a cigarette and is clearly in denial his place is falling apart.   This \"restaurant\" closes each day at 3PM so there is NO EXCUSE was to why this place is so DISGUSTING! I'd be surprised if this place is still open by Summer's end.   I will be contacting the Southern Nevada Health District and making a formal complaint about the unsanitary conditions of Stacks & Yolks!",

My mom and I ordered Togo today and she ordered the Elvis pancakes which is peanut butter with chocolate chips and whip cream...it had bananas on it with not chocolate chips and when she picked up the order she told the guy that's not what she ordered and he said he's that is the Elvis pancakes...we looked at the menu and it's not what she ordered and he was wrong and did nothing to correct his mistake!  We spent $50+ dollars for what we ordered and he could careless..remember consistency is key and I will probably never go back here after the way my mother was treated her first time there!!! Ugh",

I ordered the build your own burger (1st time for lunch here-maybe that's the problem.) The cheese on the burger was a lump of shredded cheese like they use in their eggs-not melted at all. The fries tasted like the oil they were cooked in was old. My husband's omelet was fair, but the hash browns were light brown and very greasy.   Hopefully you'll step things up again.",

The service has always been good, which brings me to the three stars.  The service is good when you can get service.   I've had four separate occasions in the last year where I (and my partner or guest) have gone in to sit down and could not get service.  Twice was due to being flat out ignored by the server and the restaurant wasn't full. The other two times (including my last attempted visit) were because they did not have enough servers on duty and therefore the wait just to get a drink or put in an order was extraordinarily long.  I like this place when they are on point.  I understand it can be hard to staff and people call in, but their staffing issues are no longer my problem.

So in case you don't fill up on the dish, you can fill up on the two pieces of toast!  For two of us, our total was $38; including drinks. So, it was not bad for a huge breakfast.

When food was finally ready, she handed it to me and said \"Food is on the house\" - Great service recovery, and a very sharp manager! 5 Starts to the managers for great customer service eventually!

Tucked away in a plaza also featuring fast food, foot spas and firearms suppliers, a fairly typical situation for many family-owned Restaurants spread across The Valley, those frequenting the area will likely know the space thanks to bold yellow signage visible from the street and with a large parking lot available those deciding to stop in will find the theme replicated many-fold on the inside where early morning remains fairly quiet save for weekends.  Once known for a fairly typical collection of Eggs, Hashes and Griddles but since going for gusto by way of oversized plates and Pancakes featuring a dozen different Batter flavors plus at least ten Toppings daily, it was immediately upon entry just prior to eight o'clock that guests were greeted and invited to \"sit anywhere you like\" by a lone young server prone to calling everyone \"boss\" or \"my man\" before knocking on tables as if by habit.  No doubt an all-ages environment, two men in suits discussing business at one table while two women, an infant and pre-school aged child occupied a four-top across the way, it was as current Pop staples played overhead that selections were made from a sizable collection, the ability to customize great for those who are picky or with allergies and the prices mostly on par with other independently owned Breakfast places.  Eventually settling on three individual plates priced $5.99 to $8.99, the \"10-Pancakes and 10-Eggs in under an hour\" challenge saved for another day, it was perhaps fifteen minutes before all three items were delivered in succession, the warm pseudo-Syrup quickly set aside in favor of the good stuff brought from home and first bites of the Churro-style 'Short Stack' immediately proving worthwhile as the fried Bread thickly coated in Cinnamon and Sugar offered a great crunch that quickly gave way to a soft custard-soaked center.  Moving next to the Pancakes, two $5.99 specialty singles requested and both barely visible beneath a mountain of toppings, it is surprisingly in their signature item that Stacks & Yolks comes up short as a result of flavors that simply taste 'off,' the use of syrups or concentrates likely at fault as the Peanut Butter's faint taste was almost imperceptible while the Chocolate tasted mostly like Hot Cocoa Mix, though in both cases the combination of Whipped Cream and all the rest were enough to make them mostly enjoyable.  ***In a city with no lack of Breakfast joints, both chains and independently owned, Stacks & Yolks falls somewhere towards the middle of the pack in terms of everything from price to service to the food itself.",

We had to ask for the pancakes after we had finished our meal and were told it would \"be awhile\" since our order would be behind everyone else's. Truly ridiculous. The only thing they managed to do was screw up all 4 of our orders. If your willing to ask for your order and then correct their mistakes multiple times, you will eventually get delicious food. Trust me, they make you work for it.",

They take forever to check on your table... and when they do, the interaction is horrible. For example, today, it took them 10 minutes to even approach our table (which did not have silverware) and ask is for our drink order. When one hostess did arrive with our waters, she didn't place the straws on the table, but rather tossed them on the tabletop and proceeded to tell us she would bring us silverware (which she never ended up doing.) Then our server did not take our order correctly and seemed inexperienced. The customer service always lacks professionalism, no matter who is staffed that day.",

Granted maybe we should have asked to sit there, but I was kind of flabbergasted.   The hostess sat us and brought out dirty silverware, with food residue and grease splatter. After asking one of the 4 floaters on the floor for a replacement, I ended up spoonless. Womp, womp.   No one introduced themselves, we had 5 people come to our table over the course of the meal so no clue who I was supposed to ask for the check. Just a kitchen nightmare vibe all around.

The current people today we're happy and attentive! There's an updated menu in an easy to read fashion. They still have their 10 pancakes and 10 egg challenge. They've updated the interior decor which is rustic and cool. There's MORE seating outside to accompany the long lines with a hostess stand. The hot chocolate was piled high with whipped cream, cinnamon and cho sauce and I regretted not ordering one.   I did try the marinated beef tips which were marinated for 18hours in unicorn tears. LOL literally. The tips were too overdone for me but my husband loved the dish. It came with a biscuit and gravy which was FANTASTIC. I would add some sausage chunks to this though. We also got the chicken and waffles and that was tender and perfect. The orange juice has a lot of pulp, just the way I like it!

Baha, the owner, is very helpful and accomodating. All of the pancakes here are works of art...from concept, to taste, to presentation. If you're on a diet, I don't recommend coming here because their pancakes & skillets will be too tempting; however, the \"Griddle Platter\" is a healthier option. I also love the fact that they have fresh squeezed orange juice. Their food is delicious, and their customer service is great!",

It tastes like a pumpkin pie, and don't forget to spread the cream cheese topping (it's not a lump of butter that comes on top, be sure to try it!!!). The portions are large, so I usually ask for a single pancake because they're so filling. Every meal has been excellent. The original server crew is excellent and most of the new staff is friendly. Baja, the owner, will often say hi personally to guests and will sometimes surprise us with a new pancake flavor. Btw, s'mores pancake? Pure flavor! I'm drooling! But it's sweet so leave it as a dessert.",

The customers shouldn't have to ask for a waitstaff to take their order and ask for place settings, or refills on there coffee and water or \"to go\" boxes. An attentive waitstaff should be in top of it, anticipating their customers needs. There's NO REASON for this BAD of service. I really love the food though, especially the skillets. So far there hasn't been anything I didn't like. The portion sizes are generous and the flavor combinations are excellent. My boyfriend and I especially like the outdoor seating available.

He liked his meal and they had Cholula :-) My oldest ordered blueberry and chocolate chip pancakes. She really liked the combination! She made it a combo with bacon and eggs. My youngest ordered the gluten free pancakes with chocolate chips. Now these pancakes are huge and she ate 1 2/3rds! Plus bacon and eggs as well. She really liked them. Now, for me. I tried to order the clubhouse sandwich but they were out of turkey. Next I tried to order the Veggie Melt, but they were out of eggplant. So I settled on a BLT on wheat. The bread was over-toasted - almost black in some places. There wasnt much bacon but what there was had crispiness to it. I ordered a side salad instead of fries. The bleu cheese tasted like ranch :-(  But the worst part of our meal was the flies and heat. The front door was WIDE open so two flies joined us and we left sweaty. I wouldn't go back myself, but it is hard to find gluten free pancakes at a restaurant.",

I love the food here I really do and I come in quite a bit i always feel at home here and never have a problem with the exception of this morning.i  always bring people who are in town to try this gem! But this morning I had my niece and nephew with me because they were begging me for chocolate chip pancakes so my first thought was stacks and yolks they have amazing food . So we go and I will admit it was a bit busy but there about 5 tables open. The three of us walk in and it's tight in there to begin with there is  no where to really stand but in the way \"traffic \". This young boy approaches me and asks how many I saw three he then  tells me well ur gonna have to sit out .. I said ya no I have two kids with me and it's 102 already at 11:30 I said there are 5 tables open he said okay it's a 10 minute wait. So we just stood there ... 4 other people walk in and no one ever greeted them we are all just standing there wanting some one to acknowledge us .. One of the four said to one of his friends damn I feel like we're a fire hazard because there was no where to stand... The icing on the cake was the more we waited and tables got up I just see people At the cashier standing there pretending not to see the line of people wanting to sit down ..i didn't see a manager at all when I was standing there either  ..  After that I gathered the kiddos and walked out .   Look  I am a manager at a local restaurant here in town .. I know stuff happens or there are off days .. But it was just a disappointing morning because I really wanted to take my family there. I will be back . I love the owner and I love the food .. I just wanted to make it known that u lost out on some customers today.",

I call over the hostess and ask her why a party of 10 who sat down 20 minutes after us were eating and we still haven't received our meal. 10 minutes later we get our food which wasn't bad. Very unappealing to the eye considering they forgot our order n had to quickly \"throw\" it together!!  They then proceed to give us our bill, which is full price!!  I work in the industry and if we make a mistake we at least try n make up for it. I again call over the hostess (who was the only person who would make any kind of eye contact or even glance our way) and simple explain our whole experience. She then tells me she will talk to someone n try n take care of something......... Only for my card to be charged the full price!!  I have never before been somewhere and something like this happen.

The food was late, there was probably 2 tables that got in after I did and they received their food first still. Once the food got there, the potatoes where cold, the egg was undercooked and just wasn't good. Its been like this for probably the last 2-3 times I've been here and I just kept saying to myself that it was probably a day where they were short staffed or something so I kept giving them a pass. Not this last time, that is the last time I go there for sure. Plenty better places to go to at this price. They get by off of their old reputation but like I said this place just isn't the same.",

Met owner, stand up guy who really runs a tight ship. The fruit cups, toppings and fresh squeezed orange juice are top notch...so hard to find ripe fruit in the desert these days.  They seem to be famous for pancakes and waffles...rightfully so, but I'm more of a skillet girl. Hubby and I tried Philly skillet which was great. Comes with a home made biscuit and gravy. Excellent, but I had to order more gravy.   Mom had buckwheat short stack and said it reminded her of her childhood. Dad had hash and said it was great. Kiddo had red velvet pancakes with strawberries and blueberries (Micky mouse shape of course) which came with bacon.  We all split the mint pancakes with whipped cream and lucky charms...different but very good - more like dessert.  We all loved it!!! This is my second time going and I will be back for sure. I wish these guys the best!",

Coffee was brought quickly and refilled without me asking for it.  The breakfast was ready quickly and it was delivered hot.  The lemon flavor along with the blueberries in the batter made for a nice combination.  I did not make a combo of my breakfast.  For $2.99 more, you can get two eggs and bacon or sausage.  That would have been too much breakfast for me.  I read the reviews on Yelp before going here and a few mention cleanliness.  That's something that's apparently not a problem anymore.  The floor was spotless except for some foot prints at the door and the tables were clean.  This is a very pleasant, small place.  I'd come back again.",

I would still love to come back a try the other pancakes, French toast, and chicken and waffles! I would personally just not order another skillet!

In my opinion Stacks & Yolks came in a solid average...I had nothing to complain about per se, but nothing to rave about either.  It was all just okay: food, service, ambiance.  A small place like this lives and dies according to the people that work there, and I don't think we got a very good server...so I try and not hold that too much against them.  If we're in the area we decided it would be okay to go again, so I may have an updated review in the future - with hopefully slightly more enthusiastic results.",

We notice the windows appear dirty and got fingerprints on it and it's only 10 am. Looking at the menu items they look overpriced, but we order chicken and waffles. The group next to us leaves. They cleaned part of the table and left dishes on it. The dishes never even got picked up while we were there. A few more tables leave and they never cleaned them while we were there. They tell people arriving to sit where ever, but theres only one table clean. We notice other people that ordered like 20 minutes after us get their order. Then as we were about to leave because we thought they forgot our order the food arrives. We get our chicken and waffles and it was kind of disappointing. The waffles were a single stack and the plates were not even full. Let me tell you this is the smallest chicken and waffles I have ever ate. Kind of overpriced for what you get. They never refilled our water or checked up on us during the meal. All they did is give us a check. Then us and another table give our cards to pay. 15 minutes pass. We notice one of the workers put up a sign that says cash only on the door. They never tell us anything about the one card register not working. We ask whats going on they said they reset the system and don't even know how long it will take. We end up going to the bank to get cash cause we can't wait any longer. It seemed like the one guy server with the beard was the only one doing work the whole time we were there.",

    "text": "Sadly, I have to give this place 2 stars... I was excited to try it out especially since they have gluten free options but after today's visit, I think it's necessary. The whole experience was frustrating and I was disappointed that none of the staff seemed aware to how poorly they were doing. Here are my major complaints:  1) We stood \"in line\" to be seated at the makeshift hostess stand (out front)for about 15 minutes before anyone acknowledged us. At that time another 2 top had also walked up and was hovering a bit closer to the HS. She immediately greeted them and when my husband mentioned we had been waiting awhile before them she responded with an \"Oh\" and just took our name.    2) We were told the wait was 15 minutes... We waited 45. This could have been somewhat avoided too. I noticed several un-bussed tables that sat unattended for a good 10-15 minutes.    3) Once we were seated everything went relatively smoothly. Greeted quickly. Drinks came out in phases but relatively quick. Staff was a bit stand off-ish and obviously confused about quite a bit. I have dietary restrictions (allergies) so I feel like I'm playing Russian roulette when servers seem confused by my questions.   4) This isn't really related to us but I find it disgusting... The table next to us sat dirty for nearly our entire meal and the \"hostess\" kept piling other dishes from different tables onto it. Both unprofessional and gross.   Food was ok, not my favorite and was definitely not played to be appetizing to look at. The check was dropped off without a thank you or any real acknowledgement. Our entire time here was over 2 hours because of the set backs. All in all, I really wanted to like this place because it is a locally owned small business but I doubt I'll be returning.",

(I heart breakfast with a passion) This visit tops the list in yummy b'fast joints I have had the privilege to eat!   We dined on Christmas Day and was pleasantly happy to know this restaurant was open. The decor was great and the staff was super friendly. We were offered the booth in the back and happily followed the server to our dining spot.   Things started out terrific, ordered a cup of coffee  and tried to figure out what yumminess I will partake as my entree this morning. Well, it was early and I need as much coffee as I can physically engulf in one sitting... I finished my first cup and it took forever to get a refill (and equally a while for someone to take our order.) I had to ask someone for a refill but it still took a while for them to fill my cup, I ask my brother if he would be mad if I just got up and filled up myself, I mean the coffee pot was only a few steps away, but finally someone came by and filled my cup... (They may of heard me talking about really needing a refill... don't mess with someone who needs coffee to function early in the morning) It's a simple request and don't know why it took so long? I may of been more annoyed seeing everyone else get a refill or getting beverage while I waited for a while? Or maybe the restaurant started filling up? Or maybe the orders for food all started to pile up... It's dumb I know, but it was kinda annoying... Either have bigger cups or keep the caffeine flowing when you obviously see an empty cup at the end of a table. Just sayin'  Anyways, moving on the the important stuff, THE FOOD! I ordered the cranberry orange pancakes and a single order of French toast... My bro got the steak and eggs and my niece got a single blueberry lemon pancake... Well here's the deal. I pretty much hate pancakes (with a small exception, ahem - mister mcalpine)  many pancakes I taste have a weird starchy taste to them that is unappealing to me... Since this place has such a plethora of options of flavored, I thought why not... Well I had a small portion of nieces lemon blueberry pancake (she's 3 and since the lotions were bigger than MY head I felt obliged to help her out) well, HOLY SMOKES!!! YUM! Very flavorful, fresh and yummy!!! No weird starchy taste!! By far my most fave pancake today... My orange cranberry was good, the orange flavor was subtle but equally d'lish... It was filled with cranberries and a glaze that was simply fantastic!   I think once the staff got things back in order everything went back to normal and they were attentive and helpful....   If you have a chance to try this delicious establishment- go do it!!!   You won't be disappointed!!",

Service is all right although theres times where my cup of coffee is empty and i guess nobody pays attention to it.. took them 32 minutes and 16 seconds to bring out my food, i mean it wasnt that busy.. but im going to try this place again and im bringing my wife and kids and see how they do on that time..",

They have been consistent in service and food prep. i would recommend it for a good american breakfast.   i noticed last time we were in that they are open for dinner.   My only recommendation is that they clean the glass windows and especially the entry door. There are times when staff is just standing around visiting and that area should be kept up.  The first impression is that dirty door glass and windows!",

He is keeping this place a float. You might want to hire some more people like him or you will soon have an empty restaurant on Sunday's.",

We we promptly seated, but waited more than 10 mins to be acknowledged by a server or bus person. In fact, the two parties that came in after us had their drinks and orders in before anyone came to our table.  Food was ok. Nothing out of the ordinary. Had to repeatedly ask for water refills. Service counters were dusty and glass partition between dining area and kitchen hasn't been cleaned in a minute. Seating is crowded, not much room for people to walk to/from their table without being on top of other diners.",

The other server noticed I cut open each egg and barely touched my food and he offered to bring me more eggs, if it wasn't for him I would have scored this place a 3. I would also come back purely to be entertained by Taylor!",

It is worth it. all the kids wanted the happy face pancake and it was huge....all our kids could have split instead of ordering 4....but they were super happy. I had the carne asada skillet (special that day) and a red velvet pancake and my sister had a coconut pancake....so big and so good (did I mention she hates pancakes and she loved this one). My husband had the corn beef hash....he said it was great but the portion could have been a little bigger (he is a big guy). Only thing is they don't serve alcohol so have your mimosa or bloody mary before you get there..... We will be back!!!",

The staff greeting us upon entering from every section of the restaurant. We sat down and we were handed menus promptly. The staff had energy and worked amazingly together. Our server Talia was phenomenal. She was attentive and answered questions. I always walk into restaurants wondering if I would come back and almost instantly I knew it was one of my new favorite places. Major kudos to Talia, Brandon, and Allen for making us feel welcomed. You are one of the best teams I had the pleasure of being waited on by. We usually compare our servers to the ones on Disney Cruise Line and without hesitation I felt like this was one of those teams.",

    "text": "So today we made our first visit to Stacks and Yolks.  A lot of action for a small space,  but it was Sunday and very busy.   The food is good,  but the real asset to this place are its employees.  Awesome service with smiles and attentiveness.    That being said... We ordered gluten free pancakes for an extra $2,  which we are used to.  The gluten issue is an allergy,  not a preference. The pancakes came out looking incredible.  Big,  fluffy and delicious.    Here's the kicker... No gluten free options to put on the pancakes.  No syrup,  no butter,  no honey.  The regular syrup and honey has gluten in it.  So the pancakes had to be boxed and taken home.   Initially I was going to give them a 3 star.  Who makes gluten free objects,  but fails to augment that dish with gluten free sides?   Well,  the manager or owner rushed over to our table and tried every thing to find a gluten free option for the pancakes.  He listened attentively as we explained how the syrup he has in the restaurant has gluten in it.  He seemed very surprised and promised to get a gluten free syrup. He was very kind and apologetic.   So all you prospective managers out there,  learn from this guy at Stacks and Yolks.  Simply because of good communication between him and a customer,  I bumped it up to a  4 star.   We will return in a week or so to see if they added a gluten free syrup.",

    "text": "For those who know me, they know I'm all about my breakfast foods. Bacon, eggs, waffles and all that jazz. So stacks and yolks seemed like it would be my kind of joint, and it was in some ways. The pancakes were huuge which was awesome, but wasn't as good or as sweet as some of the other breakfast places in town. The eggs were great when part of a scramble but not as good in the omelettes. I think maybe the omelette eggs didn't have the little bit of batter some places put that make it thicker. I'm a bit of a bacon snob, so it's hard to blow my socks off and they didn't. The bacon was passable because it's bacon and hard to make bacon bad, but man I would've lost it if they had a nice applewood or a thick hickory. Overall, it's not my top breakfast joint, but if you're in the area it'll definitely satiate your hunger",
