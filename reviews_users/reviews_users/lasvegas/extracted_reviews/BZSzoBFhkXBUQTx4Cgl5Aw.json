Nothing amazing, but (very) generously portioned breakfast fare. Coffee was decent. After a road trip through the south I'd argue the biscuits were less than ok, and suggest you order a different side.  Come before 11 -- we had no wait at 10:30, but saw lines as the hangover crowd amassed half an hour later.",

This first visit was decent, with a pleasant waitress and acceptable coffee. My hash browns were plentiful but undercooked. The fresh fruit consisted of a few small slices of cantaloupe and honeydew. The hub's breakfast special was just okay. Considering there aren't many breakfast options that early, I'd suggest giving it a try. HOWEVER, don't go when it's wicked busy (probably from 8am to noonish). Our second visit with a party of 6 was just short of a disaster. Wrong orders, cold food and no coffee refills. The wait staff seemed pretty overwhelmed. Not a good thing in a big tourist town. Clearly, it's the earlier the better with this one.",

Aside from the \"B\" Food Safety Restaurant Inspection card rating (at the time of this review) posted at the cashier, this place seems to be pretty good and pretty affordable (no crazy inflated pricing) .  They even have an awesome deal on burger's and fries for $4.99 which is pretty damn hard to beat anywhere in Vegas.  This became my regular breakfast joint considering that I could get a bowl of quality steel cut oatmeal with blueberries, bananas, milk & brown sugar for a few cents more than a small cup of water with oats from the local Starbucks.  For a decent breakfast such as pancakes or french toast, it pretty much beats anything you'll find at your local casino in regards to value. I mean it's not \"gourmet\" food but it gets the job done at a fair price.  The service is pretty good considering. I never had any problems with the waitstaff, hostess or cashier.  This will be my regular go to breakfast joint when I feel like saving some cash in order to splurge on other cool stuff in Vegas.",

Our servers name was Javier.  He made up for the initial entrance with hostess. He was very polite and professional.  I had an order of eggs benedict with a side of fruit for my little girl. Overall food was decent, and hearty.  The hostess did come up to me to apologize for her actions. No hard feelings, she's young and seems newer to the industry.

We had our orders, food and excellent service within minutes. I must say we had the lumberjack slams - French toast, sausage, egg, bacon, ham and seasoned country potatoes $11.49 (great deal). Hats off to the chef! It was delicious and quickly devoured. John was checking on us frequently and our drinks never dry. Thank You John!! Food was 5/5, and service 5/5. We will come back again.",

The fruit substituted for a meat choice was 4 small chunks of melon on a separate large plate.  I liked the cinnamon roll French toast a lot, but wanted 2 pieces, which she said was not an option. She could bring me 2 but it would be the same price. There was nothing a la carte listed on the menu, though my mom ordered just eggs and English muffin. I'm not sure what she paid, but they served it on 2 plates. The pancakes and waffles were good, as were the omelets, and I asked for poached medium expecting I'd get poached easy but at least the whites would be totally cooked, and that's what I got. The dinner included mediocre garden salad with some brown leaves, the \"grilled cod\" was chewy and the veggies were fresh but cooked weird - very salty and smoky and sparse cauliflower heads and broccoli spears. All on a plate 2x too big. The pies are ok but not better than grocery store. The staff is the worst part - super fast and obviously not interested. All 3 times whatever the 1st person said they wanted to drink, they repeated back: \"so 4 coffees?\" or \"waters?\" It was disconcerting and kind of stressful. Finally looked on yelp and I see there's a Denny's right around the corner. Hopefully my co-diners will be up for the walk - I can't eat at Coco's again!",

It was very good. The server (Tameka I think was her name) was very attentive. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the interior decor - it is in desperate need of a makeover.  It also doesn't come off as the cleanest place - but my table and all plates, silverware and glasses were clean.",

I came with a group of friends that were raving about the breakfast food.   When I walked in I was initially turned off because the restaurant was old, didnt smell the greatest, and looked like it was in desperate need of restoration.   The waiter came to the table to take our orders, he was very nice.  As I looked over the breakfast menu I was overwhelmed by all of the tasty options they had to choose from-it was very hard to decide.   I landed on the banana, walnut, and caramel pancakes with eggs.  These pancakes were TO DIE FOR. It was so good that despite being full I was still eating. The pancakes alone get 5 stars from me.  Unfortunately the eggs weren't good. I had to add lots of salt and pepper to get them to a decent taste. And I noticed everyone else at the table adding salt to their eggs.   Overall the food was good. And I was very pleased. The restaurant itself could use a serious facelift.",

It was right down the street from our hotel (Luxor) and was easy to get to with lots of parking.  It's a nice \"hole in the wall\" joint with lots of locals.  The service was great and we had a very nice waitress. My husband had an omelette which he throughly enjoyed, and I had the corn beef hash with poached eggs.  The eggs were cooked perfectly but the hash was a bit over cooked and the potatoes in it were mushy.  We really enjoyed the coffee cake which tasted like pumpkin and the coffee was great.  Overall I would come back again next time we're in Vegas.  It sure beats spending an arm & leg on the strip any day!",

Things I watched during breakfast: someone trading weed for money, some literally double fisting a bottle of gin and an orange juice, a group sharing a 40 oz, and a couple pulling up in a S-class MB with a woman not willing to get out with the previously mentioned group outside of her car. It's a good reminder of how big of a shift the area can be just off of the Strip.   As for the food, it's a chain bakery / diner. I enjoyed my cinnamon roll French toast. I asked for my bacon crispy, and it was cook just how I like it. The waitress was very pleasant and efficient. Overall, I think I like the food because it reminds me of my hometown, but I don't need this kind of excitement when I want to eat. I'll just stick to getting it delivered.   5 for the waitress 4 for the food 1 for location  Avg. 3 1/3 stars",

First of all, you can get food from both the breakfast and the lunch menus, which was nice since 2 am is kinda in between the two. Second, both menus had healthy options low in calories and sodium, which is great in a city famous for excess. The service was great and personable, and all food was cooked exactly to our preference. The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because it's quite grimy and depressing inside. But otherwise it's a great option for unpretentious, affordable food.",

    "text": "I stopped in here for take out breakfast for 2 this morning before heading back to LA. The experience that I had which should have been simple ended up being so bad it's almost laughable.  In case you need a reminder of the basics when working in the food service industry, just read this review. This covers most everything.   1. Greeting customers When I entered this place, I walked up to the counter where you pay. There were 4 employees standing directly behind this area chatting with each other about non-work related things. They looked at me but did not say anything for what seemed like forever. 2 of them left and the other 2 proceeded to chat about a stain on their hoodie (a conversation which also included the hoodie being placed on the counter to show the other worker). While I stood there feeling awkward, one of them looked at me with a very obviously irritated look because clearly I was interrupting their personal chat time. After more awkward waiting, someone finally came over to greet me.   2. Workplace knowledge I asked a question about one of the menu items and was given wrong information. The basic question involved what sides were included with the menu item. I apologized because I thought I was wrong, but then after ordering I googled it and found out that I was right, so I went and \"changed\" (aka corrected) my order.  3. Paying attention When I received my order, I was not given the coffee I purchased. When I asked for it, the worker was unapologetic and didn't even remember how many I ordered.   4. Basic food safety/proper cooking  When I got back to my hotel and was eating my food, I noticed that the sausage was totally pink inside (see image). I'm no chef, but I'm pretty sure it's not supposed to be like that.. In addition, I was only given utensils for 1 person. Total fail.   The only good thing about this breakfast was that the pancakes were tasty. However, the soggy bacon and undercooked sausage don't allow me to say that the food was good overall.   I don't want to say that all of the employees at this location are terrible, but the 6 young ones that I encountered this morning definitely do not do their jobs appropriately at all.",

All this place has going for it, is location, location and location.  Those staying at the nearby Motel 6, American's Best Value Inn, or Howard Johnsons, might be lured there by the convenient location.  Cleanliness not the best, food mediocre to poor.  For gawd sakes, if you are looking to eat, there are SO MANY other places nearby (not on the strip) that are more worthy of your money and dignity and taste buds.  At a minimum go west onTropicana a few blocks to Einstein Bagels, or north on Koval to the cafe at Super 8.

    "text": "There are quite a few reviews of Coco's in Vegas, but this Coco's in particular I could not find. This little place right across from the MGM is a little secret. I came here Christmas morning and was warmly greeted at the door by the manager. He walked me to our table, taking note of my party and specially assigning the largest and most private table for us. Immediately after I sat down, before I could even get comfortable, there was a very happy bubbly staff member who came to greet us as well. Afterwards, I probably don't really know who my server was because there were a total of 3 who greeted us and periodically came and checked on us to see if we needed anything additional to our order, but my review for this particular Coco's is about their excellent customer service, warm tradition to coco's standard trained staff and of course their food. Their hash potatoes was excellent and warm. Infact the server brought it out saying \"some of yours was already done and the rest weren't, but I didn't want it to sit there and get cold so I'm bringing you these first, is that ok?\" so she brought it out first. That is SMART and absolutely considerate! When all our food arrived, we enjoyed a good hearty meal.   The host also sat us down with recommendations, for what taste the best and what was best priced. I think this Coco's and this staff is worth my review, and a stop for anyone who doesn't really feel like some more cold/warm buffet and who want some hot food (just make sure you let them know you want it when it comes off the stove).",

Yelp to the rescue with nearby recommendations! We were staying at Aria and were able to walk to this off-strip diner... (though it was kind of a long walk in the heat).  Wait, there's a liquor store next door? That doesn't cost an arm and a leg for a bottle of (good) tequila?! DOUBLE SCORE!!  Walking in to CoCo's was like walking in to a mom and pop diner back home (Ohio) honestly. You get the greeting like you're an old friend who knows where everything is. Ordering was easy, the prices were friendly to our pockets and the servings were PERFECT!  We ordered brunch items and I cannot complain at all. Again, this put me in the mind of the good mom and pop diners back home.  Service was attentive... never really had to wait long for anything. I will definitely return to CoCo's during my next Vegas adventure.",

The waitress was in her 50's, had big hair, and called me 'honey' in her low smoker's voice; the decor was multitudinous -- flowers, knick-knacks, and pictures covered every surface in an effort to draw attention away from the fact that the building itself was in a sad state of disrepair;  I felt like I could have been anywhere in time.  It was late, and we were hungry.  I ordered chicken fingers with french fries.  The fingers were more breading than chicken and obviously came from a bag in a freezer, and the fries weren't very good either.  Liberal amounts of ranch dressing helped out.  My friend's Southwest scramble was a little weird too, and came topped with Asian fried noodles.  Whatever.  It was quick and easy.  We probably won't go back, but it wasn't a bad experience.",

But, here, it was cooked to perfection, the service was top notch, and the prices were really reasonable!

    "text": "This is a convienantly located breakfast establishment for some morning eats after a long night in Vagas accross the street from the MGM on Tropicana street. I would say it's similar to Denny's but slightly less expensive if you order their daily $7.99 special with 2 eggs, 2 bacon, hashbowns and either a biscuit or pancakes. If I ever visit again, I would try the biscuit since the pancakes and, especially the syrup, weren't very good. There are many much cheaper places in Vegas for breakfast but this is very convenient if you're staying at the MGM Grand or the hotels close by like Hooters.",

    "text": "You have to love finding relatively cheap eats around the Vegas strip area. This place is comparable to a Denny's restaurant but with a sweet twist. They have an old lady that comes in and make desserts for them daily. These desserts seem to win Awards at various functions, so they are supposedly very good.   After many rain delays and finally making it to Vegas, I was hungry, and this place is 20 feet away from my Hotel. I went in and automatically realize that they were a Denny's style place.  You know I took the time to look at all of the deserts in the display case with the accompanied awards won for the dish. I asked what the specials were and we're giving three different specials. The staff was really nice and actually gave me the pros and cons of each special. I was told that they were known for the breakfast and their burgers, but the burger that was on special was really small. Of course I went with the breakfast special that was essentially $7 for 2 eggs, 2 sausages or bacon, 2 pancakes, and choice of country potatoes or hash browns.   It was a lot of food and a great value. All in all, it was decent eating at a great price. The pancakes had great texture and was very big. Overall the breakfast was decent, but nothing to write home about. I can't give them more than three stars until I try their desserts. I saw that they had a homemade banana cream pie for $8 for the entire pie, but didn't wish to eat an entire pie by myself...that night!  All in all, if you want decent food at a great price, this place is a great find right off the Las Vegas Strip.  Be warned, some people may not like the surrounding area at night!  I did see a bum sleeping behind the building in the shade.",

After a long period of confusion, we realized that half of the line-up was for people trying to pay their bill.  I had to use Assertive Crystal and get us seated before I pulled my hair out.  Apparently Assertive Crystal scared the befuddled hostess and made a few waiting patrons angry, as I suspect we were seated too early.  Oops.  None of this should have happened.  Clearly the current staff are not cut out for this madness.  I had a very plain breakfast and somehow the toast wasn't good.  They put way too much butter in the center and the crust was a bit too hard and dry.  I didn't think you could screw up toast but it was the first time ever that I wasn't happy with it.  Everything else was acceptable and my spouse enjoyed his omelet.  His glass of orange juice was massive.  I thought the atmosphere and decor was a little weird.  They were prepared to celebrate Easter but it looked like the entire restaurant was decorated by a Kindergarten class.  Maybe it actually was.  We ate here because it was convenient and I'd only go back if that were the case again.",

After waiting for almost an hour for our breakfast, the lady, Carmina was her name, came to our table and said: tell me again what you ordered because yours was never placed.  I was in aw when I heard the lady, without even offering an apology, that we needed to order again. The way she said it made me believe that it is so common at this place to just have the costumer wait for an hour for their food then tell them to order again. When I was walking out I explained to the girl at the register what just happened and it was like I didn't exist.

    "text": "I haven't had a place make me want to run home and do a review in a while.  We were staying at the Hooter's hotel and decided to grab dinner at Coco's.  I am vegan so finding options to eat is not always easy.  The two older women who work at dinner time were extremely sweet and helpful.  I was able to create a salad that wasn't on the menu and it was delicious! I think my order may have been the most complicated because I was inquiring about different vegetarian options to check if they were vegan.  They even had to call the owner to verify some of the items lol.  Well at the end my salad was huge and filled with all my favorite foods.  I give this place two thumbs up and will definitely keep returning. :)",

We ordered the raspberry blintz pancakes with eggs meat and hashbrowns. Let me tell you their breakfast is worth flying to Las Vegas for!!!!! It is decently priced and located close to the strip if you are a tourist like we are. I'm telling you to check this place out while visiting or living in Vegas. They have a variety of things to order from burgers to breakfast. I wanted to stay another day just to eat there again. Will be back in a couple of weeks for round 2!!!!

I got the chocolate cream pie to the resort.  And it was not good at all. Taste like a sugar free pie. I called and the manager and he said he would return it. I thought that was nice. So I took the pie back and got a coconut cream pie. Got it back to the resort and omg can u believe it was even worse. It should have been called a coconut pie. Minus the cream. It wasnt even edible.  I did not call back. It was a waste of my money and time. Goes to show you. Not all chain restaurants are equally satisfying.",

The wife and I stayed at America's Best Value Inn right behind this little gem.  You couldn't have a more conveniently placed eatery.  Not only that, its located within an easy walk from the \"Four Corners\" area of Las Vegas Ave and Tropicana.  Secondly - its open 24hrs a day!  Craving breakfast at 5pm?  A t-bone steak at 4am?  THIS IS YOUR SPOT!  Thirdly - The food here is delicious!  The menu is varied and extensive...from cinnamon rolls as big as a plate to prime rib and everything in between!  Fourthly - The prices!  By Vegas standards, this place is a BARGAIN.  Breakfast specials from $5 on up?  I'm \"all in!\"  The prices here are very reasonable, especially when your not in the mood to binge on buffets.  Fifthly - The service.  Every time me and the family dined here, the waitstaff was very attentive and friendly - just the way it should be.  Really... there's not much more I can say about this place other than, if your staying in Vegas and want good food, a varied menu and a great price... this is your place!  Enjoy!",

But I was hungover and unfortunately it was Sunday so our only other options were expensive ass brunches. No thank you.   This Coco's needs to hire new hostesses. It was so busy on St. Patrick's day morning and the hostesses were clueless. Maybe they were exhausted from partying the night before too? I dunno. lol. There was this busboy that took charge and he pretty much seated everyone. I used to be a hostess myself. Shame on you girlies for not being on your A game.  Zenayda was a rockstar and kept the coffee coming. I ordered a veggie omelette and holy guacamole it was HUGE. I of course am a fatty and hungover so I ate all of it and it was so good. Props to Jose in the back.   We had to pick up someone from the airport so she got us in and out of there super fast. Poor girl she had such a busy section. I watched as super picky people told the hostesses they kept wanting to sit in her particular section (I think she had the most booths). Why do you people like booths?! Booths are disgusting and uncomfortable gross.  Anyways this place was a lifesaver. Drank enough coffee for three days, ate enough omelette for three days, and got out of there in like 30 minutes lol. Thank you honey you made it possible for me to go through the rest of the day and party it up later for my birthday.",

She actually told us what to get for a better deal and that comes a long way when your in Las Vegas.  The coffee was really good there too.  I recommend this place for breakfast.

A decent amount of pretty sub-par food for extremely cheap.  We came down on a tight budget due to winning tickets to Vegas unexpectedly.   Since breakfast is the most important meal of the day, we had to find a place to eat.  I seen Coco's when I walked across the street to get a bottle of liquor the previous day.  My wife and I came here expecting cheap, greasy, fast food for cheap, which is exactly what we got.  I remember getting the San Diego Sunrise.  BLUH!! What a shitty mess.  Ground chuck? Is that what you call that?  Chipotle Holindaise.....That was pathetic.  Avacados? Well, hard to mess that one up.  The whole thing overall was a culinary wreck.  The avacados wouldn't even stay on the patty because of the nasty slippery \"holindaise\".  The eggs were fine......I'll admit that, but the patty itself was nasty.  The next day we came here I went for a classic eggs, toast, sausage and pancakes. MUCH BETTER.  There's that basic borring food I was looking for!!!  At least I could eat it and finish it, unlike that nasty stuff from the previous day.   Service was OK.  We had the same waitress both times we came here.  My wife had a really hard time keeping her coffee topped off and I had a hard time keeping water in my glass.  We had to keep waiving down other servers to help us.  In short, it's better than starving.....but not by much.",

We stayed at a hotel right by the Hooter's Casino, and had to find a place for breakfast our first day since our hotel did not offer any.  A short 5 minute walk later, we found Coco's.  Best value for all the food we got.  $6 for two eggs, bacon, hash browns and pancakes??  SOLD.  We all loved it so much, we went the next 3 days in a row for breakfast!  We even joked how even though we were on vacation, we felt like \"regulars\" there.  The service was quick, never waited more than a couple minutes for a table (and there were 6 of us), and everyone there was very nice and friendly.  The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because their bathrooms were pretty dirty.  Other than that, I must say, when I go back to visit Vegas again in the future, Coco's will be a MUST!",

It was nothing special, the waffle was puffy and bland.  The washroom was a hell hole, I tried not to touch anything.  Stuff was not cheap either, with orange juice and tip it totaled $16.

    "text": "My husband and I went here for breakfast on Christmas Eve and were delighted with the food. The food was delicious yet affordable.   My husband ordered their breakfast specials for $7.99 (available Mon-Fri). It was a pretty huge portion consisting of pancakes, sausages, eggs and potatoes. But for the potatoes being cold and not evenly crispy, everything else was yum. I ordered the Multigrain and Nut pancakes with sugar free syrup, egg white scramble and ham for $11.99. I don't see many restaurants offering healthier (yet delicious) choices and hence was delighted. My only disappointed was that they didn't offer \"freshly squeezed\" orange juice.  This hidden gem is close to Hooters and is about a mile away from the middle of the strip. I personally didn't mind the walk on a cool December morning. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for affordable and healthier  (low calorie, low sodium, gluten free) options at Vegas.  P.S. These guys had some delicious looking pies. We we're however too full to eat anything else after breakfast.",

    "text": "My order was incomplete, they claimed I was lying, and the food was soggy and bland... pretty much a loss - I would not recommend this to anyone. Details are below:  I was excited to try this place based on all the good reviews but my experience was terrible. I made my first order which included the steak and eggs. I didn't know it wasn't available until I found out after waiting for a while that they had simply cancelled my order! I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and order again, this time with items that were all available. They accepted my order. Then when the delivery person went to pick it up, she noticed my order was wrong so she was kind enough to call me so that I could talk to someone in the restaurant directly and make sure I got the right order. After a confusing conversation, the person from the restaurant confirmed every single item on my order. Only when I finally did receive the order, it was missing a whole dish, and a second dish was incomplete.   I then called the restaurant to let them know, and the first thing the manager says is that the dish I didn't receive (the corned beef hash brown and eggs) was not available (even though I had JUST confirmed it with the server 30 minutes before) and then proceeded to talk to me as if i was lying about the order! After I let him know that I was staring at the receipt and the restaurant charged me for items I never received, along with all the numbers on the check, only then did he proceed to actually give me my money back. Finally. After two hours of waiting.   Food: the cinnamon roll French toast was soggy and bland, the omelet was the only thing that tasted good. Either way, I am never coming back here due to both the customer service and the lack of good tasting food.   (FYI, I ordered for delivery through postmates so maybe I would have had a better experience if I had actually gone there in person.)",

This was worth the 12 minute walk!  Large menu with lots of options at great rates - you can do a full standard American breakfast for 7.99!  I went back a few times and tried different items in the breakfast menu - everything was good, diner style.  Service was fine - a little slower during the busy periods, but not unexpectedly. They got one of my orders wrong, but were able to remake it fairly quickly.  Coffee was nothing to write home about, standard diner quality, about as good as the free hotel coffee.  If I'm back and nearby again, I'd eat here again!",

I always order the Blackened Baramundi dish. I don't know who was in the kitchen today but they need to learn to FULLY COOK the food. Fish fillets usually don't take much time. My fillet was raw down the center of it and my zucchini was so hard it tasted like it went straight from the fridge to the microwave and on the plate. Very unimpressive!   That was the food. Now, the real disappointment happened when i tried to enjoy my slice of Pecan Pie. Like, what happened? I think it's old.... It has to be old. I'm gonna post the picture i took of the pie. You be the judge. I was in a hurry to get to work. My best advice, check your food before you leave. Cocos is normally one of my favorite places. But today they LITERALLY put a bad taste in my mouth.",

I pulled up and thought, okay, looks like an older coffee shop type place, and I like those ... NO.  NOPE.  Upon opening the door there was a funky smell, I thought maybe the sewer backed up, but then I was seated and felt light headed, and realized that smell was the additive in natural gas.  I got up, ordered pie to go, and the hostess seemed bothered by this \"fast\" choice of mine.  I'm not trying to die in Las Vegas, so, yes, it's fast.  I mentioned to her that the odor was awful, there were four people in the place besides employees, and I don't know how they could stand it.    It took me a while to get my head to stop spinning from being in that building.  The woman insisted it was some sort of cleaner they were using in the kitchen.  Funny, but, no.  The pie was great, I ordered coconut cream, but turned out to be banana cream, and it was spot on delish!!!  That's why they got the second star.  This Coco's needs serious upgrading and better air flow.",

My MIL did get the coffee cake instead of toast/biscuit and it smelled really good and everyone liked it (I did not have any).  The only downside is that it was hot in there, and I mean more then a tad warm...it was hot. As soon as you walk in you notice it and it was just as hot in the back room we were sat in as it was up front. If it was cooler I would have been happy to stay for more coffee and some of their pie, but I couldn't do it.

I turned on Yelp, and BAM there's Coco's right down the block from our hotel. I called immediately and they were crazy busy (apparently everyone else was also hungover). It took about 15 minutes for me to place an order to pick up since it was so loud and they had just changed their menu.  15 minutes later, we dig into our well deserved meal. It was perfect. I ordered the corned beef hash and poached eggs. The corned beef hash was much better than I expected. It had flavor (although it could've used some hot sauce) and the eggs were poached nicely too. It didn't come with any toast so I ordered a couple of biscuits. They were not good. Avoid if you can. Otherwise, my friends all dug into the pancakes, eggs, bacon and sausage and there were zero complaints.  Coco's was reasonably priced and delicious. If I'm in the area again, I wouldn't mind stopping back in for another hungover breakfast cure.",

My coffee was never less than halfway full. They also have regular creamer and French vanilla crwamer. Nice to have options.   Everything that we ate was delicious. I suggest trying the whole wheat nut pancakes. They are delicious and not always at the top of people's list. They also give you A LOT of food. You won't leave hungry, guaranteed!   Overall, it feels like a breakfast place from home. The people are great.  The food is great. The cost is great. The location is great.

We also did the weekdays special which is eight dollars! 2 eggs, choice of hash brown/potatoes, meat, and either a biscuit/toast/2 pancakes/etc. It is more than enough food.

We stopped by for breakfast and ordered the egg platters with home fries and blueberry muffins.  The results were a mixed bag:  The eggs were decent; the home fries were essentially a pile of salt; and the warm, fresh muffins were delicious.  When we mentioned the saltiness of the fries to the waitress, she said they were pre-seasoned and the salt couldn't be reduced.  Given the restaurant's focus on fresh-made baked goods (the pies in the front case looked amazing!), we expected freshly prepared potatoes rather pre-made home fries.  Coco's is fine for a low budget meal in a high budget area.  Stick with the baked goods though and avoid the potatoes.",

Long story short a nice lady named, Donna, waited on us and she was absolutely fantastic! Although it was Veterans Day, I didn't even say I was a veteran and she guessed it and said Happy Veterans Day to me! Wow, how cool is that?   Point I'm making here is that this is a great Coco's.  Great food, great people working, and True kindness to all customers.   They even have history in helping out Police Officers respond to 'The 2017 Las Vegas Mass Shooting Massacre'. More than likely they kept everyone all well fed during the response to help people in need and who's knows what else. I'm sure it was amazing what they did in order to get a plaque on the wall about it acknowledging them. I will post the pic I took in this review, so you can see.  Until then, God Bless this Coco's Restaurant location, the workers there, and thank you to all for a great meal and your kindness on Veterans Day!   Thank you from my heart.  Mike  #VegasStrong",

The menu has changed some, but the classics are all still there. The burger I had was great and was actually cooked medium like I asked! The cream of broccoli soup was also good, but slightly different than how I remembered. Maybe I had built it up in my memory... While I didn't try any pies, I do admit they were all beautiful in the display.",

Our party was served by Ana who had some help from Jesus. They were so friendly and hospitable. The muffins we ordered as appetizer were delicious, specifically the blueberry muffins. Warm and moist served alongside butter. I got a chorizo bowl with potatoes and seasoned poached eggs. It was delicious and hit the spot. My husband got a breakfast sandwich of some sort which I had a bite of. Overall, the place reminded me of a nicer (though outdated) better version of Denny's. It has that diner feel to it. Definitely will be back after a night of drinking on my next trip.",

I ordered the Over 55 senior breakfast which consisted of eggs, bacon & a delicious homemade biscuit (light & buttery). The breakfast meals give you different choices of muffins, pancakes, croissants, oatmeal, potatoes, bacon, ham, etc). There were so many different breakfast specials it was hard to choose).  The food was fresh, hot & delicious. They also have assortments of homemade pies, muffins & waffles. Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll definitely be back for breakfast!",

Had checked this place out on Yelp and it had a lot of great reviews and since it was right beside where I was staying, I decided to drop in.   This location is older, possibly in the original state since they built it. It looks old inside and out, but not disgustingly old.   I was seated immediately and my waitress came fairly quickly to take drink orders. I think there were only 2 waitresses at 8 pm and there were lots of people at tables. With that said, our food came out within 10 minutes and was hot, fresh tasting, and the portion was huge. Probably could've shared mine as I hardly was able to finish 1/2 of my food. I ordered the San Francisco Sourdough burger which came with fries. It was so good! The burger was well cooked and was perfectly paired with sourdough bread, which is my favorite. The burger came with a huge pile of crispy fries.   My waitress came around several times to make sure everything was good and to refill drinks. She was nice enough, just seemed really busy with all the tables that she was taking care of. The guy at the register was super friendly with a very bubbly personality and he was very  accommodating.",

Just watch out for tacky Mexican-style paper decorations hanging from the ceiling, and very blustery A/C even on chillier spring days. There is a lighter-option section on the menu, and the back of the menu includes a \"55 plus\" section with affordable healthy options for the 55+. However you don't need to be 55+ to order from that section (I sure am under 55 and got something from there!). But really, all the prices at Coco are very affordable with just about nothing over $20. We ordered: -tuna salad. Very generous portion, more than worth it for the price. The tuna wasn't too creamy and rich so it's a good healthy option. -chopped steak with cheesy bread. The steak was not the best steak ever, but for the price, it was a very good value. I wasn't too thrilled with the cheesy bread, perhaps next time I'll order steak only.  I will warn you that service is a bit slow considering how simple the dishes are. However the staff are friendly and easy to find if you need something. They also have an impressive pie collection that we didn't try yet. Anyway at any rate, Coco Bakery is a great place to recharge your tummy before a fun-filled day out in Vegas.",

The coffee is not very good at all, the menus on yelp are outdated, the table and silverware were dirty, etc. There was a gaping hole in the ceiling from water damage as well. The server, John was the only thing saving this place from getting one star; he made sure we told him that we weren't satisfied even after we kind of tried to play it off.

Thought nothing of it everyone else was still eating looked like a busy place.  I got my pancakes they looked great took a few bites and the middles of each one was uncooked.  Wife started looking hers over and there was a black curly hair on a piece of melon that came with here meal.  This was our experience.  Went in looking for some breakfast came out grossed out.  I cannot recommend this place.",

The only thing left on my plate was a little bit of hash brown. Everything was flavorful and tasted right on point!  There was a little too much fat on the bacon but I just ate around it.   Order Accuracy: A Everything came out as ordered.   Selection: A They have a very vast variety of dishes - breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert, kids menu and more!   Service: A The waitress that was taking care of us was very attentive.  Drinks stayed filled and she was around just the perfect amount to be attentive but not annoying.   Price: A For the taste of the food and the service - right on point!  For reference it's like iHop or Denny's pricing if not a hairline cheaper.",

When we walked in the very first thing I noticed was how absolutely run down and dirty it is - then the worst part hit me. It REEKS of urine in there, everywhere. I thought maybe I just got a whiff of something, but the rest of my group smelled it too and it did not go away. In fact, it was probably the worst when we sat down at our booth in the back. We were all literally gagging and couldn't even consider buying food from here. We got up and left not even 30 seconds after we sat down, it was that bad. I thought maybe this was just a bad day for their sewage system or something, but there are other reviews from months ago that say it smells terrible in there. Also, there were a few giant holes in the ceiling that were covered by black trash bags. What?! The health department REALLY needs to come inspect this place because it is definitely not sanitary or safe in there. You will literally lose your appetite for the rest of the day if you so much as walk in there.",

They are open 24hrs serving a full menu.  We wandered in here searching for breakfast fare and we were not disappointed. They have a vast breakfast menu consisting of stuffed Crepes, French Toast, Pancakes, Omelets and any other kind of combination that you could want.  I didn't pay much attention to the Lunch/Dinner menu but it seemed to have just as much variety as the breakfast.     The Wait staff was very friendly and accommodating.  My only regret is being too stuffed to try some of their bakery items which looked very tasty.  For the money, quality and escape from the bright lights, you can't go wrong with Coco's.",

When the food finally came out . The waitress just threw our plates on the table. She didn't ask if we needed syrup for our pancakes , ketchup for our fries or napkins.

Everything came out as ordered and quickly.   The restaurant was so good that we had to return on the morning of our last day in Vegas before our flight.  The restaurant was busy but service was still above and beyond. We were seated immediately upon entering and the server came right over and asked what we would like to drink.    I ordered the Western Omelet with fresh fruit.  It was a large portion and so tasty.  The fruit was extremely fresh and juicy.   I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone in the Las Vegas area.  It's open 24/7.  You can't beat a restaurant that is reasonably priced with delicious food and great service.  Eating off the strip will save you a bundle and in most cases the food and service is much better too!",

I ordered an omelet that had hash and gouda cheese, my friend ordered a chorizo and egg burrito.  She said hers was the spiciest she'd ever encountered, I could only laugh at her as she was determined to finish it cause she's a 'G' like that.

We had Blueberry Pancakes and Denver Potato Pancakes Combo, and both items were amazing. The concept, presentation and taste went all above average.

    "text": "Tropicanna, the hotel we were staying in was within walking distance from Cocos and the ratings were high so I figured I would try it.  Upon walking in I was greeted by a awful smell which was extra strong in the restroom  but I figured a bad smell would not discourage me from eating good food.   The atmosphere reminded me of a old diner from the 60 ' s but it was missing the friendly waitress with the pen behind her ear. Instead our waitress was straight to the point not rude but not at all big on conversation.  If I could rate the menu alone I would give it 5 stars everything looked delicious and the descriptions made you think you couldn't go wrong with any of the menu items.   I decided on the mouth watering charbroiled Turkey burger. The burger was a frozen turkey patty and the bread was supposed to be wheat but looked like a regular bun fresh toppings though.  The fries were very thin and not bad but not good either. My friend had the pancakes which she said was ok. The turkey bacon was cooked perfectly I was told.   If you are looking for a cheap breakfast and Dennys is too far of a walk for you this might be your best bet.",

My wife took my sister in law towards Cocos after had been told not to enter hooters and to go to mgm to be safer. The type of vehicles driving up and down Tropicana Blvd was erratic and dangerous  people were being ran over from fleeing the mass shooting. So my wife headed away from the strip towards cocos. A gentleman signaled them to come into enter cocos and they entered. My wife and her sister waited bunkered down in rear of dining rm till my father,mother in law and I reunited. The staff took us in with open arms and any help they could offer they did. They made sure everyone had water and wasn't hurt. The restroom was readily available. They helped us barricade the windows and doors till fbi, sherrifs and paramedic arrived to. Even after the lockdown was cleared we were welcomed to stay as long as we needed. We exited around 2:45am the night of the shooting. I would like to thank the staff on duty at the time  of the mass shooting. They stayed calm cool and collected. Two gentlemen in particular helped out and didn't sit down once through the whole situation except for the one duck and cover we experienced at some point in the night but other than that they worked all through the night to make sure we were safe. Thank you Cocos for hiring such staff. They deserve recognizing honors for the efforts and calm attitudes.  My name is Anthony Felix and I thank you and the staff for giving us shelter. Please pass this on to the staff and just let them know I appreciate them for every thing they did and my family feels the same way",

I would recommend the Gouda and potato hash omelet...potatoes hash is a Coco signature dish made of potatoes, onion, green pepper, mashed potatoes, spices (A-1 sauce), it is fantastic and I would order it again and again.  The meal is served with your choice of bread, potatoes or fruit, huge portions for around $10.  I had some fresh fruit too, which was melon, very good too.",

It's  \"let's eat on the cheap and then go to bed\" food.  The burgers are ok. -try the bacon burger Same with the omelettes - the something Swiss one Avoid the steaks -frozen, under-seared, and chewy I didn't try the pie. But if I did I guess apple would be my goto.  Service was fast and efficient, a short wait it seems if your party is small, and the coffee gets refilled on the fly. My cup never went dry which is service that I like.   For about $20 for two people, it's a fair price for decent food that will make tomorrow's hangover a little more bearable.",

Its a little beat up inside the physical restaurant and feels like a little diner, but was very homey once we settled in. (We love diners but weren't expecting this to be like one)The servings for breakfast were really well sized and the prices were really good considering this place is only 1-2 blocks off the strip. Four of us cost $55. I had eggs, sausage, hash browns and two pancakes. All tasted great and came out on time. The pancakes were delicious. Had the place been in a little better shape I would have considered 5 stars. Food and service were great. Go here for breakfast.",

Save your money for the gambling, clubs, drinks and the nice nights out and grab breakfast or lunch here. Surprisingly extremely fresh food for \"what you should expect\" prices. Fix your hangover with a short walk out of your hotel and grub out, and head RIGHT NEXT DOOR!!! to the liquor store to grab your pregame/to-go drinks for the day. So happy I saw this place out of my hotel window and decided to try it. Between Coco's and the convenient liquor store next door, had to save us $80-$100+ for a 4 night stay. If you know Vegas, you won't think that's an exaggeration",

We were seated and our orders taken relatively quickly. After about 5-10 minutes, another couple was seated near us and their orders taken. 15 minutes later, out came their pancakes, fruit, eggs, bacon, etc! WE STILL HAD NOT BEEN SERVED. Not only had we not been served but our server never came by to give us the word on what was going on, why it was taking so long, nothing! I mean come on, we ordered scrambled eggs and toast!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Another 5-10 minutes went by and we finally had enough, so we just got up and left. The place was giving us the creeps anyway, its dingy as crap inside, crooked lamps, peeling paint, the bathrooms are straight out of hell, and we watched a man picking up garbage outside on his hands and knees walk back into the kitchen, AND NOT COME OUT!!! BELH!!!! What a joke, i'd rather starve than go back to this place.",
