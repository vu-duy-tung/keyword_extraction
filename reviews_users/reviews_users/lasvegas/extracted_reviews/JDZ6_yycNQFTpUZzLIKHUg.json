The waitress Maria was amazing and made some mighty tasty guacamole...This is one of the most expensive Mexican restaurants here for Mexican and the taste isn't that much a difference if you want to over pay 40-50 for a meal. Also FYI if you get a free flan double check your bill cos when we got back to our room I saw we still got charged when it was free apparently.",

Was a little disappointed that it took about 10 minutes to be acknowledged while waiting at the bar (wasn't packed/lots of open seats). The place isn't cheap but the food is organic non-gmo and has a lot of vegan/gluten free options. The guacamole was amazing! So delicious and they come with a cart and make it in front of you! I ordered the cilantro lime cocktail-- I didn't like it but my husband did. It's a nice place to stop for lunch or dinner, with friends or family. The reason I gave it 4 stars was because, when we did sit down at our table, it took a very long time to order our food and we weren't sure who our waiter even was, until we stopped someone to ask.",

The place is pricey for this type of cuisine. It came out to about $87 for two and we only ordered the one drink to share. I confirmed that they were not cooking the grasshoppers on the grill before i ordered. Would not want that!!!! The gothic decor is creatively cool. We will be back if we are in the mood for Mexican food in Vegas. The plus is they are open 24 hours.",

Chef Paco has put together an incredible, authentic menu that he and the staff serves 24/7. Non- GMO and organic ingredients are the rule here, the menus even list the source farms for many of the items. Large selection of vegetarian and GF options - and and the chef is great about making  modifications for vegans (mmm...churros). It's a True Vegas dining gem.   The vibe and  decor are great and the staff is super friendly. Be sure to check their web site or Facebook page for all of the great specials they offer though out the week. Chances are if you stop here once, you'll find yourself becoming a regular.  The private room is great for groups, I had a dinner for 40 and everyone loved the food and service. They personalized our menus and really made the night special.   It's also a great location for dinner before a Las Vegas 51s baseball game. Loving the Veggie Bowl with a house margarita! Great service even during the dinner rush. Come to think of it, I'll probably be back after the game too!  If you want to surprise someone by pulling into a Gentleman's Club parking lot when you were to be going to dinner make sure you come around to so you are taking Industrial south and turn into the parking lot - or distract your guest from looking at the building as there is now large lit signage on the street side of the building.",

Throw a dart at the menu from a distance, order whatever meal the dart lands on, and you'll love it.  Everything is great - some of my favorites include: -The house salad, add chicken -The taco plate (the Cochinita is downright the best taco I've ever had) -Chicken lettuce wraps (add the habanero sauce) -Chicken or Mahi signature bowls (makes for 2 meals) -Chilaquiles (you can't beat this breakfast anywhere else in Vegas. This is not hyperbole)  The staff are all super friendly, swift, and thorough. They care about good service and give the place a great energy.  It's hard to find a non-GMO, organic eatery in Vegas. In fact, one of only two of them I know of. There's not much of a market for it in this city; the locals and tourists here aren't particularly discerning when it comes to their food. But for those of us who care, this place is like a sanctuary. A food sanctuary.   I'll really miss this place. Come to Portland El Dorado Cantina!",

The bar has happy hour specials from 12am-2am. Street tacos for $2.50 each. The carnitas are pretty good. Not dry and not over salted. The Chips and salsa are also good, especially the red sauce, but only the first basket is free. All refills are $3.50. Definitely a surprise at how classy this place is considering it's open all night and next to the club. It's worth the visit. Only about 3 minutes off of the strip.",

We came here after going to Drai's so we were all a bit drunk already. And drunk + mexican food = bliss! The restaurant itself was pretty empty but that might just be because of the time we were there at. They were blasting a shakira concert on the TV's which we LOVED! I ordered the carnitas burrito which came in a pretty decent portion especially for the prices. I must say. The star of all of our dishes though, was the rice. Omg that was literally the most amazing rice I'd ever had! And I'm chinese so I've eaten plenty of rice in my lifetime! The rice was just so fluffy and BUTTERY! It was to die for! I can't get over just how amazing it was!  For dessert, we ordered the free flan for checking in on yelp. It was so rich and creamy! Decadent to say the least!   I'm not joking about the rice though! My sister went back to vegas a couple weeks later and I had her bring me back an order of that rice no lie!",

Salsa that accompanied a huge portion of chips was really good not that watered down flavorless crap that a lot of restaurant serve.  My bf got the Ghost chili margarita, which he loved but was very spicy for him (he's Indian so that's saying something!!!). Appetizers were tasted and looked good. Fried ice cream was great but prefer when fried ice cream is served warm/fresh out of the fryer. The waiter was attentive, friendly, and professional.   This place is attached to a strip club (not inside).  Only down side is I feel like it is over priced.",

So we pulled into the lot, apprehensive, it's located next to a giant strip club, it's open 24 hours, never good signs.  To say we were pleasantly surprised is an understatement, we were downright shocked, El Dorado Cantina probably has some of the best Mexican food we have ever eaten, and I mean ever. The tacos were rich and flavourful with complex taste profiles, the tortillas were fluffy with such an amazing texture that I didn't believe they were all gluten free, really it was the best meal we've had on our Vegas trip and that includes the super fancy places by famous chefs that charge hundreds of dollars per head. I want to go back as soon as possible and make my way down their whole menu.",

The room is lovely with a cool Day of the Dead decor. The service was first rate. Christela our server was very nice and accommodating about our food questions. Doris the manager took the time to speak with us and let us know about specials during the week such as industry Monday and tequila Tuesday. Of course the food is the most important part of any room. This is really good food. The menu offers some typical Mexican fare such as burritos and enchiladas but also some specialties that I have never seen before. The menu is coded with symbols for heat, vegetarian, gluten free and house specialty. Our entree choices were all delicious. They are open 24 hours and do have a small breakfast menu. They also have a nice sized bar. It is in a perfect spot for strip casino workers to go after shifts. Try it you'll like it.",

    "text": "This is one of those times when I wish Yelp would let us rate the service separately from the food.  Let me say the food is five stars and the margaritas, well I don't believe I've ever had better.   However....  We had made our reservation through Yelp which was something new but I thought a really great idea.  Made the reservation And received an email confirmation as well as the reservation on my phone in the app and a reminder the day of.   Seemed efficient. Got to the restaurant which is right next door to a mens club which makes it easy to get a taxi back. Walked in, the hostess couldn't find our reservation and said Well, she'd find us a table. Manager was all upset because it wasn't there. I looked down at the reservations on her tablet, there was my name. One star gone for idiocy and a less than stellar table when We planned ahead.   Got water right away, a real plus because you usually have to ask for it and the server appeared soon after with chips and three salsas. The tomatillo was the best I've had in ages. He took drink orders and then it was probably 15 minutes before we saw him again. I ordered grilled shrimp tacos, hubby cheese enchiladas. Quite a long time before we were served, ate all the chips and no one offered to refill them. Food arrives by a runner, no server in  sight. Hubby was supposed to,have cheese, got chicken.  No server in sight for 15 minutes or so.  Rather than go hungry hubby ate the chicken Ones, said they were good but not what he wanted. Server finally shows up, surprised the food was incorrect and can he replace them. Where was he when the food was served.  Lost a star for that as well.  In spite of the service missteps, the food and drink,were excellent and worth more than three stars.  The place was very noisy.  Apparently they were having some contest and because of being seated where we were it was impossible tocarry on a conversation until the contest was over.  We come to Vegas a lot and will probably go there again since it's organic and just to see if this was a one time lack of service.",

When we first got there they seated us at a booth that was absolutely filthy. Then they moved us to another booth where the seats were full of grease but we stayed then they told us we couldn't have happy hour in the booth we had to go to the bar. when we went to the bar the bar told us that we could have happy hour in the booths no one seems to know what was going on there. Finally after sitting at the bar for 20 minutes the bartender took our food order. But there's one good thing about the restaurant the food  The chef needs to move out of that restaurant and go to someplace where he'll be appreciated at. Because the service at this restaurant is abominable. oh and to top it off the $5 margaritas that were on for happy hour we were charged $11.00 for but we didn't say anything feeling that we never come back here again.

That brewing said, certainly not the most family friendly of locations...we gave them a shot seeing as it was just the wife and I. Stepping in right around 5:30 p.m., we were seated without any wait. A quick look through the menu drew immediate attention to the inflated prices throughout the food and drink selections. I suppose it's to be expected in Las Vegas, but their off-strip location would've suggest otherwise. Chips and salsa came out in due time, and we ordered the tableside guacamole after reading the rave reviews. The guac was flat out spectacular; a huge offering, perfectly seasoned, fresh ingredients, and definitely one of the best I've ever had. With the complimentary chips, salsa, an order of guacamole, and a pitcher of perfect Margarita, we were near full, and ended up splitting a Carnitas burrito. The burrito came out already cut in half, and strangely enough some differences were noticed. My half was scalding hot, an obvious microwave job. My wife's came out luke warm, and almost seemed to be prepared differently. We almost questioned whether or not they cut our burrito and someone else's, swapped halves, and sent them out. Either way, my half was solid. Quality ingredients, excellently seasoned, tasty carnitas...my complaints would be they didn't use a burrito tortilla...more of a wrap, and it was microwaved until scalding. Hard to deny the flavor, and some of the quality food and drink we enjoyed. Bottomless  line, keep the kids at home, bring your appetite and checkbook. Solid Mexican food a bit off the beaten path.",

We've eaten here at many different times in the day and the service and food are consistent every time we've gone. We have gotten many different dishes, but I would highly recommend the guacamole, because I love that they make it at the table, and also the fajitas! This past time we went was on a Tuesday night because we thought they would still have 50% off for industry night. We learned that they had ended that just a couple weeks before :( but at least they still have the Monday locals deal so we weren't mad! We decided to check in on yelp to get the free flan. I heard their flan is good but me and my boyfriend are personally not fans of flan, so our server (I forgot his name) said he could switch it to something we might like and we decided to get the churros. And they were AMAZING! We love this place and always highly recommend it!",

Yes, it was totally weird driving into a strip club parking lot with my parents. And the waitress wear bustiers and booty shorts, but you get over it immediately after your first round of drinks. Our waitress had to be the loveliest woman in Vegas. She even brought the chef out after our meal  to meet us and arranged for the staff to sing to my sister (who pretended to be embarrassed but we totally know she loved it). And to top off the atmosphere the drinks and food are insanely good. No one walked away unhappy -- and we were beyond full. Hard for the bottomless pit crew we have. Overall, jump into a cab or your rental car and treat yourself here. If I can pull into a strip club parking lot with my parents, you can do it. Have a laugh and enjoy a great meal!",

Myself and a group of co workers came there for lunch before a meeting. We expressed to the waitress Ericka, that we would like the bills to be brought out right after our food is delivered. We sat there, 15-20 minutes and we waved down a different waiter to have them remind our waitress for our bills. She finally came with our bills. I handed her cash and my card and specifically  advised her to apply the cash to my bill first and then use my card for the remaining amount.      As I checked my statement, the full amount was charged to my credit card. This looks as though she may have pocketed the cash. (we had a nice sized group and gratuity was charged). I am not pleased with this service.",

First, let's discuss the location: it's RIGHT next to the strip club...like, in the same building.  This is amazing.  Amazingly hilarious.  Did you know that the dancers order from El Dorado and they deliver to their dressing room?  Amazing.  The food is on point and very affordable.  Less than strip prices, more than a taco shop - it's *just right.*  They USED to have half off for locals every Monday, but now that's a thing of the past. :(   Their margaritas are great - no stock sweet and sour, everything is made in house.  The carne asada is yum, the lettuce wrapped tacos are surprisingly delicious and filling, and their trio of salsas is SO legit.    Whether you're stopping in after a trip to the strip club...or just having a leisurely dinner on a Tuesday night, El Dorado has you covered!",

We ordered tableside guac and my friends ordered a few drinks. The guac was easily the BEST guac we have ever had. It was extremely fresh and the flavors were perfect. It was the right amount of spicy. I still dream about that guac sometimes LOL.   My friends got sangria, strawberry mojitos, and a margarita which they said was the best they have ever had as well.   I ordered the Carne Asada Burrito and got it chimichanga style (deep-fried). It was a very large burrito and could have been shared by two people. I really enjoyed it and would definitely get it again. My friend got shrimp and steak fajitas and thought they were really good too.  For dessert, we checked into Yelp and got 2 free flans (2 check-ins) and it was also amazing.   The waiters then escorted us to the club next door for free which was awesome.   Would definitely come back for that guac if I'm ever in Vegas again!",

I told my fiance I had a new place to try for date night and you could imagine his confusion/excitement when Google Maps took us right to the front door of The Sapphires Gentlemen's Club...  Once he got over the fact that we weren't going to have naked women dance on our laps he led me into El Dorado.  When we walked in the place was pretty empty besides one or two other small groups but when the Host found out we didn't have a reservation she told us it would be a fifteen minute wait? I was truly confused due to how open it was but before I could protest she offered us a seat at the bar since there was no wait and it was happy hour, and I do love a good happy hour!  Our bartender was nice and quick to get us a couple $5.00 Margaritas (strong and decent sized for happy hour pricing).  You have to try their street tacos. There's no other option in my opinion. $2.00 per taco for happy hour and they are so packed full of gorgeous flavors and so full of meat, they were a steal for that price!   Between the both of us we tried the chicken, carnitas, and al pastor street tacos.  Chicken- 5/5 Al Pastor- 5/5 Carnitas- 15/5  Best carnitas taco I have ever had! Probably in my life and I've lived basically steps away from TJ.  I would have gotten another round but my tummy was to filled with Margaritas and Carnitas for even one more bite!  We will definitely be returning for happy hour!",

I mentioned how bad it would be whether I sat at the bar or the table. Frequenting the bar to try and be close to someone to get served quicker. But constantly being worse. Today was different. Ostean and Jazz have made a huge difference here. I come very often and I'm not afraid in this review to give praise to these two. I'm not one to talk down and throw people under the bus. But to shout people out Ostean and Jazz are amazing! Their service compliments Chef Pacos food . They'll definitely have me coming back if not just the food. I was hesitant at first to go from two stars straight to five. Was going to give a four. But fck it five stars it is. Hats off to you two!",

It's a bit strange when you first pull up and it is attached to the same building as the worlds largest strip club.  Make sure you go into the right door fellas. LOL When we walked in m, the service was great, the vibe was cool and seemed like a cool place to eat. Off the beaten path and felt like we found a secret spot. The chips and salsa were perfect. All of us enjoyed our meal. Chicken and steak fajitas were huge no shorting you on meat like other Mexican restaurants. I got the chicken Feinstein. It was amazing I have never had anything like it. Highly recommended and was the managers favorite. My only suggestion would be to put a third egg on top of it. Overall it's a must go to when in Vegas.",

We also had the Mexican street corn and they took it off the cob for us so that we could share. I highly recommend that, the best I ever had.  Everything was flavorful,  great spices and freshness.  The pozole was also very good,  large lots of pork and hominy. Huge menu. Would definitely make this a regular stop on my trips here.",

Service was great.. they were quick with the chips and salsa as soon as we sat down and got started on our drinks right away.  The veggie burrito was amazing. I was not expecting it to be that good.. everything was cooked perfectly and I was full off of just eating half of it.. great portion size. The rice is also very good... and it's rice! How can rice make it onto a review lol   To our server Juan, thank you for an excellent evening. Until next time!",

It is just funky enough to be cool & hip with big screens so you can watch sports. Ok, enough about that...how about the food? I applaud this restaurant, they are Non GMO and source their food  from sustainable farms. Our server was very pleasant & immediately brought us fresh chips & 3 kinds of salsa. Debby ordered guacamole which was prepared fresh table side and delicious. We shared steak quesadillas & queso fundido. Our friends had the mole combination platter that could have fed the table.

Glad I had read the reviews prior to prepare my family about the location.  Same parking lot and building shares wall with a gentleman's club.  But did not feel that effected our experience.   El Dorado definitely had a Vegas unique Mexican feel to it.  We started with he table side guacamole that was TDF!  So flavorful.  Yummy homemade chips and salsa.  Can definitely get full with that!  We ordered and share the steak/chicken fajitas and the shrimp/chicken enchiladas both with a very tasty green sauce.  The steak was so tasty.  We really enjoyed the food, ambiance of the restaurant and our server. Definitely coming back here when in Vegas!!!!",

The restaurant itself neighbors a strip club, yes, but don't let that freak you out. Between the great service( shout out to Christian and Neil!) and the amazing food, this place works wonders. Chef Pacos' flan was amazing, and when he (yes, the executive Chef)came and introduced himself to our table he informed us that it was his Grandmas' recipe- how unique and great is that!? Order that flan, then thank me later)  Do yourself a huge favor and request to sit in Rorke's section. That guy is dedicated, positive and his knowledge on the food was truly impressive. If you're lucky enough to have him as your server, you'll get a lot of great suggestions that will satisfy your Mexican cuisine craving. Go here! It's muy delicioso.",

    "text": "My boyfriend is Mexican, ergo his standards of Mexican food are understandably high. To our delight, El Dorado Cantina has exceeded both our expectations both times we've visited in the last month.  I cannot emphasize enough that the food here is beyond 10/10. Do not let the gluten free/GMO free promotional aspect taint your vision, if that's what the thought of \"healthier\" food does to your foodie appetite. We have ordered a variety of food from all over the menu- Mexican corn, imperial shrimp (oh my wow!), aguachile, milanesa tortas, carne asada burritos, shrimp tacos, flan, tres leches, agua fresca, pineapple margaritas...and not to forget the ever so fabulous gratis chips and salsa to start (make sure you request the habanero salsa if you dig spicy). Everything is FANTASTIC. Hot, fresh, super flavorful. Even the sides of cilantro rice and beans are moist and packed with flavor, and we all know how disappointingly bland those traditional sides can be at a Mexican joint.  What knocked off that last star from 5/5 was the fact both times we went, service was a little slow. At one point we had to physically waive down our server as he passed by, which is always an uncomfortable gesture. In their defense, it seems to be a very busy joint regardless of time or day of the week. Nonetheless, we will be back for more soon!",

The host, who was amazing btw, told us there would be a 10 minute wait so we decided to get a drink at the bar. The bartender was very prompt and made us really good drinks. When our table was ready we waited for our server, Enrique, for 10 minutes, but he never came. Instead, Jesus took our apetizer order. We ordered \"chicken sopes\" but got steak ones. The food runner brought our corrected order, and still no sign of our \"server\" ***20 mins later. We decided we would move back to the bar. The bartender was really fast and nice but then messed up in our beans order. Gave us both pinto, even though we ordered black. Enrique delivered our food and said \"I see you guys moved from my section, that's not nice,\" trying to be funny!! I replied \" sorry did you take my app order?\" And he was like \"no, that was my boy Jesus\" I was like \"oh, because no one ever came back.\" At that point I lost faith on this place. Kai was really good but I just can't get over the server. We were so excited after the amazing reviews, but we will not be coming back.",

    "text": "Decent Mexican food -- COOL that the place is open 24/7!!!   While I don't think I'll ever be there at 3AM, it's nice to know that it's available.  For being well off the LV Strip, I think the prices are quite high, especially compared to the portion of food.    After seeing the prices in the menu, my friend & I assumed the portions would be large so we skipped any appetizers and just got entrees, plus ate the chips & salsa, which they were a little slow in re-filling -- one of those deals where they're somehow oblivious to the chips & salsa bowls being empty as they walk by you, but do notice your alcoholic drink being empty and eagerly ask if you want another one.   They did the same with my iced tea -- free refills seems to mean you've got to take the initiative to stop a server & ask for a refill at this place.   Obviously, the strip club on the other side of the wall makes a profit by charging customers extremely high prices for drinks, but in-return, the customers get to see naked women -- plenty of customers find fair value in that.  But the Mexican restaurant-side of the wall somehow thinks they can use a similar pricing scheme, despite no windows looking into the strip club or any special ambiance -- Both places are located in a rather grimy & seedy section of Vegas.    I was still a little hungry when we left.  It's not cool to leave a restaurant after paying decent $$ for a dinner and immediately having to think about getting more food somewhere in a couple hours...    The only things that make this place interesting & possibly worth a visit are that it's open 24/7, and that it's built into the side of the Sapphire strip club, so at times, perhaps often, there's one or more strippers/cocktail servers/hostesses there taking a break or getting food before/after their work shift for immature/desperate guys (yeah, me too!) look at.  Sorry kids, the strip club has a totally separate entrance, so you're not going to see any boobies.       PLENTY of better (overall value, flavor, ambiance) Mexican restaurants around, but if you're a 'people-watcher,' this place may be fascinating to dine at around 2-4AM, assuming some of the strip-club clientele leave that place with any $$ left.",

My 87 year old mother discovered it from the Food Channel. I am so happy she did.  I will recommend El Dorado. It literally was the best Mexican food I have ever had. The food is fresh, tasty, savory, hot, textural...I could go on and on. Oh, and presentation, wondrous.  Chef Paco arrived after dinner with a parting gift. It was a delicious creamsicle like concoction, served with fresh fruit, orchids in a frozen hollowed out orange. Why yes, thank you Chef!  I will never go to Vegas again and not visit El Dorado. BTW, it's next to a strip club. Didn't bother me, nor should it you.  Sit in Grace's section. She is lovely, happy to help and very pleasant. I can't say enough about how much we enjoyed her service.  Until the next time, I'll be dreaming of the shrimp burrito...",

Very clean and a nice decor.  The staff was very friendly.  The food, just OK.  I would not return.  I wish after that we had gone with out original decision but and ate elsewhere, but it is what it is.  The food was good, just not what the hype is all about, I am surprised about all the 5 star reviews.  We did not have breakfast food we had regular dinner entree, food was a bit dry, not much green chile etc, We dine out a lot, and again perhaps the ambiance and they hype of the evening makes it better?  Not sure, but there are far better places in my opinion.  Close to the stip, about a $8 Uber ride one way.",

    "text": "I can't believe the high marks this place received. I honestly don't know why. The food was below average; filled with cilantro and cumin in quantities that would make anyone gag.   I can't emphasize it enough - MEXICAN FOOD IS NOT ALL CUMIN AND CILANTRO.   The waiter prepared guacamole table-side. He had bowl fulls of cilantro, and all sorts of other stuff. When I asked him to leave 90% of what he brought out, he took some offense. He said that it wasn't the way they made it in Mexico. Well, considering I've made guacamole (and have ordered guacamole) in a few hundred places all over Mexico - I'm thinking he was referring to the Mexico where his neighborhood Taco Bell is located.  And while I'm at it - let's discuss guacamole. I know the hipster foodie trend is to throw mango chutney, cumin, cilantro, lime, raisins (yes, I've seen raisins) in guacamole. That's not guacamole - that's a mess. Guacamole is EXCRUCIATINGLY simple: Avocado. Tomato. Onion. A touch of fresh garlic. If you're feeling up to it...a touch of green chili (ortega or japapeno). NO LIME. Doesn't need it.   There is no flavor more sublime than avocado. Add lime (tartness) and you're changing the character of the avocado. Why do you have to change it? Of course, I'm also going to hear \"but it keeps the guacamole from turning brown\". Use the avocado pits after you make the guacamole - they keep the avocado from turning brown already...but don't use lime or lemon. Please, don't ruin your avocado. It's expensive enough as it is. Be kind. Keep your guacamole simple and fresh.  Let's get a little more detailed, shall we? I learned to make mole (moh-leh) from my mom - who learned from her mom, who learned from her mom, etc. You have to use unsweetened chocolate in the recipe - not semi-sweet or even \"dark chocolate\". Unfortunately, that's exactly what this place uses - semi-sweet chocolate in their mole. Don't bother with the mole. For lack of a better word...it sucks.  Going back? Never. It just isn't worth it. Too expensive for someone's idea of what Mexican food is supposed to be.",

    "text": "Honestly I don't seek out organic or non-GMO restaurants but it's nice to have this option.    My friend was in town who loves Mexican food but not a breakfast person.  Where do we go at 9:30 in the morning? El Dorado that's open 24 hours.  Plus I enjoy the shock factor of it being connected to a strip club.  Kinda freaks people out.  Walking in during the morning hours give you your choice of seating.  We sat in a clean and comfy booth to enjoy our meal.  Service was great.  Our waiter was so funny and very attentive.    Chips and salsa were brought out immediately for a good starter.  The green and red salsa have great flavors.  I probably chowed down on way too many chips.  Of course that wouldn't stop me from ordering the combo fajitas of chicken and shrimp.  The sizzling skillet is generously filled with meat and veggies.  The chicken and shrimp have a good flavor with much leftover to take home.  Since I am a fan of heat, I asked if they had hot sauce.  Strangely they have none to offer.  Their option is their habanero salsa.  The fact that I have to pay extra for this was another oddity.    Now my friend ordered the Queso Mexicano tacos.  She immediately mentioned how spicy the taco was and didn't see any indication on the menu that these had a flare.  I was thinking to myself ~ she's from the midwest and just can't handle a little spice.  I was wrong.  She had me take a bite and my mouth was on fire.  We asked the waiter about the spice and he didn't know that they were supposed to be spicy.  After his chat with the kitchen he found out the pepper oil in the sauce gave it extreme heat.  Yikes!  If you can handle the heat then this is fine.  Otherwise douse the taco in sour cream to even out the flavor.  The habanero salsa tasted like mild after that.  It does help their dishes are served with their amazing rice.  Maybe just a hint of cilantro which doesn't bother me.  The rice is light with a buttery flavor that you can't hate.    With the Yelp check in you receive their famous Flan.  Certainly this is the best flan I've ever had.  It's the perfect little creamy dessert to finish a meal.    The hours are definitely convenient with great service.  In my opinion they are a bit pricey for mexican food but I won't shy away from visiting again.",

Which was 4 tacos, 1 salmon bowl, and one fajita.. beans and rice were cold, wrong tortillas, missing drinks, and on and on but not going to ramble. They kept blaming it on a party of 30 that showed up last minute. Just trying to hurry and leave now so hand them a card, wrong stuff on the bill, still sitting here waiting on it to be corrected 20min later. Long enough to write this book. Not a clue how they ever received all the awards they did",

We didn't come in expecting too much, but was pleasantly surprised with the friendly and fast service.  We got the tableside guac - which was yummy! We  also ordered the beef empanadas and they were really good.  Our entrees were beef enchiladas and the carnitas street tacos. The quality of the food here is amazing! Our servers kept checking in on us and made the whole experience memorable.  Their drinks here are nice and stiff too if you opt to get a margarita ( pineapple).  They have 50% off for locals on Mondays - so check em' out! Their executive chef - Paco is super friendly! I wish more restaurants were like them! It is truly a gem!  DON'T FORGET TO GET THE FLAN! -- IT IS TO DIE FOR!",

    "text": "I haven't had Posole this good since I visited New Mexico and Colorado. It packs such a heavy flavor. The street tacos (I had the Al Pastor) were absolutely amazing with cliantro and lime infused rice.   I also tried the Red Sangria (I know, not a Margarita?) and I can't wait to just get a pitcher of it next time.   But what really impressed me was the Flan. Hands down the best flan I've had. It was light and yet so creamy. Not too sugary but just enough to satiate and satisfy.   Tiffany was serving my boyfriend and I and she was so nice. Exemplary service.   Chef Paco table touched us and the pride he took in his menu is commendable. Homemade recipes he's willing to share and I respect the time he took to talk with us.   We will be back and we're bringing friends with us. :)",

We came in with an open mind and a craving for Mexican food. Ordered our appetizers; nachos and shrimp taquitos. The nachos were so dry we might of as well just ordered chips and salsa, I will give them a gold star for the shrimp taquitos they were amazing and they are served with plenty of guacamole.  After the appetizers we ordered our meals; I had the carnitas tacos which had so many dry pieces it felt like chewing on beef jerkey. My other half ordered a chicken burritos chimichanga style, it looked and tasted like a giant hot pocket. There was no exquisite flavor in either meal, I asked for the salt and pepper to add some pizzazz to the meal. No love was given to making the meal",

I get that they are trying to make the food appeal to the masses but Mexican food has distinct flavors and wonderful spices. It was like eating at an upscale Taco Bell. So disappointing.",

The hostess Martine got me a booth by myself even though the place was full. My waitress was Grace and she did a great job - her table side guacamole was awesome. I almost filled up on that and the chips alone.  My chicken fajitas could have fed two people - there was so much chicken.  Everything tasted great.

Halved pineapple with the shrimp, onions cheese and a ton of green peppers inside a nice broth. It was way too spicy for me but the actual taste was good. I was looking forward to sinking my teeth into a tasty chunk of pineapple but there were NO pineapple chunks inside the pineapple. I was a little saddened by this. I ordered an ice tea and I'm not sure if it was supposed to be flavored or not but even after I squeezed the lemon into it it tasted like toilet water. I opted to drink my plain water instead. My smile was promptly brought back though by the cilantro rice and mouth watering flan. Two thumbs up there. Tiffany, our bartender/waitress was very friendly and pleasant.  It was an overall nice experience but we will probably opt for a different Mexican restaurant for our next south of the border craving.",

You decide how much heat you want in your guac just like in your life so if you like it Muy Caliente like you like your women or men get a 10!  Now the flan. Ohhh the heavenly flan. It's like a hybrid between a nice rich cheesecake with the nice caramelized finish of flan without even a hint of egginess. If you like creme brulee this is like a thicker version with liquid caramel.  Oh yes and Chef Paco came out to talk to us.  Got to love that! Sorry to my friends stuck back in VA, it's his grandma's recipe and I'll bet it stays in the family.  UPDATE: the guacamole made me get sick. Also, or waitress tried to pull a fast one over on us! She brought our check which showed $14 then took the credit card and charged $24!!!!!!! We had to get them to fix it and they returned with the receipt but no credit card.

    "text": "I originally started this review almost 2 years ago and never got around to posting it...  Their pozole is delicious, the table-side guacamole is flavorful and delicious and also large enough to be a meal in itself along with their 3 salsas, their mole was a massive portion of 3 moles and they were all very good. The ingredients all seem very fresh and the flavors of those are very good.  Over the last 2 years though and trying more menu items, the food has selective things that are good, but some things, for example, like their buttered rice, is just gross. I've never had buttered rice at any Mexican restaurant or by any family in my entire life. I could just have never experienced it, but it's bad and overpowers everything if it's by itself or in a burrito.  They try to have integrity with their ingredients by offering grass-fed beef, free range and organic meats, and all organic everything else. But with that in mind I think some of it should be a bit better and more impressive if they go the extra mile to get it all organic. It should also be highly advertised all over their menu for their own benefit, otherwise it looks like they are massively overcharging for pretty much all of their food. Especially because their locals discount and their happy hour has gotten far worse.  Also the newest bad thing is the graveyard Manager. She is absolutely AWFUL. She is downright rude and unpleasant and easily could turn people away from the business permanently, us included. She treats people with massive disrespect and she handles problems atrociously.   Short version:  Positive things: some of the food like pozole, table-side guac, and mole are good, and the bar staff are amazing! It's great that they are 24 hours also.  Negative things: the manager at night is AWFUL, it's pretty overpriced with not super impressive food overall. Atmosphere has gotten worse because they're not as busy anymore.  This place has so much potential but they're just not delivering.",

We had an issue while dining here which is the reason for the lack of stars given.  When our server brought out the food rather than placing the plate in front of me he handed me the plate.  It was so frickin hot that I burned the inside of my thumb and two of my fingers.  I had my hand on the glass of ice water for the remainder of the time we dined.  The pain lasted for several hours and the next day I discovered a blister on my thumb.  Our server was very apologetic and offered to buy us some flan to make up for the mistake, but my husband and I were full and neither of us like flan.  It would've been nice had all or a portion of the check been comped, but that was not an option provided.  The total bill came to $38.93 (see pic of items ordered).",

Chicken Milanesa is seriously legit, very unhealthy and very good.    The biggest problem is the mamalukes who work here. Out of my 10 visits or so I'd say the service was awful 8 out of 10 times. One time we sat at the bar in front of the bartender for almost ten minutes and he never said a word to us.. figured he was a barback. Then another couple walked in and the guy could not have been friendlier to them .  Was one of the strangest Encounters in a restaurant  I've ever experienced. The staff is constantly rotating I've only seen one guy the whole time that I've been coming here that's still there everyone else is always new each time. However, for 24 hour Mexican food that's organic and non-GMO I'll continue coming back and paying the extraordinarily high prices and enduring the shitty service because overall there is some really good things on the menu. AND great chips and salsa. Lastly, I want to mention even though some dishes are average everything is high quality ingredients.",

Service was always good, today included. Go ahead, remove my ROTD; I'm ashamed to have it in my catalogue of reviews, please remove it from existence.   Today's visit: cold taco meat and room temperature rice that I have to now pay extra for when ordering the \"street tacos\". All three meat fillings (carne asada, chicken and pork) in all three tacos were cold; not acceptable. I can already feel the meal trying to explode out of my intestine not even 30 minutes later. That's called food poisoning folks; not grasping the side of the toilet praying to Jesus kind of food poisoning, but food poisoning nonetheless.   Prior visit: same god damn shit...cold food! Service with a smile...because they aren't cooking it and have no clue.   Prior prior visit: real knock you on your ass for 2 days straight kind of food poisoning, or I was roofie'd by the bartender. Yes, praying toilet-side for my life to end occurred after this visit.   I'm done spending 30 bucks for cold tacos and one beer. You should be too. 2 remaining stars because the decor is nice, servers are nice...and there are naked women next door who are out of my league.",

I ordered the shrimp burrito which was quite a hefty size. I really had my eye on the Chapulinos (grasshoppers) and Aguachiles but my stomach isn't that flexible and I didn't want to put my body (you know which part) at risk just in case it was spicier that I am used to. The shrimp burrito was great and everything was spread out evenly which helps! I would definitely recommend and can't wait to return for drinks at the bar;) UPDATE I got a free dessert and it was SO GOOD and beautiful. He was even kind enough to take a picture with our volleyball team! Thank you chef!!!",

    "text": "The frozen mango margaritas are the best in town!  I experienced the fruit in the flavor and texture of the drink as I imbibed shreds of mango in my margarita, and where else in town can you get a plate of chapulines--grasshoppers cooked in your choice of garlic and butter or habanero and lime--to compliment your drink?!?  To make this appetizer even more tantalizing, it isn't even on the list!  Your server has to deem you worthy of an offer, i.e., your Mexican girlfriend chats him up with anecdotes from her summer vacations in Guayavitos, and he knows you're paisa.  The jumbo shrimp and the cactus tacos, which my senorita and I had, were also delicious, but I found the prices a bit high.  A plate of three cactus tacos with a side of rice and beans, a plate of six jumbo shrimp with rice and beans, a bottle of Pacifico beer, a frozen margarita and a plate of grasshoppers cost $85--with tip, $101.  Rice and beans are available for an extra charge, but they should be standard on any Mexican plate.  Judging by our order, though, I assume all other items on the menu are exquisite.  The sugar skull mural at the entrance is one of the most artistic greetings to any locale in town.  The lighting and decor are warm, sensual and authentic.  It was a pleasure to hear a blend of baladas, boleros and rock en espanol as played in videos through satellite TV.  Locals receive a 25% discount on Mondays so I will definitely be back to try something new despite my swing-shift schedule as El Dorado is open 'round the clock!",

Don't get discouraged because it is next right to Sapphires gentlemen club- because it is fantastic and once you are inside you completely forget who it neighbors. Went here for lunch with my sister and it was pleasantly surprised. We got a pitcher of the raspberry margarita (WOW) and the cheese appetizer. We intended on ordering much more but the appetizer portion was so big we didn't have room for anything else! We also ordered some of the house guacamole (YUM) and the mexican corn (super yum) I wanted to try this place bc they advertise as organic and non-gmo, and you can tell their use of fresh quality ingredients but how amazing everything tastes. I look forward to going back next time I am in Vegas. A *must* go.   Note for locals, on Monday afternoons if you show your state ID you get a discount off the total percentage of your bill.",

    "text": "Came here on a last minute adventure with friends a few nights ago. The restaurant itself IS connected to Sapphire strip club, but don't be frightened they are completely separate.   Loved the interior, very intimate. Dark lighting, red walls, rounded booths, old school, but still classy. You could come here for a date (LOL) or simple as we did to casually enjoy the food. They have large flat screens all over the restaurant & they play pretty good music (specifically, they had a Michael Jackson concert playing that night).  The service was prompt w/ chips and two kinds of salsa. Green medium, I'm assuming it's a green tomatillo base and a red hot, tomato or Chili base. If you're into hot foods, both aren't even that hot. Friends got a michelada & a Patron silver margarita. He originally wanted a special drink, but the server was polite enough to ask what was in it because the bartender wasn't sure & suggested a different drink because they didn't have the exact ingredients (no simple syrup, but agave syrup FYI). That's a plus one in my book instead of the bartender whipping up your favorite drink the wrong way, & having it taste bad.  Friends ordered a shrimp appetizer with 4 pieces of bacon wrapped shrimp that was deep fried with a filling, not sure was it was, but it was good. And it came with a creamy, chipotle sauce. Hubby & I ordered a sizzling queso plate with chorizo that was topped with pico de gallo, grilled peppers & onions. Tortillas came on the side & we got a mixture of flour & corn. It's pretty much like a deconstructed quesadilla, but it was honestly so good (especially if you love cheese!).  Hubby ordered the Mexican burger which came with a potatoes that were somewhere in between a French fry & a potato chip. They would have tasted better with a little seasoning. His friend & I ordered a carne asada burrito, SO GOOD! He just had meat, cheese, if I recall & I had everything in it: pico de gallo, guacamole & cheese. And my friend had the chicken burrito everything in it as well. All the burrito plates came with this cilantro rice that was so good! The rice is so simple, but you just can't put your finger on what the seasonings are that make it so good!  For dessert we had the Yelp check-in flan. SO DELICIOUS! And just the right size, too because it's so rich & flavorful.  So glad we decided to come there that night. The food was delicious, the company was great. Can't wait to go back!  Oh and BTW, locals get 20% off on Mondays!",

Really huge burritos with fresh ingredients. I don't really think of huge chipotle style burritos, chicken quesadillas and taquitos as the quintessential authentic Mexican food but it was good and so hugely portioned that we took half of it home.

Our waitress who was also our bar side guacamole maker was very knowledgeable about this restaurant and even gave us information we never knew about, which is always a plus because we're locals. And we love to eat!  25% off of menu for locals on Mondays. Yes, all day! Another plus about this place is that they were able to accommodate my vegan diet. The manager even stated, \" I'll make the whole thing vegan, even the rice. It will be with brown rice instead, because our cilantro rice has butter.\"  I love it! My veggie burrito made vegan was ok. I didn't like that it had big chunks of squash and zucchini, it kinda over powered the burrito. But I ate half   I don't think I saw a vegan selection for desert. But don't quote me to that because I don't recall looking thoroughly. Overall; yes, I would come here again, maybe this Monday",

    "text": "First you've got to look for the strip club. There's no way to get around it: this trendy, swanky restaurant is connected to Sapphire's Gentleman's club. Yes, they even share the same parking lot, and the entrances are just a few feet apart. It was a bit unnerving at first to see elderly couples and young children heading towards the strip...er, I mean Mexican restaurant.  Ok, so now you have the location down, let's talk about the experience: walking into this place is truly enchanting. The word that comes to mind is sexy: from the silky-satin rose wall decor to the dark wood tones to the sumptuous and inviting leather couches and booths. My aesthetic expectations were certainly exceeded.  My friend and I came here to celebrate Mexican independence day (no, I'm not Mexican, but I do LOVE tequila), and El Dorado was offering free tequila shots every hour on the hour for 24 hours along with food specials. Bonus points for a creative promotion!   We ensconced ourselves on one of the sexy leather couches, and were pleasantly surprised with the annotated menu which indicates which items are designated GF-gluten free, V-vegetarian they indicated their non-GMO mantra. So far, so pleased!   The manager Arianna came over and greeted us, and Chef Paco checked on us as well. I love it when the chef steps out of the kitchen to greet the customers he's serving!  Both of them were quite accommodating, but our server was a bit absent minded. He neglected to deliver our tequila shots at the top of the hour, forgot to return with the limes we'd requested, and didn't really check on us after we tasted our food.  We ordered the tableside  guacamole because it seemed like a good idea. Our server indicated that he was not the type who smiles  (this, after I told him I'd be taking a photograph). I got him to laugh and snapped the picture at the right moment. Unfortunately the guac desperately needed salt, and there was none to be found anywhere near  our table. We were finally able to get some seasonings after we flagged down our server.  I liked the presentation of trio of salsas, but the salsa verde was the only flavor I really enjoyed. The street tacos and the chicken tinga tostadita were lovely in presentation, but the chicken was cold.  I ordered a margarita, and it was made with agave syrup. It was ok, but didn't give me any thrills.  I really want to love this place, and the attentive manager and chef make me want to come back. They're still new, and it's obvious that they need to work out a few minor details with the food, but this place has loads of potential.  5 star decor and a sexy vibe make me want to return.  Next time I'll try the entrees.  Mexican independence day was a success thanks to El Dorado Cantina.   I almost forgot they shared a common wall with a strip club. This place is a refreshing change from the greasy Mexican restaurants.  Please keep up the creative promotions!",

Plus if u need a little retouch on your latin dance moves they got you w/ dance lessons on Tuesdays 6pm-7pm & 8pm-9pm  My recommendation is the tres leches cake & the Imperial Shrimp.

Our server, Jesse, was great and helpful!  Their free chips and salsa actually comes with three different sauces, going the extra mile more than most (be extra careful with the habanero!). Their drinks menu was very varied in terms of cocktails. They even have a handmade juice they'll turn into Margarita!   Our dishes were delicious. Normally I don't care about GMO-free dishes, but everything we ate was nice and fresh, from the Carne Asada to the Torta. Mexican food tends to leave me feeling a bit gross due to all the grease, but you can tell the stuff here is quality.  Even though the venue is a bit odd (right next to a gentleman's club :P), it doesn't detract from the quality of the restaurant. I recommend everyone who likes Mexican to come here. A+!",

There was also live Spanish music, awesome.  First off, you MUST order the table side guac. We ordered it medium spicy and it was delicious. I ordered a jalapeno margarita which was not too spicy surprisingly. As a table we ordered: fish tacos (delicious! try them!), chicken enchiladas (very big in size!), and a special slow roasted pork taco concoction with a banana leaf which my coworker said was the best thing he's ever tasted.   We're probably going back in a few days...  My ONLY complaint (very small) was there was basically no lighting for our table. I don't really enjoy eating in the dark and can't read my menu very well but overall the ambiance and atmosphere of the place was great. EL DORADO FOR THE WIN!",

    "text": "The customer service at this establishment was embarrassingly bad. If I was the owner--or manager--I'd be ashamed of the ladies I have working the hostess desk.   Over the weekend, my family and I were in Vegas and decided to branch off the strip and enjoy some Mexican food. Yelp reviews steered us towards El Dorado which also happened to be a stones throw from our hotel. The confusing part is that the restaurant actually shares the building and parking lot with a strip club. Yup, nothing says 'family atmosphere' like walking through a parking lot full of seedy men and limo drivers before dinner. The entrances are so close to one another, that nobody would even know what establishment you were heading to until placing your hand on the appropriate front door.   The Issue: Prior to even coming here, we called to find out what the wait was like and if a reservation was needed. The employee on the phone stated that \"no reservation was needed,\" but the wait might be 45-60 mins. No problem we thought, we'll enjoy a drink at the bar in the meantime. Upon arriving however, the hostesses informed us that they would not be able to seat us until 10pm (it was currently 5:30pm) without a reservation. What?! The restaurant was virtually empty and we found that hard to believe. After some back and forth, the hostess would not budge. Zero accommodations were given and she was completely rude and snarky through the entire process.   I know your restaurant is highly rated and you probably have quite the following, but your customer service is horrible. I would not recommend your restaurant to anybody and hope you make the necessary adjustments so as to not lose more business.",

We will definitely be back. Oh and if you're an adventurous eater then you need to try the grasshoppers if you're brave enough!",

He was attentive, lively, and he even mentioned the Free Flan coupon on Yelp.   The salsa. Oh my goodness. You can tell it was homemade, and I loved the fire roasted flavors.   We also ordered the Queso Fundido with Chorizo and it was amazing. Creamy, spicy, and piping hot with pico de gallo on top - don't pass this one up! It was delicious, to say the least.  I ordered the Chicken Street Tacos while my wife ordered the Chicken Quesadilla, and both were superb. The chicken was juicy with perfect flavoring and the rice served along side of it was divine.   Last but certainly not least, we got our free flan - and MAN, was it incredible. The chef, Paco, brought it out to us and personally thanked us for coming in. To top it all off, he handed us coupons for breakfast. Talk about top of the line service. In the end our waiter shook our hand and we were off. This place is a real Las Vegas gem. We will absolutely be back.",

For organic food, this is very inexpensive.  the presentation of your food is outstanding.  like in a 4 star restaurant.  they also have two different stevie sweeteners for your coffee or tea.  we had a jalapeno margaritas which was interesting but it wasn't a good match for the food.  they did poor heavy on the alcohol so you got yor $13 bucks worth on just the alcohol  service: went in last night and had Joaquin as our server.  super nice guy.  he noticed that the kitchen messed up and wanted to get us something else.  we said it's not big deal.  there was also a delay on getting the Margarita which wasn't his fault. he brought out flan for free which also turned out extremely delicious.    went in for lunch the next day and was served by Tiffany.   she was the sweetest waitress we have ever encountered in vegas.  she made us feel like family.  she was also super efficient, polite, quick for service.",

    "text": "I recently paid a visit to El Dorado Cantina on a weekend trip to Vegas and man was I so glad I did. The bar was set so high on my last visit I didn't think they could top it but nope, I was wrong, they sure did and then some.  I was with a significantly smaller group this time and elected to sit at the bar. The overall service, experience and food is very much still top notch however this time I was able to sample the table side ghost chili salsa and the jalapeno cucumber margarita.  So let me tell you about both, sitting at the bar I had the honor of being served by the head bartender Tiffany. (If Tiffany is reading this, I'm sorry for misspelling your name, not sure if it is with an \"I\" or a \"y\". The ghost chili salsa is prepared for you table side which in this case was bar stool side. As the restaurant is well known for, the ingredients are extremely fresh and they are very generous with the ghost chili. Tiffany added like 11 chiles I believe and when I saw that she had double gloved I was like in my head what am I about to get myself in for. The end product was fantastic, spicy yes but not as hot as I thought it would be and it was a perfect complement to the food I ordered. Make no mistake this is very hot but if you're a fan of spicy food, you can handle it, c'mon, live a little. On the jalapeno cucumber margarita, Tiffany was very thorough in the preparation and it demonstrated itself in the taste. By far, the best margarita I've ever had. I'm not into sweet cocktail drinks, I'm more of a beer guy but this drink was no cocktail this was a masterpiece. Perfectly balanced, spice, tartness, sweetness and boozy kick. Man, I didn't want that to end. So on Tiffany, she's VERY VERY easy on the eyes (wink wink) so I was pretty stoked I was at the bar and she ended up being my bartender. She put on the Angel game for us too, she's rocked!. Chef Paco, well what can you say, he's the man in Vegas :)  Can't wait to be back!!",

But don't worry, it's a separate business. (That's in case you were worried :)) This is more than a typical Mexican restaurant. It serves ORGANIC and GMO-FREE food which kind of is a big advantage nowadays , cause it is very hard to find that kind of food in Las Vegas. They have options for vegetarians as well. I really like the food seasoning since it is done in right portions.  The Executive Chef is from Mexico City and makes his job in high level.  The service was a little slow, but servers were polite enough not to remark their slowness.The restaurant is open 24 hours. Prices are affordable. This restaurant is not from one of the top but sure worth a visit.",

I come here a few times a month and tonight was so funny ! CNN was on! As the spurs are playing I'm watching Anthony in the Congo ! I asked to change it to the game and the staff politely declined and mentioned management didn't approve of \"sports\".   The music and the horrendous tv for a bar has knocked it to a 3 for me.

I didn't grow up in the Bay Area or Southern California. I grew up in Northwest Indiana. We didn't have the best Mexican food -- although Chicago has some quality spots.   All I know about El Dorado Cantina is they do Mexican food about as good as I've ever tasted.   Every dish I've had (from the stuffed shrimp, Siegel plate, fajitas, table-side guac, and habanero salsa *ask for it*) is bursting with unique flavor. All of the food is organic and non-GMO. The farms from which they source are listed on the menu.   In my opinion, EDC does everything right. They're the future of what a successful business should be: quality, honesty, good customer service, and fair (somewhat) pricing.   EDIT: 4/29/17/  ***  Like many, my original experiences with EDC were wonderful. The last few, however, have been very hit or miss.  Still much of what made EDC special remains, yet, much is changing. Lately, dishes have been served lukewarm, often times cold all together. The sizing/portions are inconsistent  (especially with my go-to: the Siegel plate). The service is generally still pretty great.  I worry EDC might be relying on reputation a bit too much these days. But I'll continue my visits.",

My husband had the pozole soup and carne asada tacos and was super excited about all of it. I had the shrimp tacos-- fabulous. Our waiter was great and the bartender told us they make their own marg mix (which is probably why it's so good). The chef even came out to talk to us and ask if everything was OK. Amazing food and service, no complaints. Oh and when we were driving away, the waiter ran out after us and told us he gave us the wrong bill and accidentally overcharged us-- what honesty!

As a long-standing fan of Mundo Haute Cuisine in the Las Vegas Design Center for the high end and Taco Y Taco for the low end but high quality, I have to admit that foodies should gather up outside a strip club to get Las Vegas's most reliable top quality mexican.  Wow, there.  I said it.  24 hour opening is great.    Only one star deduction for one reason.  Service can be a bit spotty here.  I have been there when 5 different people asked me how things are going in 5 minutes - interrupting conversation and chewing each time (annoyed).  I have also waited to get my order taken way too long on other occasions.  They need to get the staffing right.    Once they do, this place is a rocket ship.  Also - note to management (and I hate to say this as a consumer): we want you to stay in business for a long long time.  Charge $1-2 more for every entree.  With reviews as top quality as this on yelp and everywhere, we are more concerned about your financial stability in the future than your pricing.

Our waitress came and every single word we said to her we had to repeat about 3 times cuz she couldn't hear us. We ordered the night continued and she never came to check on us when we wanted a refill and we waited about 30 mins after eating to get our check cause she and other staff members were no where to be seen on the floor. The bill comes and it's about $57. This place is kinda pricey considering I only had 3 tacos and my boyfriend had fajitas and 2 drinks to our bill. So we leave her a $10 tip, still not worth it but whatever. We left and we are about to get in our car and the waitress comes running out to us saying she forgot to add the $10 fried ice cream we ordered and still made us paid for it . That is THE ABSOLUTE WORST COSTUMER SERVICE EVER . So unprofessional . Me and my boyfriend where so thrown off after that when she could of taken the tip we gave her and paid for it when she forgot anyways. Never coming back again for a date . The managers did nothing about the situation, I wanted my money back . So don't waste your money here. Food is not that great anyways , super over priced .",

We have had a couple of their appetizers and soups all which I would easily order again.   The location is my least favorite not so much that it's next to a strip club just the side of town it's on.

When we asked for cucumber slices instead of chips he said he would have to charge 4$ extra, lettuce cups instead of bun 2$ extra, corn off the cob .. $2 extra, vegetables instead of rice / beans 4$ extra . I told him that I come here all the time. He gets the head chef and he comes out w a huge attitude and makes it clear their will be no negotiating and that I will be charged full price for everything. I felt extremely threatened as he came out and made us both feel uncomfortable and unwelcomed. For a customer who promotes, loves, and spends thousands here, you would think they would notice. I am saddened at what happened as it put a very sour taste in our mouths about it. The prices are already inflated and you want to charge for small adjustments to a loyal customer?

    "text": "With over 2000 near perfect Yelp stars, high expectation comes natural!  After all, El Dorado Cantina is considered one of the best high end Mexican resto in the city. We arrived at 7 p.m., on time for our reservation and despite the restaurant being not busy, we were told to wait an extra 20 mins for our table - no biggie, since they then proceed to seat us on a comfy booth table, overlooking the main dining area of the restaurant. The space was quite spacious, decorated with bold Mexican flair, rather old school, but romantic at the same time - we loved it!   They started us off with a complimentary chips and salsas, and their version of two salsas was truthfully one of the best to date. They are spicy, fresh and addicting! The chips were also crunchy.  For the food the two of us ordered and shared:   * Grilled Steak fajita: I was disappointed with how this dish turned out when it's served to me. I was expecting it would be presented on a hot sizzling skillet, but the meat was cold... Probably, it has been sitting out for a while. The server also fails to bring us the tortillas and the rest of the sides that come with the fajita, that we have to request it TWICE! Other than that slightly big mistake, the flavors were all good!  * Octopus and Chorizo taco: Just one bite of this and I'm done... It honestly tasted horrible, super bland and the octopus was really dry and rubbery, ugh.   * Short rib taco: The highlight of the night! I love short ribs, especially if it's really nicely seasoned and super tender like this one! Definitely one of the most stunning taco I've tried so far.   The service was kinda off; distant attitude, missing orders and as we waited what seems like forever for our food, the waitress hardly ever checks in on us. The food was actually good, but not THAT good that we can look beyond the bad services, lol. Overall, happy to have tried this once, but don't think I will be counting on El Dorado for a splendid Mexican meal in the near future.",

It isn't inside Sapphire--there is a separate entrance.  The margaritas we had were ok but nothing special.    Most of our group of 7 had tacos and one had a burrito.  These were ok but bland.  The rice was really good though.  The big hit of the night was the spicy guacamole, chips and salsa.  These were fabulous.    The service wasn't very good-we we're in a back room and kind of forgotten.  Would I go back?  I would and order a beer and several orders of guacamole!",

Cant go wrong with any of those dishes .... Best part is they are fit meals, high in protein. And I'm obsessed with the fact everything is GMO, Organic, Anti-biotic free. .

    "text": "I grew up in SoCal, have been to all of Rick Bayless's places in Chicago, but NOTHING prepared us for this unassuming \"strip-joint\" looking restaurant!!! We saw it featured on \"Taco Time\", and Aron knows his stuff, so off we went.  The place is actually REALLY nice, but in a kind of \"old-school\" Vegas way. RED!!! If you don't like red you MAY have a problem here! But we started with a few STUPID good margaritas and then the tableside guacamole. O...M...G. Our waiter was one of the best of my 62 year life, but the guac...everything put together in a molcajete, just absolutely perfect. Then I asked his advice on what HE loved, and he did not hesitate- the Cochinita Pibil! If you aren't in Vegas right now just kill yourself and get it over with, because you ain't gettin' THIS stuff tonight! OLD school prep, super tender and perfectly spiced, and not some \"boutique-sized\" portion, this was for a Broncos linebacker! I'm not THAT far off at 6' 4\" and 240, I ate HALF! My wife has some street tacos and they were the same thing, just the best ever.  But all that STILL doesn't prepare you for the dessert! And I don't wanna hear people say \"I never eat dessert\". Well suck it up cupcake, it's FREE (the flan is) if you register on Yelp! See their website for details...but we ended up ALSO getting free Tres Leches Cake, which typically we BOTH hate, mainly because it's never fresh. But this stuff was the BOMB! JUST made before we got it, look at the website if you dare. But the flan...before ANYONE says \"I don't like flan\", my wife is from NY and as much as she likes Mexican food, she has NEVER liked flan. That always made me question why I married her, but maybe it's because she's never had LEGENDARY flan!!! This stuff is TRANSCENDENT! They claim no cheese is used, but it is SO incredibly...almost cream cheesy. Sorry, I'm about to have an accident here but that stuff should come with a warning that you can't eat just one! It is, simply put, the BEST flan on planet Earth, so quit looking elsewhere.  So, are you getting the feeling we liked it?! I'm telling you, we're going back this September for friends from Holland and we're gonna show them what REAL Mexican food is all about. I'm almost glad it's there and not HERE or my 240 would balloon to 400 in a month. OK THAT was a lie, I'd deal with being a very large person...happily. See you amazing people in September with a LARGE group of crazy Dutch people!!!",

    "text": "We came for Mexican Independence Day last night, and we hit a home run!    We had a very large group, and even though they booked another group over us in the back room, they still accommodated us in the front of the restaurant.   The wait staff was pretty good, especially considering the size of our group.   They gave us pitchers of sangria on the tables for free. It was nice, but it was pretty watered down, which made it very light.   They also had complimentary tequila shots on the hour. I think this was for the whole house, and not just for our party.   Towards the end, Chef Paco came out, and greeted everyone. I took a picture with him and then he made me take another one with a Sombrero. Too fun!!  Ok....now for the food...I ate GRASSHOPPERS!!!!   They have them on their appetizer menu, and someone got an order.  They ordered the garlic lime, but there is a habanero version too. I was proud of myself for eating them...I actually thought it was pretty uneventful. I was worried after the crunch, there would be a squish of guts, but there wasn't. It was just crunchy and tasted like garlic lime.    For the rest of my meal, I got the table side Guacamole, which was good. I tasted someone's Shrimp Taquitos and they were delicious. And my main meal was the Mahi Mahi Tacos minus the mango salsa. I put some of my fresh guacamole on them instead. The fish was cooked perfectly and flavorful. Oh yeah...The rice was amazing!!!!  I ate every bit of it, but was too full to eat both tacos.   I will definitely be back!!!! Loved this place!!!!",

    "text": "Took family here for lunch based on tremendous yelp reviews and it was beyond my expectations.   The restaurant has been open less than 3 years, yet it is one of the highest yelp rated restaurants in the country and I understand why.   Let me start by warning you that the entry door is literally side by side with the entry door to a strip club!  The signage for the gentlemen's club dwarfs the signs for this restaurant and can be hard to find if you didn't know this.   The food is authentic, organic, free of GMO, and offers many veggie & gluten free options. The portions are GIGANTIC!  The prices of the entrees shocked me as they are pricey -- in the $18-28 range for many. However, don't be dissuaded from going to this restaurant as each entree can easily be split between two ravenous diners. If you have a light appetite, you might get two more meals from your doggy bag which makes the price a tremendous value.   I had the carne asada, which came out on a huge hot plate with chorizo sausage, two gigantic slabs off tender succulent marinated grilled skirt steak served on top of grilled cactus, a large roasted jalapeno and pepper, and side order of beans and their famous cilantro rice. If you are a beef eater and have a big appetite, this is the dish for you!  The fajitas, tacos, and other entrees were equally huge and expertly prepared.  by checking into yelp, we received a complimentary dessert of flan -- the richest, creamiest flan I've ever enjoyed!    If you are adventurous, the grasshopper taco appetizer consists of 3 large tostadas, roasted grasshoppers, black beans, avocado and Mexican cheese -- delicious and unique!  Didn't try any drinks. Guac was prepared for other diners tableside and looked outstanding.   The service: Our server, Juan, was amazing -- so friendly, knowledgeable, and passionate about the food and service.  So helpful - he even gave us a website to lookat for trip planning to Mexico!  And they are open 7x24!  Will absolutely make a repeat visit here on my next trip through Vegas!",

The street tacos are amazing, u can tell the difference quality meats make. If u wanna step it up to their signature tacos, the Mahi Mahi is smoky goodness, mine were cooked perfectly,  not an easy task with fish. Plenty of parking and comfortable seating. Sit at the bar for happy hour pricing. Don't mind the strip club next door it plays no role on your experience.",

It would be an extra 2 dollars.  No, thanks.  I got the Chicken Milanesa.  Others got burritos and tacos.  Some liked it, most didn't.  Pretty pricey for okay Mexican food.  Finding a taxi was difficult leaving because of all the people wanting to leave next door at Sapphire.  Other than that, eh.  Go elsewhere.",

We also had the shredded beef empanadas and could have eaten at least 10 orders!! Their chips and salsa could have kept coming all night and you cannot go wrong with their signature margaritas! If we lived here, we'd be here every day if we could! And our server Juan was the best! He was polite, knowledgeable, and made amazing recommendations.

    "text": "Let's start by saying this use to be my only place for Mexican. It was top notch. Now it's bottom of barrel.   The food quality was the best. Me and a few friends ate here 2 times a week, faithfully. We loved it.   We made friends with chef Paco, who was very passionate about his food. Honestly I believe he still is, and this my little Yelp minions is where the problem comes to a head.  About 4 months ago one of the guys in the group was escorted out of the restaurant by some goons from the strip club next door. Over what you may ask? A basket of chips. $1.50 basket of chips. We all stayed away for a few weeks, but we eventually returned minus one for this amazing food.   Now you may think my friend over reacted on $1.50 worth of chips but we are talking $150.00 to $200.00 bills 2 times a week easily.  Again no big deal but a customer was removed over 1.50. We returned despite sour attitude from our friend. Now we only went once a week. On a night this particular friend was unavailable.   Fast forward to approximately 8 weeks ago. Myself and two other guys walk into the restaurant and sit down at our normal table. Yes we had a regular table. The server takes our order and makes a comment, to the point of \" Chef saw you and said you were barred, but I should serve you anyway\" to which I replied, you have me confused with the other guy, my friend Mike. We let it go and place our order. We receive our food which is the WORST we have ever received. Everyone at table agrees. But being Business owners ourselves. We also understand that kitchens from time to time have bad days. But it was so bad, we keep reminding ourselves and for 2 months we stay away.   Tonight we return. The food which was MUCH better then last time but still far from the 100% it use to be was served. The meal was finished. We are looking over the check and there is a charge for 1.00 to upgrade to flour tortillas. I ask the waiter why, he says the kitchen says they cost more then corn, and grabs the check and runs away. We grab a menu and check the fajitas out. I ordered steak which is 26.50. It says clearly on the menu, fajitas are served with onions, peppers, rice, beans......blah blah blah and your CHOICE of corn or flour tortillas. No where dose it state 1.00 extra for flour. So again I engage the waiter to point this out. Who no doubt is disgusted and claims to not understand it himself. He said \" any enemy of chef Paco is a friend of mine\" which no doubt tells me he treats his employees as well as his customers.   I'm done Paco. You can take your flour tortillas and use them to wipe your.......tears because you will receive no more of my nickels or dimes. You can not be so hard up that you offer customers a choice and then charge them if they do not pick what is cheaper for you. When people buy from me and ask for extra powdered sugar I do not charge them a quarter. Your really out of your mind my friend.   Yes we honestly believe you served us low quality food because you were dumping your Paco power all over us 2 months ago. Because you can't remember who you throw out. So on the note, I fold. It's to bad it's the best flan in possibly the world.   One more thing the chili is the worst ALL BEANS no meat. Pass on it.",

My favorite dish is the chicken bowl but every time we go everyone walks away happy and full.  Keep in mind I would say that the price description is a little off.

I was only interested in the tacos so I made my way to that side of the building.  We ended up ordering al pastor and carnitas tacos.  These were actually really good!  They are certainly not the best tacos, but actually good.  They were kinda pricey but hey it is vegas, I suppose that is normal. Another good thing to note, is that I was really impressed with the chips and salsa.  They are not complimentary like most places but definitely worth the $3.00.  The green salsa was the best for me!  The churros did not disappoint! I wouldnt go as far as to say they were the best but close enough.  The real surprise of the meal was the flan though.  If you are a yelper and you check in, they offer you a free flan.  The flan is by far, the best flan I have ever tasted.  It is creamy and very dense.  The perfect flan texture! Definitely a must!",

So I've been here a few times since my last review.   The food and service has gotten much better over the last few years.   The last experience was last Saturday for a girls night. Vladamir was our waiter, and boy, he was on top of his shiz. There were 9 of us ladies, and I kid you not, we did not have to wait for more than a minute for him to keep checking up on when everyone arrived, got the other ladies drinks in the meantime, etc.   We all got our drinks so quickly and the food was insanely fast.  Let me tell you this; if there is anything I recommend here, it's the Carne Asada plate. It is the BEST I've had in town. With their cilantro rice...*vah lah*, it is FANTASTIC.   At the end, Vladimir was so kind to bring us a complimentary dessert. And we asked him if it was going to be difficult to split the checks. He said it would take him time, but he could do it. I tipped him 25% just to do it, because I know it's a pain in the ass.  He seriously got everyone's checks right and was so sweet about all of it.   Vladimir, you the real MVP, dude. Thanks for the wonderful experience!",

Open 24 hours, El Dorado's menu is extensive and the establishment prides itself on ingredients you feel good about (think organic, non-GMO).  When we came, it was happy hour, which we had no idea about until we saw it pop up on the TV screen during our meal. It would've been nice if they provided us with a happy hour menu or at least mentioned it. Upon arrival, they bring you a basket of chips and salsa, with the first basket being complimentary- refills are $3.50. We ordered a pitcher of sangria (pretty good), shrimp burrito and carne asada. We enjoyed our meals but the prices were rather steep. $20 for the shrimp burrito and it was mostly rice and other fillings. If you need a decent bite at any hour of the day regardless of the price, this place will hit the spot.",

The food was hot and fresh, the guacamole was tangy and flavorful, and the chicken in the burrito was so tender. Plus, having sat at the bar, I got to be graced by the pleasant and kind bartender, Whitney.  I will always continue to recommend this place to people for the cleanliness, attention to detail, the hospitality, and the food.  While I was only stopping through Vegas on my two week spiritual road trip, I thank my lucky stars to have tried this place on a whim years ago.  I'll be returning hopefully soon!  Compliments to the chef and Whitney for being so empathetic, sweet, and overall wonderful as a human being!    Best,  Kelsey Q",

I got three small sopes that had a ton of flavor and were well plated. The menu marks which items are gluten free, and you have a good selection  El Dorado Cantina shares a wall with a strip club, but it wasn't noisy. Atmosphere was really cool and clean, and there were TVs at the bars to watch sports.   El Dorado Cantina was a short Lyft ride from the strip and we got there in almost no time.

We had heard nothing but wonderful reviews about this location but let's be transparent, worst experience ever. Not only were the waiters inattentive....we waited TWO HOURS for our food. Granted, we were a group of 22 so it's understandable for a wait... but TWO HOURS!!?! 3/4 of our group literally left next door twice and still hadn't received food within the time span. It was ridiculous and what really was upsetting was they thought free margarita mix would be suffice for the ridiculous service and wait. On top of that, they still charged us for our \"complimentary\" drinks. Also, one of our plates had a  hair & we let the manager know, he was so rude to us and made smirky remarks about our complaint. The experience was so upsetting and we will not be returning here ever again.   But, as a side note I'd love to give credit to our Guac girl ROBIN! She was amazing to our table & she wasn't even our waitress!",

If you are looking for the best Margarita and the strongest without tasting the alcohol this is the place to go!!! Their Cadillac Margarita is amazing!!!   Their tinga tostadas is also the bomb from the app! Hmm queso fundido with chorizo is to die for! Just warm melted cheese, can never go wrong with that!!   Although the one plate we can never skip when eating dinner here is their Salmon on the plank! It's so good!! It comes w rice that taste like coconut rice! The consistency of that rice; it's always cooked to perfection. Never too dry never too wet! Just perfect! and all the veggies that comes w it; it's still crunchy but not raw! And never too well done! No one can stand mushy veggies! And the chipotle sauce for the salmon!! That's the jackpot!! It's sweet, tangy, bit spicy not too much! It's just so good!   We always sit in the bar; and service is always pretty good! Enough about this, you just need to go try em out!! You won't regret it :)",

Our second time visiting and this time with our teenage son. Two recommendations. The table side guacamole is out of sight and the Mahi Mahi Tacos are warm with a ton of flavor. If you're so inclined, they have a list of daily specials as well as a twice daily happy hour. They will soon be on the west side of the valley too. I cannot wait.

Chef Paco is a partial owner and his passion and talent is evident in the dishes we had.   Tableside Guacamole - why order this over the already made guac? It's fantastic. Robin brought a cart over and made our Guac for us. Extra garlic, extra lime...she really gets to know what you like and makes this guacamole just for you.  Steak Fajitas - standard tex-mex menu item. There is something about the quality of the meat El Dorado selects. These fajitas will easily be your favorite and what you compare any other fajitas to in the future.  House Margarita - nice big margaritas. Sweet and perfect.  Finally we had dessert. Do not go with your previous favorites. Forget everything and order the Flan. This is Chef Paco's grandmother's recipe. I have only ordered Tres Leches for dessert for over 15 years. That ends tonight. I am not joking. I will be craving that Flan for a while.   Every restaurant can have an off night. El Dorado Cantina is one of the best restaurants in Vegas and i recommend and will continue recommending it to everyone i know.   Thank you Doris, Robin, and Chef Paco for an amazing evening.",

It took them like 15 minutes to get us drinks and about 30mins to get our appetizer to our table . As I sat down I see that service is really slow and the people that were in the restaurant were not getting service quickly enough . We let that slide. We ordered our food and it literally took an hour to get 3 plates of enchiladas that were dry and been sitting the sauce was crusty and the tortilla was soaked the enchiladas were dry and sluggish my daughter had the taquitos that were very bland my son had a soup and it was oily and greasy  not only that refills were a hassle on top of that and our bill was 170.00  for poor service ..... our waiter was lost and forgetting to come back and check on us ..... I wonder how they do it when it's a full restaurant?  I would only recommend it for a couples night kinda place not really family friendly and the prices are out of control ..... for the price you pay make sure your customers are always getting the attention needed because I doubt people will come back .....",

I come here anytime i have the opportunity to take a visitor or my hubby and I decide to go out. I LOVE IT! Tonight we ordered to go (don't usually do this) and Sophie took my order. I had horrible reception as I was in a parking garage and she maintained so calm & patient with me. She informed me that the order would take a while so we decided to go in for a margarita while we waited. The bartender greeted us immediately, made our margaritas, and the manager showed up ensuring we were helped & greeted. We had margaritas, chips and salsa in front of us within minutes. Incredibly impressed for a Saturday night! I can't remember the last time I had THIS level of service anywhere! I watched the manager personally greet and serve every guest as the bartenders did their job servicing others. Sophie came out with our to go order, pulled everything out of the bag, went over it with us to make sure it was accurate! BOOM! That's what I'm talking about! El dorado you never cease to amaze me. This might sound like a ridiculously positive review but I am genuinely impressed and grateful. Thank you for making my night. I will CONTINUE to make this my choice restaurant  keep it UP!!! What you're doing is working and it is being noticed.",

    "text": "TL;DR: Yum! Great Mexican food, delicious free salsas and chips to start, free flan with checkin. I loved the big portions and you'll laugh at the fact that it's connected to a strip club.  After eating mediocre hotel food and lacking vegetarian options, friends and I found this spot on Yelp and made our way over. We were told that they were short staffed, but they did their best to give us fair warning and get our food out as fast as they could. We hardly noticed the delay.  Food: Chips and salsa to start are delicious - they give you two types of salsa and both are very fresh and house-made. I had the veggie bowl with brown rice and black beans and checked in for flan. Another friend also got the veggie bowl, but with refried beans and black beans and loved it. I thought it was very good, but was heavy on the rice and therefore almost too filling. If the rice were halved it would still be a great bowl and less food baby-inducing. Guac is extremely fresh, but bowl skimps a little on veggies. I was too full to finish my flan, but that's also great, creamy and smooth.    Atmosphere: Next to sapphire, the strip club. You can't tell once you're inside the restaurant, though. The restaurant is dark and feels much more upscale than other Mexican spots I've been to. Servers are friendly and helpful and pretty accommodating.",

As we ate, there were small groups of people meeting at the bar for happy hour, couples, and a few people watching football on the huge televisions ( I think there were like 6 very large TVs in total which I found a bit distracting and took away from a romantic mood I was hoping for). Service was friendly and the manager came over to say hi during our meal. The food was great quality and flavor. The price was high, but that is what you get with the beautiful atmosphere.  I would come here for a special occasion again to partake in their alcoholic beverages. I would also recommend bringing anyone from out of town to experience the extensive menu of delicious foods and tequila.",

The restaurant is located right next to the Sapphire gentlemen club and is open 24 hours. Both Eldorado's and Sapphire share the same parking lot.   I ordered the shrimp taco and added a side of cilantro sauce. The shrimps are succulent and the sauce is very flavorful. The cilantro rice is not Spanish rice but tasty and comes in ample portion.  Entrees cost around $18 to $20 and the service is attentive. The ambiance is on the showy side but it matches the atmosphere of surrounding gentlemen clubs.

    "text": "I decided to visit this location because of the positive Yelp reviews. My boyfriend and I are bartenders. So naturally, we decided to dine at the bar. Upon arrival, we were greeted pleasantly. When the bartender came over to take our order, I asked if there were any specials as it was a Tuesday. He stated, \"the ONLY specials we have are $3.50 tacos\". As I began to speak again, he asked for my patience. No problem. When he returned, I ordered tacos. I requested to add queso fresco. In a snappy voice, he stated \"the kitchen charges for anything you add\". I acknowledged and continued with my drink order. As I began to speak again, he cut me off saying \"We're sticking to food right now only, I will get your drink order later\". Now, I' wasn't attitudinal and totally in a great mood. And in the bartenders defense, I understand we all have a bad day. But, in my 12 years of serving/bartending, have I never told a guest what they can and cannot say when I am \"waiting\" and providing a service for them. But, I digressed. My boyfriend caught my shock, however continued with his order. Now, I didn't mention we knew about their tequila special on Tuesday. But, when the bartender previously stated the ONLY offered specials for Taco Tuesday were $3.50 tacos, we assumed this special was no more. I then observed other bar guest ordering several shots of the tequila special. When the bartender returned with my boyfriend's drink, we asked if the Don Julio special was still a part of Taco Tuesday. Seeming annoyed, he stated \"oh yea\" - as I previously saw him run through a full bottle for several guest since we sat. At that point, I was displeased and my dining experience was ruined by POOR SERVICE. Our food arrived and I asked another very nice bartender for a to go box. I can't speak on the food because I was so disappointed at the service I received, I left it sitting on the bar. El whatever the name of your restaurant is, do better next time please.",

    "text": "El Dorado Cantina is one of my favorite new restaurants in town.  This definitely rivals Javier's at Aria for the \"high end\" Vegas Mexican cuisine market, but the prices are way more reasonable.  Chef Paco and his staff are churning out some really good stuff.    Want a great way to spice up a weekday dinner?  How about doing as the Aztecs did back in the day (century) and start off with some grasshoppers?  Yes, sir!  EDC's \"chapulines\" can be prepared sauteed either in garlic lime or habanero.  For the uninitiated, the closest thing to compare them to would be crispy shrimp tails but juicier.  The habanero order offered terrific heat and not in a painful, shoot me in the face kind of way.  At $7.50, it was a large portion that could have easily satisfied a party of six.  Not for everyone by any means, my wife was literally one and done, but I enjoyed it and had plenty to take home (fried rice, anyone?).  \"Imperial Shrimp\" was everything I look for in an appetizer: seafood stuffed Pacific wild shrimp wrapped in bacon and then lightly fried. The creamy heat (sounds gross, right?) from the chipotle ranch dressing that accompanied the dish was awesome.  More things in life should be wrapped in bacon!  I should start a national campaign.  We chose to split the humungous carne asada entree.  The citrus marinated steak was medium rare perfection.  I loved the big slabs of grilled cactus that it came with.  We probably boxed up 70 percent of the plate.  Goddamn nachos and salsa....  You'd think that would prevent us from ordering dessert, but the flan and tres leches cake somehow made it to the table.  The latter was plated nicely and the rum flavor made me feel like I was on vacation.  It was a great end to the meal and I can't wait to try more.",

We heard her say it to patrons across from us at the bar after we ordered. Also we wanted just a bottle of modelo and they were sold out. Okay no worries. Two, she seemed flustered although there was like 5-8 ppl at the bar? Then we get our food. My boyfriend ordered two sides of beans to sub out for the rice and beans combo. So his food is brought to the bar to us and it has double rice. No biggie.  We inform the food server and she says no worries leave it I'll tell the chef. So we're eating our tacos and then the other bartender comes back and TAKES the plate that we're eating on to \"show the chef\" that he messed up. Uhm what. If a food item is in error u send it back w out giving it to the guest first not have the guest eat on the plate and then ask to take it back mid eating. Besides the fact the tacos tasted like they were frozen or microwaved. I really don't wanna complain we both work in the industry and both are locals that frequent here a good amount out. Super disappointed.",

If you're drawn here because of their high rating know it probably is 4.5* Nevada \"good\" Mexican but we are from East Los Angeles and the food at any hole in the wall, typical food truck (or even Chipotle) in Southern California is honestly better (and half the price) than the same stuff we ordered here. We went with a carne asada burrito and a carnitas burrito. So can't get much more basic than that. The plates comes with what they call cilantro rice (see photo) but my significant other identified it right away as Minute boxed white rice with butter (what my SO describes as \"white people rice\".. her white mother used to make it for her as a child). Anyway, I have never seen that before at a Mexican restaurant.  So if you are familiar with or looking for some good Mexican food I would suggest going somewhere else.

    "text": "Interesting Fact: The father owns Sapphire Gentleman's Club and his son owns El Dorado Cantina - that's why they share the same massive blue Sapphires building. Don't worry, you can still come here with nana and little Tommy - El Dorado's entrance and dining room is separate from Sapphires and just a couple of steps to the left of the strip club's entrance.   Parking: If you see the massive blue glowing Sapphires building, you're at the right place. Turn into their parking lot, try to dodge the shitty cab drivers all lined up at Sapphires and snag yourself a parking spot right in front.   I'm embarrassed to admit this, but ever since I moved here from Southern California, I pretty much wrote off Mexican cuisine, until now. I've had way too many terrible experiences and disappointments - I couldn't find any of the juicy and spicy flavors I was looking for.  Well, that all changed when I tasted El Dorado's trio of salsas, I knew from the very first bite, that my dinner would follow suit with how incredible the salsas tasted. They have 3 different spice levels mild (roasted green tomatillo), medium (charred chipotle), and crazy spicy (habanero). They don't mess around here! The spicy habanero salsa had lots of smashed chunks of habanero chilies; so let this be your warning, it's spicy but also so damn flavorful. I didn't have a favorite because they were all so incredibly flavorful. The best salsas I've had in a while. Flavor rating: 5/5  Here's what we ordered:  Tostaditas de Tinga $5.50 (Gluten Free) - Flavor rating: 5/5 You can order these from the small bites/appetizers menu and they are crazy good! Super moist and flavorful chipotle marinated chicken with grilled onions, served over fresh crispy tostadas, topped with flavorful refried beans, queso fresco, sour cream, and (mild red) salsa cascabel - comes with 3 for $5.50 or $2.75 during happy hour! It looks simple, but the flavors are explosive! Top them with any one (or all) of the trio salsas they give you, for an extra added wow!   Al Pastor $9.50 - Flavor rating: 3/5 Marinated pork with pineapple chunks, cilantro, onion & lime. Comes with three tacos per platter, served with moist and perfectly seasoned cilantro rice & your choice of refried or black beans - get the refried beans! Typically, I wouldn't care for beans, but they're very moist and packed with amazing flavor. They aren't the best or most authentic al pastor tacos I've ever had, but the tacos were very moist and everything on the plate tasted freshly prepared. The al pastor meat was a tad mild in flavor and spices for my taste. Yet, everything else on the dish was seasoned perfectly.   Chicken Enchiladas $13.50 - Flavor rating: 4/5 Slow cooked chicken breast marinated in chiles, wrapped in fresh corn tortillas & cheese, topped with mild and flavorful green tomatillo sauce, sour cream & queso fresco.  Served with delicious and well seasoned cilantro rice & your choice of refried or black beans. The portion size is generous and filling. We enjoyed the flavor of the moist enchiladas and with added dollops of salsa of each bite.   We also tried the Strawberry Agua Fresca. It was refreshing and not too sweet, but I think it was slightly watery for my preference. It's still perfect for warm weather, spicy food and I enjoyed it. Flavor rating: 3/5  I'm a huge fan of this place! The chef truly shines at his talent and you can really taste the care that went into each preparation. I can tell it's been taste-tested before served and I'm a fan of restaurants that pride themselves in quality control. Plus, the service we received from KAI that evening was top-notch. He went above and beyond to make sure we were well taken care of.   Other important details:   Happy Hour twice a day: * 3pm - 6pm - $1 street tacos, 1/2 off bottled domestics & wells * 11pm - 2am - 1/2 off all appetizers, 1/2 off bottled domestics & wells  Pro tip: during the day it's more-so family friendly and during the late-night-owl hours and onward, there is more of a mature crowd with a sprinkle of girls off the clock grabbing their dinner after work.",

    "text": "I'm starting to wonder why the best yet cheapest meals in Vegas are found next door/ across the street from a strip club. Not that there is something wrong with that - we all need to eat. Well, this one is right next door to Sapphire which I avoid like the plague since I know somebody who works here and I think it's just awkward to see somebody you know but not romantically involved with without their clothes on.   The place has a cozy lounge-y feel. Make sure you enter the left door if you want tacos on a plate. The right door has dancing naked tacos. I tried all of their street tacos. They were all good but some stood out more than the others.  Al Pastor Taco: Marinated pork with cilantro, pineapple, onion and lime. Eaxctly like what you'll find on the streets. 5/5  Carne Asada Taco: Marinated steak with guacamole, onion, lime and cilantro. The steak was so tender and well-seasoned. It's a safe choice. 5/5  Carnitas: Braised pork wih guacamole, onion, lime and cilantro. Juicy and dripping wet. 5/5  Pulled Chicken: Marinated chicken with onions, spices and pico de gallo. Chicken tacos tend to be boring and blah but this one was very tasty, tender, perfectly cooked and not dry. 4/5  Cochinita: Slow-roasted pork marinated in achiote with pickled habanero and onions. This  one definitely stood out. It seemed tame like a Catholic school girl but once you dig deeper, it's crazy! You'll be all hot and sweaty by the time you're done. 5/5  Cantaloupe Aguas Fresca: This is easy to make at home but sometimes, I just don't feel like making anything at home. Their drink specials change everyday.  Since it wasn't horchata day, I got this instead. a drinkable form of cantaloupe. 4/5  I tend to get sick when I eat street tacos. Considering I had good tacos from here and didn't get sick, I would have to say I found my safe taco haven. \"Honey, I was only parked at Sapphire to eat some tacos\" would be a True and accurate statement if you go to El Dorado.  The service was great. There was only one server at lunch time when we went taking care of at least 5 tables including ours. But she was always smiling and seemed to like what she was doing. The chef also came out to talk to diners and get their feedback.",

    "text": "Overall - Not recommended at all.  While the street tacos were pretty good. The service is what really drives me away. Most of their signature tacos I did not order were expensive and were actually pretty bland. I would be careful coming here. Maria looks at customers as money bags not people. Note this place also has been flagged for multiple reviews from the same IP address so this place is as shady as it comes.  Parking Pretty plentiful. Note that it is attached to the strip club. I originally thought it was just next to it.  Service The worst service experience I have ever had. We came in at 2am on Tuesday wanting to try all of their street tacos. Our waitress Maria recommended we try the Chile Verde, shrimp and octopus. Which was fine but then she then passed by and mentioned something about cabeza and lengua in which we said no thank you, but it still came out anyway. She then took it upon herself to just order random signature taco on the menu without telling us.  When she brought out the tacos she only named the tacos that we ordered and skipped over everything else. Which turned out to be tacos from their more expensive signature tacos, most of which not even as good as their street tacos. We were only expecting to pay $20-$30 for this meal, walked out feeling swindled and $80 lighter.  Food Carne Asada - Standard carne asada. 3 stars  Cochinita - I really enjoyed this one. First time ever hearing about this. 5 stars  Al Pastor - Again nothing special compared to the other various places I have tried. 3 stars  Pulled Chicken - Other places have rather dry chicken and this place does a good job of marinating theirs. 4 stars  Carnitas - Had an extra kick to it that made it stand out. 4 stars  Corn Rajas -  Just plain weird, I knew it was meatless.1 star  Chile Verde - Pretty good. 4 stars  Octopus-Chorizo - Chorizo is always a bit too salty for my taste but adding octopus made it just plain weird. It also looked like they burned the octopus. 1 star  Shrimp - Meh I have experienced better. 2 stars  Mentioned but did not agree to order them.  Lengua - Was lacking in flavor. 2 stars.  Cabeza - Again nothing special from anywhere else I have tried. 3 stars.  Tacos that were not even mentioned and came out just because.  Salmon - This seemed like a dish they had just because it was just bland and the most expensive taco ($8!) that we did not order. 1 star.  Grilled Mahi - Again nothing special. 3 stars.  Fried shrimp? - Not sure what this was suppose to be on the menu but it was like small pieces of fried something with a lot of garnishes that tasted sweet.1 star.",

My family and I ordered an assortment of items, ranging from nachos to carne asada burritos. So to start, the chips and salsa were a jey indicator that this place was going to be tasty. When my order came out, it came with white rice and black beans on the side, typically I don't care for these things at a restaurant because its usually bland and basic, to my surprise, Whoa! Best rice and beans Ive ever had. I also ordered a margarita, very strong love it, that means they didn't try to cheat me out of a good drink. Finally I had a flan, now ive had several flans in my life and don't care much for them, but this place had The beat flan I've ever tasted! I highly recommend this place, I will be coming back.",

It has a wide range of options (I love their carnitas) and we strongly suggest the table side guacamole. Even on their busiest nights my wife and I have never felt rushed by the staff to leave so we can enjoy our meal in peace. The restaurant is connected to Sapphire so after a day at their Sensual pool, an evening inside their club Sensual, or just a mid-week craving for incredible food, this is the only place we'll go.

    "text": "For the most part, having a couple dishes and one visit usually isn't enough to truly evaluate a restaurant as a whole, but that's all I needed. We were aided with a spectacular server that help choose perfect dishes for us and provided top notch service. I knew this place was on another level from the time we sat down and had chips with salsas that had a different flavor compared to others. To me, there was just a little extra boost of flavor or heat with every dish that had us nodding our heads after every bite.  Chris, our server, was the difference maker. He greeted us immediately, was always present throughout our Monday night meal, and had knowledge of the menu because he's tasted all the items on the menu. He was able to describe each and every flavor in each dish which made everything that much more appetizing. He had recommendations with every aspect of the meal such as suggesting refried beans versus black for a side and making sure my friend ordered his burrito enchilada style versus dry. When I was unsure what I wanted to order, he interjected, \"Paco's mole sampler\" before I could finish my sentence asking what his suggestions were.  To start, we had a vertical flight of Patron (my choice, not Chris's) and the recommended Tostaditas de Tinga which is pretty simple, but a delicious tostada elevated with some heat from the chipotle marinated chicken and the salsa cascabel. The flight with sangrita was definitely a nice sampling of tequila as I'm a fan of Patron, but the tequilas really didn't pair well any of the food and just added to my inebriated state. I think a margarita would have been a better pairing with my food and the only thing that i would have changed. In fact, I'm going to make a margarita for myself right now to make up for my poor choice.  Although we didn't get to speak with Chef Paco because our 10 PM arrival may have been too late, the mole sampler was a nice representation of him and his food. I'm no expert on moles and haven't had many in my life, but I do know it's a painstaking, lengthy process to make in which you have to empty the kitchen pantry and spice rack. I also know these chicken moles, although quite different and distinct in flavor, were fantastic. The guajillo chipotle chile was my favorite mole with a brighter flavor that had me sweating like a mad man.  The mole, the clean and fresh product, the 25% discount for locals on Monday night, the free flan with Yelp check in, and the outstanding service makes El Dorado as good as it gets. I'll be back with hopes that this wasn't just a one time experience, but I'll put some money down that it wasn't.",

The bartender quickly acknowledged us and told us he would be right with us. There were about 4-5 couples around the bar so it was busy too. Chips & a red & green salsas were delivered to us from the back by a good runner. Having time to look over the menu I ordered the carnitas street taco plate & the hubs ordered the specialty shrimp tacos. Both plates arrived fast 5-10 minutes. The rice & beans were decent and the carnitas we too wet & greasy. The tortillas were practically falling apart. The flavor was good but not cravable. The hubs shrimp tacos were decent but lacked seasoning. I did check in & got our free flan. It's super creamy but again lacks flavor. It was horrible but not something I would choose to come back to for Mexican food.",

This just became my new favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. The meat is so tender and juicy, not dry at all. The service is top-notch!! Yes, it is next to a strip club but that doesn't take away from all the wonders this restaurant has to offer. If you're a local make sure you go on Monday to take advantage of the 25%off deal.

So if you are bringing kids, don't go here.   Went in on a Saturday at 4pm. Almost empty, and we still stood at the front without anyone greeting us for more than a minute before we finally sat ourselves.   Eventually someone came over and took a drink order and dropped off chips and salsa. Great salsa. Too bad I had to go steal napkins and silverware from another table because nobody ever brought us any.   Somehow the waitress was overwhelmed by the four tables she had. The manager and I'm guessing owner, just stood behind the bar talking. Never walked around and talked to guests or tried to assist their poorly trained waitress who didn't know what a Corkage fee was.   Food was mediocre at best. But I'm from Los Angeles where there's an abundance of Mexican food.   Asked them to call us a cab, and after ten minutes when I went to see where it was, I was told they were unable to get one. Wow.   I do NOT recommend this place.",

The server greeted us right away and sat us. I didn't catch her name but she really sucked. I don't think I've ever had service this slow in my life. Took 10 minutes to get our drink order in and the complimentary chips, and another 10 minutes to get our food order in. Then we had to wait 30 minutes for an order of street tacos and 2 orders of enchiladas. On top of that we had to wait 10 minutes for a sauce the server forgot to bring out when we asked for it when she took our order. Then we ate our food for maybe 20 minutes, she didn't check on us at all. We had to flag her down to get a refill for coke. I had ONE glass of water the whole time I was there that NEVER got refilled. After we were done eating I realized she had 4 tables. She asks us if we want dessert and I say yes I want to use my free flan from my check in. She says okay and then we wait another 20 minutes for it. At this point I am irritated with waiting and thought she forgot about it so I just wanted the check and then she brings out the flan and says \"sorry that took so long\" so now I'm forced to stay. We ate the flan and then ask for the check, she drops it off and comes back in 10 minutes and I ask her to split it. She tells me \"well I have to make 2 guacs so if you want it split you have to wait 10 minutes.\" What the f*%$. That was the cherry on top of it because I could tell she was just being lazy. So I tell her fine just put it on one card and comes back and had the nerve to say \"you guys were awesome\" just to get a tip out of us when she knew her service was horrible. I even heard her tell somebody \"you're going to have to wait before I take your order so if you just want to leave that's okay\" and he was appalled she said that to him.  The food was better than the service. I tried the chicken enchiladas and I thought they were good. I had the street taco plate, my refried beans were waaay too salty. I didn't like the taste of the rice because it was sweet, it reminded me of coconut sticky rice without the sticky. The tacos were good, the meat was cooked perfectly but honestly for the price they weren't anything amazing. I still prefer Taco El Buen Pastor for $2 a taco instead of $4.50 at Eldorado. The flan was really good though, that might be the only thing I would consider coming back for. For 3 people, no apps, just 3 meals I paid $69, which to me is expensive for Mexican food that was just mediocre.  We didn't get out of there until 1:30 am when this was supposed to just be a quick bite for us. My problem is there were 2 bartenders and nobody sitting at the bar and more tables with 1 server. The bartenders should've stepped in to help her so that service wasn't slow for everybody OR management should know better to have more servers on a Saturday night in Las Vegas, especially when they are next to a busy strip club *rolls eyes*  Way to make a good impression on my first visit here lol. I won't be back.",

    "text": "One of the most authentic and delicious Mexican restaurants I have ever been to. We were a bit early for our reservation so we had a margarita at the bar, and oh my goodness was it the real thing! I also appreciated the fact that it came in a real margarita glass and not just a highball glass like something other places serve them in--it makes it taste better and ok it's more exciting for the gram. Once we sat down at our lovely booth, we were given delicious chips and different kinds of salsa for free. After glancing over the very extensive and mouth-watering menu, I almost jumped up and down with excitement seeing they offered a mole tasting platter (and no it was not the buzz from the margarita). Mole is one of my favorite foods and very rare to find on a menu in my experience. It came with some fresh and delicious tortillas to eat with. All three moles were delectable. We ordered two tacos ala carte in addition to the mole, one cactus and one octopus. So much more interesting than your standard beef or chicken (although here even regular beef would be anything but standard. Of course we ended up ordering a second round of drinks and both tried the jalapeno margarita--superb.   If the food wasn't enough to accumulate the 5 stars, the service certainly was. Not only was our waiter attentive and friendly, I loved that he asked which mole was our favorite--it just showed he was interested in our dining experience vs just clearing the table. One of the hostesses passing our table at one point came over and asked us if we wanted her to take a picture of us with our food--so sweet and so above and beyond! We just adored the whole experience and hope to be back one day soon.",

Table side guac was terrific. Created just as we asked, just the right amount of spice. The salsas there are also always delicious.   Dinner arrived. Fish tacos for my husband. He said they were fantastic. Veggie tacos for me. Need some work, plain and nearly raw. Lacking spice. So much more could have been done to make this dish better. In fairness, I did not report this to the bartender as the restaurant had become very busy and we had a show to attend. Hopefully this review will inspire some improvement in the vegetarian options offered.   We enjoyed our experience and look forward to returning many times to come. Highly recommend.",

At other restaurants, his normal response would be \"it's not that bad.\" My husband is of Latin decent so he was happy with the spices and flavors. We had the fresh guacamole which they make at the table. Our waitress is named Grace. We enjoyed talking with her while she made our guacamole and the service we received from her was excellent. I had the lettuce wrap tacos which were very refreshing and ranged around $16.  If you love flan, the flan here CAN NOT be missed. It's perfect. It's buttery, smooth and creamy.

In the words of my sister, who's sharing this amazing meal with me, \"this is legit insane.\" The food AND service here is fantastic. Best service that I've received in Vegas thus far. Do yourself a favor and get the Mexican street corn. The jalapeno margarita was delightful! Had the Mahi tacos which were spectacular. Will DEFINITELY come back. Our server Enrique was super helpful and has a great attitude. Thank you for a fantastic dinner!!!! Loved it!!",

I really liked the Carne Asada plate, which also came with a grilled cactus that was delicious. The dessert was great, the flan, and the churros were yummy.  The location was a little funny being next to a gentleman's club, and there was a scary dude like crying or something in the parking lot, but there was a security guard there.  I like that it's 24 hours.  Also, heard there are locals discounts on mondays, that's a plus in my book!",

We finished with some tasty flan, which ranks among the best I've ever had. Great service as well!

The only thing to be aware of is that the restaurant is in the same building as the \"world's largest strip club\". Be aware of this when booking. There are no strippers in the restaurant and doesn't seem to be any kind of walkway between the two venues, but their front doors are right next to each other. Overall it was a good experience once we got over the shock of pulling a van full of business people into a strip club parking lot.",

It's literally located next to the Sapphire (world's largest gentlemen's club). I'll guarantee that you'll see the sign for Sapphire before you noticed El Dorado Cantina.   Service: The experience started off sour when another party was seated, who came in after us... We were told by another staff member to wait as they cleaned tables up... I would suggest better communication and training.   Greg acknowledge the incident and was a great host. He deeply apologize to us and was attentive to all of our party needs. He provided great suggestions based on our flavor profile and was extremely pleased.   Food: Don't get scared away by the $$. You not only get large portions. They are also a non-GMO restaurant. They also have a huge selection of vegetarian and gluten-free items.   Chip and Salsa - Fresh Crispy chips and flavored rich salsa profile.  Nacho - This is a nacho you need to share between a group of 3+ people. Even in my party of three people. It was a lot to handle  Posole Soup - It was quite possibly my favorite soup, especially on a cold winter night. The deep taste of cumin, bright splashes of lime and cilantro, the light bite of hot sauce, this Posole recipe has it all!   Quesadilla - Extremely cheesy and full of flavor for such a small bite.  Flan - Had such a flavor rich jello.   Fried Ice Cream - Perfect amount of fried ness and crunchiness   WiFi (For Yelpin + Insta): Yas! However, there is low lighting! Hard to take photos of the yummy food.   Overall: I had a good experience overall! I would rate it 5/5. I would highly suggest coming back.",

The portion sizes were pretty much enough for 2 people to eat one meal.   Let's start with their guacamole. After deliberation with my partner, we determined it was the best tasting guac we've ever had. To our surprise, our waitress rolled a cart over to our table and started making fresh guac right in front of us. We were able to customize the flavor to the spice levels that we enjoyed. The flavors were perfectly parlance and the avocados used were so fresh.   We also ordered the chicken tostados. The chicken had a Smokey flavor to it, which I liked, but it was one of those overall flavors where I could fully enjoy one but two would be too much.   For dinner we ordered the chicken and shrimp fajita and the carne asada plate. Both meals were beyond excellent. The meats were perfectly seasoned, juicy, and tender. The sides were also very flavorful. Only complaint is my fajita came with so much chicken and 3 pierce of shrimp.   The service was excellent.   The restaurant is also open 24 hours so it's a quality late night meal. You can make a reservation online through yelp, which is cool because we were seated immediately.",

The decor is great, the drinks are great albeit a little pricey, and the menu is awesome.  I had the lettuce wrap steak tacos and the flavor was amazing.  They make super fresh table side guacamole that looked delish.  My coworkers had cheese enchiladas with verde sauce and the other had a carne asada burrito. Both were awesome.

    "text": "So I'm officially a regular. Tuesdays are great. Can't beat the Don Julio $6 a shot special. Came in and my usual bartender, Whitney, was there. She knew my drink Don Julio chilled and got it right away. I also got chips and water as soon as I sat down. I love the video food menu. It helps in my decision on my order. Whitney as always is on top of everything. Those 1942 shots go down so quickly. Lol. And she's so nice. And, as also, Doris , the manager, is great.   She helps out with making sure the place is cleaned up and looks great. She talks to customers and makes sure they are satisfied.  Can't say enough about this place!!!  This place rocks!!!!  Didn't think I was going to make it here this week. But made it happen. Usually I come here in the afternoon in Tuesday-for my Don Julio fix.  But made it by 6:30pm. This place was busy. You'd think it was Friday night. Everything was amazing as usual. Got the shrimp celantro. Delicious!  I was nervous about the service considering the amount of clientele but was pleasantly surprised. Three words-Jazz, Jazz, Jazz. He was on top of everything. He's behind the bar and makes sure people are taken care of.  From chips to water to just basically making sure you are taken care of. What a stand up server. Please go see him. You won't be disappointed. All of the servers are great but jazz really makes it quite the experience. And don't forget to see Whitney behind the bar during the day. She rocks   So another great time at el dorado cantina. My girl, Whitney the bartender, was there to take of me as she always does. She is spot on with everything. This place has new specials. Lobster tacos are amazing. And as always, Don Julio 1942 shots are the best deal in town on Tuesdays. Doris, the manager, is great. So friendly and accommodating. She said they were featured on local news, which is no small feat. I met chef Raphael. He was kind enough to introduce himself. This place is over all 5 star- staff, food, ambiance. And they're opening a new place in summerlin this fall. I will let all of my summerlin friends know. Don't miss out on this place. Oh and they have happy hour too!!!!!!!",

The dishes are locally sourced as possible and done very well. It's not cheap but very much worth it. My only caveat would be to stay mindful of the heat levels-spicy foods make my face swell up and I e been caught off guard at just how spicy some things have been (looking at you soup!). Service is good, ample parking next to the strip club. Vegetarian options too!!",

We stopped by El Dorado, where they graciously took us despite being in between shifts, therefore short staffed. They problem solved and made sure that our order was taken promptly (training the bus boy on the spot, and he was awesome!). They accommodated my parents' cantankerous behavior, their embarrassing complaining and anxiety about getting out of their on time for the show. But the best part was that their food was incredible! I can't wait to return when I'm free of parental whining and not under time constraints. The staff didn't miss a beat despite our challenging party. The manager even asked us what show we were going to see and gave us some tips!",

The restaurant itself is attached to a strip club so I figured it was prob not the best place but still decided to give it a try. When walking in the atmosphere was so nice! We sat in a semi circle booth and right away we were served. The menu had a variety of different options to choose. We finally decided on the table side guacamole, shrimp taquitas and seafood enchiladas. We also ordered the Cadillac margarita which features premium alcohol in a large pitcher, enough to serve 5 drinks.  The best part about the experience was the table maids guacamole. The servers bright along a table and made the guacamole fresh right in front of you and it tasted absolutely amazing! I will definitely come back!",

We started out with margaritas, which were perfectly made. Nice and strong and not too sweet.  Our server Camille suggested the table side guacamole, and it did not disappoint. It was fresh and delicious, with just the right amount of spice and flavor.  My friend also got some phenomenal tacos, and I settled on the cheese enchiladas, both recommended by our server. We were highly impressed by her excellent recommendations. No room for dessert, unfortunately, but we will definitely be back for more of the wonderful food and service. Thank you Camille!!!",

Great flavors, great prices. I've never had flan that I liked before, until we tried the chef's grandmother's recipe. Yum! A little hard to find, just go to the north valet parking lot entrance of the strip club...open 24 hours. I will be back!

I had to share that because it caught my boyfriend and I off guard (More him than me given it was his first time in Vegas).  While it is part of Sapphire it is separate in the sense that it has its own entrance and you are not at all exposed to the scene.    Now as for the restaurant.  Its a nice restaurant, and we were pleasantly surprised by the food.  We started with fresh guacamole, which was a bit more salty than what we prefer.  For dinner I ordered the Chicken Enchiladas with black beans and rice, and had the Torta de Milanesa.  We both really enjoyed our food.  The salsa on my enchiladas was divine.    The Flan we had for dessert was one of the most delicious I have ever had.  It was thicker and creamier than most.  It was simply fantastic!  The quality and portion of the food along with the price, make this a winner in Vegas.  It was easily the cheapest meal we had and for the price one of the best.

AND the taste is phenomenal.  My husband is pescatarian (fish and veggies only) so this was the perfect place for us.  Do not miss the table side guacamole and the street tacos they are to die for.  We enjoy those along with some bottomless gluten free chips and salsa until our dinner entrees arrived. I had the Cochinita Pibil and my husband had the Tropical Mahi.  The pork is organically sourced and Mahi is wild caught.  But the citrus habanero sauce is worth going on and on about.  Sweet tasting on the front then be prepared for the long after burn.  The flavor is out of this world.  Oh and the Cochinita is wonderful too.  I am so blown away by this awesome place.  I definitely recommend this place for everyone especially those who have a restricted diet to follow.",

Everything from street tacos to more traditional full plates. I found it hard to find good authentic mexican food once I moved here to Vegas. I tried a few places for just some regular street tacos and was always disappointed.  Well I found my home away from home. El Dorado did not disappoint! Their tacos de Lengua and aguas frescas hit the spot. Tacos de Nopal was cooked to perfection. My son enjoyed their chapulines. And we even fought over the last bite of their delicious flan. My family and I will definitely be back. Thank you Chef for the amazing food and experience.",

Table side guacamole is made to taste and 100% simple fresh ingredients...fab. We had everything from beef fajitas, and taquitos to the more Mexican regional Cochinita Pibil (pork and chilies wrapped in banana leaf), homemade scratch mole (unbelievable...the real deal), and Pork Carnitas.   If you get the chance to meet Chef Paco ask him to tell you about his mothers recipes and do not miss his grandmothers 80 year old flan recipe, it's like velvet.

    "text": "Great place! I saw a billboard advertising this restaurant using organic and non-gmo ingredients, so I asked my husband to try this place with me. And we went tonight and had an awesome dinner. The server Jesse was very sincere, courteous and helpful. He started us with tortilla chips and a sample of hibiscus tea. The tea was awesome, the chips was very good. I normally hate chips but I still think theirs was good.  Jesse gave good attention to my intolerance to garlic and went to check with the kitchen to find out what had been pre-marinated with garlic, so that I wouldn't order something that I can't eat. So we ordered the house salad with the cilantro dressing on the side ( as there is garlic in the dressing), but he also brought me one more blue cheese dressing on the side. The salad was very fresh and good quality. The avocado in the salad was very good, it was ripe, fatty and no black color ( which could be commonly seen even in what you can buy in supermarkets). I know it sounded funny but we were really impressed with the quality of the avocado and the other veggie in the salad. I have a very sensitive stomach. I would feel abdominal discomfort if I eat bad veggie. And I had no discomfort but only enjoyment from the salad. So it was great! I liked my blue cheese dressing and my husband likes the cilantro dressing.   For entrees, I ordered the tilapia without garlic butter while my husband ordered carne asada (steak) taco. I was advised not to order the items with steak because they were all pre-marinated with garlic and other seasonings. While I can't  comment on the taco, my husband told me it was awesome. He said it is the best taco he ever had. And I think I also had the best tilapia here too! I never knew that tilapia could taste so good until tonight. I tasted tilapia from other american restaurants before and they never tasted good. But here at El Dorado, their tilapia was made very well! And the chef also made a different sauce for me as I couldn't have the garlic butter. The sauce he made was mango something (forgot the actual name). It was awesome. There was also a balsamic vinegrette on the side in case I didn't like the mango something sauce. And the fish tasted great and went well with either sauce! Their balsamic vinegrette is also very different from what you can find else where. Theirs is very thick, not too sour and has a bit of sweetness. I never like those over sour vinaigrette else where, so I am impressed with their version of balsamic vinegrette.  At the end, the chef gave us a complimentary flan as dessert, and we also ordered a tres leches cake. They were both great. The flan was especially exceptional. Theirs tasted very dense, rich, and I could taste that it was made with all real good ingredients with no fillers like gelatine. It tasted better than any other flan I had in the past (which were very much like gelatine texture). The trees leches cake was good, tasted fresh and the leches sauce has a hint of rum taste. Everything was great and we were very happily filled at the end.  We are happy that we found this place. Please keep up the good work and we are grateful for the big billboard advertisement.",

The one and only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because all of the wine is organic and $18 per glass!! I'm all about GMO free and organic but that's a little excessive. An $8 or $9 glass of house wine should be offered. Highly recommend. Will definitely go back.",

So I was excited to order some food this time! I had  one of each of the street tacos and was pleasantly surprised by the range of flavors in EACH taco! My favorite item was the chicken street taco, accompanied by  Cilantro rice &  fresh refried beans really brought the dish together. The fact that my tacos arrived in a doubled traditional corn tortilla, & the waiter prepared my guacamole TABLESIDE, gave this new hot spot serious authenticity! Between the quality, freshness, attention to detail in ALL the flavors, & fantastic atmosphere this will absolutely be somewhere I return again & again!",

It is a large restaurant with a lot of open space. Great bar with tons of High def televisions.   The food here is good but not amazing, in my opinion. The delicious items were the table side guacamole, street tacos, and the conchinita pibil....oh yeah the pitchers of margaritas are pretty solid.  I like that they use organic meats and non gmo products...that is pretty amazing.  Service for us was pretty amazing. Our server Enrique was phenomenal: warm, friendly, attentive.....just great.  Prices are not cheap. The guac was $13 bucks, the conchinita pibil was 25. The real deal were those street tacos....I had the carnitas, carne asada, and conchinita pibil ( spicy baby) for 13 bucks...only bummer is they charge for rice and beans....WTF??? 2.50 extra.  What really brought us was that locals get 25% off the total bill on Mondays for locals....and no I did not go next door for a lap dance....although the bouncer wanted me to take a picture with one of their lovely employees....yeah that would sit well with my fam!",

    "text": "Appalled would be a drastic understatement to describe my experience at El Dorado... I brought my children in to what I thought would be an enjoyable environment for us to have dinner at only to leave completely disappointed.  For starters the staff seemed less that amused to be there and we were ignored for the first few minutes of walking in.  We weren't greeted by anyone until I summoned someone to help us.  The service was slow, yet felt rushed every time the server was at our table.  The food was mediocre when it finally arrived and my middle sons food was made incorrectly; I specified more than once he is a vegetarian so absolutely no meat and low and behold his food turns up and has chicken in it.   Although annoyed I didn't bother making too big of a scene and we had his food remade and then finished our meal.  When the bill came I was surprised to see that I was still being charged for my sons meal that was made incorrectly- whether it was the fault of our server or the cooks there is no way in hell I should have to pay for it.  At this point my youngest had had enough and so had I so I paid the bill and we left.  As if that hour and half of treacherous service wasn't enough, myself and my oldest fell ill that evening and experienced the worst bout of food poisoning I've ever had.  My oldest son is autistic, and when sick he goes into sheer panic mode. Imagine trying to calm down a 9 year old projectile vomiting while he's thrashing around a hotel bathroom, all while attempting to maintain composure while you're fighting the urge to succumb to the violent illness that food poisoning is... keep in mind I still have 2 other children that were in my care.  This lasted 13 hours. It was pure hell.  The next morning I had my assistant call and email the restaurant to let them know what had transpired and got absolutely no response other than \"how can you be sure it was from our establishment\".  I'm absolutely disgusted that a restaurant could be so careless in the preparation of their food and just as clueless at the front of the house.  I will NEVER step foot into this so called restaurant ever again and will do whatever I possibly can to prevent others from having to experience such an awful place.",

Anyway, I ordered the veggie burrito with a few adjustments. It's was okay, just not enough salt. I don't even like a lot of salt but they were very light with it. They get huge points because they have vegan and vegetarian options and they are GMO free. The chef is very nice. He came out and introduced himself. Also they are open 24/7...which is weird to me. Apparently they accommodate to the strip club next door. I just hope they don't end up losing money. One last thing, I wish the waitresses didn't have to dress so, *clears throat* traditional, to put it nicely. Do I really need to see all of that cleavage? It looks uncomfortable.",

    "text": "Absolutely loved the place - my girlfriend took me there for my birthday and the food, service, and prices were all excellent. The location is a very odd choice - not only is it on Industrial Road (for people who do not live in Las Vegas, Industrial Road tends to be a very seedy access road that runs parallel behind Las Vegas Boulevard) but it is literally right next door to a higher end gentleman's club called Sapphire. Regardless of that, the food is all organic, non-GMO etc, and very good. Considering how that kind of food is normally very pricey, I was surprised that the prices were in line with other non-organic restaurants of comparable style. Our server was very polite and knowledgeable, and the atmosphere was great. There was a little bit of a wait (about 15 minutes) according to the hostess, even though we observed several empty tables. We both assumed it was due to possibly being understaffed, so we hung out at the bar while we waited. In about 10-15 minutes the hostess came over to the bar and seated us. My only objection was that there were large television screens everywhere with baseball being played, but that 'sports bar' atmosphere is pretty much the norm in Vegas now. Luckily the sound was turned off. I would recommend it to anyone - local or tourist, just beware it is beside a 'strip club', so if you tend to be conservative or prudish you may have an objection to the location. But it doesn't really affect the experience in the restaurant at all.",

It was little hard to find this place since the lights from the strip club beside cover up the place mostly. I liked the ambiance very much and the place isn't very crowded usually at 7ish. Liked the free chips they served along with 3 different varities of salsa as starters and used a coupon from yelp to claim a free margarita. The burrito was huge and served 2 people sufficiently. I am sure this place is one of the good places to eat mexican food while in Vegas.",

Yelp also advises that many positive reviews come from the same IP address (someone is trying to increase ratings for business) sounds desperate! First if your coming with your family know that they share a parking and entrance doors are right next to each other for the restaurant and a gentleman's club so you pass a bunch of half naked sleazy bimbos prior to entering. They had one waitress running around doing everything .... she did good and was really nice despite the stress she must have been under. The food is ok but not worth the price at any means $19 for a steak quesadilla and $4.50 each street taco.... this price is without any side dishes. Our bill was $100 for 3 quesadillas (2 steak and 1 cheese), 6 street tacos and 2 sodas . Don't waste your money here you get better food for your money at Del Taco. We will not be returning.",

Since I had kids with me, they allowed us to sit in the dining room, which sits next to the bar. Food was mighty good, service was ok.  Waitress was non existent for most of the time we were there, but the food made up for that.  THAT was then, THIS is now.  I was told today that I wouldn't be able to sit in a booth adjacent to the bar for their happy hour deal.  The waitress asked 2 managers, but they would not accommodate us.  I can understand if the restaurant were busy, but it was a ghost town.  4 adults that were planning to order plentiful drinks AND food was not a good enough reason for management to bend the rules, to their favor.  This time, the server was nice, chips were good, but management dropped the ball.  Ended up walking out.  Drove out to Phat Franks clear across town for some grub. Glad we did.",

Management came to us asking about how our food was, including executive Chef Paco! (If you're reading this Chef Paco, the flan, and the tres leches were delicious! Definitely the best my family and I have tasted.) The food was extraordinary. My family ordered steak fajitas, chicken and shrimp fajitas, sopes, posole, and a carnitas burrito. The steak was like butter, so soft and well seasoned. The chicken was so moist and seasoned to perfection. The posole was authentic and the perfect ratio of pork and soup. The burrito was huge, and bursting with flavor with every bite. The salsa's that they give in the beginning was incredibly delicious. It wasn't too spicy and there was huge flavor in it. You could tell that this place has great quality in every way possible, and it shows from the moment you walk into this restaurant to the moment you walk out. Definitely a five star restaurant.

    "text": "What a pleasant surprise!! Certainly don't judge by the friendly neighbor--the restaurant is located next door to the acclaimed sapphire strip club. But to our surprise, we found a family-friendly classy Mexican joint that delivered delicious food with unparalleled friendly service. Chef paco will emerge from his kitchen to greet you himself, representing his independent restaurant in fine form. After a long night of drinking and partying, I came with 3 other companions seeking a wholesome breakfast (sure... It was lunchtime, but no matter). We tried fajitas, burritos and I had the huevos diversado--2 fried eggs lathered in green sauce atop tortillas, with rice and beans. Everything is well seasoned and constructed very well. There is a flan dessert which is exceptional--a family recipe says chef paco.   All in all, I cannot possibly express how much fun it was to find this surprise in Las Vegas, a short cab ride from the strip (we were at the SLS). Give this place a chance. Worst case scenario, you find yourself next door to help digest the meal.",

This is a place that thinks happy hour means \"serve half size orders at half the price.\" You're not getting a deal by ordering the $5 margarita, you're just getting half a margarita.   Additionally, the Mexican chili was nothing to write home about, I had no desire to finish it. The street tacos were definitely worse than Tacos El Gordo or Los Tacos. The carne asada taco was so rare that I wouldn't even call it cooked. The medium and mild salsas were ok, the habanero hot sauce tasted like it came from a grocery store bottle.  I did not eat the fajitas but my girlfriend was immediately sick from eating them and spent the next morning queasy with stomach pains.  $20 a plate for this? I'll go to Roberto's.",

The both of us have been craving Mexican food so after doing some good research on yelp, El Dorado seemed like a great restaurant - which it was!! You walk in and the restaurant is beautiful. I love the walls and decorations, really sets the mood and ambiance. The service was great as well! Once we were seated we were given waters and bottomless chips and salsa (three kinds of salsa!) plus the chips were so fresh!! Because we both checked in on yelp we also used the buy on get one free margarita deal! Our server helped recommend great dishes. It was happy hour and so we got our appetizer half off. We chose the shrimp taquitos. Then for the main entrees we had the carne asada taco plate and the beef enchiladas plate, which both came with rice and beans. Then, for dessert we got the tres leches cake. Oh my goodness we were filled!! Everything tastes so fresh and yummy.  The only reason for the 4/5 stars is because it was so difficult for us to find! We kept going back and forth on Industrial continuously passing Sapphire Gentlemen's club until we FINALLY decided to pull up the the club's main entrance and found El Dorado Cantina literally attached to the strip club lol. We were a little surprised and thought it might end up being a tacky restaurant, but it definitely wasn't! Loved it!!",

Now let's get to the good stuff, the food.  El Dorado serves authentic, flavorful, unique dishes. From veggie tacos to seafood dishes to fajitas, everything is fresh and full of flavor. The ambiance has a beautiful Spanish flare with dim mood lighting accompanied by upbeat Spanish music. And for dessert? Don't get me started on the Flan. It is creamy, smooth and delicious. If you are in Vegas and in the mood for Mexican, this place is a must!!!",

The sauces and flavorful food tasted very authentic and seemed to have all the flavors we love in Mexican food. She said what I was thinking when she mentioned a bed of lettuce on the bottom would have been great. Maybe because we're right in he middle of summer here in Vegas, but we both agreed that less rice and more food/lettuce etc would be perfect.  Our waiter was great. When making reservations, I had added that it was her birthday, but no special effort was made for that while we were there.  The tastiness of the food was amazing tho!!!",

    "text": "This place was AMAZING!!! We found it on yelp and decided to try it. It is practically attached to the Sapphire gentleman's club, which normally would have made us not eat here. But luckily we did. The food was the best we've had. Out waiters was AWESOME!!! We were seated right away on a Friday night and without a reservation. This place wasn't too crowded and looked great. When the hostess seated us as she was handing us our menus a waiter came up immediately with chips and salsa for the table and told us our server would be there shortly. Poof he showed up right away. Jorge introduced himself and asked if we wanted guacamole and took our drinks order. He was very personable and genuine. He made us laugh and treated you like he had known you forever. The guacamole was amazing, Jorge came and began making it right in front of us. He even asked if how spicy we wanted it. It was a little pricey at $16 but it was well worth it. We were a party of four and Jorge had at least five other tables but managed to make us feel like we were his only table. If Jorge was busy with his other tables he always had another person come and check in on us and see if we needed anything. When he came and took our order he was very knowledgeable about the menu. I was going to order something from the small bites menu because I wanted the sopes but he told me it wasn't a large sopes but rather 3 small silver dollar sized ones. He asked what I was interested in and made several recommendations. In the end I settled on the chicken enchiladas which were great. The servings were a decent size and enough to get you full. We were so stuffed we couldn't even eat dessert so we took it to go.   Definitely go try this place it is well worth it and everything is organic and non gmo. Don't be put off by it being so close to a strip club it is an amazing place. I regularly will take a day trip to Vegas from So Cal just to eat at my favorite restaurants and this one just made that list.",

The atmosphere was intimate, dark, sultry and inviting. The menu was full of fresh, delicious sounding dishes. I, of course, went for the carne asada tacos, because #classic. I was not disappointed in the least. It most certainly sated my taste for tacos. The sangria was to die for. You will not regret anything you order.   The only negative I would say is the lack of a la carte options outside of happy hour. I just wanted two tacos and some corn, but was surprised to find that the corn was $5, but the corn OFF the cob was $7. That made me go \"hmm\" for a bit so I just skipped it. I would have loved to try it, though. Maybe on my next trip. But seriously, go, don't worry about the \"Sapphire\" sign, and enjoy some delicious Mexican grub.",

It was a Saturday, I called and they were full but luckily was able to accommodate us. It was my wife, my bro, and his 3 lil girls(2,5,9). It was odd at first when we pulled up since it was next to a stripclub. We thought we had the wrong place, but luckily we didn't back out. We went in, very family oriented or for a group of adults. The please seems to clean out the rift raft. Management is very involved so you can tell they take pride in derive and quality of the food. We loved it!!! Even my nieces loved it. We will definitely go back!!!!! We will take some locals to show them something new. :) (I use to live in Vegas) try it out, let me know if I'm wrong. Try the rice!!

    "text": "Sat at the bar at 6pm on Christmas Eve. Behind the bar, the lovely Nell helped my server Joanna mix me up a wonderfully boozy margarita, with just the right amount of sour.  For dinner I had the Siegel Plate which came with heaping portions of char-grilled steak and chicken. The fried onions that it came with were cooked to dark, crispy perfection without the slightest taste of burning. The bursts of smoky sweetness from the onions perfectly complimented the grilled meat.  The 'cilantro rice' was very buttery, with not much noticeable cilantro, but it was a nice counterpoint to the sharp flavors from the rest of the dish. The asparagus was asparagus.  Even considering I was sitting at an empty bar in an otherwise very busy restaurant, the service was surprisingly attentive. Joanna and Nell were constantly busy running through drink orders, but they still found time to top off my water and salsa, and make small talk.  Overall, the food was a little bit overpriced considering its simplicity, but not at all outrageous for being just off the strip, and sharing a building with a Gentlemens Club.  The flan that I recieved in return for writing this review was dense and creamy and utterly delicious.  You should definitely eat here if you're looking for a place to escape from the strip for a while. Just be careful of garlic/onion breath if you plan on getting too close to the girls working next door.",

I was worried that with being organic that it would be smaller portions of the meat but the steak and chicken fajitas was a good size and I was definitely full and sarisfied. The flavors and preparation was outstanding. The service was great and the Assistant General Manager Martine was very sweet to us and it was a pleasure eating at a restaurant under great managent. We will definitely come back here and cant wait to!!",

    "text": "So this is the second time the wife and I have been here.  Our first time was Friday night last week after we checked in at the Palms and hadn't eaten all day. Honestly we were expecting a Tex-Mex type theme but were pleasantly surprised to find out that this is the real deal. That's right folks, genuine Mexican fare not that wanna be but never will be Mexican slop. We opted for the mole sampler and the street tacos as our entree. We chose to try the quesadilla as an appetizer and although it wasn't anything amazing it was good nevertheless. Now getting back to the dish I had which was the mole sampler.  The plate has a mix of 3 different types of mole, 2 red and one green. They all have there own unique flavors and characteristics about them but I found myself especially enjoying the green and the darker red of the two.  The lighter red has a genuine mole flavor that reminded me of both my moms and mother in laws mole which are both excellent.  I must say however that the darker one which I understand is made using both Chipotle peppers as well as Guajillo chiles had a very earthy, smokey flavor that really hits the palate and makes you appreciate all the labor that I'm sure goes into making this dish.  The green mole was just as tasty but obviously prepared using tomatillos and green chiles which by the way I totally love green salsas. Combine all three of these with their delicious white rice and refried beans and your choice of corn or flour tortillas and you have a meal fit for a king or queen. Long story short, if you're going to Vegas anytime soon: Don't miss this spot, oh I almost forgot to mention to not be freaked out when your cab driver or Lyft or Uber pull into a parking lot of a strip club. The restaurant and club share the same roof.",

Anyway, would have been a 20min wait for a table so we just plopped at the bar, took a few for the bartender to acknowledge us but once she did the service was great. Food tasted fresh and was tasty. Cilantro rice was my favorite, buttery and not over kill on the cilantro.  It is a bit more pricy then most Mexican food places, but the quality of the organic food is worth it to us.",

As long as you are not super conservative this should not offend you. They have their own separate entrance.  The restaurant is gorgeous. They had a great selection of beers however they were out of the ones we ordered, no worries they provided us with great alternatives. We ordered the gorditas to start with. I ordered the chicken milanessa and my bf ordered an asada burrito.  Both were very delicious, I only wish we had room for dessert  I will definitely be back and telling all my friends about this place!",

But it isn't. (It's only next to one, apparently.) I went there because I was looking for tacos on Yelp, this place popped up, and it was located on Sammy Davis Jr. Dr.   I really wanted to do a review from Sammy Davis Jr. Dr. (How cool is that for an address? Can you imagine seeing that return address on your Christmas card?)  Moravian pendants suspended from the ceiling? Red walls? Naugahyde banquettes? What's not to love? It's how I imagine Vegas used to be back in the day.   And the food was good, too. Local, sustainable, and non-gmo are not attributes I usually associate with Mexican food; but yes, it's good to have a delicious alternative that doesn't sacrifice taste. I'd never had an organic strawberry margarita before, but I'm a believer.   And the flan? I don't like flan. But everyone was right. This place is different. It has a much firmer, denser texture that is very pleasing and doesn't feel like a mouthful of separated yogurt. I'm believer.   Go.",

The only reason my wife and I walked in was because we took the time to drive off the strip and the reviews were so good.  It was quiet and completely separate from the strip club no direct entrances.  The Food was mediocre and the service was unacceptable.  The salsa was awful,  the guac even worse.  I had shrimp tacos and I will say the chipotle sauce was good but the rice was white steamed rice.  Wife had street tacos the carnitas were good but the carne and chicken were lacking big time.  Overall stay on the strip don't waste your time chasing a good meal.  Yelp is reliable but in this neck of the woods of Vegas I would say ratings will be off due to the strip clubs around.",

    "text": "Okay, so I found out about this place a little over a month ago and between my fiance and I we've already been there 10 times.   The food is AMAZING, every bite is flavorful and fresh! It's always perfectly seasoned and just simply declious. I've tried the empenadas and gorditas (both beef), guacamole, beef fajitas and my ALL TIME  FAV the steak bowl (I could eat it every second day). Sooo basically the food has been perfection so far and I've heard great things about the flan and the nachos.  The atmosphere is good, it's upbeat and feels young & fun. I like the way it's decorated and they have lots of roomy booths and plenty of TVs to watch games.  Nowwww on to the service. The first and second time (my fav visits) we had a wonderful waiter. I don't remember his name unfortunately but he had light brown hair and glasses and facial hair I believe. He was super enthusiastic and informative and very professional, he made our visit feel extra special.   One of the last times I had food from there, I actually called in for take out. I called 25 mins or so in advance and they said It would take 15-20 for our two meals (steak bowl + beef fajitas). I got there and was told to go to the bar, when I got to th3 bar no one knew about my order and all looked confused. The bartender who was helping me (who has an almost shaved head looks like he hates life) finally walked on the other side of bar and I could see him talking to a waitress who CLEARLY forgot about my order. The bartender NEVER apologized, the waitress never apologized, NO ONE even acknowledged the mistake..at all! The manager came by and said just a few minutes just to shut me up..which was annoying actually.  .....Fast forward 20 more minutes and my food comes, no discount, no sorries ANDDDD they still charged me $2 for my extra side of guac!!! Looool. As the manager gave me my food I told him at least they should have taken off extra guac, the 2 dollars does not make a difference in my life BUT to treat their future customers w more respect. He was like yess you're right..duhh!  I will definitely be back because of the food BUT good food can get old if the plave isn't run correctly over time.",

Everything else in my first review of El Dorado Feb '15 remains True; ingredients are fresh, meats the finest cut/grade (and non-GMO) and the jalapeno and cucumber margarita best EVER!

    "text": "Service was inconsistent, food was good quality but not to my taste. Bathroom was weird- some things were automated and others not. Felt like details were skipped.  When we walked in, we were asked if we had reservations. No, but the place was not full, and we were told it would be 20 min wait. Okay, so the four of us went and sat at the bar. We ordered water and got menus and chips and a trio of delicious salsas. Not two min later, we were whisked away to a nearby available table (five feet away).   It felt like the first server kind of pressured us to order, in the manner she phrased if we were ready. That was just the vibe I got.   The empanadas were TINY! Delicious though, but lacking much sauce and the side salad was tasteless and an after-thought- it seemed superfluous. Why bother?  After waiting for what seemed like ages, one entree was served- my husband's steak fajita platter. Gradually the rest of our group got served; but my husband had to point out they didn't bring the corn tortilla option he'd selected. So we all sat and waited for those to come, because we weren't going to eat in front of him. Maybe five minutes later the tortillas arrived and we started eating.  I'm an enchilada aficionado. Although they espouse to use fancy organic ingredients, neither variety I ordered was any great shakes, and too spicy for my taste (I like spice too). I didn't care for the refried beans nor the cilantro rice (both bland).  For about ten minutes I waited for the server to come back and ask how we were (those enchiladas needed sour cream). Finally I flagged a server down.   The worst part was having plates cleared from some of us while others were not finished eating, \"Are you done with this?\". I felt like they took my girlfriends plate away before she was!  After all plates cleared, here comes the ghostly waitress again. Trying to get us to order dessert. It didn't seem like they cared about our experience at all and things were inconsistent and spotty and really not very good at all. Would not recommend. C-",

When the waiter (who was great), offered us dessert, he let us in on the game, \"check in at Yelp and get a free flan,\" ahh, now it makes sense.   Overall I would recommend avoiding this place, the price is not justified by the food, and the atmosphere is like if a taqueria took over an Applebee's. Service is pretty good though.",

Chips & Salsa - Quite possibly the least eventful thing on their menu...easily passable.  Tableside Guacamole - Good but not the best i've had  Queso Fundido - Amazing   Chapulines aka Grasshoppers - I aint gonna lie it was hard to pick this up and eat it but once you do its not that bad. It basically taste like a seasoned sunflower seed shell. Would recommend trying once just to try it.   Quesadilla - Fire! If you don't like quesadillas then you need to rethink life.  Chicken Bowl & Carne Asada Bowl - Fire. Most favorite thing on the menu and that sauce is el fuego. Chicken Bowl is better than the Carne Asada Bowl though...  Right in the same building as Sapphire's if you are a guy you have no excuse not to come here...also if you are a girl you have no excuse not to come here....",

    "text": "I hate giving negative reviews but this is necessary. My group slowly trickled in within about a 10 minute frame so we sat at the bar. I sat right in front of the hallway leading to the bathrooms and immediately I could tell something was off. It smelled heavily like stagnant water. I tried to ignore it unless it bothered someone else too.   We sat at the bar for a good 15 minutes before we were even acknowledged by a bartender, additionally there was a tray of dirty glasses sitting in front of us that the bartenders didn't bother to move, eventually someone in my party moved it away from us. It took someone who was working there another 20 minutes before they removed it from the floor completely. Let's also preface in saying they weren't busy by any means.   Eventually our drinks came and we ended up moving to a table across the restaurant because we came there to eat and there was no way i could have eaten in the seat I was at. We're about 45 minutes into being in this place when we finally get our food order taken. Which is annoying.   Only half of our table got the complimentary chips and salsa? So 4 out of 8 people. It's not like we all could have shared because we were at a long table. It was just poor service.   I ended up being 3 margaritas in by the time any food hit our table, which is crazy because it's not like the drinks we're coming at any timely pace. When we were finally done we weren't offered boxes, the server just took our plates away without saying anything.   To top it all off there was some kind of mishap with our bill? They had to bring us 3. By the end of our experience everyone was just frustrated and extremely underwhelmed with our service.   I've been here before and had excellent service, but unfortunately this wasn't the case this time. Based on my experience this visit I probably won't be back, and if I do it won't be for a long time.",

Aside from the obvious entertaining costumes that walk through the door because this location is next to a strip club, this place is just average if not below. Every time we come to this restaurant (and we've given this place a HANDFUL of tries..) there always seems to be a problem no matter how well the staff know us. Almost every time, we strenuously express our food allergy towards avocado and even after 5 minutes of explaining and expressing our allergy, they STILL serve avocado on whatever we order and have to take it back. If you LIKE to be fed whatever they want to feed you with NO say so over what your allergic or sensitive to, this place is wonderful...  The ambience is nice. The service is TERRIBLE and VERY CARELESS. The Mexican food is almost one of the best in Las Vegas but that's NOT saying much if you know original Mexican food or even Tex Mex.   I'm sitting here writing this review as my fajitas are getting cold because they had to take our sides back...  Ugh... Would have rather gone to a more well known place on the strip...(not saying any names). We thought the STRIP was expensive but fajitas for ONE person here are $26.00... and on the strip they are $20.00. At least on the strip the food is higher quality and the waiters don't try to send us to the hospital every time we show up...  I eat Mexican food everywhere I go and never have I seen a place put jalepenos in everything and avocado on EVERYTHING...very annoying and working with a careless staff for a normal Mexican meal completely ruins an appetite that's for sure.",

Ordered the Mahi mahi tacos with rice and beans. Delicious. The rice is so fluffy and it had a sweetness to it. YUM. The fish in the tacos was tender and was complimented nicely with the fresh chopped mango and cabbage slaw. Other order was the carne asada burrito. Delicious. Perfect ratio of meat and everything that goes with it. The burrito was huge too. I LOVE that this restaurant is Non GMO and organic. Definitely recommend and definitely will be back again.",

The only gripe I have with this location is that it shares a building with a very large strip club, it just seems weird and attracts a different kind of crowd than a normal restaurant would. Once inside though, you would never know. The atmosphere was really pretty. My table ordered a pitcher of their jalapeno margaritas and they were really good! The chips and salsa brought to the table was amazing, i could eat the green salsa every day! I ordered the signature bowl and chose carnitas as my meat. It was $18 which was cheap compared to the rest of the menu. It was a very large portion for the price, well worth the money!! The carnitas were flavorful and tender, the white rice it came on was out of this world, i had to choose that instead of the brown rice because i had heard such good things about the white rice. It also had guacamole, refried beans, cheese, pico and lettuce. There was a queso sauce on the side, it didn't taste like queso or any cheese to be honest, but it was not bad. I was glad it was on the side, i wouldn't want it on all my food, it was good to dip a bite or two in. This is a small place that didn't seem busy, especially for a Friday night, i will definitely be making this a dinner spot when i am in Vegas next time.",

Tried the table side guacamole dip (their nacho chips are home made on site too), the waitress made the dip without onions per my request! Gourmet shrimp taquitos were what taquitos should be.

No complaints. Service was impeccable as well... everyone was so friendly. It is located next to a \"gentleman's club\" off the strip but no big deal and definitely worth the ride.

Odd place next to a strip club, but come to find out the restaurant is owned by the same owner of Sapphires. The decor is a great hip new look that seems to flow nicely with the vibrant red color. Was there to support the three squares restaurant week. Price fixed menu that included table side guacamole, three street tacos, and a dessert. The chips and salsa was good. The orange habanero salsa was, well you guessed it, HOT! The table side guacamole was awesome. The pork street tacos had slices of pickled habanero peppers on it. Was a good flavor! The Tres Leches cake was excellent. The best part of the dining experience was the waitress. Phenomenal service!",

    "text": "I want to like this place.... I really do. I have heard the food is pretty good! I like the concept of non gmo and  organic. I don't mind paying a little more for that either.  The table guac and salsas are amazing.... However that's all I had after an hour and a half! Not joking. Not even a refill of water. Finally had to leave. No dinner, and my drink that took 30 min to even get ordered never came. When I told the waiter that finally came around to take orders after 1 hour and 25 min being there that my drink never came and that I had to leave because my ride was on their way and couldn't even order now he said \"ok\" and went to the next person. That's it. Wow. Instead of being able to order a dinner at that point I asked him for at least more chips and water since our table had our salsas and the whole order of guac just sitting there with nothing to eat it with and all of our glasses empty... And had been for quite a while.... Nope, never showed even after another 15 min. No one ever once came by to refill water, to check on us, no one watching the fact that there was no chips to eat the table guac...  Never saw a person to even ask. Watched another table get seated 30 min after we were seated get ordered and served their food before the waiter even came around to take our order. Ride came, Had to leave.  I am beyond disappointed as I was starving both when I got there and also when I left. Service is awful, no staff to be seen. Waiters attitude was beyond terrible.  Btw, this was a party of 20. Special bday celebration. They knew we coming, and this was the service that was provided. Not cool.  Second star is just me being courteous.   ***FOOD IS COLD!!!!***** can I take away a star please!?!?  Yep, went back again only because the girls I was meeting chose the place.... Again the salsas and table guac was great. This time our waiter was pretty good.  Party of 3, ordered margaritas and when they came, woah! So much lime juice and \"agave nectar\" but little to no alcohol. Second one came in a rocks glass instead of margarita glass because they \"ran out of glasses\" really? I'm certain if I poured the amount of liquid in my glass into a shot glass it would not have even filled it. So much ice and, yep, more lime juice! Ugh my stomach! Ordered the street tacos. One shrimp, one (spicy)pork. Plate came a la cart. Would have been nice to know that. Shrimp was very strongly fishy smelling (I know better than to eat anything that smells fishy) and cold and my pork taco had exactly 2 pieces of meat in it. One piece was approximately 1/2 inch of actual meat and the other was an equal amount of complete fatty nothingness, inedible. Neither taco was even remotely warm. It is beyond obvious that all food is prepared well, if not days, in advanced and then only partially warmed to order. I'm not sure with how many multiple reviews of this place complaining of the same thing it is not yet rectified. And honestly I'm not sure how the health district is not yet aware of the problem. It's amazing no one has gotten sick yet.  Our party moved to the bar after dinner for one more round and even after asking for \"light on the lime juice\" was served an extremely acidic margarita again with no alcohol. When I asked for a solution, the bartender handed me a shot glass full of more \"agave nectar\" as the solution with no explanation. I tried a drop or two of that and then added more ice from my own water glass to try to solve the problem but really it was just way to sour and acidic to drink. As of now, 5 hrs later, my stomach has still not settled either from the \"fishy shrimp\" or the acid margarita I'm not sure but ugh.  So basically this place just has consistently given me a bad experience. I will not be going back. And I will tell and share my experience with others. Disappointing to say the least. Again I will say the idea of a organic and non gmo would be nice.... But not this place.  Save your stomach and go to any other hole in the wall for a better plate to be sure. And guaranteed it will be cheaper too! I didn't even go there, but our bill was $87 for 6 street tacos, table guac, and 6 drinks (little to no alcohol!). Pretty Pricey dontcha think!? Robertos and a six pack would be step up from this experience.",

Everything is incredibly fresh and well prepared. Even the chips and salsa were wonderful. I had the chicken enchiladas and black beans and it was completely amazing.

It's in the same building as Sapphire Gentlemen's Club, which I got from reading let reviews, but even knowing this I was still super confused. They don't even have a sign anywhere near the road or anything to help people out so if you don't know it's in the same building you're kind of screwed.   But other than that, it was amazing. I only eat organic so this place was awesome. From all local farms with no added anything. Had the table side guac (except we didn't have it made table side since there were only 2 servers on and it was pretty busy, they might want to staff better) but none the less it was amazing and then we all had enchiladas, so good! and the house margarita was huge and delicious! definitely will be going back soon since they are open 24 hours!",

We were later approached by a promoter selling strip club entry passes as great \"couples therapy\", which made for another laugh.          Apart from the questionable location this place was awesome!  Service was quick and friendly. We found out that our server was also a Michigan native  and long time globe trotting waiter.  Hours are are 24/7 just like it's neighbor the sapphire GC. Great for us as we were looking for a 3:30AM dining spot after a satisfying but tiring time at XS nightclub. Food was excellent. We started with a traditional complimentary Mexican appetizer of chips and salsa. We especially liked the burnt chipotle sauce. The guacamole was made table-side with generous peppers, garlic and onion mixed in with a mortar and pestle. The best dish was the Carne Asade street tacos, these were truly above and beyond.  One downside was that our server was very slow to get our credit card at the end of the meal, we had to just put money down and leave. It was also entertaining though because we saw that he was preoccupied serving a stripper which kept him distracted.",

Pulling into the parking lot on a Saturday night - it was confusing. Where do we go in?  Finally seeing the entrance on the side of the building, we knew we were in the right lot.  Walking in, we weren't sure *IF* we were in the strip club side or a restaurant. Realizing after the fact, a wedding had occurred and the wedding party was in the bar part of the restaurant, all dressed up making us feel like street bums.  Being escorted to the back past the DJ and the wedding party, there were a few small tables.  It was still very loud, but we gave it a try.  The food is AMAZING. Very good Habanero salsa, and we had the Al Pastor Street Tacos and Chicken Enchilada. Both had great flavor, good portion sizes and all the salsa you wanted to put on the food as well as eat with the chips. The food really is amazing. That's the reason for the 4 stars. I think next time we'll opt for carry out, and hope it survives the trip back to the hotel.  The only redeeming quality of this entire experience was our server Miguel, and the quality of the food.  But I have to say I have never been seated by a person wearing fish net stockings and lingerie. Hours later, I still can't shake the most bizarre dinner experience I have ever had in my life.  Blaring bad 80's music, drunk wedding party antics, Nascar on the big screen, and women walking around in lingerie? I guess that's why they say what happens in Vegas......",

My mom, sister and I arrived on a Wednesday afternoon around 4:30, and there were barely any other people in the place (not unusual for this time and day). We each ordered a margarita ($11) and they were huge, but they didn't do a lot for us. Not much different than other places.  The food is where it got bad. The chips come with three salsas, and it's $3.50 for a refill. The salsas are okay, lacking in flavor. I ordered the tacos al pastor(which admittedly is never very good in anywhere but a taco stand off the beaten path), and the meat was extremely dry and hard. The rice and beans had no flavor. My sister ordered the seafood enchiladas, which were supposed to have pacific shrimp, mahi, and scallops. What they came with was tiny bay shrimp, literally zero scallops, and the mahi was more like canned tuna. The sauce on her enchiladas was quite tasty though! My mom ordered the mole platter, which was the best of the three dishes. It came with three different kinds, which I haven't seen done before. All three were very flavorful and different from one another, and the portion was HUGE! Two or three people could have split that one dish. There only issue was the meat was a bit dry.   The plus side is the service was actually excellent! Our waitress even offered my mom ice for her injured knee :)  I'm glad I tried this place, but I definitely would not go back.",

Luckily the lighting in the restaurant was a bit dark. It helped not to see every detail of what I was eating.   In the end I was pleasantly surprised.

The food was excellent, as well as the service. The chef came out and chatted with us for a bit, which was really a nice (and unexpected) touch. We both tried the new sangria recipes for spring. Definitely recommend the red or white. They are loaded with fresh organic fruit, so ask for a spoon!",

I don't know whether they were trying to steal my Diamond VVS grill,  but a little bit about myself this cost over 1000$ per tooth , y'all do the math. So when the bill came I walked out. True story the waitress, manager, and dishwasher along with 2 sapphire security guards and bouncers care after us thinking I was trying to dine and ditch.  No it's fall disrespect. I tore my Achilles' tendon I'm not running from anyone. Long story short I paid the tab no tip because they cheap ass ownership / management/ chef was going to stick it to the waitress so I paid it obviously didn't tip. No one apologized the manager wanted to cool my next meal I said comp it now but he wouldn't. He only been manager for 5 weeks so I feel bad. The tacos you get upcharged 2$ for cheese extra for Guac too which is industry standard. Food was good but doesn't allow you to deliver the worst customer service and experience I've dealt at any restaurant. You expect to violate me, my property which is $8000 whether it was accident or stolen and then expect me to pay for $40 dollar tacos???!!!?! Y'all are crazy and I'll make sure word gets out about this. It sounds like the chef is charging everyone for everything Nickle & diming customers. Even the hostess orders food at sapphires instead of eating at 50% discount employee discount she gets.  The hostess encouraged us to write a bad review on yelp as well. She was only nice and understanding person within the situation. I told them to call the cops and they would probably side with me. The level of disrespect I've never seen in my entire life. The manager asked me to come back for a comp meal... there won't be a next time even though it wasn't his fault.",

I recommend anyone local or visiting to give this place a go, I mean if you don't your missing out so it's cool if you don't I'll still be there enjoying every bit of this place. I always have a different server and they never do me wrong. This time I had Grace and she made me feel like a Latin king.

So the restaurant is large and has plenty of tables and a huge bar area.. where a lot of people like to dine at after-hours. The staff/bartenders are pretty good in service..  So the chips and salsa they provide upon seating is very yummy! the chips are colorful and the salsas are spicy enough with a kick! I normally order the 3 tacos plate with rice and beans! Its so good and filling! guaranteed to make you nice and full as the servings is plentiful.  Overall it has tasty food with a nice environment. Its not the best mexican food Ive eaten but it seems to be quite healthy in its ingredients! fresh and organic! Come try this place out!",

    "text": "Wonderful service and great food! We were on our way to Area 51 when me and my friend decided to hit up a local organic restaurant, since we missed out on some Nicaraguan/Spanish food back in LA, we decided to check this place out.   Let me start off by listing some negatives about this restaurant, the parking and location. My friend and I, are very new to Las Vegas so of course we were somewhat surprised to see a strip club,gentlemen's club or adult store in every corner of Vegas and this restaurant just so happens to be directly in the same building of one of these gentlemen's club. We were confused on whether this was a restaurant within the facility or entirely on its own as the parking lot strictly stated that parking was for VIP club members and that non VIP members would be towed. Even though the restaurant is directly next to the club, we did not see any designated parking for the restaurant. We took the risk of a parking ticket and parked our car further down a mini parking lot for another adult gift shop even though we weren't going to shop there.   Besides these two problems I had absolutely no problem with the food at all. We took advantage of my yelp membership to get a free flan and it was quite delicious. The main meal we ordered was the Carne Asada Burritos and they were quite delicious. The chips that came with the salsa was also delicious and there was no problem with the serving portions as it was enough for 2 people to eat and we still had some leftovers from the chips! So there's no need to worry about serving sizes for the chips as usually free chips with priced refills are served underwhelmingly but not at this place! If I'm ever at Las Vegas again I'll be sure to come back for more as this was one of the best organic food options out here in Las Vegas! Just please work on that parking issue!",

Cheese enchiladas, carne asada tacos, rice, salsa+chips, al pastor tacos and flan were selected.  Al pastor tacos $3 each were very tasty, the tacos were filled with meat, guac, and onions. The pulled pork was very juicy and enough fat balanced the fresh and greasy side.   On the other end, carne asada was too dry. Very hard to swallow. But good portions.   Rice was very unique. Tasted a little bit coconuty with buttery taste. I finished the whole plate of rice, which I had never did with red Mexican rice.  Flan was my favorite. It was very rich and thick, but not too sweet at the same time. Just enough of sweetness and enough of milky taste.  Service was fantastic. Our waiter was very attentive and smiley. Patiently waited for us while we were browsing through the vast selections of tasty Mexican food.",

We just looked at each other and said let's keep an open mind...lol. We are so glad we did. Chips and salsa are to die for and green and red salsas are authentic n yummy. We ordered the steak lettuce wraps w guacamole, pico de gallo, etc and the refries beans n rice came with it . Food was so tasty and authentic Mexican cooking . Ambience laid back n chill . Place is open 24 hrs . Loved it. Would def call me back PS. Margaritas are the real deal awesome  and STRONG :)",

And brought me this delicious orange ice cream dessert. HIGHLY recommend!",

I would recommend asking for extra salt salt and hot sauce if you're stuck with this option.",

This restaurant is located next to it, and you enter from outside. You will need to park in the same parking lot as the strip club.  Anyways, their tableside guacamole tasted fresh and delicious! We also had their street tacos, quesadillas, and flan for dessert. They do have a happy hour here, so come early to enjoy their margarita. Plus they do get pretty busy during dinner time, so even more reasons to arrive early.  As far as ambiance goes, it's fairly dark inside but it's definitely a comfortable casual dining environment.  Definitely worth checking this place out!",

My friend was so hesitant to get out her car because she had her kid with her.  LOL.  The entrance is actually right next door to the entrance of the strip club.    Upon entering he atmosphere was busy and lively.  The staff was very nice and accommodating.  Our server was Juan and he made sure we had the best service!    The food was pretty decent.  I highly recommend the table side guacamole and if you're daring, try their grasshopper dish.  Deep fried and super flavorful.  It's not as bad as people think.  I also absolutely recommend their flan!!  Probably the best I had in town.",

If this place was in the San Fernando Valley, it would have been PACKED. But it was a little slow when we visited on a Thursday night. Music was lively, but at a reasonable volume, which allowed us to talk.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating. I can highly recommend the shrimp enchiladas and the carne adada taco.  The Cadillac margarita was good, not great. Same for the tableside guac. It tasted \"homemade\" but the flavors never really blended.  Beware the \"hot\" guac option; they are not fooling around.  I'll be back next time I'm in Vegas.  Oh, and don't be put off by the fact that it's next to a strip club. They don't appear to be connected.",

The first good sign was the margarita with salt on a single side of the glass and the woman making fresh guacamole on the restaurant floor. The cilantro dressing on the salad is not to miss. Every single detail adds up to an amazing experience: unpretentious, quality food with immaculate service. This is my new go-to restaurant in Vegas.",

They use a mustard and vinegar dressing that is much more tangy and far less salty but tasty.. You can't go wrong with steak tacos and anything shrimp-related. Shrimp burritos and shrimp enchiladas are not-to-miss.  Try the flan. Even if you don't like flan, it is the best in Las Vegas.  You have to try their rice - it is delicious. Don't come on a calorie-counting day, though. Great service, great food and you will leave satisfied.  It is pricey but you get quality food that is well worth it.",

    "text": "While three of my incredibly intoxicated friends received lapdances and slid crisp one-dollar bills into bras and panties at Sapphire Gentlemen's Club, I, the sober one, spoke with their server about their food. She told me, \"Hey, we don't have our kitchen up right now (7 pm), but you could go next door (to El Dorado Cantina), buy some tacos, and bring it in here.\"   \"Oh, great idea!\" I replied back.   She replied, \"Could you get me a shrimp taco? I'll give you a kiss.\"   \"No kiss is necessary, but I got you on that shrimp taco, girl!\"   I ventured next door and sat at the bar where I ordered twelve tacos and an order of flan (complimentary with a Yelp check-in) to go. Regarding their tacos, they offer two kinds:  - Street Tacos (3 for $13.50): Carne Asada, pulled chicken, carnitas, al pastor, cochinita, corn rajas, and cabeza.  - Signature Tacos (two per platter and range from $14-$20): Queso Mexicano, Cactus, Veggie, Childe Verde Pork with Chicharron, Shrimp, Grilled Mahi, Octopus and Chorizo, Lettuce Wraps, Salmon, and Langostino.  I got three each of the al pastor, shrimp, octopus, and chorizo, and langostine.   Once finished with my order (only 15 minutes), I carried my precious cargo, which sat in delicate plastic bags, and proceeded to return the strip club next door. As I entered, I saw two of my friends walk the opposite direction of me and yell, \"Dude, we got kicked out!\"   \"Damn, dude, I just paid fifty bucks to get in, like half an hour ago, and you already got kicked out? AND I GOT TACOS!\"   The bachelor and third member of the party stumbled ten feet behind and yelled, \"Guys, my lap dance didn't even finish.\"  \"What happened?\" I asked the security guard.   \"I mean, just look at one of your friends. He's a mess.\" He angrily told me. ***Queue both of us watching a man lay down onto a bench and hump it.****  So as we sat outside, I said, \"Well, I can't wait to eat some dinner. Damn, I'm hungry.\"   I opened up a box and eyed the shrimp taco I planned on donating to the server inside. As I was about to sink my teeth into this masterpiece -- with purple tortilla, bright orange shrimps, red cabbage, and freshly chopped cilantro -- one of the members in the group grabbed my taco (that's what she said) and started eating it.  \"Dude! What are you doing?\"   Then, if things weren't worse, he took the rest of the taco and mumbled, \"It's a bit dry.\" He then opened up the container where the flan resided and dipped the entire taco into it and devoured the entire thing.  \"This taco sucks BALLS.\" He yelled.   \"WTF, man. That's the flan!\" I replied.   So I neither recommend or not recommend the flan.  Attempt #2, I grabbed the second shrimp taco and ate that baby down. A little dry, but a great balance of savory and crunch.   I then tried the octopus and chorizo, which was also well-made. I didn't get enough chorizo, but the masterfully cooked octopus carried it. Also, I'd recommend the langoustine, which immersed in garlic butter and served with fresh guac.   The al pastor was ok. I wouldn't recommend it.  So yeah, I tried just about all the tacos, and even though my friends just got kicked out of a strip club and I felt pissed to have just dropped $50 to speak their server, albeit sweet, the tacos helped salvage the night. (This also included one of the members of the party to forcefully grabbed me by my balls while yelling, \"I dropped $1000 here. I can do whatever I want.)   F***, man. What a night.  ***** Plenty of parking is available. Just bring your rosary because you might need Jesus there.",

For me, the food is just \"ok.\" I've been to El Dorado many times and tried a variety of dishes. Each time I come away thinking that there could be more flavor to each dish.   I think I don't love the choices that they make about their dishes--the albondigas soup, for example, is filled to the brim with large chunks of veg. And the broth lacks a rich flavor. It's one of my favorite soups and I have stopped ordering it here because I am always disappointment.   I had heard that their tacos were legendary and couldn't wait to try them. After trying them MANY times, I find them to be just ok. The meat was not flavorful and lacked any char. And there are so many places to get an exquisite taco in this town for 1/3 of the price. I've tried many appetizers, their tosatda salad, their veggie bowl, and a few fish dishes. And it's fine food. But not great food for me.  I'm always missing spice and flavor for my dishes here.   This is one location where the ambiance and vibe out paces the offerings. All that said, I will definitely return--it's a great place to take visitors from out-of-town. And it's a local business that is (rightly) proud of their non-GMO offerings.  I don't love it, but I respect what they are doing here.",

I've had the steak and shrimp fajita, which was pretty delicious.  carne asada tacos were awesome, probably the best I've had.  I don't know what they do to their steaks, but it's freakin good.  also had the mexican corn and i think i ate that in about 2 min.  I would get that every time i come here.  I highly recommend this place, it's open 24 hours and it's delicious food.  it's not the cheapest place in Vegas, but considering the quality of the food it's worth it.  way better than the overpriced food they serve you on the strip.  so come here and check it out for yourself.",

    "text": "Arrived early, we had reservations. Waited for them to put the table together not a problem. Went to the bar, ordered a $7 margarita from happy hour menu. Asked for no salt, got salt on it. Figured find not big deal. Until I took a sip, it was a blended margarita I figured that it got in my drink. I had them make it over. So I waited 30 for basically 1 drink, and then the re make. When there was only 2 other tables In the place and a guy at the 3 ppl at the bar. The drink was still salty!!' So salty I couldn't even take 3 sips, mt throat started to feel dry. The same thing happened to my friend who ordered one on the rocks they remade it. Still salty!!!!  Then after we are seated eating our chips and salsa, they make us get up so they can move the table. Since, 2 people cancelled on us. They could've done that before we sat down. I ordered the carnitas burrito. It comes with a side of white cilantro rice. The rice taste like if someone threw in the half bucket of butter in it. The carnitas was so salty, I unscrewed the pepper shaker and drowned it with salsa so I can try to eat. The guacamole was good inside. I should've just gotten that and tortillas. After our meal we used the YELP in for our free flan. We had 9 people only 4 used the thing for the free flan. Then we get told by the server the kitchen told him it's only one free flan for table. The flans cost $9 so I can see why they are saying this now. If they didn't want that it should specify one per table. They gave us the other 3 if we wrote a review on Yelp. So here it is. If you want to gain 5 pounds of water retention, eat and drink here. They also don't tell you when you ask for things you'll be charged extra. My friend got charged $2 extra for her corn. The server asked on the cob or off. She said off it wasn't until the bill came we noticed the $2 charge. And the corn came after they were done with their fajitas. They asked for both types of tortillas for Charged extra. Sour cream, charged extra. Tell people,  is an extra charge when they ask for certain items.",

Back in those days, when they actually appreciated their business the street tacos were like, $6.50 for 3, and came with a small side of rice & beans. THAT was an excellent value! Now that they are consistently busy they have doubled the price of the street tacos & they also now charge for the small side of rice & beans that used to come free when you ordered the street tacos. So, this place went from being good, unique Mexican food at a great value, to being decent, overpriced Mexican food. Because of this I will cut my visits to this restaurant in half. I feel like it's a real slap in the face to their regular, longtime customers who have been there since day one & helped them advertise with check in's, good reviews, etc. back in their early days when they were struggling to get people through the door. I don't like to patronize establishments that are lacking in integrity & customer appreciation.",

We ordered food including quest fundido, carnival dinner, burritos, and street tacos. The tacos were okay. Some really good, some awful. The carnival plate was ridiculously average and bland at best. Quest fundido was good not great. Service was terrible. I won't make the effort to try it again as I feel we had a large enough taste of the menu.

(I am not counting the over-priced tourist traps at Strip hotels-I care too much for the health of my lungs to venture inside). El Dorado has a lovely interior and lots of free parking...the latter courtesy of the huge \"Gentlemen's\" Club adjacent to it. Actually the security around the place is formidable,so there should be no worries about your safety or that of your vehicle in the otherwise seedy area.  The dining experience was scrumptious: easily the finest guacamole-prepared table side-that I have found north of the Rio Grande. I did the Tropical Mahi,my companion the Salmon...both brilliant. Also had an authentic Mexican soup with pork that was wonderful. The deserts-especially the flan-recipe courtesy of the chef's grandmother was sensational. Lots of gaudy adjectives here...but the food is truly deserving of them,and the prices were equitable. The only other Mexican restaurant in Vegas close to this level is Mundo,but I prefer the warmer atmosphere of this place. I shall return.",

That's why I went through the trouble of creating an account because the service changed so much I wanted to let management know. So let's try this again below is my review and also a test to see if yelp is actually reliable.   Wow!! We first went there about 3 months ago the food was alright decent for being Mexican food but we loved the customer service great waiter and service manager was friendly, great at checking up on us and making us feel welcomed. However we just went back last week in the morning and the service manager was a different person and she was a nightmare didn't greet us, didn't help, you could tell they were busy and she walked around looking but didn't bother to help. If I can remember clearly her name was meleny? The waiters all seem like they were new, very scattered brained. And the worse part you could hear screaming from the kitchen. Someone obviously stressed out by the rush. Not very professional at all. Just a tip for the owners get your old team back together, that was True customer service. At least that's why we went back, not sure if we will be going back with the change. Better training too, you can tell who the new people are, that's never a good thing especially if they can't keep the standards from before. Management needs improvement.",

    "text": "I wish this warning was enough to deter us from coming here because our whole night was a mess. We had a reservation for 8, switched it to 6 but even then when we got there they still didn't have space for 6, they gave us a table for 4 and had us squeeze. They also did not have enough menus for us, we had to share 2 for 6 people. Then two of my friends ordered Moscow Mules when we ordered our meals but our waiter didn't let us know that the restaurant ran out ginger beer until 10 minutes later. They also ran out of lids for togo drinks. Manager blamed all of the shortages on a larger party but none of us felt like that was an excuse for all the things that went wrong tonight. Also, make sure not to bring your kids here because it's attached to a strip club. Just awful experience not sure how it's rated as the number one Mexican restaurant in Vegas.",

My friend had a veggie burrito and she enjoyed it quite a bit. The margaritas where delicious to wash it all down. Strongly recommend the staff as well, they were super attentive and friendly.",

It goes by the name \"El Dorado\" and I would have never known it existed if it was not for Yelp and my good friend who is a chef.  When you arrive... go ahead and park in the giant parking lot and don't feel as sketched out as I did. I'm sure there's a good amount of people who actually parked here for the food.  The service was very welcoming and the starter chips and salsa were bomb. Honestly, I could have just been satisfied off of that and their amazing salsa.   We decided to go and order all of the happy hour. This is where it kinda went down here for me... The food was just A-L-R-I-G-H-T. I ordered all of the street tacos, taquitos, tostaditas, and empanadas. Presentation was great but food was nothing too special tbh. I guess with all of the great recommendations, I expected a lot more. But the establishment is clean and I enjoyed the experience.  I will visit in the future and try their actual menu items to really get the full experience. The people around us looked to really enjoy the place and food. I could easily choose this as a hang-out spot.",

    "text": "This is for their 2017 Las Vegas Restaurant Week three-course lunch menu.  Establishing a 24/7 Mexican restaurant next to a busy strip club has to be one of the best ideas ever. Drunk ass people and tacos are match made in heaven. All right, let's get to the review:  First course: Guacamole and chips - This was the only first course option offered. I was expecting an individual serving of guacamole and chips. Instead, I received a tiny serving of guacamole and had to share a bowl of chips with the rest of my party.   Second course: I went for the lengua street tacos, but there's the option to choose whatever kind you desire. Except you can't mix and match. The platter comes with three street tacos and a side of beans and rice. The tacos weren't bad, and thankfully I didn't taste any of the \"texture\" that's sometimes left on lengua. The rice was one of the best parts of my meal, to tell you the truth.  Third course: Churros with Mexican chocolate sauce was the only dessert option offered. The warm, deep fried churros were filled with caramel, and the sauce was cold. Not a fan of the combo.  Other: Orders were coming out at different times. My guess was the restaurant was understaffed and only one person was in charge of delivering orders to the tables.   Overall: El Dorado isn't a restaurant that  I would drive out of the way for, especially considering the variety of cuisine offered nearby both off and on The Strip. But hey, this spot is especially convenient if you want some grub and booze after visiting the strip club.",

I've been to El Dorado a handful of times now, my friends love Mexican food;) This is my choice of Mexican restaurants in town.   El Dorado has a wonderful setting and spicy fare with a great authentic representation of classic dishes.   What draws me here is the fact that they select their ingredients free of pesticides, steroids, etc. They have Vegan and gluten free menu items!  First time I was here with a friend who is Vegan, they went above and beyond in accommodating my friend.  This alone speaks volumes. My favorite here is the Albondigaa soup, it's quite tasty and is a meal in itself.  Yes, it is- tortilla chips make a great dipping 'utensil'. A tie for my favorite here are some of the desserts: the Chef's Singatire and Tres leches cake.  The interior is quite attractive, tables all around with the bar situated in the middle. They also have a back room, which I believe can be used for a private party.  Four stars- parking. It's not the most ideal parking situation since it shares it with another establishment;)   That being written ha!  Do not wait to come here, take an Uber or simply drive here you won't regret having  anything you order!",

However, we were seated before at least 2 or 3 other tables were served.  But, once we were being served, I think her name was Erika, that changed everything! Erika was so nice and was accommodating! She made sure to check on us for drink orders and more tacos! (The sampler is good for $10)   Even the chef came out to meet us (which is maybe why our service got better. Either way, it really made a difference!)   And the desserts, delicious! We had the flan and the pumpkin chimichangas!   Definitely, will go back!",

The girl said it's busy and we had to give your table when you think they would hold it for at least 10 min for such a big party. Plus there was nobody outside and two tables were open. Then to add insult to injury I felt like I was in a sauna because their a/c was apparently not working. The tacos were plain and boring. Flavorless al pastor with chopped pineapple on them.

Once inside you'll see the place is not terribly big but all and all it has a very good atmosphere.  All the food on their menu is organic and you can certainly taste it.  I personally ordered the carne asada burrito which came filled with very tasty meat as well as fresh and very green guacamole.  The burrito itself did not have beans in it but I had them add refresh beans which tasted amazing.  The plate had a side of cilantro rice which I typically don't like but theirs is quite flavorable.    My wife ordered the three taco plate, all of which came topped with pineapple and sided with the cilantro rice and your choice of black or refried beans.    Coming from so cal is highly recommend the food here as a must try in Vegas!  Cons: for some famalies they may find the fact this restaurant is housed and sharing a wall with a strip club off putting. They also share a common parking lot.  The house salsa was very tasty, but after the first small dish they charge $3.50 for additional salsa which seems a bit excessive.  The last cons for me was prices were a little high. The asada burrito was $16.50 and the taco plates are $13.00.    Service was very polite, but refills took a bit of time to arrive and considering it was not horribly busy if be concerned about this should the place be handling a full crowd.",

    "text": "El Dorado Cantina is making some really solid Mexican food in the area. I've enjoyed this spot every time I went here.  I first saw this restaurant when I was driving around in the area, and just wanted to try something new. Even though it had just opened, I wanted to see if the high ratings were legit.  It actually took me a few passes to find this restaurant. For some reason, it said that it was right where the Sapphires gentlemen's club was at, and I couldn't believe it. But once I pulled into the parking lot, it was indeed right next to Sapphires. But, keep in mind, these are 2 totally separate businesses.  When walking in, you can tell that they put a lot of effort into making the dining room look amazing, and it does. The lighting, placement of tables, the bar area.. Everything was really thought out very well.  The current happy hour menu is a lot different than the items I had before on my last visit. The new happy hour is $1 tacos, well drink, and cheap beer specials. I was able to order one of each of the street tacos, about 5 in all.  While waiting for the tacos, we were given their chips and salsa. We were given a tomatillo salsa, a habanero , and chipotle one. The chipotle one was my favorite, I liked the smokiness of it. I also thought that the habanero one was really good, especially from the heat of the peppers.  We ordered a guacamole and ghost chili salsa for some side dishes, both of which are made table side. The guacamole is great, and the server seasoned it extremely well. The ghost chili salsa was extremely spicy at first, but the more you eat it, the more you will get used to it. We couldn't eat it at first, but by the end of the night, it had been demolished.  The tacos then came out. On happy hour, the street tacos are a really great deal. They are big and full of wonderful stuffs. My favorite of the evening was the al pastor taco. The sweetness of the pineapple contrasted with the smokiness of the tender pork. But, I have to say that all the tacos are really great.  I would say that the prices are pretty good for what you receive, for the most part (except my friend didn't think the $17 shrimp cocktail was worth it). Happy hour is great here, so for those who want to give this place a shot, that would be the best time to go. The chef, Paco, was even kind enough introduce himself to us, and asked us how everything was, which we all thought was pretty good. If I'm in the mood for some upscale Mexican cuisine, but will still give you great value for how much you pay, El Dorado Cantina will be my spot!",

The server (omar) was kind enough to tell us that if we checked in through yelp, we would get the flan for free.  Now onto the review of the food. The salsas, three types, are all very flavorful.  My favorite is the green and the medium red one.  The tableside guac is delicious, and we'll worth the high price.  The sea food enchiladas is very good,  the combination of the creamy sauce and the scallops work well.  The chicken taquitas was crispy!  The flan was well made and is creamier than the other flans I've previously had.   Also, reservations on Monday are necessary, otherwise the wait can extend to 2 hours.  Another option is to hover around the bar to find a bar seating for dinner.",

    "text": "I love El Dorado Cantina! This is one of the best Mexican restaurants in the valley, hands down. Probably THE best.  I love Mexican food and have struggled to find really good Mexican restaurants here. What originally drew me in was the advertised organic and non-GMO ingredients. That's SUPER hard to find here! I was even more impressed that a Mexican restaurant was offering this kind of quality. So, of course, I had to try El Dorado Cantina.  I've had a few different items here, and all have been excellent. I would agree that the service can be spotty, but it's usually pretty good. Be sure to book a reservation if you're planning to go at a busier time. I tried to drop in very early on a Saturday, and they were booked for the entire evening!  I don't think you'll go wrong with any of the food, but if you like flan, you've got to give dessert a try here. I had not had good flan since leaving California 6 years ago until I tried El Dorado Cantina's version on my very first visit to the restaurant. The server strongly recommended it, and WOW! It's the real thing.  If you love good Mexican food and appreciate the organic, non-GMO aspect of food in general, you've got to try this place! :)",

Ordered right away because we knew what we wanted as soon as we looked at the menu.  There was only 2 other diners, who got served soon after we sat down.  Yet somehow it took them an hour to serve us.  And somehow other customers that came in in the meantime were getting served first.  Um, hello?  Do you even know how to run a restaurant?    Oh but it gets worse.  After waiting an hour they finally brought out our food and then even though I had ordered a vegan entre they had sprinkled cheese on my food and I had to send it back and wait even longer to get my food.    But thats not all.  The food itself was incredibly bland and tasteless compared to the Mexican food I make at home....and I'm not even Mexican!  I'm just a regular american guy but somehow I know how to cook better mexican food than this place!    With all the ranting and raving about this place being so high quality it is literally as disappointing as can possibly be.  The service is unbelievably poor...literally the longest wait I've ever had in a restaurant.  And the food is incredibly expensive and lacking in flavor.  And I'm not even sure all the ingredients are actually organic and healthy because something that I ate there did upset my stomach, which shouldn't have happened for the quality of food they claim to be using.  If you want good mexican food apparently you gotta make it yourself in this town.",

Once again I was impressed because there was a taco special and I wanted to try it all. Once I heard the sale price I was excited to get the carnitas, and carne asada. Both were great. Carnitas was awesome and filled with flavor. The salsa is AWESOME and I couldn't resist trying the pozole soup because no Mexican place has it in New England. That was great too. I wish I could teleport this place to Massachusetts. Oh fresh made margaritas too.",

    "text": "The other 4-5 star reviews here are very suspicious. Based solely on the Yelp reviews, a group of 4 of us went to dinner on Sunday night-very quiet inside, maybe 1/2 full with not one person sitting at the bar. We knew something was wrong when it took 15 minutes to get the chips and salsa and  a few chips were in the basket- not your typical \"overflowing basket o chips\" as is usually the case at a good Mexican restaurant. The salsa was actually quite good.  That unfortunately was the highlight. It then took another 15 minutes to order drinks and Table Side Guacamole and place our entree order,  After another 15 minutes and after us asking, we got our drinks- but no guac yet. We waited about 20 more minutes and asked for the check. Never got the guac and didn't care to wait for the entrees suspecting they'd be as bad as the service- plus we didnt want a 3 hour meal.  Clearly they were understaffed, but we felt that the whole place did not live up to any of these suspicious Yelp reviews, It also looks nicer in the pictures than it really is- pretty cheaply decorated.  On the cab ride back to our hotel we told the cab driver the reason we went was the reviews. He too said he recently went and had bad service that took forever and he has no idea how they got these reviews.  One guy in our group was wary from the minute we pulled up and he was right- this place is just bad news. It is sitting on a skanky side street next to a strip club for a reason- most horny drunk guys wont care about a bad meal.",

The sangria is excellent and the table side guacamole is nothing less than fantastic. The seafood enchiladas were exceptional and DONT FORGET to save room and order the churros and especially the flan. I DO NOT LIKE FLAN. It's a texture thing, too gelatinous, but this flan is magical. It's creamy and smooth and just so good it's hard to describe. Don't wait to go to el dorado cantina and also, it's 24 hours, even better!!!! Enjoy!!!",

The Carne Asada tacos were so tender & flavorful they practically melt in your mouth & the handmade corn tortillas are sweet & taste amazing.  The cheese Enchiladas were outstanding & overall it was a great dining experience.  We even got to spend some time with the chef \"Paco\" as he brought out his homemade Flan and talked about the ingredients & history of this version.  It was without a doubt the creamiest & most flavorful Flan I've ever had.  This place is a little on the expensive side but again it's well worth it.  I'll be back for sure!",

It was a late lunch, and my wife and kids had already eaten, but I was determined to experience this place and their mole, so what do you do? Leave the wife and kids in the car! As long as you don't go next door. Horrible, I know, but they were tired and sleeping and I figured it would make a good Vegas story. To be clear, I went to the restaurant, not the place next door. I had a margarita, and the mole. Service was great, the manager came by and checked on me, as well as Chef Paco, who personally brought out my dessert flan. The mole was fantastic, 3 kinds, but portion was huge so had to take some home. And the family was safe and sound and still asleep when I got back.",

The cilantro rice tasted a bit buttery and reminded me of a Vietnamese dish called xoi. The quesadilla had three types of cheese and it was very filling. The chips and salsa were good but it was weird that you have to pay to get a refill. Overall come here if you have money and looking for good Mexican food. It's pricey due to the food being GMO. BUT the flan is LIT. It totally makes up for the price. Thanks Chef Paco!",

The tomatillo salsa was so flavorful and the service top notch. We never waited for anything, Enrique tended to us the entire night and he truly is one of a kind. He was very friendly, attentive and just made our dinning experience a True delight. We ordered the table guacamole, queso fundido, corn off the husk, albondigas, pozole, Milanesa, tacos de carne asada and for dessert a flan and fresas con cream. It was all delicious and the drinks are fantastic! For a great time, wonderful food and chill ambiance this is definitely the place, enjoy!",

I don't care for pork but I loved this. Also tried the deep-fried ice cream - again, sooooo good.  The coating was nice and crisp with a delicious vanilla/cinnamon flavor.

    "text": "So this is a realtime as-it-comes review.  So far I have had to drive here especially from my hotel on the central strip. I'd hoped I could walk but it's a 15 minute drive so kind of out of the way.  So anyway, I pull up to where the navigation is taking me and I hesitate because everything is lit in blue and the vast majority of signage on this middle-of-nowhere place says this is a strip club. Highly dodgy.  El Dorado Cantina has a small sign and and entrance of its own next to the strip club entrance and as I am here in my own I must have looked really suspicious parking up and walking towards the entrance.  The doors are all blacked out so I wasn't sure what I'd get when I opened them but I'm glad I came in.  Boom!  Instant atmosphere! The place is buzzing and I am greeted by Kim, the general manager, who suggests I sit at the bar as I am on my own and starts up a friendly conversation. He asks how I heard about the place and I tell him I saw a sign on the freeway and it said it was rated one of the top 50 places to eat so I pretty much came straight here. He tells me if I check in I'll get a free flan dessert.  Double boom! :)  As soon as I sit down I'm presented with a menu that looks delicious, and a really big bowl of tostadas with 3 types of salsa that all taste delicious. Proper tostadas too, not at all like the ones I am used to in most places back home. They gave me a glass of ice water without asking as well. This is rare for me.  I see the Mahi tacos and order some. They arrive and are a bit bigger than I am expecting for the price, but that's cool. First bite... Delicious. So are all the other bites.  Half way though eating them Kim returns to ask how I'm doing. He addresses me by my name! Dang it! How does he remember my name? Anyway, I tell him it's all good :)  And then I finish my tacos. They suffered catastrophic containment failure half way through and I had to finish the second one with my knife and fork... But I don't care. These are the best tacos I have had since I was in Mexico. I don't know for sure but I am pretty sure these are freshly made soft taco shells.  Just as I am about to write \"I'm now stuck in an awkward situation where my taste buds want more but my stomach says no\" I'm asked if I am ready for my free flan. Decision made for me.  This is awesome!  I'm waiting for the flan right now. I have high hopes for it and I'm sure I won't be disappointed!  But wait, there's more! They have TVs. Lots of them. And they are showing the Steelers game. And the Steelers are winning! Here we go Steelers!!  And I still have most of my bowl of tostadas left, so I can munch on them until that flan arrives (they said it will take 5 minutes or so).  Just as I am thinking I'm done with the tostadas, my flan arrives. And it's just right! Absolutely delicious and the portion size is perfect too.  So there you have it. Until now I didn't think I could possibly have a reason to return to Las Vegas, but now my favourite Mexican restaurant is here. The only way this place could improve is to be located on the top floor of one of the big hotels on the main strip, with a view of the Las Vegas skyline (but still be as accessible to regular customers as it is now).  Can you open a branch in London please? :)",

Don't get me wrong, the food is good, just not good enough to justify the prices they are charging, I had the carne asada burrito and it was good but definitely not better than the carne asada burrito I get for half that price at the local Alberto's behind my house! Also thought the location of this place was a bit quirky as it shares its walls with the largest strip club in America. We had to pull over and ask a parking lot attendant where the restaurant was because the strip club was pretty much covering it up. Service is good and at the end of the meal the chef came out and spoke to our party for a minute which was nice.",

We were greeted by a friendly hostess and seated immediately. Our server came quickly and took our drink order. We were served fresh tortilla chips and 3 different salsas, which were explained to us by our server. We ordered the Tableside Guacamole. Our server explained all of the ingredients while he prepared it. It was super fresh and flavorful. When the margaritas came my brother joked to our waiter that they were big enough to go swimming in, and there was no shortage of alcohol. For the main course my wife ordered the Carne Asada Burritto and both my brother and I ordered the Siegel Plate. The amount of food was overwhelming and everything was seasoned and cooked to perfection. The part I loved the most is that there were no heavy beans to fill me up. For dessert we shared the flan which also was amazing. Chef Paco came out and introduced himself and his passion for this restaurant shows through his unbelievable recipes. This is a must try if you live in Vegas or are visiting the area.",

    "text": "This 5/5 rating is due to their phenomenal service and amazing quality of food.   A friend visiting from out of town requested authentic Mexican food and this place was at the top of my list due to its high Yelp rating. We were lucky enough to be there on The day when stars aligned - National Taco Day and Taco Tuesday happening at the same time. Also, El Dorado was offering $1 Tacos from 4p-6p in honor of some new menu options. We'd made reservations for 5:30p, but due to needing not only a high chair, but also room for a stroller, we weren't seated for a few minutes. (Of course this place was packed on such a special occasion.) But the manager came by our table within the first few minutes and assured us that we would get our $1 tacos even though time was running out.   We ordered guac, which is made table side. You can make it as spicy (or not spicy) as you like. We went with no spice, but there was still plenty of flavor - definitely a lot of lime and garlic came through.   We each ordered five tacos as well as sides of beans and rice for the little ones. My favorite taco was definitely the short rib because the meat had so much flavor!  When dessert time rolled around, I was quite surprised that they let three of us claim our free Flan with Yelp check-in. Frankly, I ordered the Flan simply because it was free (I was far more interested in trying the Deep Fried Ice Cream and the Churros). However, the Flan ended up being my favorite of the three! (I guess I've only ever had mediocre Flan). This was a beautiful custard - not too gelatinous in texture (I hate that), but perfectly smooth and creamy. The flavor was sweet, but not over powering. This will definitely be my top pick for dessert when we come back!   But don't get me wrong, the other desserts were pretty awesome, too! The Ice Cream's Fried exterior had the perfect chew and crunch and was absolutely dripping in hot fudge! And the churros had a crunchy, sugar-coated outside and chewy inside.   The chef also sent out two VIP, off-the menu desserts for the little ones - it was a pumpkin cheesecake topped with whipped cream. Talk about about delicious!  I couldn't believe that in one evening we had the chef and the manager come by a couple times to make sure everything was to our satisfaction! And the Chef sent special desserts for the girls? And he gave us $5 off coupons to encourage us to come back and try breakfast?! AND they manager let us know that on Mondays locals get 25% off their entire bill?!? This place is an absolute steal. Especially considering the quality of the food and the artistry and flavor that comes out of the kitchen.   If you haven't been, go! And make sure to ask for Chris as your waiter. If he can handle our crazy party of seven, he can handle anything. And he does it all with a smile!",

Their menu is about 4 pages long that consists of tacos, burritos, fajitas and a few other things. We got the mild, medium and spicy guacamole. They do it right at your table which I always love. The spicy didn't have much spice IMO. I got a burrito w/ carne asada, shrimp and rice. It was great!  Everyone in our party was happy w/ their dinner. Drinks were on point.

    "text": "While I wouldn't say it's a common occurrence, there are times when my experience at a restaurant is just the complete opposite of Yelp consensus, but I'm not sure that's ever been the case to this degree. El Dorado Cantina comes in at a prestigious #28 in this year's Yelp Top 100, but my experience during a Saturday dinner was one that's routinely eclipsed by both contemporary and traditional Mexican restaurants across the country.    Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?  If you're not already aware, El Dorado Cantina shares a building with Sapphire, the world's largest strip club. That's not at all a strike against the restaurant, but it's just something to be aware of.   Once you're inside the atmosphere and service at El Dorado are both excellent, with attentive servers who bring the food out quickly. Star Granted.   Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  So it was here that things started to get a bit off. After downing some mediocre margaritas I reviewed the menu, and was a bit surprised to find that an order of three street tacos came to $12.00, or $4.00 each. That is, by any standard, expensive for street tacos, which even at sit down spots often run me no more than $2.50 or so in Dallas or Los Angeles or elsewhere in Las Vegas. I think I might better understand that price point if El Dorado were on the Strip, but they aren't, and at the end of the day these were still pretty basic and normally portioned street tacos. That's simply too expensive a price point. No Star Granted.    Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  I opted for three street tacos: one carnitas, one pastor, and one carne asada. All three were good, but none of the three were great. The meats were clearly of high quality and the peripheral onions and cilantro were well portioned, but the tortillas (flour) didn't taste as fresh as I've had elsewhere and there was a lack of salsa options to accompany the trio. Had these been cheaper or larger I think I'd have a different opinion here, but given that they were neither, I can only define these tacos as having been 'okay'. Single Star Granted.   Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  Maybe spending the past four years in Dallas has permanently skewed my view of how good tacos should taste and cost, but I'm honestly just confused as to why my dinner experience was in such contrast to Yelp's consensus. For now, there are better Mexican options in Vegas in my opinion. No Star Granted.",

Don't know if Chef Paco was not there the last two times or not?  The service was good the last two times, we walked in were seated right away and offered drinks.  On this very last visit when the chips and salsa were brought to the table the chips seemed hard and stale tasting which at first seemed odd as we've never had this before.    The rice, normally amazing buttery flavor with cilantro both this time and last week was really dry and not flavorful like it used to be.  Last week I had the steak fajitas which were seasoned really well, the rice was bland and not like usual.  Last night I got the ribeye deciding to try something new and it was cooked to perfection and tasted amazing, however the rice was again dry and bland, not like it used to be.  Also my daughter got the fajitas this time and the guacamole they brought with her dish looked old and dry.  My wife's dish which was the soup and a sandwich, also did not taste like it was seasoned the way it used to be.  I really like this place but my wife was not happy the last two visits which is really sad.  The staff is amazing, on top of everything, it just seems like the kitchen is not the same.  I hope we will be back but it's up to the boss, two bad visits for her normally does not go back for a third disappointment.",

No fear for the shy, El Dorado has their own door so you don't have to walk through a strip club to access the restaurant.  Our waitress was very attentive and was always around when we needed something. Our water glasses were refilled often and empty dishes were cleared quickly.  The salsas that comes with the chips to start were really good. That definitely set the tone for what was to come. Both the red and the green were fresh and flavorful. We also started with Beef Empanadas. They were good, but not out of this world flavorful.  The Chicken Enchiladas were really good. I loved the sauce on top of the enchiladas. The rice and beans on the side were nicely seasoned. The Mexican Corn had a nice flavor. My husband enjoyed his Short Rib tacos as well.   Dessert that evening was the Flan that is free with Yelp check-in. Flan is not my preferred dessert, but this was really good flan.   I'm glad that I didn't let the location keep me away because the food is great!",

Service was awful-one guest waited 20 min for a come and finally gave up and walked up to the bar himself to get a refill a HUGE no no in the industry! We waited way too long for our meals, one was a salad, street tacos, appetizer quesadilla which didn't taste like any \"steak\" I've ever eaten. Rhen the churros one person ordered weren't even hot. They were sent back and obviously just re microwaved be the whip cream was taken off. The inside was filled w/what looked like an orange filling which later they said was Carmel. Well he didn't eat it and therefore had nothing bc that was all he ordered. We came home and made dinner. They did the 18% and it was more then he deserved bc he disappeared for 90% of the meal but proceeded to hover around when it was Check time. Argh. None of us Not impressed overall. Not to mention the extremely weak mango margaritas small size for $14?! Yikes -nope not again.",

They took the time to get to know me and give me their personal recommendations. Thanks to Miranda, Amber, Daniel and Chef Paco we enjoyed the amazing chicken tinga, quesadilla, and the most surprising the GRASSHOPPERS! Everything was amazing and you could taste the time and effort put into each dish. I'm so glad we decided to try something new! We will be back for sure :):)",

The atmosphere is friendly and elegant, the service is outstanding, so are the variety of dishes prepared by Chef Paco, who gave us a fantastic service..He came out to chat, and made us feel part of the family. We ordered beef burritos and cocktails. The dish was delicious and came with three kinds of salsa including \"Rico\" Guacamole, and the best chili habanero I have tested in Las Vegas. We were there on a Thursday, and Latin music was playing in the background. We will soon be coming back to El Dorado Cantina. This place is Awasome!!",

There's a cute bar in the center, but didn't check it out since I was there for lunch.  The chicken empanadas were delicious as our appetizer. Their chips were really good and definitely homemade.  They have a trio of salsas and all 3 were delicious.  The peach colored is extra spicy,  so if you don't like really hot food stick with the other 2. I had cheese enchiladas as my main course - they were good. I didn't try the rice or beans because I was already full. Service could be a little better though, as we did have to wait a long time to get refills on tea and soda. Prices were in line with other restaurants nearby and the portions are big! I would recommend this to try if you love good Mexican food.  I also noticed a wide range of gluten free options.",

The guy works at encore, Wynn, and he decided to bring me to a restaurant off the strip rather than take me to a steak house at the Wynn...  This restaurant is actually pretty great overall, but common, a girl travels to Vegas just for you and instead of wining and dining her u bring her to a random Mexican restaurant off the strip in a dark street? Oh wait, did I mention there's a gentlemans club next door? Well there is, and between us, I rather be there. Brb my food just got here.  Ok so I just finished my meal, the margaritas aren't that good, but the food is honestly amazing. The best part of the meal was the cilantro rice, it was soft and had a sweet touch to it which made it really appetizing. The server was great, his name was Mark, very nice guy and would check on us very often to make sure we're happy with everything we ordered and he made sure that our experience went well. I ordered the steak burrito and it was pretty good, we also got shrimp tacos and they were amazing, the shrimp was grilled so it was a light meal. For dessert: I hope you like eggs bc the flan tastes like a day old omelet.  Adios!!!! ;)",

This restaurant's location is a little off putting but don't let that fool you, you are about to have great Mexican food.  First let me discuss its location, it is on Industrial Road about 3 minutes from Fashion Show Mall and shares a parking lot and building with the Sapphire's gentleman's club. (Please Note: This is not the same business, they only share the same building.)  Once inside the El Dorado Cantina, you will be impressed by the decor and friendly service.  I would to discuss the food; the server described the menu as all organic and GMO free.  We ordered appetizers, entrees and a selection of their happy hour street tacos. The food that arrived so far exceeded my expectations that I was compelled to write this review. Let's talk about the street taco sampler platter, six tacos for six dollars... This has to be the best value for happy hour in all of Las Vegas. The Chef, came to our table (Chef Paco) to ask on the quality of the dinner and insisted that we try the Spanish Flan with his complements. If you like don't like flan you will be surprised and if you like flan you will be amazed.",

The fact that it's organic and non-gmo is what makes this place a gem...we honestly wouldn't have gone if that wasn't the case. The location IS next to a gentlemens club with the same parking but it has its own entrance and it's honestly not that big of a deal. Our server was Amber and she rocked it! Gave us good recommendations that weren't your standard \"this is popular BS\" that a lot of servers do to push certain items. She checked on us often and made sure we had everything we needed. We ordered the Carne Asada Burrito and 3 Tacos ( Al Pastor, Chicken, and Cochinita). The burrito was absolutely phenomenal. The beef was so tender I though I was eating short ribs! The tacos were all really good too but Cochinita was the star! I also ordered the Strawberry Margarita was which so good and so much! It's practically a fish bowl drink and it's not full of unnatural simple syrup or triple sec. Everything but tequila is organic in that sucker and they're even working on getting organic tequila too. We then met Chef Paco when we got our Yelp Flan (which is no small portion) and he told us about his grandmas authentic recipes and the importance of organic ingredients. It's no wonder that the food, especially the meat, is so tasty! We will definitely be back every time we come to Vegas!!",

The chips & 3 salsas that are brought to the table are super yummy.  We also ordered the queso fundido with mushrooms which was tasty.  Then there was the street tacos.  I ordered the carnitas tacos which were delicious.  The rice that came along with them was good (typical mexican side of rice).  We ordered a dessert to share - the fried ice cream.  It was really good.  I've had better versions but it was tasty.  Especially the banana sauce on the side.  The service we had this night was great.  As for the 2nd time we went, we happened to show up during happy hour.  Surprisingly enough, it was not as busy as the 1st night we went BUT the service was so much slower & worse.  It took forever to get drinks, to order, to get refills, our food, etc.  That was the only reason for the 4 star review instead of a full 5.  I'm hoping the next time we go, the service will be as good as the food is!",

There was coconut milk in there for sure. It reminded me of a South East Asian dessert, which may be why I thought it an odd pairing with my main course. Oh and there were no vegetables with the meal, weird. Service was great; hence the 4 stars.",

Entrees of mahi tacos, shrimp tacos, and street tacos, carne asada and carnitas, were delicious and very filling.  We topped off our lunch with Chef Paco's grandmother's recipe of the most delicious flan I have ever tasted.  Definitely a new favorite for Mexican in Las Vegas.

I think he mentioned it was the chef's grandmother's recipe and it's wonderful, definitely make sure you save room for dessert.   I will say I was a bit disappointed with our waitress the last time we were there.  She seemed to be more interested in talking to her friends than serving us.  The manager checked on us though and refilled our drinks, etc.  But I love their food too much to take a star away for the service.  Hopefully that was a one-time thing.",

    "text": "I love non-gmo/organic food. I'll pay the extra cash when I'm at the grocery store, and I realize that non-gmo food is definitely NOT the norm when ordering from a restaurant. so this whole non-gmo- Mexican- restaurant idea was appealing to me.  I had no idea until we arrived that this place is  located directly next to a strip joint. but it was no problem. I didn't have trouble parking at all. I arrived on a Monday (Presidents day) around lunch.. I  decided to try this place, as it was on the 'Yelp's Top 100 Places to Eat in the US for 2016'   The food was just ehh OK. I buy corn tortillas that are non-gmo from whole foods, and even those are handmade with better quality/taste.  I ordered 3 tacos: 1 chicken, 1 carne asada, 1 cochinita, to get an taste of the array of meats/seasonings they offer. Also had carne asada burrito and albonidigas soup. None of these items were spectacular enough to return back here for. Maybe this place is more of a lounge than a restaurant, but it appeared quite the opposite.  It's nice that this place is open 24/7, but I'm sure there are more Mexican restaurants where I can get exactly what I ordered for better flavor under  $45 bucks... (That's how much our total was, not including tip) And unlike any other Mexican restaurant I've been to, chips and salsa refills aren't free.  I just don't understand the hype of this place. Using non-gmo and organic ingredients doesn't mean the flavor need be sacrificed.  If you end up at this place keep in mind it's 25% off for locals on Mondays and checking in on Yelp is necessary as the free flan was the only highlight of our visit. Usually flan I've tried from Mexican restaurants are a waste of calories, not the case here.",

Basically everything on the menu is great but some of the best are the fajitas, chorizo appetizer, the steak bowl (forgot the actual name), cheese enchiladas, corn, any burrito with the green sauce on top, and any of the tacos. If I had to pick just one, I'd suggest the steak bowl for a single person or the fajitas to share with someone else. Make sure to order the side of corn as well.",

Main issue was service tonight, busboys and water service was solid but strangely waiter was nowhere to be found most of the meal.  When we did see him he was checking in on other tables in the close to empty restaurant. Check in for drinks and to order and didn't come back until after we were done eating. Could have used some tapatio..... luckily bar tender / bar back helped us out in getting check etc. Food was ok and drinks ok, service was the weakest point.   Pros: average food Cons: service and paying a premium for average food off strip  Much better Mexican food to be had off strip in the Las Vegas area with better service.",

I have a lot of experience eating at Mexican restaurants, and I have to say that the food was overpriced for what it was (even by Las Vegas standards), and that it is much more of a Californian Mexican style than traditional Mexican.   We tried the table-side guacamole -- very fresh, but needed a lot more spice and salt. The complimentary salsa was similarly bland and lacking heat.   I have always wanted to try Mexican corn, so I was very excited when I saw this on the menu, but unfortunately I was not a fan. It was covered in chipotle spice, which is something that I very much dislike. But my father ate it instead, and he liked it.   Overall, the whole thing was good, but not great. My shrimp burrito was meh and flavorless...dad's street tacos were fine, but nothing amazing. We both liked our cocktails, though -- frozen strawberry margarita and jalapeno margarita.  I'm sure that there must be a better Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas than this one!",

As seen on the billboard they tout no-GMO ingredients, but it doen't mean anything unless it tastes good. Good news is - it does!  I'm impressed - now they are officially one of my favorite Mexican (though Americanized) restaurants in Vegas, on par with Imperial Tacos & Beer.",

    "text": "I was not really ready for this place to almost share an entrance with the \"World's Largest Sapphire Gentlemen's Club\" (wondering who keeps the list of the top ten) so I was just a little hesitant to enter in fear of what I might see or worse, what I might NOT see. I did find the place to be very good and the walls adorned with all kinds of \"Voted top 10\" in several poles including yes, even Yelp. Having read earlier in the day that the we're know for their fresh, wholy organic guacamole I just had to give it a try and WOW it exceeded my expectations. I actually ended up only having that and a Bourbon on the rocks for my dinner. I must say the entrance did add some intrigue and some pretty good \"people watching\" after I got over the shock of it all. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a prude, I just once again didn't expect tit, I mean IT...... Question; am I fixated on this item? One small suggestion to ownership. Get yourself or make yourself some heartier tortilla chips or make them yourself. You need some good supporting base for the great, table side, home made guacamole....trust me. At least make thick chips an option! It is a good place, one large room and you better like the color red!",

Warned me about the porn in the refrained beans, this was nice considering my wife is vegetarian.  The quantity is too much for any one person. The nacho can serve at least 6 people unless you want to consume 3500 canaries in one sitting. The mango salad with chicken is good for 3 people.  My request is to focus on the quality of the food, cut the quantity",

Open 24/7 HAPPY HOUR; EVERYDAY- (4pm - 6pm) & (12pm - 2am) ***Drinks 1/2 Off All Wells and Domestics ***Food $7 Food Menu, $3.50 Street Tacos MONDAY- (12pm - 12pm) ***Drinks 25% Off w/Local ID ***Food 25% Off w/Local ID  FOOD - Come hungry as the portion sizes are generous and can be shared! Meals range from $9 to $28. They also have vegetarian and gluten-free options available. I ordered one of the house favorites, Siegel Plate; it came with their award winning cilantro rice, free-range chicken and steak, crispy onions and grilled asparagus. Very flavorful!! We also order the table side guac which tends to always be a favorite of mine at restaurants. WHATS UNIQUE HERE? Chapulines (Sauteed grasshoppers). You can order them either w/ a garlic lime or habanero flavor. I have yet to try them, but if you are feeling a little daring these little critters are on the menu.  ATMOSPHERE - I was immediately impressed with the decor and ambiance! The deep red, rose-textured walls, w/ wrought-iron chandeliers and colorful decor really pulls you in. Decor seems to be inspired by the Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead).  SERVICE - Impeccable. Not only did Erica provide prompt and exception service. Both the manager and chef came around and introduced themselves. It really made the experience memorable!  And lastly, dont get distracted on the fact that Sapphire is right next door. El Dorado has its own ambiance and vibe that's independent of the gentlemen's club!   MUST TRY!! Why not stop by during happy hour, bring a few friends, order a few tacos or share the oh so delicious tableside guac!?",

    "text": "My husband and I went here last night to meet up with a group of friends. We went to the bar to wait for them, and spent about 10 minutes there without receiving a drink. The bartender was friendly enough, and someone brought us waters, but we were not asked for a drink order after that amount of time. By that time, our friends showed up and we went to their table. I don't know if the waiter was new or what, but the whole experience was horrible. It took me 45 minutes to get a margarita that I ordered as soon as I sat down. Chips and salsa took about 20 minutes to arrive. We had to ask again for both the margarita and the chips and salsa after initially ordering them. The server informed us that he could not begin to take food orders until everyone in the party arrived. Fair enough, but didn't really make sense since he had already taken drink orders. Plus at the end of the meal he asked everyone individually what they had ordered to split the checks, when he was so adamant in the first place about needing to write everything by seat number. I arrived starving and two hours later finally received chicken tacos that were so bland that I only ended up eating one. I would eat a chicken taco from Del Taco any day over these. Also under the street tacos section of the menu it states that they are $14.50 and gives several options....chicken, pork, carne asada... I asked the server how many tacos came in the order and he said 3. I asked if I could mix up the meats and he said that I could but that it would cost more. That makes no sense. If I ordered 3 carne asada tacos it would be $14.50. If I ordered 3 chicken tacos it would be $14.50. You get the point. But if I ordered 2 chicken tacos and one carne asada it would be more expensive? Ummm what? Anyway, two orders of tacos, 2 margaritas and one beer later, we received a bill for $100, with gratuity already added. I get it, I work in the industry, adding gratuity for a large party is a thing, but I can tell you that I would NEVER have tipped 20% for that service and food. It's safe to say I won't be returning. We had been there once before many years ago and sat at the bar, so we were excited to come back for Taco Tuesday, but what a huge disappointment! P.S. Our entire group works in the service industry....bartenders, servers and cocktail waitresses.",

My wife has the jalapeno margarita and it was made differently both times. Once it had spicy pepper on the rim and in it the other time it did not.  I had the skinny margarita made with Don Julio Blanco and it was super sour tasing.  The table side guacamole was a neat gimmick but it almost had too much citrus in it.  I had the mahi-mahi  tacos and it was good. It had a lot of flavor and was enjoyable but for 16 dollars for two tacos I would expect it to come with rice or beans. If I wanted rice or beans it would be 4 dollars more. My wife has the carne asada and that was delicious by far the best thing we had on the menu. The service was good nothing special but it wasn't poor either.",

Don't be discouraged as this place is within the same building as Sapphires Club (my favorite) yet separate completely.   Executive Chef came out and greeted us thanked us for coming and actually provided us with dessert (in all fairness one of the gentleman were with was a professional pastry chef and I think they overheard us speaking about why he was in town. Nevertheless, a True class act & gentleman for coming out and shaking every one of our hands. Any of the tacos were delicious but the guacamole was exceptional! A must have.   I would go back just for the professionalism. Nevertheless the food was very good and I'll be visiting that place again.   Oh yeah on Taco Tuesday, they have $5 1942 shots. WHAAAAAAT!!!  Thanks El Dorado Cantina Team. See you soon.",

Plus the burger didn't have very much flavor. Honestly it was saved by the fact that the bacon was very crispy or I'd probably give it a lower score. This was labeled as the Mayweather Mexican burger. Was too try to be a Mexican burger.   Sorry @eldoradovegas , not  a great experience. Though I did try the tacos al pastor as well and those were decent. But I've had much better in town for a better price point.   Thanks for the food. But Probably won't come back here again.

Couldn't decide between queso Mexicano tacos and the grilled mahi tacos. Went with the mahi and they were amazing. The fresh mango salsa and cilantro rice made the dish. I'll try the queso next time. Husband loved his carne  asada burrito.  Happily surprised when the bill came. The food was worth every penny. We will definitely be going back!",

It's NOT part of the establishment next door and well worth the trip. The authentic Mexican cuisine is 5 stars. The hospitality is 5 stars. We had a business event with about 100 people and I would recommend it to anyone. The loss of the star is ONLY due to the heckling I will need to endure from my colleagues for not knowing the adjacencies prior to arriving.",

I will go back as soon as I move into my new house this weekend. I'm not one to make a business lose revenue.    Original:  Took a friend from Switzerland for Mexican. This is the highest rated Mexican restaurant. Horrible location near a ton of adult clubs, gentleman bars for strippers. They share a parking lot with a nude \"adult\" club.  Please don't take kids around here.   Margaritas ordered were difficult to drink out of a straw because of the pulp.  Overcooked steak enchiladas, and I'm pretty sure they nuked it.  Why else was the red sauce dry as a bone on the enchiladas? Refried beans tasted tired. What's with white rice? It's Mexican food! Serve Spanish rice for God's sake! I have no idea if my friends chicken quesadilla was any good.  The best part of the restaurant were the tortilla chips and salsas. 1 star for tortilla chips.  Otherwise, it's quite American. I'm Mexican descent. Oh, and afterward my bank called to say someone skimmed my debit card.  Thanks, no thanks! No bueno!",

    "text": "This is my second visit since going two years ago. The one thing that stood out was the table side guacamole which I had back then and was excited to order again. We were a party of 4 that were seated behind the hostess door/entrance. Quite cold that evening but it wasn't an issue.   Let's get the location out of the way super quick...yes it's right next to the strip club. Done.  To make this review short and to the point, El Dorado is good Mexican food that's quite forgettable and won't have you craving another bite. The table side guacamole was made by our server quite perfectly. At $17 it is what it is. At least it was fresh and made with the requested spice level.  Our server seemed to make things awkward when ordering or requesting something. We asked for lemons twice and didn't receive anything on a slow night at the restaurant. I then proceeded to go to the bar and ask for lemon wedges that was taking forever. The server quickly ran to the bar to question what I was doing? I thought to myself, \"your job\". She didn't even offer to take them to my table to make up for it. The other guest at my table was very mad and brought it up and she said \"maybe I should share my tip with him.\" Awkward? Unnecessary?   I'm a server myself and it's stuff like this that would get us seriously in trouble at work. Anyways. Food order took forever. Still I believe we were very considerate and patient considering her slow pace. I ordered the Carne Asada entree which was good just a bit dry. My girlfriend ordered forgettable Mahi and Shrimp tacos (spicy). Two other guests ordered the chicken enchiladas which seemed good but that person was angry at the server. The other ordered tacos which were just ok.  Look, this is a Mexican restaurant next to a strip club joint. I get it's a casual fun environment but the wait time along for what we ended up paying should have resulted in better service and more exciting flavors.   I was pretty upset they refused to accept the Yelp Flan Free dessert for checking in, and even more surprised she didn't make an exception and just offer it to us because she made us get up and get lemon wedges at the bar.  I don't think I'll ever come here again. There's other Mexican restaurants who don't charge excessive amount of $$$. At that rate I was expecting a stripper to serve our shots of tequila, lol.  What should you do: SKIP IT!",

This past weekend, my friends and I went to this restaurant before seeing the puppetry of the p*nis show at a nearby venue. We ate, and decided to go back after the show and before going to the sapphire club BECAUSE the wait staff were so awesome.   We were eating and saw \"comedian\" Eddie griffin at the bar... he is the WORST, especially for a has- been. THATS a story for another day---  I'll likely blast him on FB if you need to read the full run down. However, the Executive Chef Paco was a total turd to us. He gave us attitude, invaded our space, and made us feel like we were not good enough to be there when he had a \"VIP\" customer at the bar.   It just goes to show that one bad apple can spoil the bunch... and unfortunately it's one of the highest leaders at this establishment. I would suggest this place as long as you can avoid the chef and his attitude. GET IT TOGETHER, dude!",

Service: 2 years ago it was kind of hit or miss, but the most recent visits into last year have been great.  Servers were consistent with getting the orders in and drinks fresh.  The times we ordered fresh guacamole at the table, it's always been made well with a smile.  They kept their bottomless Chips and Salsa promise at the table.  Mexican eats:  If you have time, get the table side guacamole that's made..wait for it.. table side. =)  Social media friendly but most importantly it's very good.  I've sampled burrito and taco dishes throughout my visits but my El Dorado #1 is definitely their \"Signature Bowl\" I rock it with: Carnitas, brown rice & black beans.  They add guac, queso fresco, pico de gallo and mexican 3 cheese blend.  It makes for a very good bowl.  Ambiance: Very classy high end decor that provides a great date vibe.  Intimate leather booths, dark wood, red walls and contemporary lighting make for a very chic dining experience.  The center bar has all the premium bottles and there's flat screens throughout the open dining area usually playing sport channels  El Dorado Cantina is open 24 hours and I've wandered in here really late/early morning and the food was still on point.  The interior is pretty and so is the food presentation and the portions are fine.  However, know that you are paying strip restaurant prices at El Dorado Cantina.  Vegas is officially a foodie city and there are many Mexican restaurants that can offer what El Dorado offers but significantly cheaper.  You won't get the ambiance or 24 hour convenience but that's what's out there.  If you know this, then that won't stop you from visiting El Dorado especially at 3 AM in the morning because you know the premium you're paying.  Enjoy...=)",

I love the look and feel of their interior. The chips/salsa weren't salty and the salsas were perfectly delicious. $3.50/refill. The amount of food for the Cactus tacos dish was filling. Best Cactus tacos I've ever had! The rice was amazing as it had butter/zest flavor. Beans were on point! Every bite of their corn was heaven. Our chips/salsa were taken away while we were talking, which I was sad about because there was still half left. The manager came to our table to check how things were and she was very kind and we will be back very soon. Loved this place!!! So good.",

We went with pretty large groups, between 6 and 10, and everyone enjoyed what they ate.

Upon walking in, it is full of red velour walls and booths. The restaurant is nice and clean and the staff were extremely nice! I got lettuce wrap tacos and for 2 tacos, it was $13.00. I think it was a little bit pricy but when you check in on Yelp, you get a free flan and that was amazing!!! The meat on my tacos were nice and tender- cooked perfectly!!   The flan was AMAZING!! One bite and you're hooked! It was nice, creamy and pretty dense but oh so heavenly!! My cousins and I all agreed that it was probably the best flan we have every tried.

Locals get 25% discount on Mondays. 6. The taco trio is a good place to start. I get the al pastor, carne asada, and carnitas. It comes with black beans and their signature rice, which is amazing! 7.

So, we were easily sold on the place by the very positive reviews from the local Yelp community.  There's really nothing new or different that I can add on top of the nearly 1000 reviews of this place.  Service was fast, friendly and attentive.  The first round-gratis chips tasted fresh made and were crispy without oiliness.  The salsas were flavorful, spicy, and were True standouts.  I applaud the fact that they had Chapulines and our server's recommendation to have the garlic and lime over the habanero was a good call.  They were delicious.  I love pozole.  El Dorado Cantina's pozole was the best rendition that I've yet encountered.  I'll leave it to the wife to recount her experience, but suffice it to say she left completely satisfied.  Prices were reasonable and portion sizes were a solid value in relation to its price.  El Dorado Cantina was the definition of a local gem.  It served up some of the best, authentic Mexican food that I've had in a long time.  For tourists, it's a worth a trip off of the Strip to eat here.  For locals, thanks for not keeping this place a secret.",

Ok, not really cool but whatever if they are busy.  Checked open table, reservations available every 15 minutes all night long.  Tables sat empty nearly the whole time we were there.  Save your fake hype and give us a table.  - 1 Star- Apparently there are Taco Tuesday specials?  Wouldn't know by anyone in the restaurant telling us, just happened to see it on the website.  Margaritas are $5.  Awesome!  Oh wait....they're actually $7 and haven't updated their website  -1 Star- service behind the bar is awful.  Waited without any drinks (finished my Margarita several minutes before and drained my water waiting for acknowledgement from the bartenders), waited for our check without anyone asking if we wanted more drinks or anything else, to the point that I had stacked all of our dishes on the edge of the bar hoping someone would notice and come offer us service, watched several other patrons waiting, and waiting...and waiting for service.   Sooo, TLDR version- this place is overrated, overhyped, over priced.  We won't be back ***FUN UPDATE: All three of us got sick from this meal.  So really no stars would be more accurate.",

    "text": "This place is located in a very strange location. Actually i thought jt was in a strip club. So i would Particularly say it was kid friendly. We were shuffled in and a party of 6 so we were placed at our table. I am local but my friends and i stopped on on the way to the airport before they left... on a slight time crunch but not to the point of missing flights etc. so, we sat for a long while before the waitress came Over. She was very impersonable but she was ok. The appetizers came out before the 3 margaritas we ordered. Which were delicious. The empenadas came w only 3 and we're a little bland but good. The food, took forever! It was Monday night and not Busy and it took about 45 minutes..... in the mean time i asked for more chips and was told that refills on chips cost money. I was extremely Surprised and  annoyed w that response so i opted out (what Mexican place doesn't give free chips and salsa refills)  At this point the time is pushin it. My sister is super frantic about missing her flight so she orders and uber. The food comes and half of our party has to basically inhale it before they need to leave. I ask the waitress to box my food and add a fried icecream to our check. I am a bartender... i know splitting checks is a pain in the ass but when asked U don't roll your eyes and make it obvious u are annoyed. Because i am in the industry i try to avoid Multiple checks but given the circumstances we had no time to split it up. She says she will get us a box and put a fried icecream in. We hand her our card and tell her we are walking our friends out to say bye. When we come back my table has been cleaned there's no box. And what appears to be icecream W no waters or anything else left. I take a bite of The most stale fried icecream ever. I tell her she took our leftovers and now she's really Annoyed w us and it's obvious. A busser walks over w waters for us and she tells him in Spanish not to give us water (i speak Spanish but look white). I take another bite of my icecream And there's a fly in it. At this point, I'm done. The manager comes w our food they took away. She can tell we're upset. I tell her about the fly. She removes the icecream from he check and swipes the card. The waitress never comes back. Needless to say, i won't be back....",

We didn't know what to expect, but we had great service and great drinks. Food was really good. Second time we stopped by a couple hours ago and by far exceeded expectations. It was so much. Better than the last time. I ordered what was basically ceviche lol. It was amazing !!! I've had so many and it makes the top of the list. We sat at the bar and were helped by Ben. He is such a great bartender and is very nice. He made great suggestions in regards to food. He made our experience fun as he conversed  with us throughout our meal while still working of course. Ivan also made our experience great. He definitely knows customer service. It felt so comfortable with both of them there. By far they are some of our favorite people. We love to go to a bar and feel welcome and at home. The food came out in a timely manner, and the flan is beyond delicious. By far one of the best! If I could have it everyday I would. We also ordered the sopes and they were the perfect size. I love the size. Every restaurant should do this lol. My friend tried the albondiga soup which was new. It was perfect for this breezy weather. Thank you Ben for the amazing customer service we sure will be back. Hidden gem for sure.",

They started us off with chips and salsa. The red salsa was so good. My boyfriend liked the green one. We got a round of drinks some micheladas and some mixed drinks. The micheladas really good. I had one with a corona and the other with a modelo, both equally as great. When we got our food my burrito came with a side of white cilantro rice which was especially tastey! The chicken burrito I got was the best. Shredded chicken, cheese, and black beans. It was a big burrito I only ate half. I ate the other half at night after being out all day and it was just as good as it was earlier.",

I was happily proved wrong!   The location isn't super ideal... Right next to a giant strip club in an unusual location, not too far from Circus Circus. Still... Make the drive, take the uber, do what you have to do to make to out here!  I ordered the cheese enchiladas and they were cooked to perfection. They don't skimp on the cheese one bit, it was loaded! It was really well-seasoned and the breading texture was just right.   Juan was our waiter and was really great. I never waited for a refill and he was super nice and courteous. The food was served relatively quickly (maybe 10 minutes after ordering).  Las Vegas food isn't as great as I thought it would be, but this place is truly a gem!",

    "text": "Let me first say I am a regular here and I have ordered food or dined in several times over two or more years. The service is mediocre, but the quality of the food is usually excellent and delicious. This review is specifically for the system of placing a TAKEOUT order (NOT a delivery service such as Postmates or UberEats).  El Dorado is open 24 hours, and to my knowledge should be able to take a to-go order by phone. I've noticed several times that no one picks up the phone during late night hours (after midnight). Very annoying. It's a real inconvenience when we've already decided we'd like to eat here and there are limited dining options at that time of night.  This most recent time, we called in around 9:30pm. The person on the phone asks me to please hold. So I waited, and waited, and waited,... more than 10 minutes, and no one came back. I hung up at that point and tried calling again, only to get a voicemail. I was driving and was almost at the restaurant at this point so I decided to simply walk in and place the order at the bar. Seeing how much of an inconvenience it was, I had asked to speak to a manager. The bartender just gave me a brief explanation like \"A lot of people just walked in\".... So what? I had to request to speak to a manager more than once before an attempt was made by the bartender. Very unprofessional. On top of that, it took 25 minutes to get my food. Not the best when I have a 5 month baby at home who just woke up and needs my attention. Owners: PLEASE figure out a better system for placing a Takeout order. There should be a way to do it online through the website, or through a mobile app such as BeyondMenu. Thank you for taking the time to consider the needs of your patrons.",

Would usually get the seafood enchiladas but wasn't so hungry and did not feel like spending 20.00 on lunch. So I opted for a quesadilla where it said 10.99 or in that range and next to it add shrimp 14.99. Not so bad. When I got the bill for 25.00 I was sure a mistake was made. Apparently the shrimp add on is 14.99! I could have got my preferred meal for less. This was deceitful through way it was written. Use caution when ordering. The pricing is not clear and I feel like this was done everything purposely. Check out the menu, you'll see what I mean. Beware.",

    "text": "Short Review : GO! You won't be sorry. It's fabulous. Directly next to Sapphire strip club, so you have to actually park in their lot and walk towards that door, and then you will see the door for El Dorado to the left. It was slightly confusing for us at first, but we are so glad we went, and you will be too!  Long Review:   We ended up here because of the good yelp reviews. Had a little trouble finding it, but I'm so glad we did. Very cozy inside, kind of dark, nice big booths, great atmosphere.   Started with a Jalapeno Margarita, which was to die for if you like spicy. It was HOT, and also huge, so totally worth the $13 price tag, imo. I also loved the green salsa that came with the chips and trio of salsas...that was super yummy and my favorite of the three for sure.   Hubby had beef enchiladas, which he devoured. He did say they were slightly sweet, which was different for him, but he still really liked them. He also loved the rice, which also came with my order and was DELICIOUS! I've never tasted anything like it! SOoooooo good!  I had the veggie burrito, which was just fantastic. Veggies cooked to perfection and all the flavors blended together so well. The best veggie burrito I have ever had for sure. And again, the RICE, oh my goodness, so good!  The service was very good, and, what I am assuming were, two managers came to check on us and were constantly walking around checking on people. Also, I overheard one of them being questioned about combining items on the menu and she broke down the a la carte prices and said we can put it together however you would prefer to make you happy. I thought that was great. We were also next to a table of 8, and the waiter asked how they would like to break up the check and they wanted 4 checks (2 people each) and he was very nice and accommodating about that, which again, I thought was great service.   I ended up checking in on yelp (first time!) because there was a free flan offer even though we are not big fans of flan and were already pretty full, but I am so glad I did because it was awesome!! So delicious, and I found some room for it after all ;-)  A very well deserved 5 star review. Great prices, great service, fantastic food! I can't wait to go back!",

Everything I've had on their menu tastes authentic, fresh, and full of flavor. My favorite is the yemedijian plate, it's the best lettuce wrap taco you'll ever have. This is the best spot for a margarita too, I've come here just for margaritas and guac and left so satisfied. Definitely recommend the guac, margaritas, red sangria, and yemedijian as top must-trys at this restaurant.   Also have a really good locals and industry special on Mondays and Tuesdays. Not sure which day is which but we qualify for both so it's awesome.",

I ordered the chicken Feinstein and I'm sure it would taste a lot better if it was a bit hotter, temperature wise. I'm so disappointed that both reviews I've given this place are bad.

    "text": "This is an amazing find on the Vegas food scene. Fresh ingredients, skillfully prepared with TLC in a beautifully decorated locale. The price point is excellent for organic, gmo-free ingredients and the flavor palettes are so much deeper and nuanced than you find at most mexican influenced restaurants in the United States.  The creamy tomatillo sauce on the seafood enchiladas was brightly flavored, rich and balanced without any hint of heaviness from the cream. Chef Paco was happy to accommodate a substitution of corn tortillas for wheat in order to keep this celiac's stomach happy and even comped us an incredible strawberries and cream dessert when they ran out of flan. He's a sweetheart of a guy who happily chats with customers when there's a lull in the action.   The second visit (the very next night) to sample the 24/7 breakfast menu was no disappointment and we were well taken care of by Rafael, who demonstrated genuine concern for my gluten issues and was an all around delight. I hate to say they were better than the version I had in rural Morelos Mexico...  But frankly, the traditional huevos divorciados were elevated to new heights. It's amazing how the chef takes a common dish and turns it into something of memorable execution and presentation.  We're headed back over for round three before reluctantly returning to Denver in the morning. I'm not a gambler, but I'll be back to Vegas sooner than later just to get another taste of Eldorado's top notch cuisine... Because the quality here is NO gamble!",

    "text": "*THIS IS A GLUTEN-FREE REVIEW!*  As with all my reviews, this review is based on the fact that I have celiac, and I love to eat food.  Right off the bat, I could eat the tortilla chips, which I can only ever do at half the Mexican restaurants out there, so that was a good sign - I was immediately stoked!  I can only assume this place lists gluten-free next to many items because they are, in fact, gluten free!  Our server was confident in answering my questions about ensuring gluten-freeness and that everything was safe for someone with celiac, not to mention she was totally fun and friendly.    I ordered the pulled chicken street tacos with rice and beans and it was excellent.  The chicken was super shredded and juicy and tender.  Delicious!  Also, the rice was really good - it wasn't the normal orangey \"Spanish\" style rice you get at most places.  I really liked it.  Everyone at our table thoroughly enjoyed their food and I gotta say, the restaurant has a pretty nice atmosphere too.  Who cares that it shares a wall with a strip club?!  I'm from San Diego, where I believe all the best Mexican food lives, and I think this place was on par with some of my favorite spots down there.  Definitely going back to El Dorado next time I'm in Vegas - can't wait to try their empanadas or sopes!",

Her name is Tara, she's knowledgeable, funny, makes incredible margaritas (she's the master!) and made our night. I got the seasonal raspberry Cadillac margarita and my husband got the classic Cadillac margarita. The food is some of the absolute best I've had in town.  I got an al pastor taco, cochinita, and asada taco.  They were all delicious but if i had to pick a favorite it would be the al pastor.  The tacos were flavorful and not greasy. My hubby got the carne asada burrito xmas style with half green half red sauce.  Of course I had to try it, and it was awesome! For dessert we got the nieve de naranja and it was like eating an orange creamsicle. Everything is made with fresh ingredients and you can really tell.  I definitely recommend this place and i will be back.",

I believe they offer 20 percent off to locals now, although... No one has ever offered it or advertised it to us in recent months...  I love that they offer organic, non gmo food and have an array of vegan options:) however, their price point is kind of ridiculous for the location and the atmosphere. $16 for guacamole? I'm not trying to be a jerk, but where are they getting their avocados? The mark up is ridiculous. I paid $19 for two vegan lettuce wraps with black beans and rice. If you go with a friend, only one of you should order the beans and rice. They upcharge and there is enough for two.   The drink prices are reasonable, and they offer a wide variety of different tequilas. Their service is okay... not overly friendly... not overly quick... however, they are efficient and that's good enough. I really use to like to this place, but I've had better Mexican food at lower price points. The biggest plus... they are open 24/7 and offer healthier options than bar food.

I'm not sure what they put in their rice, but I'm still thinking about how delicious it was. The street tacos were also delightful. The drinks were also really good.  I spoke to Martine to plan my party and she was so accommodating. Everyone in our group loved the restaurant. The decor is beautiful. I'm really glad I chose to have my party there and I would gladly do it again.",

    "text": "Back in town, which means carving out time to go to my favourite Mexican place - El Dorado!  As always, the food was fresh, delicious, and authentic. The margaritas were ON POINT, as usual.   There are vegetarian and gluten free choices as well as the usual omnivorous options.   I had the corn street tacos, my friend had the beef enchiladas. We also ordered the table side guacamole and put the spice level to a 7 - it was amazing - had a solid kick but wasn't overpowering or too hot & I found myself having to refrain from licking the bowl    We had the churros & the house made orange gelato for desert - the latter is new since my last visit & it was a refreshing palate cleanser.  It's also free if you check in and review the business on Yelp (as of 9/2018; subject to change without notice.)   I love this place; the food and drinks are excellent, the pricing is what you'd expect for a 24/7 restaurant in Las Vegas - did I mention the food and drinks are excellent? - on the way out after finishing & I'm catching a cab back to the hotel, the cabbie mentioned - without prompting - \"that's the best Mexican place in the city.\"   You know you've got something when a local cabbie tells you it's the best without prompting!  Love this place, hope it's very successful & I can continue to visit every time I'm town.   TL;DR - Consistently excellent & interesting food & margaritas at reasonable-for-what-you-get pricing. It's off The Strip but absolutely worth the cab ride over.",

Bartender took our order but with a big attitude.  We got called to our table before we even got our drinks. We received our drinks 30 minutes later.

On a repeat visit during EDC 2016, I ordered the same meal and had the same religious experience. The food is organic and the rice is buttery ... And I don't even like cilantro.   This place is located (suspiciously) next to the Sapphire Gentleman's club. Do not let this deter you. You will be making a HUGE mistake. Enter and enjoy.

    "text": "Don't believe the hype.   On a cool Saturday night in Las Vegas I finally decided to check out the very popular El Dorado Cantina. I was not prepared for what was going to happen this night and I will give you nothing but my honest opinion here. I enter the restaurant and I request one seat for myself. The hostess said the bar is the only available seating for me despite the place being half empty. I do not like to eat at the bar since the space to place your food is limited. But I said ok might as well sit there since this place looks cool with its red walls and star lamps up above the bar seats.  The Pina Colada that never came.   I did not know who would take my order...the bartender or a waiter ? Niether seem to notice I was holding a food menu to my face for over 10 minutes. Finally I waived at the bartender and asked who was going to take my order and said he would. I ordered Red Chilaquiles that the menu said it had tomatillo red sauce (remember that) and carne asada and some chicken empanadas. I clearly said I wanted a pina colada and the bartender said ok and never saw the drink and he just gaved me another round of water...I was not happy with this and continued to eat my chips and salsa which were OK. Sadly my pina colada never came  Red Salsa Deception   I changed my mind on the pina colada and before the food came I decided to order a Cadillac Margarita which the bartender finallly ended up doing for me and it was tasty but lacked some punch. My food arrives and to my shock I noticed the 3 empanadas were all bite size...for $9.00...really??? I ate one and mostly tasted maza not chicken. At least the chilaquiles were looking good by I was in for an unpleasent surprise. I tasted the chilaquiles and something was not right, the sauce was not tomatillo red sauce, it was ENCHILADA SAUCE! I know the difference between red tomatillo sauce and enchilada sauce, and this was not what I expected. The egg, the cheese, the sour cream could not save my chilaquiles. The one star is for the carne asada slices which did have good taste.  The Pina Colada that never came Part 2  So I leave half my food on the dish and ordered a Pina Colada AGAIN which at this point I was craving for. I ordered one and bartender asked me what kind of beer I wanted and I responded with a \"What?\" Since when does a pina colada come with beer I asked. He looked at me confused and I said a corona I guess. The drink I ended up getting was a MICHELADA...how?...why? I waived to the bartender and said this is not a pina colada and he said I thought you said to me a michelada. He ran to get it made and I said forget about it give me the check I am out of here.   In Conclusion  After this experience what can I say? The rave reviews of this place were high and the expectations were higher...all gone to waste in one night. If you want to be the best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas than act like it. I was truly frustrated with my experience here. That is my honest opinion.",

The table side guacamole was expertly prepared by our server, Andrew.   We split the chicken Feinstein and it, too, was delicious. Highly recommend.   The food advertises itself as non GMO and organic. I like that and it will definitely be a reason why I return. The staff, from the hostess who took our reservation to our server and busters, was fantastic. Courteous and polite, quick and our cups were never empty long.

Upon entering the restaurant, I was not a fan of their decor. I thought it was tacky. Anyway, the hostess did not hesitate to seat us. We ordered al pastor, pork carnitas and carne asada. They gave us complimentary chips and three types of salsa. The chips were crunchy (yay for free NOT stale chips!!!) and the salsas were pretty good. I liked what seemed to be a roasted tomato salsa.   Our orders came quickly! We wanted to share our tacos and asked for plates. To our surprise, the plates were dirty :( anyway, our tacos came out good. It is one of the places here in Vegas that has the closest versions of tacos in border cities. I really like how all of the meats were so tender and seasoned well. Their prices for street tacos were a bit on the pricey side, as compared to others.   Still, El Dorado Cantina lived up to my expectations!",

After all of the positive reviews on Yelp, I decided to give it a try.  I am a big fan of organic/non-gmo food and try and eat this whenever possible so I was really excited to see this new option in town.  Took my parents and met a couple good friends here for dinner.  I was hoping that it wouldn't disappoint as I was the one who recommended the spot.  It did not disappoint!  Food was outstanding and service was spot on!  Kai did an outstanding job serving our table and had a great attitude as well!  Chef Paco was awesome with everything.  It was all really delicious with a great presentation as well.  In fact, 3 in the party commented that their tacos were the best they ever had!  High marks for this place, and I hope to see it succeed as we need to let our wallets speak.  It is time to start supporting people who serve real food, and not food that is chemical-laden and full of GMO's!",

    "text": "So many reviews here, that I'll keep it brief but in fact affirm the positive stars. Place has a nice ambience, while having several tvs (if u r a sports/news fan,etc) Lots of attentive staff & really comfortable seating. They bring you tasty tortilla chips on the house, along with 3 salsas. My one peice of advice for people sensitive to spicy -Word Of CAUTION on the salsa brought with the chips. .the Orange salsa is on fire, I'm talking a spice level of 8/9. It is deceiving as their are really no visible spices in this one.  I didn't realize this ,it took my breath away literally & a whole glass of water to get it back. The steak quesadillas & chicken tacos were very tasty. I'm confident that all of their dishes are top quality, for sure what you want when you are going for Mexican food;p also gluten free &organic, without losing flavor. This is a new hidden gem which I hope is here to stay. Open 24 hours ,full menu& bar . This place also has a specific breakfast am menu as well.",

    "text": "Found El Dorado Cantina on Yelp! As it is ranked the #1 Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas. Since we are transplanted Texans, we're Lways on the lookout for good Mexican food wherever we go. So we went. #1. It's in a really sketchy part of town; it's actually attached to the Sapphire strip club although you can't see or hear any of the noise from the strip,club inside the restaurant. So the decor is \"used to be a strip club\" garish...but interesting at the same time. FYI: if you go, tell your cab driver to GPS the name of the restaurant, not the address, our cab driver couldn't find it with the address so we had to type in the name of the restaurant. Anyway. The food is good. Very much legit Mexican food, although it wasn't \"Tex-Mex\" to me (so I take exception with the reviewer that says this place can stand with any Mexican place in Texas) but it was good. I had the carnitas street tacos and my wife had steak nachos. Very good; fresh jalapenos so a little extra zing. That's a good thing, because the salsa was just so-so. Chips were good. Service was excellent. Crowd was eclectic. All in all a good meal. Detractors are its a hassle to get to and the salsa wasn't all that.",

Sides very disappointing flour tortillas were generic store bought quality. Cilantro rice lacked flavor. Beans were okay. Guacamole/pico de gallo/sour cream portion was small to say the least enough for maybe 2 small tacos and were swimming in the liquid from the pico that made the guacamole and sour cream mostly liquid and useless. These fajitas would cost $10 less for better quality at many other restaurants.",

The restaurant is tucked into the corner nearest the street.  A little hard to spot but once you know where to look it is fine. 5 of my female friends and I met there for early dinner, all of us over 50 years old.  Didn't feel uncomfortable and parking was plentiful and good lighting.  They even have valet parking.  Now for the review of the food. We went because they are GMO free and have organic meats.  I have a few food restrictions (low carb) and they were more than accommodating of substitutions.  Their, at the table, guacamole was amazing, you can add ingredients as they make it.  Service was VERY attentive.  The manager, I believe her name is Martine,a very lovely woman came to our table and made sure everything was up to standards. She even had the hostess come over and take numerous pictures of us as we celebrated with our camera.  Our whole group was thoroughly impressed with the food and atmosphere.  Prices were comparable to other areas in town to eat. I checked out their menu on line before we went.  I believe they even have certain days of the week for discounts, Mondays are for locals, and Tuesday (the night we went) was street taco night.  Chef Paco, makes excellent food and I wish I had thought to compliment him when I was there.",

The decor is very rustic/sexy/sheik. Mexico meets Vegas! Great place to unwind, grab some amazing food and try a few tequilas (they have 100 choices). I came from Texas where you have authentic Mexican food served everywhere but here in Vegas, there was nada till now. It started with the chips and salsa. I know that's small stuff but you can see and taste the attention to detail right from the start. Beware of the red salsa, I'm just saying. They also serve fresh made juices! Such a unique and wonderful addition to an already amazing menu. Taquitos, queso fundido and shrimp tacos are the tasty dishes I tried. If I wasn't as full as I was I wouldn't have stopped there. How could I forget table side guacamole! I'm dying to go back and try this shrimp with cilantro cream sauce dish that made my mouth water. They use all non-GMO products and hormone free meat which I so appreciate since my new obsession with food documentaries on netflix. Their menu is delightful for offering such healthy options. I'm so impressed by this place that I am already anticipating my next visit. Please go try El Dorado Cantina Yelpers, it's a foodie's paradise!",

    "text": "Being that I'm Mexican, I am very fortunate to have a good amount home cooked cuisine so I rarely go out for Mexican food unless it's street tacos (El Buen Pastor!) but this place is phenomenal. From the moment you walk in it feels very welcoming w/a good vibe.  The place is plush and very spacious. Besides the cool decor, people really come here because the food is always on point. Eldorado advertises that they use organic/gmo free products and you can taste that quality in their food.  Little more pricier than say Lindo but its worth it if you want to try something different. The mole and Guacamole are must tries.",

    "text": "Went in to have dinner last week and the service was great. We were seated right away and the staff was very friendly. The reason for the three stars is because of the food. It tasted okay but I really don't believe the food is \"100% organic\" as our server claimed and for me that's a big deal. Being that we feed our kids organic meats only we know not only the taste of the different meats but we know the cost that comes along with it.   The nachos were delicious but the chicken tasted more like turkey. The carnitas were very tasty but there's something about them that makes me skeptical that they truly are 100% grass fed. Maybe it's because I know the challenge of finding truly organic pork and the fact that they served a huge pile of it raises red flags for me. The eggs didn't have the fresh taste like the ones we purchase from our local farmers markets and why would a place that claims to be organic not offer more organic beverage choices i.e. Stuff made out of fresh fruits in house?   Again, the service was wonderful and the experience of dining here was not too bad. If you're not concerned with eating organic this place is not bad at all. If you are seriously concerned about eating organic I'd stay home.",

An awesome, old-school Vegas atmosphere (next door to a strip club), professional staff that is very well-trained and great food.  Authentic, fresh, Mexican fare with a lot of unique choices.  I had the Siegel plate, which includes steak, chicken, asparagus and grilled onions.  It is a lot of meat, not a lot of filler.  The seasonings are outstanding and I could cut the steak and chicken with a  fork.  Wow.  Margaritas were plentiful and tasty (fresh lime juice - no mix).  The crowd consisted of both locals and travelers.  It is more of an adult place, of course, but there were plenty of women.  And no, there are NOT strippers in the restaurant.  I am a local and I will be back at Eldorado Cantina again and again.  Best of all, open 24 hours!",

    "text": "Everyone and their mother told me that I had to try this spot out. Located next to Sapphire strip club, this Mexican food place is open 24 hours a day to probably accommodate the strip club crowd. I enjoyed the interior of the place. However, the prices are a bit steep. I understand they use organic non-GMO ingredients, but geez those price hikes are unreal. Anyways, we ended up getting tacos. I got the al pastor and carnitas and I wasn't that impressed. Coming from California, we know good tacos and I can definitely say those tacos shouldn't be worth 13 bucks. They were terrible, but they weren't great either. However, the one redeeming factor were the free flans that we got through our Yelp check-in. Everyone agreed that the flan was some of the best flan we ever had. Overall, unless you're looking for an epic flan then I would suggest going to Tacos El Gordo for some delicious tacos that won't burn a whole in your wallet.",

We had a larger party so staff set up a foldable plastic table that came from the night club from next door. You might ask how did we know it came from next door? There was black sharpie on the table said \"sapphire.\" My first thoughts were I hope this table is sanitary. Staff then placed it next to the corner table and had us use the waiting bench as our table chairs. This would have been fine except for the fact other customers would sit right next to us while they waited for their table, \"very awkward situation.\"  We came on a tuesday so they had a special on the street tacos  ($3.50 each) and I believe ($6 each) for signature tacos. I ordered an al pastor taco and carne asada taco. Tacos were fairly small but tasty.   Al Pastor (4 stars)  I thought this taco was above average but not as good as taco y taco or tacos el gordo's al pastor. Taco was fairly small. There was plenty of pineapple on the taco which definitely added to the flavor. Out of the two tacos I liked this one the best.   Carne Asada (3.5 stars)  beef was slightly dry. Fairly well seasoned and quite a bit of meat on the taco. It came with limes which I used to help moisten up the meat. All in all decent taco, but would not pay full price for this taco.",

    "text": "So we went on a Monday when they had the 50% off locals deal.  Note it is 25% off now for locals.   Due to location and distance the discount definitely was enticing.  We started off with a pitcher of Margaritas.  It was a good size pitcher and they were decently strong .  The good thing was the non drinking wife is my built in designated driver.       For appetizers we had the Empanadas, Shrimp Cocktail and Shrimp Taquitos.  They were all very good.  The empanadas were as good as my former neighbor made for me every Christmas.  They use good shrimp which are fresh tasting and don't have the weird aftertaste you get from frozen shrimp sometimes.  That made they cocktail and taquitos really good.  We got a bowl of the Albondigas which was ok but not the best I have ever had.     We had shrimp tacos, Cilantro Garlic Shrimp and Carne Asada Plate for dinner - note there was 3 of us.  I am not that big of an eater.  The Shrimp Tacos and Garlic Shrimp was very good and really hit the spot.  The Carne Asada reminded me of a place in Rosarita I just loved.  The meat was well seasoned and so tender.      We finished off this mini foodie fest with the Tres Leches Cake and Leche Flan.  They were both amazing desserts.   A perfect ending to a very good meal.  Our server was Amber and she was incredible.  Despite the place being packed and Amber having several tables she made sure we were well taken care of.      They can get busy on Monday's so I made reservations of which I highly recommend.  They were turning people away the night we were there.  it is an odd location as they are not too far from the strip and also next to a Strip Club they share a parking lot with.  With the discount they were very reasonable.  Without the discount too expensive as they are no better than the nice Mexican places not near the strip.",

You choose any three out of 6 different tacos and served with rice and beans. Friend ordered the chicken enchiladas and her husband ordered the carne asade bowl. The green sauce on the enchiladas was good but spicy! The bowl was huge and tasty. Also order the grilled corn as it is the bomb! The corn is sweet and juicy and the coating is salty and slightly cheesy. Ended the meal with the flan. All four of us shared one as we were all stuffed but had to try it. It's creamy, and rich  and worth every calorie.",

Best street taco's I have ever had. Really good Tequila selection and prices that are really good. On industrial road not far from Treasure Island. Veggie dishes, awesome pork, beef and chicken, AND do yourself a favor and get the Flan. Chef Paco's grandmothers recipe. I love good tequila and good carnitas and carne asada tacos. You won't be disappointed. Enrique was our gracious server and Chef Paco came out to welcome us. Go there.",

The food was really good, but the service was marginal.  Four of our dishes came out at the same time, but two came out substantially later.  The staff would come around to check on the service, but it was like they weren't placing the same level of attention on the actual processes of doing their jobs efficiently.  For example, the server came to check on our desserts, but they were never actually delivered to us yet.... Maybe just an off night experience.  I will have to go back to see.....",

Sat for 5 minutes while the bartender who seemed to be pissed off about something did not say hi or acknowledge us.   So off to Bonito Michocan we go.

Cute decor and good sized venue. 24 hours is definitely a bonus, although not I'd ever go there at 3am, but good to know if I ever want to, it will be open.    Service was friendly. I did remind the hostess to check me in for my opentable reservation but she didn't. My server was spot on and nice. She makes really good table side guacamole but you also see her running around behind the bar and clean up things everywhere. Short staffed perhaps. The exec chef, Paco, came to our table and delivered the complimentary flan (free with Yelp check in) and was very friendly and passing out breakfast coupons and introducing himself.   Food is good, especially knowing it's all pretty healthy and all non GMO products. I'd say the taste is pretty average, not spectacular, especially with all the hype about this place. My fish and shrimp tacos tasted healthy but both proteins were over cooked. Fish wasn't juicy and shrimp was a bit rubbery. The rice is special, not your typical orange loose rice like other Mexican joints.   We went on a Monday so was able to partake the 25% locals discount.   Although with non GMO products, i do feel like it's quite overpriced considering what you get (rice and beans are all extra charges). The locals discount make it more reasonable and I'd probably never go there on other days.  Too $$ of a casual Mexican place for me.",

The chips and salsa were delicious! We absolutely Loved the green salsa. It was fantastic. The first order of chips and salsa is free. (You pay for the following orders of chips and salsa)  We had delicious happy hour margaritas. Our bar tender was a hoot. He was so much fun, and made our experience that much better. My friends ordered food off the happy hour menu and LOVED everything that came out. (I don't eat meat so I can't attest to how delicious it was- but it looked and smelt fabulous!) I ordered the veggie burrito! It was HUGE and AMAZING. Seriously guys. This burrito was Devine. Loaded with fresh veggies and omg THE CILANTRO RICE it comes with was the cherry on top. It was all so good! Already planning our next happy hour to come back! Yum!",

We checked in with yelp and got a free flan dessert.  all in all it was a great choice for our last night in Vegas!",

It's not that kind of place.  Chef Paco and his kitchen staff keep the flavors jumping with fresh ingredients and delicious takes on traditional fare.  Organically sourced vegetables.  Free range meat.  A genuine love for the gastronomic traditions of Mexico.  Put it together with an attentive staff like Danny (our server) and Andrea (the manager) and you've got something to get off the Strip for.    I've been coming to El Dorado for years and realized that I never really wrote a review for Yelp.  I just took it for granted that it would always be around, serving killer margaritas and delicious food.  In my opinion, it's the best mole in town (they serve a three mole sampler plate bigger than your head) and every month there are different dishes highlighting various regions of Mexico.  Oh yeah and save room for the flan.  Sweet, dense, with caramel-ly goodness, it's worth unbuttoning your jeans.",

Anyway, I like the way the menu is coded for gluten free and vegetarian options. Organic food with primary sourcing indicated. Most importantly, the food was yummy. I especially loved the shrimp tacos and also enjoyed the carnitas and tender asada. My dining companion was impressed by the beef empanadas and beef enchilada. Large portions and well balanced flavors. Super good fresh tasting guacamole. Even the opening chips and dipping sauces were a cut above. Our server Grace was helpful, efficient, and got 100% of my special requests perfect. I liked that the manager Ken walked through just to check in with each table as well. Nice decor and probably also a great place to get your drink on. High speed high quality free wi-fi too.",

The location is next to a strip club, which is a huge deterrent for me - I wouldn't bring my kid here or come back probably for that reason alone.   The service was extremely slow and there was not that many people to serve around us.  The prices were pretty steep for the food we got. I had their tacos (a la carte) and a salad and my husband had a burrito and one margarita shared with our group. Our bill alone was almost $50 and totally not worth that price.   I've had better food from local restaurants and food trucks that are still 'gluten free' using corn tortillas, for 1/3 the price.",

Their house red sangria is tasty, and the margs are strong.  But I was unexpectedly underwhelmed by the actual food. So much so that I don't clearly remember what I ate. I recall a great tableside guac. The taquitos were fine, nothing to write home about. The burrito I tried (pulled chicken, maybe?) was bland and dry. The tres leches cake was awesome, and I'm not usually a fan in the first place. I know I tried several other items, but I can't remember them.  Pricing is a bit high for Mexican food and for the location, but obviously the organic, non-GMO, etc ingredients cost a premium. Given all the amazing five-star reviews, I have to wonder if I came on an off night or just ordered the wrong items? Will likely end up returning to try the chile relleno and a seafood or salad dish.",

It's wholesome and responsible-- an interesting contast to the strip club glitter next door. Anyway, I ordered the seafood enchilada but seriously it was good,  probably. I know ate it all. I am stuffed. Let me tell you about Juan, our excellent waiter. He was excellent, if you could not tell by the previous sentence. He was attentive and just a lovely soul. (And that's not the margaritas talking because I thought that before my many drinks arrived). I will definitely be back. I want to eat the street tacos. It's what I originally came here for (and margaritas) but got side-tracked by the seafood enchiladas. The interior is beautiful with red silk walls, half round booths, great music and sexy lighting. I'm feeling pretty good about the experience! Also, a wee bit drunk.",

Their chilaquiles, and breakfest burritos are awesome as well and made correctly! Their elote is also super amazing and so fresh that it comes on the husk! What's cool is that your first basket of chips and salsa is complementary and a refill is so inexpensive.  Great food and great prices.  Their margarita and beer selection here is to die for.

I ordered the lettuce wraps with steak and my friend ordered the fried ice cream. The lettuce wraps were delicious, however, I received chicken instead of steak. I didn't even bother sending them back because I secretly wished I had ordered chicken; it's like they could feel my desire to change the order hence the wraps coming out like they did. I got the cilantro rice and black beans which were also very tasty. I asked for their hottest salsa and they brought me out what they said was habanero but tasted like tomato. Kind of a bummer, but the salsas that came with the chips & salsa had a good flavor, though not spicy.   My friend said the fried ice cream was fantastic, and I took his word for it as it was drenched in chocolate and it is not my flavor of choice.   The restaurant looks neat. Red, golds, and blacks dress the walls beautifully and it's dark, which I really like. The staff is attentive and friendly. I will be back to try the pozole!   Oh yes, and they use organic foods!  So if you're a health-nut this place should be on your list.",

Ordered some nachos and tableside guacamole to start as well as chapulines ( for the uninitiated these are crickets and they are delicious)  everything. Came out fairly quickly and all was really good. Entrees were Chipotle chicken, garlic shrimp, cochinita pibil.  This was all so good served with fresh handmade corn tortillas.

I highly recommend starting with the table side guacamole you get \"ALOT\" The chicken enchiladas \"SUPERB\" and the street tacos, \"TRY ALL OF THEM\". Also try the Homemade FLAN so rich and creamy.

    "text": "The food is good, the service was also good. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because of the fact that I ordered Nachos, which come with chicken or steak. And for an additional fee you can add shrimp. The menu is not formatted correctly to clearly state what the price for the shrimp add on is. The menu says Nachos 12.50 substitute shrimp 14.00. The way I interpreted the menu was that is you ass shrimp it's an extra 1.50 charge (keep in mind meat already comes with the nachos) any way to make a long story short I was charged 26.50 for nachos that had 4 shrimp on it! So beware when ordering that if you order shrimp on anything  they will add 14.00 on top of the menu price of the meal.",

Didn't care as much for the chicken enchilada but my companion enjoyed it.   Also ordered tableside guac - should have asked for more heat. They were happy to provide additional jalapenos upon request.   Speaking of jalapeno, the jalapeno margarita was fantastic. Also enjoyed the organic beers (ipa, Amber, blonde), with preference for Amber.   Next trip I'll likely order the carnitas plate.  Def planning to check out breakfast options!",

The food is so fresh and flavorful, and the restaurant is very beautiful inside but still comfortable with a come as you are atmosphere.  We started out with chips and 3 different kinds of salsa, a habanero and a red salsa and a green salsa. The green salsa was amazing! The street tacos were very good and I didn't want beans with my meal so they substituted fresh vegetables and it wasn't the normal frozen bag of carrots and broccoli, it had mushrooms and squash and peppers and was just tasty.   Don't be afraid of this place being in the same building as Sapphires, it is actually in the front corner of the building with it's own entrance and I wouldn't hesitate to bring my family. Decor is very nice with a huge bar and very comfy booths.   If you are in Vegas, you must go here and check them out. They also have happy hour and specials each day so check it out before going.   We will be back real soon!",

I arrived on a non-busy week night with my boyfriend for some food and drinks.  The hostess greeted us and sat us at a good table.  Our waitress came soon after and took out order.  We had a coupon that she presented to us.  After she got done rolling her eyes, she said that she had to ask the manager about the coupon.  The coupon was approved and we ordered our food.  While we were eating, we needed more fixings (sour cream, guacamole, tomato) so we asked out server for more.  She failed to mention that it costs extra for more sour cream!  As we were finishing up our meal, I guess it was taking to long for us to leave, so the server decided to put our check on the table and hover around until we put a credit card down.  Keep in mind we were only at the place an hour tops!  As we put the credit card down we again reminded our server that we had the coupon.  She took it with the check.  She came back and placed our receipt on the table.  We looked it over and she had not used the coupon!  When asked about this she simply said, \"Sorry about that. You can use it next time.\"  -Really Chick-  Never mind that we were from out of town.  I was beyond annoyed at this point!  For me, service can make or break a meal!

We went there a couple of times and the servers and bartenders were all really nice but their attention to detail could be improved. Several times we ordered something and the server forgot to bring it to us. The bartenders seemed to be too busy to acknowledge us. And our waiter would forget about us at key times, like after the food came. Overall they all seemed like really nice people and I would go here again, food was definitely good.",

The hostess was rude and we waited for a table forever and then people after us got a table! They give tables to big parties before anyone else because they figure they will make more money. They make you make a reservation but they still tell you it's a wait and then reserve it for bigger parties. It's all about how much money they will make instead of customer experience. And after 40minutes they tell us they have a table for us in the back somewhere behind a wall where it was dirty! Come on! Little do they know we usually spend a lot and have a huge tab on alcohol alone so we would have spent what a big party spends alone! So if it's just 2 people going there on a date you better forget it! Try taking more people because you won't get a table! We decided to leave and go somewhere else. It was ridiculous. End of rant. Went to sushi instead.",

My boyfriend ordered seafood enchiladas and was very disappointed. The shrimp in there were no bigger than a quarter and the scallops as well. Their prices are on the high end for Mexican in my opinion, $17 seafood enchiladas, $14 taco combo. They do offer 25% off for locals on Mondays.",

The last time I was there I could hear the chef in the back screaming for runners. It really put me off.   The food is great and you can order from Bite Squad which I highly recommend doing and have been doing for the past couple of months. I highly recommend their bowls.

First off, the menu was great because it clearly marked vegan and vegetarian options. I ordered the veggie bowl customized as vegan and felt super healthy eating it - the vegetables were fresh and it wasn't heavy. But my favorite part of dinner was the guacamole. It's made table side and is absolutely amazing. The guacamole came in a huge bowl that could have easily fed 4 people, but we managed to eat most of it between the 2 of us. Our server (I think his name was Jesse) was great, too! I let him know it was my husband's birthday and even though my husband said he didn't want dessert, Jesse brought out the birthday sombrero and a complimentary flan. My husband was stuffed from dinner, but ate almost the entire flan because it was so good.   Also, a huge plus to the restaurant being next to a strip club was that it took all of 2 seconds to get a cab after dinner. Thank you for the vegan options! We'll be back on our next Vegas trip.",

    "text": "My husband (who loves Mexican food) thinks I don't like Mexican food, because almost every time he asks if I want to go to a Mexican restaurant, I decline. Needless to say, he was rather surprised when I told him I couldn't wait to try El Dorado Cantina for dinner while we were visiting Vegas. While leaving the airport, I spotted a billboard for the restaurant, showcasing their use of organic and non-GMO ingredients. I was immediately intrigued! Since I'll only eat meat if it's organic, I was really excited to know that nearly everything on the menu would be available to me. On the first page of the menu, they list all of the vendors for every category of food they use in preparation of menu items. I love that kind of transparency!  We started with the red sangria, which is one of the best I've ever had. St. Germain is one of my favorite liqueurs, and that is one of the unique twists they have as a part of their sangria recipe. They brought us a complimentary basket of fresh tortilla chips, with a trio of fresh, delicious house made salsas: habanero, green, and red. For dinner I ordered the pulled chicken enchilada and my husband ordered carne asada street tacos. Both came with a side of black beans and cilantro rice. They were out of this world! My husband, who has gone to Mexico countless times on business, attested to the fact that this is truly authentic Mexican fare. We closed the evening with flan for dessert. Chef Paco himself delivered our dessert, spent a few minutes talking with us, and let us know the flan was his grandmother's recipe. Never before have I tasted a flan & actually wanted more than a bite or two. We cleaned the plate, and I actually contemplated ordering a second serving! Although it is off the strip, this is a destination well worth traveling the extra mile! Our server, Enrique, was charming, funny and knowledgeable. I look forward to coming back again the next time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "This place is amazing! My wife found it based on the awesome reviews, so we decided to check it out with friends visiting us from out of town. We each got five of the Specialty tacos. They are delicious. Every type was great. We love Mexican food, and we were hoping to find a great restaurant when we moved here. We definitely found it and this will be our new go to! Our waiter Chris was phenomenal. He made great suggestions and all of them were on point. He also made sure to check in with us so we never needed anything. Definitely ask for him when you come in; he's super friendly and so pleasant to talk to! Finally, to top it off, the Executive chef, Chef Paco, came around and introduced himself and talked to us for a few minutes. He also made a special desert for our friends young daughters who were dining with us. Trust me; come here. It's amazing and you'll love it!",

The food is excellent, every bite taste like Mexico, al pastor tacos, cactus tacos, mole enchiladas, and every bite it's worth what I paid for. My hands down Chef Paco. Best flan ever! I can't say enough. The service one of the best I ever had, Hugo is so professional and so warming and the man who clear our table, I wish I know his name. Thank you El Dorado restaurant for having such a great team. I fall in love with your restaurant",

Our bartender Kai was a great host. Highly recommended.   Update:  Went back for a second time after a Vegas show to hit up their late night happy hour. Happy hour prices had been raised by a couple bucks since the last time we were there, but what makes up for that is the excellent service from the bartenders, Mitch and Kai were great, very attentive and personable. Will be back again next time I'm in town! Great late night spot.",

We also got the Mole Enchiladas, which the chicken was also dry. The mole sauce was good and very flavorful. We got the free flan from the yelp check in and it was pretty tasty.

It was a little weird as you have to park in the strip club parking lot for the restaurant. The chips and salsa were great and the margaritas were STRONG. That being said the food was just so-so. Probably the part that was the most disappointing was the rice. It was ridiculously oily so I barely ate any of it. I had the rice bowl and there was a puddle of oil in the bottom of my bowl when I was done (see photo. It was called cilantro rice but I couldn't find any in it.  Another member of our party had the chicken quesadilla and found it to be pretty bland. The veggie burrito had a pretty good grilled flavor but it was somewhat ruined by the oily rice. The service was a bit slow but when we mentioned the issue with the rice, the manager did take care of our meal and even offered free dessert. I wish I'd been blown away by this place but probably won't be back.",

    "text": "Oh my various Gods! This place is just what Vegas needed - a Mexican restaurant that makes authentic Mexican food while at the same time taking gastronomical risks!   I know that this place isn't going to be for everybody. I also know that it takes a certain type of person to walk towards the blue neon of Sapphire at 2 AM for Mexican food. The unassuming entrance gives way to a modern dining room and bar. It's well lit, yet there's an abundance of velvet and mirrors and the knowledge of what is going on on the other side of that wall that give El Dorado its distinct Vegas-y vibe... This isn't the place for children to order quesadillas while their parents drink margaritas!  There are crickets on this menu.   Delicious, spicy, crickets. You should order them. You'll be a better person for it.   They also serve Ghost Pepper salsa. You should only order this if you're ready. The flavor is amazing but the heat is serious and lasting! If you're not sure just start off slow and see how much heat you can take (if the habanero salsa they gave you with the chips when you first sat down scared you then don't order the ghost pepper salsa!).  This salsa is one of the most wonderful things I've ever had so if you're of a type that enjoys the flavor of pain I highly recommend this salsa!  There are, of course, many traditional items on this menu that you'll recognize and love: fresh guacamole, tacos, burritos, enchiladas... But they also have a selection of mole` and that's what makes this place special. I tried the sampler plate and found each of them unique and enjoyable in their own way. My personal favorite being the darker, chocolate based mole`.  El Dorado Cantina is the kind of place you go to at the beginning or the end of a night of drinking, a refuge from the neon, sanctuary from boring Americanized Mexican food.",

    "text": "El Dorado Cantina is a really interesting, weird little spot that I did enjoy the experience/service of although I think my expectations may have been set too high in terms of the food.    To find El Dorado Catina, literally look for Sapphire as this restaurant will be right next to the entrance (co-owned? not sure).  I walked from Trump although the walk isn't exactly in the friendliest of areas so just be aware.    Come in - the service was pretty quick at around 7PM on a Friday night.  My server was very kind and knowledgeable.  To begin with, there are free chips and a few different sauces.  The sauces were really delicious and you're given a ton of chips.  Although one of the sauces I thought lacked flavor, one of the green sauces was awesome with a good spice and kick.  I then went onto the friend grasshoppers as it was a free Yelp check-in item.  Again, you're given quite a plentiful amount.  As my server told me - it's a very peculiar taste and very salty like a potato chip.  Definitely doesn't look as appetizing as it tastes but pretty fun for the adventurous/those that are fans.  Then I got the chicken bowl which came with rice/some veggies/chicken/guac.  The bowl was okay - I've had similar tasting bowls at other restaurants and for cheaper prices so I wasn't too blown away.  The house margarita too was just okay - you're given a pretty big cup for about +$10 but the taste wasn't too unique/distinct.    Perhaps I should have focused more on the other items on the menu or haven't found that one dish that really knocks me out of the park.  Either way, the experience was solid and I'll definitely make another visit to give it another try!",

First of all no one really mentioned it is sort of attached to the strip club sapphire so getting there/parking was a bit confusing. As for the food, I wasn't really impressed by anything. The carne asada tacos tasted pretty dry so I didn't finish them,  the queso dip was ok but not as flavorful as I would've thought for the way it looks, the carnitas tacos were ok but boring in terms of flavor. Maybe if I would have added a lot of toppings to each taco it would've been better but I shouldn't really have to. The best tacos for me were the cochinita because of the pickled habanero/onions on top adding to it's flavor and texture. The salsas were also good. But overall pretty disappointed.",

When we got to the location, we were shock to see that this was by a strip club. We were at first hesitant to go in because of this but we called the restaurant and they informed us that they were separate from the club. FYI - I had grandma and 2 girls with us.   When we came in, we were greeted by the ladies up front and they were very sweet. They walked us over to our table and we were handed the menu. I loved reading that they cared about where they get their food from. This is big for me.  Grace waited on us and she was amazing. We told her this was our first time and she was very patient and explained the menu in detail. She made recommendations and we were pleased with all the dishes she recommended, including the margaritas!!  It was my daughter's birthday and carefully orchestrated bringing out the cake, singing happy birthday and having her wear the sombrero. Overall, we were very satisfied with our experience. Grace made the experience very extraordinary. We will definitely be back because of her.",

Atmosphere I would rate this place a 10 it's very sexy in here and dark.  Food I would rate a 7 it was good but not omg for the prices we had the Table Guac which was delicious! Carne Asada tacos, A salmon dish idk what it was called but one of my guests eats kosher so she went with that, Fajitas and a few other things. Portions are big which isn't bad we were only 3 people but idk I like to try everything :) their Margaritas are on point! Give it a try",

    "text": "Thank You Chef Paco for a WONDERFUL meal. This food is REALLY REALLY GOOD.  So we were visiting Vegas for a weekend long Bday party and couldn't get babysitting. Yepp- the crack monkey's came with us. So much for the evening festivities. Alas, we had to be parents. Again.   We love to \"Yelp\" places when we are not at home. The hubs found this and pulled the trigger. We head over and as we are approaching the address....DOH! A STRIP CLUB??? Our 13 year old daughter quickly got out her iPhone spouting off how she LOVED new experiences and was ready to video tape this. I was like... Slow your roll, tween-bop! As long as I am alive you will continue on your path to cure Cancer, and keep the ass-shaking to the professionals. We saw a separate door for the restaurant, THANK GOD. She still took photos of the signage for the club and quickly texted it to her friends. Great. As soon as the other Soccer Mom's see the pics, I will have to relinquish my Mom o' the Year title.   It was Sat night, approximately 7:30pm, on April 18, 2015. We waited 10-15 min for a table. The Hellions were thrilled with the seating (a high table with stools) and we were thrilled with the kiddie menu's! Red velvet walls... felt a little naughty being next to the strip joint. The decor... CUTE. I even loved the drinking glasses.  Pricing is important to me. If dinner is bad, the first thing I think about is how my $100 could have bought me a few more shares of my fav stock. However, this dinner was nowhere near $100 and it was REALLY worthy of a higher price point. DON'T TELL CHEF PACO. Our  bill was $38. (No alcohol.... KIDS. REMEMBER?)  Here's what we had; The Heathons- kiddie flat steak, and they LOVED it. It came with potato chips (homemade). I tried both. TOTES DELISH. The portions were generous. Our daughter ordered off of this menu, (she looks 10, so I make her). She thought it wouldn't be enough food, but she was stuffed. Our son couldn't finish the steak, as it was just too large a portion for him. He is 10, but a petite eater. I had the chicken street tacos with black beans and rice. I asked for a keg of salsa to flavor my tacos because the salsas' were REALLY YUMMY. I felt bad leaving it there but the tacos were seasoned so well, that I just didn't need any. I should have taken it home so I could drink it later. Even the rice and beans were really tasty... authentic Mexican. Kid's meals came with dessert. FAB cream filled Churros w/ Mexican chocolate dipping sauce. We also got a free flan for \"checking in\" on Yelp.   Now, when it comes to flan, my white azz hubster THINKS he is THEE Mexican tasting authority. He swears most flan sucks, but he is a big lover of the dessert, and will try it EVERYWHERE in his quest for the RIGHT flan. I will be damned if Jesus didn't personally come down to bless this flan, as Hubster swears it was THE BEST flan he had ever had. For me, it was the CREAMIEST and TASTIEST flan I have ever had. As if this isn't enough, we find out, it's GRAMMA'S RECIPE! Yepp- Chef Paco uses his Gram's flan recipe. If I wasn't already married to the Albino fake Mexican stud that I am, I might make sweet love to Chef Paco in a vat of his Gram's flan. I mean, how sweet is that? He came by the table, by the way, and he IS, AS SWEET, as the flan. TOTES ADORBS! I believe our server's name was Marco. To quickly sum him up, he let our 10 year old ramble on about rollercoasters without the slightest irritation... on a Saturday night... TOTES AMAZEBALLS. GREAT SERVICE. GREAT CHEF. GREAT FOOD. GREAT RESTAURANT. We told all of our local friends about it.   Next time I visit, I plan on leaving the hubs and kids at home and getting drunk with these guys. How much trouble could I get in? I already lost my Mom 'o the Year status.",

I was an a big fan of the rice as well which was a very light grain with the perfect amount of cilantro.  If I had one complaint it would be the service. While it was great service I had trouble getting refills even though we were literally the only customers in the restaurant for more than half of our visit.",

    "text": "After a few attempts at grabbing late night grub at local yet over-crowded taco bars, we decided to try El Dorado Cantina. We initially passed by the location a few times due to a combination of the dark street, discreet signage and the unexpected location surroundings - but were pleased to receive some of the best service I have ever experienced, a great food selection in a very cool and relaxed environment.  Don't let the location deter you from trying this restaurant.  We were promptly greeted at the front door by the hostess who seated us at a back table. While the restaurant was a bit dark, it seemed chill/cool/clean.  Our most outstanding waiter, Andy, visited the table, discussed the menu with us and provided recommendations. He was able to name-drop the farms where El Dorado sources their meat and brought out watermelon agua fresca for us to try, be still my beating heart. I love agua fresca and their offering did not disappoint.  We opted for the:  Tableside Guacamole - Gluten Free & Vegan Chipotle Chicken Cochinita Pibil Watermelon Agua Fresca  The guacamole was on point and we ate so much, so quickly, that by time the food came out we didn't have much room left. As native Texans, we both should have known better than to eat 8,000 pounds of corn chips before a meal but who can say no to avocado. Andy made it so perfectly spicy, I wanted to cry (tears of happiness).  I found the Chipotle Chicken to be on the dry side, but the sauce balanced it out a bit. It should be noted that I took most of it home and promptly stuffed my face with it the next morning. It was my main source of fuel for the Rock n Roll marathon later that evening.  The service was outstanding, the food was solid, and the environment was both relaxed and comfortable. Definitely worth a visit.",

Perhaps if they turned up the Mariachi music and made an effort to drown out or hold your attention to forget whats next door. Or on other side of wall in same building! 24 hour business hours are a plus. They advertise organic, another reason to give it a try. Also upon arrival in parking lot, you will be directed to certain spots. And maybe not so close. Strip club is the main business there. And they wont let you park close.",

Highly recommend the happy hour menu, stay away from the chess quesadilla as it is relatively small for the $5 price tag. All street tacos are absolutely filling, I also recommend the new bartender on staff Victor....he's guaranteed me some revamped drinks and a new scene upon my next visit in January.

I know this is supposed to be the \"best Mexican restaurant in Vegas\" and it wasn't the worst, or even close, but wouldn't call it the best. Just would call it, \"pretty good\". We had a shrimp burrito, chicken burrito, flan, churros, and way too much chips and salsa. The chips and salsa were probably the best thing on the menu besides the churros. My shrimp burrito didn't have much flavor. My colleague, who is Costa Rican and Mexican, said it lacked a True kind of authentic feel but we knew that coming in. We did have a lot of food though for the price.",

Following my map it led me to Sapphires Gentlemen's Club & I thought \"Crap are we going to have to pay a cover??\" To my pleasant surprise the restaurant has its own entrance so we came inside.  Upon coming in we were greeted & told that the tables were full. Not a problem, we sat at the bar (I was craving a margarita anyway).   We were served chips & salsa (delicious by the way) while we read the food menu. After my margarita fix I got the pozole ($9.50) & my mister got shrimp tacos ($15.50). The pozole was very tasty & very authentic (trust me I know, I'm Hispanic & my grandma makes bomb pozole) & my mister enjoyed his shrimp tacos which came with a side of rice & beans.   Being locals, we will definitely be back. I've been wanting to find a good Mexican restaurant & I found my spot.   If you're visiting Vegas definitely check this place out, the food, drinks, customer service & atmosphere is really great.   Now if you don't mind I will be enjoying this beautifully presented flan & I have a lot of tequila left to finish!",

    "text": "Yes! Finally some solid Mexican food restaurants. The location is deceiving, so when you are pulling up off of Industrial you will pull into the parking lot for Sapphires. My husband and I circled around several times until we pulled in to what appears Sapphire's parking lot, and spotted that there was an entrance and a somewhat hidden/obstructed sign next to the entrance to the strip club.  We were pleasantly surprised by the decor and the classy vibe inside of the restaurant. There were comfortable booths and tables, along with a nice bar area which seemed packed. It seems to be a hot spot for younger, professional looking crowd and I can see why. The ambiance, service and the food would prompt me to take a client here for lunch.  They have a pretty extensive cocktail menu which I did not really go over. The server mentioned that their margaritas are not made with any pre made mixes and is sweetened with agave nectar and was offered in several flavors. I went with the Raspberry flavor per his suggestion. I enjoyed it, although still felt it was a bit sweet and the raspberry chunks kept clogging up my straw which got to be annoying. Get wider straws if you are putting chunks for fruit into the drink. Overall, I could taste the difference but I just wasn't in the mood to drink so I couldn't recommend this place based on the cocktail alone.  The chips (first round is complimentary) are decent, but nothing like what some people are raving about. I found them to be an unnecessary filler.  We ordered the Carne Asada, Carnitas burrito enchilada style in red sauce (choice of red of green) and al pastor tacos (comes in a set of 3, you can mix and match the flavors). The Carne Asada and the burrito were extremely delicious. They were served with cilantro rice that was so light, yet packed with flavor. I seriously could just eat the rice alone there and be happy. The meat was high quality with great portions. The burrito was filling, but given the nature of the ingredients it did not leave me feeling stuffed, instead I felt satiated and full. The tacos were not impressive to me because the al pastor tasted dry and I had to use one of the left over salsas from the chips to pour over them. I am accustomed to juicy and flavorful al pastor and this just did not deliver. It tasted as if it was under a heat lamp for a bit too long.  The prices are not cheap, but you do get what you pay for. The burrito was around $16 and the Carne Asada around $25. The service was attentive and pleasant. Overall we felt it was money well spent and intend on coming back soon to sample more of their menu.",

Loud music, Shakira playing on their TVs we were hydrating after day drinking so were just on a water mission.  This place has the best salsa verde of my life. Could not stop eating the free chips + diff salsas. We ordered the nachos which we annihilated Ino protein added) split the chicken enchiladas served with black beans and rice + al pastor (2) and carnitas (1) tacos. Out of these dishes, I would pick the enchiladas over the tacos. They pride themselves with being organic which is noble but the al pastor lacked the fatty flavor which I love in taquerias.   It slowed down when we dined around 10 PM and our food came out quick but our server Roark was a little spotty with service. It took a while to get our waters refilled and he didn't really check on us. Another female server came by to check on us to let us know that he stepped out for a moment. Tasty and fun atmosphere, we are fans.",

Our table also ordered carnitas and carne asada street tacos. Both were soooo good! The carnitas was really tender and juicy. The Pozole was awesome as well.

On the inside the decor is really nice.   The free chips were good and the 3 different salsas pretty good.  I liked the hot orange habanero.    Next we had the table side guacamole, which how can you mess up, so it was pretty good.  Next came the pork tacos, I guess I liked these the least.  The pork had a really porky taste to it.  That tells me, the pork was not fresh, not bad, but close to the end of it life.  So with so many good reviews maybe it was a bad day, not sure.  I just wasn't very happy with the pork tacos.  So overall it wasn't bad, the location a little odd, but once your inside its nice.  I may try this place again, but skip the pork and try something else.",

Thank you Mr. Feinstein for taking good care of us! The decor is a lot of fun and it's a very sexy looking Mexican joint. The food is great as well and after several tequila shots everyone is having a party. I love work nights like this because we all continue our bonding :)  So in between many shots sent our way we also had all sorts of great cocktails from traditional margaritas to the specialty house drinks. They all pack a punch and were great.   The food was so good! The cheesy thing that had onions, mushrooms, peppers and other goodies that you dipped your chips in as well as flour tortillas was so great. We ordered a ton of good stuff from some street tacos, steak bowl & even the Feinstein special which was my favorite dish. It had chicken, crispy onions, a fried egg all on side potato chips. (My memory is blurry from the tequila) but I remember enjoying every bite.   We had a lot of fun here and will definitely be back.

It's pretty good though, clean, has awesome service and is open 24/7. The only caveat is that it's on the expensive side.  Within seconds, we were quickly escorted to our tables and got complimentary chips. Our waiter, Juan, was extremely accommodating throughout the entire meal. He made sure our drinks were refilled constantly and came to check on us routinely throughout our lunch.   I ordered the shrimp tacos with refried beans and cilantro rice rice for $18.50. I really, really enjoyed my dish. The meat was super tasty and you could tell it was well-seasoned from the kitchen. I could taste the citrus marinated grilled wild Pacific shrimp with every bite mixed with fresh organic guacamole, organic cabbage & pico de gallo. There was also a dash of chipotle ranch dressing, which made it even more mouth-watering.  Overall, I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good Mexican food. We checked-in on Yelp and even got a free Flan courtesy of the chef, Paco. He even came out of the kitchen to introduce himself, which was awesome. It seemed a bit staged though -- you know, us redeeming a coupon on Yelp and him coming outside to greet us. But hey, it was a nice touch in my opinion.",

There is VERY small signage on the street stating that El Dorado Cantina is located there...but the sign for the strip club...HUGE. Lol! We went inside not realizing that reservations are needed. But the hostess and manager was VERY accommodating and actually sat us immediately.  Of course we had to try their famous guacamole...since it's touted as the best in Vegas. I was NOT disappointed. If I could describe it in just a few words...life changing would be it.  I also had their Al Pastor street tacos with a side of rice (HIGHLY recommend) and we also ordered the enchiladas. Everything was absolutely outstanding. So glad we stopped here for dinner and can't wait to come back!! I'm gonna be dreaming about that guacamole for months to come!!!",

I think every single time I've come here for a pick up I've either had to wait 40 mins or the food was wrong and I had to wait even longer. Ordered food at 630 had a pick up time of 654 arrived at 702 to my surprise the food was ready but shocker it was made wrong. Instead of a veggie salad they made a veggie burrito. So let the waiting begin it is now 726 and still no salad watched a ton of food come out to guests eating in restaurant but no salad. Favi the manager was less than helpful in my opinion if I noticed food was wrong and I was the manager I would have my kitchen expedite the food. In the mean time all of my hot food is getting cold eat in but don't bother with take out in my opinion.",

Autumn informed us on the amazing vegetarian options for us and how they use non GMO ingredients. I also loved her presentation on the table side guacamole. It was the best guacamole I have tried and went home and made it myself extactly how she made it. Overall my experience was pleasent and we will be back to eat again.

I was very happy to see vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free items were clearly identified as I recently started following a gluten free diet.  Everyone in my party ordered tacos and we were not disappointed!  Tacos come with a side of rice and black or refried beans.  I got the carne asada.  The meat was tender and seasoning was very tasty.  I didn't mind not having Spanish rice at all because the white cilantro rice was so good along with the black beans.  My only complaint was the temperature of my food was not hot.  I almost sent it back but was starving and tired so I happily ate away.  Didn't have any alcoholic drinks but my sisters did and they both liked theirs.  I'd definitely go back!  If you go, don't forget to check-in on Yelp for your free flan.  It was flantastic.",

We started off with the table side guacamole which was so fresh, it was like eating a garden. Large portion too! We also had the Mexican corn (why have we never had this?). It was like cream corn on a stick. Yum. I could eaten two but wouldn't have had room for the main course. I had the grilled mahi tacos and my GF had the Mole sampler. The tacos were great. Only two tacos but I wouldn't have been able to eat three. The mole sampler, well I'll just say that the traditional and the chipotle mole were to die for. My fave was the chipotle. The mole verde was.......different. Not the best thug on the plate. Something just didn't go together.  All in all this little place is a \"find\" and worth the drive. Even though it's right next to a \"gentleman's club\", so what. Try the jalapeno margarita. We'll be back!",

Had a delicious Mojito; the at table-made guacamole is good and they will make it to your taste. Our server Erika was excellent and gave us good advice as we ordered. The Pozole soup is delicious- a bowl is a a meal in itself! Chicken enchiladas were great, wished we'd been able to try the Mahi tacos...maybe next time! When we told the waitress that we read excellent yelp reviews she brought us a free flan for dessert which was superior to any other flan I've ever had- super creamy! We were there for a late lunch so it wasn't too busy. We were surprised that Paco the chef came out to say hello! (He's been featured on Food Network's Taco show.) He told us his recipes are his mothers and grandmothers - all GMO free. It's just off the strip but this place is worth it!",

    "text": "The Price is very steep for being a basic Mexican restaurant. And the service is terrible........  Came here on a Sunday morning at 12pm. Super disappointed.... There are amazing reviews but nothing was a 4/5 star for me at any point.....  The restaurant wasn't even busy, yet we had to wait 20 mins before getting seated. We were so stoked to try this place after seeing so many good reviews and the food looked so good.  The waiting area was a bit awkward because there was a table right next to it. I felt bad for the people eating there because I can only imagine how uncomfortable they were. We finally got seated. This is where everything went downhill.. The hostess and waiter was recommended dishes we should try so we went ahead and got some dishes they recommended. They set chips and salsa on the table right away which gave me the impression that it was going to be a good experience.... We ordered 2 drinks, 1 pineapple juice , and 3 pineapple and watermelon drink, along with our ice waters. We started with the fried shrimp (app dish), Carne asada plate, guacamole, 1 chicken , steak, and shrimp fajita. steak and chicken fajita plate.  3 tacos al pastor, and a shrimp burrito.  So ill go ahead and break down our experience... The shrimp app came out and we were pretty impressed. The dipping sauce was light and tasty. Next, the guac was being made right in front of us. We told our waiter we wanted a level 7 out of 10 spicy level.... It was mild..... no spice what so ever. The fajitas came out next. Oh the disappointment. $28 for the steak and shrimp, not bad... $34 for shrimp added, but guess what!? only 3 shrimps.....  They forgot the tortillas. (it took 10 mins to get the tortillas out.) The burrito came out next.... this was my dish. I wanted to get the pineapple shrimp, but the waiter recommended the burrito because i'd \"get my money's worth.\" I bit into it and there was so shrimp to be found.... I opened up my burrito and not surprisingly, only 5 shrimps...What a waste of money!!!!! It was full of rice and beans.  The carne asada plate came out. We were told it wasn't as good, but the plate ended up being the best of everything...  At this point, the drinks still didn't come out.. we were still waiting for al pastor tacos....  Everyone was almost done eating and our waiter asked, \"Did you ever get your drinks?!?! and is there anything else I can get you?\" Ya...... we never got our drinks, and were still waiting on our tacos. The tacos and drinks finally came out.  I felt so bad for my friend who got the tacos. It's the simplest dish out of the 6 dishes but came out last. Our waters did not get refilled throughout our entire stay.....  The food is not good..... The 4 stars must be from people who don't eat mexican food, or drunk people! Perhaps I came on the wrong day?!  Never again... Def do not recommend.",

The only think they need is fish ceviche and more brands of draft beer , like xx and budlight , well is my opinion , overall this is a excellent restaurant. I recommend 200 % I am a mexican and I know when the food is authentic Mexican food. Stop by and say hi to Fabiola .",

The rest of the staff stopped by periodically to check on us too. I usually don't care for all the check ins but they did it without interrupting. The food...ok, was unbelievable. We got the table side guacamole and it was fresh and delicious. We decided not to get serano peppers or tomatoes in it. It's 2 whole avocados which was too much for us. You get 1 free basket of chips and salsa, the green Verde salsa was awesome. I wanted to buy a gallon of it. My wife and I split the carnitas street tacos-3 on the plate with beans and rice. The meat was so juicy and tender; very delicious. We saw all the reviews on Yelp about this place  and decided to try it. We were very excited that they disclose where all their ingredients come from and that it is very \"clean and healthy\"....we are ALL for that. We will be coming back. Thank you El Dorado!!!!",

The caramel sauce was sweet (no burnt bitter flavor) and the flan did not taste like eggs. Highly recommend.   Tres leches was delicious too, the milk has a great vanilla and rum like flavor.   The orange sorbet is both sweet and tart but not overwhelming.   Would highly suggest the desserts!",

He was very knowledgeable on the different dishes and described them in great detail. My family ended up ordering a few appetizers and they were impressed with all of them.   When it came to ordering main plates they got a couple things to all share, also recommendations by the waiter. He knew that I was vegan and was very helpful in providing options for me and sharing his opinions. I got a veggie bowl and it was even better than I thought it would be. It was so big I couldn't eat it all on my own and I was very impressed.   If you're wanting some Mexican food when you're in Vegas go to El Dorado, you won't regret it.",

It seems like the staff is more worried about completing their duties then tending to the guests. We waited 30 minutes for our food, then asked our bartender (we were eating at the bar) 2 times within 15 minutes for more salsa, I had to remind him a third time for him to get it. It is also an up charge for another dish of salsa that really has so spice or flavor. At the end of the meal the bartender seemed so rushed he actually dropped the dish and splashed food all over my fathers arms. The food we ordered was good but it was room temperature, which was weird because the plate was very hot. Again, friendly staff, but extremely long service.",

Service was quick at first then slowly disappeared as the employees were hanging out behind the bar with few tables to wait on.   The food came out late and cold. The cilantro rice is usually buttery and soft, now dry and cold. The burrito also dry and cold. Table side guacamole and salsa was the only pro tonight. The margaritas weren't worth it for the price and the cucumber jalapeno was not good. They comped my buddies burger for cooking it wrong. Then went to comp us a flan for good measure, only to see they put it on our tab until we asked them to remove it. Also included on the tab was salsa that is supposed to be free and a side of rice and beans, to which we never received the beans.   So many good memories here in the past but very unimpressed especially for bringing new friends to finally try out.",

The green salsa was slightly sweet and had a little heat at the end - The pozole wasn't that good.  Ok flavor, but pozole should be overflowing with hominy.  There might have been ten pieces of hominy in my cup - The table side guacamole was excellent.  Chunky, salty, and just the right touch of lime - The shrimp taquitos were pretty good.  The shrimp was tender (and I could taste it) and the plate had just the right amount of salsa, guac, and cheese - The carne asada street tacos were average at best - The carnitas street tacos were great  I probably won't be back because the neighborhood skeeved me out a bit, but I could be forced back if someone really wanted to go.",

I really don't know what restaurant everyone is raving about, but it's definitely not El Dorado Cantina.  This review comes after a second visit, the first was equally unimpressive.  The highlights: friendly staff and the queso fundida. The lowlights: confused staff, bland entree, bland side dishes, and runny salsa  I can't stress how disappointed I was in my entree... tacos al pastor, one of my favorite Mexican dishes. Heavily seasoned, sweet and spicy, a little crusty outer layer of meat with juicy, tender insides, layered with the complex flavors of chilis, pineapple and onion. Well, that's not the dish I was served. I must have accidentally ordered bland, rubbery disappointment.  If you're looking for good Mexican food near the strip, spend your money at Tacos el Gordo or Tacos & Beer instead.  Otherwise, save your visit to this restaurant for when you're drunkenly stumbling out of Sapphire nextdoor.",

    "text": "That's right five stars. Because any restaurant in Vegas that is willing to stand against using GMO food deserves five stars! There's so much organic food on the menu, I feel like I'm eating at a whole foods.  That's the catch. The location of this restaurant is not ideal. My mom flew in to town for my birthday and of course she wanted to take me out to dinner. I chose this place because Mexican food is my favorite! My husband was driving us. I see the gentleman's club, Sapphire. I say, \"where the heck is this place? We should be close.\" My husband shouts out, \"it's here!\" And he turns in to Sapphire's. I thought he was joking. My mother was mortified. She even evoked my middle name and asked what I was thinking!  Long story short, we went in to the restaurant with our eyes down for fear of what we might see. Low and behold, we saw a restaurant. Even though it shares a building with Sapphires, the two are separate.   The food is extremely delicious! Fresh tasting-which makes sense when the food is GMO free. Their mole sauce... No words can describe the richness. Try it! Pay no attention to the building next door.  Oh, and the service... May be a little slow at first, however, once you let them know in a way that you've been waiting, they won't be slow the rest of the service. Did I mention the mariachi music?",

Now, the drink I ordered (pain killer) was strong but very good! And my husband LOVED the chapulines! Chips and salsa were also very good. I ordered mahi and I can't really describe how gross it was; unseasoned, charred on grill, super fishy smelling and tasting, with a dry mango salsa on a bed of rice. Literally, I took a small bite and it took a lot to not spit it out. I told my waiter my food was awful and got asada tacos instead. The manager came by to ask about the fish and was apologetic. The tacos were ok, much better than the mahi. My husband had a asada torta that was ok. We ordered flan that was thicker than I'm used to but good (manager comp'd my dessert for the mahi mishap). The entrees, I feel, are not worth the price BUT drinks and appetizers are where it's at here. We'll return for the appetizers and drinks.",

I was happy when they offered us a kids menu and some crayons for my 3 year old son. I wasn't sure if it was going to be that kid friendly, but I felt very welcomed. Like most Mexican restaurants, you get a complimentary basket of chips, but these are house made and baked in sunflower oil, and you can really taste the difference. Plus you get three different salsas to dip them in with different spice levels.  The food came out quickly, was hot, flavorful and filling. What more could you ask for? I know, a Summerlin location!",

Conveniently (depending on your perspective) located next to Sapphires gentleman's club, El Dorado Cantina serves very fresh, very tasty Mexican food at a reasonable price point.   The service was friendly, although there was a bit of a mixup regarding who had taken our drink order and the delivery of said beverages.   The chips and salsa were fine, nothing too remarkable, and served with 3 different types of salsa. The hottest sauce had a lot of heat, but not tons of flavor. The others were good, but nothing special.   I ordered the shrimp tacquitos, which were a good portion size, and filled with lots of shrimp. One standout was the guacamole, which was some of the best i have had, and there was lots of it.   My favorite part of the meal was dessert! Thanks to my Yelp check in, we received a free order of churros. They were amazing. They had a banana filling inside and the dipping sauces were the perfect complement.  I would definitely return- and maybe next time I will stop by and visit the ladies next door!",

The entrance is so small compared to Sapphire's big entrance that you might not see it if you weren't looking closely. The place is pretty huge, but dimly lit, had large booths and tables, good for large parties.   Guacamole is wayyyy overpriced..but that is because they bring out a sexy lady to make the guac at the table. We ordered Imperial Shrimp which was tasty enough, Pozole which was alright, Taquitos which was pretty good, and Chapulines (grasshoppers) which really didn't have any flavors. You can get better foods elsewhere for cheaper.   Maybe a nice place for men to go have some drinks and snacks, would not recommend as a dinner date place.",

You enter just to the left of the gentleman's club.   Our waiter Chris was very friendly and helpful, he made good recommendations including the jalapeno margarita and brought samples of both the pineapple and the watermelon Agua fresca to help make the decision which to get (both super good by the way).   You could easily come here and just feast on appetizers, they are so good! My friend and I ordered the guacamole which is custom made table side, as well as the Queso fundido, and we should have probably stopped there because that's more than enough food for 2. However, we didn't stop there. We also had an order of the Al Pastor tacos and finished it off with an order of flan (free with your first yelp check in!). We were pleasantly stuffed when we were done, and even had some dip to spare!   Seems like it could be the perfect spot to start a guys night out, or a bachelor party since it IS right next door to a gentleman's club.",

This place kept popping up on my Instagram and I think I yelped Vegan Mexican food and it came up. I looked the menu and was instantly intrigued! They have quite a few options they are able to make vegan, and gluten free dishes as well if that's an issue for you as well! Mexican food veganized is one of my favorites these days!  The restaurant is nice inside, very spacious and has those round booths so you can just cupcake in there or whatever  They automatically start you off with chips and and a salsa trio too. I love me some authentic salsa. The mild was actually my favorite as far as taste goes but I wish it had been the spicy one! The spiciest one was just like FIRE. Not really too much flavor in it, just HOT. I ended up ordering the Veggie Bowl with brown rice and black beans. Unfortunately the cilantro rice isn't vegan otherwise I would have been all over that!  They use the freshest ingredients, NON GMO products thank you very much! My bowl with FILLED with veggies and I'm eating the leftovers right MEOW!  I love restaurants that have really opened up to being able to cater to all types of different diets! I also love that all the vegan dishes were fresh veggies and didn't include meat substitutes. NOM NOM NOM! If you're feeling some Mexican food, definitely go try out this spot! This is right next to Sapphires so go eat and then get your stripper fix! They have female AND male strippers for you to drool over!  HAHAHA.",

Service couldn't be beat....Emily was our server and was very attentive even with it being a busy lunchtime.  We ordered Albondigas soup and split a pulled chicken burrito and of course had a house margarita.  Soup was extremely hot but once cooled down was very good.  The burrito is a quite generous portion and was excellent, their rice is buttery cilantro and again a very generous portion.  When they ask if you want black beans or refried and it comes with guacamole, they are inside the burrito which makes it a wonderful combination of flavor.  Came home with half of the burrito to enjoy later.",

We were quickly greeted at our table with chips and 3 different salsas.   Beware, the habanero is hot.  Watch out before digging in.  We started with the guacamole, made at the table.  Delicioso.  Next onto the shrimp cocktail.   Prepared perfectly, and dont think twice about taking a chip and getting the pico from the glass.   You will thank me later.  Fresh and tasty.  You can really taste the differnce organic tomatoes make in all of their dishes.  Next up....taquitos unlke any we ever had.  Usually these are a hot mess at the crappy mexican joints, but not here.   The chicken was perfect with a smokey taste.  Yummy!  Finally, you can't and shouldn't walk out of this place without trying the flan.  Unbelievable!  Chef Paoo stopped by the table to ask about our meal.  Nice touch.  You can really tell from talking with Paco, he cares about th quality of th food.    Dont let the locations fool you.   Sure, its next to a strip club, but we felt safe the entire time.  This place is awesome and worth th effort to find.  ps....open 24 hours for those late night munchies!",

For our meals we ordered the carnitas platter, beef sopas, chicken enchiladas, and veggie tacos. The carnitas platter is huge, enough for two or three people and so moist and delicious! Everything was out of this world!!! Hands down the best Mexican food I've had anywhere!!! The rice, by the way, is heaven !!!! The owner came out and said hi and gave us flan !!!

I do want to say that the prices are a little bit on the pricey side, but it can be expected because they use NON-GMO ingredients.  Overall the food is good, but the service is awful. The waitresses have their boobs hanging out of their shirts in these tiny little spaghetti straps as if we were dining at Hooter's or something. Yeah, it is located next to a gentlemen's club, but that shouldn't mean it has to be associated with it (I understand that it may be a uniform, but you might want to reconsider bringing your kids with you). The few times we have been there the waitresses hardly come to check on you or even seem like they want to be there, but who knows maybe they were just having a bad day.

    "text": "Where do I even start! Well first off this don't let this place put you off by being right next to a strip club. They have their seperate entrance and it's no problem to bring your kids. The first time we visited I had the tropical salad. By salad standards it was so delicious. This second time dining here just surpassed all my expectations. It was National Taco Day on taco Tuesday so they had a promotion on their signature tacos for ONLY  $1!!!! I actually found this posted on Facebook. You really can't go wrong with dollar tacos anywhere, especially when El Dorado is promoting it. They had so much to choose from. However the promotion only allowed 5 tacos max per person so I had to choose wisely.  SIGNATURE TACO CHOICES:  - Queso Mexicano - Short rib - Salmon - Lengua - Cactus - Cabeza - Chili Verde Pork w/ chicharron FAVE - Octopus & Chorizo - Langostino  My husband and I choose differently so I got to taste them all and they were all absolutely scrumptious. Cooked and made to perfection. When we got them the manager (I want to say) presented them all to us. Which is something that I appreciate.  For dessert we ordered fried ice cream and flan. The chef, Chef Paco came out and presented the dessert and personally gave us his card. He was such a nice guy. He even gave our boys churros filled with dulce de le he. Free of charge. Lets talk about the desserts. Fried ice cream... it's fried! duh! of course it was delicious. The boys churros! Their lucky it was for them. 2 seconds it woulda been gone had I had my way. And the flan... TIP: check in with yelp and get a FREE FLAN!!!!  Don't miss out on this incredible offer. Incredible because their flan IS THE BEST I have EVER HAD!!! I'd come back just for the flan. No joke!  What I forgot to mention in the beginning was that we ordered margaritas on the rocks because it was the only happy hour drink they were offering away from the bar. I hate to say this because I love this place but the drinks were really disappointing. To me it was more of a limemade with a hint of Tequila. Hopefully in the future they can get the Tequila and mix ratio right.  Our waters were always filled and our waitress Ericka was so sweet and always made sure we were ok. Service like this, sadly isn't everywhere I dine at, so I really appreciate and praise when a business shows that they really care for their customers.  You can count on our family and friends on coming back for more of the phenomenal, organic goodness this restaurant has to offer. Thanks again to the staff at El Dorado Cantina for taking care of us.",

Beyond that, they serve local, organic, free-range and hormone-free ingredients. WOW!   The sangria was absolutely unbelievable, refreshing, tasty and amazing. The carne asada tacos were juicy, flavor-rich and authentic. The chips came with three different sauces, each delicious and unique.   The flan (for dessert) was hands-down the best flan I have EVER had! And I have had some darn good ones, believe me.   To top it off, the executive chef (Paco) came to our table to talk to us and spent several minutes engaging us. We were truly gratified and wowed. He shared with us stories, including how the recipe for the flan belongs to his grandmother. He gave us his card, which contains his personal contact info. WHO DOES THAT?!   We are happy to recommend this restaurant to all of our friends and everyone else, and we can't wait to return and dine!",

Although they can not guarantee it, they strive to provide the most Gluten Free vegetables, Organic and yard feed Chicken and Beef.  Their banquet room is great for dates special occasions such as birthday parties, wedding receptions, etc. A plus is, the provide catering.  Their  menu has a wide variety of food which ranges from seafood to poultry, beef, veggies.  My flavor, Chicken Taquitos - Gluten Free, made with Mary's Free Range organic pulled chicken, topped with organic romaine lettuce, salsa cascabel, pico de gallo, organic sour cream & queso fresco.   The cost is reasonable 10.50.. fits my pocket book just right.  What caught my eye was the fact that they carry over 100 types of Tequilas and a larger variety of wine, beer and spirits.",

I was pleasantly surprise with the decor with the rich reds and dark woods, trendy and chic. You get the typical chips and house salsas which were three and all very good. We ordered Guacamole, prepared table side this was good, Chiliquilles with Carne Asada which was delicious the green sauce was perfect, Chile Relleno, fried just right that the batter soaked up all the red sauce and cheese was melted, Chicken Enchilada, the taste and seasoning was good it was just dry, lastly the Flan, so rich and creamy I had to box what little piece was left.  I informed the wait staff about the dry Enchilladas and Chef Paco came to serve our dessert, apologized for the mishap with the new cook that forgot to add sauce inside and offered to make us a new one to take home. we declined and told him next time we will take the offer. He gave me his business card and coupons for our return. That was a pleasant surprise and it really shows that as a Chef and owner that he cares about the service and quality.   I definetely recommend this place for the great food and exceptional service.",

Update: Aug. 2019 Chef Paco never disappoints! He added new stuff to the menu and it is delicious! I had never tried duck before but his duck tacos were amazing. Make sure you get the flan. Best I've ever had in my life!",

On Tuesday they have a special. Don Julio 1942 shots for $6. They could slap you on the way in and way out but if that deal is on the table you take it. The food portions are massive but average in taste. On food alone I'd give it a 3.5. The service is attentive so that's a 5 but considering you get $6 42 shots the entire place is a 5. Can't speak for any other day but Tuesday gets a 5.",

I really liked the fact that the plates themselves didn't come out hot so to me that indicates that the food wasn't just sitting under a heat lamp or reheated. Everything tasted really fresh.",

    "text": "This place is definitely a diamond in the rough. Located a couple miles off the epicenter of the Las Vegas strip, this Mexican restaurant is easy to miss as it's located in a seedy little parking lot literally right next to a strip club/\"gentleman's club.\"  I came to eat here before heading back to California and I had my two, little dogs with me. I was waking up to the restaurant and was going to tie them to a tree outside while I had lunch but the manager Doris Siemen saw us coming and opened the door for us and allowed us to bring our two dogs inside and immediately offered a water bowl to them. Extra bonus points for that.   The ambiance is really nice. Dim lighting with almost a vampire-ish black and red themed interior. Full bar with TVs around so good for watching games.  You get chips and salsa right off the bat. Yum and always a plus. I ordered a mango margarita to start: it could have been better, it was a little too syrupy with too much ice. Then we ordered the table guacamole and they make it fresh in front of you and you can tailor it how you like. That was awesome. For my entree I got the chicken enchilada plate. It was DELICIOUS. The pulled chicken was so flavorful and tender and it comes with a side of cilantro rice and beans but I'm not a fan of beans so I always sub for a side salad. I left this place stuffed and satisfied and recommend this place if you want quality Mexican food and don't want to deal with the hassle of finding parking and walking a lot!",

What I ordered: Tableside guacamole, chicken taquitos appetizer, and chipotle chicken with rice and beans.   Gluten free options: 5/5 El Dorado Cantina has one of the most extensive gluten free menus that I have ever seen. Practically 80% of the menu is gluten free and all items are marked using a legend system. If you see the little wheat symbol, then the item is gluten free. Simple yet effective.  Food: 5/5 Food is always delivered hot, flavors are out of this world, and portion sizes are not small, so definitely come hungry. The tableside guacamole is a must-order. Chicken taquitos were large and juicy. They drizzle a cilantro avocado sauce on top with a little sour cream...ohh myyy. I usually order the chipotle chicken entree because I always remember how good it is. Thinly fileted grilled chicken with peppers and onions in a creamy chipotle sauce.   Service: 5/5 Tonight our server was Danny, who Has served my table in the past. He's attentive, shows up right on time, and makes sure you have everything you need. Food is typically delivered pretty quickly. It's amazing how fresh the food is, even though the wait isn't very long.  Location: 3/5 Not really a \"family\" friendly location, as it is literally in the same building as a very large strip club. But don't worry, there is a separate entrance to the restaurant. However, parking is ample and the restaurant is not hard to find. Just look for the glowing neon blue lights of Sapphire.  Ambiance: 4/5 The booths are very comfortable, as well as the high tables with barstools. Comfortable environment.  Overall score: 5/5",

    "text": "The location did not deter us from trying this place.  Came here mid-week at around 7 for dinner.  I must admit I thought that based on the cars in the parking lot the place would be packed but, nope, one other table and someone sitting at the bar.  Who knew Strip clubs are so packed on a Tuesday night.    I had the sangria and the steak fajitas.  The best part of the meal is the rice that has been mentioned in other reviews.  It's not that my meal was bad but it wasn't mind blowing, which I expected based on the 1200 plus reviews.  Also, a turn off for me is being charged for chips after your first complimentary bowl.  Their price point is high for what you are getting so free chips should not be a problem.  Also not a fan of how they present the receipt.  The tortillas showed up as a an additional charge even though they appear to come with the meal.  The mango in the mango margarita also showed up as an additional charge as did the the wet burrito.  That's the only charge that makes sense to me because that is an order modification.  Maybe this is just the way their computer system works but they should fix it so it doesn't look like you're paying extra for everything.  That was a turn off to me.  I do love how this place is decorated, and when we finished with our meal the waiter advised that if we checked in on Yelp we would get complimentary flan.",

    "text": "Let me just say that the idiom \"don't judge a book by its cover\" is the best way to describe this place. Don't let the location of this place deter you from trying it out because I guarantee you that you will be missing out on really amazing food.        The restaurant is directly connected to a Sapphire's Club strip club as in the door to the strip club is probably several feet off to the side of it which is located close to the strip behind the Fashion Show Mall in what looks to be stripper sex lane.  Pay no mind to any of that.        This place piqued our interest because it's 24/7 and it just doesn't get any better than that in the city that never sleeps, but it also has a promotional free flan with check-in offer. My partner in crime has been in an epic search for the best flan out there. The decor is really pretty with satin looking crafted roses as wall paper set against a more dim setting and a spacious area that has rounded booths, elevated tables as well as a bar area.       We got a complimentary basket of nachos that was served with chipotle? (brownish) and a tomatillo salsa. Both of the salsas were flavorful, fresh and a refreshing change to the pico de gallo that is often served with nacho chip baskets. We ordered queso fundido as our appetizer. Flour tortillas are an additional $1, but it's not that big of a difference because the corn tortillas were delicious.  It arrived piping hot in a skillet and was quickly devoured in all of its melty, cheesy goodness.  For entrees, we chose the beef enchiladas in red sauce as well as a trio of tacos.  You can choose three tacos for $13. It may seem steep in price in comparison to the taco joints we're all used to frequenting on Tuesdays or into the wee hours of morning after clubbing,  but it's definitely worth it. We selected cochinita, carnitas and al pastor. Neil accidentally brought carne asada instead of al pastor, but he quickly went to get the al pastor and let us keep the carne asada.      The carne asada was delicious,  but didn't make much of an impression on me. I always choose carne asada at my taco joints, but hey its way healthier here.  The al pastor complimented the sweetness of the pineapple chunks.  The cochinita was so flavorful and juicy. I have to really talk about the carnitas here. I have never had such flavorful and juicy carnitas in my entire life that is also organic. And I lived in East LA my entire life! Just thinking about that carnitas taco has me wanting to go back to Vegas. It's just taco heaven! All we were missing were Micheladas and everything would be complete.  The tacos are stacked with meaty goodness. My beef enchiladas came with a flavorful red sauce,  black beans (Your choice of black or pinto), and lime rice.  The black beans were standard and the rice was good, but nothing special for me.  I much prefer the fluffy, red rice that the suegra cooks up. Yum! The enchiladas were filled up with so much delicious beef. El Dorado also offers a seasonal variety of freshly made aguas - Neil offered us a sample of pina and jamaica (By sample,  I mean decent glass). The jamaica was ok, but the pina was great.  It had the perfect blend of sweetness that was subtle,  but delivered the pineapple flavor home.       Now, the piece de resistance!  We were stuffed,  but just had to try some dessert. Neil took our complimentary flan check-in and we ordered some churros. The churros were perfectly crunchy with a soft core.  The caramel filling was a nice touch and could be enjoyed standalone. I really enjoyed the bananas foster one. It tasted similar and had the same consistency of a caramel dip, but tasted much better.  Now, I used to love flan,  but had too much,  effectively killing my taste bud for it. My partner in crime was anxiously anticipating the flan ever since we yelped it. The flan was cooked perfectly.  The caramelization of the sugar was just right. The texture of the flan was closer to a custard.  We both preferred a slightly more formed flan,  but with each bite came a flooding of goodness that our taste buds greedily gobbled up. It was a pretty divine.  Even the whipped cream and raspberry decorative garnish tasted delicious and real (organic).      I can't rave any more about this place,  then I already have.  For starters,  it's great to see a server such as Neil who is attentive and on top of his duties.  Often times,  a great restaurant can be ruined by a horrible dining experience which is usually attributed to the servers.  Neil not only was informative,  but he was ready and available to answer any questions and owned up to the taco.  He was delightful to have as a server.  Chef Paco even took the time to bring out the complimentary flan.  After 1,000+ reviews, it was so nice to see a chef take pride and joy in his work. The biggest thing about this place is how healthy and organic everything is without sacrificing or compromising taste. This is gonna be a go to place for us whenever we're in Vegas.",

You can't really tell from the pictures, but the portions are pretty big, so be careful if you aren't in a position to take leftovers.

    "text": "The most amazing restaurant ever. Employees are amazing nd the chef, off the hook. Chef Paco is the most friendly person ever. Takes the time to come to the table and talk to us and ask us how outer experience was. He cares about the customers nd that our standards are met. I am a very picky eater nd the food here is amazing. The tacos nd the The enchiladas omg!!! You must try the flan and tres leches. A restaurant not only is great when the food is on point, but when you have good service nd a amazing chef, you will definitely come back. I live in San diego and I will definitely be returning... if I could I would score a higher score. This is my 1st review nd I don't take the time to write reviews but this place deserves my time......",

It serves four perfectly. The red sangria and El Dorado margaritas are great. I had the carnitas street tacos for dinner. They were amazing. The rice is good too. I tried my husband's chicken enchiladas and they were amazing. The rest of my party tried the carne asada burritos, beef enchiladas, and carne street tacos and really enjoyed it all. Marco is an awesome waiter and takes great care of you! We were also pleasantly surprised that Chef Paco and the general manager stopped by our table to check on us. I definitely recommend and will definitely go back!",

I love Mexican food, but really \"how do you mess up cheese enchiladas, chips and salsa?\"  The ambience was awful, no reference to the strip club next door, but the booths were uncomfortable, no other choices for seating other than the bar or high top tables.  The service cycle was terrible, the drinks were small and expensive.  I had heard very positive things about this place and was looking forward to trying it but what a huge disappointment!!!  Much hype, no delivery.  The enchiladas tasted like the red sauce was ketchup.  Ughhh!!  Save your money go to Taco Bell!!!!",

    "text": "INSANELY GOOD!!!! I literally read every review because after reading the first few, I was intrigued by what everyone had to say. Is it really possible that the vast majority of people had the same amazing experience? I had to find out, so my husband, son and I checked it out. I agree it is a little weird to walk up to a restaurant that is next to a strip club with a 3 year old, but it's Vegas and so what. The ambiance and decor is beautifully understated, welcoming and classy. The hostess was very nice and seated us right away, we were relieved to see other families with children (sometimes you don't know how truly kid-friendly some places are). Our server Kai immediately brought us water and engaged us in conversation about how we heard about them. He is very charismatic and genuinely interested in the well-being of the restaurant and what people think. He is very attentive without being intrusive and his excitement sharing in the knowledge of the menu and the process involved is very refreshing.   Fresh chips and the 3 types of salsa were a great way to start. We got there in time for happy hour, so we took advantage of the $1 street tacos and ordered 2 of each. You will not be disappointed no matter which one you order, as each is better than the next. I will say that my favorite was the Al Pastor; the combination of the salty pork and pineapple was a little bit of heaven with every bite. The carnitas were so tender, and the chicken was perfectly marinated. The tableside guac is a must, but it is a very large portion, so be prepared. The pozole was amazing and there aren't many restaurants in Vegas that serve it, so it was definitely a nice surprise! Between the non-GMO meats and fresh ingredients, you can taste real food with every dish.  Even though we were overly full, we ordered the flan (based on EVERY review). Before it came out, Chef Paco came out to talk to introduce himself and ask about our dinner. The passion he exudes about what he does, is evident in the food he creates and how he talks about it. What a talented man, that was taught by his mother and grandmother; truly wonderful to hear about his inspirations. He actually brought us the flan, and I can say without hesitation, that it was by far the best dessert I have ever had....hands down! It was a mistake not to order one to go. This is a very long review, but the experience was worth telling everyone how phenomenal this gem is! Every local needs to make this their new go-to spot. Thank you staff of El Dorado for a wonderful evening of great food and great service. We will be back and we will being our friends!!",

Place is not the cleanest, located next to strip bar in fact you think you are going into a strip bar until you get right up to the door and realize there are two entrances. We were seated in a private little room which was ok but as earlier stated not the cleanest, waiter was okay but just kind of there not talking up any particular dish or recommending any item. With the size group we had they gave us four baskets of chips which were gone in short order and when asking for more were told they cost $2.00 per basket which isn't much but I have never heard of this in a Mexican restaurant which normally gives unlimited chips. Now for the food not one person said their food was even great or even good in fact one person got extremely sick later and was unable to attend the show the next day,was it the food ? I can not say it was but several complained the next day of upset stomachs.  Bad food, bad service, bad location means I would not recommend it.",

The inside atmosphere is really nice; roomy, decorated well, and comfortable. Would have preferred to sit in the main dining room, but for whatever reason, we were seated in the back area next to a bachelorette party. Tableside guacamole was just \"ok\"- very chunky and lacking lime and cilantro.I also  found it odd that that they don't have a separate individual make the guac- each server makes it for their own tables. We had a steak bowl and 3 tacos- 2 chicken and a fish.  All dishes were flavorful and the cilantro rice that came with the tacos was delicious. Margaritas were nothing to write home about at $14 each. I would not recommend the raspberry one as it had absolutely no flavor. Dining companion liked his jalepeno margarita. Checked in with Yelp and chef brought out a complimentary flan.  Wow!  I typically don't like flan at all but this was fantastic. Nice touch that chef Jorge brought it out himself and gave us his card as well. Overall, good meal, but pricey for Mexican food.",

From the fresh pulled chicken quesadillas filled with rich spices and the most moist meat you will ever try, just melt in your mouth! The nice part apart this restaurant is it lets you experience anything from your classic home flavors, to street flavors, and of course the top shelf gourmet flavors. These traditional and modernized recipes really make me feel just like I am at home! The churros are to die for and the fried ice cream melts right in your mouth with a nice flavorful crunch to add! The atmosphere is very calm and comforting with great music and a friendly staff. I was very surprised how knowledgable the staff was as I was being educated myself throughout the experience! Chef Paco really knows how to bring True and traditional Mexico right here to Las Vegas. His menu and flavors really bring a touch of home to this cantinas kitchen! Very friendly and knows how to make your stomach a happy one! Kelsey my server with a permanent smile really helped bring the experience together with her attentive customer service skills!

    "text": "went there on a saturday night on Sept 20., the place ROCKS!!!, the interior is a classy surprise when you walk in, we actually dined at the bar.  had the Tostaditas de Tinga and Shrimp Taquitos for apps, the chicken Tostaditas may have been the best thing we ate there, delicious, moist and flavorful...the shrimp taquitos were good as well, wish there had been more sauce.  for dinner my wife has the Carne Asdada (tasty, moist and a bit zingy) and I had the Carnitas tacos, probably the least impressive thing we had, but ok nonetheless.  they surprised us with a Flan before our ordered deseret, it was AWESOME delicious, perfect consistency and accented with a bit of whipped cream on the side.  our regular dessert were the Churros, awesome!!!!! with a pleasant surprise in the middle.  the chocolate sauce was good but the caramel sauce was spectacular! do yourself a favor, get off the strip, save some money and get to this place for a dinner one evening.  thank me later!!!!",

    "text": "Where do I start...... Was looking for an organic restaurant here in Vegas. I just so happened to see a billboard on the 15N that said \"All Organic & Non-GMO Restaurant\" SOLD!!! I had to try it. We arrive at Club Sapphire haha the restaurant is next door, perfect location. Lol anyway, We walk in and the place looks fancy. Very nice setting and a helpful staff. \"table for 3 please....\" We sit down look over the menu. They bring over chips and salsa and water to start. .... We order.. My Padrino orders a Carne Asada Burrito, my brother orders the Chicken Fajitas Platter (great portion of food ) and I order the veggie salad.... The food was promptly served at record time lol we finished the chips and asked for more but it was $3.50 extra charge. No thanks. Refills are $1. Ok I guess. The food made up for both of those items... The food was delicious, so much flavor in every bite. The salad came with a plum vinaigrette dressing.... A grander word than delicious. That's how it was lol Superb!!!  To make this experience even better....... Executive Chef Paco presented us with his famous Flan, just for checking in. Mouth watering, melting in your mouth, the Flan was Perfection. The perfect amount of sweetness. We had an pleasant conversation with Executive Chef Paco, he was so kind to break it down on why he chose to go Organic and even explained to us why the food was priced the way they are. I was impressed on how well he communicated with us. He was friendly and very approachable. This made my experience here that much better. I'm definitely coming back here next time in in Vegas. I recommend everyone to do the same. You get what you pay for. All I gotta say. And I'm done lol",

    "text": "Finding the restaurant was a bit hard. It's well off the strip (in the 'shadow' of Trump tower) and it has no sign on the road side. It's entrance is directly located next to the entrance of Sapphire (the men's club). Normally I wouldn't bring myself, let alone my wife and 12 year old son, near a place like this. But around dining time (i.e. 7-8 pm) the doors of Sapphire are still closed.  We were welcomed by a very friendly hostess and were seated immediately. The wednesday evening is usually quit slow in here, but the atmosphere is good anyway.  The food was just great, as was the service. We ate the pineapple shrimp, the cedar chipotle salmon and the beef enchiladas. The latter was maybe not as special as the other two, but still very nice.  The portions were just about right. Still a bit too much for us europeans, so we didn't order desserts.  Chef Paco however thought that we have had to wait a bit too long for our meals, by their standards, so he gave us a sample of his flan. That flan really hit the spot; superb. Whatsmore he gave us two discount coupons for our next visit. Unfortunately, we didn't find the time to go there a second time.  Go there!!!!!",

Although we were seated very quickly, and were delivered water by the busboy, that was the last service we received.  We waited while the booth next to us was delivered 3 shots of tequila from admiring men (working girls from Sapphire and men who wanted to \"meet\" them).  We waited while the booth on the other side of us had a lovely conversation in Spanish with a restaurant employee.  We waited.... we waited... and we waited some more.  At 8:40 p.m. we had waited long enough.  No one ever came to take our drink order or food order.  No one.  Nada.  Zippo.  Bupkis.  When I told the hostess why we were leaving her response was a very too-bad-so-sad and ho-hum \"oh, I'll tell someone.\"  That was it.  No apology.  No concern.  Maybe if we had been wearing glamazon makeup or had our tits on display like the strippers from next door - rather than being extremely casual after a day in the 110+ heat - we would have been treated differently.  Maybe.  NO BUENO!",

My first impression was questionable, being that it's right next door to a strip club. But then I thought, hey we're in Vegas lol. The decor is nice with a large bar and big screen TV's. We decided to sit at the bar and ordered a couple margaritas. Sarah helped us. She was very friendly. I wanted mine made light, with less sugar. She was happy to do that for me and it was still very good. My husband ordered an assortment of street tacos and I ordered the combo shrimp, chicken, and steak fajitas. Everything was excellent! The cilantro rice was the best I ever had. I was trying to eat low carb but I couldn't stop eating the rice. Also the chips come with three different salsas, all very good. It was pretty cool that Mexican actor, Noel Guglielmi from Training Day and Friday was in there eating with his friends. That's a good sign that this place must be good. I would highly recommend this place:)",

I ordered the chilaquiles with green sauce. Pretty good. They marinate the chips in the sauce so the flavor is good and soaked into each bite. They also serve it with carne asada. This is where you can tell they spend the time to get better cuts of meat for their food. The carne asada was clean and not greasy. My SO got the Mahi tacos. They were pretty good but nothing spectacular. I would maybe try something else on another go around. They're running a special on the flan this month: buy 1 for $5 or try both kinds for $8. I was too full to try both so I just original. The other option is coffee. The faln is exceptional. It's kind of hilarious that this is RIGHT NEXT to Sapphire. There were surprisingly a lot of families here. Service is good. Shannon was a great server. 1 star knock for the lackluster taste. 1 more star knock for not telling us there were happy hour specials going on while we sat there.",

I ordered a Ceaser salad once the lettuce was an actual half of a Romain lettuce with the hard end, sprinkled with cold DRY chicken (I asked for hot grilled chicken, spoiled lettuce with bruised sides, and croutons I couldn't even bite through. I ate nothing. Paid for it. Drank my tap water and left. Ordered steak once that tasted like it had Z-up Lucus on it.

I will always vouch for their pozole. They have pretty good fajitas and steak bowls.   Service on the other hand. Management needs to step up their scheduling game. Having 2 servers handle a restaurant during the lunch rush hour is really retarded. You had the bartender serving tables as well which led to the servers making their own drinks. Having our food show up before our drinks and waiting over 10 mins for chips and salsa is just awful. Server was nice and apologetic but that can only get you far.  Please work on this, I'd really love to give you another star...",

I had the Carnitas Rojas Burrito. My wife had the Carne asada street tacos and my son tried the beef taquitos. By our third bites we were planning on what to eat on our next visit. Next time we'll come as a couple minus the minor and focus on cocktails too. The Assistant GM, Sean, checked on us to make sure everything was ok, and it was. We'll be back and this will be the spot where we bring our out of towners.   Snap, just found out that Mondays are for locals. I guess we'll have to come back on Monday.   My son also noticed  the wait time on food was awesome and it was. My wife can be picky when trying new places, but she was all smiles   Chef Paco stopped by our table and talked about how we were about to eat his grandmother's flan recipe. Top shelf.  Don't want to forget our server.  Very attentive while training another server. She rocked the table side guac. Thank you Amber.",

The al pastor street tacos were phenomenal as were our other dishes (chicken sopas, cactus tacos). The drinks are definitely something to brag about. The house margarita was amazing, but you can't go wrong with the jalapeno margarita! Also, I highly recommend the flan for dessert. It has a wonderfully creamy consistency and has the perfect amount of after-dinner sweetness. I wish I could give this place 5+ stars because it really is that good.

The temptation to turn around and eat somewhere else was high when we rolled up and saw it was attached to Sapphire Gentlemen's club - we are so glad we stayed.   This review is 4.5 stars.   The food is incredible, very authentic and flavorful. The three complementary salsas that come with the chips are just a pre-indicator of the delicious food to come. Our waitress, Tiffany, was very sweet and knowledgable about the menu. She gave some great suggestions and made some killer table-side guac.   All in all, really great experience. Highly recommend for a good treat off the strip. We will definitely be back. The menu also boasts that it is all non-GMO and mostly organic ingredients, and the prices were super reasonable taking that into consideration with the fact that it's Vegas.",

The fact that this place made the list makes sense once you know it's next door to a gentlemen's club. Clearly, the best tacos are next door at sapphire. Flavorless beans, flavorless meat and not a drop of hot sauce available. Save your money and go to Taco and Beer.",

The bar tender gave me a free drink for the few minutes we sat at the bar waiting on a table to open up.  2. I went with two friends. Their food was brought out in reasonable timing. My food was brought out so much later that they were both finished eating. The waiter stopped by a few times, he was definitely very busy. But never let me know they were understaffed in the kitchen or to just give me a heads up he hadn't forgotten. Just after we asked for the check, someone finally brought my food out.  The food was definitely 5 stars, as everyone else seems to agree.  My particular experience was a 3.",

    "text": "I've been here a lot so this review is overdue. El Dorado is a nice restaurant that uses high quality ingredients to make good food. It is in a conspicuous location right next to a very large gentleman's club, but don't let that deter you if, for some reason, that's an issue. It is conveniently open 24 hours a day and has discounted food and drinks during normal and reverse HH. Locals get a discount (I think it's 20%) off their entire bill on Mondays. You also get a free dessert (either flan or tres leches or orange ice cream) if you check in on Yelp. My favorite dish is the signature bowl with chicken, but in general  the restaurant uses ingredients that are non-gmo, organic, and some are locally sourced. The prices, however, are a little on the high side. For example, the signature bowl, which is a large portion of food, is around $18. The reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the service is hit or miss, even when the place is pretty empty. You would expect it to be a little better given the prices people are paying for the food.  Nevertheless, the quality of the meals along with the convenience factor is enough to overcome spotty service and the relatively high prices.",

    "text": "On a recent trip to Vegas, I checked this place out. First, don't be fooled by the bad reviews about it being attached to a strip club! Yes, you will see the people going into the strip club. Yes, you will see some of the club bouncers. No, they don't share a kitchen. If you don't want to, you never have to enter the strip club! Get over it! It's in Vegas!  When I went in, I immediately sat down at the bar. Tiffany was my waitress/bartender. I got a sampler with Imperial Shrimp (seafood stuffed shrimp wrapped in bacon), Tostaditas de Tinga, and Empanadas. Also got a plate of al pastor tacos and a side of the ghost chili salsa. Finished with the churros. Had a couple of beers with all of this and a jalapeno margarita.  Everything was...AMAZING! First, I don't like shrimp. I don't hate them, but I don't like them. The flavor of the shrimp with the bacon was amazing! The texture was perfect and they were perfectly cooked. The tostadas and empanadas were the perfect size, and everything tasted extremely fresh. They weren't overly seasoned and they went perfectly with the Double IPA I had. The tacos were also perfectly prepared with just enough of every topping that you didn't feel overwhelmed by anything. I ended up putting the ghost chili salsa on the tacos because the flavor was the perfect compliment to to the tacos.  While waiting for the churros, I had the jalapeno margarita. It had the perfect amount of kick while not being overly sweet. The spicy flavors with the salt and the tangy lime made it blend really well.  Finally, the churros. Ohhhhhhh...the churros. I can't say enough about them! They are stuffed with apple and are AWESOME!!! Wow! If you go here for nothing else, then get the churros!   All of this comes together with an amazing staff. Chef Paco makes some killer food and is extremely funny and nice! He comes around to everyone to check on them, talk about the food, and just generally seems to love to have a good time! Tiffany was also AMAZING! She made the salsa in front of me and also made the margarita.  I have made this a regular spot every trip I go to Vegas. Food is always top notch and the staff is amazing!",

The place is open 24/7 which is convenient after a long night next store and the interior decor is upscale and impressive.   For starters, I received chips and three types of salsa which ranged from habanera hot to mild. My friendly waitress suggested the pozole or chicken enchiladas and I took her up on the pozole. The pozole pork was lean and wonderful tasting. It came with tortilla chips - which I  broke up & threw in the soup which was an added treat. I was pretty full but ordered the flan which was bomb dessert!  I would highly suggest El Dorado grill for a business meeting or intimate dinner. BTW they also offer local specials and happpy hour here, so definitely check them out!",

The burrito contained nice tender and lean chunks of carnitas and filled with cilantro rice. Very tasty. I am a huge fan of spicy food and always seek the hottest I can find. Many places brag about spicy and most never are. Tonight I met my match! This stuff was out of this world hot, but it also had such a wonderful flavor with the additional spices added. Trust me!

Chef Paco came out and asked about our food and made sure we were informed the the great quality. I suggest ordering a house margarita. I might have drank mine a bit fast!    My update for 10/19.. service from Enrique was awesome! He made sure that everyone in our party was well taken care of. I still suggest their traditional margaritas!   12/19 we had Enrique yet again as a waiter..I'm still convinced we have the best waiter alive.  We love his positivity and attitude.. great suggestion on al pastor and the carnitas.",

I've never been wow'd by the service here besides with a server i personally know. Tonight was my final straw at El Dorado Cantina. Decio had by far the worst service I've ever been given not to mention I am in the service industry so I know what is expected. He took our order and after that we had to track him down once we were already done with our meal to ask for refills and dessert menu. He told us our childrens meals have free desserts and will be out with in 3 min. After waiting about 8 min and still no sign of him he decided to just leave. The food was ok. Not the best I've ever had here. We were seated in the very back of the restaurant where nobody was at when there were plenty of tables in the main dining room. Over all I am so disappointed in this entire experience.",

    "text": "8 of us gathered here for lunch yesterday.  For starters, we ordered two quesoin fundidos, one with mushrooms and the other with chorizo.  We also got an ordered of garlic lime fried chapulines (grasshoppers).  With the quesos, we were brought both corn and flour tortillas.    For the main part of lunch, we got their Grande feast plate which the menu says serves 10-12.  The grande feast consists of two feast plates--the pequeno which serves 3-4 people and the mediano which serves 6-8 people.  The pequeno consists of steak, carnitas & chicken burritos, pulled chicken or cheese quesadillas and beef & chicken taquitos.  The mediano platter consists of Sliced carne asada, grilled chicken, grilled shrimp & chorizo with queso fresco, cactus, grilled onions & chiles.    There was more than enough for these hungry eaters.  carne asada, grilled chicken, and grilled shrimp of the mediano were very well cooked and seasoned quite well.  I had some of a chicken burrito from the pequeno platter and it was well prepared.  The chapulines were good put a bit pricey at $12.    For dessert, we got three complimentary flans (one for each Yelp check in) and we got one order of tres leches cake.  The flan was standard.  I really enjoyed the tres leches cake.  Too bad we had to share!  While we were eating, the General Manager, Christian Umlauf, visited our table and talked with us about the restaurant and was very genial and a gracious host.  Shortly after, Chef Paco, the executive chef, came to the table and brought a bag of spicy nuts that his mother sends him from Mexico City.  He shared a good part of the bag with us in a styrofoam cup.  A very pleasant man who explained some of the dishes.  Jesse was our server and he did an outstanding job!  He kept water glasses filled, brought more tortillas as needed, and was always available when we had a equation.  El Dorado has been on my radar since Yelp had an event there and I was unable to attend because of a conflict.  I will be going back to try some of their signature items.  The restaurant is very nicely appointed.",

I think it's my new favorite place.   Cheese enchiladas, shrimp fajitas, chicken fienstien and shrimp tacos all great portions and high on quality and high on flavor.   The flan was amazing and the tres leches and fried ice cream were also pretty darn good.   So why only 3 stars? The server/service  is part of the atmosphere and can make or break a dining experience.   Jessie our server was cold and impersonal. I have never had a server appear to be so disinterested. I am hoping he was just having an off day and that he is normally as  upbeat and helpful as the restaurants other servers.  He's attitude and demeanor greatly diminished our experience.    At the end of the meal he actually had another server bring us out check. Interesting ... and not in a good way.   I would absolutely return and highly recommend this place if you want excellent food in an upscale and relaxed atmosphere.",

For the high prices, it was just ok. 3 stars is because it's organic. but here's the rub. Veggie tacos got wet and flimsy. I might as well had served myself because I was like \"where's waldo?\" looking for my server LOL. It's cute if you are going with a crowd of swinger friends to the strip club RIGHT  next door.  Mexican food is good with a little booty ha ha ha.",

They have more employees than clients, and took 20min to bring out diet coke. Also, the 3 bartenders made our drinks and they sat on their counter for 20 min until we had to ask the manager would anyone mind bringing us our drinks that have been melting... no exaggeration, they have more employees than customers. 3 bartenders made our 3 drinks and not one could walk the drinks 4ft to our table. What a terrible experience.  As for the bill, if you get a margarita Cadillac style, they charge you for a margarita, and then they add $5.00 for \"Cadillac\" stlye..  that's a definite first.   Overall, very over priced, food is decent, but for the lack of service and the prices this place is kind of a joke. It explains why there's more servers that don't really serve than there was customers...",

We had queso fundido  with mushrooms, so perfected seasoned and accentuated with fresh herbs n veggies. I wanted to try the veggie tacos, but the one drawback was the chef refused to make them without celery for me. So, upon our exceptional bartender, Greg's, recommendation I got the Mahi tacos. So delicious and fresh.  I'm super-picky about seafood and this is tops!  The mango margaritas were on point and half- off for locals on Monday made the slightly - high but totally worth it for the quality so easy to bear. Another drink, please;)",

    "text": "Came here the other night with my girlfriend with high expectations...we both left highly disappointed.  Location is what makes this place highly attractive and interesting. Located next to Sapphire Strip Club. They literally share a wall with the joint. Genius location by the owner. The foot traffic that this place will bring nightly is unreal.  I wasn't the biggest fan of the ambiance nor decor of the place. TV's were strangely placed, making for an awkward view.   Service: Service was terrible! We were seated at the bar until a table became available. No problem, we didn't have to wait long for one to open up. However, once we sat down at the table, no one came to serve us or ask for our order! We waited 15 minutes, then we asked a server if he could find us our waiter. After waiting another 10 minutes still with no one showing up. I asked another server if they could find our waiter. Finally someone came 10 minutes after that.  Food: Honestly, it was pretty forgettable. And pricey for what you get.   We ordered:  Red Sangria - Ok  Guacamole - they forgot to put salt or spices in it - so it tasted very bland. Like I was basically just eating an avocado. Disappointing   Shrimp Taquitos - Good  Chicken Quesadilla - Good  Chicken Enchilada - Ok  Mahi Tacos - Really good  Carne Asada, al pastor, carnitas - ok  Churros - Bomb!  Overall: Overpriced, service was awful, and the food was just ok. I've had way better Mexican in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "When visiting Vegas, there are a lot of reasons to stay on the strip.  El Dorado is a good reason to...adventure.  One of my pre-Vegas checklist items was \"I want great Mexican food\" - and while there were plenty of options that didn't require a cab, the reviews and pictures of this place pretty much spoke for themselves.  After several hours of thrill riding on top of the Stratosphere, we took a cab over to El Dorado.  (Yes, way closer than taking it from the Delano, we purposely planned it this way.)  First off - check in on Yelp.  I stress this only because El Dorado grants you a free flan.  You may think..yeah, i'm not much of a fan of flan...but this is different.  I'll get to that, trust me.  The chips and salsa pretty much followed us to the table - and when they say \"that salsa (pointing at one bowl) is hot\" they really do mean it.  Hot hot hot, but very good.  The others were much less \"my mouth is on fire\" and went pretty quickly.  Thirsty?  Yes.  Good thing the house margaritas are phenomenal - and big enough to last most of the meal.  Highly recommended.  Sip one, down one and sip one, down two and sip one...it all depends on how you plan on getting home.  ....Cab.  Don't blink an eye when contemplating the tableside guacamole - get it and eat it all.  Definitely in the top 5 \"tableside guacamole experiences\" i've ever had.  While there were plenty of tempting options on the menu, we wanted to try as many things as possible.  We ordered fish tacos immediately, and got four kinds of street tacos as well.   All.  Were.  Awesome.  You can close your eyes and just point at a bunch of stuff, you'll be happy with whatever comes.  Now you are full - but don't forget about that flan, which leads to a conversation about Chef Paco.  The epitome of a chef that cares about the food he makes, he came out to say hi and to make sure we enjoyed everything we ate.  That's when we found out that the flan is his grandmother's recipe, homemade on the daily.  Off the charts authentic - and absolutely delicious.    Annnnd I'm all about good churros, so, of course, I had to order those too.  These guys had some weight to them and were also absolutely delicious.  Between the food, drinks, and two desserts...we were full for the rest of the day.  Everything here is organic, non-GMO, and fantastic.  Paco really cares about the food he prepares, and this is absolutely worth the trip.    Oh, and did I mention it's open 24 hours?  WHAT?!?    Next time we are in Vegas - we will 100% be back.  I wish I was there now, because I haven't had dinner yet and I...cannot eat the words I just typed.",

    "text": "Wow! This place is a Vegas must! The food is amazing, we came here based on the other rave reviews and those good reviews are spot on! I had the house salad which is more than just a house salad, my hot date had the three taco platter, the shredded chicken is delicious, the pulled pork is good but a bit greasy, and the carne asada was yummy too (he said). Now for the chips and salsa chips are thin which I like, but are slightly to greasy for me, but nowhere near as bad as I have had at other restaurants. The salsa is fabulous, they bring two and if you want to try the habanero one you'll  have to request it, that one was not my favorite but my hot date loved it. The staff is exquisite Joaquinn was our server and he is great, we also got a visit from the manager, and Paco the chef when he served us his famous flan. Now for the flan, I have never been a fan of flan but this one has got me giddy for more (only from here!) **HUGE PLUS**They are non GMO, organic and have many gluten free options... Oh and they are open 24/7 THE END. Update 01/23/18 once again this place did not disappoint, chicken burrito was so good and the table side guacamole is a must! Also ask for Juan he is an awesome server!",

The meatballs in the albondigas soup were very dry, the Mexican corn wasn't juicy, the cheese enchiladas arrived cold, and the fajitas certainly weren't worth the price.   Dining room was much too dark for my taste, and I could barely see the food, let alone read the menu.   On the upside, Yelp provided a free dessert upon check in. However, just not enough to keep it on my list of staples.",

The world is finally waking up and learning about the negative impacts of GMOs on our health, so hopefully we'll see more examples like this great restaurant.  Until then, frequent them as much as possible to vote with your dollars.    First went to El Dorado Cantina in 2014 during their soft opening days.  Although we don't live in Las Vegas, we came so regularly when we visited that we got to know Chef Paco and learn how important that quality of the food served is to the owners and workers here.  It was a huge win for me because food quality and non-GMO, organic food is very important to me and should be for everyone.  In 2015 I became vegan and the vegan offerings here were limited so we stopped coming.  I learned on social media that they started offering gluten free and vegan options, so we came back and have fallen in love all over again with this place.  Vegan, gluten free and vegetarian options are clearly noted on the menu.  They also have the best Margaritas in all of Las Vegas!",

Usually you go to any place and order it, eat and it does it's job but here? It was incredible! The dressing, to quality of the produce. Loved it! Then the main course! I can't rave enough about this places food.   My favorite part though is the staff. It's obvious how much they all care about and love their craft. Jeff in particular provided great service!",

Carne Asada street tacos were delish!! The flan, a generational recipe was the best I've ever had, seriously. Thank you to Camille, our server for being such a great person!! She was the best, her suggestions were spot on and her table side guacamole was to die for!!",

I started out with the Queso Fundido which was all i anticipated and then some. asked the bartender which tacos to get and i was not steered wrong. I chose one taco myself which wasnt recommended and i see why. Rajas con queso just sucked. Bland and barely any queso at all. The pork with habenero pickled onions was my favorite. The hot sauce trio for dipping was some of the best salsa i had. It gave you 3 levels of heat. My favorite being the organge habenero salsa. I see why this place has all the stars. they deserve it. Decor is very nice also.",

Unfortunately my husband had given the card but I realized too late he charged us for all adult plates. Then he asked if we'd be in town a few days and said we will be. Gave us two free sodas as if that would make up for it. Our bill was a little over $100 dollars for two adults and two children. My girls are tiny. Can't justify his charge.

Not busy at all.  Only complaints. 1. Wait for more chips, the lady that made our guacamole totally forgot she told us she was going to grab us more chips. There was a wait for us to box up our unfinished meals & a wait to order our dessert. Now it's during happy hour 1-3 am and we are now waiting for our Check since the one server they have is busy waiting tables. We've been here about 2 hours total.   My go to bottled Evian water available in a fancy glass Bottle!  Table side guacamole was fresh and tasty with just the right amount of spice. Chips were freshly fried & crispy.  I enjoyed my classic margarita with tajin rim.   Cochinita plate. Pork was flavorful and served atop banana leaves.I enjoyed putting whatever amount of meat & pickled something into my corn tortilla that arrived in a tortilla warmer. Lime rice shaped like a star reminded me of the chipotle rice.  My hubby ordered the red beef enchilada s plate  3/5.  Fried ice cream & paco grandmas flan was the highlight of our experience here.   Con-located next door to sapphire strip club. But so is everything else in Vegas lol  Our bill 120.00 total. We ordered 2 beers. 5 & 7 bucks. Classic margarita. 12.00. Guacamole 16.00. Cochinita plate 25.00. Red beef enchilada plate. 20.00 Evian water 8.00. Flan 8.00. Fried ice cream, 10.00.  I left my wallet here accidentally and returned the next day to pick it up! Nothing was missing & I had cash in my wallet.",

My friend and I were craving Mexican food and it was clear on Yelp that this was the place to go! We had an amazing experience.   The food was fantastic. The drinks were great. But I think stood out to us most was the customer service / hospitality of the staff. Everyone was so welcoming and made the overall experience extra special. Taylor was an outstanding bartender that made great recommendations and made everyone feel well taken care of! I was impressed he even made our guacamole from scratch! It's impressive at the bar watching the staff handle so much with ease.   I def recommend this restaurant.   On a separate note, don't be too confused when you get to this location and see it's next to a gentleman's club. My friend and I were surprised, along with other strangers outside of the door lol. But seriously, don't let the location keep you from going in. I saw some people almost back out which would of been a shame! It's separated from the other establishment would be a shame for you to miss out on an amazing experience from ambience, food and company! :)  So yes - get yourself in here and enjoy!",

I love mole, don't always love meat in general but the flank steak was cooked perfectly and compliments the rest of the flavors and textures to create an incredible dish tonight... yummmmm!!!!!  As sides it came with rice and beans, for which I opted for black. Only had the1/2 my enchalada and will look forward to eating this for a couple days lol. Portions were good because even my husband slowed down on his towards the end of his carne asada wet burrito with the same sides. He'd give his a 4.5/5 but I'm 5/5 on mine. So delicious! It's also after 1am so to find such quality food at any time of day/night is such a gem :)   They also treated us to the flan dessert which was a total surprise and my husband dropped the spoon and kind of drooped down from the deliciousness which was very amusing so I'm psyched to try it haha but it looks delicious and I'm going to get to it. Overall everyone here was pleasant, our server was Stella and we'll be back when we're back in the Vegas area in the future and recommend it!   Tip: its separate from the strip club called Sapphire or Sapphire's (?) but only by a very sturdy/luckily sound-proof wall because we thought we were lost when we arrived in the parking lot and saw the \"gentleman's club\" sign and crowd haha. They're door is close to the entrance to that, just to the left. Whether you're in to that crowd or not I suggest you give this restaurant a try and know you're actually in the correct place when you follow GPS directions haha. Surprisingly the crowd in here was quiet and.... Not hyped up like the crowd next door which helped this pleasant, friendly atmosphere separate from next door haha (not that I'm against it for that but just to share in case people have doubts about coming).",

Next time I would split it with someone.  The pork was delicious and soft and it went all so well with the garlic fried rice.  Quite the find and made with organic ingredients.  Most of all...the leche flan was the best ever....had me thinking of my Filipino aunties' flans of the past growing up.  Soooooo good.  The service was great..had Shawn helping us through the menu and he guided us well.  Would I come back?  Yup yup yup...every time.",

We were a little skeptical because they shared a building with a strip club, but we were went ahead and tried it anyways. Besides, one of the best restaurants we've been to in Vegas used to be in a very sketchy neighborhood.  We're definitely glad we came in. Service was friendly and the food was really good! I ordered the Carne Asada Burrito enchilada style (they call it wet here) and it was served with Cilantro Lime Rice. I really liked the rice. The burrito was good, I just wished it had more sauce though. My wife ordered the Mole Enchiladas with steak instead of chicken and she absolutely loved it. For dessert we got the Flan and it really hit the spot. So delicious! We will definitely come back here again when we want Mexican food and we're in Vegas.",

    "text": "After finding out that \"Bandito's Latin Kitchen\" had closed, I was in the mood for some Mexican food. We looked at some options and \"El Dorado Cantina\" popped in our search.      The Place: The restaurant is off the strip, next to a Gentleman's Club. The outside of the place make you think it is not going to be that pretty, but you will be surprised how cute it is inside! Red decorated walls, dark furniture, and lamps hanged from the roof.  They have counter high tables and seats, booths, and bar seating. We were a party of 3 and sat in a roomy booth.   The Food: The restaurant is open 24 hours and they feature Mexican food and tapas; they have breakfast available too! I was happy to see \"empanadas\" in the menu. We ordered tableside guacamole and some beef empanadas as an appetizer. We also got some drinks: I had the \"Amazon\" margarita with pomegranate juice and sugar rim. Later, I had a \"Las Sirenas\" cocktail and I thought it was better.   For main courses, we had tacos al pastor, Cochinita Chile Relleno, and chicken enchiladas. I liked the tacos; they were flavorful! I loved their rice; they serve white instead of yellow rice.  For dessert, we had churros and fried ice cream! Yummy!   The Service:  The service was great! Jessica took good care of us during dinner time. I could notice they were a little understaff: as more people came in, the tableside guacamole and desserts took longer.   Overall, a nice place for dinner at reasonable prices. Yes, I would come back.",

We were seated immediately on a Saturday night, without reservations. I ordered the shrimp enchiladas with green sauce. It came with cilantro, white rice, and black beans. The first round of chips and salsa were also complimentary. My husband ordered the carne asada burrito, which was super filling. Everything tasted delicious and was reasonably priced. Our total came up to about $35 with tax and tip.   The restaurant shares its parking lot with a strip club, so depending on which night you go, parking may be a bit of a hassle.",

Yes it's next to a strip club and off the Vegas strip but I promise you this is so worth the trip here.   Jess our server was amazingggg!!! She is such a sweetheart and was so pleasant to deal with. She offered us some great recommendations and when we had one minor issue she was quick to correct it.    Now to the food...Corn get the corn and get it on the cob gawd damn it was seasoned and tasted amazingggg!!  The chips and salsa were good and complimentary. I ordered the chicken fajitas, my Husband ordered the steak and shrimp. They were both seriously out of this world delicious. So flavorful and juicy. Not dry at all and the best part is that the veggies were cooked to perfection they were not too hard and were actually sauteed nicely.  I highly recommend this place. Service on point, food on point and this is my go to spot when staying in Vegas.",

When we got there around 3pm we were the third group of people in here. Then afterwards, people started coming in and half the place was packed. So I guess it must be pretty busy throughout the day.   We started with the Caesar Salad ($14). Instead of chop romaine lettuce, it comes out in spears so it's cut lengthwise. It has fresh queso fresco and toasted pepitas tossed with their fresh house made Caesar dressing.   Street tacos with carne asada ($14.50). The steak was so tender. It had cilantro, onion and was supposed to have guacamole but I didn't see nor taste any. It came with lime wedges which we squirted  it on the tacos and it sure made every bite pop with flavor. This is one of the top street tacos that I have ever tasted. It reminded myself of the time I was in Mexico.  Side note it comes with double flour tortilla and lots of steak so you can actually make smaller tacos.  For $4 more you add cilantro rice and choice of refried or black beans.   For all you vegetarians you can try the Chile Relleno ($15) as it was perfectly made. It is stuffed with roasted poblano pepper and a three cheese blend and topped with tomato sauce. It came with cilantro rice and you have a choice of refried or black beans.   Everything everyone had was a wow moment. All you heard was oh and ah. At the end everyone's plates was empty.  I really wanted to try the refried ice cream but I was too full. Is that even a possibility?  I hate to say it but I was too full. This is a must do for Mexican food for sure.",

    "text": "Wow.  At a first glance, it feels like you're about to eat tacos at a strip club.  But then, you eat said tacos and they're AMAZING, but yes, sadly, you are at a strip club, but only next door so it's cool.  And hey, it's Vegas baby!  I tried the carnitas, al pastors, asadas and chorizos... and DAMN.  There are a couple local Mexican restaurant in Buffalo that sling great tacos, and another in my \"second home\" in Southeast Georgia, but El Dorado has bested them all in my tongue's point-of-view, and if my tongue could talk, it would tell you it has tasted A LOT of tacos.  Now is the point when I pick out something to say negatively to put my review in perspective.... The choice to have lime rice served in lieu of Mexican rice will fall into the realms of legend.  Hmm, didn't work out the way I would have liked that one, but that rice, like the tacos here is amazing.  Did I mention that Yelp listed El Dorado Cantina one of the top 5 Mexican restaurants two years in a row?  Anyone that writes/reads a review on Yelp is obviously awesome, and they're impeccable taste shan't be trifled with.",

I love flan and get it everywhere I can and this one was amazing. Creamy and thick custard (not jell-o like some places I've been). The staff have been really friendly and attentive.   Our waiter was Chris and he was really nice and told us his recommendations and checked on us often. Executive Chef Paco came out to our table to introduce himself and ask how everything was which I think says so much about him and this restaurant.  Great place! 3rd time here and will definitely be back!",

The salsas were completely different from other restaurants. It was if I was eating a home cooked meal. We ordered a variety of tacos and was not disappointed. The portion was so generous I feel as if I got way beyond my moneys worth. After eating the appetizers my boyfriend and I were convinced we were on a show on the food network channel. The staff was very welcoming and the chef himself came to check if we needed anything else. Definitely my new hangout...I loved it!!",

I have been disappointed in the quality of Mexican restaurants that we have in Las Vegas. Usually if you want good Mexican food, you have to go to California.   This restaurant takes the cake. Probably one of the best Mexican restaurants in Vegas.   We ordered the table side guacamole, carne asada and carnitas street tacos, chicken enchilada,  and deep fried ice cream.   Wow. Foodgasm heaven! I still am thinking about the ice cream... lol.   Everything was fresh, had enough kick to it, and tons of flavor.   The ambience was amazing. A cool Gothic Spanish feel with a modern twist.   Service was great as well.   The only negative is that it's next to a strip club. But for all the parents the strip club is not connected. Also the rice lacks flavor and needs more like and salt added to it.   We will definitely be back!",

Any good reviews of this place might also be coming from intoxicated patrons next door. If you are going here for good fresh Mexican food, you will be disappointed. The food is terrible! I ordered the tacos al pastore. The meat was dry and very salty i could not eat it. The black beans, also very salty. The beef enchilada my husband had was terrible. The soup was just ok. We ordered a fruit bowl that was just watermelon, cantaloupe and pineapple for $15.00! You can have Mexican food at Cardenas, 100 times better for less than half the price.",

We met the chef and he was very nice and told us about the locals special and happy hours.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because we were seated next to a dog.  I hate when restaurants allow dogs (it was a pug not a service animal). 2nd the food runners went to 3 different tables to drop off food.  Other than that the quality and flavor of the food was outstanding.",

Being new to the neighborhood, I asked my local bartender where I needed to satiate. Regionally, this is still technically the southwest, so good Mexican food is readily available. However, it's hard to find good sopes. If you don't know what that is, google it. Good food, good drink (and I don't usually drink margaritas).",

We were not disappointed.  The food was top notch and the staff is super friendly!  Our server was Annabelle and she was super friendly, professional, and took care of us until we left!  Many thanks!  We also met Jesse (manager) and he was super cool and made sure we were well taken cared of.  Melanie (the GM) also swung by our table to make sure everything was in order.  Chef Paco also came out and greeted us!  The flan is his grandmother's recipe and it was so creamy and delicious and I definitely recommend it to finish off your meal.  No matter what you order, you will not be disappointed.  On top of that, everything is organic!  I'm definitely coming back when I go back to Vegas!",

However the garlic shrimp was bomb, I love the beans here also.  I had the fried chicken I forgot the name, it was good however if it came with sauce it would be better so I added there chipotle cream which made it right.  Taquitos and imperial shrimp apps are delicious.  You have to order the lemonade agua fresco, so bomb I had about 5 glasses.  I'm not a big Sangria drinker but even that was tasty. Desert the churros are so good, they come with a little cream filling and a banana foster sauce to dip them in.  Flan has a cheesecake like consistency which I like, because I don't care for traditional Flan and the eggy taste.  I will definitely go back. So many good dishes and Chef Paco can custom make dishes to your taste.        Some dishes are $25 and I think they could be a little cheaper however on average dishes are $10-$17. Its good for groups and even coming in by yourself has a nice open layout and friendly staff.  If you come to Vegas for Mexican food near the strip or just good flavors, try it.",

The best part about it is that it's in a strip club -- keeps all the super-pretentious squares away. It does have a separate entrance, so you don't actually have to go in the strip club...but you still have to park under the electric blue neon glare of the Sapphire signage, among all the strippers, bros and pervs. Not a big deal, tho!   The second best part is the food -- I had carne asada tacos, and they were OUT OF THIS WORLD! The black beans and rice that came with them were also EXCEPTIONALLY delicious -- they had a delicate flavor to them that I can't even describe, but I could have eaten  10 plates of each :-) I also had a house margarita, which was basically like any other margarita...only presumably GMO and organic, blah blah blah.  Prices are a little high -- for my 3 tacos it was around $15. But I don't mind paying a premium for bad ass food, which this is! Service was OK -- everyone was friendly and helpful, but our waitress did fudge my friend's order twice. (Minor stuff, and my friend did not even bring it up, so no harm no foul.)  I'm only docking one star because of the chip situation. They bring you a basket of chips and some salsa when you are seated, but then the waitress gives this weird legal disclaimer-type spiel about how the first basket is on the house, but additional baskets are $3.50 each or something like that. I thought that was kinda miserly -- for $5 a taco, ya can't throw in some friggin' tortilla chips? The fact that they announce this at the very beginning of your experience kinda creates an awkward vibe.  Other than that, a GREAT place and I will be back for sure!!",

The atmosphere is dark, tv playing video of loud Mexican singing makes it hard to have a conversation, and seating was not the most comfortable with high table and low seating. We had a group of 11 and our servers were initially attentive, taking our drink orders. We ordered 3 nacho plates for the group but found 2 of them to have what seemed like plastic pieces in them. This was brought to the attention of our server and then a manager. The server came back from the kitchen and told us it was hard unmelted cheese, not plastic. The next piece was then brought to the manager and initially she said it was plastic but after talking with the kitchen, changed her mind and said it was hard cheese. In either case this was not edible and if consumed would have been harmful. No apologies from them. The dinner entrees were huge and tasty, no issues here. My problem is with the lack of concern and attention given by the staff and management with a food issue. They charged us for the nachos despite knowing there was a problem. No way do you ever treat your customers like this. We won't be back and I wouldn't recommend you dine here with so many other choices for good Mexican food.",

But the flan, ohhhhh the FLAN! Do not leave without having it. Even if you're not sure whether you even like flan, you must have it! Also, the customer service was so impressive. Paco, the chef, brought us our dessert personally and Eric was very kind and knowledgable. Ambiance was really nice. I will definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas.",

Our favorite was the Chipotle Chicken. GREAT service and the manager Martine even checked on us twice to be sure. Place is busy right now for Sunday dinner with a neat mix of patrons, including families with kids. Don't let the location scare you (adjacent to Sapphire) as there is easy access parking in a very convenient location. Finishing with the flan. DELICIOUS!!",

Our server Erica was really accommodating and super nice, very informative too. Thanks again!   Will definitely be coming back to go more adventurous with my menu selection. There are so many interesting choices I need to sample.   Great look inside, love the booths, super comfortable and slick.

    "text": "I've been wanting to go to this place for a while because I try to eat mostly organic and I absolutely love Mexican food! I've eating at over 100 Mexican restaurants and have had many Mexican friends families' cooking. This is said to be the best and most authentic Mexican food in town, but A. I wouldn't be surprised if the chef/cooks aren't Mexican B. Although they claim to be organic it is not good. Chillis is 10 times better and it's a chain restaurant (which I don't generally like chain restaurants). The only thing I liked was the salsa verde, but I wouldn't say it was authentic lol.  The service was also horrible and the place wasn't even busy. We got there and I ordered a water and my girl ordered a juice. They brought us chips and salsa. The chips were mediocre and the like I said I liked the salsa verde. I drink a lot of water but the only time my water and I finished my glass before the food came out but I only received more water after the bill came and we were leaving. My girl doesn't eat a lot in the evening for some reason and we ordered chicken and shrimp fajitas($28/1 before tax) together to share which came out fairly quick. Usually fajitas are full of flavor but these were bland. The tortillas were no good. The guacamole was not impressive, the black beans weren't good and I love guacamole and black beans! The server seemed nice at first and spoke to us in another language which we spoke fluently too, as well as English fluently. They brought out two plates of fajitas and dropped them off quickly, said they'll bring plates for us to eat on and ran off and I didn't see our server until we nearly done eating. At first I thought oh that was nice of them to split the order which some real Mexican restaurants have done, but then we realized it was a lot of food and we realized they brought us two orders of the exact same thing. We just ate one of the plates until our server came so we could let her know that we only ordered and wanted one order of fajitas. She didn't come check on us until we were almost done. They never brought plates, filled water, asked if everything was ok, asked if we needed anything, etc. and it wasn't even busy. When we were almost done our server came and we nicely let her know that we just ordered one order of fajitas like we said initially. She started yelling and arguing, saying we are wrong and basically calling us liars saying that we said 2 which we never said the word two at all. She said, no you ordered two. Then she's like I'll get you a box and you can take it to go, at this point I'm thinking I don't even want it, but ok maybe she'll be nice and civil and take it off the check. She boxes it up and then comes back with the check and I thinking positively, since she made a mistake it would only make sense to nicely correct it on the check at least. Sadly she didn't, so I said again that we only ordered one plate of fajitas and she yelled and argued (illogically) with us although we didn't want to make a scene she had no problem making a scene. She said that she was also the manager last night. This is by far the most negative review I've ever written. My girl and I are pretty positive people and although we were unhappy and upset, we joked about it the rest of the night. Needless to say I will tell everyone to not go here and I was expecting the opposite especially since there aren't many organic restaurants in town besides maybe the Fremont area. Save yourself and don't go here, it's a waste of time and you can find much better places.",

The food is fresh, delicious, and made from scratch; the service made you feel like part of the family; and despite the unprepossessing location (in an industrial area next to a gentleman's club), the ambiance inside is relaxed and comfortable.  I grew up in AZ and live in SoCal, so I'm pretty particular about quality Mexican food, and this is absolutely first rate.  From the friendly hostess Martine, to server par excellence Enrique, to chef Paco, the staff could not have been more welcoming and pleasant.  The delightful soaps were a tasty start to the meal.  I don't eat beef, so a substitution was quickly offered for my chilaquile plate (just trust me, they're amazing).  The chips and salsa were fresh; the margaritas were delicious, and the surprise ending of flan made with chef Paco's family recipe pushed it right over the top.  I may be in a food coma for the remainder of my Vegas visit, but I do plan to return this week.  Do not miss the opportunity to dine here if you're in town!",

The food is non-gmo, organic, and majority gluten free. I had the steak, chicken, shrimp fajitas, my wife had street taco's and daughter had tostadas. Yelp reviews are right on. The food was excellent and our server, Enrique, top shelf. The food was seasoned exceptionally well. I didn't know rice could taste so delicious. The Executive Chef, Paco, made a visit to our table twice as did the manager. I love a restaurant that understands the importance of locals. There was no rush to place the bill in front of us halfway through our meal like so many other eateries. The Flan, an unexpected treat from the Executive Chef, was excellent. As a person with Celiac disease is often afraid to try a new restaurant, or any for that matter, I was confident that my meal was gluten free. We made a reservation and I indicated that I have Celiac disease. Enrique, our server assured me that he understood my situation. He also informed us that if I wanted to try a gluten menu item the chef would do what he could to make it gluten free without sacrificing quality. We will be back. Monday's=25% off total bill. The restaurant will begin honor in military with 20% discount. They got me for good.",

Bland, generic, blah would describe our experience there tonight...and we were so looking forward to this meal, based on the reviews and the fact they are organic and non-GMO.  After sitting for several minutes, ignored by several staff members, we were finally acknowledged by Omar, who was actually pretty nice and as attentive as he could be, as it was really busy.  The empanadas, guacamole, and mole sampler were all just...bland.  Clumsy.  I should never have huge chunks of pepper in guac!  And the chips and tortillas are not homemade.    Two stars for the ambiance--it might be a nicer space if it weren't so crowded, loud, and next to a strip club--their commitment to organic and non GMO, and our waiter.  Otherwise, pass.  Thank goodness it was 50% off for locals or our night would have been made even worse.   For a really good Mexican food experience, travel north to Viva Zapata's...still my favorite!",

First off, this restaurant is NEXT TO the Sapphire gentlemens club, not in it.  So don't let that spook you away.  We took our 10 and 13 year old there and were a little scared walking up to the place since the huge Sapphire sign was screaming at us \"are you sure you wanna take your kids here?\".  Answer: YES, YES WE DO. They have a kids menu and the server was more patient than I've ever been with my OCD and ADHD 10 year old.  So don't shy away from this place because you have kids.  Second, BEST FLAN EVER! Got the free flan with Yelp check in deal, and I'm really glad I did. Although this may be a crack dealer trick because now I'm going to have to go back there every time I'm in Vegas to get that damn flan. I believe the chef said it was his grandmother's recipe and it was awesome. It's got a very creamy texture as opposed to the usual vanilla jello stuff I get everywhere else.  Third, I've read some concerns over the salsa here.  Not sure if that's just an old review and things have changed since then or what, but they gave us 3 different salsas to choose from and all of them were very good.  The two more mild salsas weren't that hot at all, but very tasty.  The habanero salsa, too hot for my weak butt, but I'm assuming it's right up your alley if you like your salsa spicy.  Fourth, I wish I was a local.  This place has great locals deals on Monday (everything half off), and Thursdays (all you can eat street tacos and draft beer $20). They get pretty packed for those nights, so either go off peak or make a reservation.  Lastly, the service was really very good. Like I said before, our server was very good and awesome with our kids. The chef came out at one point and spent a good 5-10 minutes just talking with us about the food, our visit to Vegas, and future visits. I believe the manager also came over to check on us as well.  All around you could tell they were making the effort to make sure everyone was having a good dining experience.    -If you're going to Sapphire anyways...GO HERE -if you're a local...GO HERE (especially Mon or Thur) -if your visiting and want something off the strip and different...GO HERE -if you enjoy a creamy, custard-like flan in your face hole...GO HERE  Thanks for a great night out for my family.  You totally earned this rave review.",

Absolutely amazing. From the salsa to the flan everything (including the service) was right on. I have two days left here and I mighty have to make it back one more time before I leave. Don't miss this place if you're in Vegas and you love Mexican food.",

When I got here, I thought we would be eating inside Sapphire, so I was going to turn around to find somewhere else. I like strip clubs, but I was not sure if I wanted to eat while watching strip shows..? But, El Dorado Cantina is just next to Sapphire, not inside Sapphire.   All servers were nice and helpful. I thought the interior is kind of confusing. It looks like it wants to look fancy, but it looks odd. Also, multiple large TVs add a sport bar feeling... It is pretty chill though. The food here is just ok. 3 tacos are $13, and Burittos are about $15+. But hey, you are in Vegas. Everything is overpriced, and you should be either too drunk or hyped to care about that, right?",

    "text": "Firstly, we went here because we saw this place on an episode of \"Taco Trip\"  Las Vegas. Food is kinda pricey, but I'll pay for good food. I got the grilled steak fajitas and they were delicious. The meat was perfectly cooked and flavorful. It was a very generous portion as well, but then again for $24 if should be. On the scale of 1-5, the fajitas were a 5. My mother got the street tacos and although she didn't hate them she wasn't impressed. Her exact words were \"I'm not dying to go back\".  I on the other hand will be returning. Also, I think the fact that food is non gmo and organic is a hella plus for me.",

The Tableside Guacamole is spot on - great ingredients simply prepared - we consumed every last delicious bit.   Everything ordered was well balanced, flavorful, and a real value. But our experience was really made memorable, as all are, by the attentive but not clingy service. A nod to Tiffany at the bar who is very capable and clearly cares about her customers.   It is next to a strip club which is not our thing but they are a separate business so do not let that dissuade you.",

    "text": "Executive Summary ***The best Mexican food in Las Vegas*****  We live in Southern California where Spanish is the official second language (if not first), and we have yet to find a restaurant this delicious!  Of all places, we find our favorite Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas.  Imagine that.  We were initially attracted by the numerous reviews written, and after eating there once we understood why.  Chef Paco brings generations of passion for Oaxacan cuisine to this fine establishment.  He is not only talented, sources none GMO ingredients, but also one of the friendliest and humble Chefs I've met.  He is genuinely interested in how he can better your dining experience.  For that, I would give him more stars if yelp allowed.    Drinks: We enjoyed the \"fresco\" of the day.  Jamaica is my favorite.  Their alcoholic menu was tempting though...  Appetizer: queso fundito (three cheeses baked in a skillet) is enough for 4 people to share.  The guacamole made table side is also good.  The table next to us, all men, really enjoyed the view when the waitress was smashing the fresh avocados. ;). Again, good size to share.    Entree 1: mole--three sauces simmered for 6+ hours.  It's flavored with spice so if you can't handle it, order something else.   Entree 2: chile relleno--vegetarian's Dream come True.  The cilantro rice also has good flavor and is very buttery.  If you are not too hungry they also have street tacos and Tortas (aka: Mexican hamburgers).  Dessert: flan (grandma's recipe) was creamy and the best I had!  I also saw other delectable choices such as fried ice cream and churros.  Next time....  This is now on our \"must visit\" list when in Vegas.  We will definitely be back!  Thank you Chef Paco for bringing world class Mexico cuisine to Las Vegas, just open a few more in southern California now will you please?  Tip: it's right next to Sapphire strip club (practically sharing the same wall) so park in the same parking lot and you will see the restaurant!  Makes for a convenient excuse for those men who's wives are GPS tracking them...  \"what? Honey? Oh no you are mistaken, I'm eating awesome Mexican food, not at the strip club.\"    As the church lady would say, \"how convenient.\"  ;)  Tip#2: open 24 hrs!",

Pull into the parking lot, walk toward the building and enter through the door with the restaurant's name on it-- not hard, people.  The decor reminds me of a cabaret look which was fun. The wall covering is really pretty. It's dimly lit but not so dark that you can't see.  The chips and salsa were great. I ordered the 3 taco plate and chose al pastor and carne Asada. I loved both, but I think the al pastor was my favorite. The refried beans were spot on. I rarely eat more than 2 bites of refried beans at most places, but I finished them here. The rice was heaven. I'm not sure if I want to know how much butter they used, but the flavor was delightful! My coworker enjoyed his carnitas and al pastor taco plate as well.  The staff is very helpful and the chef made his rounds while we were there. The only thing I'd suggest to make it perfect is for the staff to just be careful to not be overly present. We were visited by 6 people including waiters, water person, 2 management types and chef during our visit. Attentiveness is great, but sometimes you want fewer interruptions when dining.   We'll be back for lunch with other office mates soon and also for dinner so we can try the bar's offerings!",

Finally we called and the girl says they are located next to Sapphires in the same parking lot. Um ok... random. So we pull in and have a good laugh because there it is....right next to Sapphires Gentleman's Club.   Been here several times now and have to say, absolutely love this place. Each experience was even better than the last. Our first time here made such a good impression. Our server was very knowledgeable with the menu and didn't give us any grief when we asked for our free taco/margarita with yelp check in. You know how that can go sometimes.   Now the food. Wow. I mean, wow! It's rare to enjoy Mexican food without the aftermath of indigestion due to all the grease and heaviness. The quality of food is on another level; \"Clean\" food. I don't feel like I need a nap when I leave this place. It's not greasy, it's not heavy, portions are perfect, and the flavors are dynamite. Basket of chips and salsa when you sit down, Table-side guacamole and a server that knows his sh*t. What more could you ask for?! Oh and all their meats are free from abtibiotic, pesticides and steroids. So awesome.   The first time we were there the chef came out and shared his grandmother's flan dessert with us. That was thoughtful and delicious.   Eat here! It's good! Trust me ;)",

Even without the discount, they're reasonably priced. $12 for my plate of 3 tacos, with rice and beans.   The only awkward thing is, it's pretty much connected to the Sapphire strip club. I won't ever go back into Sapphire (see my review about them), but I will absolutely come back to El Dorado. The inside is nothing like the club next door - it's clean, modern and welcoming.  I would recommend this place to anyone who like good food. They have a good selection of food on their menu and it all tasted very fresh. The chips and salsa were great too.",

Good Segway into my next comment, it's next to Sapphire strip club so if you get too bombed off of their delicious margaritas you can stumble next door for some zesty entertainment. The margaritas have no sweet and sour, they're made fresh to order with agave (the way all margaritas should be made). If I could purchase an IV and flow this stuff into my veins I just might. Defiantly maybe. The guac is amazing (and also made fresh to order) and the chicken street tacos, I could talk about those gems for days my fat friends. All of their ingredients are organic, the staff are super friendly and you get to walk through a curtain of beads (like from the 70's) when you need to tinkle. This place is defiantly worthy of 5 stars and for anyone who disagrees, I'd say they need a swift kick in the ass.",

From food allergies to spice level and everything in between. His authentic flavors are what keep me coming back to El dorado over and over. Best Mexican food in town, hands down, and that's coming from a local.  I recently stopped in for dinner with my boyfriend. After months of wanting to try the cedar salmon, I finally caved. My god it's delicious. We finished our meal with strawberries and cream dessert and couldn't have been happier.   Basically what I'm trying to say is, stop by. You won't be disappointed. :)",

I'm not a huge fan of 2 out of 3 of the moles and the location - adjacent to a strip club - isn't my favorite, especially since I'm bringing my young son along. That's why it's missing a star here.

We came here for the first time with friends from out of town who also were very pleased . The service was also great!

I also noticed they offer takeout which is perfect for us locals! We will absolutely be back!",

But since I came on a Monday which happened to be national tequila day we were able to enjoy the shots for five dollars as well. It's located behind fashion show mall and next to sapphire the strip club. I ordered a mango habanero margarita. And boy this Margarita is extremely hot. My friends ordered a jalapeno margarita which was delicious and more toned down in spice. A few of my other friends ordered strawberry margaritas and a Chamoye Margarita. And while they were good margaritas they weren't the best. I don't think they use fresh squeezed lime juice which is how I personally like my margaritas. The food however was wonderful. We started off with some steak nachos which were great portion they had guacamole sour cream cheese tomatoes lots of flavor. I tried the chipotle chicken which came with white rice and I chose refried beans and flour tortillas. It was so good I think I will try it again. My friends tried their very popular tacos which were small in size but flavorful. Oh and did I mention they are a non-GMO restaurant which is another plus for them. It was my friends birthday so they came out with a big sombrero and Flan which is a Mexican Custard  for her and sang to her which was super fun. Not to mention the dessert was One of the best I have had.",

We got the enchiladas, street tacos and albondigas soup.   The soup tasted like boiled dirty feet and we sent it back.

They also share the same parking lot.  We had dinner on a Monday evening. Locals discounts are not 50% anymore....it is now 25%. Reviews said getting a reservation can be difficult because they are always busy...but I guess it really depends on whether or not it's a holiday weekend or if there is a big event is in town. We were able to call in for a 7pm reservation with no problem....and we called around 6:15p.  Service was great...they were very attentive...the waiter and bus boy kept our drinks and chips/salsa full all night. Speaking of salsa....oh my. Addicting!!!!! Once you start, it's really hard to stop yourself from eating the entire first batch. They give you 3 different kinds of salsa; roasted, mild, and habanero. I can take spiciness...but the habanero slowly creeps up on you! Before you know it, half of my water is gone. But the flavoring was sooooo good though!!!!!!!  We ordered the beef enchiladas and the seafood enchiladas. Each comes with rice and beans. You can modify your sides if you like. I'm not a cheese fan but mmm...their cheese just melts in your mouth. Our entrees came out fresh and full of flavor. We were very pleased with  the quality of their food.  Chef Paco even personally came out to meet my boyfriend and I. The flan dessert was out of this world. Not overly sweet but just the right amount to satisfy your dessert cravings. It was made from his grandmother's recipe. The flan tasted like it was made right in Cabo San Lucas. You can taste the authencity...none of this artificial flavorings.  Can't wait to come back soon!",

The restaurant is darkly lit with red fluffy walls and black leather seats. Very Sim's Hot Date haha.   Okay, the food is amazing! Everything is GMO free and the closest you can get to authentic Mexican food. I tried the Vegetarian Burrito and it was so delicious and flavorful! The beans weren't overpowering and you really get all the different spices put into it.   I would say my only two concerns were that it took a while for our food to come and the flan was a little undercooked. Other than that, the waiter made us feel comfortable and was super helpful in suggesting us food since it was my first time there. Definitely recommend !",

The executive chef Paco was such a delight and was thrilled to hear that the flan was his grandmothers recipe. The texture on this flan - man o man. Simply delish! Thanks to Erica, our waitress, we checked in and got it free. The Food Network got it right on this one. #Sensational   ps : Monday locals 25% off everything including booze yeeyee  Thanks so much, Danny! You rock!  Great as always",

The portion serving was very generous!  The one appetizer that is a must if their steak quesadilla!!!  OMG how wonderful it was!!  For entrees we had the Molly sampler Molay enchiladas and the chipotle chicken.  The presentation of the dishes especially for a Mexican restaurant was lovely!!  Although everything was absolutely fantastic one element that stood out surprisingly was the rice...  all of us actually we're happy to eat the rice by itself that's how delicious and flavorful it was!  Overall highly recommend!",

The Uber pulled up to a strip club and I was like did men just write these reviews and no wonder my husband picked this place. As we approached the club the gentleman showed us the door to El Dorado. I was happy it had it a separate entrance. The manager served us and she was really nice giving us excellent service and recommendations. We started with the table side guacamole. It's really good with the jalepeno margarita. The salsa's are the best. Salsa may just be my favorite food and the salsa trio was exciting. You can't stop eating chips. For the main course we decided on the street taco platter of 10 tacos. I liked the carne asada and my husband like the al pastor the most. My second favorite was the pork taco with the pineapple. We shared a side of rice and beans. This is one of the best meals I've had in Vegas. We didn't even have room for the Yelp check in offer of free flan. We were so full and satisfied. I would come back although compared to our favorite Mexican restaurants in Colorado I thought it was a little overpriced, but hey, it's Vegas everything costs more.",

Nice ambiance for drinks and Mexican food. And they actually serve Mexican corn. Yum. Don't think about how it is 3x the cost of getting it on the street in Chicago or Oakland. I said don't think about it.   Just enjoy your tasty tacos with your large margarita. They are a margarita bar so don't miss out! And they make up for the pricey-ness of the food with generous glasses of alcohol.",

Entering the RIGHT door could drive you to lust. And should be part of another review. Maybe. Stay focused!!! ANYWAYS. Back to El Dorado Cantina, this is a place where they serve organic, non-GMO, authentic Mexican food. And they rock at it! Chef Paco is putting his heart at it, and you can feel it throughout your whole experience there.  I went with a friend and took the decision to try... The grasshoppers. It took her more than 20 minutes to be able to eat the first one despite all my efforts to convince her. When she finally made it, she couldn't stop and finished the whole plate... And even wanted some more! haha All is super delicious, from the appetizers to the entrees, and even their desserts! The flan is to die for. And if you're lucky enough, Chef Paco would come to greet you and tell you the story behind this flan from his grandmother. I love the way they decored the space, bringing a part of Mexico to Las Vegas. They have a private room in the back which is perfect for birthday parties or any other special event, and can sit I would say around 30 to 40 people in full capacity. You can see all their awards and press releases on your way to the bathrooms. One of the good things there is it's open 24/7. So even if you come out early morning from next door, you still can have a bite there, with your date! Just saying...",

    "text": "This place comes highly recommended by a lot of Vegas locals. I was looking for a good, locals spot to try on a Saturday night and finally decided to give it a whirl. Plus we were feelin like some Mexican!   The table started off with some of the table side guacamole. The wife makes some pretty darn good guac so it's kinda tough for me to go out and be wow'd by what we buy out. However, this was absolutely delicious. Fresh as can be and very flavorful. If you like guac, make sure you try it here!  The wife went with the street tacos. She hasn't had a ton of tacos so doesn't have much to compare it to but she fell in love with them. Said they were amazing!  I got the Mole Sampler. I gotta be honest, I didn't love the chocolate Mole. But that's not because of the way they made it, it's just because chocolate on chicken was weird for me. The green and chipotle Mole's were DELICIOUS. It came with cilantro rice and I got black beans based on server recommendation. As someone else mentioned in a review, the cilantro rice is great but it could also be called butter rice lol.   The service was second to none. The manager made our table side guacamole and later came to check on our service and how our dinner was going. Our server, Enrique, was as good of a server as I'd ever had. Chatted with us for a while, made recommendations, ran us through their other specials during the week suggesting we come back on locals Monday's for the 25% off, etc. If he's not part owner, I'd be shocked. He pitched the place like it was his own. I will certainly ask to sit in his section again the next time we go.   We will be back without and doubt. If you haven't been, GO.",

Waiters were very inattentive, no one checked up on us, and when we asked for info on our orders we wouldn't get a straight answer. Manager David Corr was no help what so ever. They were supposed to give us complementary drinks for waiting that long but not everyone at our party got the drinks. And when the waiter brought the drinks he made a comment saying that the drinks were gnna come off his paycheck and if we could pay for a few of them. When they did come out for the food the waiter was giving people I correct plates, just placing them where ever on the table. One the veggie tacos had some hair on it, when we informed the chef he responded very rudely telling us to go check his kitchen if we wanted. They gave 5 dollar coupons as a way of saying sorry, no good, left them in the table, if I could give this place a half a star I would. There are so many restaurants in Vegas to go to. So please, avoid this place . Go to the Strip club (Sapphire) and eat if you'd like to but avoid this place.",

I'd say it's a great spot for the tourists to hit up while they stay on the strip but, being a local here I have many more options to try.   Now let's get down to business, the eats!  Light crispy chips served with red and green salsa.   We ordered the table side guacamole, an assortment of street tacos, beef taquitos and albondigas soup. If I had to choose my favorite taco then I'd say the Cochinita was the tastiest. The beef taquitos were ok but, the portion size would be more fit for a child's menu. The only item I didn't care for at all was the Albondigas soup. It was very bland.   The Best thing I had here was the flan. It was Creamy deliciousness.   While none of the dishes were terrible, I don't feel like the price and the 20 minute drive is worth coming back.",

The tortilla did not seem to be made on site. The excellent tomatillo and roasted tomato salsas were standouts and saved my dish. We also had the mahi tacos - the fish portion was small, and there was lots of cabbage, mango, etc. with the taco. Flavorful but not filling enough for my fellow diner.",

However, I ordered mole poblano and was completely disappointed. The first two times I ordered it, my ordered was cancelled for unavailability. I thought the prior unavailability was due to popularity, however perhaps that was not the case and when I ordered it the third time, they simply replaced my order with something else, unbeknownst to me. The dish I received did not resemble mole at all; it did not have the rich, chocolatey and spicy flavor that I love. Always a disappointment when you wait an hour for delivery then throw your entire meal away.   Worth a try, but I would not suggest the mole.",

This place was not like anything yelp depicts it as.  My server jeff was rude and not attendant.  I'm pretty sure I saw the busser at my table more times than this guy.  Drinks came out fast which gave us hope but to no avail we didn't see the server for who knows how long.  We had to flag down the busser to get our order in and even then it took FOREVER to get our food.  I work in the industry and i know when a place is busy and food delays are expected and i know when the server forgot to ring in our order and let me tell you the restaurant wasn't at max occupancy....   My bill was over 100$ for two people and to spend good money in there and have to ask for everything.... rethink your prices because that's not acceptable in any fine dining establishment and this place is far from fine dining.   I don't think I'll be recommending this place if this is the type of service they are giving to people, I definitely won't be back in the dining room.  I might give the bar a shot because that was the only part of our experience that we felt was doing it's job.  Lesson learned here is not to trust everything you read on yelp.",

They have a huge menu and a LOT of gluten free items which I need. I tried the Posole and the Chicken Taquitos. The Taquitos were crunchy and flavorful. The Posole didn't have the depth of flavor I was looking for but was comforting. Their Flan was a little too dense and sweet for my taste, also lacked the characteristic bittersweet taste from the caramel sauce. Their roasted tomato red salsa that comes complimentary with chips is soooo amazing. If this place was close to home I'd probably be there every week. Definitely can't wait to return and try more stuff.",

    "text": "Where do I start???  I totally never considered this place because it is right next to the Sapphire men's club and I just assumed it would be cheesy and it is SO NOT.  The first reason I selected this restaurant for dinner was because I was trying to find a good place for dinner in Vegas that had a good selection of gluten free food.   They have this as well as serving quality foods that can come not just gluten free, but also vegetarian and vegan and the menu is very clearly marked.    We had a 7:30 reservation and arrived at 7:10 and were seated immediately on Friday night.  It was not crowded when we arrived, so I guess that was helpful!  It was a little dark and I had to use my phone to read the menu, so next time I might ask to be at one of the tables with a light directly above, but otherwise we were very content at our high table near the bar.  The decor is pretty; love the red satin floral walls!  Great ambiance overall.    Our service was fantastic.  Our server, Lindsay, was friendly, professional and very attentive.  At one point, one of our party of disliked the cocktail that she ordered and Lindsay whisked it away and brought her something she enjoyed more.  She also made menu suggestions and answered all of our questions.  We were visited by multiple people, including a woman I believe is the manager (at least!) and Chef Paco.  They made us feel special and well taken care of. I honestly consider our experience excellent customer service.  The menu has a great selection without going crazy.  Pricing is a little high for Mexican food, but the food is very high quality in flavor and preparation.  I personally had the aguachiles and Mexican Corn and I was very satisfied with my dinner. Some other dishes my friends had were pork (Cochinita) street tacos, mole enchiladas, and lettuce wraps.  We loved EVERYTHING.  OH MY GOSH... the corn!  SO YUM!  I found that if you check in on Yelp, you get free flan, so we all did.  I'm going to tell you, I'm not a fan of flan, but this flan was delicious.  Nice and firm and very tasty.  While we were \"desserting\", Chef Paco brought out a dessert for us to taste that he was working on.  It was a molded gelatin thing with raisins in it and a delicious rum sauce on it.  None of us were super excited about the gelatin, but the sauce was so delicious we all started scooping it onto our flan and we called Chef out again so we could tell him, he needs to put that sauce on the flan and that it is so tasty we want it in a bottle.  He's such a sweetie that he went back and poured us shots of it!!!  He said it was an eggnog rum sauce.  Whatever it is, make sure you ask for some to pour over your flan.  it's the BOMB!  Overall, everything about our visit to El Dorado Cantina was fantastic.  I will eat there again and take my friends and family!  I highly recommend you eat here.  It is a wonderful restaurant.",

    "text": "When a Yelp function was canceled 15 minutes after it was scheduled to start, Kelly R. and I wanted a place to drown our sorrows.  El Dorado won the coin toss.  We sat at the bar, where we commiserated about our shared national despair with our bartender, Nell, who whipped up some potent white sangrias for us.  I think El Dorado makes the best sangria ever; no limpy, wimpy glass of fruit juice, it's full of fresh fruit and a generous helping of alcohol spiking the wine.   All that talk, chips, and tasty salsa got us hungry, so we shared a Signature Bowl, choosing the grilled steak with cilantro, black beans and cheese.  It was delicious, and half the bowl was more than enough to eat, especially after all those chips we scarfed down.    We also shared one of the complimentary flans that we both got for checking in on Yelp, saving the other one for another time.  It's among my top three lifetime flans in terms of creamy deliciousness.  Nell was a great bartender, server, and post-election shrink.  And another thing that I love, though my patriotism might be questioned, is that not every TV in the joint shows sports.  The one right in view at the bar treated us to a Shakira concert, followed by one by the late, great Selena.  Not to worry, sportsaholics, there are other TVs that cater to your obsession.  Just choose your seat carefully.  To the uninitiated, El Dorado Cantina, which is open 24 hours, is physically connected to that famous blue neon gentlemen's club, Sapphire (though not connected otherwise).  Neither of us had ever been there, so in the interest of providing info to tourists, we popped in for a quick look-see.  Locals don't have to pay the big admission fee.    So go to El Dorado, and if you don't want to have that fabulous flan, you can go next door for your \"dessert.\"  You CAN have your cake and eat it, too.",

Last night we caught Book of Mormon Broadway show at the Smith Center and needed a satisfying and bursting of flavor meal afterwards. That's kind of hard at 10:30pm to go to a half decent spot.   This spot is open 24/7 and right next door to your local Sapphire Strip Club! What a brilliant restaurant owner. If you're coming for dinner it's best to have reservations. Lucky for us it wasn't too busy! (Perhaps time was on our side)  As many Yelpers could agree THE TABLE SIDE GUACAMOLE is everything. One bite and you'll understand why it's worth the $14. Also, the house FLAN is MUST so take a couple less bites of your entree to save some room! (;  The menu is pretty simple so it's easy to pick your typical Mexican dish. (Great!) The staff is friendly and excel in great service. However, like most of the great spots around time it. Service always depending on how busy they are. So it's a hit or miss but the food makes up for it.   Overall, El Dorado Cantina is about convenience, great authentic food, great decor, great staff, great organic and non-gmo food for the health cautious eaters.   Negatives.... Insufficient parking spots, awkward venue next door, only one complimentary chips basket that they announce so awkwardly from the start.   If I was the judge of your potential selection of this spot it's MUST spot to check out it may need a couple visits in order to become a favorite. IT'S WORTH IT.",

    "text": "It was hard to find El Dorado Cantina at first. The sign is there in plain view, but it's attached to the Sapphire Nightclub/strip bar, so at first we missed it. Circle back around by Circus Circus, and yes, there it is, the Cantina's front door is next to the Sapphire front door. It was noon-ish on a Sunday so you could see the guys in the black suits at the door were relaxing before it got busy.  However, walking into the El Dorado you forget for just a moment that there is a wall separating you from the Sapphire and you are greeted by a pleasant hostess who takes you to one of the many large booths surrounding the circumference of the room, with a few high tops in the middle. There is a large bar with star shaped lanterns above illuminating the wide assortment of liquors and beers. The red rose \"wallpaper\" and old, rustic mirrors lends a Mexican Bordello theme.  The waiter brings you a generous amount of tortilla chips and 3 salsas, verde, roja and a yummy orange-habanero that packs an after punch.  The regular margarita we ordered was nice, I asked for less agave and it was just right.  We ordered street tacos (carne asada) (it comes 3 to a plate with rice and beans), pozole soup and a chicken bowl (marinated chicken with brown rice, black beans, lettuce, pick de gallo and guac). Everything was super good! I'll definitely be returning. Total bill for 3 food items and 2 margaritas was $68 and change.  What I found most impressive was a lot of the meats, dairy and veggies are GMO free and organic/range free. What a great thing in a city that thrives on gaming, boozing, and strip clubs (luckily there's one right next door).",

We tried getting a table for two at 6:30pm and the hostess let a group budge in front of us possibly for the last table. We were then told that they've been \"booked for a week\" and were refused service. I think I've had enough of this place and the problems associated with it, time to find a new spot. Even when we do have reservations, it seems to take them forever to clear a table and we wind up waiting 30 minutes or more. Heading to Rollin Smoke down the street!  2015-05-09 Update Dropping my review to 1-star after noticing I'm a victim of a tipping scam at this restaurant. My bill from 04-29-2015 was $24.86 and I left a $6.00 tip making my total $30.86. Upon checking my statement, it looks like the waiter decided to write himself a $60.00 tip instead!!! I am furious right now as my credit card statement shows that I was charged not $30.86, but $84.86 instead!!!  --- 2015-04-29 I've been here at least ten times now and I have to say, pleased 90% of the time. The only time that I wasn't happy involved the AVN convention having booked the entire place out and El Dorado not having space for us.   In general, every item on the menu is great. My favorite is the fajitas, all different meats. The guacamole is a must get for your chips, and the margaritas are pretty amazing too. I think the only item I didn't like from here was the enchiladas.  And everything is organic and GMO free!",

Spicy Salted Peanuts Chocolate Covered Graham Cracker Bites  Open 24/7 and helmed by Chef Paco, a Mexico City native whose dedication to quality sourcing cannot be overstated, El Dorado Cantina had long been on my Las Vegas culinary to-do list, and although the Industrial Road location adjacent to Sapphires Gentleman's Club is unlikely to win the restaurant any awards both the interior of the space and the quality of cuisine are the very definition of 'diamond in the rough.'  Originally slated as a small birthday lunch with an old friend visiting from Phoenix, but eventually growing to a party of nine ranging widely in age, ethnicity, and culinary experience it was just prior to noon that we entered the softly lit cantina and with televisions showing conference tournament action juxtaposing heavy woods, vibrant colors, and a well-appointed bar it was with the service of a young man named Jesse that the experience would commence, all beverages kept brimming throughout the nearly two-hour stay while plates were presented with excellent pacing and descriptions befitting the excellence of the Chef's food.  Beginning with warm chips and a trio of spicy salsas at a pair of tables pushed together in order to accommodate our group it would not be long before an order was elected and with most selecting water as their beverage of choice a trio of appetizers emerged from the kitchen after a mere fifteen minutes, the sauteed grasshoppers a novelty plate that neither wowed nor appalled with a slightly funky flavor somewhat similar to frog legs faintly perceptible beneath acid and spice while two plates of melty cheese served with tortillas were absolutely reference standard, the request for more shells briefly forgotten but soon rectified leaving not a drop from either skillet behind.  Happy to share-and-share-alike it was with little indecision that the table decided our best bet for experiencing a wide swath of El Dorado's cuisine resided in one of the signature \"Feasts,\" and briefly doing the math only to realize that cost-per-person would be a mere $20+ it was in the \"Grande\" offering that we invested our appetites, a pair of enormous platters more than half-filling the large table with not one dud amongst the items to be found.  Truly a glut of food, the total number of items trumping a dozen while likely weighing in at just as many pounds, it was with the meat selections that tasting began and although the carne asada was ever-so-slightly overcooked for my tastes the shrimp, chicken, and chorizo all impressed while tender vegetables including grilled paddles of cactus more than made up for any perceived lack of moisture - none of this an issue when taking a look at plate two, each overstuffed burrito amongst the best I've tasted in recent memory while taquitos were light and greaseless, the chicken quesadilla also quite special with onions adding a smoky, aromatic punch.  Admittedly full, to the point where a solid meal or two's worth of food was boxed up to go, it was still without hesitation that dessert was ordered and although the boozy tres leches was quite excellent beneath whipped cream and fresh fruit it was Chef Paco's ancient flan recipe that stole my heart, the texture far more thick than many would associate with the dish, but each caramel tinged bite proving as good as the last until each plate was clean, the chef himself standing tableside and offering gifts from a care packaged straight from Mexico while discussing his passion for cooking as the meal reached an end.  Organic + Non-GMO + 24/7 + Authentic Mexican Food + Next to a Strip Club = an equation only Las Vegas could dream up, and like many things in this fabulous city it works like a charm.",

So we were sitting in the bar area and we were hesitant to order the table side guacamole made to order, because we weren't sure if they would do it at the bar areas... And they did we were soooo happy! And to top it off it was so yummy! We also ordered their empanadas and they were delicious too.  So I can't forget about their amazing and best part their Sangria... We ordered a pitcher of it and we lived it out bar tender was nice and told us it was a great choice!  Not a lot of places offer chips and salsa and they not only give you one kind but 3! Yummy! I can't wait to go back to this place. Also if you check in to this place you get a free flan! So don't forget to check in when you come to this place for the free flan because it's also an A+  Also helpful for vegan and gluten free people!  Very authentic Mexican food and the decor is very nice!",

The servers and bartenders looked miserable and tired! Hardly anyone smiled. I could tell they were busy but, DAMN... do you want my tips or not? I felt like our bartender was so exhausted. I think he was purposely avoiding eye-contact so he could catch his breath.  Another miss was the chips and salsa. It was exactly what you'd expect at any old Mexican place, not a gourmet place. I had higher hopes.   Now for the hits... The steak sopes were very tasty. I enjoyed the chipotle chicken and, of course, the flavorful rice! But our final server, Chris, was the redeemer of this place. He was friendly and attentive. He made great recommendations and he was so kind. Also, he offered us the holy grail of El Dorado - the flan...  After consuming drinks, appetizers and entrees, we were so stuffed... but when we tasted that flan, we devoured it like animals! It was amazing! Definitely the best flan I have ever tasted. I could go back just for that. :-)",

Then I see the sign....Uumm, do I have to go to a strip club to eat food? I'm concerned since I am here with my sister and that's totally creepy! We park and start walking up and you hear the music from Sapphires and I am wondering when we are actually gonna just leave. We open the door and you are no longer remembering where you are! The place is beautiful. I can't believe I'm in this seedy part of town, inches from a strip club. It was slow that day so our bartender Tiffany was able to chat with us for a while. She was AMAZING! Took very very good care of us. The strawberry margarita's she made were wonderful, refreshing and strong.  We planned on eating all this shit but didn't get around to it. We wound up having the fundido with sauteed veggies and mushrooms (outstanding!), a mexican corn (OMG, so good) and the flan (which by the way was complimentary with a Yelp check-in). Everything was great, it really was. But the flan.....I loved it. It's usually runny and very gelatinous looking. This was more creamy, like a cheesecake. Not thick and rich, like a NY cheesecake. Creamy wonderfulness. That's the way I'd describe it. Food was excellent, service was FANTASTIC, prices were very good as well. The offer locals a 25% discount on Mondays (awesome...we went on a Monday!), and they have happy hour specials. I will return here again soon. I enjoyed tremendously!",

    "text": "Don't let the location freak you out if you are the uptight kind (although that's probably not likely, because Vegas). The restaurant shares the same street address, parking lot and building as the Sapphire strip club, while also being surrounded by other strip joints, sex shops, and showgirl supply stores. Sorry if you are expecting dinner AND a show though (like our cabbie \"Titties and tacos, pretty ladies? You in for a good night!\"); El Dorado has it's very own entrance and, as far as I could tell, no direct way into the strip club. Probably a good thing; trying to tuck dollar bills into a G-string while eating chips and salsa could be tricky. :/  So speaking of salsa, here's the good stuff: *The salsa is bomb! Like other reviewers stated, you get a trio of salsas, from mild to hot. It's all about the habanero, all day long. Delicious. And the chips were super fresh and crispy. *Drinks are poured heavy. At least ours were. It was nice to actually taste the tequila after drinking sugar water on the Strip for three days... *Ambiance is super chill. Intimate, but less romantic intimate and more sexy intimate. Fitting... *Food is great; meat was really tender, vegetables were fresh, beans were perfectly flavored. *Reasonably priced for the quality you get for being in Vegas. *Close enough to the Strip that you could walk from the north end (if you were so inclined), but far enough away to give you a bit of respite from the chaos for a couple of hours. *Did I mention it's next to s strip club?  And now the \"meh\" stuff: *While the ambiance was chill, it was dark as hell in there. The lights were so dimmed that my friend and I had to turn on the flashlights on our phones to read the menus. That's the kind of crap my 65 year old mother has to do. :/ *Food came out warm, at best. While it was still great, having hot food is always a bonus.  Overall, great Mexican spot. Totally going back when in Vegas again.",

They also could/should include some lime and cilantro since they give you tortillas and then you could make your own tacos.    The Carne Asada was a bit better than the pork, which was a bit disappointing since pork is my favorite thing at almost all Mexican joints.  Everything is good enough just not nearly 4.5 stars good. Pork also a little dry.    Also only 1 of the three salsas we got were any good at all.",

    "text": "This was above and beyond some of the best service and vegan food we've ever had (especially in Vegas).   My boyfriend (vegan) and I (meat-eater) were visiting Vegas from Seattle and unfortunately there aren't a lot of options to find equally amazing vegan and non-vegan dishes.   We originally tracked this place down through <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eatingveganinvegas.tumblr.com&s=1702f739f7ea6d584ff88fdeb65c515dac574a011cc4e45f2b4bff0ec2737bc2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">eatingveganinvegas.tumbl...</a>.   Don't let the strip club next door throw you off. The restaurant is through a separate entrance. The space is comfy and approachable. Great music.   Where this place really shines is their staff. Our server Rorke had a great sense of humor, sweetest guy ever who was very knowledgable about everything on the menu. The menu is easy to navigate through to find vegetarian and vegan friendly options.   They made our guacamole at the table with fresh ingredients. The margarita had fresh juice and was a generous portion and well balanced. The chicken was seasoned perfectly, the dressing was really good. My boyfriend ordered the vegan veggie bowl full of brown rice, black beans, fresh veggies and was well garnished. Everything was delicious!   We cleaned our plates and were stuffed but Rorke still offered us a free vegan dessert and we decided to take him up on the offer. We were glad we did! They were amazing. Warm, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, cinnamon-sugar goodness with fresh berries and warm 100% cocoa, dark chocolate dipping sauce. If you could only see the look on my boyfriends face.    Chef Paco personally came out to greet us at our table and asked if everything was good. This man was the nicest, most passionate guy, who goes above and beyond to make his customers happy.   Highly recommended, we will be back again!",

We were looking for an organic non-GMO place to eat other than WF. I gave this a 3 only because my soup had more broth than hominy or pork, small bowl & a little cold. The waitress seemed preoccupied. Plus it's shares same building as a gentleman's club near a shopping center. The crazy thing is they deliver? And It stays open 24hrs!",

It's open all night too which is a plus for those not in the mood for Roberto's to get that late night Mexican fix. I've been a few times and the service has always been wonderful. The salsa is super yummy. Recently, I had the al pastor tacos which were just like off the streets of Mexico (authentic but definitely more pricey). It's super dark inside but hey...there's no need for good lighting in a Mexican restaurant next door to a strip club. Again...pricey for Mexican food but definitely delicious.",

    "text": "Well, we originally went here because we heard about the vegan fare. There really isnt any vegan fare.  There are a couple of items on the menu, for example a salad that qualifies as vegan and a few others.  The atmosphere is gorgeous, but what is funny is that on our first time here, we had my husbands parents and my son and when we arrived we had no idea it was in the Sapphire Gentlemans club building. That was a shocker.    My husband had to go in to make sure it was appropriate to bring our son and the parents.  However, keep in mind that when we were going into the door, the music blaring from the gentlemans club outside was saying something to the effect of \"co*k and Bal*s\" so that was absolutely not appropriate for my 9 year old.   This is what everyone tried, the fruit margartias (not very flavorfull or sweet) the mexican corn (fabulous) the chile relleno (tasted cooked earlier and heated up) chicken salad (gorgeous and flavorful) corn Raja tacos (very good) Chicken Lettuce Wraps (good)  Quesadilla (my son - good, but he ended up getting sick after and threw up all over my husbands truck on the freeway home - we think that may have been the 6 maraschino cherries he ate though, we are not sure) it did ruin our 300 dollars we spent on Rock of Ages tickets either way because we had to leave 1/2 way through because he was sick as a dog.  I wanted veggie fajitas, but I hate mushrooms and they already had their veggie mix, so were not able to make it customized.  This really bothers me because at this level of pricing, we should be albe to order anything we want.  Bottom line, there are too many other good restaurants in town in my opinion to go out of the way to go tho this area and be exposed to the rif raf and not be able to get a meal I love.  I will say one thing, our waiter was amazing. He figured out how to get me veggie tacos with no mushrooms made and was a great at satisfying the customer.  Thanks to him, it was a better experience that it would have been.  PS: the kitchen must be small because the food comes out one plate at a time.  I wish I could say better things, but  a lot of negatives here.",

    "text": "The food here is really good. I've tried the al pastor, carnitas, carne asada, & shredded chicken street tacos - all were very tasty. My personal favorite is the al pastor. Plates are served with beans (okay)and cilantro lime rice, which is a nice change to the normal Mexican rice.   The chicken lettuce tacos were also very good. At first I was hesitant to order them, fearing it wouldn't be enough to fill the belly.  The tacos are large and served with diced chicken in bib lettuce with some toppings. As it turns out, they are actually quite filling and delicious. A hungry male might be inclined to order a street taco on the side, but it should be plenty for the average gal.   The empanadas weren't extraordinary, and for the price it wasn't much. I probably wouldn't order this item again.   The flan was definitely the standout item here. I would forgo the appetizer and save room for this instead!   They serve red and green salsa with the chips (first basket is complimentary), both are yummy. They also have (had?) a spicy habanero salsa. When I first started coming here it was served with the chips- but the last couple of times it hasn't been. Not sure if you have to ask for it now or it was taken off of the menu?    Service here isn't the greatest, thus the -1 star. I've been here several times when they are busy and slow. Its always a crapshoot. They forget to go orders, take a long to take customer order, etc.   Overall, you won't be disappointed with the food. It's tasty and the organic aspect makes you feel good about eating it. It's a bit expensive, but locals get a discount on certain days. If the wait staff can step up their game, it's easily 5/5 stars.",

    "text": "I'd give this place no star if possible.   Long story short, the chef came out and yelled at is cause we didn't like the food and found a hair. And the waitress was super snarky. Never going back. Story on the bottom of you wanna read. Just needed to let people know. **Fun fact, my girl friend looked up the place here on Yelp and apparently a lot of the good food reviews that this place has, all come from the same IP address.  In other words, they're fake. Yelp actually gave us a warning saying that the reviews on their site are probably fake. I'll put up the screenshot if I can find it. ---------------- Came here with friends after a long day of work because it was recommended to us. We were a bigger than normal group, 9 people.   We ordered our food, and I put in my drink in as well. It was tequila shots. The shot was not that special that it needed to take almost 25 mins to get to the table. I got the drink as my food was coming out. My friend also prefer the same thing, his came to him AFTER THE FOOD.   We ate, the food was okay. I had a chicken burrito. I was okay with it. My fiance next to me was not. He also ordered a burrito. Half of the table ordered burritos.    He, unfortunately, didn't like it. Too bland. He ate half the burrito. Giving the chef a chance, maybe the other half was better, he took a bite, but it was a no go for him. He couldn't even eat the rice that came with it because he found a hair in his rice. IN IT. NOT ON TOP OF IT.    He called the waitress over. Showed it to her and said that he doesn't want the food. She looked confused and we told her to take it back. She hesitated but took it back anyways.   Not even 5 mins pass and the chef comes out. I shouldn't even call him a chef. He basically yelled at my fiance.    \"How do you not like my food? You don't eat half of it and then send it back. AND I DONT HAVE HAIR.\" He pointed to his scalp, he had small hairs. But the one we found was small. Whether of not it was his, we found a hair. And my fiance and I both have extremely long hair. So no, it wasn't ours. The chef stormed back into the kitchen complaining out loud, not caring who heard him and threw the plate back on to the dolly with the other used plates. He did this in front of the entire table. All none of us. It was super embarrassing. I don't even want to think about the other patrons on the other side eating and drinking.  My fiance also works at a restaurant though. He knows that behavior like that is not permitted ANYWHERE. Especially where he works. (Cooper's Hawk, check it out). The waitress apologizes. But then she says something snarky. \"You do know what happens next dont you?\"  Yes, the chef will get written up for the bad food. That's why my fiance complained, he didn't like it and it was literally dirty. We're not going to keep our mouths shut because this will probably happen to someone else. The chef needs to hold that. And the waitress is in no place to be telling us to sympathize or to not say anything. His job is not our problem. Especially with the attitude he showed us.  The manager came out to apologise and took off the burrito. We left immediately and didn't look back.   Going to put this up on Yelp as well.  People need to know what happened.",

    "text": "So finally got around to trying El Dorado Cantina. I know the place has gotten lot of hype mostly five star kind since day one. In my humble opinion feel like the food was good but nothing trendsetting or off the charts. The food would be 3stars. The service, entire staff, and Chef Paco not doubt five star experience. Everyone on the staff super friendly from the moment you walk in from the hostess, the wait staff, and Chef Paco that guy no doubt love the man passion not only for his food! See Chef Paco walking around the dining room introducing himself, asking for feedback, checking make sure everything is great, and fun friendly guy easy make conversations. I know one of his regular customers. So next thing know started short conversation talking stories about our mutual friends. He telling me about his family flan that passed on from generation to generation that on the menu Our waiter was great came for dinner with friend that also had El Dorado bookmarked. We had few questions being first timers and even asked is could get one of each empanada. He came back said it was ok. So between the two of us got in few things for first timers.....  We started with the empanada like mention the menu choice of three different ones but asked if could get one of each. The cheese, chicken, or beef. I felt like the cheese was the best one out of the three. The portion size was pretty size although was appetizer. My first thought was looks like mini pizza pockets. The presentation liked with the sour cream drizzle on the bottom and nice little shredded red cabbage salad with salsa on the side. Nothing really that was wow. The wings was ok. Just your ordinary basic fried wings with side of ranch and celery sticks. We ordered on the spicy side since my friend likes spicy food. It had not much of kick at all. Our entree we went with street tacos. We ordered one of each (six different ones on the menu) split each one. They were all solid street tacos. We finish was complimentary flan with your yelp check in. The family flam that Chef Paco passed on to him. I love the flan! It not as custard but more dense then regular one. So not as much jiggly going on. Still had nice cream, rich, and filling with every bite. The caramel crust on top was on point.   The only thing that found odd. Every item that came out was not HOT HOT. Not in spice level but temperature. My idea of street taco you heat the tortilla! Whatever your protein choose throw that on flat top or what not then put both together. Maybe since the restaurant literally next to strip club and way back the building was LVAC. Not sure where the kitchen is or how the place is set up. It was consistent through out our whole meal. The wings thinking deep fry then out but again not even warm warm. Empanada same the filling was not smoking hot take that first bite or cut each on in half since we shared everything. It would have made the dining experience better one.  The table side guacamole or salsa. It looks cool but we never had enough room try that one next visit. They run special all the times on different days of the week. Sunday that one of the better days our waiter was telling us. The Happy Hour prices especially the food times are steal of deal. Like not been mention before might not be in the best of areas, or could get lost thinking going to Sapphire or El Dorado Cantina. Literally both front doors next to one another. If not been El Dorado Cantina place worth checking out. The bar area nice size. Lots of televisions to watch sports, decor has different vibe, and hell if feel adventurous always go next door keep the good times rolling or taking it whole another level. LoL!!!!!",

    "text": "This place is insane. So delicious and so worth the price! I try to cook as much as possible, eat at home as much as possible, but whilst on vacation in Las Vegas, I had heard about this place and knew I had to try it!   First time here, obviously we were not locals (our bar tender didn't recognize us and made conversation)   Our bartender was Ashley. She was super sweet. She knew that we hadn't been here before and explained everything! This is what you get, this is how much you'll get, this is good etc etc.   For happy hour, you have to sit at the bar. No biggie. Bar stools and fast drinks. From 4-6pm and then 12-2am!   Upon seating: Ashley brought us water. And chips and 3 salsas. A habanero. A green salsa and a red salsa. Habanero is really hot. Green salsa is perfectly spicy but not intolerable. Red salsa is more sweet than anything. first round of chips is free.   What we ordered:  Happy hour 2$ tacos: carne asada, carnitas.  Happy hour drinks: two margaritas! 5$  ****let me explain about this place**** They serve NON GMO FOOD. ORGANIC. TASTY. Free from antibiotics, pesticides and steroids. Whaaaaaaat???? We need more restaurants like this! You can click through on their website and see exactly where their produce, dairy and meat comes from.   Impressed yet? You should be! Not too many restaurants do this!   The tacos were so delicious, the cuts of meat were larger than I expected, but the meat was so tender it didn't even matter! The tacos have a layer of guac, then meat, then cilantro and onions. The guac: fresh and creamy!!!!!   The margaritas were HUGE for 5$, but I'm also not a typical drinker so I don't know if that's just me haha! But it was strong and after 2, I had to keep it cool.   **free flan if you check in** ashley told us about this! Glad she did! Flan was creamy and not breaking off in pieces like typical flan does.  Chef Paco even came out to give us our flan. He chatted with us, thanked us for coming in, just an all around nice guy from what I can see!  We definitely recommend this place! Must try while in Vegas!",

    "text": "I would hope that the population realizes that Mexican food is comprised of only a handful of ingredients that transform into different named items. Tacos are a tortilla filled with meat, cheese, cilantro, pico de gallo and folded over once. It comes in a hard or soft shell. Enchiladas are tortillas filled with meat with cheese, onions, sour cream etc. Burritos are....you get the idea El Dorado uses the same ingredients as Robertos except they use different spices and PRESENTATION which makes a big difference not mention that it shares wall space with a gentlemens club ( strippers is the operative word here ) and a wait staff that will kiss your bottom so well you are obligated to leave a nice tip.  Expensive? Definitely. Prices are almost triple than off strip joints that serve great food.  Alcohol? Yes, again priced heavily  Ambiance? It's just ok Gluten free and something else....I forget. Either way it's an excuse to charge more. It's like overpaying for stuff at Whole Foids because it's organic.   Bottom line is I was not impressed with the taste of the food. The presentation was nice. The  fresh guacamole made at your table was good but way overpriced. $16 for three avocados and ingredients. Please. Margaritas were very good even if you only have three sips through a straw before you were finished. They were very strong.  Would I go back? No!  If you want to impress visitors from out of town this would be the place to take them. And if you time it just right you might catch a glimpse of a whole table full of strippers I just got off the shift enjoying their shift meal before returning to the laps of luxury next door.  I'm not trying to be the place up because it is OK. To each his own and all my opinions belong to me.",

I went with the carnitas tacos and it was the best \"melt in your mouth\" kind of experience.   I've been getting back into tequila lately so I went with the Paloma knockoff. I'm still trying to adjust to the flavor of Mezcal since it's so smokey and rustic. Rob made me two different Palomas and I ended up loving both anyway.   definitely will be around more often.",

This place had some really good reviews on yelp, and we were excited to try this place out. My mom complained about not being able to see her menu because she's older and her eyes aren't good. I could see perfectly, and I wanted to try something I've never had before. I ordered the empanadas and this red soup, sorry the name escapes me. The staff was really friendly, and attentive. The empanadas were okay, but the soup man....the soup. That was pretty killers. It was forest red, but wasn't super spicy like what you would think. The meat inside was good and tender, and this soup made me enjoy chick peas. It was a subtle explosion of taste in your mouth that was savory, salty, and packed a punch. IF YOU ARE READING THIS, THEN CHECK IN ON YELP YOU GET A FREE FLAN! We checked in and once we were done with the chef came out personally to give us our dessert along with his business card and coupon for breakfast. Overall the ambience, food, and experience was pretty cherry. I'm glad we ventured out of our comfort zone, and would like to com  back to try other entrees on the menu.",

Make sure to check-in when you're there to receive a free flan, locals also get 25% off. (this was on a Monday, so not sure if this applies during the weekend)  I can't wait to come back!",

    "text": "First thing you'll notice as you approach this place is the immensity of Sapphire Strip Club and its parking lot, which is shared between the two establishments. It was my wife and I out to dinner on my birthday.  As we pulled into the parking lot, it felt as if I was taking my wife out for a fun birthday celebration at the strip club. As we walked into El Dorado Cantina, we were nicely greeted by the hostess lady, who quickly assigned a table for us. Wednesday night, no wait at all. Server approached quickly. Friendly and informative about menu choices. Menu specifies the sources of their ingredients. GMO free! I knew this place was authentic Mexican food when I watched Juan Gabriel singing to mariachi music on Tvs, and also when I saw the \"chapulines\" (crickets) appetizer on the menu. A Tex-Mex restaurant doesn't typically offer \"futuristic\" protein of that sort. Margaritas were a must. I had one with muddled blackberries, my wife just a regular one. Both good but the blackberry one particularly interesting.  We ordered the shrimp aguachiles and the chapulines appetizers. Though I'm used to the shrimp (or fish) being thinly sliced in the aguachiles, this one was served whole. It was really good though. The level of salt and acidity worked out perfectly with the onions and peppers in it. For the chapulines, they offered garlic-lime or habanero. I went for the first choice since we already had requested some habanero salsa for chips. The texture was crunchy-toasty in the outside and soft inside. I got hit with a tangy-lime flavor, then lightly sauteed garlic, which was subtle and contrasted well.  The cochinita and tongue tacos for main course were good. Rice and beans were served on the side. Rice was good, refried beans were ok. Maybe a little non-GMO lard would've done the trick.  The appetizers were the highlights of the night without a doubt.  We got a really good \"Napolitano style\" flan for dessert for checking in on yelp, delivered by Chef Paco himself. If you consider yourself an adventurous foodie, you have to make it here and try the Chapulines. Chef Paco told me he gets them straight from Oaxaca Mexico. Good stuff. I would definitely go back for those appetizers, and maybe try something else from the main course menu.",

From the moment you walk in service is great, drinks are great and what can I say about chef paco - his food is excellent  street tacos my wife's favorite as for me the chapulines are the best. This hidden jewel in the Vegas is the real deal when it come to Mexican food. And don't forget to order desert try the \"flan\" his grandmothers receipt. You will love it. Thank you chef paco for the time you take to thank and make sure everything is ok in every single table every time we are there. Something you don't see in the restaurant business anymore.",

They believe in sustainably-raised products, where all of their beef, chicken, pork, shrimp, and fish originate from carefully-selected farms in the U.S. and are free from antibiotics, pesticides, and steroids. Or so said their website, and i believe it.  I always get their tostada salad and it is so fresh and full of goodness that i always ask them not to add the dressing.  The service is JUST okay... I do takeaway but have sat down twice and felt like I was inconveniencing them.  As far as service goes they aren't the worst but they are the best.  Like i said i loved the fresh food.  My friend said the tacos were greasy but she is a bit of a debbie downer so I take it with a grain of salt.  Do note they are in the Sapphire Gentlemen's Club parking lot.  there entrance is in the same building just a couple feet away :)",

    "text": "We went to this restaurant based on reviews seen on yelp. We made reservations for 7:30 on a Saturday night. Upon arrival we were quickly seated. I was shocked that this place was next to a strip club but you would never know it once inside. The decor was festive and modern. There are large booths around a bar. Once seated someone brought  a few waters and said will return with chips. He came back and said someone would be with us soon to take our order. We waited about 10 minutes and no one returned. The same person came back and said he would take our drink order and someone else would take our food order. He suggested we start on the table side guacamole and we agreed. We watched the server go to the bartender and tell him he wasn't sure who our server was supposed to be but we had been sitting there awhile.  It was definitely awkward. The gm of the restaurant also came by but still no waiter. He came back with our delicious but spicy jalapeno margaritas and we snacked on chips and salsa. There were three provided: a red salsa with medium heat, a green salsa very flavorful, and a thin red sauce that looked and tasted like straight up hot sauce. It would have been nice if there was an explanation of the three. Next was the table side guacamole. The server came with all the fixings and asked us what we preferred in our guacamole. He went over the menu, explaining everything was non gmo including the chips. He also apologized that our server still hadn't been by. There were two small wedding parties taking place but aside from that there were only three other tables including ours. No real excuse for our \"waiter\" to not have been by in the 30 minutes we had been there. We snacked on the guacamole which needed more salt but overall was very good. You could taste the fresh avocado and freshly smashed garlic.   Our waiter finally showed up and I asked his opinion on what dish to order. He said hmm let me see the menu and suggested the pork chili verde. My fiance ordered a carne asada burrito. Our food came quickly, almost too quickly compared to the wait for a waiter.  The mole looked unappetizing on the plate chucks of meat under a thick green sauce covered in pepitas. I have had mole before but it never looked like this. I tasted a chuck of meat which was fork tender. It was hard to get it down. The meat tasted microwaved! My fiance tasted it and suggested I eat half of his burrito it was that bad! I decided to taste another piece, it was Inedible there was no way I could eat it. I moved on to the black beans...horrible too! They lacked in flavor and seasoning. It was like they opened the can and put it on a plate. The cilantro rice along side tasted like uncle bens rice with seasoning.  The carne asada burrito on the other had was awesome! The meat was so tender and flavorful.   Overall, I would probably not make the drive back to return for a meal. If in the area, maybe for happy hour which offers half off drinks and appetizer specials but the experience in a whole was a turnoff. I will stick with Leticia's  Mexican cucina in Centennial Hills which is always good.",

I love that this upscale Mexican restaurant uses non-GMO, organic ingredients. The Mexican street corn and table side guacamole were both top notch. We were served ice water and a trio of fresh salsas and chips upon sitting down. The veggie salad left something to be desired with a small portion size and overly sweet dressing. Ordered the flan with the yelp check in offer and it was some of the best I've ever had. Our service was excellent. I'd come back.",

Chicken Feinstein was a A+, unique dish unlike anything else Ive eaten before. Awesome service from Raf and Sarah, and the flan was the best Flan I've ever had in my life.

As far as Mexican cuisine there is not a place I've been to that is better. Chef Paco has created a menu that everyone can enjoy while still capturing the True flavors of Central American cooking. Counting in the prices and the specials that they run it's a no brainer. The ingredients for every dish are from premium organic sources and prepared by people that care. Anyone who works in the service industry will tell you some people are impossible to please and those kinds of people should just stay home..forever. Forget those grumps. If you have any common sense along with an appetite to match you better be stopping by here asap. Plus it's open 24/7. Skip the late night street meat that might give you botulism. El Dorado is a real slice of Mexican pride.",

    "text": "We came here on a Tuesday (July 19th) for early lunch. I was pleasantly surprised when we entered by the posh decor. I really liked the feel of the place and I could imagine it having an even cooler vibe at night. We specifically came on Tuesday for the taco specials. I waited for our server to let us know the Taco Tuesday specials and when she didn't (just asked for our drink order) I asked about the specials that were available and our server quoted us an incorrect price. When I questioned her about it, she said she wasn't sure, but she would check. Upon her lengthy return, she did correct herself, but still never mentioned any drink specials. (Later I found out they did have a special on margaritas, had I known this, I would have ordered 2 - her loss) The chips and trio of salsa that were served free were pretty good. The red one is my favorite. The green one (tomatillo) was nothing special, even borderline flavorless. The pink one was way too spicy. You couldn't taste anything but the heat, which is not enjoyable to me. The tacos we ordered were smaller than I expected especially at $3.50, but they were filled with lots of meat. I ordered two carne asada and one cochinita. I liked them both, but thought the cochinita was better as the flavor was fantastic. Although we were pretty full, we did take advantage of the free flan with the Yelp check in. Both of us are not huge fans of flan, but figured we didn't have anything to lose. We are so happy we got the chance to try it, because it was the best flan we have ever had! Chef Paco delivered it directly to our table himself. A nice touch. I think we would have had a much better experience had the service not been so lacking. We had to beg for refills and that was when we could find her. I don't know exactly what the issue was, because we were one of the only tables for the first half of our meal. There was a large party going on in the back room and I don't know if she was more concerned with them or what. We will definitely visit again when we are in town since there were many things I would like to try on the menu. I just hope the service is much better.",

He made some suggestions on the margaritas but I went with a standard one on the rocks. Their margarita mix is by far the worst margarita I've ever had in my life. It was too sour and over powered the tequila, it gets two thumbs down. I moved on to a frozen margarita thinking it might be a little better but come to find out it was actually worse. I let it sit and all the ice fell to the bottom and the mix floated to the top. The bartender noticed I wasn't enjoying my drink and offered to make me his own recipe of a \"very berry\" margarita. It's not on the menu but it was the only saving grace of the night. Hats off to the bartender, sorry did not get his name. The chips and salsa were mediocre at best. Nothing to write home about. I don't know how this place is busy, I guess it helps that they are located right next to Sapphire's.",

Our server Lindsey was great as were the rest of the wait staff.  Our reservation was at 630pm and we were seated immediately.  The only negatives was the ice tea was over brewed and it shares the building  with Sapphire.  However I would bring my wife and kids without reservation.",

There was like 3 chunks of mango that I guess was supposed to be salsa.

If you ever find yourself on the Las Vegas Strip, please make it a point to stop by and say hello to Chef Paco, he's so sweet.   Overall, I give El Dorado's a five out of five.

I got the house salad and it was great, the avacados here are sooo fresh and I can't wait to come back here again!!!  Our burritos were a little cold, and our waiter was amazing!

I get those everywhere I can just to see who has the best and these were great. The rice was a surprising win. I'm not someone who talks about how good someone's rice is but the rice was packed with flavor, as much as rice can be without added ingredients. Our server was very knowledgeable about all of their foods and how they fit the GMO-free theme. There are many yelp awards in the restrooms and on the walls and you can tell why once you try the food. I was very pleased. If you are visiting Vegas, you have to try this place and el gordo.

Drinks were brought out swiftly and waters filled before the halfway empty mark. The chips and different salsas were very tasty, too!  I had the Mahi Mahi tacos with rice and beans. The fish was cooked to perfection and was really fresh (something kind of hard to accomplish in the desert...). The beans were flavorful, but the rice absolutely made the meal! I don't know what they did to it, but it was magical!   In addition (as of that wasn't good enough) I checked in on Yelp and the executive chef personally brought out flan for us. And I'm not talking some giggly gelatinous monstrosity that strikes fear into the hearts of people traumatized by grandma's jello molds. I'm talking a smooth, silky, creamy dessert that was, quite literally, one of the best things I have ever eaten.  Go. Get the tacos. Check in for flan.  You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "El Dorado Cantina is right next door to a strip club. Kind of a strange/industrial location but I saw all the great reviews and thought I'd give them a shot. And don't get me wrong, I'm in no way anti-strip club. Maybe if I'd have had some boobs in my face, I could have given this place a better review. Instead I just had to settle for looking down at my own, which wasn't half bad and all but, read on...  For starters, they serve up some very strong drinks (no complaints about that), the atmosphere wasn't bad, but the food didn't do it for me here and that to me is EVERYTHING. I had the Seafood Enchiladas and they don't compare to the ones at Javier's. They were good but nothing to write home about. Maybe I didn't order the right things at El Dorado. I'm not sure.   My Jalapeno Margarita packed a punch but again in this department, I prefer Javier's. It didn't even taste like real lime juice that they were using. Their recipe was not my fave and dare I say eerily similar to a sickeningly sweet store bought pre-mixed even though the bartender assured me otherwise. I tried to doctor it up so I asked the bartender to add a little more lime juice to my drink and even that didn't even make my drink taste better or more lime-y, so I finally gave up and accepted my defeat. At least the drinks were getting me buzzed.   I can't really remember much about the Table-Side Guacamole but I had that too. Unmemorable is never a good sign. I think Javier's just ruined me for all Mexican food places to follow. It's possible. I'll be honest, most other places don't really compare in my eyes. I should just stop cheating on Javier's.  I'm left scratching my head trying to figure out why this place is so popular. It could be the fact that they are open twenty-four hours a day. There aren't too many high end Mexican food restaurants to choose from at all hours of the night. The chef coming out of the kitchen to greet all the patrons was a nice gesture but it isn't enough to warrant a return trip, nor guarantee a five star review from me.   I'm sad because I really wanted to like this place. I love what they are all about with their anti-GMO stance and their pride in using top quality ingredients as well as sustainable meat and fish. That's why I'm so confused about why their food was so lackluster because normally \"the good stuff\" tastes so much better to me. Off night? Beats the heck outta me!  I will say their Flan was the highlight of my meal. That stood out and was their saving grace! It was thick and creamy and off the charts good. However, unless I have an overwhelming urge to partake in that particular flan again, I probably wouldn't retrace my footsteps back to El Dorado Cantina for una repeticion.",

The inside of the restaurant is decorated with red velvet walls, but the booths are comfy and the vibe was too. Our server seemed more occupied with the bartender than us; However, the food was fresh and very good. My partner had lettuce wraps which came with a delicious carne Asada and pico de gallo. I had agua shrimp which are marinated in lime. It was served with chips though.. this seemed a little nuts to me since we had a huge platter of chips (which are fried in sunflower oil) already on the table. I asked for a lime to squeeze on it and a avocado. We also had a veggie salad which on the menu claims it's loaded with all kinds of veggies. The veggies were cut into such tiny little minute pieces you could barely find them. But I will give it the fact that it was totally fresh. Oh the dressing that came with it was thicker than tomato paste which was kind of weird. Both my partner and I did like the flavors. And once again about our server she never came and cleared the plates. I guess this is a pet peeve of mine I have dirty plates everywhere when I'm eating something else. The food is a bit pricey but it's worth a try if you want something a little fresher and not so heavy.",

I always made it a point to bring new friends visiting the area there. I am very much into organic and gmo free eating. Therefore, this concept had me so excited. Yet, they have not been able to maintain the great initial momentum. The servers I had in the past were kind, pleasant, super accommodating and provided excellent service. Then I made the tragic mistake of putting together a Birthday party get together here for one of my best friends. What a complete and utter disaster. The food arrived half cold and somewhat mediocre tasting this time. The male server was just snarky, rude, condescending and would disappear for like 30 mins at a time and the place wasn't even full. The last straw was when I tried to place candles on my friends cake at the end for her birthday. Mister snarky server came back and said we could not have the cake. Even though, he saw me walk in with it. He then came back and said oh we can have it for a $25 cutting fee. i said forget this place. Im done. We just asked for the check and left. Then after all this horrific treatment the server then placed a mandatory gratuity of 18% on the check. I work in the traveling public and prior to this visit. I would tell every new visitor that whatever you do before leaving Vegas make sure to have Mexican at El Dorado. Now I make it a point to tell every new visitor asking me where to eat. I say just make sure whatever you do. Don't go to that scam rip off of a place El Dorado. If you want Mexican then go to Michoacan or Juan's Flaming Fajitas.  Yet, this place never ever again !",

We wanted to have a fun and excellent dinner, NOT WATCH COMMERICALS OR A COOKING SHOW!! The concerts are fine but rest WTF??   The service is SUPER SLOW!!!  The food is not to die for in any way. The corn was very good. The shrimp taquitos are just shrimp wrapped in a corn tortilla and fried with salsa/guacomole. Nothing inventive about them and edible with a 3 star approval.   The triple mole pork plate is slopped onto the plate, terribly presented. The chocolate mole was the worst I have ever had. The cilantro one was a two star. The other was edible and the only one I tried to finish. Overall is WAS AWEFUL.   The RICE IS VERY GOOD!   We won't be back and have told others to not bother to go. THERE IS BETTER MEXICAN FOOD IN VEGAS.  Don't let the billboard sway you in.  (I also question that their food is really organic. The waiter couldn't give me an absolute answer either.

We ordered Margaritas, which is pretty good, salsa and chips were the best I ever had but then I ordered their Steak Bowl, which was the worst thing I ever had. It smelled bad may be because of the sauce. Within 15 mins of having part of the portion I just threw up. Not expected of such highly rated restaurant.",

We visited the restaurant for lunch and we were a little concerned about the location right next door to Sapphire (a gentleman's club), but definitely don't let the location deter you. The table-side guacamole is fantastic. We got the spicy guacamole and it was very flavorful. Best guacamole we have ever tasted. Our entrees were chicken enchiladas and a carne asada burrito. Both were delicious and we have leftovers to take home. We will definitely be eating here again.",

    "text": "Had a great birthday dinner here while visiting Vegas on June 16th. I'll start with the only thing I did not like...The table we were sat at was VERY dark. Hard to even read our menu. Other than that, i was very impressed! We were able to make a reservation on their website and easily change the time when we were delayed on making it to Vegas at an earlier time. Glad we made a reservation tho. it was busy when we got there at 8PM for our time slot!  We found this restaurant while looking up organic restaurants. I usually judge places (especially those claiming non-gmo or organic) by how i feel after eating. Just full and content! Did not feel sick or believe that they are claiming something they are not. The menu was extensive and descriptive. They even tell you what farms they get their meat from and where they source their dairy products!  Started with a huge margarita with organic muddled fruit in it. Did strawberry and then blueberry. both were delicious. my BF had a really tasty organic beer.   Started with the veggie nachos, which were really tasty and a huge plate! Probably didn't need more food after this, but since it was my birthday, we were splurging. ;-)  I ordered the seafood enchiladas which had Pacific wild shrimp, bay scallops & Mahi. The sauce was a bit on the spicy side for me, but i know I'm just a wimp when it comes to spice! Still really tasty and took half of it home. was even good heated up in our hotel microwave!  My BF ordered a carne asada burrito and he loved every bite! He managed to eat it all at the restaurant.   Ended with the Churros, which was a nice sweet ending, even though i was so full!  Our waiter, Joaquin (I believe this is the right spelling), was extremely friendly and more than happy to answer any questions we had about things to do in Vegas. Found out we were in town for EDC and shared the same interests so we had a good time chatting with him during our dinner. Quick and friendly service.   I will definitely return and recommend this place highly!",

I remember driving there in the cab and the taxi driver kept going oh you mean sapphire? No... I mean the restaurant next to it. I think he waited outside just to confirm I wasn't shy about it.   That day I stuffed my self. I had tacos guacamole and sopes and I was instantly transported to my moms kitchen.   I know a chef prides in his food when he comes out his kitchen and asks how the food is and what could go better. Nothing it was all amazing!  He suggested I check in and get a free flan. Hell yes! I'm a sucker for dessert and once again I asked if my mom was in the back cooking.   Vegas has amazing places to eat and this is one I would definitely fly into Vegas just to have dinner. I can't wait to be back!",

Whew.  Despite the location, the food here is fantastic. I'll be honest, Mexican restaurants aren't really at the top of my list when it comes to dining out but this place might alter that thought a bit. Everything was FRESH. And just as the billboards around town states, everything is organic and GMO free. You can definitely taste the difference in freshness dining here vs other Mexican restaurants.  I had the Shrimp Quesadilla meal since I was craving it and my God it was divine. The shrimp was fresh and the side of guacamole and sour cream was to die for. I literally died and gone to heaven about five times during this meal. No exaggeration. I've also tried my friend's Carne Asada bowl (BOMB) and a side of rice and refried beans; which is honestly my favorite part when eating Mexican and even that was a different tier in taste and freshness.  The only thing I didn't enjoy was the Flan since it was too sweet and thick to my preference but that can't stop me from giving this place five stars. I'll definitely be coming back to try the other things off the menu along with their cocktail selections. I hope you do too.",

    "text": "Oh boy, where to start??? I gave this place 5 stars!!! Im pretty new to yelp. Before I even saw that it was one of the restaurants on the list, I'd seen a billboard on Paradise everyday going from work. Curiosity hit me so my sister and I decided to go to El Dorado Cantina! We put the address on the gps and the only thing we saw was a gentlemen's club, famous at that! I have to admit got pretty excited! But, there is two entrances one for the restaurant and one for the club. I've seen reviews quistioning the location, if you ask me its a great business location! Just imagine watching exotic dancers and you're about to hit home or where ever you're going and hey, here is a bright idea there is a restaurant right next door! This place is stylish, beautiful decor and great staff! First time here! Had an amazing time! I checked in and recieved a free flan! So bonus for my sister and I! They brought us out a starter which is your typical chips and salsa. (they give you 3 different salsa's) I ordered from the Signature Tacos: Grilled Mahi; which comes with rice and beans! I did ask about the mango salsa due to we can't eat onions! Best part it didn't bring onions so everything was perfect! First bite in, it was to die for oh my god, all those flavors mixed together! Instant FoodGasm! The rice was interesting too it had a buttery flavor which is unique! My sister had the Tropical Salad with steak! Big portion but it looked beautiful and tasted great! One of the perks is the dressing is on the side, not like other restaurants that drench their salads. Finally, last but not least, we had Mexican Flan which was Gluten free! Not only was it thick and creamy the cherry on top was that Chef Paco himself delivered it to us! The only man that has made me feel like a lucky girl! Amazing service, amazing place, amazing staff and finally amazing FRESH Mexican Food that doesn't make you feel sluggish and fat! My #1 place for Excellent Mexican Food! Keep up the good work! Congrats on recieving top 50 restaurants in the U.S.",

Great food, excellent service, enough vegetarian items to accommodate us non-meat eaters (a few vegan items), some good beers (double IPA...excellent choice), and the red sangria was on par with the best.  Also, what is the best way to judge a mexican food restaurant?  The chips and salsa.  They were great, if you like the super spicy, make sure to ask.

    "text": "Well honestly when we pulled up we were stumped by the Gentleman's Club. But as we walked towards the front we spotted the restaurant. Upon entry cute decor, small crowd, fully stocked bar...great!   Tip: Happy Hour is daily and the street tacos are $2.50, Margaritas are $5 (Non Flavored) when you sit at the bar only.   We initially sat at a booth until we noticed everything we wanted to eat was significantly cheaper at the bar. The Street Tacos are the way to go here! Especially the carne asada!   My only gripe is the flavored Margaritas...while they were good, adding an additional $2 per serving on a pitcher of margaritas is a bit absurd, (No matter how many people are drinking from the pitcher you will be charged for 4 servings.)This caused the $32 pitcher to ultimately be $40. I live in NYC and understand things but honestly an $8 additional charge for flavoring is bogus at best! Especially since the flavoring is done artificially and not with fresh fruit puree. Also waaaaaaay to much ice was served in the pitcher. With all that said fix this margarita issue and you'll be a great find...off the strip!",

Service was OK, our waiter was friendly and personable, but somehow the bar order got mixed up and took way too long.  I'm not sure what went wrong, but it was too long a wait. The waiter did try to keep up, but I get the sense it was just too busy.  I don't blame him, just was surprised by the wait for drinks.  The tableside guacamole was quite good.  Though, I didn't really like the brand or style of chips they served with it.  The chips were too thin to drip well and didn't have much flavor.  But the guacamole was very good.  My wife had the Mahi-Mahi taco and it was tasty with the mango salsa.  I had a steak/shrimp fajita and it was OK, but a bit too greasy for my liking and the steak was a bit tough, but the shrimp was grilled very well and was really good.   I liked that they had a Juan Gabriel concert playing on the TV.  Made it the place feel festive.   Overall, it's a good place to go, especially for locals on Monday.  But reserve ahead to avoid the crowds.",

    "text": "Service I rate 5 stars, they seated us quickly, our waiter Enrique was great, we got our food pretty quickly. The ambience I rate a 5, not too crowded but busy, me and hubby were celebrating our anniversary and it was a nice spot for dinner. We liked that it was not off the extremely busy main las vegas blvd. Rate the price of food a 5, every thing in Las vegas is way over priced. The prices were not terrible but reasonable for those on a budget. Rate the drinks a 5, they did not hold back the alcohol. I would like to give a 5 for total but have to give a 4 because overall the food was not all that great, it was edible but nothing I would write home about or long to try again. The seasoning could use a little something more.  Only real negative was management did not bother to stop at our table, they kept passing by but never stopped to ask how we were doing, but they had stopped at other tables. But overall would recommend to those looking for a nice, but not to expensive meal",

Sat down (had to wait like 2 minutes for a hostess to even come to her stand) then after we were seated it look at least 5 minutes for anyone to come over. After someone did, I asked for a happy hour menu which the server said we could only have at the bar which was like 6 feet away from where we were sitting.   Once sat at the bar, it took at least another 5 minutes for someone to come by and ask us for a drink order (although there were 3 people behind the bar already). Once we ordered our drinks, the server asked if we wanted a refill on chips for a small charge. A CHARGE FOR A REFILL ON CHIPS?!? What fucking Mexican restaurant forces you to pay for a refill on chips and salsa?!?!   Food from the HAPPY HOUR MENU took 45 minutes to get as the assistant GM talked to the table behind us for 20 minutes (about where they were from) totally disregarding if we needed anything. Oh side note, she comped them guacamole just because and didn't bother to check on any of the other patrons.   Food was very good, compliments to the chef, but service was below disappointing. For $50 I could have gotten Robertos, a bottle of Patron and just stayed home.",

Would be awesome if it were in a different location! Despite the odd location, the food is incredible! I love that it is organic and the menu tells you where they source all their meat from. The Mexican corn on the cob was seriously amazing! I will get it every time I go! The carne asada meat is so flavorful and tender too. The ambiance is really cool but expect to be bombarded with drunks coming from Sapphire if you go later at night. We will definitely be back!",

Mmm it's all so fresh and hot, comes with the most delicious rice ever (cilantro lime) and your choice of beans and tortillas. It's great and it's always so hard to not order that because we love it so much. I've also tried the hamburger-- SO good! And who would have thought at a Mexican restaurant!   Margaritas-- just get one. Get the strawberry or mango (on the rocks!) with the chili lime salt on the rim and then tell me that's not the best marg you've ever had  ENJOY!",

So as I paid the bill and the 18% auto grad I also explained to him about why he didn't deserve it. I myself work in the service industry and would run the shit out of a table like this!

The servers are friendly and attentive. It's a small-ish place, but there's always plenty of places to sit. It's very clean and well kept. Good ambiance and decor. The three complimentary salsas are amazing. I could just sit here and chips and salsa all day. I really like their sangrias. The wings are decent. Far from hot. But good crispiness and coated in loads of sauce. The tacos and taquitos are delicious. They even have grasshoppers. It's a pretty extensive menu with all kinds of options. I have yet to really dive into the entrees, but I'm looking forward to doing so. If you want good, authentic Mexican food, you need to come here.",

Third of all they make this much-hyped tableside guac that could be stupendous but they put wayyyyyyy too mich lime juice in it. Or at least our waitress did.  However I will say the fajitas were great, especially the skirt steak. I would advise you if you are ordering fajitas, stick to the steak.

It has a completely separate entrance - which is helpful to know as I brought a group from work here for the first time ever and thought it was inside the strip club so we changed locations.  Once inside, the strip club is out of mind and the food and beverage take center stage. Great flavors throughout - definitely delivers a solid experience. I had breakfast here and it was empty but that did not deter and I am glad I stayed.",

The ambiance is on the fancier side and the prices are a little high, but you can see that the quality ingredients are the reason why.  I had the carne Asada burrito, and I swear they stuffed half of a baby calf in that tortilla.  It was delicious.  My wife had street tacos, and said the al pastor held its own against tacos el Gordo down the street.  The rice is incredibly smooth and comforting, and the flan is the best you will ever have.  I don't even like flan.  This place made me reconsider.  The only reason I would go elsewhere for Mexican in LV is Mexican doesn't have to be expensive to be good.  But this place is legit; Chef Paco knows what he is doing.",

First off, this place is physically attached to a strip club, which means you park in the strip club parking lot too. Unless you don't mind people seeing you there, you should take this into consideration. Onto the atmosphere. It's nice and spacious inside. Welcoming and kinda hip. The menu: the prices were a little higher than most, like on par with a resort property, but located in and industrial area...next to a strip club. I was there so I gave it a shot. I'm a keto/low carb eater so I ordered the bowl with carne asada which is $18. I asked the waitress if I could hold the rice and beans and maybe just have lettuce instead. \"No problem!\"  One coworker ordered the tostada for $14 and asked for chicken (even though they served him beef).The food was nicely presented but lacking flavor. The bill came. Wow!  My sub lettuce for no rice/beans was an extra $4! Iceberg lettuce for $4?!?! My coworker's \"tostada with chicken\" was an extra $7! My biggest complaint is the waitress never mentioned \"that will be extra.\"  I'd honestly rather spend my money elsewhere. Won't be back!",

Got our Guacamole before our drinks, no check back on the food and a table full of plates that never got bussed. I was told it was overpriced but I didn't listen. $16 guacamole using 1&1/2 avocados is not cool. And it was super bland. The girl making it was sweet but not worth$16! Skip it! House Margarita pitcher-bad! So sour I had to send it back. But never saw the Server after He poured it and until asked for the check so I brought it back to the bartender myself. She was nice and tried to fix it but I still never tasted any booze! We left full glasses behind. I don't think I've EVER done that! But I don't need to just drink mix! I'm only giving it 1 star because the tacos were good. So overpriced for mediocre everything. We still won't be back.",

I am pretty newly vegan (vegetarian for over 1 year & vegan about 2 months) so I ordered the veggie tacos sans dairy products with black beans & cilantro rice. Awesome!... until I got to the rice. It tasted buttery so I didn't eat it. I asked the waitress & she confirmed: the rice is made with butter BUT you can ask for it without butter. This was totally my bad as I didn't tell her I was vegan, I just assumed I made the dish vegan by removing the cheese. *lesson learned* The black beans were amazing! Way better than the refried pinto beans. Order them if you can! The veggies in the taco were very fresh & had great flavor.   They give you chips & a trio of salsas to start off with. The salsas, even the hottest one, could be hotter but that's just my opinion. I'm sure they are plenty hot to some.  Also had the watermelon water; it was so refreshing! They change those daily, I think. They had other flavors listed but today they only had watermelon.   I will absolutely come back & I will make sure to tell them I'm vegan! The staff & chef are very accommodating!",

Anyways we arrive at the restaurant and Mayra was our server. We ordered our drinks and poof she is gone we don't see her again for like ten min. The bartender notices we don't have chips and salsa so he gets here to come over and bring us some. She admit it slipped her mind and we are understanding that we are human mistakes happen. So we order our food and poof she is gone again we don't see her for about 15to 20min. She comes back and starts making our tables side guac. Our main dishes arrives as she is making our chips and guac. So we eat our food and having conversation and we still can't find our waitress like we can't even see her to call her over. We needed refilled and more drinks but couldn't find our waitress. She comes back I tell her hey I need to order elota(corn) to go. Everything good she bringing us our checks like ten min later I notice she didn't put elota on my bill. I tell her hey i order this to go and it still hasn't arrived. By her expression you can tell she forgot. So anyways we pay the bill and we waited another 20 min after our checks have been paid sitting like idiots just staring because my order that I placed 30 min ago was forgotten. I will never ever come back here as you made feel foolish for even recommending this place to first time vistors.  Oh yeah almost forgot when we finally got the corn it wasn't even on the cobb. Said it came off the Cobb and thought you have got to be kidding me. I would of not ordered that if I wasn't going to get the corn off the Cobb when I had it on the Cobb before. I said whatever and took because I was so fed up with this establishment.",

When we arrived in the Parking lot, we were skeptical because they share a building with a \"gentlemans club\". But we went inside anyway and it was very good. The restaurant was gorgeous inside, the staff was friendly, and the service was excellent. The food was amazing! We ordered the street tacos, and I've never had anything so good before. From start to finish this dining experience was great. I would come here again in a heartbeat. Erica our server and the rest of the staff made it a great experience and we would be happy to come back. At the end of our meal chef Paco brought out our flan and was so courteous. He explained the flan was his grandmothers recipe and it was honestly the best flan I've ever had.",

    "text": "After seeing the billboard and numerous ads in the local weekly publications, we finally tried this place. We were greeted warmly by Martina. The decor is unique, classy, festive and the room is spacious and accomodating for both small and large parties. Once inside, you quickly forget that you are right next door to Sapphire. That said, however, there are huge flat screen TVs all over the room playing concert footage at medium-to-loud volume which, I feel, distracts from an otherwise classy, upscale experience. Our server, Joaquin, was attentive and kind. The food...it's nicely presented...and \"good\". But it's not eyes-rolling-into-the-back-of-your-head-in-ecstasy exceptional. However, I appreciate that it's non-GMO and organic. I had the seafood enchiladas. Good, but not great. My partner had a caeser salad that she found \"odd\" and needed more dressing (and this is a person who doesn't like a lot of caeser dressing on her salad and usually asks for it on the side...) 2 other guests in our party found their soups to be \"too salty\". Here's an awesome incentive for locals: 25% off your bill all day Mondays when you show your local ID. And Taco Tuesdays with $2.50 street tacos and $5 margaritas. That's pretty cool. Will we return to El Dorado? Perhaps. But IMHO, our neighborhood Lindo Michoacan (while not \"organic\" or \"non-gmo\"), remains undefeated in our hearts as the #1 mexican restaurant in town.",

We had made a reservation for 7:00 for 3 people on  a Friday night, but we weren't able to locate the restaurant since it's located right in/next to Sapphire night club. Not an ideal location I'd want to go to for a restaurant, but hey it's Vegas fine whatever. Their parking lot is a disaster, good luck trying to get any direction or assistance with parking in that beat up flea market lot... and after all that hassle we finally manage to make it into the restaurant 20 minutes past 7:00. We apologize for our late arrival, but we had a reservation. I'm not even sure if the host had his mouth wired shut or he was just that much of a rude person but rolled his eyes and tried to mumble something t.....as if it was a problem...... there were 5 booths open. Wasn't even a busy night by the looks of it. We were greeted promptly by our waited, took our drink orders, returned with chips and salsa... standard fare for Mexican places, nothing exciting. My fiance ordered a carnitas burrito, my mother ordered tacos, and I a chicken burrito....and then we were left staring at the our phones as the time ticked by....it took nearly an hour to bring out three burritos. Prior to their arrival however 30  minutes in our server claimed our food was coming out soon, then a few minutes later the manager asks us if we need anything... We look around and nod, yes we still need our food? After this mind you, few more people have arrived and had had their orders taken, and food has arrived at their table. Now, I honestly don't think our meal took that much preparation, maybe for enchiladas or something of that nature but really, two burritos and tacos? Finally the Manager brings out our food, which is luke warm by now does not offer an apology for the delay. Burrito tasted like something I could've made at home, in less time and tasted better. My fiance and mother seemed satisfied with their choices, but nothing extraordinary. Ive honestly had better tasting food at hole in the wall places than this so called upscale Mexican place. After all that mess it took forever to get the check, and even longer to get the receipt and go. Maybe this place has more charm when you're there for the liquor and not a meal.  Mind you what really bothered me the most about this place was lack of customer service for ALL guests. Two girls from the club next to this place barely stepped in before they were whisked to a table behind us, drink orders taken before they even sat down, and their food was brought to them before ours was and we'd been waiting almost an HOUR. Ridiculous. Not a single apology was made about this delay.  AND to add to this whole issue, we made reservations through Open Table, and they flagged us for no shows and had to dispute that as well. Never coming back to this place.",

Just excellent service all around from Christopher.  The food was also excellent.  I had Cochinita Pibil, a signature pork dish, and my wife had the seafood enchiladas.  Both were flavorful and well presented. And the house margarita was excellent as was the flan (think and creamy). Being very picky, I am taking off one star for the following reasons - 1) my pork, while excellent, could have been served hotter in terms of temperature (I like piping hot food) and 2) there was no host to seat us when we arrived and we stood around waiting until a customer said \"we just sat down.\"  Advice on the latter point - just put up a \"seat yourself sign.\"",

If this was in the middle of nowehere I would agree that this is pretty good Mexican food. But with the Mexican food within a 2 mile radius of this place and up and down along Charleston with prices half that amount it is hard to justify that this is the number one \"Mexican place\" in Vegas. Again, I am not saying it's bad as I have been here several times already, I just can't co-sign with the reviews on here that suggests this is the best Mexican in Las Vegas. With the large Hispanic population and neighborhoods close to this area, this place doesn't even crack the top 5. If you're around check it out, but temper expectations.",

My mom had the cider glazed salmon and her plate cleaned...she loved it!!! And for dessert we had the flan which was so smooth and flavorful the best flan I have ever had!! And we also ordered the fried ice cream which was heaven!! The staff is great, very friendly, and attentive.  The GM and the chef both came out so see how we liked our meal! They could tell by our clean plates that they did a job well done!! Thank you so much for such a great experience!!",

But like I said, go for the jalapeno instead and you'll have a great experience!",

They serve non-GMO ingredients which is great because you're being fed with so many toxic food nowadays that you don't really know what's good for you anymore.   The service here is great as the person helping us out was always polite and very accomodating. He continuously asked us if we needed anything else, and clearly explained to us the menu. Not that anything about the food really needed a whole lot of explaining, but still.   I got the chicken enchiladas from here in which I was super excited for, but there was something about it that just tasted off. The chicken they used wasn't tender enough for me to enjoy the food. Maybe I was looking for an authentic enchilada. Something that was deliciously dirty packed with unhealthy ingredients. But this was clean. It was almost as though the ingredients were there but they didn't harmoneously work together.",

I had a red sangria that was full of berries and apples, very addictive! My husband and I had the street tacos the carna sada ones were a winner.

The salsa was amazing and one of the best I had ever had. It was mild but you could tell it was mixed with the right blend of onion, cilantro, and jalapeno peppers (perfectly paired with their margarita). Their tacos lived up to the hype as authentic street tacos (just enough seasoning, but not over the top). Don't get too filled up, without saving room for Flan (that comes with the yelp coupon upon check  in). I must also say the service was really impressive. The host talked for us for quite a bit about our stories and she filled us in on the history of the restaurant. I would certainly recommend if you are looking for amazing Mexican food in Vegas!",

    "text": "El Dorado Cantina EXCEEDED my expectations!!! The atmosphere of the restaurant was vibrant and chill. My boyfriend and I were greeted by two lovely women. Sat us down & a few moments later chips and salsa came out. Let me tell you, the salsa was <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>. Although our waters came out a little later than expected it didn't really matter because I was distracted by the chips. The service was decent, not too attentive but that's ok.   We came on Tuesday so it's Tequila & Tacos. Ordered the Casa de noble margarita, I believe, was tremendous. I didn't even taste the tequila which means I got a buzz on quicker. Awesome deal, Bill only came out to be 40$.  Ordered 3 street tacos, 2 of each: Carne Asada, Al Pastor and Carnitas. Honestly, these were almost as Devine as my boyfriends mothers street tacos & hers are never compared to. My favorite was the Al Pastor, adding the pineapple made the taco just 10x better. We even ordered 5 more tacos, like the first 3 weren't enough. It was just so amazing we couldn't resist.  For dessert we had flan. Such a light but fulfilling little dessert. We both shared one & at the end we  were completely stuffed!! Like so stuffed I had to hide my food baby with my coat lol  & what totally tops this place off is that most of their food items are organic & from different farms that don't harm the food we're eating.   I recommend this place to every single person out there. There's gluten free, vegan, & meat lover options. I also recommend coming on Tuesdays. Definitely a great deal for 2.50$ street tacos & 5$ margaritas.",

Usually I sit up at the bar, Victor and Kai are super nice bartenders and it's great catching up with them. The crowd is always fun. Be advised: the guacamole is table side and it's ALOT OF GUAC. So good though, you can ask for it spicier which I always do. I've had the veggie burrito and the veggie tacos.    I really like El Dorado because I can go there at ANYTIME and the quality of the food is the same. You don't find that in a lot of 24 hour places.  The only thing I don't like is the parking situation, depending on how busy sapphires is, i have to park super far but I guess I can burn off some of the guacamole I ate haha",

My mom doesn't like sangria, but out of all of the ones she's tried that I've had, she actually liked this one. The fruit is amazing too! And the margaritas are great too! It's hard to have a good mix of tequila but I thought it was a really good blend. Atmosphere is really good as well.

    "text": "I was really excited to try this place after seeing all the amazing pictures and high rates reviews. The interior is very nice and clean (including the bathrooms). I ordered the chicken tacos, the meat was a little dry. My best friend ordered the carne asada burrito and she said it was amazing. The rice is \"crunchy\" but I liked it, she was not a fan. My biggest complaint was the service. I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and blame it on the fact that our waitress was training a new-hire however, the busboy was also terrible. It took 15 min just to get a refill on my drink. They kept forgetting to bring us things we'd asked for. Finally we just gave up and asked for the check to go. The waitress was nice enough to give us the 25% off for locals. If I did order again, I would get it to go and skip the chicken tacos!",

My guests ordered a beer and it took them a long while before they were served and they were not busy at the bar. However this has been consistent and when you look at speed as part of the service it def needs mention. However, the food is amazing, fresh and tasty. Delicious, clean and ample servings. I like that you can taste the difference in the that the produce is non GMO, organic and that they have a vegan menu. My guests were not vegan and they compared the cuisine to that of Javiers on the strip. My brother who does not like flan loved their flan. He was impressed. If the speed could match the food then they would get 5 stars. Hopefully they read this and learn how they can improve. Not asking for lightning bolt service but drinks are important to get to the table and refilling the chip basket is a cherry on top. I recumbent trying them out and Do not be deceived by the blue sapphire sign. Wink wink.",

    "text": "Yummy food that's organic AND available 24/7!!!   I first came to El Dorado because of all of the billboards that say \"organic Mexican food.\" At first glance, my expectations were pretty low. I mean, come on...it's attached to a freakin strip club and it's open 24 hours. When I think of restaurants that are open 24/7, I immediately expect the food to be similar to the caliber of Dennys.   Wow, was I wrong! I can't say that they serve authentic Mexican food, because the food I ate in Mexico was definitely not as pretty and did not have as much variety as El Dorado has. El Dorado has managed to find the midpoint between authentic Mexican cuisine and healthy. I don't know how else to explain it. It's simply healthier Mexican food. One of the bartenders explained to me that the entire restaurant is 80% organic. I also love that they offer so many veggie options. I've tried a lot of their menu, but my two favorites are the Chicken Tinga Tostadas and the Veggie Burrito. My boyfriend is a big meat eater and he ALWAYS orders the veggie burrito because it truly is THAT good. Of course their tableside guacamole is a must as well! Most of their entrees come with beans and cilantro rice...OH EM GEE....the cilantro rice is sooooo addicting. I'm drooling right now just thinking of it. It really should be called butter rice because that is the more prominent flavor, but I guess cilantro sounds cooler.   Depending on what time you go, you may see some drunken idiots on occasion. I look at these occurrences as free entertainment, but the staff is usually really good at diluting situations before they become too much of a nuisance.",

If you like Margaritas, the restaurant boasts a wide selection of sweet, hot, or traditional margaritas. I would say that I've tried almost every margarita, but I can't keep up - as the menu changes seasonally with delicious choices. Today I tried the Jalisco Lemonade- which is my favorite (until next time)!   The complementary chips and salsa are a great start!  For starters - I suggest the queso fundito! It's incredible and filling - with lots of flavor.  As a pescatarian - I can't recommend the cactus tacos enough ! The crispy cheese and guac are so so good !  I also almost always order the Mexican Corn - as it's my favorite side dish ! Charred corn with a Mexican touch - what's not to love ?   As for what else I've tried - pretty much everything !  I recommend the table-side guac (I prefer it spicy!) for groups  to share (or if you love guac)! Even the salmon dinner is delish!   Tonight, I am even trying the Flan ( the chef's grandma's recipe? Can they adopt me?)   Finally, the service here is always phenomenal! I've never had a bad meal or bad service! El Dorado- it's worth every second !",

Love the exterior with the cool Dias de Los Muertos skull painting and the decor inside was equally as appealing & comfy. Hostess Emily was friendly and even gave us coupons for our next visit when she found out we were locals. Our server Erica was helpful with our lunch selections and her service was attentive. We both had tacos, mine were chicken and hers veggie accompanied for an additional charge with black beans and rice. Chicken tacos were good, presentation a bit spartan, I thought a bit of crema and some avocado would have gone a long way. She enjoyed her veggie tacos and we were both pleased that the rice which looked boringly white was really tasty. Black beans were okay but the chips and salsas were delicious, both green and red. We were going to share dessert and couldn't decide which and settled upon the tree leches cake though Erica said the flan was best my dining mate isn't fond of flan. So to my delight, Erica brought us one of each at no charge. She was correct, the flan was the best I've ever had hands down and the tres leches was dry and more like a cupcake, not at all as I've had it many times in many other places. Get the damn flan! It won't disappoint. I'm looking forward to coming back for a Mexican breakfast here again soon.",

The entrance is before the club but, they share the parking lot.  We were greeted immediately and led to our table. Valerie was our attentive server, who was ready for our questions and also gladly took some substitutions on my order. El Dorado Cantina did not disappoint. Delicious,organic GMO free selections from a great varied menu. The cilantro rice is to die for as well as the Seafood enchilada stuffed with shrimp, scallops and Mahi Mahi . We also had the cheese enchiladas and pork burrito. Everything done perfectly. The manager checked on us twice and we could not be more pleased. If you check in on Yelp, you get a free serving of Chef Paco's Flan! So delicious. When he came out after we were finished dining, he said the recipe was his Mother's. Not sure I should share but, he also told us that as locals, there are 50% off specials on Mondays. Be sure to make a reservation as it gets really busy. They also post special events on Facebook, like the March on Monsanto 5/23. Follow them on Facebook and you can be up to date! My new favorite Mexican restaurant. Food, varied selection and service were all 5 Star!",

I turned over every rock and stone, in hunt for carne asada, fajitas, even a mere pablano pepper. Unfortunately, my search was unsuccessful and I craved a delicious, authentic cantina style feast. As soon as I retuned to my home in Vegas, my friends told me about this place and we made reservations. Upon ordering, Amber was there to answer any inquiries of the large menu. She quickly brought chips and three tasty salsas. We were extremely impressed with her impeccable service and kindness. She made us fresh guacamole at our table, the best in Las Vegas. I ordered carne asada tacos with black beans and cilantro rice. It was robust in flavor, and the steak cooked perfectly. My craving for authentic cantina style food was quenched. Then, we learned of we check in to yelp, Executive Chef Paco will serve us flan. He shared with us that it's his grandmother's recipe. Chef Paco, thank you for working so hard to bring Las Vegas the BEST gourmet Mexican food. Your dedication and warm hearted greeting left us with the best impression and first recommendation of El Dorado Cantina.    Monday's are 25 percent off for locals. Get your ass in here!",

    "text": "HIGHER PRICES & SMALLER SHRIMP!  We have had many 5 star meals here but some of the recent changes don't bode well for the future. Recently they raised their menu prices 25 to 50% and cut portions as well the quality of some ingredients. Pretty ballsy to do both at the same time and I am not sure it will accomplish what they want; which is to make a profit. I can no longer recommend El Dorado Cantina at full menu prices, however some of the discounts and promotions are still good.  NOW THE FOOD! It is outstanding, before the changes I would have said the best Mexican food in Las Vegas. The Shrimp Taquitos were fabulous with the larger shrimp and still good with the smaller ones. The shrimp and steak Fajitas are very good but they have cut the portion and raised the price from $20 to $28; now you get less steak and 3 small shrimp instead of 4 large ones.   I'm going to go ahead and recommend the following dishes even though I have not tried them since they started making changes: Cochinita & Carnitas in tacos or the dinner, Carne Asada,  Fried Huachinango (sadly now off the menu), Cilantro Garlic Shrimp, Tropical Mahi, Huevos Divorciados, Queso Fundido, Gorditas with pulled chicken, Tres Leches Cake, and the sublime Chile Relleno.  I love Cheese Enchiladas but they really SUCK here. Do not order them they are not good. The cheese is not melted properly, the sauce is OK but there isn't enough of it to make them moist. The Shrimp Cocktail used to be great but is now way too sweet. Not quite the restaurant that it was or could have been but probably worth a try with a discount.",

The others in our group had fajitas and two specialty dishes I don't recall the name of but both were really happy. For dessert we tried the flan, tres leches, churros, and fried ice cream. Hands down, fried ice cream was amazing. We could have easily done two. The flan was probably one of the best flans we have ever had. The churros were good but the ice cream was better. Tres leches had to much liquor. Only reason giving four stars instead of five is our waitress was great most of the time, but during the first part she was like a ghost. All in all this place is a must try!",

Hands down the best Mexican food I've ever eaten! Chips and salsa to start and you can taste the natural. The queso fundido was so fresh I have no words! We shared a carnitas taco plate and it was amazing! I've never been a fan of flan but Chef Paco brought one out for us and let me tell you not only can he sing but he makes a mean flan. A MEAN FLAN! This is definitely a place for all! I can't wait for my next visit! Excuse me there is one more carnitas taco and she's looking at me weird. I gotta handle my business!",

We asked for flour tortillas instead of corn, they waitress said it would be $1 up charge and we agreed... not realizing it was $1 per taco! SO that was $9 added to our check. Then we asked for a little more sour cream, also $1 added to our check. In the end lunch was $76 plus tip for 3 people. For tacos I feel this is just too much.  We went because a friend wanted to meet there for lunch and we are new to town. The food was good enough, the salsa was the best. We would go back except I don't like being charged for every change or added condiment. I don't mind paying more for really good food, but this was not a $90 lunch. :-(",

    "text": "My first visit was on a thursday night at 10 pm. Me and the wifey came in and got seated right away. As we looked over the menu were happily munching on the bottomless chips and salsa they gave us which were complimentary. I kid you not, by the time our server came to take our order we were already working on our second basket of chips! Damn you good tasting chips and salsa! Also, damn you servers who are constantly walking by refilling the chips and salsa! We both agreed to share a meal since we definitely overdid it on the chips.  What we ordered was the the Steak n Chicken Mixed Fajita Platter ($25). It has sliced green, red, and yellow bell peppers along with sliced onions. The shrimp were some pretty sized good chunks. The cut up pieces of steak were tender and very juicy. If you just sat down and get a whiff of this dish as the server walks by you, that alone will pretty much entice you to order it. Comes with a plate of sour cream, guacamole, pico de gallo, and your choice of black or refried beans. You also get either flour or corn tortillas. Im glad we shared it for we barely finished it! We finished up with a free flan as the special for checking in on Yelp. For you peeps with a sweet tooth, this dessert is rich.  Our second visit we decided to go on a monday to take advantage of the locals 50 percent off on the entire menu. We were strongly recommended to make a reservation for you just might wait awhile before a table opens up.  As we showed up for our 7 pm reservation, the place was packed! People were waiting to be seated but not us. We proceeded to our table right away. We wanted to try different things so being the carnivore that I am, I went with the Carne Asada plate ($26) and wifey went with the Conchinita Pibill ($24). I was also curious about the Mexican Corn ($5) so we got that as well. For dessert, we got the Flan ($8).  This time we kind of went easy on the chips and salsa so we can make a dent in our individual meals. Again, we were wrong. We could of shared just one meal and still be fully satisfied. Oh well, my oldest son could not have been happier when we brought home the leftovers!  The Carne Asada they give you 2, that's right, two nicely sized marinated skirt steaks. Comes with a scoop of some type of steamed buttered rice (no, its not like rice pilaf) guacomole, and your choice of refried or black beans. But wait, there's more. You also get a grilled jalapeno and another grilled type of red pepper. They even give you some kind of pork sausage as well. The steak I requested medium rare and it was spot on! It was perfectly seasoned with whatever marinade they use. I can even taste a hint of lime in it. It is some of the best asada I have had in a long time.  The Conchinita Pibill was highly recommended by our server Amber. She said it was one of favorite pork dishes. It is basically carnitas but with some different spices. It was so tender and juicy that I was alternating from my plate to hers.  The Mexican Corn (elote), is a roasted corn on the cobb coated with mayonaise, queso fresco, and sprinkle of cayenne powder. Comes with a couple of slices of lime for you to squeeze on to it.  To complete our meal we got the flan again since we know that it is very good. Now remember this second visit we only paid 35 dollars instead of 70 and we still had plenty of leftovers  Service. As luck would have it, we ended up getting the same server as last time which was Amber. Now she is very efficient. Not only does she serve other tables, but she is always looking at our table to see if we needed anything that was commonly asked. She did this every time she walked by carrying other customers' orders. All her other co-servers did their part by picking up empty plates as they walked by. Not once did I ask for a refill on our waters and sodas at all both visits. Now that is great service.  Some random useful info. Besides what I mentioned above, they are 24 hours, They have numerous GMO free and organic menu options not to mention gluten free and organic items as well. Oh, did I mention that they are right next to Sapphire, one of largest strip clubs in Vegas? Guys (and gals) how many times have you gone to a strip club but had to leave later on because you were starving? Yeah, I know makin it rain on them strippers makes me hungry too. Just do the hokey pokey and turn yourself around. Just like that you are feasting on great Mexican food no matter what time of day it is. They even have giant flat screen tv's strewn all around the restaurant so you dont miss the \"big\" game if it so applies. Sometimes, the master chef Paco will be walking around making sure everything is ok. Dude is very friendly.  In closing, even though they opened just last year, I am still mad at myself for not checking them out sooner. I cant wait for my next meal here and I will definitely let other foodies know!

Two seperate buildings that share one common wall.  It looks like liberace may have decorated the place after a trip to mexico. Vibrant red walls combine with more traditional mexican lighting accents. The food here is fantastic but kind of expensive. So come on taco tuesday when margaritas are cheap and tacos are only $3.50. Some places offer cheap margarita specials on tue or happy hour but the glass is half the size of their regular margarita. Not here at el dorado. The margarita is full size and the tacos r the same. Our waitress was perfect.  This can b a fun place to people watch. It's got that old school vegas feel to it and a wide variety of people can be found here.",

Quality service is non existent / food is good - specials are good ...  service is literally...  non... existent.  10 min later and we had asked to order - still waited another 5 - I think we don't know her well enough - she's serving everyone around us in excess so maybe we are not that cool. I dunno. I'll try harder ? Someone here should.   Turned out she wouldn't start a check for us because she was supposed to be off already. How do we know that? Cuz she was talking loudly across the bar about it. Boh issues should stay there and not be part of the guest 'experience'.   Happy Eating to you!",

Once we had to remind the guy server (during the day during the week) that we ordered guac. He looked put off like he didn't want to to it.  Both times our rice was cold. My husband said he will never go back. I agree, the food didn't taste the same, was barely warm and bland.  Also I will not go back here because an ex employee told me that their chips are not NONGMO anymore and the owner/manager cuts corners and buys regular produce and items that are GMO to save money.  Cute place inside, it's a shame to hear the business is going south.   :[",

We've been to a lot of Mexican restaurants and this is one of the best.  We ordered the red sangria, table side guacamole, albondigas soup, butter lettuce wrapped steak tacos and the most delicious octopus with chorizo tacos. As a bonus we were offered a complimentary flan for checking in on yelp, which was AMAZING.  Truly a delicious experience. My hubby is a Mexican and his mother is an amazing cook, so he's bias, he said this was one of his all time favorite meals and wants to come back tomorrow.  I can't argue and will happily come back.  I can see us coming here every time we are in Vegas.",

We got the Spiegel plate, side of guac, corn, a house margarita and a glass of wine and it was $62. A bit pricey, especially considering the chicken was barely edible very chewy. The steak was alright, better than the chicken, but not great. When it came out the meat was luke warm. And we were pretty much done with the dish by the time my side of corn arrived. The rice was really good, so was the side of corn but for the price I didn't find the value.",

My lady and I came and it never stopped being top notch. Jose the waiter, super. Chips and salsa, right on. Margaritas, clean and tight. Table side guac, F to the yes. Veggie enchiladas, tube-tacular.  Cedar plank chipotle salmon, dying now. Cilantro rice, shockingly tasty. Chef Paco came and visited us bc I was dancing to the amazing Selena concert they were playing, and had them bring us a flan. As I said, it was...FLANtastic! (Well, that was my gals phrase).   And it's open 24 HOURS!?!? There's no excuse to have sub par Mexican food EVER.   THEY TOOK US TO FUNKYTOWN (and I can't wait to go back!!!)",

I read great things on Yelp before coming, so the location next to the strip club was not surprising. And I definitely agree with the reviews that state that patrons should not be deterred by location.   We had a 9:00 pm dinner reservation and we arrived a little early. Our table was not yet ready so the hostess escorted us to the bar. The bartender was really helpful in suggesting drinks, especially when the one I contained items that were out of stock. Some people mentioned that the drinks were expensive, each is around $12, but being from DC this feels pretty routine for me, and in Vegas the price is fair.   We were seated promptly after receiving our drinks. We had a nice booth in the main dining room. Our server was so nice and very on top of all of his tables. We ordered the table side guac as an appetizer. I highly recommend it. I am a huge fan of Mexican food and I always order table side guac, and this was the best one I have had to date! I ordered the street tacos (1 pulled chicken and 2 carne asada) and they were amazing. Initially the portion size seemed small but I definitely walked away feeling full! Rice is an extra charge with the meal, but totally worth it.   The service was great, the food was great and the drinks were delicious. I highly recommend this place. It is hands down the best Mexican I have ever had!",

I was scared of the place knowing it was in the building of Sapphires, but when you go inside, you are defiantly in a separate place.  The staff is friendly and makes sure you are taken care of well, the service was some of the best ever. Drinks stayed full, needs were met and the speed of service was amazing.  The food was beyond expectation even for a 5 star restaurant. The chef even came out to the table to see how things were going and if the food met expectations. He was happy to hear that the food and service were equally exceptional.  The Manager checked on us several times and wanted to make sure as guests we were happy with the service and food.  The drinks were mixed well and portioned correctly to make the taste and the intoxicating feelings overwhelm, perfection of drink blending for sure.  I am giving a 5 star and hope anyone else who goes here enjoys the service as much as I did.",

Fortunately, you'll find this right next to the front entrance of the Sapphires Strip club. However you wanna play it (Eat first, then play-- or play first, then eat), you can't go wrong.   I ate light since it was late. So I just got the ELOTE and the CORN RAJAS TACOS. Of course, the elote will never be like the elotes on the streets, but it was close enough! I could've eaten five of them. I did like this because it wasn't as rich. Not too much butter/mayo. Just enough chili and cheese, and that char grilled flavor is everything.  CORN RAJAS TACOS were amazing. Those poblano peppers really pack a punch in flavor. You get 2, but in all honesty the tacos were very hearty so even one will fill you fast. Well, maybe not for someone with a big appetite.  My friend got the EL DORADO MARGARITA and it was pretty delicious when I tried it, I almost drank his whole drink (oops). Could barely taste the alcohol--which could really be dangerous.   VENUE: dim lighting in there with fairly hip/ Firefly setting. Of course, you'll see the club goers and industry folks come in and out to dine, which is always a fun setting.   Lastly, ++++ points for being a non GMO restaurant. We always want good quality food with a little less guilt attached to it.",

If it weren't for the kindness and customer service skills of the general manager, I would have given El Dorado's 1 star. We came on Monday around 7PM, on locals night. As many others have attested, this restaurant is kind of hard to find. Parking was extremely crowded (Sapphire's must be a popular strip club). My husband eventually spotted the entrance and we walked right in. We were seated immediately and our waiter greeted us in no time. So far, so good, right?   We were automatically given two glasses of water and chips and salsa. The water tasted gross and dirty. After one sip, I pushed it to the side. The chips and salsa were okay. The waiter recommended some kind of fruit infused water and then walked away. Hey, what about my drink order? I grew thirstier and thirstier after munching on chips and salsa while waiting on our waiter to come back. Finally, he returned and instead of taking our drink order, asks if we've decided on what to eat. Fine. I ordered the cheese enchiladas ($9.50), with a Coke please. My husband ordered Steak al Cilantro ($26.50).   The food came out pretty quickly, but the visual presentation for both our entrees was seriously lacking. The cheese on my enchiladas looked like it had been sitting out for a while. The red sauce looked and tasted like it came from a can. I am a mediocre cook at best, and I could have made better enchiladas.The rice was bland and flavorless and was NOT Mexican rice by my standards. The refried beans tasted too meaty. The enchiladas were lackluster but I ate them anyways. Sigh.       My poor husband's steak looked like slop. According to the menu, the steak was \"topped\" with green tomatillo sauce. My ass. That shit was drenched in it. My husband said all he could taste was that sauce. Other words he used to describe his meal were \"worst steak in my life\" and \"the first bite was pure fat that I chewed for 5 minutes\". Needless to say, he sent it back.   Our waiter had gone MIA and never bothered to check on us after dropping off the food. The general manager is the one who actually checked on us and sent back the plate. She was totally cool about the whole thing. She recommended  the Cochinita pork tacos ($9.50), so he went with that.   In the meantime, we were also waiting on refills. The waiter was still missing. When the GM returned with the pork tacos, we asked HER if we could get refills. My husband said the pork tacos were just okay.    At this point, we couldn't wait to get out of there. The waiter with the disappearing act returned to clear our plates and get us our check. The final bill was a shockingly low $12.97, but that's still overpriced if I don't like the food. The manager was a sweetheart and gave me her card to let her know if I would be coming in again and if I had any comments for her. While I appreciate this gesture, we will not be returning. The food and service (the waiter) were plain bad. I was also disappointed in the so-called plethora of vegetarian options I read about in reviews. El Dorado's has the same options as any other Mexican restaurant, so don't get your hopes up.",

Very large portions, it was a very nice dish.  The desserts were extraordinay. Flan was brought out by the chef himself , who told the story of how it is his grandmother's family recipe.  Will go back for sure. It is open 24 hours. Don't be put off by the fact that it is in the same parking lot as a strip club. Once you are inside the restaurant you will not know the difference.  Classy and upscale interior and great service. The wait staff knew to ask about ingredients and all the food is non GMO, if that is important to you . Highly recommended.",

This place was an utter delight the second we walked in.The decor rivals anything any of the casinos can offer. We were seating promptly, with a smile, to a huge round booth.We felt truly welcomed immediately.  Then our waitress came out beaming with positive energy and took our drink order. I ordered an Iced Tea, which was great, and in a big glass. Wifey wanted water, as we had already had our fill of alcohol our short Vegas jaunt.  She returned with chips that were purple, and served with 3 different types of salsa. We were warned about the spiciness of the orange habanero salsa, but it wasnt so bad. We enjoyed it. The salsa verde was good. But we devoured the delicious red salsa casera, which was quickly noticed and refilled. Awesome.  We shared a chicken Gordita plate as an appetizer. They came out smaller than we expected. No worries though, we enjoyed them. Very good.  Wifey ordered the Carne Asada Nachos. They came out with great presentation, and plenty of meat. All the fixins. They took Nachos to another level. Portion was big enough to share.  I had a Carna Asada Burrito. I would place this Burrito in the top 10 all-time Carne Asada burritos ever. I found myself eating slowly to savor the goodness. Fantastic.  Chef Paco came out to greet us, and thank us for our patronage. We showered him with compliments and thanked him for making us such delectable food. What a nice, geniune Hombre.  We recieved complimentary Flan for checking in on my phone. My Wife has HATED Flan since childhood, and reluctantly tried some. SHE LOVED IT! Because this is the worlds greatest Flan! No joke, this is the best Flan either of us have ever had BAR NONE. If you try it, try to incorporate some of the mint leaf into your bite, it adds a little extra to the indulgence.  This restaurant has earned our loyalty, and we will be coming here every time we are in town. We rather enjoyed the adventure in finding this place, and dont mind the strip club next door. If you dont like strippers, you shouldnt be in Las Vegas.  Well done guys",

Started with tableside guacamole from our awesome server mark. It was honestly delicious, followed by a couple more appetizers which were also to die for I especially enjoyed the quest fundido.  We decided to go for a family style meal and just get a bunch of stuff and share, first off the portions are awesome, and the street tacos delicious. We had cochinita which I thought was AMAZING and that's saying alot being from Mexico City which is also where chef Paco was from so I could really identify myself with this menu that brought back nostalgia of the cooking from my home city.   Overall rating of my experience was superb. To top it all off we had dessert. Churros is what we opted for since it was easy to share but flan was really where my heart was. This is the chefs recipe passed down from his grandmother and I don't say this often but he gives my mothers flan a run for its money.   Top this all off with awesome locals, industry discount plus a happy hour and you got yourself a winner. Chef Paco and Mark our waiter really go out of there way to make sure your dining experience is great. For this you have my business on which I'm sure will be the first of many visits to this awesome place.",

Ingredients are so fresh with a great kick of tequila. Their chips comes with three types of salsa - mild, verse and hot (the hot is habanero so take little dips on that one) as well as beans. You could snack on those for hours!  Now to the fun part, the entrees. I HIGHLY recommend the Carne Asada Burrito. Seriously, it will give you life! It's packed with amazing steak, rice, black beans and guac, all rolled up in a beautiful tortilla. It also comes with a side of cilantro rice. I'm not a huge fan of cilantro but it was definitely good.  I have also tried their street-style tacos and their fajitas are huge. All made with the freshest ingredients!  Make sure to say hello to Chef Paco as he likes to make his rounds and say hello to his guests.  Seriously, one of the best places in Vegas - hands down! :)",

The bathrooms were dirty and it stunk back in the hallway like old fish. Turned me off so bad.  We got a spicy Margarita and it was so sweet we both were puckering up. We sent it back and they remade it. This place shares a parking lot with a strip club so when bringing your kids they may ask some questions lol be prepared for that. Service was good except we asked if they honor a military discount with they do. Handed our ID over to the waitress and she took it to the manager. He then came back after running our card with the copy and said have a good night. No discount? So we called him back and he was like oh I must of given it to someone else lol so he had to redo it and the original charge is still on there so hopefully that gets fixed by tomorrow. Overall I would save my money and go get street tacos from a vendor.  Ohhhh also we wanted to get the ghost pepper Salsa because we love ghost pepper but it's  $20!!! For salsa. No thanks",

I can only sum up that people who rate this place with high marks have probably never had better. Nothing here was made fresh (which is what makes Mexican food so authentic and good). The drinks were okay, nothing exceptional or unique. I ordered an ice tea. It was instant. The tea was so old that the preservatives had worn off and had a foul smell that left a taste in your mouth that I can only liken to methane. I ordered the Tropical Mahi entree. The rice was the best part of the dish. The fish was rubbery, and so bad I didn't finish it. The chips aren't made fresh and neither is the salsa. They had tres leches on the dessert menu, but I couldn't suffer through any more disappointment. This place needs Gordon Ramsey to come in and hit the do-over button.",

    "text": "First off, do NOT let the location fool you and do NOT be fooled by it's location! This places shares the parking lot/building with a gentlemen's club, SERIOUSLY!  When we pulled up, I was like, \"Wait! Is this place inside the titty bar?!?!? I mean like tacos & titties?!?!?\" But I quickly realized that there are two very separate entrances. I mean, I may be Gay and all, but I am NOT opposed to tacos & titties!! However, it did throw me off for a quickness! Anyways, back to my experience with them. Once you get over joking around with the hostess regarding the location, to which she was a champ at; I assumed she's had this dialogue before. She was super sweet and awesome, and very attentive. Our server came over rather quickly and she was super friendly, sweet and nice. She laughed a lot whit us while we were there. They weren't terribly busy, however it was nice to have someone so pleasant taking care of us.  As for our food. We started off with guacamole, which they make to order at your table. It was fresh, it was good it was just missing some salt. One of us ordered the shredded beef enchiladas and they were tasty, it was missing a little something something in the flavor department as well as the seafood enchiladas as someone else ordered in our party. The base of the each plate was there, like you taste that they could have been SUPER tasty, however they were missing just that one little flavor to make them POP! However, they were good. I ordered the chicken nachos, I'm kind of a sucker for finger foods! The chicken was super tasty and tender. The chips were great! The nachos overall, were perfect. I also ordered a jalapeno margarita which was YUMMY! Although, they attached 3/4 of a jalapeno to the side of the glass, which was a bit of an overkill, but the drink was YUMMY! My only downside, I judge a lot of Mexican places by their beans. And their beans were a bit off. They needed to be refried just a bit more and smoothed out. However, keep in mind they refry them in animal lard, just like the way you're suppose too!!  One thing I won't lie to you about is the price. It is on the pricier side of things especially for lunch. I mean my margarita alone was like $12 and entrees were about $12 and up, not to say they didn't have less expensive items, but the entrees were in the low teens and up. So be prepared to eat and spend if you go for lunch. We noticed that they had a lot of happy hour specials, like on Wed they offer free tequila and then their daily one from 5pm-11pm looks like they had some GREAT specials! Definitely will keep this on my \"let's try again list\" and want to go back for their Happy Hour treats! Plus, service was great. Again, just don't let the titty bar next to them fool ya!!",

We ordered table side guacamole first, which was prepared (no surprise here) table side. It was delicious and fresh. I ordered a shrimp bowl, which was so filling and also very tasty. We got a free flan for checking in on Yelp and we also ordered churros, which finished our meal beautifully. The chef came by as we were finishing and made sure everything was to our liking, which it was. Our group is from out of state, but we would definitely come back if we were in the area and I recommend it to anyone!",

I brought several friends down at different times and so far nothing but amazing feedback.  Some of the salsas are very hot, so be careful with those.  The atmosphere is more like an upscale bar at a casino.  Because this place is so good, it's literally ruined all other Mexican restaurants for me. If I'm not able to go here and have the misfortune of settling for another Mexican restaurant, I'm always disappointed. Yum!",

The deals for locals was really good as well.  The server was very friendly and although there were some issues with the bill, it was quickly resolved without question.  I was definitely ready to call this a regular spot, but the experience was overshadowed by the OUTSIDE experience.  Firstly, as others have mentioned, it's difficult to find.  We drove to the south entrance, and was directed where to go by the attendant.  After being honked at by the various strip club clientele, we made our way to the front of the building.    Parking was plenty and easy to find, but it's still shared with the strip club.  That also meant a visit from a golf-cart parking lot attendant, telling us we couldn't hang around there.  We had finished our meal with friends and were chatting for about 5 minutes, had the parking lot attendant attendant give us the \"you can't hang around here\" response, which we responded with a \"we're just talking with our friends\", which then resulted in a \"excuse me?  what was that?\" (ie, 'are you questioning my authority?'). Fine we get it.    We wrapping up our goodbyes, however, that was cut short as the guy came back with a cart full of a couple girls 2 minutes later and actually almost hit my friend.  I guess - what - as a warning?  Great.  I now don't want to come back to a hidden gem of a restaurant, because some parking attendant had a power trip.  Why subject yourself to low-class harassment when you could just...go somewhere else.",

They make it fresh right at your table. The flan was delicious as well (chefs grandmothers recipe). All their food is organic and tastes fresh. There are 3 other sit down Mexican restaurants in our area. We have visited them only once and never gone back. We used to go to one until they increased their prices $4 an entree. I'm glad as a dtlv resident there's something close by that has great tasting Mexican food with good prices. We will be back again for sure! Monday's they offer 50% off for locals.",

Came here in locals night, so our entire bill was 25% off and they let us combine that with the Yelp check in offer for the Free flan, which was incredible tasting and I am not a Flan fan in the slightest. But I am getting ahead of myself.  My date made a reservation for 5:00 pm on Monday, Locals Night, where locals get 25% off their total bill, they also have a happy hour that runs from 4 to 6 that I want to try out. It was fairly dead when we got there, secret tip from me to you have dinner between 5 and 5:30 most restaurants have low business at that time. We were seated right away, my date had already had a gin and tonic since he was early and he was raving about the gin. Our server greeted us promptly and had a bunch of suggestions for us, we ended up taking her appetizer suggestion but not the entree, we got the Aguachiles, which was their answer to ceviche, it was good. Not super spicy though you could tell it wanted to be, apparently it's usually very spicy and we must have gotten a weak batch? Oh well.   For our entree we got the beef and chicken fajitas to share and they were delightful, you get a mountain of peppers and onions and an all right portion of meat, a DELICIOUS cilantro rice, now I don't eat rice as a rule, but this was fantastic, came in a cute little shape as well. We also got rice, guac, and sour cream. The food was excellent.   We finished with the best Flan I've ever had in my life. I pretty much hate flan. It's flavorless gelatin to me, I try it every time I'm with someone who gets it and it usually reaffirms my dislike, but this flan was ALMOST a caramel cheesecake, it was insane and I would go back just to eat that flan again. As we were wrapping up dessert the chef came out and chatted with us a bit and gave us a coupon for their breakfast. Apparently this place is 24 hours, so crazy!  I know I'll be back there to try their Happy Hour, I love street tacos and I want to see how their stack up! All around a GREAT meal at a GREAT restaurant.",

You can tell that they are extremely understaffed, It took the waiter about 15 minutes to come greet us and then another 15 minutes for me to get the margarita I had ordered. Also, the drink must have spilled a bit on the way to my table because there was more salt running down the sides of my glass then there was on the rim.  As for the food... The salsas that went with the chips were pretty tasty, we devoured them waiting for our food and asked for more chips that never arrived. I ordered the chicken fajitas, and they weren't bad but it was nothing to rave about. My bf ordered the street tacos that our waiter had recommended and he also wasn't impressed. For dessert we got the free flan after we checked in and we also ordered fried ice cream on top of that. Once again another 15-20 minute wait! By that point we just wanted to leave but we couldn't because our server was no where to be found even 10 minutes after we had finished eating dessert...  As I said, the food wasn't terrible, but the service was and that most likely put a damper on the whole experience for us. We most likely won't be back :(",

The chicken wings were okay but I will give them credit for the chips and salsa. They were free and fresh. The best part was the sangria's otherwise the decor is cheap and I must mention it's right next door to a strip club. It basically looks like one inside as well. Red velvet walls with an awkward layout. There were allot of guys in there so I'm guessing they eat then head to the strip club next door. They are open 24 hours so they are working that card. I was hoping by the other reviews it would be great but it was not.",

Thought I was in the wrong place at first when I pulled into the Sapphire parking lot, haha, and was a little worried about what I would find.  Turns out - what I would find was a really chic restaurant with delicious food.  The service is ok, I haven't been blown away by any of the servers (but the service wasn't bad either) - but both times I've visited thus far, Chef Paco has come out to introduce himself and thank us for our patronage.  It's really nice when Management takes an interest in their guests like that.  Now we do Margarita Mondays at El Dorado.  Mondays are 50% off everything for locals.  The house margarita is made w/ good clear tequila (not some cuervo crap like most places).  You can get a pitcher (which is normally $32) for $16!  Two of us got 2.5 margaritas out of the pitcher.  So $3 per delicious organic margarita?!  Yup, I'm sold!  You can also add some organic fruit to your drink for a little more.  The food is fantastic as well.  The shrimp tacos were the bomb, my friend had a dish where the shrimp was served in 1/2 a pineapple.  Amazing presentation and soooo good.  The flan is TO DIE FOR.  Seriously, try it!  If it's your first time, you get a free flan when you check on Yelp.  Mondays have gotten really popular now w/ the 50% off for locals deal, so I would recommend a reservation.  PS - they have plenty of vegetarian options and are happy to make these items vegan upon request.",

Our bartender Omar was very attenative, and I never had to ask for a drink refill or chip/salsa refill (he just refilled it without me having to say anything).   I had some amazing chicken tacos. Their food is organic, non-GMO, and free range. If you are a vegetarian or a vegan, there is stuff on the menu for you.  For dessert, I recommend the churros, fried ice cream, or the flan (all of which are to die for). I'm not kidding, I love churros, and when I go to Disneyland that is one of my favorite things about the place, but these churros were even better than Disneyland's!  To me the price is very affordable, and I hear that they are half off (everything) on Mondays, so I plan on returning to try the rest of the desserts out ;).",

There location is right next door to a strip club so I think they may have recruited some of their employees.   As soon as we were seated the chips were brought out. I like a Mexican restaurant where they bring out the chips before you have to ask. The chips were a mix of blue and yellow. I found this very tacky especially because they claim to be an \"upscale\" Mexican restaurant. I was not thrilled with any of the salsas, in particular the yellow one which had no flavor only heat. I ordered the albondigas soup, lettuce wraps, and steak & shrimp fajita platter. The broth of the soup was subtly seasoned but the vegetables in the soup were cut sloppily, and the meatball was dry and flavorless. Accompanying the soup was a pile of chips, why would I need more chips when you give unlimited baskets of chips? The lettuce wraps were difficult to eat because the guacamole was on the bottom making the lettuce wrap bottom heavy. Guacamole tasted like mashed up avocados with no type of seasoning. The fajita platter looked like a typical fajita platter. The guacamole was flavorless and the sour cream was so runny that I doubt it's homemade. Steak was well cooked albeit salty and the shrimp were jumbo in size but not deveined. And once again, the black beans were garnished with a chip.   I can't see why this is considered an upscale Mexican restaurant except for the decor.",

Our plates had small cups of palate neutralizing acidic vegetables to accent the flavors between succulent bites.   noteworthy.   Wife ordered two lemon drop martinis.  Both were clearly made with margarita mix.  Either lazy bartender or our order was miscommunicated.  Wife didn't want to make a stink.  I would have. A 14 dollar lemon drop needs to be made with lemons. Not cheap margarita mix.   Weird entrance virtually shared with a gentlemans club.  Building surrounded with ghetto lighting and ghetto music. I would not have come here if it were not for the great good reviews   Thanks Yelp.   Don't let the exterior chase you away.   I suspect the owner is related to the club owner. Thus the weird entrance.   I'll return.  Five stars dinged to four due to the worst excuse for a  Mixed drink I've ever seen.  It'd be ok at a cheap grease spoon.  Not this gourmet Mexican place.",

The healthiest Mexican food I've ever had, hands down. Chips and salsa were good. They have three salsas; the habanero is amazing. I had the strawberry agua fresca, (they have a different flavor each day), it was refreshing and not overly sweetened, perfect flavor. Their coffee is rich and freshly brewed. Portions are pretty big, my boyfriend and I shared Paco's Mole Sampler. The chile verde chicken is to die for. The cilantro rice was THE BEST rice I've ever had---full of flavor and so deliciously soft. The refried beans had a nice spice. At this point in time, I was already satisfied. Our server then told us that if we check in on Yelp, we'll get a complimentary dessert...the flan. Okay let me just say that I was never too crazy about flan. I've always liked it, but I've never crazed over it. Now let me say that I have been waiting over 12 hours to properly describe this flan in hopes that my words do it justice. IT WAS THE BEST FLAN I HAVE EVER PUT IN MY MOUTH. I wanted to cry after the second bite, it was so good. I was so happy. I have never tasted anything so freakin' delicious. My exact words to my boyfriend were \"I want you to look at me the way I look at this flan.\" Honestly, words fail when it comes to this flan. There are no words. Get the flan. Your life will never be complete until you have had this flan.",

We were thrilled with the crickets and jalapeno margaritas. Staff seemed scattered tonight, and the new manager was present but pretty much not engaging with customers a lot. A few times my husband attempted to wave for assistance and got the eyes- averted skillfully response. We had the lettuce wraps with marinated steak, the appetizer which is like spicy shrimp ceviche, and the Tinga tostidas. Food was good. Drinks were very slow. Our server was ok but seemed new and maybe was a bit hesitant explaining things to us. Not enough to keep us from returning but the evening staff on duty at 6pm were somewhat disconnected I felt. We will consider this an off night for them but because we are fans of their non GMO and fresh ingredients will continue to like the place.",

As we were getting the check the chef came out to talk to us, and when we shared our disappointment he actually told us that the grasshoppers were still being served as an off-menu item. They have two flavors, garlic lime, and habanero. We opted for the habanero and they were amazing, much to our surprise. Would come to eat here again, definitely.

He was a General Manager for the \"El Dorado\" location in Houston. The decor and painting outside were legit.  But it took a bit for someone to come over and get our drink orders. Some of us liked our margaritas but some didn't. Chips and salsa were ok. The green salsa wasn't spicy at all. We ordered our food and it finally started coming out. One person's food was cold so they had to remake it and then they forgot another person's food. I got the Aguachiles and it was pretty tasty. We were still wanting to get more drinks and possibly some dessert. The waiter took a very long time to come back over, only to bring the checks. We could have easily spent another $200 more on drinks. So we left and found another place to spend our money.",

I don't normally like jalapenos but somehow when tequila is added I'm all about it lol  El Dorado Cantina is located next to the Sapphire.  There is clearly a separate entrance into the restaurant.  El Dorado is open 24 hours and has a full menu day or night.  Locals get 25% off the entire bill on Monday's too!",

That being said, I tried a couple of my friends' left-overs and it was pretty darn good. It's an authentic Mexican restaurant with a casual yet upper scale atmosphere. No complaints at all. The staff is very fast and friendly, the Chef (Paco) came out and greeted us at the table and gave us his card! A very good experience, that I would highly recommend.",

El Dorado is the answer to your Mexican food prayers.  You can't go wrong with the cochinita meat. Put it on EVERYTHING! The flavor is outstanding and never disappoints, try the pibil. Burritos are the best I've ever had, wrapped perfectly. Salsa are so good, you'll get full off the chips if you don't watch yourself! Chef Paco puts a lot of love and heart into the food he creates and wants the world to enjoy the deliciousness. The flan and tres leeches cake are my favorite for dessert!   The staff is always very attentive and helpful, this is a key element when I want to enjoy a night out. Keep it up!  Don't let the location fool you, the restaurant is completely separate from the strip club next door. You're safe inside!",

    "text": "This will be my 4th visit to this restaurant and I finally decided to get on Yelp and write my review!       El Dorado Cantina has to be, in my opinion, the best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas for many reasons:       A certain calm, yet energetic vibe is presented as soon as you're seated. The decorative style in this restaurant is rather unique. Red cloth - like fabric is placed on the walls that shape up to what it seems to be roses, along with antiqued mirrors and quite surprisingly, a mix with modern decorations (you have to see for yourself).        The food that I ordered was outstanding. I ordered the street taco sampler. It consisted of 10 tacos, with a mixture of pork, carne asada, and chicken. I don't recall the type of pork that one of the tacos had but it had a nice spicy,  flavor to it. I believe it was called cochinitas, you'll love it.       Each taco had certain fresh vegetables to compliment it, meaning no taco (depending on the meat), had the same \"toppings.\" I believe this very important to notice because if you have gone to other Mexican restaurants, you will see some restaurants do not do this.       To summarize the flavor of the meats: WHOO! My favorite was the carne asada. It was marinated to perfection and it was juicy and tender. Oh my god, it was great. I also recommend you order the tableside guacamole to add to the tacos because, why not?       Our waiter, Enrique was professional and very courteous. He explained in detail what each flavor consisted of and happily answered any other questions my father and I had.       To top it off,  Yelp offers a free flan desert. This flan is the best flan I've ever had in my life. Seriously. Chef Paco came out to serve the flan and explained to my father the culture the restaurant lives on and it was quite interesting. I'd rather have Chef Paco explain it to you than I.  Enjoy the food here!",

But you walk in and the place is very nice, well kept, and has no smells that you'd expect.   We ordered a takeout, very large order. Overall the food came out fresh, albeit it took it about 45 minutes to make and get ready. The street tacos I ordered were as good as I've had. Then I tried the ghost chili and I was still feeling the burn two days later - very impressive dish. Don't underestimate it. The drink prices are strip value, but given that next door will cost 3x you can do worse.   El Dorado actually has that quality of a must visit in Vegas. Where else can you park in a strip club then experience great Mexican with organic and good for you quality of ingredients literally a few feet away?  I recommend a go.",

Whatever it was, it was in the 20's% discount.   Another star off for the fact that they actually charge you for extra salsa. I haven't been to a Mexican restaurant that's charged for extra in my entire life, so I was caught off guard.   The cheese enchiladas- 1 star. Oh man, it was not good at all. The red sauce was meh, the taco itself was hard, and the overall temperature of the dish was somewhat lukewarm. It just was not a good enchilada.   Carne Asada Burrito- 2 star. It was okay, and nothing special.   The chorizo queso fundido- 5 stars. It was as good as I remembered.   Overall with everything combined, my last visit determined that I will not be back for more.

    "text": "This is probably my favorite restaurant in town, so I'm not sure why it's taken me so long to write a review. I've been here at least 14 times according to my Yelp check-ins.  Always make an Open Table reservation; sometimes you need it, sometimes you don't, either way you get the 100pts from Open Table. My only complaint is that the lighting isn't conducive to taking food pics. I may of may not have purchased a foodie light just for the purpose of taking pictures here. (I did.)  My favorites:   Veggie burrito, it's on my \"last meal\" list. Make sure you order the black beans if you are a vegetarian.  Get the rice. I don't know why it is so delicious, but it is.   Al Pastor tacos- I always suggest these to out of town guests, because most of mine are from WV and have never experienced it's pork and pineapple deliciousness.   Cheese enchiladas, soooo good on the rare occasion I'm not feeling the above two items   Chilaquiles, they will sub al pastor meat if you ask nicely, and scramble the eggs for you  Free flan with Yelp check in. I love that Chef Paco brings it out if he is there. Sometimes he will even send you out special things too that aren't even on the menu. I don't like flan, but this is like a cheesecake texture, it is divine. Order it, just trust me.  Mangonada margaritas with chamoy and chile rim - not on the menu but they will make them for you if you ask. A server suggested them when I was here with friends for my birthday (actually I came here twice for my birthday last year, with two groups of friends...anyway....) and I have been obsessed ever since.   My mom loved her food so much, she and my aunt had me bring them here twice during their 5 day visit. I've never brought anyone here who didn't love their meal....the only item I've ever had that I didn't like was the short rib tacos, it was more like a Korean BBQ style short rib than a braised, shredded short rib like I was expecting. My mom was who ordered it, and the server kindly replaced it with another selection for her.   When anyone asks me where the should eat while they are in Las Vegas, I send them here, and that's the highest compliment I can provide.",

This place is a pretty pricy mexican restaurant. At first I thought this price was a little pricey for burrito but everyone told me it was a big portion. When the food came, the portion was decent and a presentation was just okay. I think a $20 worth of entree should have been a little better than what it was presented and how it was tasted. The food was just okay to me. I asked all my other coworkers and all of their food was just okay as well. I think it's little overpriced. I'm not sure if I will be coming back here again.",

Tonight I came out with a group of girlfriends and we got a pitcher of the Cadillac margarita, and it was perfect.  Three of us had the shredded chicken enchiladas, and another had a chicken fajita bowl. All of us loved our plates. The chicken was truly moist, and flavorful- not spicy, the green sauce had a zing, and the tortilla was soft. It came with 2 enchiladas, rice (cilantro infused I believe), and your choice of retried beans or black beans. At the end of our meal, Chef Paco came by to ask how everything was, and offered us dessert. We couldn't deny a recipe that came from his grandma! So we tried the flan and orange ice cream. absolutely tasty and the perfect sweet to end our meal. The flan I was impressed with the firmness and how tender it was. I don't like a super bouncy flan, so this was perfect.  We seriously cannot wait for the next visit! Thank you so much Chef Paco and everyone here at El Dorado Cantina!!!!",

Here's why:  Staff-related: I came in outside of lunch rush (2pm), and I sat for nearly 10 minutes before being greeted, despite there being at least seven servers, two runners and a manager-ish person who spoke to me when I arrived. Oddly, that gentleman sat about 10 feet away from me the entire time I waited and neither indicated to his staff that I was there nor deign to say or offer anything (e.g., menu). The server was friendly enough though I did feel rushed despite the restaurant being 90% empty.   Food wise: Carne asada tacos have long been my go-to. This time, the meat was thin and dry and flavorless, and the flour tortilla was dry around the edges, as if the entire plate sat under the heat lamp for too long.  Until today, we loved this place for its food as well as its commitment to locally-sourced and non-GMO ingredients. Maybe this was just an off day, but so many misses happened in one meal that I worry what made El Dorado so great might be gone.",

They also offered $5 Don Julio 1942, which was sooo smooth and could be my new favorite tequila!   Our server, Grace, was friendly, attentive, and worked quickly to accommodate our party of 6. She kept the chip bowl full and checked in with us frequently making sure we were taken care of.   The restaurant itself is large. They have plenty of seating available for large parties.

I just recently spent the weekend in Vegas with my friends, and before we headed back home to LA someone recommended El Dorado Cantina. The service was top notch - our drinks were constantly filled and our server was very kind and attentive. They offered complimentary chips with green and red salsa. The salsas were fantastic and tasted homemade. I couldn't decide which was better, the red or green! I ordered the shrimp burrito, which was $20. The price was pretty steep, but as soon as I took the first bite I was in love!! That was probably the best shrimp burrito I've ever had in my entire life. Don't even get me started on the cilantro rice either! I despise cilantro with a passion, I don't get along with it, but the rice was amazing. Like literally buttery and mouth watering it was hands down the best rice I've ever had. I can't rave enough about the quality of ingredients at El Dorado Cantina. I wish we had one here in LA because the food was so so SO delicious. I will make it a point to stop here every time I visit Vegas. It's a must!",

Mole Platter- This seemed really expensive to me until I realized that the price is commiserate with the amount of food you get. It's easily an extra two meals for me to take home.  Flan- This is hands down the best flan I have ever had. It's so creamy as opposed to gelatin forward. It's Cool Whip, not whipped cream on the side though, so watch out for that.",

    "text": "I'd like to say that if they had better portions and slightly cheaper prices, this place would be a 4 or 4 and a half.  5 if they also had spicier stuff or more vegan stuff cuz I'm biased xD.  Also would mainly be going here if I'm in the area or late night after work.  Those who came with me and ate everything I didn't, enjoyed the food.  They're not critics or chefs but they often eat latin or Mexican food, either they're own or family's home-cooked meals.  They liked it but the prices were eh.      From what I remember smelling and seeing from the meat stuff was that it was well marinated and seasoned.  My pals enjoyed the dishes but again the prices didn't validate the portions.  Being next to Sapphire's Strip club the prices can be hiked up and still seen as a deal in comparison to the outrages drinks and prices for dances and booths next door.  The happy hour is probably the highlight.  Though not the best deal and value in town, it's still great being that it's a business near the strip and it's mad late night.  Even a place that has semi-decent Mexican that isn't outrageously pricey.  I wouldn't say this place is authentic but it's tasty nonetheless.      The dishes I had were pretty good.  I can honestly say that I'd come back here again late night and grab a few bites for happy hour.  I had the first round complimentary Chips and Salsa, if you want another round it's $3.50 and the salsa is good.  Needs to be spicier in my opinion xD.  Veggie/Vegan bowl and Cactus taco are what I had.  Can't say it's the best, nor the worst.  Overall I think the best Vegan Mexican Dishes still go to Pancho's on Pecos.  With a few other places, you see on Yelp.      For vegans, you can see the menu highlights the vegan options with the VG symbol.  You can also check the menu on their website.  There's the Tableside Guacamole or Ghost Chili Salsa, Veggie Salad, Chiles Toreados, Seasonal Veggies, Tacos with Cactus or Veggie, and Veggie Burrito.  Remind your server or bartender to make it Vegan if not already specified.  Vegetarian eaters will have more than twice as many selections.  For the regular eat whatever meat eaters, this place should be much better for ya if you're used to paying the typical overpriced touristy cost.      When it comes to the environment and upkeep, I'd say this place is a 4.  The ambiance and lighting, color scheme, decor, set up, is all on point.  The cleanliness of the bar, stools, tables, bathrooms was all tidy.  It's actually suitable for the romantic types that like that intimate setting, except that if you have a great peripheral vision or ADD gotta look at everything around you, you may be thrown off with Stripper booties and loud drunk dudes here and there.  If you don't mind it this place is still very quaint and quiet late nights.      The service was on point.  Again not too many people around, and both the bartenders I had were quick and attentive which is always a must.  They know the majority of the right answers to your questions though not everything you may ask will they have an answer to.  They don't seem too uptight, conversations or joking around while eating will be smooth and they'll still be attentive enough to remember to ask if you need anything or check on other guests.      If they can make some of the dishes spicier, smokier, lower price a bit or at least increase portions, I'd properly rate this place higher.  I think you should at least come by one time and see what you feel about the joint.",

This was and is an easy spot for me to recommend to friends and acquaintances who spend any time in Vegas looking for good Mexican food in a chill atmosphere that is often hard to find in Vegas without a trek.   I think I returned to having Carne Asada burrito and my dining guest the full fledged combo fajitas. We both were very content with the simplicity and flavor (balanced and measured) of the proteins and the light touch on the sides that demonstrates that they are humanely sourcing their proteins and doing the \"organic thing\" but ensuring it had a quality taste.  Would always return, even if the location proves to be an interesting landmark to give.",

The salsa trio that is presented when you get seated is really good, and is so appreciated when arriving hungry, as I usually do.  Their tableside guacamole is awesome and tastes as fresh as you would expect it to.  The queso fundido was very good the few times that I've gotten it.  I really enjoy the Veggie Bowl.  It is very hearty and you don't miss the fact that there is no meat.  I appreciate how they have many Vegetarian options and can accommodate vegan requests in many cases as well.

    "text": "I went with a group of about 10 people for a birthday dinner. For dinner we all decided to order the medium sized portion meal that serves several people. The food itself was good and there was enough meat and sides to serve everyone generously. Our waiter was very attentive, but I don't think I will be returning for the following reasons: 1. We saw on their website that on Wednesday's it's HALF OFF all tequila drinks, so we ordered several margaritas as a group. When we received our tab, the drinks were not half off. We asked the waiter to correct this and she indicated that it wasn't initially discounted since it's a \"secret discount\" but it's on their website!! 2. The waiter informed us that each person that checks in on Yelp would receive a FREE flan. The majority of the group checked in and received their free flan (which was delicious). For whatever reason they decided to charge us for each flan on our tab, which we also had to tell her to remove and she did. 3. We had several empty seats in our table and we were done eating, so they asked if they could move us to the bar so another group could occupy our large table. We did not object to this and sat at the bar and continued to order drinks. When we received our tab we noticed that our drinks, tax and gratuity wasn't adding up correctly. After about 20 minutes of my friend going back and fourth with them about fixing the tab the manager had the nerve to ask us if the gratuity was correct??!! Needless to say the tab was fixed, but all the embarrassment could have been avoided if they would just honor the discounts published on their website and not charge for something that they said would be free.",

But upon entering we werent greeted by anyone and didnt get seated until after a minute when workers decided to stop talking amongst each other and decided to help us, the customers. Then we ordered our food. We had a party of 7 and we all ordered at the same time one of the people in our party didnt recieve her food until 10 minutes after everyone else recieved there food. The food was mediocre at best. And im being generous. Not only that, but when ever we needed something our waiter was no where to be found. Let me remind u there was only 3 other parties in the whole restraunt. Then at the end while everyone was done eating our waiter brought out a carne asada taco which the person that had ordered it forgot he even ordered it.

My mom and I shared the Carne Asada and the tableside guacamole---it was mmm, mmm, good!  The tortilla chips were even good.  The Carne Asada was extremely seasoned and tender, in addition to the portion being rather large (and I'm greedy); we couldn't eat it all, so we definitely had leftovers.  Now let's get to the service---it was subpar.  Our server was inattentive.  When we brought to her attention that we didn't receive flour tortillas as requested, she searched through the tortillas only to prove herself wrong---idiot!!  Who does that???  We had to continually repeat our requests and some were never even answered--and that was by random workers walking by, as we couldn't wait till Christmas for our server to reappear.",

My favorite is their carnitas and I usually get the carnitas burrito.. it's SO good! The meat is soft and tasty. I got their carnitas tacos during happy hour and it's literally just the carnitas with the tortilla so I questioned how good it will be but their meat is so flavorful that it doesn't even need sauces or anything extra. Their happy hour and locals discount is a huge plus. I'd consider this the best Mexican food in town.",

    "text": "First time here, I saved this restaurant to check out over years. I was excited to find out they're a non-gmo, fresh ingredients restaurant off the strip. I have a lot of allergies and this make it really easy for me to eat here.  I don't know what was going on the night we came.. but it looks like they were celebrating their 3 years anniversary.  I booked a reservation for 11PM.  We came on time.  There was no one greeting us at the front for a while. I was confused if they were closing?  I walked to one of the table to ask the guy who just started to clean up the table if we're supposed to seat ourselves or are they closing here?  He told me, he'll be right with me.  We had to wait another 5 minutes or so.  I think, it's more important to greet customers than start cleaning a table. There are so many other tables available. It took a while for everything, from ordering drinks, ordering food, getting food, trying to order a cocktail, getting the bill.  I'm not sure if they were short staff or what everyone else was doing.  I saw a lot of staffs there, I just don't know what their roles were.  I know, we weren't the only ones having issues.  Everyone else that came after us were the same.  There were two tables that were there before us getting upset that they didn't get their food or drinks yet. The lady in the white blouse came by their table and said, \"You good?\"  I think she was the manager or supervisor.  I'm sorry, but that's not really professional to start off a conversation with upset guests who requested to speak to the manager like that.  She came by our table and did the same thing.  But she added, you guys got everything you need?  I was thinking in my head, if you look down at our table you can see only 2 entrees were on the table and 2 other guests didn't have any entrees.  That should answer your question, Missy.   We ordered.   Carne Asada Burrito  (So Tasty!) Carnitas Burrito  (Melts in your mouth) Short Ribs Tacos with Flour Tortillas (+$1 for each taco, must try) Original Margarita (the lime weren't fresh so it made my drink super bitter)     Our server was good, I can tell she was really stressed out running around the restaurants.  She did spill my cocktail on the table when she dropped it off, because she was in a rush.    Food: 5 Stars Service: 0 Stars  Overall, the food was delicious.  It's definitely a place I would come back for the food.  The service needs to be looked into.  We'll try earlier on in the day next time.    Also, just a recommendation for the late night guests.... if you're so short on staff.  Maybe you should have everyone seat themselves and go order at the bar.  Hand out the numbers for the food runner to drop off the food and drinks.  This way it maybe better for your guests to enjoy their time here.",

The good- it had a great interior, I loved my margarita, the free chips & salsa were good, my dinner was incredibly tasty. I ordered the two tacos - vegetarian, I believe it was Arbol peppers. It was so very hot though, I didn't realize it, but oh so good. So much flavor. Not much food though, as tacos didn't have much fillings in them. I was able to roll them up like taquitos. Despite the price, It didn't come with an included side so I ordered the Mexican corn as well.. Also very good. I loved what I ate, it was just a lot $ for what it was.  The not good - our waiter appeared to be very overwhelmed. He was pleasant but our service was slow & didn't see much of him. We saw him rushing past our table a lot. He was even making guacamole table side. I've never seen the waiter doing this job as well. I would hope that management rethinks this. Meanwhile we were waiting for drink refills. My mouth was on fire, so I just drank all of my boyfriends water and he did get his beer later. We did sit there for awhile waiting for our check as well. Next table came after us and left before we got our check. We actually had to ask for our check twice.  My boyfriend ordered a rice burrito.. I mean a pork burrito. It was all carbs... He said the pork was tasty but there wasn't much of it in there, it was primarily filled with rice and the side that came with it? Yup more of the same rice?! So a lot of filler. He said the rice was good, just way too much.  I'd be open to trying it again but going for drinks and apps and sitting at the bar.",

Things have changed a lot - it seems the staff is smaller and the excitement is gone .. the main woman seemingly running the floor looks miserable and has a short temper , no customer service skills - Maria I think is her name   I choose to only sit at the bar now with some of the classic workers who have been here and know how to treat a repeating familiar local guest   I hope the local family vibe isn't gone forever. Feels like a corporate business now - sadly my friends don't even come back because of the service   Hopefully this changes caus the food is great and so is Tuesday, 1942 special",

Strip clubs aren't my thing, but if it's yours and you also enjoy good Mexican food, then why not come here and kill two birds with one stone.    Their food is of good quality, not greasy like some Mexican places.   With that said, the pulled chicken tacos entree was quite tasty.  It was flavorful, but not overly salty or spicy.  The refried beans and cilantro rice complement each other and the tacos nicely.  Also, they make guacamole fresh in front of you so you can choose which ingredients to add or omit.    Service was impeccable!  Would definitely come back.",

    "text": "I'm glad I got the opportunity to try El Dorado Cantina. It's been on my bookmark list for a while and I've heard really good things. I came here on a Friday night after the normal place I go to had a line out the door. I was with some under age people so we couldn't sit at the bar. We walked in and were seated promptly but no one came over to us for a while. They were down on servers. We sat down opened up the menu and were surprised by the prices. $20 for a burrito is a lot. $4.50 for tacos.. The twice what I normally pay. We decided to stay and try it out. We saw they have Happy Hour from 12am-2am but it said only at the bar. When the waitress was finally able to come over we asked if it was possible to order from HH at the table and she said no. She was really nice about it and asked another server if they would be okay with it but ended up being a no. I just think they shouldn't put the advertisement on the table them or offer specials for the table too. The table comes with chips and red and green salsa, green was my fav, but refills for chips and salsa is $3.50. That just crazy to me. Anyways, I decided to try some different tacos and see what the hype has been about. My friend ordered the same and the others had a burrito and salad. I ordered the carnitas, al pastor, and carne asada. My favorite was the carne asada. My friend's order came with rice and beans which were alright, nothing special. We also had an order of churros before we left. The has some filling and some chocolate and banana dipping sauce that were okay. Overall a good experience but I don't think I would come back unless I'm dining during HH, $1.00 off tacos and $7 app. It's a pretty cool place, oh and it's right next to Sapphire if you are into that. ;)",

    "text": "My colleagues and I went here while we were in Las Vegas for professional development.  Our waiter was the rudest most foul-mooded server I've ever encountered.  We were nothing but friendly and I honestly can't think of why he would be so rude except for the fact that we used Living Social (or Groupon, I can't remember which), coupons to save some money.  We brushed it off, but over the course of the meal it became almost awkward when we would ask for another cocktail or whatever else. The chef/owner came out to check on us. He was extremely friendly and kind.  We told him, kindly, as we thought he would like to know, that it seemed our waiter was in much less than a happy mood to be serving us. The chef seemed genuinely concerned and offered to give us two free flan desserts. We thanked him sincerely. He asked us to return and to spread the word about the restaurant and tell our other colleagues to come out to enjoy a meal.  Upon receiving our bill we noticed that we were charged for one of the flan's.  It was strange and awkward and at that point we just paid without saying anything further and left.    With regards to the food... It wasn't memorable. Not bad, not great. There was a man singing for entertainment of the guests, as many restaurants have, who was very awkward.  We were one of two small groups in the restaurant and he was singing his own acoustic, silly versions of pop songs like Britney Spears' \"Hit Me Baby One More Time.\" It totally didn't go with the cantina atmosphere of the restaurant and it was so loud and honestly a bit obnoxious.  It was funny at first, but then just... annoying. We didn't complain. We smiled, we applauded, we engaged with him when he engaged with us via the microphone from across the restaurant.    I never write a place off due to one rude server who may have just been having a bad night. (Granted, he seemed to be very friendly with a couple of local gals having a drink at the bar.) Anyways, I don't think I would ever return here being that the food was average, the service was far below average, we were charged for an \"on-the-house\" dessert that was intended to \"make up for\" the bad service, and the musician providing the tunes for the night did not fit the vibe of the restaurant... at. all.",

For those going for the first time, if you're standing under Sapphire's awning looking at its front door, El Dorado Cantina's door is a mere 20 feet to the left, part of the same structure.  With that said, once inside, it has zero resemblance/association to Sapphire (as far as I could tell). I was greeted pleasantly by two hostesses, one of which went out of her way to try to find the baseball game I wanted to watch.  My server was nice and efficient, too. I had the street taco plate, al pastor.  The tortillas were delicious as were the contents.  And I actually ate the side of beans and rice.  Normally I don't because other places put too much salt in them, but these were good. I liked the decor - lots of booths with leather seating, and high bar tables with leather seating, too. But most importantly the food was good and at a good price: $2.50 for a fountain coke, $7.50 for tacos al pastor.  Lunch for 10 bucks! Would go back.",

I thought that was very nice, it definitely gives you the feeling that the employees care about the restaurant.  As for the food, I had the veggie tacos they were so flavorful you would have no idea that they did not contain meat. The rice was just ok. The re-fried beans were perfect.They do bring chips and salsa to the table like other places but what sets them apart from most is that they give you 3 different salsas to try. It's great having a place that actually has a spicy salsa, so many place the salsa is just basic and bland not here.

The Mood at the Artesian looked too busy,  so I consulted with Yelp.  El Dorado Cantina came up as the next closet place.  So I got brave and walked over (25 minutes) to here.  When I arrived,  I was in front of Sapphire (The World's Largest Gentleman's Club). As a gay guy,  I was very hesitant to approach the building :) The entrance is separate of the gentleman's club.  The first booth I saw,  had a couple with their children.  Very professional and courteous staff.  Food is excellent,  and not greasy like many Mexican restaurants. A very personal touch was to see the chef out visiting the patrons.  Be sure to try the flan,  it will send you off in bliss.  So glad I came in.  Will be back,  next time I am LV.  Hope you enjoy also. headed back to my hotel,  will grab a taxi - there's plenty out front.  Not to mention that there is also plenty of parking,  if you are driving...",

(\"The service was horrible.\") Our service was excellent! Our waiter was great, the manager was great and the chef even came out and checked on us twice! He even gave us a free dessert! (\"The food wasn't good.\") Our food was delicious! I had carne asada street tacos, my friends had shrimp tacos and enchiladas. We were all very pleased with our meals. I'm very happy I found this place and will be returning often. I'm guessing the bad reviewer probably works at a competing restaurant nearby!",

I remember the first bite being the best moment of my life though so even if it wasn't that good it must have been pretty great.    I didn't get a chance to taste their drinks though others say they were fantastic.  I was on a strictly coffee and water phase at that point in the night and both those were fine.    The restaurant itself was really cool, lots of fun decor which made the ambiance really nice.  Overall just a really fun and yummy place to go though if I had any complaint the coffee wasn't great.

    "text": "How conveniently located right next to Sapphires.  Turn into the Sapphires parking lot, and you've come to the right place.    I've heard many good things about El Dorado.  Saw some billboards advertising gluten free and non-gmo Mexican food.  Healthy Mexican food......interesting.    Their menu is pretty pricey.  You as might as well call it strip prices.  $13 for 3 street tacos, and that doesn't even include refried beans and rice; however, locals get 25% off, and there are other deals throughout the week.    Aside from pricey, their food was very delicious.  You start with chips and 2 salsa dips.  I had a house margarita for $11.  It's a large portion.    Ordered the shrimp taquitos and carne asada tacos with refried beans and cilantro rice.    The shrimp taquitos come in 5 and are normally on a bed of guac.  I decided to get it on the side.  They were smaller than the taquitos I'm used to, but since there were 5, they were very filling.  The shrimp took about 3/4 of the actual taquito.  Sauce drizzled on the taquitos were tasty and no sauce I've ever tried before on a taquito.  Also good when dipping the taquito in guac.    Each of the carne asada tacos had a generous portion of meat.  More like it was overfilled with meat, onions, and cilantro.  The meat definitely tasted like it was healthier, less greasy, and had more flavor to it than any carne asada I've had.  The refried beans tasted authentic as well as the cilantro rice.    If you check in on Yelp, you get a free flan!  I was super stuffed and had to box my carne asada to go, but the flan was so awesome that I just scarfed it down with a quickness!    Next time I'll have to try the tableside guac.   As a local, I think I'll come here on Mondays to claim the 25% locals discount.",

Expect to pay $25-30 per person for a meal that would likely run you $10 or less at a food truck.  I admit there are establishment charges, but that cannot fully explain the price premium.  The food (at least what I tried) was quite ordinary.  Maybe I am so used to New York Mexican places that I can't tell authentic Mexican when I taste it?  The quesadillas were bursting at the seams with cheese.  The complimentary chips and salsa however did hit the spot.    I will likely return to give El Dorado another chance, especially since it is so close to the strip.  But my expectations have certainly been tempered from this first visit.",

Our food was very good but the service was lacking. Our server wasn't very attentive. Seemed she rather spend her time at the bar talking than attending to her customers and never returned to our table to check on us after our food was brought out until she brought us our check. It took her 15 minutes or so to check on us AFTER we were already done eating and rather than ask how everything was and if we would like a dessert or something all she did was drop the check off asked if we wanted more water then walked away when we turned down more water. My wife and I were actually waiting to order the Rosado Flan but due to her inattentiveness we were out of time to be able to order, wait, then eat the flan. Such a poor experience for my first time there. Not to sure if I will be back or not. To me bad service outweighs good food on if we will return. Again food was very good, the Toastditas de Tinga were very good, but the service killed it.",

I just thought it was strange that he kept forgetting things and I had to remind him several times for things.   Food: My husband and I are always looking for great Mexican restaurants wherever we travel. He had the steak burrito and I ordered the Veggie Enchiladas. We did not like them at all. I ate maybe 1/3 of my plate before I refused to eat more. I didn't even take it home to give it another shot the next day! I never do this. The white rice with cilantro was very bland, hard and tasted like it had been sitting out for a while. The tortillas broke apart under the sauce, instead of holding together. The beans were lacking something and they had that weird \"out too long\" look when served to us. The zucchini in the enchilada looked like it was cooked on one side and left green on the other and it was still a little chewy. Asked for Guac and it was salty but no other discernible flavors! I don't know guys, this was not a pleasant experience for me.   Decor: A little outdated and dark. Their awards are inside of the men's bathroom... that was strange. I liked the flower walls but maybe just one main wall would have been nicer. I'm always thinking about dust, and that just screamed \"I\"M DUSTYYYYYY!!!\" :)  OVERALL: Disappointed and Bland Tasting.",

My boyfriend and I usually reach for the chicken enchiladas, but the shrimp tacos are bomb too.   I'm a sucker for sangria... and this place HANDS DOWN has the best sangria I've had yet!

    "text": "What took Las Vegas so long to catch up with everyone else and finally open a fresh, organic, non GMO Mexican place?!? Well done, El Dorado, well done.  I first experienced this spot when I was working at a near-by high rise, and I would get it delivered via Post Mates. That's when I fell in love and knew I had to dine here in person.  Little did I know, it's attached to Sapphire strip club and I freaked out the whole family when I pulled in the parking lot. Don't let that fool you, minors are indeed welcome. However, from personal experience, I would NOT bring them before 11 AM when the drunk strippers next door just got off work, or after 10 PM when the guys are pre-gaming before hitting the club. Again, simply a local's bit of advice and nothing more.  I have sent my boss here, my mom here, and again my kid and always get positive feedback. It is a little pricier than your average Mexican restaurant. But when you go to Whole Foods, or Sprouts, it too, is above average in cost. Like the very True saying goes, you get what you pay for.  The offer vegan or vegetarian options, like cactus or veggie tacos. There are also some unique signature dishes such as the Siegal plate or lettuce wraps. I feel like this place is a mix of authentic, fresh-mex, and  health food all in one, with liquor. Did I mention the alcohol yet? Or how delicious the jalapeno margarita is? They have a ton of different tequilas, and a full bar! So, you don't HAVE to bring the kids every time.",

Love the restaurant ambiance, dim lighting, sugar skulls, very comfortable seats, big tv's for the bar, and great selection of tequila.   We sat down at the bar and had Jessy as our server/bartender I believe. Very knowledgeable, we came in for happy hour which is 3-6 pm, $1 street tacos , 3 dollar domestic beers, 4 dollar imports, and 4 dollar well drinks. All beers are in bottle, no draft beer here.    They ask you if you would like any chips and salsa they give you 3 types of salsa mild, med, and hot. All 3 were very good. For the tacos I had 1 of each they have 5 types. Top 3 are the Carnitas, alpastor, and cochinito. Get those 3 and you will be extremely happy, especially paying 1 dollar each. The Margarita was decent but not bad.    We got 7 street tacos, 1 domestic beer, 1 margarita, beans and rice and only paid 19.47 so yeah I definitely think this place earns 5 stars.",

I am a vegetarian with celiac 's also , so to see they had a gluten free , vegetarian menu on top of non GMO was a jackpot! We have needed a place like this in Vegas . I really hope they do well & stay open . My only fear is the location . Not so convenient for the locals.   The Food was delicious ! I had the veggie tacos , my Aunt had shrimp taquitos , cousin had carne  Asada tacos , mom had the breakfast fried eggs & beans plate (can't remember name) . We also had the flan & fried ice-cream . EVERYTHING was amazing. . All the meat is hormone free also . If you don't know much about organic , non GMO food ... Do some research ! This is NOT easy or cheap to do.. It is not the most convenient either . For them to have a great menu with these wonderful options at great prices is incredible . Now to the service ... Holy smokes , our waiter was so friendly & educated on all their food & different diet needs . His name was Kai and I would request him for sure .He also happened to be an assistant manager. Then another assistant manager (Arianna) came to our table to introduce herself & see how the service was. After that , the Chef himself (Chef Paco) wanted to see how we enjoyed the food , then brought us a free sample of the flan. . Such nice people & such a cute place . The only negative thing I can say is it's next to a strip club & not in a great part of town .  Excited to go back !",

I got the three taco combo, al pastor and chicken. The meat was fresh and flavorful. My friends and I only wished the cilantro rice had more flavor.  But I have every intention to go back, visit,  and tell all my friends! Chef paco came out personally introduced himself, walked out our dessert and was so hospitable!  Would definitely recommend coming here again.",

The only reason I came across El Dorado is due to its proximity to my workplace, and I'm glad I did.   The street tacos are amazing! Authentic, fresh and delicious. You can choose from a variety of meats including al pastor, carnitas, carne, pollo, and more. Think traditional Mexican restaurant-sized portions too so you might have leftovers. Shoouulddd have leftovers I should say...  I'm a sucker for corn elote and I'm glad I ordered it because it didn't disappoint. Also, Vegas locals get half off on Mondays (maybe just for lunch, call and verify). When we went, a Yelp check in also meant for a large, free churro dessert. Yes please.   After coming here a few times, a common thread seems to be slow service, especially for lunch in an area common for businesses. But hey, can't say I won't be back!",

    "text": "I had a small, very quick wedding last weekend with less than 20 of my closest family and friends. I had very high hopes for this place to be our post-ceremony dinner after researching and reading positive reviews. They were very sweet and accommodating leading up to the night but sadly, I was dissapointed.  We were placed in a back room I'm assuming due to the size of our party. The room was hot and had zero music or atmosphere to it. I thought it would have more personality and it was a let down. Our drinks took almost 30 minutes to arrive, I think only about 4 of us ordered a cocktail, the rest were bottles of beer. It took about 30 or 40 minutes for our food orders to be taken and at that point everyone was restless and started to order their drinks directly from the bar. From what I recall, it wasn't slammed or crazy busy in the front of the restaurant so that was unfortunate. The few people who ordered food didn't have any complaints about taste or quality so I gave them a star for that (hoping nothing was tampered with). I had wanted to try their cocktails more than anything but couldn't see holding my group back to wait another 30 minutes to be served.   My biggest regret was my father spending around $500 here and everyone getting the terrible service that they did. I don't know if the server was the issue or if management set her up for failure by assigning her other tables AND a large party but regardless, it was the downfall of my wedding weekend :(",

    "text": "We came here for lunch last week on a Monday.  I had heard about El Dorado for years but never made it in. It is a Mexican restaurant that's attached to sapphires gentlemen's club right off of the strip. There is a separate entrance so you don't have to go the same way as the Gentlemans club doors.  First impression was it was really nice inside- the decor looks a bit like old Vegas with red walls and dark leather seats, but really clean and nice. It's kind of in a U-shaped with a bar in the middle area.  We were seated immediately and given menus which had quite a good selection of Mexican food. I will say that this is pretty Mexican food and not authentic Mexican good.  Also, it is very overpriced. 3 tiny street tacos a la carte were $15.  There were four of us in our party and we all ordered. We did get the tableside guac which was OK. There wasn't that much seasoning to it so it was a bit bland.  Our food came out and everything looked good, presentation is definitely important to the kitchen. One person had the fish tacos which they said were mediocre, other person had some other seafood taco which they said were also mediocre. My husband had some taco plate which he said was just okay. I had veggie tacos which were also mediocre LOL. All in all, the food here was mediocre, but the prices were definitely high. Don't get me wrong, I get that you can charge a lot for food when you're located next to a nudey bar because drunk guys coming to eat off their buzz will spend their money on food.  I don't think that I would go back, only because there are good Mexican food options that are  a lot better all over this town.",

I was looking for a good Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas and this was such a better option in comparison to El Gordo. My recommendation is to eat at the bar because you will be in good hands with Ivan or Aaron. Hands down, they are the best bartenders/waiters! They will give you the best laughs to end a long work day 100 times better.  They also recommended to order the imperial shrimp,  seafood enchiladas, carne asada plate and any of their tacos a la carte, which were all fantastic recommendations and was a good amount of food for 3 people. We did family style and shared so we could try a little bit of everything. The dishes were all so delicious but the seafood enchilada was probably my favorite. We got the flan for dessert and it was a yummy nightcap to end the meal. I am so glad I found this restaurant because I will definitely come back!",

As maps got us to our destination we were laughing because it took us to the parking lot of a gentlemens club.  After asking someone though he pointed out the restaurant litterally right next the the club. It was sorta camoflauged by plants.   Really nice atmosphere inside.  Was immediately greeted and seated and brought drinks including water.  Camille was our server and she was super cute and very hospitabiltle.  We both ordered the carneasada rajas burrito (mine chimichanga style and wet).  OMG were we floored by the taste.  This was litterally the best burrito of my life.  We both enjoyed it.  It came with cilantro rice which was cooked perfectly as well. I added a little of their green sauce which I could have drank from the bowl it was so good.  I visit vegas about 3 times a year since my son lives there.  Going forward this will be someplace I visit as well!  I highly recommend it!",

I had their chicken in a cream sauce with chipotle and it was extremely good. The mushed is black beans lacked much flavor and were a little starchy, they needed some salt. Imagine, anything that isn't over salted? What a rarity that is. The rice with cilantro was an amazing surprise. I usually don't eat this rice but this rice was really, really good. My wife had enchiladas and they were good, two thumbs up. My first judgement of a Mexican restaurant starts with the salsa and this salsa was definitely in the upper level. I know there a lot of 5 star ratings but I couldn't go there because my chicken was a little ( note I said \"little\") over cooked and the black beans could have been a little more flavorful. My final comment is that I would not hesitate to go to the El Dorado Cantina. I can't imagine someone not liking this place.  One final comment mentioned by others, this place is in the same building as a \"gentlemen's club.\" That creates no problem as the entrances are completely separate. The only thing to note is the gentleman's club signage is dominant so just follow your gps.",

A few of my favorite things:  - carnitas torta - pupusas - tres leches cake  I've had cartinas tortas before and tres leches cakes elsewhere, but the pupusas were next level.

    "text": "Ok so I've been here twice now and both times we were blessed with the same server. Super nice lady named Stella that works a perfect balance of being attentive without being intrusive. The food here is excellent so the stars are deserved for that alone but the service just puts the cherry on top of it. Both times I've had the cheese enchiladas and we also ordered the table side guacamole. My friend and fellow comedian Steven Roberts ordered the corn this most recent time and it was AMAZING and a big enough portion that combined with our respective meals it was plenty to share between me, Steven and his husband. I can't remember what all they had because my head was buried in my own plate. While Stella was making the table side guacamole we were able to chat and that was great too. Again a great balance of personable without being overly personal. Between the food and Stella this place really is tough to beat. Originally when I was told that the restaurant was on the same property as Sapphire Gentlemen's club I though the food would be overpriced and the patrons would be frat guys, NOT the case. Good ambience and mostly just seemed like people that wanted to have a relaxed dinner at very reasonable prices. I'd definitely recommend El Dorado, and Stella, to anyone. Not sure of her exact schedule but we've been in graveyard Sunday nights on both visits. If you're thinking about it, GO FOR IT!!!",

The atmosphere was nice with sports on the television if you enjoy that.  Ordered the vegetarian burrito which came with cilantro lime rice.  Food was delicious. Burrito was very filling. Received a free flan for checking in, also quite good and I'm not usually a fan of flan.  Server was hospitable, might be new he looked a little nervous but was friendly and quick with our order.  Chef came out to check on our table and to deliver the flan.  Overall I would definitely return to this restaurant if I'm back in town and highly recommend it.

    "text": "Ok, so let's get this out of the way, this place was way OVERPRICED. Twenty-four dollars for a dinner plate of pork rice and beans? It's more expensive than WEST LA. What is the justification for this price? Even with the free FLAN (The highlight of the night), it should have been less than $20 dollars.  I got the Pork Carnitas. The meat was very juicy and tendor, but came out only slightly warm. The side chips came with three type of salsa, but the chips were STALE and cold. Definitely the disappointment of the meal. Chips should be hot, fresh off the oven. If they are not, then just warm them up slightly. It was luke cold!  The black bean side was warmed up in the microwave I could tell simply because the outside was colder than the inside. I HATE when restaurants microwave their food. If I wanted a microwave, I'd would have bought some SMART ones, which ain't so SMART, and just nuke it myself.  Side rice was just ok, alongside the pickled vegetables.  The Flan was absolutely excellent. The highlight of the night, and a must have. You get one for free with your meal when you check into yelp  It is this critics opinion that he judges this place perhaps more harshly than it needs to be because he lives in Las Angeles, which has the greatest Mexican food in the world arguably.   3/5",

I am from Los Angeles where Mexican and Latin restaurants are plentiful but we don't have a unique fair like El Dorado that I have yet discovered.  Not a fan person but....El Dorado's flan is so delicious I can't get enough!  Try the platter with three different types of Mole.  Incredible.  Just be sure to ask for extra tortillas.  It can feed four if you go to El Dorado's happy hour first.  Oh and the happy hour, great margaritas!  I just notice that five months ago the margaritas were larger though.  You get three amazing level of salsas with chips.  Son miss and don't let the Sapphire Gentlemen's Club scare you away.  They share parking. Bon appetit!",

The location is definitely odd, but the inside is incredibly inviting.  The food is fantastic. From the different salsas to the fried ice cream, El Dorado Cantina has not disappointed me. I love the carne asada burrito; I crave it. The steak is definitely the best out of chicken, shrimp, and steak, but they are all good. The chef regularly comes into the dining room to greet the guests, and he is incredibly friendly. It really makes dining here a special experience.

Anyways I've been wanting to try this place for a really long time so finally today on a very random night we decided to go. And well because there wasn't many places open that late. We were greeted by a man at the door who gave us the option to sit at a table or the bar since they had happy hour going on. We didn't want to drink so we sat in a table. Right away he brought us chips and salsa which we enjoyed a little too much as they were gone before our food came out. Huge mistake because I was so stuff by then. I usually don't like to eat meat, but because this place is organic and GMO free I was perfectly okay with it. I had the street tacos. 1 alpastor, 1 cochinita and 1 rajas. All accompany by rice and beans. I loved the tacos! The cochinita had purple onions with habanero omg really good kick. The alpastor were good and sweet from the pineapple. The rajas were okay. My boyfriend had their carne Asada plate and he loved it! I tried a piece of it and it really was delicious. To finish off we had their flan. Ohhhmmgeeeee it was so bomb! So rich and creamy at the same time. Our server was named Charles and he was amazing! Really nice and was on top of everything. Over all I had zero complaints about this whole place. Definitely coming back next week, and I am bringing the parentals.",

It's also a great value! Do yourself a favor: get off the strip and try this NOW. Your wallet and taste buds will thank you. Even the rice and refried beans have a unique flavor!

We didn't have one but were seated right away, then the place filled right up and people were waiting. The food is Non GMO and the proteins are free from antibiotics, pesticides, and steroids. the waiter brought out some chips and salsas right away and we ordered some guacamole which is prepared tableside to you liking. I had an ear of Mexican street corn(elote) which was perfectly grilled an just enough spice along with the cheese and mayo. My entre was a mahi taco and a shrimp taco served with rice and choice of beans, refried for me. Both marinated in  citrus come with guacamole, a chipotle mayo and cabbage. The Mahi has a mango salsa while the shrimp have a pico de gallo. Both were excellent with the shrimp being my favorite of the two. We received an order of flan with our Yelp check in.

Hubby had the chicken enchiladas and I had the veggie bowl (tons of veggie, GF, vegan options). Reasonable food prices for Vegas. Service was fast and super friendly. Checking in on Yelp got us a free flan dessert that retails for $8. We had leftovers for the next day. They take reservations and we were seated pronto. So. Good.",

We ordered the table side guacamole. ..it was terrible. The avocados tasted fresh but that was all you tasted. We asked for medium hot and it was zero hot. it had no flavor outside of the avocados. Gorditas: Bad and they charged $9! Must have had a bad day. We ordered this based on rave review of a friend. Carnitas: Very good. Jalepeno margaritas also very good. Flan was excellent. Converted a non-flan eater to fan. The other 3 in the party had burritos...all okay but not enough to go out of their way to come back.",

For a Mexican restaurant the prices  are a bit high but that was the best part.  I went in early, some were just getting out of working from the club next door. 7am. I was hungry and heard great things about the food even though I been here for drinks before.  I waited 20 mins before we even got a Menu. I had to ASK. Fine. Our waiter Nick was the WORST. No expression. No recommendations. No experience or desire to be there. Daniel a pretty popular guy there I would think would have much better. FIne. Most importantly The Food. I wanted to try something one just doesn't order anywhere, the place looks nice and I ordered the mole with rice and beans. DRY Sauce, Dry CHICKEN, Barely any sauce? Like what! I asked for onions on the side and he got upset. \" I can...but it will take a long time\".....? Rice is all BUTTER and well Refried Frijoles is hard to mess this up.  The last draw was that it was left under the heat lamp for too Long. Keep in mind this place had maybe 5 tables at this time, no excuse for food to be left unattended THAT long.  It was terrible!  20 dollar plate for a JOKE of place that thinks its Mexican. ITS NOT. This place is a well decorated TRAP and CLEARLY underdeveloped waitstaff that in the end, the FOOD says a thousand words. I wanted to like this place my second time around but NO. You will be better off going to Roberto's at least they dont ROB you like this place Robbed the idea of a decent Mexican restaurant. I would give 0 stars if I could!",

From there we tried the tres leches cake, the flan and the churros. The tres leches cake had a strong rum taste which was interesting. Other than that, everything was on point!

My wife and I were in Vegas for the weekend and went with two friends looking for some good Mexican food that wouldn't break the bank. This place had great reviews on YELP and so we were like let's do it. TRUST ME... Some of the best Mexican food I have ever had for such a good price. Please go and support this place. The owner/chef even came out an introduced himself to us and told us about his mother's recipes. Awesome. Great service. Great food. Great atmosphere. If you are staying in Vegas and don't want to eat at the expensive places at the hotels just go a little off the strip and hit this place up.",

    "text": "We passed this place because it's attached to the Sapphire. When we realized where it actually was, we almost didn't go in. Surprisingly, though, almost everyone dining at ED was what I would call a \"normal\"--i.e., not a recent visitor to the Sapphire.  Short story: Do not be dissuaded by the Sapphire.   ED has Excellent Mexican food. We had one of each of the street tacos, as well as guacamole and a salad.  Everything was high quality, particularly the al pastor and cochinita tacos.  The chips weren't great, but otherwise, everything was very good.   For those who care, the place is very nice on the inside.  They seem to have a lot of specials--happy hour, etc--so much so that the servers forget some of them.  In fact, our $1 tacos special didn't actually make it onto our ticket.   This strikes me as the kind of place that, in a different city, might have started out as a well-loved food truck and then transitioned into a better spot than where it actually ended up. (I wish that it were in downtown, for example.) That being said, we'll definitely be back.  Chef Paco came by our table, and seemed genuinely excited about his food.  I think he has every reason to be.",

Not to mention the huge margaritas, with the perfect combination of salt and tequila. The food was amazing and the presentation when they brought the food and drinks out, looked out of a magazine.

The corn chips and dips which came out to start tasted so fresh. The habanero one was no joke. The head chef/owner I believe came and spoke with us after our meal to make sure everything was fine. He was so excited to hear what we thought and explained all the recipes had been passed down from his mother. He was very proud of the place and so he should be. We are visitors from Australia, it's a shame we probably won't be able to go back again!",

Without our asking, El Dorado re-made the order (it was perfect) AND deducted it from the bill. Again, without our asking (or demanding) the credit.  We will definitely return, knowing they go that extra mile.",

    "text": "\"Paco's Grandma's Flan\"=Worth the flight from Seattle. I think they are really trying to make an impression. The food is great. This coming from a dude who grew up in the San Joaquin and knows what is and is not good Mexican cuisine. The place is off strip and was extremely slow on a Saturday afternoon in January. I had the carnitas torta and it was very good. It was not awesome until I added the pickled veggies on the side to the sandwich. The carnitas is sufficiently mild and flavorful that the light seasoning is probably the right approach. However, it just didn't fire all the cylinders for me until the zing of the pickled veggies (I think it was carrots, jalapenos, Anaheims, onions, and coriander greens) was added to the kit. I appreciate slow-cooked flavor and subtle fatty mild goodness but for a torta you may as well go all in. Jesse was our server and he was awesome. He took responsibility for the place and owned the experience. Congenial, professional, personal, and honest. Jesse was a lot more than I expected from the establishment connected to one of the world's largest stripper joints! This place is not to be missed. We walked there from the strip which was about a 15 minute investment just in getting there. Worth the walk and the exercise helped to ease the levity of \"Paco's Grandma's Flan\" which was, in all honesty, the crowning work of everything we ate while in Vegas. Get down to El Dorado people.",

Our server Layla was friendly, prompt, kind, and attentive. A better server could not be.   Refried beans.  Often forgettable, this side really stands out here. They're delicious.   Salsa selection. The trio of salsas are excellent.   Chile Relleno. Damn near perfect.    Flan. It's not what I would consider a traditional Flan, but it is delicious nonetheless.   So-So:  Rice: Coulda been better. Serviceable, but was served cold   Margaritas.  They're fine, but lacked spark.   The Bad:  Tacos. Yup, terrible, what they should be a highlight at was an unmitigated disaster. Cold, flavorless, dry chicken.  Tepid , boring, al pastor, and carne asada not fit for a lunch truck.  At $4 a piece, these were a terrible disappointment.   Pricing. Good Lord, one pays a hefty sum for some great to terrible food.  If you're local, Mondays are the day to come.  There's a discount that will make this restaurant a more reasonable outing.  At a reduced price tag, I would go to get the good bits, but I would not be interested in returning at full price.",

He cooks healthy as well quality  Non-GMO ingredients. For example, the flan is made with organic eggs and natural cane sugar.  And if you have a flare for exotic cuisine, there are sauteed grasshoppers on the menu.   The margaritas are the bomb plesantly poured by server Alcia.  Monday is 50% off for locals and Tuesday is 50% off for industry as well. There are specials throughout  the whole week!  Genius paring with the two establishments by Peter and Dan Feinstein!",

It's some of the BEST Mexican food in Vegas. (I feel like a real boob for making that joke.)  Once inside though, you'll forget it's next to a titty bar. The atmosphere is a really chill type, where it can be casual with friends or intimate with a special someone, but enough about that... the FOOD. OMG so good. I was really torn as to what to order, there was so much good stuff on the menu. I finally settled on the breakfast burrito, and it was fantastic. Paired with a good stiff margarita, it was absolutely exceptional.  The service was phenomenal, and the Chef himself even came out to make sure everything was to our liking, especially Emijandro's flan. We will most certainly be back here.  Until the next review, ta-tas! (Singular. Dang, another boob joke. I feel like an absolute tit.)",

I stopped by with my 7 yr old daughter and husband for a late lunch today and had my socks knocked off by the quality of the food. We came by after attending a pumpkin patch in the rain and when the gps guided us into the sapphire club parking lot, I thought that the restaurant was inside the gentleman's club.  But no,  it is a separate entrance to the left of the club entrance...... And worth the trip.   I will be going back.    The kids meal menu is $6 and includes a decadent churro + chocolate cinnamon sauce dessert, more than that, the bean and cheese burrito that came with my daughter's selection was, in her words, \"yummy!\"  She says that her favorite part was the tortilla,  and I have to agree,  the tortillas here have that flakey crunch that is so good.  I had the lettuce wraps and accidentally cleaned my plate.... I usually can't finish a restaurant meal,  but this was tasty and not heavy and well....I looked down and there was very little left.  My husband had the pulled chicken burrito and it was excellent too.  The chicken was succulent and nicely spiced.  An item I will go back for too (he gave me a small bite).  All in all I recommend this restaurant to anyone who is fond of good eating in a calm atmosphere....I did not have the opportunity to try any bar drinks but the margaritas at the table next door looked very tempting.....  I could see this place being a great evening place for a non kid crowd.",

The beans were dry, like out of a can. The chips were most definitely out of a bag. The chicken tacos were tasteless. The rice was a gooey buttery mess. Seems to me this restaurant survives on hype and tourists. It was completely overpriced, and not worth it, whatsoever.",

Over priced for not  being on strip... Asked for more tortillas,  was charged extra for those as well..Will never be back... 3 appetizers, 3 drinks $100 without tip...BOO!

I had the shrimp cocktail I wasn't too much a fan of it but I prefer my shrimp with steroids and a lot larger and I prefer them American style instead of the Mexican style of being in the cocktail sauce when they are served. So no knock on them just my preference and first time having it served Mexican style. Chicken enchiladas were very good great flavor and spice. Wife had veggie tacos they were also very good but they were 7$ a taco. I'd say a little overpriced compared to what's out there but then organic food tends to run a lot higher as a whole.  Sangria was good as well.  It's def a happening place so make reservations on the weekends.",

    "text": "This place is literally a diamond in the rough. Off the beaten path of the Strip and located next door to a gentlemen's club, you would not expect to find such a classy, well maintained restaurant offering so many fresh, GMO-free, vegetarian choices... that is also open 24/7!  For starters, the food is outstanding. I'm a vegetarian, my mom is a strict vegan with nut allergies, and my dad, boyfriend, and brother are big ol' dinosaurs who love meat. There is literally something for everyone, with vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free choices identified on the menu. The signature veggie tacos are the best, with the cheese grilled right on the tortilla and overflowing with sauteed veggies like zucchini and squash. The table side guacamole is massive, but we somehow still manage to devour all of it every single time. It's a must-order!  I've been to El Dorado Cantina several times and have always had consistently good service. The restaurant is clean and well-tended to, albeit a little dimly lit/straight up dark. It's perhaps better suited for a date night or dinner with friends than a casual family lunch, but eh, no big deal. When they first opened, they had lots of good deals for locals and those in the industry, but I think those have tapered out as they grew more popular. Still, the prices are reasonable, even without the heavy discounts.   My only complaint is that I've yet to get a good, solid margarita from them. It's always too weak or too strong. (I'll keep trying! Ha!)  As far as Mexican places in Vegas go, it is second only to my favorite restaurant of all time, Frank & Fina's Cocina. Still, we highly recommend this place and plan to go back again soon.",

The waiter overheard us saying it was her birthday and he even surprised her with a free Flan dessert!! Although our food took awhile to come out, he apologized and was attentive. My friend got the Vegetarian burrito; a must-try for Vegetarians! I had the pozole...it was amazinggg! It even came with a side of this spicy/sweet chili sauce to put in the soup; it gave it such an interesting, yet delicious flavor! I've also recommend the street tacos as well! The carne asada meat is so fresh! The only downside from this visit was the flan; mine was great but my friends' flan were undercooked, runny, and still tasted of alcohol. Other than that, I definitely recommend El Dorado's! :)",

Our waiter Chris was very friendly and was constantly checking in with us in a very timely manner. I ordered the steak and shrimp fajitas and My husband and father-in-law ordered the street tacos. The steak was so tender and well marinated. I would recommend this place to everyone who visits Las Vegas. I will definitely be coming back.",

One of the best Mexican restaurants I've ever been to, quite possibly the best. And the executive chef brought out our dessert and was really cool. Also, the flan is his grandma's recipe and is TO DIE FOR! I highly recommend this place! (It should also be noted that the worlds largest gentleman a club is right next door, just to give some fare warning. Although you'd never guess once inside the classy, perfect atmosphere of El Dorado Cantina.)",

So we begin walking, and walking, annddd walking. First suggestion, do not walk. It is off the strip and we went at night, very sketchy just because of the isolation and the multiple limos pulling up to offer to take us free to strip clubs. Speaking of strip clubs, we then approach a sign for the 'largest strip club' in Vegas, we were confused on where our restaurant was as it should have been where the light up signs and limos for the strip club were approaching.  Yes, this restaurant is in the same building as a massive strip club, the entrance to the restaurant is next door to the entrance of the club. Don't let that put you off though! Food was good. Street tacos were excellent and the rice and beans were YUM!! Service was great, very friendly. Would definitely recommend, just be aware of the location if you are bringing the kids or conservative family members. Oh, and uber a ride back.",

Server said it was tomatillo, yet it was red and I've only ever seen green tomatillos.  Delicious and not your usual tomato-onion-garlic-cilantro-lime affair.    Chapulines (lime & garlic)-- Texture was nice, flavor was too sour.  Opt for the chili flavor instead.    Street Corn--Sweet, salty, crunchy, blackened just enough.    Street Tacos--Mix and match to get a variety of flavors.    Flan--Easily the best item on the menu.  We only ordered it because it came free with the yelp check-in.  It was IMMENSE.  More like creme brule than flan.  Very rich and creamy.    Come for the salsa, stay for the flan.",

The perfect punctuation to my delicious dinner was the flan which was absolutely decadent and creamy.

Super fresh w/ all of their sources named on the menu.  They had a lot of gluten-free options, too, which was great for my gluten-free friend.  We had table-side guacamole, queso w/ organic chorizo, and most of us had tacos of some sort for our entree.  Salsas that came w/ the chips were delicious as well as all of our food.  We were all very happy w/ our lunch.  The fruit margaritas were made w/ organic fruit purees and were super yummy.    Good service.  There was no one there when we arrived for early lunch at 11AM on a Saturday.  Perfect food for a hangover or no hangover!",

We sat there for a few minutes and were given water and chips and salsa to begin with. We were told so and so \"guys name\" would be with us in just a minute to take our drink order. We sat there for at LEAST twenty minutes before we had our margaritas in front of us. Meanwhile a girl comes up to us and takes our drink order and asks us if we are ready to order. We told her we wanted to start with a pitcher of margaritas and a tableside guacamole, she came over with the guacamole cart and a big lava rock molcajete to make it in. I was excited! She proceeded to prepare our guac, still no drinks! My boyfriend and I were getting anxious for our margaritas so we started paying more attention to the bartender and saw that he was on and off the computer and yes doing his job, but very visibly with no sense of urgency. The girl making our guac finished and made sure we had everything we needed. We then proceeded to eat our guac which was nothing special and still NO DRINKS! Finally we look over to the bartender and we see him on the phone and preparing what looked like to be our pitcher of margaritas. I will say it again, after at LEAST twenty minutes we finally had our drinks and you would think after a wait like that the margaritas would be awesome, but it was the contrary, the margaritas were a flop.   By this time my boyfriend was feeling irritable because of the non professional demeanor of the bartender and the long wait for the drinks. So we moved to a table to feel more comfortable. And this is coming from people that never sit in the dining room, we always prefer to sit at the bar. Anyway, I had the carne asada and honestly it was the freaking best carne asada I've ever had. It was amazing and the whole dish was put together with perfection and it even came with a bit of chorizo which was a nice touch. My boyfriend had the tacos; his order actually came out wrong but we didn't say anything, he ended up getting one of the pastor, one of the carnitas, and one of the cochinitas tacos. He liked them and had no issues. The manager on duty made it a point to come over and talk with us about our experience and also the head chef came to our table. This is the reason I am giving them four stars. The management really cares and made it a point to come and see how our experience was going. We mentioned to Chef that our margaritas were no good and immediately the manager came back to the table and offered us a margarita on the house. We declined because we weren't going to make a fuss but we really appreciated the gesture. All in all our experience was really a three star rating because of how it started. But by the end we give it a four star rating because our food was amazing and the management really saved the night. This is a place I would visit again, the food, the ambiance and management staff are great.",

The Mahi burrito was out of this world & I would go back just for that alone! We were celebrating a birthday so they gave us free flan & loaned a big sombrero to make the birthday special. Our server Lindsay was very friendly & just an all around sweetheart! The location is a little peculiar considering it shares an entrance with a gentleman's club, but who cares where it is when you're getting great service & amazing food!!",

It's never happened.  And my hubby..Mr Picky totally agrees.  We split the chicken and steak fajitas.  INCREDIBLE.  We both agreed (we don't usually agree on food) they were the best fajitas we've ever had.  AND we both agreed...hahaha..that the chicken was the best.  Lindsay was a absolutely wonderful waitress too!!  The location leaves a little bit to be desired, but the restaurant itself is clean and classy.

First off when we got there the setting was absolutely beautiful, the server was very well detailed in his menu knowledge. According to being certified as an organic restaurant, it has got to be 75%, well they are 85%. My friend and I shared a pitcher of margaritas, they were so delicious and strong. And then my boyfriend and I shared seafood enchiladas and tacos. The El Pastor was probably the best. The only thing that I think is a little strange is it is right next to Sapphire strip club. But do not be confused they are not affiliated, the restaurant is a family-oriented place. As a local here in Las Vegas I would definitely recommend this place whether you are visiting Vegas or just a local looking for a good spot to eat. Easy to get to off of the Interstate 15 and service is well and prices are great. I will definitely be back.",

It was our first time here and came on a recommendation.  Sat down and the chips and salsa was good.  I was looking forward to the meal, as usually if the salsa is good, the food is good.    In this case, they bring red and green fire roasted salsas.  I ordered the pozole.  What a disappointment: it was greasy, very salty and the chips that came with it, covered the onion and cabbage.  They didn't bring lime, so used the ones from my beer.  Tried to skim as much grease as I could into a plastic container they brought with the pozole, but it wasn't very good.  Another person ordered the milanesa torta and returned it because it was dry and over salted.  Another person in our group, ordered a shrimp bowl with brown rice, but it came with  the cilantro-llime white rice.  Won't go back.",

    "text": "I'm hesitant to hype it up too much and let the cat out of the bag, but this place is easily one of the best-kept secrets in Vegas right now. The only thing to complain about is the location, as it shares a building and parking lot with the infamous Sapphire strip club.   Sure, El Dorado Cantina has a separate entrance from \"the world's largest gentleman's club,\" but the walk up to the front door can be a little awkward if you're with children, a first date, your parents, or a business acquaintance -- especially if they're the opposite sex. Trust me, though -- Once you walk inside, you'll totally forget there's nothing but a red wall that separates the restaurant from 70,000 sq ft of topless women.  Previously a sushi house, El Dorado Cantina has been totally upgraded and remodeled and now features a sophisticated decor with a cool vibe and a great ambiance. The interior includes rich brown woods, hand-woven red wall coverings, several antique-looking mirrors, and wrought-iron light fixtures with soft lighting. The bar also offers more than 100 tequilas, Horchata, multiple types of sangria, and several house-made juices including pineapple, hibiscus, watermelon and more.   The great food and exceptional service are what truly distinguish this restaurant from other Mexican spots, however. Chef Paco routinely visits the tables to speak with his patrons and many of the items are prepared table side for your pleasure (including the margaritas and guacamole). I've tried a different menu item each time I've dined here and truly enjoyed everything I've experienced.  The flavors in the food really pop out and make a profound statement, and I guarantee you'll have a hard time deciding what to eat after you read the extensive and enticing menu. I've visited El Dorado Cantina multiple times and dined with groups as large as 15, yet I've never heard anything but compliments from my friends and colleagues. This Mexican restaurant is a definite palate pleaser.",

There are parking lots on either side of the building, and my taxi dropped me off at the one opposite the restaurant so it took a bit of searching. The restaurant is pretty nice on the inside. Service wise, my server was nice but working the cleavage and throwing out a lot of \"baby\" and \"hun\". Seems the strip club vibe has bled over...  The chips and salsa were OK. None of the three salsas were particularly tasty. I wanted to order the guacamole but was eating alone and it was $16. $16? Seriously? I wonder how many avocados they use...  I got the Carne Asada burrito, and while the flavors were spot-on, it came out at room temperature. Could've been awesome if it was actually hot but was almost cold by the time I finished.  Not a bad meal, but probably not worth leaving the strip. Somehow doubt this is the best Mexican food Vegas has to offer.",

It could've been better if it wasn't so dry. It came with rice and beans and I have to say the rice is possible the best rice I have ever had (and I eat a lot of rice).",

After tonight's visit, there is no doubt in my mind that it is a stand out winner.   I decided to come in right after work and lucky for me, it was happy hour. Street tacos at $2.50 each is crazy for the quality. I had the pulled chicken, al pastor, carne asada, and cochinita. They were all delicious. The tequila list is ridiculous. The fact that they carry Corazon Sazerac Aged and Van Winkle Expressions is a plus. I'm normally a browns fan, so I'll take it.  I tend to gravitate towards the bar when I visit. I have to say that Joseph is a phenomenal bartender. His jalapeno margarita and paloma knockoff are well balanced and delicious.   I'm not a fan of Mexican food, but when I do crave it, I think about this place first.",

    "text": "El Dorado Cantina is such a great find on my trip to Vegas. Quality ingredients, beautiful dark interior, great staff, amazing Mexican food.   The Imperial Shrimp appetizer was so good, and presented beautifully.   The White Sangria was interesting, the liquer they added made it a bit too sweet and smooth in the mouth for me but that's just a preference.   I found the Jalapeno Margarita a bit uninspiring; tasty and not too spicy, it was totally fine and you'll probably like it--I just have impossibly high standards. I will try the house margarita next time. Which might be tomorrow. Definitely need to get back here before we leave.  The Pacos mole sampler knocked it out of the park. It's rare to find green pumpkin seed mole in restaurants let alone of this quality. The traditional chocolate mole was hands down the best I've ever had... and mole is my thing. I get it everywhere I go.   The flan was a table pleaser. I'm not a flan expert so I can't say much more than I liked it, but my dining companions were enthusiastic about it.   Our server Enrique was warm and friendly and gave us excellent service.  With its emphasis on organic and non-gmo ingredients, this restaurant is at the leading edge and deserves our support. Please come try it and make it a success! The food is worth it!",

This time for the house salad, posole, and various street tacos. Don't be dissuaded by the location and attachment to Sapphire strip club. They have a separate entrance. Ivan served us twice so far. He's welcoming, witty, and makes great recommendations. An easygoing, straight forward dining experience. And open 24 hours so no excuse not to go. I do recommend Uber or a cab. And ask for Ivan if he's around. And addendum, the flan is fantastic.",

Got dropped off but realized the restaurant is next to the club which we felt a little better about.  It was after midnight, staff apologized for being short staffed however we didnt feel that way at all! Stella was wonderful took care of us and had great suggestions.  We had the fajita bowl with steak delicious and pabil pork tacos, wow so much flavor!  We were stuffed but somehow made room for the flan... we are not flan eaters at all, complete opposites really. Stella said it would be nothing like we were used to and she was right again delicious!  Definitely worth coming in and trying! (Apologies for not taking pictures of the food, we realized we didnt after we finished)",

    "text": "Wanting authentic Mexican food? How about non-GMO, organic and natural Mexican food?  In what may be one of True oddest locations, the east side of the same building Sapphires gentleman's club is located in, is one of the best Mexican restaurants I've eaten at in a long time! Other than the shared parking lot, the club doesn't come into play.  The restaurant is clean, has high top and booth seating, as well as seating at the bar.  Some of the seating is a little dark for my own preference, but could be considered romantic too.  Full bar with Coke products.  They had music videos playing on some of the flat screens, as well as some sports on other TVs.    The menu is quite comprehensive and had plenty to choose from.  Mexican food to burgers, breakfast foods to dinner and everything between.  Prices are moderate- not an economy meal by any means, but not crazy expensive either.  I will definitely be back multiple times to try other menu items.  The service here is top notch, and like many other Mexican places in Las Vegas, they bring you complimentary chips and 2 types of salsas, and water when you sit down.  Their Imperial Shrimp appetizer was insanely good.  Shrimp stuffed with seafood, wrapped in bacon and lightly fried to perfection, served on a bed of cabbage and pineapple chunks.  This dish alone is enough for me to go back again!  The double cheeseburger and potatoes were very good.  As was the Seafood Enchiladas.  Serving sizes were generous!  PS - I have no idea what's truly authentic Mexican food or not, but he food tasted great AND the service was also great!",

We found el Dorado Cantina on yelp and had a feeling we'd be in for a treat based on the amazing reviews. Our waitress, Stella, was amazing. She was so helpful with her recommendations and one of the most hospitable people we have had the pleasure of meeting. Let me start off by saying if you are looking for the world's best guacamole, THIS is the place. The taste is beyond words. Even better is that they make it right in front of you. I ordered the guacamole and the carne asada tacos and was completely blown away. Even the rice and retried beans were unreal! I kept looking at my husband in shock at how incredible everything was. I'm so satisfied and the next time I'm in Vegas which won't be for another 8 months, this will be one of my first spots. What a gem of a restaurant. Also- I'm not one to be fond of micheladas BUT HOLY COW- Those were incredible as well! If you don't visit here while in Vegas, I am so sorry for your loss. Can't wait to come back!  Thank you, Stella! We'll see you next time!",

My family and I were very confused when pulling up wondering where this place was, if we got the wrong address, and if the restaurant was inside the strip club. It was a very funny 5 minutes until we realized the entrance was hidden behind a tree next to the club. I'll start by saying that I am from Mexican & from LA, so GOOD Mexican food is hard to come by when you are out of your realm. But this was truly the worst I've ever had. The meat tasted like canned meat or dog food. Not a single person in my family enjoyed their meal. And not to mention this place is pretty pricey. So overall it was a huge disappointment to us. I would give the place negative stars for food, but I am adding stars because the service was good. I do not recommend this place at all unless you're into cheap tasting food that's overpriced.",

The food was pretty good. The Aguachiles was okay. It is served in a martini glass and unfortunately the flavors accumulate at the bottom instead of with the shrimp. The huevos rancheros were very good, too.   A note in authenticity of the food. The rice is just white rice with some cilantro. The salsa were all very good. And finally, they use queso fresco, not yellow cheese some Mexican restaurants use.   Not worth a cab ride from the strip.",

    "text": "Pretty difficult to find, if it's your first time be aware that it's attached to Sapphire strip club. You have to drive into the strip club parking lot to see it. We drove around a few times looking for the entrance as there are no road signs or any indicators of the restaurant visible from the street at night.   Overall, I think it was mediocre Mexican food and what you're really paying for is the ambiance and atmosphere, which is nice. If you haven't really had authentic Mexican you might be impressed, but living in San Diego just miles from the border, we have it in abundance and this place doesn't hold a candle to many back home.   I had the street tacos al pastor. 3 small white corn tortillas. The pork was pretty bland and sprinkled with cilantro and finely diced pineapples. It was okay, but I could find much better at a street vendor in SoCal for half the price. It also came with a side of black or pinto beans and rice. The rice is a joke. I'm not sure what they're going for but it has no influence of Mexican flavoring whatsoever. Usually you expect the characteristic red/orange tomatoey rice with Mexican food. This was just plain, bland white rice. Black beans were also lacking any flavor as if they came straight out of a can. We also got the beef enchiladas. They were a little better. The shredded beef was a little dried out, if it were moist and succulent it would've made the dish. Enchiladas were as expected with a pretty good kick from the spicy red sauce.   As far as service, I thought the general manager seemed very nice but the waitress we had seemed insincere and as if she wanted to be somewhere else. It was a quiet night and we were seated immediately, but given how few people were there I think the food shouldn't have taken so long to come out.   Anyway, in summary I was less than impressed at the quality of food for such a highly-reviewed place on Yelp. One of the very few times Yelp has gotten it wrong for me. The ambiance and atmosphere is nice but the food is not up to the same standard. I'm open-minded enough to consider maybe it was the fact it was a Sunday night and hence not their best staff. Or maybe it was what I ordered. I went for the regular menu tacos/enchiladas, maybe the specialities were a lot better? Either way, this place failed to come close to my expectations.  DISCLAIMER - I'd probably give this place a 3/5 but I feel the overall rating is so misleadingly that I'm giving it one less star to try and even out the distribution.",

In addition, the executive Chef Paco came out to say hello to the group and that made us feel special. Get the table side guacamole....it is so smooth! The chicken breast fajitas were delicious!!! Thank you guys! You rock!  Chris",

It's a hidden gem--not on the Strip and not where locals tend to go. That said, the restaurant does treat locals with special appreciation, even offering 25% off the entire bill on Mondays.   This is one of the few restaurants in town that uses exclusively free-range and locally-grown ingredients that are free from antibiotics, pesticides, and steroids. This is True for their produce, dairy, meat, and chips.  The food is beautiful on every plate with robust flavors and delectable textures. The chef is eager to talk with his customers to hear their feedback and just shoot-the-breeze. He's truly personable and a joy to talk with in the nicely decorated interior of the building.

We've come here for locals night (Monday's where you get 25% off the entire bill - BAR SEATING ONLY) and on a weekday during lunch.   Personally, the discount is great, but I prefer to come here for lunch on a Wednesday when it's not so packed and I can enjoy my meal. You'd imagine since it's by a strip club that the place would be raunchy, but it's nothing like that! It's clean, professional and just like a normal restaurant.   El Dorado Cantina is located just off the strip on Sammy Davis Jr. Drive. It's right next door to Saphire. There's ample parking, but you may have to walk far if the strip club is busy. When you first walk in there's a nice hostess who'll take you to your seat. They also accept reservations if you call ahead. Besides coming on Locals night, we typically sit at a comfy round booth that can seat up to 6 people.   FOOD - We had the following:   1. Tableside Guacamole w/ Chips: This is my favorite. It's so simple yet complicated at the same time. The server makes the guacamole right in front of you. However, you can give the server feedback on what you want in your guac. You get to taste test it and they'll adjust it! Take however long you want. Definitely have fun w/ this and try different mixtures. For your first try, I'd go w/ what the server recommends. Then you can tweak it the next time you go. For me, I always want extra lime!   2. Imperial Shrimp: Wild Pacific shrimp wrapped in bacon & lightly fried, stuffed with seafood. Served with chipotle ranch dressing. The shrimp was cooked perfectly (I hate overcooked shrimp) and the bacon wrapped around the shrimp was crispy. What really completes the dish is the chipotle ranch dressing. It's soooo good! I wish I could take this home w/ me and put it in all my sandwiches.   3. Cactus tacos: Not my favorite. I wouldn't get this again. We wanted to try something new that we'd never had. I don't like the texture of the cactus. The flavor was good, but it was lacking a crunch. If I could get this taco on a hardshell tortilla then I believe I'd enjoy it more.   4. Chile Verde Pork w/ Chicharron: This is one of my favorites. It comes w/ two pork tacos. The pork is so tender and I love the added crunch from the chicharron in this taco. This is big enough for two to share when you get an appetizer or you can enjoy it by itself as a full meal when you add the cilantro rice and beans on the side.   5. Chapulines: I never knew how crunchy grasshoppers are!! Like I said earlier, I love lime so we always get the garlic lime grasshoppers. It's a great dish to munch on while you wait for the rest of your food to arrive and it won't fill you up too much either!   6. Paco's Grandma's Flan: HIGHLY RECOMMEND. It's a great way to end the meal! It's a fairly large piece of flan too. It's denser than most and the syrup on the flan isn't too sweet. It's just right! It's also gluten free and vegetarian.   SERVICE   Excellent service from beginning to end. :-)   PRICE  Some of the items are a bit overpriced, but I can understand why since they're a non-GMO restaurant. They also have a huge selection of vegetarian and gluten-free items.   For the Chile Verde Pork Taco plate, they charge $14 for two tacos, which is pretty steep! Then you have to pay an extra $2.50 for the rice and beans. The place is good, but I sometimes don't feel everything on the menu is worth that much. I don't recommend you come here if you're on a budget.   Overall, I give this restaurant 4 stars. The food is good very tasty w/ many unique dishes that you can't get in Las Vegas, but it's overpriced. This restaurant is great for vegetarians and those who desire great tasting gluten free dishes as well. The service is excellent. The location is off the strip so it's not busy or in a high traffic area. There's also free parking too!  Happy Dining,   JT",

    "text": "I first visited here with my mom on June 22. Everything was good (aside from the sangria). We got chicken sopes, shrimp taquitos, 2 cocktails and did the mobile check in for free dessert. I was so impressed with the food that on July 2 my fiance and I went. When we walked in, there was no one at the host stand. We waited a few minutes and a older gentleman finally came up and got us seated. We began looking over the menus, decided on drinks and apps. No one  had been by yet. After about 7 minutes, the host who sat us brought by waters and chips and salsa. He apologized and said our server would be right over. They weren't busy at all, but we waited. Another 10 plus minutes went by and no one had come over. We were almost out of chips and salsa and had not seen a server (though the host continued to sit the booths near us and a manager walked about the restaurant, clueless). We were sliding out of the booth when a server came to our table.  She apolgized, stating she just walked into work. As a server for 11 years myself, to me this ment the host was sitting an empty section and the manger has no idea what is going on during her shift to see this. We ordered. I seen the manager walk by and I flagged her down. I asked why we sat there for nearly 20 minutes not being greeted. She looked like a child with her hand in the cookie jar. She responded what? I repeated myself. She had no real response, responded in a stutter (she seemed shocked someone would confront her). Finally she said \"Well what do you want? A free dessert?\" I told her no, just wondering why she or no one else noticed us and two other booths went without being greeted for a significant time. She walked away and never came back by to ask how the food was.  The food was delicious, as it was the first time. I thought I had found a new spot but I guess not. Good food and bad management isn't enough for me to be back. As a manager you need to be aware what sections are closed and open and if your staff is overwhelmed, you should help them. The food is 5 stars but service was lacking the 2nd time.",

    "text": "I expected more from this place probably because of all the hype with  the chef having competed on network tv shows. I really didn't get that \"wow\" factor.  Place was next to a \"gentleman's club\" so that was a surprise. But it appear clean and well kept- from what we could <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsee.it&s=b4bd37a4fc45dbe4c895fd954fb861a7ec90e4a6c42b3f5a764ba0fda3eb4f63\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">see.it</a> was very dimly lit- probably to create ambiance. Our dinner was at 7:30pm.  It was not crowded yet so we could have probably got a table for 2 without our reservation.   Service was less than par. Took a while before anyone even took our drink order and they did not even ask if we wanted water. We got the typical chips and salsa. Red salsa was ok- had ok flavor could not tell if it was homemade; no heat. They did not have an extensive beer menu and mostly margaritas like any mexican restaurant. We ordered a michelada and a Cadillac margarita. They were your typical drinks nothing special.  We ordered the queso fundido, the al pastor and octopus tacos with rice and beans. The queso fundido was ehh.. we did not taste much of the chorizo and the cheese lacked flavor- coming from California where we have many authentic mexican restaurants with great food- this queso seemed like it was made with some kind of blend- it was just bland, no punch of flavor. They did not use like a Oaxaca cheese.   The al pastor street tacos were ok. The meat had good flavor. The pineapple was a good touch. the octopus chorizo tacos lacked flavor. Octopus was tender though - the chorizo just didn't  fulfill the expected spicy smokey flavor we are used to. The cilantro-lime rice l with cked flavor as well just tasted like plain steamed rice...and the refried beans didn't  even have some queso fresco which could've added a lil extra punch to flavor. Don't think 3 little tacos were worth the $they asked for.   We did not  order dessert   Overall- this place didn't  really live up to our expectations.  Food was overall just ok. Did not have much to offer in the flavor department- seasoned well but just lacked that over the top kick to it. Service was mediocre espexially with the place not so busy at the time. Pricing was as expected though for a tourist town with a chef who is recognized as one of the best in the industry.",

    "text": "My last outing here was fine on the whole, but there were some discordant notes.    Tableside Guac was very good but noticeably salty, while Albondigas Soup was excellent, with savory meatballs standing out in a hot vegetable-oriented broth.  Although Imperial Shrimp wrapped in bacon and lightly fried was a good starter, I believe the dish would taste better without the fish stuffing.    My main of a slow cooked Carnitas Rajas Burrito, packed with marinated pork and Cilantro Rice, roasted peppers, Refried Beans, fresh Guacamole, a Mexican blend of three cheeses, and Avocado Salsa in a warm Flour Tortilla, featured tender carnitas and was both filling and satisfying.  But I would have liked more Pico de Gallo and a saucier burrito.  And a mound of Cilantro Rice on the side, outside the burrito, seemed superfluous.    Seating was comfortable but there was not a heavy server presence, and the waiters who attended our table kept switching.   At meal's end I had to ask two different servers for the check, and the men's restroom was messy.  Nevertheless, because the food here is noticeably fresh, clean, and composed of high quality ingredients, and is available 24 hours, El Dorado Cantina is an asset to the Las Vegas Mexican cuisine dining scene, and worth another look.  3-1/2 Stars overall on this visit.",

I start the review this way because I had I not seen a mention of it in someone else's review, I'm not sure we would have ever found it.  :)  The signage for the strip club way overwhelms the signage for El Dorado.    It is literally right next door (same building) as the strip club.  It's also open 24 hours which to me is usually a sign of Waffle House/Denny's quality but this idea is actually genius.  People go to strip clubs at all hours of every day.  Having good Mexican food mere steps from the door is a stroke of brilliance.    Pre-meal chips and salsa were delish and my margarita was interesting and well-made.  My cheese enchiladas were fantastic and the service was yummy.    It does make me wonder though...  do the strippers next door smell like refried beans?",

After you get past the fact that it shares a building with Sapphires Gentleman's Club (separate entrances) you can enjoy all of El Dorado's deliciousness!  Not sure if its because the food is non GMO and as much as possible locally sourced; but on both occasions everything has been very flavorful and tasty!  One of my favorite Mexican restaurants! On Monday is Local Appreciation with 25% off the bill including alcohol and don't forget to check in for a free Flan! Both times coming here I have gotten the 3 street tacos with various meats so I could try the different ones.  I liked the Pulled Chicken and the Carnitas the best.  Each one is filled to the max and I have left overs for the next day.   Hubby has gotten the same thing both times also; Pulled Chicken Burrito enchilada style (green) which is NOT on the menu.  On our first visit our waiter suggested it, as it was his favorite.  My husband also loved the Cilantro Rice. Will have to come during Happy Hour next to check it out!

The description on the menu was very misleading, other than that the service was great and we even got 25% off because it was on a Monday and we happen to be locals. The flan was good and the habanero salsa was FIRE. The 25% kinda made up for the disappointment maybe we'll be back but it'll definitely be on a Monday! Please use better ingredient for the seafood enchiladas!!!",

    "text": "El Dorado is located directly next door to Sapphire Gentlemen's club. The restaurant itself is very nice and the service was also very good. With that being said, I was somewhat disappointed with my first dining experience. First grievance is that the music in the restaurant is way too loud. You literally have to scream at the person next to you to have a conversation. It was hard to genuinely enjoy a meal with friends because the noise level was so distracting. Second, the food portion sizes are way too small for the amount that they are. I ordered shrimp tacos ($16.00) which were two corn tortilla tacos a la cart. To add rice (plain white rice)  and beans (refried or black) is an extra $3.00. I asked for a side of chipotle sauce and that was an extra $2.00. After all was said and done I walked out with $21.00 tacos and was still hungry. I couldn't help but feel ripped off after eating here.",

    "text": "This place is real Mexican food with a 2014 healthy twist.  They just opened their doors on July 19 and open 24 hours...Yum!   Location: Yelp reviewers were right about sharing the parking lot with a strip club but I hope folks don't let that stop them from coming here with their kids and families.  I went with my husband and 16-year-old son.  There's also plenty of parking.  Ambience:  Tastefully decorated.  Large booths and tables.  Also has a large bar and the drinks are perfectly made to compliment the food. I ordered a margarita.   Service: Alessandro was our waiter.  He is very attentive, friendly but professional.  He made us feel like we were family.  I loved that the other waiters would check on us, too.  I hate going to a place and the only person servicing your table is your waiter.  It felt like everyone is looking out for each other and most of all the customers.   Food: Let's start with the chips and 3 amazing fresh made salas - mild, medium and HOT!  I loved them all but the hot just exploded with flavor.  We were told about the fresh made juices and I was torn between ordering the margarita or the juice.  To my surprise, one of the waiters came out with a small sample of the pineapple juice and it was superb.  What a treat.  My husband and I shared steak and chicken fajitas which were perfectly seasoned and tender.  The portion was great for sharing.  My son had the breakfast chorizo burrito which comes with fresh potato slices.   He said it exceeded his expectations and wasn't planning on sharing any of it.  He devoured it all.    Dessert: My son got the tres leches cake. It was moist but not soggy.  Chef Paco treated my husband and I to a sample of the flan.  It has sweet and had 4 distinct flavors.  We typical don't order dessert and I recommend that you not pass up dessert because you have got to try either of these.  Chef Paco: He is down to earth and his food is inspired by the recipes that his mother and grandmother taught him.   We were lucky to find this gem and look forward to returning soon and exploring more items on the menu.",

Jesse explained the menu, made sure we were taken care of from start to finish...and he makes a mean fresh pineapple margarita (so good!!). Then, Chef Paco came out to check on us himself. Pretty amazing touch to an already fantastic dinner. Everything Chef Paco makes is homemade - from the tortilla chips, salsas (no cans), and tableside guac to the entrees and dessert. A word about dessert: you must get the flan, even if you think you hate it (because we do). It is like nothing you've ever tried. WOW!  Don't be scared off by the location. It's next to a gentleman's club. The restaurant sign is kind of hidden behind trees as you drive up so you can't see it right away from the street. The restaurant is classy and very clean.  I can't say enough good things about El Dorado. Dining there is not just a meal, it's an experience. If you live in Vegas, you are lucky! If you're visiting, this is a must visit.",

    "text": "El Dorado Cantina is a month shy of its grand opening, yet it's already a gem. I was eager to try it after such promising reviews. I had read it is next to Sapphire, but I didn't take it literally. I should have, because it is indeed in the same building but with its own entrance. The restaurant is upscale and our group of four were cozy in a booth.   We started with house margaritas and cold cervezas. We were quickly brought chips and three types of salsa: mild, tomatillo and habanero. All were fresh and delicious. We couldn't resist the tableside guacamole ($12). It did not disappoint!   Moving on to entrees, we tried the carne asada burrito ($12.50), carnitas tacos ($7.50, seafood enchilada ($13.50) and Milaneza ($17.50). Everything was fresh and tasty. We were all very pleased.  They are currently offering specials and happy hours; hopefully, they will continue. It's been a long time, since I've had an enjoyable sit down meal in a Mexican Restaurant. You wouldn't expect a restaurant of this caliber given the location, but it delivers. I'm already planning my next visit.",

    "text": "If you can get over the fact that an amazing restaurant is sharing walls with a popular strip club, you'll find yourself enjoying some great Mexican recipes and refreshing drink options.  I really enjoyed the tableside guacamole and fresh chips. The guacamole was fresh and spicy! This is huge - because I've had paste guacamole that tastes like it is dispensed from a plastic bag and mixed with excessive lime juice. This was not the case here at El Dorado Cantina.  The street tacos were awesome. The night I was there they were all you can eat. I have since heard that the all you can eat street tacos are no longer offered. This is unfortunate. The word was the restaurant was losing money on them. Maybe management needs to think of things differently - as I came to El Dorado because I had heard of the all you can eat street tacos.   The street taco's come in six different selection choices. They pride themselves on all organic meet, herbs, and vegetables. My favorite was the Al Pastor, which is organic marinated pork with organic pineapple, onion, lime, and cilantro. My second favorite was the Carne Asada. This had organic steak, onion, lime, cilantro, and guacamole. You can also try the Carnitas, Pulled Chicken Cochinita, and Corn Rajas.  During our meal, I was introduced to some of the fresh fruit beverage options that upon request were topped over ice cold certified organic Prairie Vodka. This is a must try!  For dessert, I had the flan. This is an El Dorado Cantina house recipe. It was the perfect finish to my meal.",

Food is always piping hot; tasty; authentic flavors; ingredients are fresh. There is a wide variety on the menu; there is a large selection of organic items; and the place is always open, as in 24 hours. It's great and we have been to this place repeatedly. We will return.   The one drawback is its location - while there is lots of parking, one of my relatives called its location \"smut alley\" due to its adjoining neighbor. I don't let that stop us from visiting this  for good food.  Servers attentive; food delicious; everything cooked and prepared there so the chef is on top of things....everything with appropriate ethnic spices yet you can choose extremely spicy, to moderate or mild as you prefer.",

We pulled up and was a.little taken aback because it's connected to a gentleman's club but we were so hungry decided to give it a try still. The interior was very sophisticated very nice. We started with a a pitcher of margaritas witch were $32 I thought it was a bit pricey but hey it's vacation. The margaritas were so good. You could taste the alcohol so it wasn't watered down and it wasn't over sweet because they use fresh lime and agave nectar. Made about 5-6 glasses. I ordered the carnitas burrito, my mom got the shrimp tacos, and my sister got the carnitas tacos. Everything was excellent! It all tasted so fresh and was such quality I was really impressed with everything. Loved it so much might have to make a trip back before the trip is over! Oh and they are open 24/7 so you can't beat that!",

As we got closer he laughed and informed us that it was located next to a Gentlemen's Club. No biggie! The margaritas were killer, the guacamole was flavorful and the cool part is that they make it right in front of you! I had the Chicken Enchiladas and my fiance had the Taco Dinner! Both were really good and I can see why they're rated high! The wait staff was also awesome! If you can make reservations. If you have to wait, you can always people watch cause it's Vegas!",

There were empty tables and booths and yet he was telling us there was 1 hour wait. He was willing to let us go instead of trying come up with a solution. I offered splitting our party into empty 2 booths, and even then he reluctantly accepted. The waitress Amber was friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. Recommended drinks and items. Ordered the chipotle cream chicken. The others in my party ordered the torta de milanesa, torta de carnitas and chipotle chicken. The food was surprisingly great, very tasty and authentic. Our meal concluded with Chef Paco delivering our deserts (I redeemed the Yelp offer for free flan ) which was yummy. With the exception of the manager overall  the place is great and opened 24/7 and good for kids despite being next door to Saphire strip club.",

    "text": "Pros: Locals deal on Mondays (used to be 50% off, not sure what it is now), great margaritas, great service, great food Cons: A bit pricey (unless you're the aforementioned local on a Monday), smells a bit like  cigarette smoke inside   I recommend: Margaritas (comes in a pitcher for potential sharing), shrimp taquitos (appetizer), shrimp cocktail, any street tacos, albondigas, cilantro garlic shrimp (or anything shrimp), FLAN (and possibly more things when I come back here)!  \"Are we next to a strip club?!\" said my mom. Yes mom, yes we are. But fret not for we are about to go on a mystical food adventure to El Dorado.  We arrived a bit before our reservation time and had to wait while they bussed some tables. No problem! It gave us some time to get our stomach prepared because when it comes to Mexican food, I don't play around. Anyhow, while perusing the menu, we chomped down on almost the entire bowl of chips. That habanero salsa is really, really spicy. Or I'm just a sissy when it comes to spicy things- dunno! Our waitress did warn us before she put the salsas down that it was spicy (thank you- me no likey surprise spicy).   As we were ordering, our waitress told us we were ordering A LOT of food. I can really appreciate it when you get told that because sometimes your eyes are more hungry than your stomach, you know? However, when someone tells me I'm ordering too much- it's challenge accepted. We picked a slew of appetizers and the one I loved the most was the shrimp taquitos because they have the perfect amount of crunch. My mom got a shrimp cocktail which she and my dad loved. She said the sauce is sweet and yummy and she kept the glass on the table after she was done eating all the shrimp so that she could dip the chips in the sauce, too.   For my entree, I got the cilantro garlic shrimp because I was in a shrimpy mood. And man, is El Dorado a good place to be when you're in a shrimpy mood. Their shrimp is definitely not the children's menu sized kind you find at other restaurants. For dessert, I got the flan. El Dorado's flan is blessed by the Flan Gods I think. It's just the perfect flan-tastic consistency.   Our waitress was Amber and she was really funny, sweet, and very attentive to all her tables. If she was busy, she would come by to tell you so, but would say she would be right back- and she would. When we come back, we're going to request to be in Amber's section because we're going to be BFFs one day.   Make sure you make a reservation if you're looking to go in for the locals deal on Monday! You don't want to look like some silly tourist when you get told there's no spots for you!",

    "text": "We really were excited to try El Dorado Cantina. We're pretty picky with what we eat so when we learned they serve sustainably sourced and organic items this was a huge plus. When our family came in from England to visit it seemed like the great time to give El Dorado a try and give the Brits their much craved Mexican kick.   Upon entering we actually bumped into a group of friends already seated and happily enjoying their margaritas (I'll get to the importance of this later)  Everything started well. We were seated quickly (at a high top table NEXT to our friends not WITH) and the standard chips and salsa were served.   Then it all went down hill. The food was nothing to write home about. It lacked flavor and maybe some extra care and attention. One meal was brought out wrong and had to be returned. A second meal seemed to be MIA along with a third that never even showed up and we had to ask twice what had happened. The second meal appeared and the third finally came once everyone else had finished. Not to be defeated and to give the benefit of the doubt we ordered churros... because why not... and they were actually delicious...Hence the 1 star.   Our bill finally arrived and we were a bit surprised at the amount. We were charged a large party service gratuity (because we happened to know the table seated NEXT to us not WITH us. - and FYI the other table did not have this on their bill) Our server then told us....\"We went ahead and took off the enchiladas (the 3rd meal) but it came off of your friends bill so they owe you a margarita\" ummmmmmmm that's not how it works. So now we got stuck paying an extra gratuity and paying for a meal that technically we should have been given for free???   For the price we paid and the experience we had we wouldn't recommend or return to this place. We'll stick to our other go to spots where we know we can still eat our organic, grass fed steaks or Mary's organic chicken for half the price and a much better personable experience.",

I would say we've visted at least 8 times over the past year bringing lots of our friends to try it out. Every time it's been a great experience and every time our friends love it too. One of our recent trips in October was because we saw the show \"Taco Trip\" which featured the Mahi Tacos. A friend was over at our house in Phoenix on a Saturday and watched the show with us. We were already planning a Vegas trip and I told her that we'd be hitting up this spot in a couple of weeks. She said, \"Why do we have to wait? Let's go now!\" So we all hopped in the car at 6 in the afternoon and were in Vegas by 10pm. We had lunch on Sunday before heading out of town and of course, we were not disappointed. See you guys soon as we'll be back in December!!",

My mom got a pitcher of margarita and it was a bad ass pitcher! We had a great time!!  THANK YOU ENRIQUE!!",

We arrive and its doorway is under the lights *SAPPHIRES GENTLEMANS CLUB* Worlds largest strip joint!!! Not quite the scene I was looking for with a four mth old baby in tow. Further inspection yields the revelation that ok, they share a roof with a seedy joint, but inside the cantina is an assortment of families eating like any given Sunday. The place is cavernous and we are invited to sit in the back where it's quieter.   Service was attentive and food came out pretty quickly. Pollo al pastor was decent, but if you've been to Mexico you won't be impressed. I haven't been to Mexico but the Mexican food in my imagination tastes better than this. I Also had chipotle chicken dish with onions, peppers, queso fresco and black beans . It was tasty but no chipotle detected. A Yelp checkin gifted us a flan which was basically baked condensed milk.   The menu states their farm to table, non gmo, organic gospel they're preaching outchea in the dessert, followed by a sober disclaimer that they can't guarantee they'll always have organic available. /side eyes",

    "text": "Just so you don't think I DON'T like ANYWHERE I eat, here comes a rave review!  Thankfully I G-Mapped my way here. When I pulled into the parking lot-which was predominantly taken by a \"Gentleman's Strip Club\", I was a little hesitant; wondering if I had made a mistake.  I almost turned around and left, but the rave reviews enticed  me to walk the gauntlet of buzzed men, leaving the club.  Damn am I so glad I did!  Ladies, stick it out, this is one restaurant so worth it! No, it's not a part of the club next door, even though their doors are very close to each other.  The ambiance is class A. But I never care as much about that as the FOOD. I personally prefer  food that is responsibly raised and organic. Please no extra hormones for me!  I have include a photo of the fact that this restaurant is hep to all that, and proud to show it.  I asked the bartender/waiter (I sat at the bar) what HIS favorite dish was and why.  \"Chipolte Creamy Chicken\", he responded.  After telling me about it I was sold.   Before the meal. the chip basket and three salsas were fantastic. I am soon very picky about chips, and do not like 80% of restaurant  chips. These were great. Salsas were too.  Main meal was dreamy. Veggies were even cooked to (slight al-dente) perfection. And while it had that smokey bite, it wasn't so hot I didn't enjoy it. Spice  level was perfect for me.  What stood out to me though were the beans! Yes, the beans that I usually don't even bother with. I tried a small bite, and MY GOD.... these were almost like my mom used to slow cook all day. But better.  I called him over and praised an item that most people don't even consider.  \"Oh, it's the lard, gotta use real lard\", he laughed.  I know this to be True, and boy does it make for flavorful and moist beans. Don't even think about lard-just enjoy.  I can't wait to go back to Vegas so I can stop at this hidden gem once again.",

Thin, fresh and properly salted.  We ordered table side guacamole. It was really good. A bit sour as lemon was extra but the spice and garlic was perfect.  The entrees we had ordered was disappointing. We had veggie enchiladas and cheese enchiladas. Those were not good at all. The red sauce was bitter and we were not able to eat it. The restaurant did change the sauce with the green sauce but this was very sour.  The street taco - corn rojas was bland. I had to add lot of salsa on it to make it tasty. My friends veggie burrito was perfect. We all loved that.  The rice that came with the dishes was awesome.  Jalapeno margarita was good.  Overall, pricey food and we have had better mexican in California.  A bit disappointing as we had more expectations from such a highly rated restaurant.",

I was told about it by a friend and then some of the people in my office mentioned it and I can't believe that I waited as long as I did (like 2 weeks) to try this place out.  It is AMAZING!  The fresh made guacamole at your table is fantastic and the street tacos are marinated to perfection.  I had the enchiladas and they were divine!  I really like the rice that they use because it is full of flavor and doesn't look burnt.  The black beans also had great flavor and we're very good!  All around, the experience was great and the service was friendly and quick.  Now, this place could be judged by the fact that it is literally next to a huge strip club, but I don't care because I will be back with my family members in the very near future.  I think this is one of my favorite spots in the Las Vegas valley!  You should stop reading this and just tell your navigation to go there!!  Update: This place is still absolutely amazing and the Chile Relleno is fantastic!    Update 2: My family from the Southeast came to visit us for the first time and we had to come to Eldorado Cantina!  They do not have very good Mexican food in the South, so they were blown away with Eldorado!  Thank you for staying consistent Chef Pablo!  Also, Stella was an amazing server!",

They add a variety of ingredients to the guac one of which happens to be serrano peppers that give it an extra kick. What really won me over is they ask you how spicy do you want it and after that it was a wrap for me. They had won me over.  We also ended up getting the imperial shrimp and cochinita. Both were amazing and we had lots of leftovers. Food was very affordable too and they're open late.",

First off when you walked in the place had a funky smell like a bad cleaning product. Not appetizing. I ordered the Shrimp burrito and first they gave me a beef one. I hate making a scene but I asked the waitress and she confirmed it was the wrong one. Then, I get the shrimp burrito and one half of it had 3 little shrimps with the rest rice and beans. The portion size is huge here so between the large amount of rice in my burrito and a large amount on the side they serve I had left over rice for days. On a positive note the waitress was super nice and professional.",

The chips were thin crispy and fresh- the green and red salsas were just ok- nothing memorable. I ordered a margarita it was undrinkable- I sucked up an entire mouthful of lime pulp- he took it back and remade it and it was acceptable- still pulpy but drinkable. the green chicken enchiladas with refried beans- as other reviewers have posted the chicken was chewy like it was deep fried- it was horrible. The beans were dry- not cheesy and gooey good. They supposedly gave you a free dessert when you checked in on yelp which I showed my waiter but when the bill came there was an 8.00 charge for the cake. He did adjust it off when I pointed it out. I would only come back if they get a new chef who knows how to cook.....",

To start off, the chips and salsa were great (some of the best chips I've had) and we loved all three options of salsa that were given with the chips.   We decided to order the Feast so we could get a little taste of everything.  While we loved the pork burrito, the steak burrito was also a huge hit. Whatever the steak is marinated in is perfect. We also took advantage of Yelp's check-in offer and tried a free carne asada taco that was excellent. Everything tasted very fresh.   For dessert, we tried the fried ice cream and the churros. The churros are filled with caramel- come on!! Delicious!  We would definitely recommended El Dorado Cantina and will be back on our next Vegas trip!",

We both ordered Margaritas....I got a mango frozen one which is my favorite type to order - it was ok - not as tasty and full of mango flavor as some others I'd had on this trip to Vegas, my husband enjoyed his rocks margarita for sure. Our server was very nice, although maybe had more tables than he could handle......sometimes it took quite a while for him to check up on us or give us the check, etc.......but we weren't in a hurry so no big deal. My husband ordered a burrito served \"wet\" style by recommendation from our server and he loved it. I had a salad with added chicken and it was just ok. We got a complimentary flan for checking into yelp which was the best flan I've ever tasted - I actually don't even normally like flan but this was super delish. The chef came out to greet us with the flan and was very nice, gave us his card and made sure we enjoyed our meal. Next time in Vegas we will try again - I'll order something else and maybe get the next review to 5 stars!",

And even gave me fresh squeezed strawberry juice to try and it was great! Chef Paco even stopped by to ask how everything was and to recommend dessert! I will definitely be back to see the friendly staff again. It was as authentic as it gets, reminded me of my grandmothers cooking who is straight from Mexico City. Cheese Enchiladas are one of my favorite dishes and I would definitely recommend theirs to everyone. Can't wait to go back again and try something else!! Oh and don't forget dessert!

The sauce they use is authentic and taste so good. The same can be said of the chips and salsa. The only drawback is you only get one round of chips and salsa, but it is so good it is worth the price for seconds. Restaurant is clean and you can't hear any noise from their neighbors. So glad we didn't pass this restaurant up.",

I wanted to try the ghost pepper salsa but because they charge YA $13.50 for it- couldn't justify it, as I'd be lucky to dip one chip in it... too hot to have a bowl of it!! My cheese enchiladas were great- my husband's chicken and beef fajitas looked to be as good as he said they were... we love mexican food and are regularly disappointed... NOT HERE! really, really great food!!",

The service was impeccable - I never had to ask for a thing and that's what I expect. The food was DELICIOUS and so were the drinks - I had the divorced eggs and some white sangria and the watermelon drink as well; husband had the street tacos and he finished those in record time and then started eating off my plate. Servers and the chef were constantly flitting about making sure we didn't run out of anything and that we were happy customers, which we definitely were. Prices are great too, I would absolutely come back my next time in Vegas!",

    "text": "First of all, it takes a LOT to impress my wife and i when it comes to \"Mexican\" cuisine. Several of our friends own and run world class Mexican restaurants in Aspen,CO as well as Los Angeles; However... we were BLOWN AWAY by El Dorado!!  When we first arrived at the address we thought we were lost as the address for the restaurant is identical with SAPHIRE MEN'S CLUB?.. Go figure. Well we realized the restaurant is hidden at the Saphire entrance, and so, here we where.  As we approached the front doors for El Dorado,  we where met with the warm smile of Arianna --- who turned out to be the restaurant GM.  Her warmth and sincerity were genuine as i commented to my wife - \"She loves her job\";  The food -- I had the Fajitas with shrimp and beef and it was exquisite.  The only place i ever had shrimp this fresh was in the Gulf of Mexico. The sauces where exactly what you would encounter at a world class restaurant in Mexico City, yet very home cooking style and unpretentious.The refried beans,  hot sauces (watch out for the HABENERO!!!) and garnishes all appropriate and  not your usual same old same.  My wife had the conchinita pibil and it was the best either of us ever had. Also, the drinks were like you would pore at home -- not some watered down tourist trap ripoff.  Two other mentions --  Chef Paco came over and introduced himself -- total class act.  He had us try the flan  -- the recipe has been in his family 80 years.  No BS -- ive had lots of flan in my time, but this was thick and creamy beyond compare.  And lastly, James -- bartender , took us around the bar and showed us some rare tequilas in display cases.  Our advice -- dont waste your time elsewhere -- the price is way worth it!",

When I found out it was next to the worlds largest strip club I had to do nothing but laugh, only in Vegas. But I decide to trust the yelpers! So glad we did. don't be afraid of the location the door to El Dorado is literally right next to the strip club door . it's a gorgeous restaurant inside and the food was great. Loved the street corn. And now for the steak fajitas! YumO! Let me say I have been to many many places over the years and the fajitas all sucked compared to Coyotes in Henderson on sunset. So when I tried them I expected to say ehhh not as good, but to my amazement they were delicious right up there and I will be back. I'll bring anyone I know to try it. We also had the carnitas tacos which were stuffed full of meat and delicious also. The rice a buttery cilantro rice was a nice change from the standard dry Mexican rice at most places. Our friend ordered the chicken enchiladas she said the green sauce was spicy and she loved it. Then the cherry on top was the flan we got for free for checking in on yelp. Very yummy and the chef himself brought it out to us and introduced himself. If you're a local try it on a Monday you'd be crazy not to! Make sure to get a reservation the place fills up pretty fast.",

The location is a little out there, and right next to a big strip club, but don't let that stop you. The service was a little slow, but I went back the next night and told the waiter I was in a hurry to catch a plane, and they served me almost immediately. Sean, the general manager was friendly and accomodating both nights as well. This place pretty much has everything, inlcuding fresh margaritas.",

We had a great night, aside from the doorman at the club saying, \"Hi, glen\" which I had to nervously shrug off.   You'll likely be amazed to see such a spacious and attractive spot (dimly lit, very dark red and black, very Dave Navarro's bedroom) next to a strip club, full of couples, groups, and families, packed even on a Monday night.  And no poles.  Service was very good at the bar.  The award-winning menu was creative but maybe too fancy for some folk (i.e. you won't find the #2 two hard shell tacos, refried beans and rice).  The two complimentary homemade salsas were too runny and smoky for the chips, but perfect for the food, especially on the yummy chorizo and egg burrito with thick homemade potato chips. Clean, strong, but pricey margaritas... mmm pineapple margarita.  Check-in on Yelp for a free lap dance.  Kidding, it's flan.  (I hope)",

So I'd say it's good considering its Vegas and my girlfriends didn't want to go all the way downtown for dinner. Hilarious that it's right next to a strip club; both uber drivers were cracking jokes at us the entire ride there and back.   Love the interior! Very very nice, a lot nicer than many other Mexican restaurants I've been to! We sat at this table with high chairs and got chips and salsa immediately. There were blue chips too which I looove.   We got to meet the chef, who gave us a lot of business cards and drink cards (with purchase of entree). Our waiter too urged us to write a yelp review for them so here I am doing so.   Free flan upon check in! I'm not a big flan of flan (lol woops), but I got it anyways. My girlfriends said it was good! I can't compare since I never really eat it.   I had beef taquitos ($15) which were cooked to a nice crisp. Unfortunately it didn't come with anything else, I wish I had ordered the tacos that came with rice and beans!   Service is great (a little pushy at times for that REVIEW), but I still had a good time.",

Felt a little strange/trashy coming to eat here, but was told their food was decent.  Ordered the fish tacos and the shrimp tacos and both were just OK. They didn't taste authentic at all and it was comparable to ordering tacos from Chili's or some chain restaurant. Our server was pretty much non existent our entire meal and we had to waive someone down any time we needed something.   The only good thing about this place is the habanero salsa and the fact that it's open 24/7. Other than that it's just meh. I'll be fine coming here with a  group of friends after a long night, but it wouldn't be at the top of my list. I just hate going to the strip for late night bites unless I'm already on the strip partying.   Yelp flagged the reviews of this place as potentially False, which I totally believe. The reviews are too good for such a mediocre place.",

The coffee was hot and tasty, the posole was delicious and the street taco plate was over flowing! The decor was really red but since it is next door to a gentlemans club I guess it fit.

We were seated quickly and our server was friendly and attentive as he kept our drinks filled. We were able to order promptly and the food was delivered rather fast (we were dining on an off hour, so this was somewhat expected as there were only a few other people in the restaurant). However, the food was way below average and actually kinda gross (with the exception of the table-side guac). The cilantro rice was a sticky blob of mush and smelt foul (it tasted worse than it smelt!). My burrito was lukewarm and my husband's carnitas burrito had so much liquid in it, we joked that maybe he had actually ordered soup. At the end, they did bring out a sombrero for my sister and presented her with a small portion of flan that was actually very good.  I should note that I live near a town that has a large Mexican population which means I have access to incredible authentic Mexican food, so maybe my expectations were a little skewed.  We were also somewhat surprised that they do not allow any substitutions. This is more for future patrons to be aware and was not included in my overall rating as I respect their policy. My sister wanted to order the chicken enchilada platter with one chicken and one cheese enchilada (willing to pay the full price for the chicken enchilada platter), but was told that she would have to order everything a la carte. I understand not giving a discount for the lesser item or not allowing her to add a more expensive item, but we've never encountered a situation where they wouldn't allow you to sub for a cheaper option. A la carte would've been way more expensive.",

Under new ownership, and prices jacked up!!!! Just had appetizer steak nachos to share ($19.50) and  pitcher of jalapeno margarita ($48)  total $77 and change with tax!!! I know this place is not cheap due to being all organic and gmo free. However, as a local and eating there regularly I've eaten entree's appetizers (for 2) and a pitcher of Jalapeno margarita for more or less the same price as today. Was charged $3 for extra 1oz scoop of pico and $2 for 1oz scoop of sour cream!!!!.. Jalapeno Margarita $40 and $8 side charge for Jalapeno!!!!!!! WTF!!!! I've been there Day evening week and weekends and it's busy, went today dead!!!! Loosing your customers due to your rip off prices!!! What a shame!!! Also pitcher margarita watered down too!!!! See what happens when you get greedy!!!",

She said she didn't even do anything wrong, he has such a bad temper.  Paco is so unprofessional and out of line to handle a back of the house situation like that. As someone who was in the restaurant industry for years, I knew to talk about issues at the end of a shift or on a day off, never in the middle.  I hope upper management steps in and reprimands Paco for his immature behavior. We will not be returning to the restaurant!",

Driving down the street there was several strip clubs, adult stores and seedy looking strip malls. When my GPS said I \"arrived\" all I could see was a big blue building that said \"Sapphires\" a strip club. Almost turning around I saw the restaurant and thought \"how good is the food if it's attached to a strip joint.\"  Well I was fooled, the food was excellent and the service was great. I had the Pazole and it was as good as the homemade pazole I've had.  The waiter was very helpful when we were ordering.

It took the waitress 20 plus minutes just to bring us our drinks (2 sodas and 2 bloody Mary's) the Bloody Mary tasted like pure tomato juice  When our food finally did come the food was overly salty and half our order was wrong. I asked for a side of sour cream and was charged $2! WTF?! This place is way over priced and too Americanized. Not authentic at all. It was a total waste of our time and money!",

However, the ambiance, food and service are really good.  My friend and I split a few things- the queso fundido with mushrooms, a steak quesadilla and emapadas.  Everything was killer.  I also like the red and green salsa you receive when seated.  I liked my margarita, however it was a little on the too sweet side.  Other than that, the vibe was great, the service was good and the food was on point.  The entire restaurant was full when we arrived and when we left, so local and tourists enjoy this place alike.

After a quick search, I noticed a free flan check in offer! (Yes!!!!) I was quickly on my way. FYI it shares a parking lot with a gentleman's club. Parking is free! I love that it's off the strip! The ambiance is great. And the food is even better. The salsas were tasty, empanadas superb, and my street tacos were divine. And the cilantro lime rice is shaped like a mesoamerican pyramid! Cute! The flan was heavenly. And after it was presented, the Exec Chef Paco checked in to see how dinner was. I loved that personal touch! I will be back for breakfast! I'm in love with this little gem.

We get there and we were like what the heck it's Sapphire gentlemen's club! Pretty funny but thank goodness it's separate from the club, just right next door. No glitter found in our tacos :)  Service was great! We sat at the bar and the guy serving us was so friendly and the chef came out to bring us our flan which was free for checking in. He gave us his card and asked us how everything was and said to enjoy his grandmas recipe. It was really creamy and delish, passed the husband test since he's a flan snob :)  We got the Siegal dinner send spicy chipotle tostadas (three big ones for 7.50 a steal) cilantro rice was yum! Also tried the tres leche in addition to flan.  White Sangria and Brazilian wax for drinks!  Thank goodness didn't order another meal b/c the portions are good, would not be able to eat anything else!  Will definitely be regulars.  Was just talking about how there wasn't any good Mexican restaurants in Vegas besides the fast food street taco places, but now I know! What a gem with nice people and good food with decent prices. Leaving full and happy!",

A bit intimidating, especially when we drove around in circles looking for it, then entered to find a loud wedding party in the restaurant, and waitresses in red satin bustiers and fishnets--very Vegas, but it had us wondering, Is this part of the club? No! DO NOT BE DISSUADED!! The hostess assured us a quiet(er) seat in the back room, and that the wedding party was leaving soon. :) After the dubious entrance, we ordered margaritas and focused on the extensive menu. There weren't many people there; other than the yelp reviews it seems that there isn't much advertising for this place, and the waiter told us it had only opened a few months ago... but is open 24/7-- how dangerous!!   Our waiter and all the staff gave excellent service throughout the evening. The maragaritas were poured at our table and were hands down some of the best I've had-- and I'm from SoCal so we know a bit about Mexican food... and drinks. The food was incredible, and I only hesitate a little when I say one of the best Mexican meals I've ever had. I had the street tacos (carnitas and chicken), and split a bowl of posole with my husband. I'm used to more watery posole; this had the richest and most flavorful broth I may have ever tasted. Each in my party of four people agreed that it was an exceptional meal. I know I'm bubbling over here, but after living on the East Coast for a long time, this place was literally an oasis in the desert. And the red velvet rose wallpaper is fabulous. Do not miss this restaurant. Or the flan.",

The chicken was so flavorful, I almost didn't notice the amazing corn pocket that it was tucked in. The chicken enchiladas were similarly amazing, with some of the best black beans I've ever had. The Al Pastor street tacos  here just the right balance of tender pork and sweet pineapple.   Overall this is a wonderful restaurant that I can't wait to visit again!",

It was bugging me that there were over 650 reviews and 4.5 starts but the place appeared that it was in the club.  Could it be True that the food is good in a strip club????

I came on a Monday because I heard about their local special.   We were sat almost immediately upon arrival which was nice.   But then our server came over. And he was weird. He seemed stoned. No joke.   They bring you chips and salsa almost right away which was nice. However, it's spicy salsa and their water glasses are essentially over sized shot glasses. I was with 3 other people and WE ALL were going through these glasses of water in less than 3 minutes a pop. I swear the poor bus boy had to fill our glasses 15 times.   We asked for a pitcher of water and the server brought over a pitcher that was the size of a regular glass. (I wish I was kidding).  If you own a MEXICAN restaurant and serve SPICY food then the water glasses should be NORMAL SIZE! I was so annoyed by this.   We got the steak quesadilla for an appetizer and that was very good.   But then after that... We waited over 45 minutes for our dinner. We were seated at 8:20 and didn't get our dinner until 9:25. On top of that? The food wasn't great. We each ordered different tacos (Chicken, Fish, and Carne Asada). And all three were  bland and boring.   The refried beans were gross. I LOVE refried beans and I couldn't even eat a second bite of these.   The only thing I didn't try were the drinks (they looked very good) and I might come back to try them but I won't be ordering any food. I'll be sitting at the bar.",

An order of 6 wings is $12.50. I know everything is organic so i expect to pay more. That being said this still seemed rather pricey. Being a big wing man i figured i would give them a shot anyway. I ordered 2 orders because six wings would not fill me up. Here is the really bad part. Most of the wings were the smallest i have ever seen. For over $2 a wing this was an absolute rip off. I ate about half of them and just decided to give up. So this is a warning. Do not order the wings!!",

Usually the food comes out quickly, however, on this particular morning it took quite a bit. One of the guys that came later and ordered after Us ended up Getting his food first. I gave the bartender a hard time about it thinking he must've forgotten the rest of our food order. Well, in all my years of working in hospitality and the service industry, I know how frustrating customers can be. Perhaps I was frustrating this morning, however, when the bartender told me to \"shut the f**k up\" (exact words he used) my desire to ever set foot in this restaurant disappeared. I was in shock. This caused a huge commotion among myself and my friend and we were asked to leave the establishment. As I left I happily gave him a piece of my mind. Hopefully no one ever experiences what I did.   Have to give another poor rating to this restaurant. First of all, after being told to shut the f*** up by the drunk bartender on duty there one morning, I have yet to hear a peep out of the managers of this restaurant. But whatever, not too shocked about that. However, this bartender continues to talk about that night and lying about the facts of what happened. He continuously talks bad about my friend and I to whoever he thinks will listen. I'm sorry, but I don't know what kind of business owners are okay with having a person like that- classless and rude- to be employed and represent their brand the way he does. Keep on coming with the rude comments about CUSTOMERS, who got cussed at and thrown out because we were upset about our delay on our order. I happily returned the insults To him on my way out the door. In any case, the longer he tries to smear my name and my friends, the longer I will continue w the Yelp reviews. Hope he gets drunk at work again tonight!. Good service can make up for bad food, but good food CANNOT make up for bad service.  Little update on this place",

Okay, I know allot of restaurants do this now, but this is very efficient and they don't interrupt you to tell you about the finer points of avocados, garlic and lime juice. They just make it quickly and set it down. Today our table had the Cedar Chipotle Salmon, and the Pineapple Shrimp. The flavors in these two jewels come at you from different angles to create a center of happiness. On my previous visit I had the Shrimp Tacos.Too many restaurants cook the shrimp until they are as hard as rubber balls. Finally someone can cook shrimp and leave the flavor and texture in place. Don't let the address on Industrial fool you. This Cantina could be in any premium Strip hotel.",

Prices were really reasonable anyway, with most dishes under $15 a plate. The guacamole was fresh and amazing. The chips were fine vessels to deliver the three kinds of delicious fresh salsa. All the dishes we had were amazing. My husband ordered the Carne asada, and said usually when he gets it other places it is only tender when it is hot but this stayed juicy throughout. My son had a burrito- he doesn't even like  Mexican food and said it was fantastic. The cilantro rice was yum. I had the street tacos- you can mix and match- so I had one chicken and two beef. All slow-roasted, each perfect.  The food was clean- not the over-piled plates of many Mexican restaurants that trade in quantity for quality. Portions were perfect-sized and we took home some leftovers. To top it off, our server Christopher was fast and courteous, really really excellent service, the kind that shows up exactly when you need it, not missing a beat. He was friendly without unnecessary check-ins and seemed legit happy. The chef brought out a piece of flan that we shared between the five of us- necessary because we all stuffed ourselves on dinner. It was the best flan I've ever had. Chef Paco said it was his mom's recipe, from Mexico City. All five of us large hungry adults ate for $75, feeling satisfied about a really great meal. I love this place. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "All I can say is wow.  The restaurant is in the same building as Sapphire with a separate entrance next to the Gentleman's Club.   It's very upscale with the typical entree running around $20 bucks or so.  The table side Guac is amazing.   The drinks are very pricey with a standard Margarita costing $11 and a pitcher costing $32 and you'd say those better be good Margaritas and trust me when I say they are.   All fresh ingredients and no sour mix and they don't use mystery Tequila.  The Street Taco section of the menu has a great selection and they're all terrific.    If you're a local then you know to go on Mondays.   Did I mention they're open 24/7. Only Vegas baby.",
