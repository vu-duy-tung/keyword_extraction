There were a lot of open tables so I wondered why the wait was so long. Sat there for ten minutes and the hostess sat two people that came in after us. We left.   I think we dodged a bullet",

I do find it odd that a breakfast restaurant in Las Vegas doesn't open until 7am. Nonetheless I got there at 7 expecting to see the normal breakfast options. I like a simple eggs and bacon. Then I noticed the burger section of the menu. I got a Mushroom Swiss burger. It tasted great! The cheese was smooth an not overpowering. The mushrooms were juicy and the bun was so soft and tasty! The fries were delicious and not greasy. I'm glad this place is so close to my house! I'll definitely be back!",

It came with a side of buttermilk pancakes which i subbed with the Cinnabun. My husband ordered the red velvet pancakes and asked for all the toppings on the side. Our pancakes came out first. The red velvet are always a no brainer, delicious. The cinnabun was ok. It came with a side of syrup with a drizzle of the cream cheese frosting but it is waaaayyy better with the cream cheese frosting than then syrup. They brought out my Portuguese sausage, eggs and rice last but as I looked down, some of the Portuguese sausage was raw. I brought it to the servers attention and she wasn't apologetic or sincere in any way. I sent it back and requested it to be cooked. Unfortunately after bringing out the raw sausage it threw off my appetite to eat there and didn't finish my food.  Also, as they serve Hawaiian style breakfast I would think they would serve Hawaiian Sun drinks or fruit punch which always goes hand in hand. No plans on coming back anytime soon",

We always order our favorites which are the banana fosters (short stack) pancakes and the adobo fried rice that comes with red velvet pancakes that comes with it. My husband and I always leave satisfied and of course stuffed! After eating at this place, our next meal will be dinner.   Unfortunately, they don't take reservations and it's a first come first serve basis and your entire party must be present in order to be seated.  The restaurant is clean and the staff is very friendly and make sure that you get refills on your drinks.   If you haven't been here, I HIGHLY recommend that you go.  They have other locations. It's better than any breakfast/brunch meal that you'll ever get at the strip.",

She has eaten at one of the other locations and was excited that they were finally opening one near our house.  We arrived in the early AM and were able to be seated right away.  When we left there was a wait list to get in - timing is everything!        We ordered the Banana Foster Pancakes, Loco Moco with Garlic Rice and Cinnabon Pancakes.  The Banana Foster Pancakes were delicious.  The sauce, bananas and whip cream made for an amazing combination.   The pancakes were light and fluffy and I was in foodie zen.  I got to try my daughters Cinnabon pancakes and to me they were better than an actual Cinnabon.  Light and fully and super delicious.  We shared the Loco Moco which was really good.  The Garlic rice which is an add on was delicious.       The inside is bright, roomy and well decorated.  The service was perfect and we were definitely well taken care of.  This was one place that really impressed me as I could never make delicious pancakes like they do.  If you love pancakes then you need to try Babystacks as they will satisfy your pancake craving with flair!",

    "text": "I've been to different Baby Stacks locations and this one is unfortunately the worst by far.  I gave this location 3 try's and now I say no more.  The first experience the service was scattered from the time we walked in.  The hostess was confused our group wanted to dine in since they were on a 15 min wait. Once seated we had to stop a waiter to take our order and the food came out slightly warm.  Shit happens and everyone paid without complaining just laughing at the strange breakfast.  My next go at this place started with better service until it was time to eat. My girlfriend and I both ordered eggs benedict. We noticed my eggs were basically hard boiled, the yolk was completely cooked to the point I separated from the whites, whole.  When I asked the waiter he looked and said, \"that's how they are supposed to be.\" I then pointed to my girlfriends plate and asked why her's looked runny and benedict like. We asked to speak to the manager but received the check when the waiter returned.   The hair that broke the egg... My last experience with this place came in the form of a to go order.  Figuring maybe the food would be better sans service.  The joke was on me... went for the omelette this time, figured it had to be a safe bet. At first glance the avocado, that of course was extra, was black. The first few bites of my avocadoless omelette were good. I had almost forgotten it didn't have the mean green avocado. Then it all went terribly wrong when I found hair imbedded in the middle of it all.  I'll let the photos tell the rest.    Good luck to those that venture into this pile of wasted eggs.",

Please, please have some more pride in this restaurant. Lately, it is falling apart -- especially dirty cups. Check your dishwasher please!! The food is great and location convenient,  I would really like to continue to go there... and I know the servers are busy (though it helps that they don't cash out their own checks), but it takes a second to make sure clean coffee mug / creamer bowl and creamer cups are clean, it take a second for the busser to double check the table cleanliness -- and a deep clean of walls and dusting is probably a good idea.

I ordered the cookies and cream pancakes, and I finished every last bit of those. They were delicious! We had good customer service, though we did have to wait to be noticed and seated. Other than that, great experience! I'd definitely go back to try more of their pancakes.",

The wait is usually quite a while since it's always so busy and there is always a long line. The breakfast choices are pretty average, nothing special, pretty similar to a few other breakfast places and kind of pricey. Babystacks are known for their pancakes, though! I've tried both the orange creamsicle and Nutella pancakes (both are amazing!) but the former was more favorable. I'll definitely be coming back, but the wait is really a pain, so be sure to bring something or someone to entertain you!",

They are owned by Hawaii people so they are always playing Hawaiian music which is so comforting if you're also from the islands ! Make sure to go there and you'll be hooked.

She then brings me the check and nothing was discounted (I'm not one to want a discount) but a simple 10% off or anything was kinda expected.

    "text": "Come here for the pancakes! My family and I come here often for their wide variety of pancakes.   Babystacks is a Breakfast/Brunch place that specializes in Hawaiian style dishes, such as the Loco Moco, Adobo Fried Rice, Kalua Pig Eggs Benedict, etc. However, they also have normal breakfast plates such as Eggs Benedict, Chicken Fried Steak, Biscuits & Gravy, etc. This place is pretty well known for their pancakes, especially their Red Velvet! They have a ton of choices to choose from that are pretty delicious and awesome.  Here are the dishes we have tried:  Kalua Pig Eggs Benedict - Not a fan. The Kalua Pig was burnt and didn't really go well with the Hollandaise Sauce.  Adobo Fried Rice - This was okay. There didn't seem to be a good amount of meat to rice ratio inside the omelette.   Eggs Benedict - Delicious! Eggs were poached perfectly, and their Hollandaise Sauce was spot on.  Chicken Fried Steak - My hubby's go-to dish! Good portion of chicken fried steak, delicious white gravy, and potatoes. Yum!   Loco Moco - This is a hit or miss. Sometimes the hamburger patty is good and moist, while other times (like today) it's dry and tough.   Red Velvet Pancakes - These pancakes are good, but our family prefers their other ones.  Lemon Ricotta - When I want something light and not as heavy and decadent as normal pancakes, I get these. They are really light, but definitely delicious.  Smores Pancakes - My son's favorite Pancakes! Chocolate chip pancakes, with chocolate drizzle, crushed graham crackers and marshmallows? So Good!  What I love about this place is the fact that I can get a normal meal, and then opt to get pancakes instead of toast/rice/potatoes for $1.50 more. Their pancakes are like a dessert for us, so it's nice to end our meals off with their pancakes instead of having to order a whole plate of them.  -1 Star for their inconsistent food/service at times.",

I'd definitely not recommend coming to vegas right now cuz it's 115 F right now and wow it's so hot I can barely touch anything in my car lol.  On to the restaurant, it's a nice size spot inside a new looking plaza (no shade parking though) sigh Everyone working there is really friendly and after the recommendations we decided to order french toast combo w sausage and eggs, country fried steak and eggs, add: red velvet pancakes ($1.50 extra), cranberry juice and chocolate milk. Everything tasted wonderful but the red velvet pancakes itself just taste like pancakes w red dye...it def lacks the red velvet cake flavor.  But if you combine the whip cream and white sugar syrup that comes w it, it sord of resembles that flavor.  The chocolate milk taste like milk w a hint of chocolate (I think).  Overall: pretty decent breakfast place considering the location :)  might return again if I ever come visit my friend this way and craving for breakfast.",

If you are looking for a great place to eat for brunch then be sure to come here. The services, the atmosphere & food is worth it!   My favorite is the Kula eggs benedict. It is to die for, you have to try it. Make sure you order some red velvet pancakes OMG you'll thank me later! Other favorite dishes are the Adobo Omelet, Loco Moco and Lola Coras Corned beef hash.  Every time I have family visiting, we always eat at Babtystacks cafe and they always want to go back!",

Our food came out soon after, we were shocked how fast it came. We were starving so we were incredibly happy. My son scarfed down his food, but he said \"now that was good\". Spinach Benedict YUMMMM.

The red velvet pancakes tasted just like cake with a delicious cream cheese syrup on top. The bananas foster pancakes were sweet and tasty! Our server was friendly and quick.

We ordered 2 \"Build Your Own\" omelettes that were both served with your choice of short stack pancakes. You select from a choice of meat, cheese and toppings; I had turkey bacon, spinach, tomatoes, pico de Gallo, and swiss cheese served on top of roasted potatoes on a skillet- absolutely delicious! We ordered the red velvet and hazelnut as our choices of pancakes- both of which were perfectly fluffy and delightful! The red velvet is their most popular pancake and is served with a side of frosting that I wish I could bathe in tbh- if that doesn't speak volumes Idk what does!   We arrived around 9:30ish and service was actually pretty quick for a Saturday morning. I'm pretty sure we beat the crowd considering we were seated immediately but by the time we left they had a 30 minute wait.   Definitely enjoyed my experience and will be back!",

It's a newer facility so it feels cleaner, it seems larger and the service is AWESOME!  Our server, wish I could remember his name, seems to be the Babystack Ambassador. His recommendations were on point. My husband ordered the chili moco. However, the Ambassador had advised my husband to get it with the side of Portuguese sausage so that my husband could have it with both the sausage and the hamburger patty. My husband was floored to see that the Portuguese sausage sliced and surrounding his plate, but also had sausages between the rice and hamburger patty! What!? And the chili was really good.  My husband did order a side of the bacon pancake which he wasn't too impressed with.  I ordered the ever famous Chicken Adobo Fried Rice Omelette and got a side of the lemon ricotta based on the Ambassador's recommendation. He said it would be lighter since it was a crepe and since our breakfast was more on the heavy side. DAAYUM that lemon ricotta was super ono!  To Lolo Rick or Lola Cora, could you consider adding shrimp sarciado to your menu, please? It is my favorite back home in HI and I haven't been able to find a Filipino restaurant in Vegas that makes it. That dish is a hit in HI and I'm sure it will be a hit in Vegas as well.",

The fried rice is huge and I always have leftovers for dinner later in the day. As for their Red Velvet Pancakes, they are so heavenly. I'm not a big fan of pancakes at all but I love theirs! It's cooked to the perfect texture with a slight crispiness on the edges. Paired with the cream cheese frosting that you drizzle all over it, along with some cocoa powder on top. It's a must try for sure.   I'll continue to come back, they have pretty good customer service too!",

The server was ok, the host was just absolutely clueless to what and how to do his job. Answered the phone with \"hello\" not with the business name, sat people way out of order and was just rude. We waited 30 minutes for a table when others came in and got sat in 5. I actually said something and ended up getting the next table.   Our order was a little off but the gentleman that brought it out right was the absolute nicest of the group of people we interacted with. Very small dining area left us feeling super cramped. People would walk by and run into our chairs and table.   I believe this was all started off with the host guy and his lack of personality and experience in his job.

After visiting multiple times and trying various omelettes, pancakes, and sides, I can say without a doubt that this is my go-to breakfast spot in Vegas.  As far as pancakes go, I absolutely *love* the banana fosters for a sweet but not overly sweet stack of pancakes. The red velvet is great if you've got a real sweet tooth. The strawberry pancakes and blueberry pancakes are great for a more simple but still tasty option. As for omelettes, I prefer to build my own. The Huntington and Mexican are the two set omelettes that I've enjoyed the most. I also can't say enough about the biscuits and gravy-- yum.",

Because it was the first meal I ate of the day and after that I was sick with fever, chills, and constant running to the bathroom for two days. I ordered Kalbi & eggs, which was good, however it gave me food poisoning. I had a side of buttermilk pancakes, which was surprisingly not good being that's what they're known for; the pancakes were really dry. My friend who ordered the works, didn't like her hash browns and felt her sausage was under cooked she mentioned she didn't like her meal to the waitress, however the waitress just said, well here's your bill.... We asked for separate checks, they said the couldn't make separate bills and that we would half to pay half & half, which was inconvenient because our meal wasn't half and half in price. When we mentioned it to the cashier, a rude boy got smart and said, there's a sign on the door stating we don't split bills or whatever. Like who walks into an establishment and reads multiple signs on the door? I came in to eat not read. Horrible experience!!!!",

    "text": "So stoked to finally check out Babystacks. I've been waiting for this one to open by my house for like forever. I've been hearing so many good things and they didn't disappoint. I came here on a Saturday for breakfast with my friend Julian and it was packed! We took a seat outside and waiting maybe 15 minutes before we were called in for our table. We sat in a little two seat table by the wall and checked out the menu. I'm a queen of consistency when it comes breakfast. I always order either the chicken fried steak or huevos rancheros for breakfast. Sometime I'll thrown some pancakes in but usually the prior. However, when I came to Babystacks I ordered something completely different. I decided to go with the Mexican Skillet and we split the s'mores pancakes. The Mexican skillet comes with carnitas, jalapenos, pico de gallo, pepper jack cheese, and sour cream. I also ordered a side of avocado. It was so tasty. The skillet was a great mix of meat and cheese and yum. Only thing I might request next time is less sour cream and maybe some green salsa. I love green salsa. The s'mores pancakes were so sweet, but that is to be expected. They of course come with chocolate chips, marshmallows, whipped cream, and graham crackers crumbs. They barely needed any syrup. I think I ate too much and had a food coma. I went straight home and took a nap. I'm excited to go back and try my normal stuff plus more.",

However this was my first experience at this Babystacks Cafe and by far it didn't hold up to the other Babystacks location standards.  We were greeted by the host and our server Danny was nice. Today we got the white chocolate macadamia pancakes, side order of garlic rice, and a loco moco.  I was disappointed when I found hair in my garlic rice and immediately took it back.  It was a bummer.  The loco moco was okay except for the patty.  The patty was hard as a rock but the flavors were there. I'm very disappointed with today's experience hopefully when we come back next time it will be better.",

First of all, we were patient to wait almost an hour after the person at the front desk said the wait was about 25 minutes. Then I notice people were getting seated before us after they were on the wait list after us??? We finally get seated and then the server took awhile to take our order. We had to wave to somebody that we were ready. The server still took time. Finally, after 30 minutes, I notice people that came after us got their food before us. WTF!!!! Horrible service!!! You don't treat your customers that way. It was like we were invisible at the restaurant.",

The pancakes were good but they only gave me two and the menu states the order should come with three *eye roll*. The adobo omelette is comparable to the one from Aloha Kitchen but tastes a little more like soy sauce and is smaller than size. Didn't care for the hashbrowns, they weren't cooked enough.  Edit: Just got home and we opened our boxes of omelettes. One of our three orders is missing a side. The girl never asked what side I wanted over the phone. So they gave us one with hashbrowns, one with potatoes, and one completely side-less. WHY?! Ripped off by one less pancake and one less side. *eye roll again* now I'm changing this rating from a 3-star to 2.  Overall, food was ok.",

But now that it's so close to my house, I can get the awesome red velvet pancakes / and adobo fried rice whenever I want. So I guess the bad service is a small price to pay to get those foods.

    "text": "After coming to this location frequently after it first opened a couple years ago (fact check is required because I can't remember off the top of my head when they opened), I figured it was time to finally leave my review.   This location is easily accessible off Blue Diamond and Cimarron. Parking can be slim pickings depending on when you go since it's shared with nearby stores, and since Babystacks is normally pretty packed all the time.  Just like all their other locations, besides their specialty pancakes and their Hawaiian/Filipino-inspired dishes listed on their menu, they also have off-menu offerings which are constantly changing depending on the seasons and holidays. One thing that I have noticed they've done a little differently with their food is that their omelettes are LOADED with cheese on top. As much as I love cheese, sometimes it's a little too much, in my opinion. Different strokes, different folk.   Also similar to their sister locations (with the exception of the northwest location on Durango), the space is a little small & seating is pretty limited, so expect to wait a little bit to be seated (again, depending on when you go).  Overall, Babystacks remains to be my favorite go-to spot for brunch and red velvet pancakes.",

Everything on the menu looked really good, so it was hard to decide. Ultimately, I settled on the Lolo Rick's Adobo Fried Rice with extra garlic and hash browns on the side. The garlic fried rice was made with shredded chicken in a tasty marinade. I was half expecting the chicken to be dry, but it was good and seasoned well. The rice was wrapped in an egg omelette. Our waiter was a little confused when I asked for extra garlic in the rice. It wasn't a difficult request but he had a hard time understanding me. My boyfriend got the Breakfast Burrito, which was really amazing. It had peppers, onions, cheddar cheese, your choice of meat, and red or green sauce. This also came with hash browns on the side.   Sadly we had dinner reservations or I would have tried some of their pancakes. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in down!",

I would recommend you go there not in a rush and wear stretchy pants... Because you will not leave there hungry!  This is an amazing pancake House with a Hawaiian twist. Every time I go there I think I know what I want to order...then I see somebody else's food and change my mind. Everytime I branch out of my comfort zone and get something new I'm never disappointed.  The seating is small and somewhat cramped but the staff does a tremendous job of making sure all the tables are bussed and filled very fast. Our waitress is always such a sweetheart and gives us our drinks to go at the end. It is such a nice touch to have such great customer service!  Now for the food! Where do I begin? My husband's favorite is the adobo rice omelette... But he loves their skillets too. I have too many favorites to choose from including the Portuguese sausage, spam & garlic sticky rice, all their Eggs Benedicts, Mac salad, and of course their Loco Moco!   The interior is painted cheerfully bright with different colors and upbeat Hawaiian and reggae music keep the customers happy. I would definitely say the vibe here is completely Island-friendly and super chill.  As for the pancakes... My 6 year old is a complete pancake foodie and claims their red velvet are the best in town. She always picks this place for breakfast and I can see why because they treat her like a princess and give her the hook up with the extra whipped cream. My husband loves the German chocolate pancakes but claims he will have a heart attack if he eats them more than once a year. All the pancakes are incredibly decadent and today, when we went I watched a woman steal her husband's Banana Foster pancakes and ate half of them before he even noticed lol.  I highly recommend you come here and take your time it's worth the wait. Give the menu items you've never tried a chance because your mind will be blown!",

So they are known for their pancakes, which I've tried the first time I came. I had the white chocolate macadamia nut pancakes and the Kalua pig benedict. The kalua pig is very savory a little salty but still amazing! I had to split the pancakes because they are very rich but so heavenly. I've also had the regular buttermilk pancakes and even those are pretty tasty! The most recent time I went (on Easter), I had the Portuguese sausage with garlic fried rice and eggs. I would say the Portuguese sausage helped make this dish because it was so delicious but it was a tiny bit greasy. The eggs were fine, not astounding, but the garlic friend rice disappointed me. I barely tasted any garlic and had to add some salt and pepper to help season it. Overall, definitely come here and try the pancakes for sure (I missed the special green tea one that had that day!!!). The staff was very friendly and food came out very quick!

This place is around the corner of my house, no I'm not coming back!  This place should invest in dinner plates,  so people dont struggle cutting their food...",

We ordered the Lolo Rick's Adobo Fried Rice which came with Red velvet short stack pancakes with fresh whip cream, chocolate crumbles and cream cheese syrup. We were able to substitute egg whites only on the omelet for an additional $1.25. We also tried the White Chocolate Chip Macadamia Nut short stack. The short stack comes with some Macadamia crumbs on the side, topped with extra white chocolate chips and warm maple syrup.   The pancakes were very fluffy and filling. The Adobo fried rice was delicious! Shredded chicken with rice wrapped in an egg omelet. Sure there was a hint of soy sauce in this omelet. Delicious goodness that seem to disappear before our eyes 8-D  Will be back again to try some of the other short stack flavors.",

Why are you making small talk with 7 people waiting to leave! Do you not see the fire hazard you are causing?   I won't come here when it's busy.

The staff was very friendly and most of the food was amazing as usual. I ordered steak and eggs and asked for a medium steak. When my order came out the steak was definitely not medium but I tried a few pieces anyways to see if I could eat it but it was tough and well done so I asked the server to take it back. He came back and said the middle of the steak had pink in it but he could make me another. So I decided to take it back and try it. The server was right there was SOME pink in the middle but the entire steak was over cooked. I didn't want to wait again for another platter to be ordered so I just decided not to eat it. When I asked for the item to be taken off the bill bc it wasn't eaten he said no because he offered to make me another one. I work in customer service and I was so disappointed how the situation was handled. I wasn't trying to be difficult but if I legitimately wasn't happy for the item and didn't even touch it I shouldn't have had to pay for it. I'm definitely not anticipating eating at this restaurant again any time soon.",

Most recently I just got classic chocolate chip and they were great as well. I've also had their skillets which are also amazing. I personally like them better than the ones from egg works. This place gets crowded but it's definitely worth the wait. The staff is very friendly and they have great prices! Would definitely chose this place over egg works any day! Mist",

I looked up Babystacks Cafe online since it's close by us in Mountain's Edge and we were enticed by the variety of delectable breakfast fare on the online menu. They have so many delicious pancakes available. We ordered banana cream pie pancakes, steak and eggs, and two egg breakfast. We would recommend placing names on the to-go orders, my husband called from the restaurant to see what we ordered. It was nice to be able to substitute rice for potatoes, and the entrees include buttermilk pancakes. We were highly satisfied with our meals and will definitely order take out breakfast again or eat in at Babystacks Cafe.",

Quickly seated and was asked for our drinks immediately. Our sever was very sweet, service was quick, food came out quickly and was delicious.  I ordered the Kalua Benedict, this was very tasty. They put a lot of meat on the Benedict and a lot of sauce. This was delicious but is very heavy.. Do not order this if you do not want a big and heavy breakfast. My brother got the huevos rancheros and said the portion at this location is smaller than at the other location but that it was still very tasty. Both the green and red salsas were very good.. Not too salty and not too sour. We also orders a short stack of the pancakes and turkey bacon. Overall very satisfying meal, will come back for sure.",

If you're from the islands like me, you'll be happy to find portuguese sausage and rice on the roster served with aloha here.  The place isn't that huge, but it does get crowded especially on weekends, so expect a wait unless you're there the minute they open. Decor and layout are simple and laid back, but the eats are definitely the star.",

The server (Edgar) had no personality and was not friendly at all. He was basically a order taker. Dropped off our plates and walked away. He didn't ask if we needed anything else and he never checked back to see if our food was ok. We also had to ask for our check, which we had to wait for. I will not return and I will spread the word about the terrible service to all my colleagues in the industry.",

My other favorites are the red velvet pancakes, cookie butter French toast, and garlic rice. Will be back again to try the hazel nut pancakes and the adobo fried rice dish.",

    "text": "Extremely disappointed. My boyfriend and I used to love going to the first location in town we were so excited that they opened a southwest location by our house. I ordered banana foster pancakes with no sauce or Carmel just wanted bananas and whip cream pretty easy right? Wrong. They brought them out and they were drenched in Carmel the pancakes were swimming in a sea of Carmel, very smiley soggy, so I politely asked for them to remake them like I asked in the first place the serve argued but then finally re made them. They were brought out a second time almost the same but this time the pancakes were swimming in a sea of butter. I politely stated this still isn't what I ordered and stated I have order them before at the other location and at this location once before and the server argued with me stating I was in the wrong so I just said never mind can I just get normal pancakes. The normal pancakes finally came out fine. The couple next to us even stated that that was ridiculous they even knew what I wanted. Pancakes topped with bananas and whip cream. When the check was presented nothing was discounted she charged us for extra items then when we asked to see a manger she said she was the manager and kept telling us we were in the wrong and she had a very hostile attitude  I don't appreciate being treated that way no costumer should. Horrible costumer service. I will not be back to this location.",

The food wasn't terrible just not all that great.  Me & the fam just stuck to the basics.  I ordered two eggs over medium w/ turkey sausage patties & seasoned potatoes, my husband ordered the mexican burrito & my son had the kid's meal: one egg, one turkey bacon that was burnt to a crisp, seasoned potatoes & juice.  Our entrees came w/ buttermilk pancakes as well, that were too dry & overcooked.  Our server was really good but I wasn't really impressed w/ the place cause 1) Food was bland, I could make better at home 2) Iced tea was super diluted, tasted like water 3) Seating is too crammed 4) Noise level is loud & so annoying 5) The two cashiers at check out were not very efficient, they seemed rather disorganized & confused.   That said, we probably won't be back anytime soon.  Bum deal cause we live so close.",

Once finally greeted we then waited another 10 min while they bussed several tables that had been empty since we had walked in. Upon being sat we were only given 2 menus for 4 people. Drinks were ordered and only 1 of the correct drinks was delivered. We looked over the menu decided on our meals and waited to order. After ordering and asking again for coloring pages for the kids we waited. One persons food came out at a time. Except one order. The server about 15min after everyone elses food was delivered approached the table and asked do you guys need anything else. I responded with ya my food would be great. It took another 10 min as Im assuming the server for got to put it in. The order was bacon and eggs and potatos. Nothing fancy or complicated. The server seemed more put out by the fact that I was asking for my food then anything. By the time it arrived everyone at the table was finished eating. So I ate a few bites quickly and didnt finish as it was not how I ordered my eggs cooked  (I am pregnant so I cant eat under cooked eggs)and I got hashbrowns instead of the potatos I ordered. We asked for the check and again waited. At this point there was only 2 other tables in the restaurant besides us. The server avoided the table after dropping the check as nothing was remedied about my food being forgotten. We then waited to pay standing at the counter for another 10min. A seemingly quick lunch turned into almost 2 hours unfortunately.",

However the food is still at the top quality.   There is a large variety of menu options. I always have a hard time choosing what I want to eat, because I always crave anything from them. If you're looking to eat something sweet and savory, I would go with ordering a plate on the back (ex: Spam & eggs) that plate already comes with hashbrowns/potatoes AND a side of buttermilk pancakes (which you can upgrade!!)   I always go with the Spam & Eggs, with hashbrowns & Red velvet pancakes.  The adobo fried rice is super yummy as well (however it is more on the salty side, so it's better to have if youre sharing).   White chocolate macadamia pancakes & banana foster pancakes are 11/10. Love how they are not too sweet.   The service is normally spectacular, but people have their days. There are normally long waits as well- since it is where locals go most of the time. Yet, That still won't stop me from coming since the food is so great!",

It's not very big, and considering how popular it is that seems pretty standard. Service was good. Our drinks never went empty.   I ordered the Spam Scramble and upgraded to garlic rice and a side of brown gravy. Glad I did because the garlic rice is bomb. I prefer my spam a little more done that what they served, but if I go back I'll be sure to ask if they can cook it longer. I loved that you could upgrade to a small stack of pancakes because I was so torn between the S'mores pancakes and the Spam Scramble to begin with. Pancakes are definitely their jam here. Fluffy and not drowned in whipped cream. Just the right amount.   Perfect meal for a food coma on the ride home back to California.",

Their food here is comfort food and I love how it reminds me of home.   I have tried their adobo fried rice, Portuguese  sausage/spam breakfast and almost all their pancakes. You're able to upgrade your pancakes to their speciality pancakes and I love getting their red Velvet pancakes.    I'm not the biggest fan of whip cream, but theirs taste homemade and it's just the right amount of sweet to have with the red velvet pancakes.",

    "text": "I won't ever place a To-Go order with this location again. They said the order would take about 10-15 minutes. It was a Sunday morning - I knew they would be busy - so I took my time. I got there in 20 minutes. The cashier had a few To-Go orders around her - a couple on the counter, and one on a stool behind her. After waiting in line, I finally got to the cashier. I told her my name and she did a quick glance at the current orders she had and said it's not ready yet. I found that a little odd since I was already a few minutes \"late\". So I stepped aside and waited. After waiting over 10 minutes, all of the To Go orders had been picked up (except that unlabeled To Go order sitting on the stool behind her). I started growing weary that she had overlooked that order and didn't realize that was my order. Another To Go order got dropped off at the counter and she finally called me back over. I assumed that latest order was mine, but instead,  she grabbed the To Go order that had been sitting on the stool (since I had first arrived!!!) and presented it to me. I stared and asked if that had been sitting there the whole time. She tried to explain the server had only just dropped it off right before the other order. Lies. I had literally been standing there this whole time.  Angry, frustrated, and already exhausted, I just paid and resolved myself to knowing I was taking home food that had been sitting out for 20+ minutes (due to just a simple mistake that someone didn't want to take ownership of). It should be noted that the order sitting on the stool had no label on it, which could have prevented this.  Overall, this place has amazing food, but this To Go experience has left a cold taste in my mouth (literally). Even my dine-in experiences aren't \"amazing\". You often have to wait a long time for a table (I get it - it's a tiny venue and a popular place), but once seated, I've often waited a long time for my food to arrive. There's a lot of other local breakfast places in town I'll be visiting instead. At least for a while.",

    "text": "Loved the pancakes and coffee. Excited that the pancakes actually weren't as overly sweet as they appeared to be. The sweetness was subtle and not sickening at all. We'll definitely be back again even if we're not getting pancakes.  We were there 1st thing in the morning, so we didn't have too many issues with the wait other reviewers mentioned. There were 3 other tables seated in the restaurant when we arrived.    It did take almost 10 minutes to get our coffee, which is a serious crime to me for any breakfast spot. But they were on top of the refills to make up for it, which was very much appreciated. Also, I noticed while we were there that they had a LARGE number of takeouts popping in and out, so i can definitely see how wait times for food can quickly get ridiculous if the restaurant gets full.  Basically, this will be our go-to for breakfast as long as we're ready to go first thing in the morning.",

    "text": "Super delicious pancakes! My friends and I each ordered a different pancake so we could try out the different ones. My top pick is the macadamia nut white chocolate pancake, followed closely for a tie with the red velvet and bananas foster. I personally did not like the German chocolate pancake. It was WAYYYY too sweet for my taste buds but this is just my personal taste.  I ordered the adobo fried rice which is served as an omelette. It's HUGE!!!! I split it with one of my friends and she ordered the Kahlua pork benedict which she split with me. These were both super fabulous!!!  The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 star is because the location that I went to on Blue Diamond had a broken A/C. It wasn't super hot inside but it was still a bit uncomfortable. I hope they get their a/c fixed soon.  I do live closer to the one Stephanie so I'll give that place a try with my husband.  Sure hell love the Kahlua pork benedict!",

It was my first time trying loco moco and it was fantastic! We also ordered the adobo fried rice, red velvet pancakes, and Nutella crepes with strawberry & banana--all super delicious! I was shocked with how affordable it was for all that food!  The only complaint I have is that they don't give enough of the cream cheese syrup/sauce to go with the red velvet pancakes. I ordered the half stack which came with 3 huge pancakes, and I probably used the whole little cup of syrup for 1.5 pancakes. It tasted so bland without the syrup. It was too late for me to go back to ask for more. I think they charge you for more syrup though.",

Portions are large and I made the mistake of ordering a FULL stack of pancakes my first time here. A half already has 3 and is more than enough especially if you're eating other stuff like breakfast skillets, which are bomb by the way. Their pancakes are so good and there's so many to choose from! Very fluffy and sweet; definitely satisfied my sweet tooth and kept me full for most of the day.   They have savory entrees as well, such as Adobo Fried Rice, Kailua Pig Benedict, Loco Mocos, Skillets, County Fried Steak and Burritos. Feels like I'm in Hawaii or the Philippines.

The serving is not as generous as eggworks and they are a bit pricey but I would pick this place over any breakfast restaurant in the valley! They also give military discount which is a plus!

I had never been here before but everyone else had.... I was very impressed with my pancakes! I got the PB and ?... I choose bananas then added Nutella it was sooo good!  I have a picture of my nephews rocky road ones which where also delicious! I got two different omelettes ( shared with my boyfriend) and they where both good.  Let's just say there was ten of us and we all enjoyed our food a lot! And the price for everyone's food and drinks was about $140 which is really good for a family of ten I think.

The pancakes are varied with more options than any other comparable restaurant I've been to.  Somehow they are able to get their pancakes crispy, light, and fluffy without any greasiness. Their Hawaiian inspired dishes are great and the standard American style breakfasts are well prepared.  Try their red velvet pancakes and the Loco Moco substituting Kalua pork and garlic rice.

    "text": "Filipino fusion... sounds like me! I have always considered myself a Filipina Fusion so Babystacks Cafe seems to really understand me.   Okay, so yes I look the part of being a Pinay but I did not grow up eating a typical Filipino breakfast of Spam, garlic fried rice and an over-easy egg. I am actually an egg white girl with turkey or chicken sausage and whole wheat toast or English muffin type of Pinay. There are times when I enjoy French Toast or a fun stack of pancakes (got that from my white washed Pinoy pops) and a side of turkey sausage or regular bacon. Okay... okay... I know.   So I say that Babystacks seems to understand me because I can fuse and eat that traditional Filipino breakfast and mix and match with a bit of what I grew up eating. So like this... I can order Spam/ Portugese sausage with garlic fried rice. I can add my egg whites instead of regular eggs. I can also add a fun stack of pancakes (thank you white washed Pinoy Pops) in the mix, like the carrot cake pancakes with cream cheese frosting syrup. YUM!!   This location is close to where I live and I do love a good breakfast place that I can eat with family and friends, so the convenience is perfect. The servers and hostesses who work here are great! All have been very accommodating and friendly.    Babystacks Cafe has been a fantastic place for me to do some personal and food fusion!!",

I've been to the OG location a few times and liked it. We were looking for a place to eat on  Blue Diamond and so here we are.  Got the famous omelet with chicken adobo fried rice and choose the pancakes as our side. In fact, we upgraded to the white chocolate macadamia pancakes.  The omelet: Huuuge portion. Taste of the fried rice w/chicken adobo was good. I would recommend ordering eggs over easy and enjoy the wonderful yolkiness.  The pancake: Waited over 10 minutes for these babies to arrive after the omelet was delivered. Well when it arrived, it wasn't cooked thru and really wasn't worth the upgrade.  Coffee was good and bottomless. Besides the pancake snafu, service was friendly and attentive. Mgr did take 20% off our bill with apologies.",

    "text": "My favorite breakfast joint!! I've been here several times and will constantly crave Babystacks when I'm away for school. Everything is very flavorful and made with fresh ingredients. The fusion take on the dishes is what makes this place unique.   The Loco Moco is made with the best gravy in the world. I would literally drink a gallon of it (it's THAT good). It's a Hawaiian classic that hits just the right spot to keep you full and happy. I tried it with regular rice but I imagine the garlic rice would take it to the next level.   The Veggie Garden Omelette was a healthy choice to counteract my side of Tiramisu pancakes. The omelette was satisfying, but the pancakes were the showstopper. They're one of the limited edition pancake flavors that are found on the chalkboard. I wish this flavor was year-round because it's the perfect combination of coffee-flavored pancakes and creamy whipped cream. I never wanted it to end.   The Spinach Benedict is a solid breakfast. The yolks were inconsistent (one was runny while the other was mostly solid) but the flavor was delicious. I loved the crispy seasoned potatoes and toasted English muffin.   If your dish has the option to upgrade the side to your favorite babystack, you should do it. Even if it may seem like a lot of food, take the pancakes to go and you'll thank yourself later.",

I came here mainly at the suggestion of fluffy pancakes by friends who frequent it. I like that they have Hawaiian & traditional American breakfast items.  I went with the spam scramble and a babystack of chocolate chip pancakes. The spam scramble was ok. It came with a scoop of furikake rice and a decent amount of cubed spam and scrambled eggs. I prefer my spam a little more toasty but other than that, this dish is not bad.   The pancakes... Oh so good. Im glad I picked the chocolate chip. It was a great topping along with the whipped cream & powdered sugar. The pancakes were soft and fluffy. I really enjoyed them. It came with a chocolate sauce but I didnt even use it. The pancakes didnt need them. They were tasty as is. The portion was also just right.   Service was good. We had 3 different people asking us for our drink orders after someone already took it. Ha!.. Babystacks is busy. Pay up at the register when you get your bill. They close by mid-afternoon. FYI.",

We were accommodated in less than 15 minutes, stroller and all. I had the adobo ride and chicken omelette, my husband had the cowboy omelette, and we split a stack of carrot cake pancakes. Everything tasted good and the service was great despite the restaurant being pretty full. Overall this was a good place to have breakfast and we'd love to return on our next trip to Las Vegas.",

First, a party of two has to wait to be seated after every party of 4 or 6 because the host doesn't want them to wait too long if she gives up too many 2 seats, they wait to push tables together to accommodate the parties that come after. So a wait time for a party of 2 is ridiculous when it should be vice versa. They messed up the order and was short with us when we asked to fix it. So sad, but when they always have a line no one will do anything about it.",

We've had this same exact order at two other locations and there was no hiccup in quality despite it being their Grand Opening. In fact everything was up to the high quality standards I've come to expect from BabyStacks. The food was delicious and cooked perfectly.   Service:  Was great and everything ran smoothly. Drinks never empty. I appreciate that we didn't have to wait long. 5-10 min till we were seated, which is great compared to some other wait times experienced at other locations.",

However, this time our garlic rice was more like onion rice. They roughly diced huuuuge pieces of onion and there were so many pieces in  the rice I had to pick out all that I could out.  Huge chopped raw onion in the garlic rice killed the experience for us. Not sure why it was in the rice this time but it was not good.  From a cook family to another, I'm sorry but I don't think we will be coming back for that. Which sucks because this location is closer to home. We asked for extra gravy twice, our server forgot. We went early so it wasn't busy. We asked for a different drink and they forgot that until the food came out as well.  No one came to refill my water either. I don't like to complain but those are basic restaurant services.  :)",

Service is always great and gives you that ohana feeling, plus the Hawaiian reggae music totally sets the mood. I wish we could eat here more, the only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wish all of their locations would either add additional seating or expand so there isn't such a long wait during peak times. Even adding some tables outside could help. Put that in the suggestion box haha and thanks for the ono breakfast!",

From the AMAZING and consistent service to the phenomenal array of breakfast goodies, I can't get enough of this restaurant.  Food - Okay, I don't eat many refined carbs but I snuck a bite of their basic buttermilk pancakes and WOW!!!!!! These were packed with delicious flavor. Totally worth the sugar spike!They have all kinds of dessert and flavored pancakes but I usually get the island omelette or basic eggs and bacon. Yes, the island omelette is for the brave I mean, who puts gravy on an omelette?! But, the gravy works perfectly! You also can't go wrong with their Kahlua pork or their huge bacon slices.  Service - Fast and friendly service really makes this place a joy to visit. I have been here many times and have never had a problem getting a table. It also helps that you pay at the front. Don't forget to tip your waitress or waiter.They're working really hard!  Ambiance - Very basic! Sometimes can be a little cramped but I keep coming back so it doesn't bother me that much. There is plenty of seating and it's great for large groups and kids that might get messy!  Try this restaurant, you won't be sorry!!!",

The flavor was on point.   Interior was clean with many tables. They definitely started getting busy as the time progressed. Hours open was 7am - this was very refreshing.  Would recommend- pricing is reasonable  Location Blue Diamond/ Durango- ample parking",

Not busy and got seated fairly quickly. We were a big group. 18 people to be exact! Luckily we came on a weekday because this place was not big.   I had coffee and the Kalua Pig Benedict. Oh my goodness. The Benedict was delish! The meat was not salty, the egg was poached right and the bread ended up not being too soggy from the egg and meat. I also had country potatoes as the side. I finished the entire plate. Really enjoyed it!   Our waiter was patient with us considering the size of our group and that half of us were under the age of 10. Kudos to him! I'm sure it wasn't easy. I definitely recommend this place for breakfast!",

The staff was busy, our server friendly, the ambiance open and a little noisy. Hubby ordered the HM1 skillet, I ordered the bacon/eggs/pancake combo, our friend ordered the sausage/eggs/hash browns combo. The timing of receiving our meals was about right for a very busy establishment, the food look and tasted good.  I was amazed at the choices of types of pancake plates one could order!  Looks like I will have to come back again and again to order them one at a time. I say this is definite place to try out when in the Southwest part of Vegas.",

This was the second trial of getting to eat here, we tried on the weekend & it was Busy. Came back on a weekday & it was great! No wait at all. Hostess & servers were very sweet.   The Portuguese sausage was the talk of town on our table. My mom wanted to know where to get it so she could get a bunch to bring back to Reno. The adobo fried rice was delicious! Not salty at all. The pancakes were delicious & my boyfriend enjoyed his crepe. We will be back here the next time we visit Vegas.",

Holy moly, it did not disappoint at all!  First of all, I didn't know where to start. I love breakfast food, but I am always conflicted on ordering sweet versus savory. I tend to go with savory, however... I am on vacation and we got it all. I am Filipino and was thrilled that there were rice options. Both my daughter and I ordered rice (adobo fried rice wrapped in egg omelette for my teen daughter, corned beef hash w/ rice for me) My friends ordered a stack red velvet pancakes for the table so we can all have some... oh my, it tasted like red velvet cake. Everything was good... the buttermilk pancakes were probably the best I've ever had.  Portions are excellent. Service is good. Friendly, helpful servers. It was about a 30-40 minute wait for us around 10AM on a Sunday, so be aware. We were busy catching up, so time went by for us. Not good if you are hungry! :)",

The place itself from this establishment was a little small, but it was very busy and organized, that traffic was going both in and out. I got their famous Adobo fried rice wrapped in egg and upgraded my side to the red velvet pancakes! I had an extra order of the Baby chick omelette with a side of the regular buttermilk pancakes and potatoes. I just have to say the food that I ordered were definitely must-haves here!  The Adobo fried rice was really good with the egg wrapped around it. I had a full meal just wrapped in egg! The shredded meat inside (unsure if it was chicken or pork) was juicy and delicious! The Baby chick omelette was so fluffy. If you love mushrooms like I do, this one is the omelette to get.   The pancakes. The regular pancakes AND the red velvet pancakes did taste the same, but they still tasted good. The red velvet seemed to just be the regular pancakes with red food coloring with different add-ons with the cream cheese and whipped cream, but I can see why it was their best seller. It's till great to get, especially for kids!   I was so full form this spot from my first visit, that I know I have to go back and try the other flavors for the pancakes and dishes!",

My favorite are the s'mores pancakes but the red velvet are their specialty. Even if you're not a pancake person the regular menu is huge .The Mexican skillet is also one of my faves . It comes with a side of pancakes so you can have the best of both worlds .  The portion sizes are pretty big so I always share with someone .   This place has never let me down . The food and the service is great . This location is pretty small . I find it best to come on a week day or around opening time .   Every time I come here the experience is 5 stars all around .",

We order adobo fried rice omelet and skillets all great portions and tasty. Service was excellent and our food came so fast. We came early and when we left there was a lot of people waiting. We will definitely come back!",

I'm still a firm believer in ambiance though.  Kick it up a notch.  I also ordered lolo ricks adobo omelette.  That was really good but it was kind of dry.  Needed a little adobo sauce or something.   Anyhow been here twice since I moved to Vegas recently and will coming back for those red velvet pancakes.",

The nutella crepes with strawberries were delicious.    The servers were attentive and efficient.  This was the outstanding part that I remember from our time at this location.   The hostess handled the crowds and table/counter seating very well.   The only issue is that I almost waited just as long to pay the cashier as we did to get in for breakfast.  It's important that  the cashier knows the menu and can make recommendations; it's another thing to be \"chatting\" with one client while a line forms.    Overall, I think that we'll be back to try other items!",

When he went to pick up the food, the person at the register asked him how he would like to leave his tip, as in, \"Will you be leaving a tip?\" My husband was caught off guard and did not expect to feel pressured to leave a tip for ordering pancakes and picking them up to go. This is extremely tacky and rude of any business. We will never be coming back or taking family here again. We truly hope their staff learns proper etiquette.",

He was so funny and not bad on the eyes plus he was a great waiter, kept our waters full and our food came out quickly. Side note, the water cups here are huge, like HUGE which I love because I drink my water like a fish.   I've been here a few times and always get the same thing, loco moco..because you can never go wrong with the loco moco, its delicious. But, today I felt a little adventurous and wanted to try something new. So, I tired the Hawaiian benedict. No regrets, the Hawaiian benne was bomb. Who would have thought Hawaiian bread an spam with gravy would have been so great. At the same time, I feel like spam with anything would make it great. Because Spam is great its \"Sizzle Pork and MMM\" cant go wrong with that slogan.  Also got the orange marmalade pancakes and my best friend got the banana nut pancakes. My goodness, both were sooooooooo gooood! I'm not a huge fan of pancakes, but I could eat those orange pancakes all day every day any time of the day.  Place was super clean and everyone staff member I came across was friendly and had a smile on their face. I will definitely become a regular here.",

However, at this location it was not great as the other Babystacks. The service was alright. The seating and serving was quick. The problem was the cook. I believe whoever is in the kitchen isn't as great as the other locations. My boyfriend ordered Eggs Benedict and I got the Loco Moco. Both eggs were overcooked. I regret recommending this place to my boyfriend and he didn't even get to enjoy his meal. Aside from that, my meal was a bit off too. The meat was too overcooked and there was hardly any rice. It was a very disappointing breakfast. I even had the special Babystacks Pancakes to go and that order was wrong. I asked for cream cheese instead of syrup. Never bothered asking for a replacement because my bf and I just wanted to leave the place. Huge disappointment.",

I personally ordered lunch today and the BLT was great .",

    "text": "Terrible food. I'm speechless! A friend was raving about this cafe, so based on her recommendation I gave it a try this morning for breakfast.  First off, I have been in hospitality for years and know what good high quality food is supposed to look and taste like.  Unfortunately this was some of the worst I've ever had. The corned beef hash was over salted and even when mixing some of the egg yolk in, was barely edible. I was excited to try their homemade Kalua pork which came highly recommended by a very nice server. Sadly, it was soupy and slimy with a faint smoke flavor added. The pancakes were the worst I've ever had and interestingly this cafe prides itself offering a vast variety of them. They were a tough and chewy inedible disaster. They looked nice and fluffy, however so much baking soda was added to give them their beautiful appearance, that it completely destroyed the flavor. I want to taste buttermilk or a hint of sweetness, not salty baking soda. And let's talk about the side of fruit, when I thought it could not get any worse. The fruit was old and obviously has been sitting in the fridge for days. Rubbery translucent cantaloupe and honeydew and old strawberry slices. I normally do not complain but I did end up speaking to the manager. Although dressed as server she, did agree with everything I said, confirmed the fruit was cut yesterday and has been refrigerated and also agreed with the horrible pancakes and Kalua pork. My meal was comped and she thanked me for bringing this to her attention. Amazingly the place was packed and based on the items I have tried I don't even want to imagine what the rest of the menu tastes and looks like.  If you need help to raise your food quality and standards, I've also been a restaurant consultant for years and would be happy to assist. Sadly, this was atrocious...",

I would think that they would not charge me for the food that had the hair in it as a courtesy, but both times I had this encounter they still charged me. They need to practice proper sanitation in the kitchen, because this is NOT how customers should feel leaving an establishment of this nature. I am secretly disgusted and would not be coming back here anymore.",

It is so hard to find a decent place to eat breakfast at on a Saturday or Sunday that does not either cost an arm and a leg, or does not have a hour plus wait. We have been to many. Babystacks is a good place to eat without much of a wait. Their prices are pretty reasonable considering you are getting a much more reasonable proportion of food. A lot of the breakfast places in the area have MASSIVE (like plate sized pancakes), baby stacks serves small and more reasonable pancakes that are equally good and much less money. This was the first time we can here and it was good, so was the service. My kids enjoyed their chocolate chip pancakes, and my wife (who isn't a huge breakfast fan (crazy I know!)) got their grilled cheese. I had their pancake breakfast with eggs, hasbrowns and sausage. All of it was good, manageable proportions, and came out quickly. I highly recommend a visit here. We will be back.",

I love how they gave the cream cheese syrup on the side so it's not drenched or covered completely with it like a red velvet cupcake! I thought the service was amazing, our coffee was refilled quickly and they were super nice and accommodating to us even when we had 2 toddler boys with us. We also had the cowboy omelette and it came with the perfect amount of ingredients- the ham, green peppers and onions and even the cheese- it was perfectly balanced. We also loved the blueberry pancakes and my 4 year old loved the banana ones. I definitely cannot wait to go back!",

With tables in close proximity you can hear EVERYTHING, even every mistake and forgotten item by the server from the guests. There were multiple bussers standing around watching the football game while there were dirty tables everywhere with guests waiting to be sat and when they did start cleaning tables took forever to clean and would drop things on the floor without picking it up, had inappropriate conversations with each other while using foul language right in earshot of guests, servers on their cell phones behind the counter, drinks unfilled... or no drinks all together, 3 hosts standing around chit chatting with each other.   I am a restaurant manager and see past most things and even give excuses but on this occasion, I cannot. If I were the owner, I'd want to know! Gave me anxiety just being there for 45 mins. With this location being so close to home and being so new, it's a shame. I will make the extra 20-25 minute drive to go to their other location or to another breakfast spot.",

    "text": "This is an off the strip gem. My friend took me here for brunch after picking me up from the airport which was smart because I was starving. This place cured the hunger pains and got me ready to welcome on a fun Vegas weekend.   The menu is large, I mean front and back large with tiny writing to fit all the options they serve. The menu covers everything sweet and savory to satisfy all palettes. The pancake selection is massive and imaginative but I had to take a stab at the Filipino options. Lolo Rick's Adobo Fried Rice....umm yes please. Adobo marinated chicken served in the shape of a burrito covered by a delicate blanket of omelet style egg. It was a quiet brunch because I was busy stuffing my face, which I think is a compliment. Meanwhile, stacks and stacks of fun colored pancakes topped with fluffy whipped cream were being served to neighboring tables and you could see the eyes of kids light up. The service was on point too. Our waiter was friendly and checked on us consistently which definitely enhanced our brunching experience. Overall it was a delicious experience and my tummy was happy with me. Definitely seems like the kind of place that belongs in the Bay Area too!",

The adobo fried rice omelet didn't have any taste of adobo, the shredded chicken was in big clumps, and there wasn't much rice. (If you want good Adobo fried rice omelet go to Aloha Kitchen) The breakfast burrito was plated on a tiny plate that made you feel like you had no room to eat or it'll fall off the plate. The cheese wasn't fully melted and was rubbery. The service was good.  The server was nice and hospitable but other than that I wouldn't go back.",

For my little and myself we were sat right away.   I already had an idea of what i wanted to order but still wanted to look over the menu. So many decisions.....Red Velvet pancakes, Kalua benedict, Loco Moco, etc.    Mmmmmmm. So ono! I opted for the BYO omelette (3 eggs, choice of 2 veggies, 1 meat and 1 cheese) thats alot of choices, i see alot of places will only give you 2 choices with 2 eggs where this place is 4 and 3 eggs!!!!! Score! It also came with potatoes and choice of toast or pancakes. I asked to swap my side to white rice of course and got the pancakes for her to eat instead of toast. Asked for Aloha Shoyu which they did have NO TO KIKKOMAN!!! Hahahahaha.  Food was awesome Service was great and the local atmosphere was great. Local music playing throughout restaurant. Give this place a try! You will be pleased!",

I could've eaten a whole bowl of the whipped cream that came on the pancakes! I only wish the portions were a bit bigger on the non-pancake items.  I will definitely come back and try something else, maybe the loco moco and the lemon ricotta pancakes!!",

    "text": "I absolutely love this place. They have two locations one on Stephanie and another one Blue Diamond. Both locations are small and always packed. But packed for a reason, they have a variety of dishes all good for breakfast and lunch.  I tried to keep it simple and I ordered the Kaula Pork grilled sandwich, instead of ordering French fries like usual, I upgraded my side to a babystack of pancakes. I settled for Ricky Road, and I was super glad. The pancakes were rich and full of goodies- marshmallows, Chocolate syrup, almond slivers and whip cream.  I almost was able to finish one stack until my son ate the rest, my lil Chocolate monster stole my stack.  But it was okay the Sourdough grilled sandwich filled with kaula Pork was good and fulfilling.  I left the table full and content. My husband ordered the Portuguese omelette and love it, he was torn on ordering the Kalbi short ribs- but the waiter suggested the omelette and my husband enjoyed his omelette and was very full. His omelette almost looked like a burrito filled with sausage and veggies.   My son ordered the quesadilla and he was a happy camper, he wasn't a fan of the fries, because they were topped with seasoning salt, so his fries were red and not the usual color. Maybe not a big deal to most, but for picky eaters it is.  Was I mad? Nope- more fries for me while he ate my pancakes:/ So overall the restaurant usually has a wait, and the locations are small. So seating can cause the lines of waiting long.  Is it worth the wait? Yes- Yes it is. Is the food good? Yes-Yes it is Would I come back again- Yes- Yes I would.....",

Friendly service and a familiar, yet unique menu.   I got Chili Loco Moco w/ garlic rice and wow. I would've never thought to put two of my favorite things together, but what a match made in heaven. The chili is meaty, the rice garlicky, and the eggs runny. It's great loco moco that is elevated by chili and cheese. I got it with a side of their homemade mac salad and that was also amazing. It wasn't over the top heavy on the sauce and was a cool contrast to the chili.   However, my partner probably got the star dish. The chicken adobo fried rice omelette with hash browns. W-o-w. Great flavor and the egg \"wrap\" really added a silky texture against the rice and chicken.   Both dishes are very flavorful and a unique take on simple breakfast items. The price is very reasonable and the portions are huge. Definitely have to come back to try their pancakes, they looked amazing but I was lured by the chili loco moco. No regrets, just have to have a return visit. 10/10 would recommend. Service, food, everything is on point here.",

I always get the corned beef hash, brother gets the spinach benedict and we split an order of red velvet pancakes to get the best of both worlds. Entrees come with a side of regular pancakes that you can substitute with a specialty pancake for an extra charge. That's typically the way to go if you want to try a little bit of everything on the menu without placing a full order of a stack of pancakes (too much for one person).",

After a bit of a wait (the place was packed), we were seated.   Everything on the surrounding tables looked and smelled amazing. I wanted to order one of each! But with a queasy stomach from too many drinks, I settled on something simple so as not to upset my equilibrium. I got the bacon and eggs breakfast which came with three strips of bacon, eggs any style, potatoes or hash browns, and two pancakes. Although simple, it was absolutely delicious. The breakfast potatoes were so tasty. And I upgraded my pancakes to try their infamous Red Velvet pancakes. SO GOOD.   So if you're looking for a great breakfast/lunch spot off The Strip, come to Babystacks Cafe.",

The hostess seemed a little overwhelmed since he was trying to man the cash register, seat people and get the to go orders all at the same time.  Any case, he got through his list of things to do and we were seated in no time.  The menu is a little overwhelming.  There were so many options to choose from - from adobo fried rice to Portuguese sausage to the variety of pancakes and to sandwiches.  Again, it was overwhelming to choose what to eat!  In any case, we placed our ordered and waited for a good 10 minutes or so and we had our breakfast.  The boyfriend ordered the cookies and cream short stack.  It came with three pancakes and a huge dollop of fresh whipped cream.  As well as a side of cream cheese syrup.  He was in heaven.  He loved every bite of it.  I had a piece and it was just way toooooo sweet for me, but like I stated, it was perfect for the boyfriend.  I ordered Lolo Rick's adobo fried rice.  It was wrapped up in an omelette and I had a side of hash browns.  It was carbs on carbs.  The fried rice was a little too dry for me.  A part of me should have asked (if it was offered and doable) if I could get the eggs over easy.  The omelette was cooked a little too well done and if it was a little runny, it would have been great with the rice.  I love runny yolk with rice.  Overall, the flavor was great, it was a little too dry for my preference.  The other items that my friends ordered looked great and everyone loved their meal.  After it was all said and done, our bill came out to less than $70, which was great considering we ordered A LOT of food.    Overall, the staff was attentive enough, the food was okay, there are so many options on the menu and the price point is decent.  Would I come back?  Why not.  I would like to try the other options they offer and they sure have on their menu a lot to choose from.",

They made us feel right at home, and then they gave us great food. We tried a couple different things, and they were all great. Awesome mash up if Hawaiian/Philipino and country style breakfast foods. Also, an incredible line up of pancakes.. Like whaaaaaaaa!! We got seasonal pumpkin pancakes that were like little fluffy pumpkin pie slices, topped with their housemade whipped cream   Also got a kalua pork grilled cheese sandwich on sourdough that was killer.  Great food. Great service. I'll be back for sure",

My go to is the Cookie Butter French Toast with a side of seasoned potatoes (because I'm always craving them.) The cookie butter is nice and smooth with a great crunchy texture, not too thick. Sometimes I wish they'd put a little more whipped cream on top hah! As you can tell, this obviously isn't the healthiest of breakfast choices.. Their pancakes are super fluffy and moist, definitely creative as well! The best thing about this spot is that it doesn't break the bank! Relatively cheap but good quality food, what's better than that??",

    "text": "Babystacks is a great breakfast place with awesome pancake options and island influence. The service is good, the portions are filling, and the price is just right.  I recommend the Two-Egg Breakfast. It's great for the indecisive diner, who has trouble choosing between a sweet or savory breakfast. And for only $6.25, you can get both in the form of two eggs cooked any style, potatoes or rice, and a small stack of pancakes or toast. And as president of the hypothetical potato fan club, I'm definitely an advocate on behalf of these potatoes. These potatoes are well-seasoned, slightly crispy, but remain wonderfully fluffy in the center. And even though rice is life, that's my shit.   As for pancake recommendations, I definitely recommend the strawberry pancakes. While the other pancakes are delicious, I find them overwhelmingly sweet and tap out after a few bites. But I NEVER get sick of the strawberry pancakes. Not only are they a classic flavor combination, the syrup tastes fresh and feels like the perfect counterweight to the pancakes.  Overall, Babystacks is definitely one of my favorite breakfast diner options!",

We typically go to breakfast with the older crowd (7am)... so 10am was late for us and we knew there would be a wait anywhere we go. They told us 20 minutes for 2 people and we hung out outside until we were called. The dining area is tiny! but we were offered seats at the high top bar area within 15 minutes. The place was slammed but our server still managed to give great customer service. The coffee was really good! There was no flavored creamer (I didn't ask) but just half & half cups. I ordered a basic 2 egg breakfast & turkey sausage - not much to say- everything was good there. The star of the show was the cinnamon bun pecan pancakes. We ordered a short stack to split and I highly regret not ordered a tall stack! These were SO GOOD. The icing & pecans really topped it off. Definitely going to return and try the other many varieties of pancakes they offer!",

Variety wise on the menu, they got it down. I was expecting a bit more because the hype was so built up. Now being able to experience it for myself, I was satisfied but not to the point where i wanted to finish my food.   I ordered the Piglet Skillet. If you want unseasoned over fried potatoes and barely any cheese and overdone scrambled eggs; I definitely recommend this dish. It was really dry, like something they just threw together on the grill without any seasonings.   My parents ordered the Senior breakfast both exactly the same except one with scrambled eggs and the other with over easy eggs. Our waiter failed to comprehend that. He thoughtfully replaces the eggs and let us keep the old eggs. Over all the food was okay, just wish it wasn't bland. Oh and mind you, we asked for condiments including salt and pepper and he failed to bring the salt and pepper.    Our waiter, he was nice at first. Greeted us once we sat down but after he brought us our order of drinks, it began going downhill from there. He checked up on us once throwout our whole 45 minutes there. I had to signal him down for him to come to our table. It's funny cause he would look our way but not make his way.   Would I go back here to eat again? Sure, if everything else was crowded I definitely would. Please season your potatoes at least.",

    "text": "Probably my favorite breakfast place in Vegas! I got lucky and this new location is right down the road from my house. It's smaller than the other location I usually visit but luckily I have visited on weekday mornings and not on the weekends. Since the location is small I would imagine if you came mid-morning or later on the weekends you would probably have to wait a while. For this reason I'd get there early if you go on the weekends.  Our service has always been good. The waiters are attentive and have good customer service skills.   They always have great pancakes and you can always add the speciality pancakes to any breakfast. This is what I always do so I can have the egg, sausage, etc breakfast with something yummy and sweet!  Today I decided to get the two egg breakfast with my eggs done over easy along with the potatoes with the tiramisu pancakes. I also decided to get a side of toast so I could dip it in my eggs. The tiramisu pancakes were the limited edition pancake so I had to try that. They were amazing! I recommend them if they are still on the menu when you visit. The eggs were also very good and I enjoyed them with my toast.  If you come here you MUST try the pancakes. You cannot go wrong with any of the different flavors they have although their red velvet is their best seller.",

Boyfriend had the loco moco, and he raved as well. We'll be back. One side note- we were interested in the adobo rice, and really wanted to try it without the omelette.

When we arrived, it was fairly busy and were told a 35 min wait. We did not get seated until over 45 min later. However, I noticed people who arrived after us getting seated and checked out before we were even seated. So either they skipped our meager party of three or they were not following their own policy of not seating if the entire party is not present. Their pancakes are good, but they were not worth over an hour & 45 minutes of my morning.",

There is NO seating outside either for while you wait. The service is average, I had to ask for more coffee and they brought a wrong order at first. So one of us had to wait while the others sat there with their food. That always stinks. The food was good, though very rich. That wasn't surprising, because just reading the menu tells you it's all very decadent. I tried everyone's dishes and they were all good, Red Velvet pancakes, Orange Dream pancakes, Lemon Ricotta pancakes and Chicken Fried Steak. We will be back.",

I ordered an adobo fried rice omelette that I've gotten many times before that was saltier than anything I've ever tasted in my life. Ever. It's like they dropped the salt shaker in the pan when cooking or the lid to the soy sauce came off or something. It was really that bad. So I had someone else try it and they spit it out.  Sent it back and they said it's supposed to be salty and if they bring out another it will be the same since it's pre-made in advance. Again, I've had it before and it was never like this. Anyone who could shovel that down has defective taste buds.  Anyway, the pancakes were perfect so this deserved a 3 star review for that.",

We got lucky and didn't have to wait in line to be seated so that was a plus. We ordered the chicken adobo fried rice and the red velvet pancakes. The fried rice was not as good as I was expecting. The rice was kind of hard and it just tasted like vinegar. The \"adobo\" flavor that I was looking for was close to non-existent. It came with a side of potatoes. The potatoes were extremely dry. At least the serving size was enough for at least two people. I also tried their red velvet pancakes. I thought it was okay as it was missing that kick of red velvet (if you had your eyes closed while eating, you'd probably think it was just a regular pancake.\" I understand that the restaurant is not that spacious but the tables are way too close to each other. I definitely came to this place with a really high expectation and I just let myself down. At least our server was pretty attentive to our needs.",

The first time, I had to go back and exchanged the order which made me late for work. I ended up eating while driving. Today, I ordered kalua eggs Benedict and they messed it up again. One of the reasons I eat eggs Benedict is because i love poached eggs with runny yolk. Of course, Both of my eggs were completely overcooked , and to make it worse, my English muffin was all soggy. So I ended up eating kalua pork with potatoes. I still like this place and eat here regularly but it's really disappointing when you're hungry & can't eat what you want. Who have time to keep going back & forth to exchange order ... although I'm sure they would've happily give me new eggs, but that's not the point. I wouldn't waste my time to write a review if this only happens once. I'm just really disappointed & probably wouldn't order here again.",

The red velvet pancakes are delicious but I didn't enjoy the burnt bacon I received. Also after drinking his coffee my boyfriend realized his cup had lipstick all over it! So we asked the waitress for a new one, then after drinking from that cup he realized there was lipstick yet again on the new cup! Yuck! Super turned off don't think I'll be visiting them again anytime soon...",

Mac Pancakes were ok, nothing to come back for.  Adobo fried rice taste more like shoyu/soy sauce.  Maybe we'll stop by again to try something different, hopefully it'll be better.",

Our waitress was really good and give her a 4+ stars.  The food....taste--2: the Lola's Adobo Fried Rice had taste --better than the Sunset Location; but still lacked the filipino Adobo flavor.  I ordered the corned beef--total disappointments I don't recommend anyone to order! My nephew ordered the loco moco; it was ok but the gravy was salty. I recommend the cooks watch the heavy hand, let us add more salt I'd needed too!",

The hubs likes the cookie butter French toast which was yummy but a little too rich after a few bites for me. We'll be definitely coming back to this place for breakfast again.",
