    "text": "Amazing service and really good food! I went with my family after seeing the blue man group. The place is located in a quiet area that looks deserted. The place is nicely decorated.  Appetizer: We ordered the red curry crab cake or fish cake I forgot. But it's an interesting flavor. I probably wouldn't order it again and try a different app, just because it wasn't outstanding in my opinion.  Main course: We ordered the squid ink pasta, arawan pad thai, and pineapple fried rice. The squid ink pasta was Amazing! Definitely would come back here just for that dish alone. It had amazing flavor and everything (pasta and seafood) was cooked perfectly. The pad thai was pretty good. The presentation of the dish was very nice and I've never seen pad thai presented that way. The pineapple fried rice was decent, not too outstanding. It tasted like any other asian place you go to.  Dessert: We ordered the raspberry chocolate lava cake. The ice cream and hazelnut strussel on the bottom were great! I'd probably just have that alone and I would be fine. The chocolate lava cake was ok. It was probably because I'm not a fan of the raspberry sauce that was inside of it. I personally would like regular chocolate instead of that sauce inside.  Service: The service was great! Our hostess was Beer (she said that was her nickname) and she was beyond amazing! Very happy and friendly and always stopped by to ask if we needed anything.",

    "text": "Arawan is standing out as one of the \"nicer\" Thai restaurants, but I did not experience the \"OMG this is delicious\" feeling I've had at others.  Ambiance is definitely nicer than your typical restaurant, but with all of this consideration, I hope they can do away with the four foot tall fan blowing in the entry way.  Thai Steak Salad with Fresh Mint Silver Noodle Salad Thai-Spiced Sea Bass Short Rib Yellow Curry Arawan Pad Thai Chicken Wings Chicken Mint  I felt like the flavors were a little more subtle than I expect to be typical with Thai, and the spiciness level was disappointing (i.e. not spicy). I do, however, recall being fond of the Pad Thai. The sea bass was a regrettable choice, as the sauce was more sweet than spicy (had a slight ketchup-y essence), and we wished we had chosen the fried catfish instead.   Service was good and they ended our dinner with a surprise birthday creme brulee for my mother (I'm assuming someone overheard my husband joining our party and wishing my mother a happy birthday). It was very attentive of them and added a personal touch.   My mother and I can't stop dreaming about the lemongrass catfish, so we will definitely be back. I look forward to finding the \"wowing\" dish.",

They went to ask us how is the food going. They seemed like knowing what we want by take a look our actions while dining, when they brought the foods after they put the dishes down. They would ask you, would you like chopsticks, hot sauce or anything else.   Then the food comes, we ordered Kho Kha Moo and Kuai Jub. It's a little bit confuse right ? I will explain them, Kho Kha Moo is the Thai Original food. It is stew pig leg until soften comes with side steamed Chinese Broccoli and Boiled Egg. Next is Kuai Jub , it kinds of noodle soup with the Thai spices marinated entrails of pig, Fried Tofu, Crispy pork, and Boiled Egg.   So that was a perfect dining experience for us. We have never been place like this before. By the way it was under 25$ of the whole bill. Thank you for reading our review. \"Strongly recommend this place\".",

The food was definitely tasty but for these prices I expected much more as most thai places that are half the price could product this quality. They have specialty dishes which you can't get at many thai restaurants. The establishment is pretty disorganized and dirty with a decor that is lacking. The service was kind of poor, initially the waiter was friendly but after taking our orders he was barely present and was not there when we needed him. As Vegas has many choices for thai food, I would pick some place else.",

In fact, we went back the next day for another amazing dinner of Short Rib Yellow Curry and Squid Ink Drunken Noodles - equally as incredible. The flavor combinations are wonderful.  Then it's time for dessert. Chef Gail creates beautifully constructed desserts that are equally amazing to look as they are to taste! Again, flavor combinations are out of this world.  On top of all of this is great service.   My highest recommendation to Arawan Thai Bistro and Dessert.  A must try on your next trip to Las Vegas!",

Entering the restaurant brings you to an entirely different atmosphere given its location. The atmosphere is relaxing and very inviting.  Our server was very polite throughout the duration of  our meal. He was kind and was very attentive to filling out glasses with water. My glass was never 1/3 empty!  Me being a meat person, I decided to try out the deep fried short ribs. I thought it was really good and the sauce that came with it really complimented the short ribs. It's something I'd definitely get again.",

    "text": "Let me start this by saying that I went to this restaurant for the first time about a year ago. This was one place that I could not get out of my mind and flavors that I could not get off of my tastebuds.  The first time I went, I was craving Thai and I was staying on The Strip. My friend, who is a local, and I had already checked out Lotus of Siam, which is literally in the same plaza, but I said that we should try somewhere new. We went online and found this place. We had no idea what to expect given the location, but we were definitely pleasantly surprised when we opened the doors. Nestled in such a plaza, we were literally taken away from that when we stepped inside the restaurant with its modern decor and well-balanced casual-yet-upscale dining atmosphere. We were seated next to some sort of a grand dessert that they had on display and my friend asked if it was real to which the waitress responded yes. We were both amazed at the presentation.  The server asked us if it was our first time there. We explained that I was in town for business and we literally had no idea that the restaurant was here, but we wanted to try a new place. We looked over the menu and after having posed a few questions, we had decided on the Soft Shell Crab Pad Pong Karee and the Thai-Spiced Sea Bass as our main dishes and ordered glasses of water and one of the blossoming teas.  When the waitress returned, she had our glasses of water which had strawberries added rather than the usual lemon and the tea as expected. Unexpectedly, she brought along an appetizer of the fish cakes as a thank you. We were very surprised and enjoyed the presentation of everything in front of us, especially the opportunity to see the blossoming tea which included an Easter Lily.  After eating our appetizer, we were wowed again by the presentation of our main dishes. Everything was perfectly spiced (this can be adjusted by notifying your waiter) and the service was excellent. We did not indulge in dessert, but we did see others eating the desserts which were beautifully presented.  Most recently, I returned and they've expanded the menu but everything is still amazing. This time, I tried the Ahi Tuna Larb and the Spicy Mint Mixed Seafood which comes with a side of steamed white rice. This is easily my favorite place in Las Vegas. If you are looking for a unique dining experience outside of The Strip, this is definitely the place.",

The restaurant is a bit hard to find since you can't see it from the street. You need to drive inside the huge parking lot around back and circle around until you see the black and white sign.  Our waiter was extremely helpful and made three great suggestions. The special pad thai with prawns was amazing. Not sure how they made it taste so good since the recipe is relatively simple. The next dish was the crispy ribeye. A good hint of basil combined with the perfectly cooked meat was outstanding. The third dish (which was our favorite) was the lemongrass catfish. I normally stay away from fish dishes since I don't tolerate fishy flavors at all, but this was totally surprising. The whole catfish (pretty big) was perfectly cut and fried with the best tasting combination of lemongrass, cashews, and other herbs I could have ever imagined. This is the one.  We finished the meal with a unique desert called thai pancakes. The sweet crepe-like concoction capped a perfect meal with excellent service. Next time in Vegas, this will be our first stop.",

We take our time searching the menu for all the goodies we wanted to try. Finally we are ready to order we start with BBQ, broccoli beef, pineapple shrimp fried rice, beef curry (mild). He has to come back 2 more times the first to tell us they don't have any BBQ beef, the second to tell us he was also out of BBQ chicken. The ambiance was nice and quiet, the service was very good. But the fact that they didn't have any BBQ ready was bothersome. The food was good not great but that can be because it wasn't my style. Lastly for the restaurant to be so lovely their bathrooms were not. They got another star off from that alone.  PS Note the no alcohol. I didn't do that before going in just because I don't drink but I was with a person who did. I do not want that to affect this review so I put a PS.",

The restaurant itself is nice when I came to pick up our togo order. I opened up the nice plastic containers to find maybe 1/3 of it full if not even less. The green curry at least had good amount of chicken just missing everything else that goes in a green curry like bellpepper or something. There were some bamboo shoots in there though. I would say the pad see ew only used the slices of the bottom stems of the Chinese broccoli. The less desireable cheap part and mainly lots of flat noodle. The fried egg rolls amounted to about three sliced diagnally into bit size pieces. If you're looking for portion control but not pay the proportional price then come here. I think I should have told my friends to wait at Lotus of Siam. At least you'll get fed right there. They live up to their yelp rating.",

I ordered the pad see ew and one of my friend's had their pad thai which was way too sweet for me. Their pineapple fried rice was super yummy, must try that!! We also ordered a couple desserts which was delicious. The Mango Island is a must try!!! The vanilla bean creme brulee was also very good. The only thing I didn't like was that they brought out our food at different times. I think they should have brought it out all at the same time because the time difference was about 10 minutes apart. A couple of my friends were trying to be polite and wait for everyone else to get their food but I told them they should just eat because their food was already getting cold. Oh and one of the appetizers we got and loved was the ahi tuna larp. I'm Laotian and I love larp, so this was different but in a good way.",

We were so disappointed when we got down the road and realized our food tasted lmoldy. Not only that we payed $25 for ribeye steak dish and the meat was well done, and mostly all fat. There was no pastry chef and they were out of a few things. While I was waiting a long time for my food I noticed a few other people sent their entrees back. Just don't go there.",

The special used to include small soup, salad, entree and dessert though I think now it only includes soup and dessert. Most of the dishes there taste great, but what they excel at are their desserts. Delicate and balanced just right in terms of sweetness. You don't get to choose your dessert with the lunch special, so I've sampled everything from mango sticky rice to panacotta to pumpkin spice cake and beyond. Honestly, I would go there just for their desserts. Recently, we suffered through several mediocre or subpar Thai restaurant experiences and it's renewed my appreciation for Arawan.",

Items on the menu have its twist of elegance and unique display. We had the Penang curry which was light enough for a hot day but well flavored. The shrimp pad Thai was uniquely put together in a egg net. Crispy duck was a bit dry.",

    "text": "Best Thai restaurant ever! This comes from some who traveled to Thailand early part of this year and tasted some of the Thailand's most well known restaurants. The restaurant's ambiance is relaxing and modern. The food tasted authentic yet the presentation is like a gourmet French dish. The size and portion of the dishes are quite good.   The Duck Red Curry is absolutely one of the best curry dishes I ever had. The duck meat are sliced duck breast joined by various fresh fruits, vegetable, and herb. There was not a drop of curry left in the plate after we're done with it.    The Squid-Ink Drunken Noodles dish is also wonderful. The high quality of the seafood ingredient in this dish mixed with sweet spicy chili sauce created a nice balanced taste.  The Crispy Lemongrass Catfish was served on a large plate with a whole fish. Deep fried with lightly battered crispy skin on the outside and fresh tender inside. The taste of the fished was enhanced by dipping it in the spiced dressing.  Unlike similar dish in other Thai restaurants,the beef in the Tenderloin Black Pepper dish is from high grade steak. It's like ordering a piece of marinaded steak with black pepper onion sauce dressing. It definitely worth its value if not exceeding it.  Lastly to finish off the meal with the Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee and Coconut Treasure. The Creme Brulee looks fantastic served with a golden-net made with sugar. The vanilla custard is smooth and tasty. The sweet rice hidden under the coconut ice cream of the Coconut Treasure is a pleasant surprise. The combination of the sweet rice and the coconut is delightful and refreshing.   I am looking forward to dine at the Arawak Bistro again for other item.",

    "text": "Wow I hope that I can express in words how much of a delight this place was from the moment I walked into the door.   The restaurant  is located in a large parking lot and from the outside it didn't seem like anything special. I was greatly surprised when I walked in to hear the sound of swanky jazz music playing in this beautiful lit little restaurant.  The atmosphere is so calming and comfortable. They set us in these comfy wicker chairs nestled in the corner of the room. I was instantly happy. But wait, it doesn't stop there! The wait staff were so welcoming and brought us strawberry infused water before we had a chance to even ask for anything. There's more!! Again, I was shocked by the service here, before we even finished ordering we had two little bowls of delicious egg drop soup places on our table. It may have possibly been some of the best I've tasted.   So the run down on the food: Panang Curry: the dish came out in a large plate with a small medium bowl of juicy curry chicken along side a gracious portion of rice.  The chicken was cooked perfect and the seasonings were excellent.   The menu had many options and reasonably priced as well. They have lunch specials for $9.95 which is what we chose. I ordered the Panang Curry and my partner ordered the Brocolli Beef.   Broccoli Beef: The portion was large, the beef was tender and the flavor was made to perfection. The chicken was definitely my favorite but need was great also.   If I could give 6 stars I would! Just when I thought this place couldnt get any better, anoghe r surprise came! The most delightful little slice of chocolate dusted cheesecake was the final touch to our oh so amazing $10 lunch special. Yes, that's right for only $10 we enjoyed a three course meal!! Tell all your friends!   5 stars across the board!!!",

    "text": "I was thoroughly impressed with this place! Not located in the best area, the plaza and overall area is old and seemed empty, so this place was a nice little find. The inside of the restaurant is modernly decorated, nice and clean, definitely not a typical casual Thai restaurant. This would be a nice place for a date, something fancier than just normal dinner. Service was good, we were quickly greeted and seated, our waitress came and took our drink order right away, plates were picked up, table was wiped clean before dessert. Service was very good.   They have a nice list of wine, hot teas, and sodas and Thai tea. Their blossoming tea was delicious, we ordered the Honeydew Sencha, very big pot, absolutely big enough to share. That tea was also very good, not too creamy or too sweet.   For appetizers we ordered: Tuna Larb, Thai Calamari, and Egg Papaya Salad. The tuna larb was delicious! Has tuna, onions, advocado, mango served with lettuce and fried wontons. The egg papaya salad was also really good, different than all others I have tried. It came with salted duck egg, cha lua (Vietnamese meat), and chicharron! I like that it is so different from other papaya salad at other Thai restaurants. The calamari was not the best, very small pieces, lightly fried but not crispy, the squid was too chewy.   Main courses: Spicy Eggplant, Duck Drunken Noodles, Soft Shell Crab Curry, Short Rib Yellow Curry, Thai Spiced Sea bass, and Tenderloin Black Pepper. The stand out dishes are definitely the short rib yellow curry and the tenderloin black pepper. The curry was so creamy but not to the point where you can sick of it quickly, the short ribs melt in your mouth, simply delicious. The tenderloin was so tender (heehee :), perfectly seasoned. The rest of the dishes are very good also, did not regret ordering any of them.   For dessert we shared: Sweet Sensation, Mango Island, and Coconut Treasure. The desserts here are similar to those at Sweet Raku in terms of the concept and the presentation. Coconut Treasure was my absolute favorite, has sweet sticky rice on the bottom, with pieces of fresh coconut, with a scoop of coconut ice cream on top, with crushed peanuts and a thin piece of cookie. All three desserts were beautiful and really good, but I absolutely recommend the Coconut Treasure.   The presentation of every dish here is awesome. They take a lot of time and care with plating their dishes, everything came out beautiful but also delicious. Would definitely recommend this place when you want to celebrate an occasion, or for dates, or even just casual dinner. Just come try this place!",

Tonight I went here with two of my friends, I noticed this time they put 18% tips for three guests and DID NOT even mention about it. And our server told us they charge every table same percent tip, But the other server said he never did that before. I was really confused, and they did not even give me a proper reason. I'm not sure if that something personal, but I just want everyone know to check you bill before you pay if they put mandatory tips just in case of double charge.",

I got the ahi larb and the Thai BBQ chicken, both were good, but the chicken could've used more garnish to eat it with, cilantro, etc.  end of the day our bill was almost 100$ for an 1 App, 1 salad, my chicken, and her pad Thai.... food was good but not good if you're looking to easy cheap..",

    "text": "There's only a few times in life that you go to a restaurant and say, \"finally...someone who gets it!\" Arawan Thai Bistro and Dessert not only gets it, but they have taken food quality, presentation, ambiance and service to the next level.  We stopped in during busy CES week for a reprieve from The Strip, and boy were we happy we did as this place blows most of those restaurants out of the water - for a fraction of the price to boot!  Sure there's no valet (typical in the Vegas restaurant scene), and it may be wise to lockup your car real well - but none of that matters once you step foot through the doors of Arawan. Pastry Chef Gail and her parents have really done an amazing job creating a warm, tranquil dining experience so as to ensure nothing detracts from the amazing lunch, dinner and dessert menu...and I don't throw around the word amazing lightly.  Signature Thai dishes that will make you sweat with happiness, delicious soups that warm and invigorate the soul, and a vanilla bean Creme Brulee that I simply cannot describe with words.  On top of everything, my fiancee and I truly felt like we were part of their family while being there, which was certainly a breath of fresh air after being cut off and honked at all week during all the CES hustle and bustle. Our Lunch server (forgot his name), and Dinner server Tanya (who made sure we didn't forget her name, haha) were so hospitable and literally jumped at every request - even while the restaurant was busy.   Hats off to the folks at Arawan Thai Bistro and Dessert  - you made our trip to Vegas. We'll be back to see you soon!   Yelpers out there do yourself a favor and try this place out ASAP!",

Came here for lunch after checking out Escapology nearby (which is also recommended) and glad we did. Lunch specials come with soup and dessert (fresh mango and sticky rice on our visit). I ordered the Drunken Noodles for lunch. It came with plenty of beef, flat noodles and veggies. Better than what I've had in San Francisco area. My son got the Yellow Curry with chicken.

Especially the rib eye. It was a very unusual item in a Thai restaurant but so Thai of that makes sense. The glass noodles were also yummy with large chunks of deep fried tofu and small pieces of egg. But the salmon?  Never arrived. Instead we got mixed seafood. Which sucks because a member of our party doesn't like calamari and it was a prominent ingredient in the dish. The flavor was good though.   Now the service. It has been a long time since I have had such bad service. We got there at 7:30 and ordered almost right away. We didn't get our food until almost 9. You read that right. 1.5 hours later. Why didn't we leave?  I think we all thought the other would think it was rude. No one asked to get us more drinks. No one came to apologize about the ridiculous wait time. No one explained why people all around us were getting served and we weren't. And the irony in all of this?  We actually were the only one to arrive who made reservations. Ugh!  I won't be back unless I hear their service, or at least their service to me, is drastically better!",

We started with the simple egg papaya salad and moved to a ton yum soup both at medium spicy (just enough for me). Then, we were astounded with the presentation of the short rib curry as well as the squid drunken noodle. Both were stunning. The short rib just melted in your mouth. It wasn't a meager portion either. And the seafood in the drunken noodle was top notch. The mussels were plump, the squid cut beautifully and generously, the prawns jumbo sized, the scallops succulent, and the fish perfect.  Even the drinks were amazing. The ice cubes in the Thai ice coffee were unusual, but made the drink \"sparkle\" visually. And, the honey bliss blossoming tea was a vision to watch actually blossoming in the see-through glass teapot.   If that wasn't enough, the deserts took my breath away. We ordered a simple mango sticky rice and it came with a delicate silver sugar arch with two colours of sticky rice. I kept eyeing the table next to me because all they ordered was dessert!  I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "In the same strip mall and within sight of Lotus of Siam the most revered Thai restaurant in Las Vegas rests this hidden gem.  The photos of food plastered on the outside may be a turn off to some, but open the door and you'll see that this isn't a hole in the wall.  Inside you'll find an elegantly decorated space that exudes a quiet and refined vibe, a big contrast to the strip mall exterior.  The staff are helpful and professional, dropping off glass carafes of ice water with mint and strawberries floating inside and answering any questions you might have with ease.    The food comes quickly, and mercifully, because the smells from the other diner's plates and the kitchen in the back will have woken your stomach from whatever slumber it might have been in and made your mouth water.  The arawan pad thai will change the way you think about what Pad Thai can be.  The noodles are held together in a net of eggs, and are light and coated just the right amount of tamarind sauce.  The mixed in chicken is tender and flavorful and the sprouts are crunchy and add the perfect texture.    The tofu wild ginger seems to defy the laws of dishes with steamed tofu.  The tofu is firm, without being rubbery or squishy and is accented perfectly by the crispy vegetables.  The soy bean sauce is beautifully savory and salty without being heavy or overpowering.  The real treat of the evening though was mango sticky rice desert.  Without a doubt one of the most sublime and subtle and yet absolutely delicious deserts I've ever eaten, regardless of cuisine.  The mango was perfectly ripe and had the most wonderful subtle sweetness and fruity fragrance.  The sticky rice was also just subtly sweet, perhaps with condensed milk, and was perfumed a floral note.  When eaten separately both were a joy to savor, but together they combined into produce a flavor that is well beyond the sum of their parts.    Arawan was never on my radar until I looked past the bright lights of Lotus of Siam's reputation, and I am so glad that I took the time to do so.  Next time I come to Vegas, I'm skipping the In-n-Out for my first meal and coming right here.",

They have great food presentation and a relaxing ambiance. My only complaint is the pricing. Be prepared to pay over 100 dollars for two people for dinner should you get a appetizer, entree, a drink and a dessert. I guess you get what you pay for though :) This is the place to go on special occasions.",

After our trip to the Grand Canyon we spent the night in Las Vegas before flying out the next day. We found out about Arawan through the other Yelp reviews and made our way over to the place with high expectations. We were not prepared for how divine our dining experience would be.  Everything.... and I mean, everything! was just perfect. The staff, the classy and understated decor, the cleanliness...... and... especially the food. The food almost made me cry. It was that special. The presentation, the exquisite blend of flavors and heat, the texture.... the aroma... everything. I was aware that this was one of the best meals of my life.  In my 60 years of eating... I have only been compelled to tip the chef a half dozen or so times. My usually exceptionally frugal wife was totally on board this time (volumes were just spoken).  I feel appreciation and respect for this chef. Maybe.... just maybe, the best dining experience of my life.... and if not, at least the best one in my memory. What a treat!",

    "text": "My wife and I decided to come here after browsing through yelp looking for a nice resto to eat dinner. We chose this place bc we haven't eaten at a Thai resto in a while and we saw some good reviews on it. This resto is located in the same plaza as Lotus of Siam (see previous review). First off, the interior caught me by surprise. From the outside, it looks like your typical asian resto but inside the setting is very clean and has that \"romantic\" feel with white tablecloths and wine glasses as part of the setting. They also have a dessert bar in the corner where I could visually see the pastry chef making/plating the desserts. I thought that was very original and quite exciting to see as a dessert maker myself. We had the following:   Fried Tofu $6  Baby Back Ribs Special $19  Thai Spiced Sea Bass $28  Spicy Mint Eggplant $10  Mango Island $12  The Baby Back ribs dish was a special that night. The ribs were slow cooked for 3 hours, grilled, and came with like a hybrid curry-adobo sauce, salad, and fried rice. It was probably one of the best rib dishes I've ever tasted. The sea bass was pretty good. Good portion size fish served on a bed of asparagus with a thai spicy sauce and a side bowl of rice. The eggplant surprisingly tasted good as I thought mint and eggplant would taste weird but it didn't. The mango Island dessert was pretty cool. We got to see Chef Gail prepare it and it was served in a wine glass. It was like a hybrid suman-creme de fruta (filipino reference alert!) with sticky rice, graham crackers, mango ice cream, and passionfruit creme, almonds, and a coconut milk sauce. The only negative I would say about the food was the fried tofu. It was store bought fried tofu so I gave it a pass since it was $6 only. Overall, we were very satisfied and kudos to Chef Jui, Chef Gail, and their staff for their great service and tasty food.    So how does this resto compare to Lotus of Siam? Lotus of Siam is better for family style dining whereas this place is a good \"date\" resto.",

Also got the signature Pad Thai and it was good too, not the best pad Thai I have had but very very good. The desserts were so good as everyone else has commented on. The prices are a little high but eating out is usually not cheap these days. Highly recommend if not just to stop by to get some dessert.",

The food is awesome, I love the yellow curry chicken. And the house wontons are amazing! I could eat those bad boys alone for a meal. I also tried the short rib yellow curry, it was yummy but my favorite is definitely the chicken. I also enjoyed the Penang chicken curry.   I do 4/5 stars simply because I felt like $18 for a plate of pineapple fried rice is a bit high. The presentation and flavor is there, don't let the extra few dollars detour you from trying it. My boyfriend and I both enjoyed it. Also comes with 2 shrimps.   Service is always amazing the staff is lovely, it's clean and even though the location may have you feeling a bit sketched out once you go inside you'll forget you're right next to the green door",

    "text": "I've been looking forward to trying Arawan ever since I started dining at Komol next door. It looks more intimidating so I knew I had to have a special occasion to try it. I brought my parents here when they were in town and it did not disappoint as an intro to Thai food in Vegas.   Most of the diners at Arawan are couples enjoying a fancy date night, though the restaurant wasn't too busy on a Wednesday night. They only serve beer and wine but have an extensive tea list. We started with a large order of Tom Yum with shrimp and the Tofu Larb. The Tom Yum was perfect with a spicy level 7 that had everyone sweating a bit. I've never heard of a tofu larb but it was a nice, light dish packed with tangy and fresh flavors. We continued with the Arawan Pad Thai, Short Rib Yellow Curry, and Crispy Duck, which is a dry rub version of the saucier Duck Palow. I've had duck a Thai restaurants before and sometimes the sauce makes it a soggy mess but this duck was truly crispy on the outside and tender inside - my dad's favorite dish of the night. The Arawan Pad Thai is as beautiful as the pictures show with its egg net presentation. The prawns are huge and go well with the slightly sweet noodles. The short rib yellow curry was the overall winner with the rich beef paired in a creamy, hearty curry. Fantastic. The only complaint is the lack of table space for our ambitious dinner.   We had to get dessert right? Well yeah we got TWO desserts: the raspberry chocolate lava cake and Mango Paradise, along with a few shots of espresso. The lava cake takes 15 minutes so the mango paradise came out first: slices of mango served with two mounds of colored sticky rice, each with a slightly different texture. It's served with an eyedropper of condensed milk, though the dish is pretty sweet on its own. This is a great twist on a traditional Thai dessert. The raspberry lava cake is a little more familiar to most: a fluffy chocolate cake injected with raspberry sauce and a side of sorbet. Everything was presented beautifully and Arawan really elevates the Thai food experience. If you want to eat Thai comfort food with a couple friends, Komol may be the best choice but when you want to really treat yourself come to Arawan!",

The inner design is a bit luxurious, the staff are friendly. The dessert making table is located on the front of the house, you can watch them make dessert while you eating.  Starter: Chicken satay: the chicken was tender and the sauces on the side taste amazing. Sweet and sour.  Lunch special: I really recommend this place for lunch if you are not in hurry. For only $9.99 you can have lots of options and it comes with soup and dessert, you can't beat that.  Drunken Noodles: I love drunken noodle so much so I ordered it here. The drunken noodles in arawan doesn't have dark color, I thought i might need to add some soy sauce, I didn't add it after first bite, because they seasoned it so well.  Dessert: Cream brulee: the presentation was so nice. The bowl shape cover was sugar. The Arawan plate was made of chocolate. The cream brulee tasted creamy and sweet, very satisfying.  Cons: There was one thing I'm not really satisfying was that they took about 30 minutes to get my food ready. For lunch special, you might need to consider the people who are coming out for lunch hour and need to go back to work.  Overall: I would come back here for Thai food again. I know that they takes so long for my food, but the taste food and friendly staff totally make up for that part.",

Really liked the fruit flavor and the longan flavor was definitely in the tea because they put the longans in there. Ordered a small Tom yum soup. It was salty and too dense texture for the soup. I think they could improve on their Tom yum soup broth. It was $11 for a small soup which I thought was pretty expensive for the size you get. The size was perfect for me and my friend though because we did not want a lot of soup to fill us up before the entree. I would say the small soup is still shareable. Also ordered the duck curry and the pad Thai. They were both very delicious. I loved the duck curry. The broth was perfect and the duck was so tender and soft which melts in your mouth. Yum yum. I also liked the grape added in it. It was different and went along with the curry. The pad Thai was good as well. Noodles were soft and the flavor was good. Liked the big shrimp pawns on top. I would say mild spice flavor here is good. It's actually mild and not too spicy cause I know Thai people love their spice but the spice level here was good and it was mild when you order it. So spice level here is how you actually order it. Was pretty full for dessert and I was hoping to try their crepe brulee but it was out so I would probably try the mango dessert next time when I have room.",

So glad I came in and checked out one of me new favorite Thai places.   Commercial Center is one of those places in Vegas that has had its ups and downs reputation-wise. However, there are so many gems here it's hard to stay away. Arawan is one of those gems. I came in for the lunch special. A very impressive deal: soup, main dish, and dessert for about $10. Pretty great!  The soup was mushroom and chicken in a simple broth. I love broth-based soups, because they act as a sort of base for my meal. They set the stage, if you will (and sometimes spark my appetite). My typical go-to Thai dish is the Pad See Ew with chicken. I loved it here. The chicken was cooked perfectly, the sauce was tasty and not overpowering (sometimes Pad See Ew sauce is kinda too sweet for me). The dessert was a \"tiramisu,\" but I am pretty sure it was cheesecake... Not really sure. The dessert was decent, more of a nice addition to the meal.   All in all, I am a fan. I need to come back and try more of their other dishes. Their unbelievably well-priced lunch special makes that affordable to do!",

    "text": "Came here during our mini-vacay, literally like 20 mins before they were to close. They kindly still served us and did not rush us out the door as we enjoyed our meal.   I should disclose that my significant other is Thai, so I feel like he would know what good Thai food would be and we definitely both agreed the food was excellent.  We ordered crab fried rice which was made with adequate amounts of real crab. We also ordered tom yum soup with shrimp, portion was enough to share. Broth was light but flavorful. I am subtracting 0.5 stars because it literally had 3 pieces of shrimp but that did not take away from the flavor. For our meat, we ordered the beef salad medium well, mild spice - this was very good also. Beef was cooked to order and portion was enough to share as well.   For dessert, which yelpers recommended we order, we ordered the Sweet Sensation which consisted of freshly made roti (Thai crepe) drizzled with condensed milk and granulated sugar with fresh banana inside. The roti was soft and warm, and not too sugary! It also came with a scoop of Thai tea ice cream. The ice cream was excellent, robust in taste but not overpowering. They also included a side of fresh diced strawberries. Ugh my only regret is we didn't get to try the entire dessert menu because there were so many!  Location is a little bazaar but parking is ample. Servers were accommodating and very helpful in making our order choices good.  I am subtracting another 0.5 stars because of the prices. They are a little over the top however, I definitely think they are worth the try! Might be our new favorite Thai restaurant in Vegas!",

    "text": "Unexpected surprise. My fiancee and I were trying to find a Thai restaurant that was in the middle between her and I that evening and this place came up. It was an early supper time mid week deal and we were both very hungry. With that in mind the place was just about empty, so it allowed us to see how well taken care of the place is despite the outward appearance of the rest of the strip mall. We are Coptic Orthodox and it was during our Great Fast (Before Easter) so we were limited to vegan options and seafood (don't tell, we can't have fish on this fast). Either way the options for both were plenty. We went with a vegan Tom Kha, it was perfect made and seasoned. We also had a nice salad with soft shell crab, also delicious. The service was great and the waiter even remembered us for when we brought our siblings over the next time a few weeks later.  I highly recommend",

Main course was served less that 15 minutes after ordering. That will make sense later.   The Thai lemongrass wings were dry and tasteless.  After reading the reviews, I ordered the Arawan Pad Thai.  The Pad Thai is served in an egg lattice that holds everything together.  It was clearly pre-made hours/days before we got there.  Bland (at medium heat) and soggy.  This was definitely heated up quickly after ordering. I ate about 25% of it.  My wife ordered the crispy duck.  It came out so dry you would think it was pot roast. Again less than 15 minutes after ordering.  This restaurant if off the strip, in the same strip mall location as the old Lotus of Siam restaurant. I wish Lotus was open and I didn't make the mistake of choosing Arawan.  I cannot imagine this is a one off with all three items being horrible.",

They do tea which I highly recommend. it comes in a french press and you get a small cup to drink out of. For $6 it might seem like a bit pricey but it is worth it. As far as food goes I had the food twice. When we went I had the chicken satay which was delicious. I also ordered from their lunch menu thru Postmates and was very satisfied with what I received. The orange chicken is great, the rice was not bad (I mean it's rice... not much else to say) but the best thing was the little dessert that comes with it. It was a sweet rice with fresh mango and blew my mind. Unfortunately they don't really do tea delivery (understandable) so definitely recommend coming here and enjoying the food and drink.",

    "text": "Arawan Thai has been making waves in Vegas for their classy Thai dishes and beautiful desserts. I've tried two of their lunch specials and am excited to be planning a dinner there soon. Dishes are well-executed and vibrant, desserts are as tasty as they are beautiful, and both sections of the menu offer creative dishes not found elsewhere.  GARLIC SHORT RIB: The actual meat portion is small, but that's short ribs for you. The flavor is spot-on, heavy on the garlic and brightened up with a tasty tamarind dipping sauce. The ribs are meaty with a small amount of fat for flavor. Side this with steamed veggies instead of the rice for less carbs.  SPICY MINT CHICKEN: Careful with their spice scale, \"medium hot\" will hurt a little bit! This ground chicken dish is packed with peppers and topped with a fried egg, for a fun mix of flavors and textures. I'd specify over-medium in the future rather than straight-up fried to add some oozy, yolky goodness to the mix.  DESSERT: Thai tea creme brulee was perfection! Delicate sugar crust, creamy custard, and the bright, spicy flavors of the tea made for a fun take on a classic dish! Similarly, their sticky rice and mango is infused with a punch of fragrant, fresh mint.   Lunch specials come with soup, salad, and dessert, for a steal at $10- great opportunity to try some more cautious dishes before throwing yourself into their full menu, with dishes like short rib curry and rib eye crispy basil. Their execution of the lunch dishes has convinced me to return for dinner with a bigger appetite and budget. Glad to have a new Thai option in town that actually adds something different to the local scene!",

    "text": "I'm not a local, but when I asked a local for the best Thai, the name I was given was Arawan. I wish I knew about this hidden gem the last four years I've visited LV. I also rarely write reviews, but Arawan earned this from me with the great time I had.  Tea: This is what brought me here in the first place, I NEED proper tea with Thai food, and their tea menu is fantastic. I was given a large press full of fantastic Jasmine tea for the same price as a cup of Starbucks on the strip.  Chicken Satay: An easy way to get a feel for Thai restaurants, in my opinion, is chicken satay. Arawan's was wonderful. I loved the plating, and the peanut sauce was heavenly. Not too sweet, but paired perfectly with the well seasoned and moist chicken.  Garlic Short Ribs: I was concerned they would be overcooked, as deep fried short ribs tend to be. However, I was not disappointed. I also enjoyed the sauce that it was paired with.  Duck Noodle Soup: Much bigger than I expected, and the broth was amazing. The duck was tender and flavorful, and the noodles were cooked perfectly.  Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee: I had to get the rest of dinner to-go, but after seeing the dessert menu, I couldn't resist. I was not prepared for what was put in front of me. There was a beautiful piece of artwork made from caramelized sugar, a dome protecting the creme brulee itself. Once I cracked it open, it was like unlocking a hidden treasure. The fresh berries with the silky custard was phenominal.  Lastly, the service. I was alone, sitting at the bar, and was given excellent service. Everyone there was friendly, and I was well taken care of. I will be back again next trip, and potentially one more time before I leave this trip, even if just for tea and snacks.",

Arawan resides in the same strip mall as the venerable Lotus of Siam. Having dined at both establishments on several occasions I can confidently state that Arawan is better.

    "text": "Okay I didn't think any other place could compare to Lotus of Siam but Arawan Thai Bistro is up there. For one, there was no huge line, you can make reservations and the waiters and waitresses are always available. Now on to the food.   To start our foodie night we ordered the Arawan fresh rolls which were just like any fresh rolls from any Thai restaurant but their homemade chili sauce was on point. Also they gave us complementary chicken wings. YAY for us!   Next we ordered the short rib yellow curry, Arawan pad Thai and crispy pork with veggies.   Short Rib Yellow Curry- this dish was amazing.!! The short rib was soo tender and juicy. It fell right off the bone and the yellow curry paired perfectly for an amazing dish. I compare it to Lotus of Siams duck curry.   Arawan Pad Thai- this dish came with two huge prawns on top the mound of pad thai noodles. You can also choose the spiciness of this dish and we opt for mild. The noodles were perfectly cooked and the prawns were juicy.   Crispy Pork with veggies- I'm not sure if this is the correct name of the dish but I always order this dish at all Thai restaurants. It's such a simple dish but whats different for me is the sauce they use. There sauce was great! The crispy pork wasn't over done and too crispy, it was just right. The sauce went well on top the white rice.   In conclusion I believe this place will eventually have a long line just like Lotus once more people come here. This is a must try Thai place.",

    "text": "Located inside the historic commercial center district on Sahara, this restaurant is a little hard to find at first. My GPS took us to the Onyx theatre and said we had arrived, but it turns out they're right next door to Komol, facing west. That's right, there are 3 notable Thai joints competing for your loyalty in this plaza, with Lotus of Siam also a few steps away. Thai cuisine lovers, choose your poison wisely!  Well-kept and Western-influenced, with a touch of modern-rustic. Rattan chairs with cushions and a wooden motif throughout. The dessert preparation station is akin to something you'd see at a crafty Pinterest couple's wedding, which is becoming an increasingly popular look at new restaurants. Our friendly server promptly gave us food recommendations and strawberry-infused water, which he continually refilled. A small jar of fresh flowers sat atop our table. Nice touches like that make a difference. (Bathrooms could use some work, though.)  We sat in for their $9.95 lunch special, which occurs 11a-3p weekdays. This price included soup and crispy noodle chips to start, followed by an entree with rice, AND dessert! Yesss, that's something pretty unheard of. Beautiful presentation. I got the chicken yellow curry and my brother got the thai bbq chicken. My curry was smaller-portioned, compared to other places, but still satisfying. The chicken was tender and carrots thoroughly cooked. I hate when other restaurants seem to rush the process and I end up with hard ingredients in my curry.  Service is tops~! Maybe because it was fairly empty when we went, but our waiters were so attentive and periodically dropped in to ask how everything was. (One even held the door open for us on the way out.) The dessert of the day was a chocolate caramel pecan tart, which another employee garnished at the dessert station. Not as elaborate as some of the other dessert pictures (creme brulee), but a good way to wrap up an enjoyable lunch.",

    "text": "Dessert included with lunch special. What? Dessert? I'm there!  This what got my attention and probably one of the things that sets Arawan Thai Bistro and Dessert apart from the more popular and renowned Thai restaurants here in Commercial Center.   For this first dining experience here I can only speak for the nine dollar lunch specials they run from 11-3. Well rounded selection of entrees to choose from. The section of the menu has beef, chicken and veggie options. So our main course we had Thai Bbq Beef and Yellow Curry Chicken, along with Egg Flower soup as our starter and side of salad greens. Everything was delicious.  The consistency of the curry was more liquidy than I've become accustomed to, but the spices and taste are spot on!    The dessert presented for today was Cheesecake with Raspberry. The small cut of cheesecake turned out to be the perfect portion and didn't feel no guilt whatsoever having that decadent bite! Very obvious made from scratch ingredients and prepared that morning by their very own pastry chef.  Who by the way just made a beautiful wedding cake. Next visit I plan to make room for a full portion for sure!   Definitely impressed once we stepped inside for early lunch. Contemporary and minimalistic decor and soft jazz tunes playing really set a more classy, yet casual tone here. The service was great. Table service type restaurant.  Nice touch with fruit infused water when you are seated.   Note: So just hang a right turn instead of left coming into Commercial Center Dr. otherwise you'll end up at that green door place like my friend did.   They have crispy duck on the main menu! (Arawan Duck) Looking forward to coming back here and trying it next!",

    "text": "When you're in the same lot as the two of Vegas' best Thai restaurants, you'd have to be special in order to be noticed. Otherwise, you'll be ignored/forgotten.  We had dinner reservation. I was impressed by the modern decor atypical to most Thai restaurants. They only had two diners when we walked in and there was nobody to welcome us or seat us. I was thinking we were off to a bad start but the two diners assured us that it's worth it.  Our server was a pleasant, soft-spoken gentleman who always had a smile on his face. We got some Thai iced teas (no Arnopalma!) and they gave us strawberry-infused water. The entrees and desserts were amazing! Their level of heat: mild, medium and spicy. We got everything medium just to be safe.  Fried Tofu: This was alright. I'd skip appetizers and head on to entrees next time. 3.5/5  Thai Beef Steak Salad: Citrusy, spicy and refreshing. The beef had some fat I had to trim off but other than that, this was great. 4/5  Ribeye Crispy Basil: Slices of wok-fried ribeye with mushrooms, bell peppers, garlic, chili and crispy basil. Great aroma and flavor. The steak was tender. 5/5  Squid Ink Drunken Noodles: Squid, shrimp, scallops, fish, mussels, and mushrooms with spaghetti in squid ink, spicy chili sauce. If you love seafood, this is a must-try. 5/5  Mango Paradise: The sophisticated version of sweet sticky rice. It has the flavor components of the classic sweet treat but presented in a much more elegant way. 5/5  Sweet Sensation: I love Thai tea so, I had to have this. Bananas wrapped in Thai pancake drizzled with condensed milk with Thai tea ice cream and Oreo crumbles on the side. Soooooo goood!!! 5/5",

Ordered Singha beer, egg rolls, and Spicy Mint (basil) with beef.   Beer was great, egg rolls were mushy, and the entree was incredibly salty.  I ordered the entree medium hot at the advice of the waiter and it was not spicy at all. The beef in the entree was ground.  I thought that was weird.  The services was good and I did not try dessert.",

By the point I'm starving, so I took out the pieces of chicken so I can start eating the curry and I asked the waiter for a side of shrimp. He told me he had to take my whole dish away even though I insisted I'd eat around the chicken and to just bring out a side of shrimp....the waiter then said that if I keep the dish he'd have to charge me for chicken curry AND shrimp curry.  Are you kidding me?!  It was your mistake, the food took forever, let me just eat the mistake instead of you guys redoing the whole dish, I would've been completely fine with a side of shrimp. He took the dish away, and the remake also took forever, my brother was done with his entree by the time my correct curry came out.  Not a pleasant dining experience when we each have to eat our meal alone. It place is also in a sketchy, dingy part of town and the decor in here looks tacky, you're better off going to the strip for the prices this place is charging.  We bought thought our dishes were totally average.",

Their mango something dessert is a must try, no clue what it is but its so wonderful. I also recommend the Tom Yum soup with shrimp with a little spice and then the egg rolls- seriously to die for.

The ambiance of the restaurant was very modern with a hint of Thai tradition, the service could've been a little better but the server was alone so I don't blame her for the delay it was completely understandable. I will definitely visit this place again when I return to Vegas. I only wish I had the opportunity to try the delicious looking deserts. It's a must try especially if you don't want to fall into the lotus of Siam hype. Great food!",

Other restaurants just don't make their food as good, or as spicy, or as reasonably priced as Arawan does. It has become one of the top Thai restaurants on my list in Vegas. It doesn't look nice on the outside, but once you get inside it is very nicely decorated it looks completely different once you're inside. I recommend getting their Arawan fresh rolls as an appetizer and ask for the peanut sauce instead of the sweet chili sauce. They will accommodate you. Their Thai style calamari is pretty good too. They also give as complimentary these crunchy chips with a sweet chili dipping sauce. I wish you could order a bigger portion of it to munch on cause they are actually pretty good. The food is amazing from their green curry, to their red curry, to the panang curry, to the pad Thai. My boyfriend loves getting the duck panang curry. I usually stick between these dishes mentioned but I don't doubt everything else is good too they are pretty spot on with the flavors. Their desserts are so creative and delicious like their mango island dessert served in a wine glass it is pictured on the dessert menu. The sweet sensation dessert is another I would recommend with Thai tea ice cream. And their Thai tea drink is delicious as well I get this every time I dine there. I come here quite often and like I said I have never been disappointed! I love this place!",

The presentation of their dishes is more sophisticated & it offers more entree-type options. The food is still delicious & the service is excellent.

When you first walk in, the relaxed ambiance hits you.  The staff was wonderful.   The chicken satay was cooked to perfection!  Bomb!  Peanut sauce was creamy.  Cucumber Salad and flavorings were tasty with a mixture of sweet and spicy, but not overly done.  The Pad Thai presentation was wrapped in a netting and didn't disappoint.  I'm anxious to try the Spicy Mint eggplant on my next visit.  If you love THAI, you'll love Arawan.",

I had the pineapple fried rice with chicken and shrimp and I asked them to make it spicy and they added the perfect amount of heat to it. They serve tea in this fancy glass tea pot with double walled glass tea cups (for you everyone at the table). Do yourself a favor and leave room for dessert because you don't want to pass on the scrumptious selections. I had lychee sorbet inside a chocolate sphere served with candied tropical fruit and warm raspberry sauce. It was a dream. So good!",

The food is, for the most part, your basic Thai food. I would say that the pad thai tasted better than others I've had elsewhere (and I've had quite a bit of pad thai over the years!), but the eggplant was pretty average (and was not digging the copious amount of onions included in the dish, which usually doesn't come with spicy eggplant). I would also note that the portions are smaller than what I'm used to. So if you're coming really hungry, maybe order extra and take home the leftovers.  I really liked the decor. I thought the dark wood and bright red accents were really nice. It was a lovely dinner date spot, and I'll definitely come again when I'm in Vegas.",

In the same totally rundown strip mall as Lotus of Siam, Arawan is hidden behind an even-less inviting exterior.  Two steps through the door and you realize you are in for a special experience.  The interior is simple but lovely with comfortable seating throughout.  We were greeted by a lovely waitress who explained all the unusual menu items.  Each dish was sublime in both flavor and presentation from the Tom Kah Gah through the beautiful, handcrafted desert.  A memorable dining experience which we look forward to repeating.",

Last night (01/04/17) at 7:20 I arrived to get my food order, 2 entrees and 2 desserts totaling ~$75. The young waitress who took care of me was sweet over the phone and when I arrived to pick up my food. There was an older Asian waitress (maybe in her 40s, slightly bigger woman) there who took care of my check. I was here for about 20 mins, and I'm not sure why but I had to interact with this woman more than the waitress who greeted us and took my order over phone. The older woman was rude when I needed to enter my pin for payment, which by the way, I have never been asked to do before at a restaurant so I had to walk to the busy back area to do it instead of signing the little slip. Then, I still for some reason had to sign the little slip. When she handed me my receipt to sign she didn't look at me but shoved the tray at me as if she wanted me out of her face..wtf?? For as much as I pay here, good customer service and courtesy should be expected. Idk if it's because I'm young/brown/whatever, but I have family members who are/were servers and I tip well because of it. I probably won't come here in the future as there are other good Thai places in town where I won't be treated as a second rate customer. BTW, the actual food was good, although not great.",

I would venture to say it was somewhat disrespectful.  if this is the kind of service I can expect from Arawan Bistro because I was dressed in a t-shirt (that I purchased on a day-trip to Los Angeles and the Farmer's Market on Third and Fairfax).  they can expect that I will author very negative comments on social media and conversations with anyone who I talk to about restaurants in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "I stopped here before going to the Smith Center to see a show.  I was the only one in the restaurant during the entire time I was there, so things were quiet and service was excellent.   After checking the menu--it's different than the one online--I ordered a small bowl of Tom Yum soup.  For the main course, I ordered soft shell crab pad pong karee.  I also ordered a Thai iced coffee.  When I was asked for the spiciness of both dishes, I was given a scale of mild, medium, or spicy.  I asked for medium to spicy and the server said I'll put medium ++.  My receipt shows them both as medium.    Before ordering, I was brought three fried wonton pieces with chile sweet and sour sauce much like noodles in a Chinese restaurant.  The iced coffee and a glass of water and a carafe of water were brought.  There was a fresh rose in a glass on the table.  When my soup came, it was perfect.  The right size for a person dining alone and seasoned spicier than medium but not burn your mouth hot.  The broth was excellent.  The soup was not overwhelmed with lemongrass as some Thai places do.  This was an auspicious start to the evening!  Then the soft shell crab was brought along with a small bowl of rice.  The spiciness of the crab was opposite the soup.  In fact, there was little flavor to the sauce itself.  The flavor of the dish came from the crab and the vegetables in the dish.  On a scale of 1 to 5 for spiciness, this dish was 0. This was a big disappointment!  I should have ordered the duck as I was planning.  I ordered the sweet sensation banana Thai pancake with Thai iced tea ice cream.  The dessert was fine.  The pancake was tough and the ice cream had little taste.  The presentation was excellent with a small square of chocolate with the Arawan logo on it.  Service was excellent and not simply because I was the only person there.  I can see the people giving courteous and friendly service to all customers.  The room is nicely done aand so open compared to the restaurant it replaced.  I'm not sure if I will return.  There are so many good Thai restaurants that we have to choose from and there's no reason to accept an entree lacking as much as this was.",

We enjoyed it all. Pad Thai may have won the day but there were close seconds like the black ink squid drunken noodles and the panang curry. Great and speedy service. 5 of us ate for $200 tip included.  We will be back.",

Birthday boy's birthday was that day but we were going to have dinner the next day and I mixed up the days. Whoops. They were very accommodating and didn't hesitate to fix my mistake.  They do set expectations that the food will not all come out at the same time and will probably take longer. This is expected with a large party especially since we didn't want the set menu. That is the best part, not having to use a set menu! Their food came out pretty fast though aside from that.  Got the Arawan pad thai and it was pretty good. Nice presentation on the egg wrap. Their desserts were amazing! The mango dessert and the coconut ice cream. I don't exactly remember the name of them. I'd say everyone ordered an entree and dessert.  They also did something nice for the birthday boy! I will be back to try everything else!",

Their Orange chicken is also delicious; the right amount of crispness and the citrus flavor is well balanced with the sweetness of the sauce (where many places seem to overdo the citrus). Finally, their desserts are amazing. The mango island is refreshing and light, absolutely amazing. A must try.",

Very good service and food came out fast as well.  We were a group of 7 and ordered many dishes to share and I liked them all.  It was a bit pricey given the restaurant settings were just basic.

We randomly found it online when we were initially looking to go to Lotus of Siam. It's located in the same sketchy strip mall, which is about 10 minutes from the strip. I can definitely overlook the strange location (right near strip clubs/swinger clubs/tranny joints per our uber driver!) for the quality of the food.  I started with the small Tom Yum soup which was amazing. It had incredible flavors and was so authentic with pieces of lemongrass, galangal, and kaffir lime swimming in it. The soup had mushroom and big shrimp in it as well. I did not want that bowl to end! It brought me right back to my cooking class in Chiang Mai and I was in heaven.  I also ordered the Pad thai with tofu which was also delicious. I judge a Thai place by their Pad Thai and most unfortunately, do not get it right. Arawan delivered with authentic Pad Thai that I could not stop eating. I was stuffed to the brim by the end and was so sad to leave some tender well flavored noodles on my plate. The spice was just right as well.   Service was great and so was the pricing. I only wish a place like this existed in the Philadelphia area!",

    "text": "Elephant of the clouds--the fighting one Brother of the sun, Arawan!  4.5 Stars...I'm rounding this one up because they take care of niceties better than any Thai Restaurant in Vegas. The best gourmet Thai Food in Las Vegas!  Arawan Thai Bistro and Dessert is in the same center as two of the better Thai Restaurants in Las Vegas (Lotus of Siam & Komol). I wondered if they were good enough to be in the same center as these restaurants or just foolish enough...turns out that they are indeed \"good enough\" and in many ways better.   Arawan distinguishes itself from the rest of the pack. They are refined and composed in a way that few other Thai Restaurants are while still maintaining integrity for the flavors. Take their Arawan Pad Thai as an example. This is one of the absolute tastiest Pad Thai dishes in town; but at the same time, this dish is taken out of the ordinary with a couple lovely variations. The noodles are encased in a netting of egg and the dish is finished with the placement of two giant grilled prawns on top. You don't have to take my word for it. Arawan has some of the best pictures of Thai food on Yelp...even the cellphone pics taken with horrible lighting manage to look alright.   We enjoyed all of the following: Arawan Pad Thai Ribeye Crispy Basil Panang Curry Chicken Silver Noodle Salad Squid-Ink Drunken Noodles Soft Shell Crab Pad Pong Karee Chicken Chow Mein  Pad See Ew Fresh Spring Rolls  Hardcore fans of Pad Kee Mao (A.K.A. Drunken Noodles) may not love the Squid-Ink Drunken Noodles. This is a very good dish in its own right, but one of the few that fails to shine through with some of the more traditional flavors of its predecessor.   In general spice levels are low. If you're a fan of spicy food ask them to crank it up...hot here is a medium at many Thai places and you'll need to ask for Thai Spicy if want more heat than that.  I haven't had the opportunity to try either of their whole fried fish entrees, but they look amazing--firmly established on my list for future visits.  I'd also love to make it in for lunch as their lunch specials look like a great deal, but my schedule does not allow for it.  Desserts! I could have started with this section. If you call yourself \"Arawan Thai Bistro and Dessert\" then you better come through in the dessert section! Chef Gail does. We enjoyed their desserts so much that we came back just to have desserts and a beautiful flower blossom tea. My favorite is the Mango Paradise. I like mango sticky rice in general, and Arawan succeeds in elevating this classic dish while incorporating an incredible traditional technique of incorporating dried butterfly pea into the rice. Mango Paradise Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee Sweet Sensation Chocolate Pecan Tart  A couple comparisons: Arawan rightfully bills themselves as gourmet Thai Food, a category reserved in Vegas for Chada Thai & Wine...maybe Nittaya's Secret Kitchen and some Asian fusion spots if you want to stretch things. While Chada has the edge in ambiance and a spectacular wine program, Arawan's dishes are more polished, more collected and plated better than both Chada and Nittaya's.  Please understand that this is not the same food you would find in a hole in the wall restaurant in Thailand. If you are looking for what some would call authentic (what does that even mean anymore?) Thai food then go next door to Komol...or make the drive to Pan Asia or Thai Food To Go. But if you're simply looking for incredible food then make your way to Arawan.",

The menu is composed of classic Thai favorites, but everything is elevated far beyond the typical Thai neighborhood joint in terms of flavor, ingredients and presentation.  Had the Short-rib Curry and Pad Thai ... both were phenomenal...  The curry was full of flavor and had the perfect heat level.  The star of the dish was the short rib... succulent and falling off the bone. A perfect protein to complement the richness of the curry.   This Pad Thai was excellent... presented beautifully with the freshest of flavors and ingredients.  Very artful and delicious expression of Thai cuisine... Save room for dessert!",

Initially, we were served ice water typed with astrawberry slice.  Pretty and different.   The meal begins with their egg soup. To be honest, I'm not a fan of egg soup, but theirs was quite good. Second, we were served a spring medley with a tasty vinaigrette. The soup came after. It was delectable. Just had the right amount of lemongrass and chicken. Then came the meal. Let's just say I ate all of it. The curry chicken was perfect. Spicy 5. Just enough to make your nose run in this cold weather. The plate of mint ground chicken also disappeared. To finish the meal, we were served a small square walnut brownie. I wasnt too impressed but my 2 year old killed it.   Needless to say, we'll be coming back.",

    "text": "Dear friends + great food + amazing dessert = Dinner at Arawan Thai Bistro.  Seven of us gathered here for Sunday dinner and shared several dishes, family style. Hearing so many good things about Arawan, I was looking forward to the Mango Paradise dessert most of all.   But first, dinner:  -Ribeye Crispy Basil -Arawan Pad Thai -Squid-Ink Drunken Noodles -Panang Curry Chicken -Soft Shell Crab Pad Pong Karee -Chicken Chow Mein (yes, this is on the menu)  I didn't have the Squid-Ink dish because I don't eat fish, but I tried every other dish.  Standouts were definitely the Pad Thai with the huge prawns as well as the Panang Curry Chicken.  I also really enjoyed the Soft Shell Crab dish; it was maybe only the second time I've had soft shell crab and the curry flavor was just right.   The desserts were works of art.  You can definitely just come here for them if you want to treat yourself.  -Mango Paradise (Thai Sweet Sticky Rice with Mango):  I finally got my fix after not getting any last weekend at the monthly Thai food festival.  I kinda wished I didn't have to share. -Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee:  This was a lovely presentation.  We called it a spiderweb of sugar which covered the creme brulee and fruit.   -Sweet Sensation:  the Thai Tea ice cream with this dessert was fabuloso.  Add the roti with bananas and it is sensational.  Service was excellent and, all in all, a wonderful dining experience that I look forward to repeating soon.  *Reservations are recommended.",

Had a glass of grape juice and fermented grape soda which were awesome!!   We went straight to ordering food. Had their fried calamari app and a cucumber salad. Both paired nicely a nice sweet cool salad got the spicy-ish dipping sauce that came with the squid.   She had pad se ew the noodles chew to them noticed they're are wider and longer than other places.   I had the short rib in yellow curry or was it Green? Any ways the thing was literally off the bone delicious.   We left full and happy!!   Thank you",

We got the:   rib eye crispy basil (3/5) panang curry (5/5) drunken noodles (4/5) crispy shrimp rad na (2/5) sweet sensation (3/5)  Overall the food was a 4/5 but the service could have been a lot better hence the rating. We had to call upon the bus boy for most of our needs ( 2 water refills, dessert menu, bill, and etc.) plus the forced 18% gratuity for 5 people didn't make us feel better about the service.",

Located directly next store to Komol and steps from Lotus of Siam, this is the newest Thai restaurant in Las Vegas  is only a few months new. This was our first time any of us dined at Arawan - which I selected.   After looking over the lunch specials my client asked me to select our lunch which I jumped on the opportunity. I chose the Thai steak salad with mint, crispy lemongrass catfish and short rib yellow curry. We were brought out egg flower soup with crispy fried noodles which tasted different from any egg flower soup I've encountered. It was yummy. We then received the steakThai salad which the beef was tender and delicious, followed by the short rib curry which was another hit. Lastly the whole deep fried catfish arrived, it was beautifully stunning and tasted as delicious as it was presented. The lemongrass sauce for dipping was the just right flavor and not overbearing.  Overall my client was impressed as I was with the decor, food and service. I'll definitely be returning my next trip to Las Vegas.",

There spice level is not consistent, the soup we had asked for 5 on the spice scale, which was spiced correctly. So for main course, we stuck with 5 and it was bland to a bit tangy. Perhaps the good reviews are for non vegetarian items. The fried tofu was very chewy. Overall, I would rate this place sightly below average for someone who is expecting authentic Thai food.",

We originally wanted to eat at different Thai restaurant but we stumbled upon this place since they are known for their desserts.  Our group consist with 4 adults and 2 kids.( 6 yr old and 2 yr old)  We quickly ordered our food since the kids were hungry and anyone knows kids can't wait for food so most of servers know to order kids food fast before adults food.( common sense)  All adults food came first and we kept waiting for the kids food and it end up arrived twenty minutes after our food came.  The food taste okay, nothing special. I wished I could try the dessert but I had no more room for sweets.   The bill was really surprised us since the server ' Luis' added tips on the bill even when our group were only four adults with two small kids.  Coming from NYC with a lot of restaurant experience, the tips usually added on party of 6 ( adults) and more. ( common sense that kids are not tipping) The tip is gratuity based on service, so why on earth we got charged 18% for bad service?  I was a bit embarrassed since I was the one suggested this place for dinner.  If you do try this place, check your bill when you get it and make sure you get good service before they charge tip on your bill.",

It was a bit busy, and looks like short of staffs as lunch time goes to last one hour, like our wait-person did not show up at the right timing.

The lunch deal is awesome, I believe it was around $10/$11. This gets you a soup (I'm vegetarian, and the soup of the day had meat in it so I got fried wonton strips and dip), an entree and a dessert. I had the pad thai, and my mom had the yellow curry. The portions were pretty large for lunch. The pad thai was on the sweeter side, and I usually do not enjoy sweet pad thai, but this was exceptionally good! Dessert was some sort of Christmas themed custard cake.   Service was friendly and efficient, and we both enjoyed the strawberry slices in the ice water.   The dinner menu is considerably pricier, but the meals are more elaborate. I would definitely recommend checking this place out if you're craving Thai in Vegas!",

I know I know, Lotus is like a Vegas icon but Arawan takes it up a notch.  The inside is nicely decorated and tables are set for a quite lovely atmosphere.    We had spring rolls that were served with sweet chili sauce.  They were good-very fresh, but I prefer the peanut sauce served at other places.  Red curry with chicken and yellow curry with chicken was selected by my dinner companion.  She likes it so spicy!!  Wow.  She ordered the spiciest; I usually am more on the cautious side  it decided to try it.  It was not as spicy as said level would usually be.  But they were both some of the best curry I've ever had.  I ordered the prawn pad Thai-it looked pretty on the menu and that is my go to when I first try a new Thai restaurant.  It was more sweet than I prefer but it did not stop me from devouring it.  Added some chili garlic sauce and lime and yum!!  Other go to is Tom kha soup-I would have eaten four bowls l-yes that good.    Do not skip dessert here.  The dessert chef is a friend of a friend and she creates so well!  Two words-mango gelato-could their be anything better?    Final thoughts. If you or your group are really wanting to go for a nice Thai dinner-go here.  Have lunch at Komol another day",

I got the tofu green curry and it was super yummy. It had a lot of flavor and spice and I loved that they gave us the option to choose fried or steamed tofu. I chose steamed to make myself feel like I was eating a little healthier haha They also had excellent service and put a strawberry in our water which I enjoyed. In the end, we asked them to fill up our water bottles for us and they were very nice! My friends got some sort of pad Thai noodles and I tried them as well. It was very yummy :)",

Got here when they opened and service was quick.   We had the calamari to start which was good. The pad Thai was good too, not dry like some I've had. The crispy catfish was the standout dish. We devoured it between the two of us, which was shocking cause the fish is big enough for 4 people. The sauce it comes with is amazing.   We'll definitely be back when we're in town!",

We have never been disappointed with their lunch specials. They get it right every time. We are vegetarians and love the fact that they can adjust to our needs by ensuring that no fish oil is used for cooking. We usually order the Thai Basil Rice, Drunken Noodle and Penang Curry. These dishes have always been delicious, full of flavor and presented beautifully, which is commendable since this is a lunch special. The value for money is absolutely great! This restaurant is a must visit for lunch specials. They have ample of parking available since the strip mall (somewhat empty) is really huge. Looking forward to our next visit.",

    "text": "The food was pretty darned good, we had the braised beef curry, the duck, garlic ribs, phad see ew, cucumber salad, amongst other dishes, of which I can't all remember.    The food is kinda pricey but the braised curry and duck (both specials) were pretty damn good.  The braised beef was so tender and the curry was just the right flavor.  The duck on it's own was decent, but paired with the dipping sauce they provided made it a definite hit.  The rest of the items were standard, and the garlic ribs were actually a little sub par.  It's pricey because it's gourmet thai food, and a little fusion-ish, but we had our kids with us and it is not the most kid-friendly environment.  The dishes are beyond their young palettes too, so if you want to get your typical thai food to satisfy a craving, you can prob get decent thai close by without busting the wallet, esp with little ones.  Be prepared to spend here, esp if you want to have the good stuff.  Our server mentioned to us that they were rated on trip advisor as a top dessert spot, but it was kinda late already and the items we would've selected were going to take at least 15 - 20 minutes long...and it was already like 9:00PM.  it would have been nice to have been notified of that much earlier, but our server either misjudged how far along we were in our dining process, or forgot to mention it at the earlier time.  So we didn't opt for the dessert, but saw the table behind us get almost every item on the dessert menu, and they did look pretty darn good.  Hope to come back soon to try it.   Service was pretty good, he sold us on his favorite items, which I liked very much, but he kinda struck on the failing to give us enough time to order dessert....but he was super friendly and helpful, and joked with the kids too.  Parking is pretty open, it's a big plaza, and I don't think it gets too insane.    I gotta agree with Gracie J about the location of the restaurant tho...I know that could possibly not be entirely their fault about their location, but I'm sure there had to be some part of the decision processs that involved going there...and I would not typically think high-end gourmet Thai when I first enter the Plaza.  I hate to do it, but that knocks off a half star right there...you don't feel so comfortable driving in, esp at night, let alone taking a cab, lyft, or uber there...you would think you weren't in the right spot.  And speaking of the right spot, it is incredibly hard to find...we drove around the parking lot for a while before we finally found it.  Maybe a tip on what's nearby might preove useful to some.",

    "text": "This restaurant reminded me very much of my fine dining experience in Chiang Mai, Thailand. The decor, the music, and the food were comparable. The only thing that was lacking considerably was the service and attentiveness of the servers or lack thereof.   I had a reservation booked and when I walked in, I waited 7 minutes to be seated. There were plenty of open tables however the servers were busy serving tables. One server acknowledged that she saw me, but didn't care too much to seat me as she grabbed the water jug to refill water cups instead. Considering how upscale this Thai restaurant is compared to other Thai restaurants in Vegas, one would assume there would be a hostess available. Nope, because all three times I've visited, I spent at least 5-10 minutes waiting by the door as the available tables were screaming for me.  Aside from the subpar service, the food was amazing! The Pad Thai was exquisite and tasty. The noodles were sweet and the chef was very generous with the chicken. The Pad Thai was plated beautifully in a cross cross egg pouch and garnished with what looked like sweet potato chips. The dish itself was rather pricey at $18, but that didn't keep me away from coming back again for the Pad Thai. It is also offered as a lunch special entree. The lunch special costs $9.99 and comes with soup and dessert. Take out lunch specials do not come with soup.  The Tom Yum soup with shrimp was another favorite of mine. It had the perfect amount of sweet and sour flavors. My favorite part of the coup was actually the mushrooms. I'm usually not a huge fan of mushrooms, but I was definitely one with this dish. Definitely coming back for this again!  The Thai iced tea was nothing special. I would skip this next time. It tasted like creamer and didn't have too much tea flavor. The person who made the Thai iced tea was a little heavy handed with the ice--my cup was more than 3/4 full!  The restaurant is more upscale than other Thai restaurants you would normally find in Vegas so be prepared for higher prices! This spot would also be perfect for a date with that special someone!",

The Pad Thai was nicely flavored and not too sweet, as some can be. Duck Red Curry was amazing with a really good amount and variety of vegetables I usually don't see in curries. the duck still retained a little crisp edge.  And. Then. The Mango Island.

The Tom Kha soup might be the best I've ever had, and I've had many, both here in the US and in Thailand.  The service was very friendly, attentive, and super polite.  Dishes were well-presented and all three that I ordered were delicious.  The restaurant is clean and presentable, the menu is just the right size, with a lot of variety but not overwhelming, and the dessert selection is outstanding for a Thai restaurant.  My only knocks on Arawan would be that the prices are just a little on the high side for a restaurant that doesn't really have a 5-star location or ambience.  The decor is nice, but a little cheap, and the location leaves something to be desired.  That being said, I wouldn't hesitate to come back or bring my friends here.  All in all, I was very torn between 4 or 5 stars, the food and service are 5 stars for sure, but the decor and location are closer to 3.",

Arawan is a cute little restaurant with a fairly small menu that's almost double the price of most the restaurants. We went there for lunch and my husband ordered the Thai beef salad which cost $20. Yes $20 for some steak on top of lettuce. No rice included. He said the salad was good but the meat was not high quality and a little hard to chew. For $20 you should be getting a good quality meat. I ordered the glass noodle salad which was good but again overpriced. I paid $16 for my salad which is basically some noodles with ground chicken and only 2 shrimp. I get much more food at Archies for a lower price. The dessert was good. We had the mango island which cost $12. My coconut juice was $5.00 and my husbands Thai tea was over $4.00. All in all we spent over $70.00 for two salads two drinks and one dessert. They do have a lunch special which had limited items so it may not be so bad if you go and order from the lunch menu. There is just to many good Thai restaurants in town to pay so much for similar food.",

I'm so glad I came here instead! The Tom Yum was fantastic and if I could of ate more I would have! I highly recommend this place to any one lucky enough to be in the area! I will be coming back for sure!",

The food is amazing, the service is amazing, and the atmosphere is amazing. Way better than any Thai place I have tried, way better than Lotus of Siam. The owner and his wife own this place along with their daughter who is the pastry chef. They are all so nice and friendly, they always greet my family and I since we have been loyal customers. We love this place!",

Service was outstanding!  Super attentive servers.  Ambiance was great - very clean and modern design.  You would never know you are in a strip mall from the Inside.    Food was delicious and so fresh.  Highly recommend the tuna appetizer - we would have rated that as a main course!  The spicy mint with beef was great and so was the drunken noodles with shrimp.  We ordered everything at medium heat, which may have been a little too spicy for my husband, so be specific on heat level.  To end the meal we had the creme brulee and it was so beautiful - just as nice as a five star restaurant dessert!  Highly recommend and will be coming back soon!",

    "text": "Finally a place that lives up to the hype!   . This restaurant is located in a shady shopping center on Sahara between Maryland and Paradise.  Lotus of Siam, Komol, Haifa, and Cornish Pasty Co. are in the same shopping center.   . Went on Saturday 1-23-16 at about 6pm. The outside is straight up scary but inside it's like being transported to a swanky bistro with dim lighting, lovely modern decor, nicely dressed wait staff, real flowers on the table, strawberry infused water....very peaceful and tranquil. They do have high chairs for the kiddos.   . $57.32 got us a thai coffee, thai tea, egg rolls, crispy basil ribeye, pad see ew, and a creme brulee.  Complimentary fried wontons were brought to the table. I could have eaten a whole basket of these...they were wonderfully hot, crispy, salty, and came with a zesty dipping sauce.  I loved them.  . $12.00 Pad See Ew with chicken- Well seasoned flat noodles with chicken, scrambed egg, and chinese broccoli.  This was absolutely delicious.  It reminds me of the version at Thai Food to Go.   . $19.00 Ribeye crispy basil- Strips of ribeye with perfectly sauteed veggies.  I loved the pod of fresh peppercorns (never seen that before) and the lotus chip on top. The dish feels very elegant yet comforting.  . $9.00 creme brulee- hands down the most beautiful thing I've ever eaten...I was so sad to destroy it!  It was topped with fresh fruit, an edible violet, and a breath-taking sugar cage.  It was perfectly bruleed on top and the consistency was decadent and creamy.  It looked like they used real vanilla beans which I don't think I've ever had before but it was quite wonderful....they give a very subtle vanilla flavor.    . Egg rolls were hot, crispy, and filled nicely.  My only complaint would be the thai coffee...it was pretty terrible.  It tasted like they used irish cream Coffee Mate creamer instead of half & half.   I did not enjoy it...it was like drinking Bailey's.  Husband's thai tea was good, however.   . I think the mark of a good restaurant is wanting to come back....and I can't wait to go back here.",

    "text": "Found a new Thai place to eat at: completed.   Took my Sugar Toosh out last night for his birthday. We were not disappointed. Well, we're alcoholics, and they don't have their liquor license yet.  So - fellow alcoholics, beware.  Also, we both liked this place better than Lotus. I don't get the obsession with that place. Yes, it's good. But I've heard from a lot of people it's not the best in town, and I couldn't agree more.   The only thing is some of the seafood tasted a little too *fishy*. It could just be me.   Here are the things we ordered:  Awaran Pad Thai - super yummy. They add chicken and shrimp which is just what we like. Some people didn't read that part and got upset about the chicken.  Whatevs.   Crispy Duck - my favorite. I love crispy duck. I love it even more with curry sauce, so that was the only thing I was missing. But they cooked it so well, and it wasn't gamey or tough. Perfect.   Scallops Green Curry - this was my fishy dish. I don't usually thing scallops taste that fishy. We order them pretty often. The curry itself was delicious. But the overwhelming smell of the scallops made me not want to eat more. My fiance loved it, so maybe it was just me.   This is a pretty little joint in that weird plaza on Sahara. I feel like they could do a creepy murder movie in there. But that doesn't ever stop me.  I love little places that the food tastes super authentic and they're NOT CHAINS. I hope this place continues in popularity and that they're able to get their liquor license soon. We'll be back either way, for sure.",

    "text": "Checked yelp for a good Thai restaurant in the area and that's how we came across Arawan. Took a taxi from Aria and got lost as the compound where it's located is quite big, we eventually found it and boy am I glad we did! The restaurant is quaint and has a bit of a sit down dinner type of vibe to it. We were greeted by very friendly employees! We ordered the Pad Thai, Short Rib yellow curry, red chicken curry and the mixed vegetables. Let me start with the Pad Thai, the presentation was beautiful! The pad Thai noodles were wrapped in an egg and had two prawns on top of it, it was so delicious! The beefy curry was one of our favorites, the flavor is just so unique and delicious (a must try!), the mixed vegetables were also so delicious, it ha Brown gravy sauce that tastes like nothing I've tried before, the vegetables were cooked to perfection. We only ordered a few dishes to save room for dessert.   For dessert we ordered the ff: 1. Mango Island - I believe this is their take on the traditional mango sticky rice. The presentation was beautiful and the taste and texture were perfect. I love that they put crispy waffle and crunchy almond and the coconut sauce tasted so fresh! The ice cream they used must be homemade as it was so creamy! Must try!  2. Coconut Treasure- this is basically coconut ice cream (dairy free) with sticky rice, peanuts and coconut milk. So good! I love their homemade arawan chocolate that comes with each dessert entree.   3. Raspberry Chocolate Lava Cake- this takes 15 minutes to make so I suggest ordering it ahead of time. This is a dark chocolate lava cake with strawberry ice cream, fresh strawberries, raspberry sauce and hazelnut streusel baked to perfection! This was my dessert of choice and it was awesome! It wasn't too sweet nor overwhelming.  All in all I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT, clean place, quaint ambience, awesome Food and great service!  Good job Arawan!",

For the main course I had 'Pad Thai' lovely egg net decoration and tasty!!   And lastly don't miss desert in Arawan!!! I could say it's one of that place that you must have the desert. I had 'Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee' It's like love at first sight. Another one I had was 'Mango Island' everything is home made and delicious! Worth to have!

A year later, I was trying to remember which Thai restaurant we had been to and mistakenly made a reservation at Arawan. After contemplating on canceling my reservation at Arawan, we decided to go ahead and keep our Saturday dinner reservations based on other reviews and guess what...we were glad we didn't! The ambiance and food were better than Lotus of Siam. The menu wasn't as extensive, but had everything we were looking for. We were definitely impressed and will be back on our next visit!

    "text": "Came here for dinner since Lotus of Siam quoted more than a 1.5 hour wait and it didn't disappoint. I'm actually glad the wait was long at the other restaurant as I wouldn't have stepped foot in here otherwise. Located in a strip mall, you wouldn't think Arawan Thai Bistro and Dessert would be fancy on the inside. On a Friday night, there was no wait. I'm definitely surprised because the food and service (friendly and attentive) here are fantastic!  Arawan has the usual menu items seen at other Thai restaurants, but they offer dishes with a unique twist as well. Food is meant to be shared family style, so I definitely recommend doing this. Everything we ordered for dinner was packed with flavor...nothing disappointed!  To start we had the Thai-style calarmari, ahi tuna larb, and tom yum soup. Although all three were good, my favorite between the three appetizers was the larb. The ahi tuna was fresh and nicely coated with the spicy lime dressing. Mixed with mango, avocado, and green onions, this larb is a must order. I'm generally not a fan of tom yum soup, but I liked the one here. The lemongrass flavor was present, but not overpowering. Also enjoyed the generous amount of shrimp included in the dish.  For entrees we decided on the duck drunken noodles, Thai BBQ chicken, and garlic short ribs. Loved the drunk noodles. There was more than enough duck in the dish for everyone to enjoy. Noodles were cooked well and the sauce packed just enough heat. Vegetables were fresh, but I could have done without some of them. The Thai BBQ chicken was juicy, tender, and had lots of flavor to it. I especially enjoyed the crispy skin. The accompanied sauce wasn't necessary, but complimented the dish well. Although good, the garlic short ribs had to be the least favorite of the three entrees ordered. They were crispy and garlicky, but fried a little too long for my liking.  Despite the fact I was full at this point, I couldn't resist ordering dessert. The banana puff was different and calling my name. Luckily I was able to convince my dad to share it with me! The banana ice cream was fresh and tasted homemade. I appreciated the caramel drizzle and liked how it wasn't drenched on top of the ice cream. The bananas brulee were great. Not too sweet and all had a nice crispy sugar crust to them. The puff pastry was crispy and added nice texture to the dish. So good! Definitely a must order. I also tried the affogato which was a great pick me up if you are just starting your evening. The shot of espresso offered is definitely strong.   Wash everything down with a Thai iced tea or a fresh lemonade and you won't regret coming to Arawan!",

I loved the interior decor here, intimate and perfect for date night. Service was 5 stars. I also enjoyed watching their baker prepare a beautiful cake at the bar.

However... everything else we had was a disappointment.  The presentation here is spectacular! Attention to detail and plating but the food was bland.   We ordered 4of the recommended specials,  crispy duck,  soft shell crab salad, squid ink noodles and pad thai.   Duck was so dry I thought I was going to choke.  Soft shell crab was good, the squid ink noodles were good but all the seafood in the dish had no flavor.   The pad thai was overly sweet.   We also ordered a seafood soup that was just very average",

She explained the menu very well to where she intrigued me to get the $9.99 lunch special. It's a salad, soup, entree and dessert all for 9.99. That's awesome.  Soup and salad were small portions. I like that size though because you aren't full by the time your entree gets there. Basic salad with a peanut dressing. A very lite and delicious egg drop soup.   I got the pad Thai and made it spicy. Extra peanuts. Great flavor. Chicken was cooked great. My buddy got the short ribs and I tried them. Great flavor, able to bite right off bone and great portion size. It was followed up by a caramel flan that had kiwi and strawberries on it. Very very tasty.  It was a small dessert so it wasn't overwhelming. Great way to end a great priced, portioned and tasting meal. Definitely coming back soon!",

Arawan can be described with three simple words:   \"Michelin One Star\".     No need to write anything further.  Seriously.   Must try for anyone who knows and appreciates fine foods.",

    "text": "Thai food in Vegas? ARAWAN IS THE ONE! Especially for their lunch 'cause the lunch special is definitely worth it.  FOOD: Like I said, there is a lunch special from 11pm-3pm on weekdays for $9.95 that includes soup, entree, and dessert. The soup changes every day, I think, and we got the Tofu Vegetable soup with our meal. For entrees, my friend got the Pad Thai and I got the Panang Curry. You can choose your spicy level. My friend asked for no spice, but she said it was still spicy. But she still still enjoyed it. I liked my curry, but just wish it came with a bit more rice because they give you way more curry. For dessert, we had a pudding cake type thing (?) that was pretty tasty.   SERVICE: Quick and kind service. Our food came out pretty fast. However, when we asked about the dessert, he didn't know what it was.   ATMOSPHERE: The outer appearance doesn't do justice to the inside. The inside looks very fancy, has cool decor, and is very inviting.   Overall, the food was good Thai food at a reasonable price. I'd definitely go back for lunch and try one of their other entrees!",

    "text": "Although I wasn't expecting much since I am extremely partial to Chada Thai and Wine, I did think Arawan would be better given the great photos and positive reviews. Sadly, my meal was a total disappointment.  I ordered the Vegan Tofu Larb and was thoroughly disappointed at the lack of noticeable rice powder, cabbage or cucumbers, and underwhelming level of their  interpretation of \"Thai Spicy\". Seriously though, I could have had my dish 5x hotter than what I was served and I do not believe that no one in their history has ever asked for hotter (as I was informed). If so, I suppose I should start carrying a bag of ghost chilis in my bag cause what others think is incredibly spicy tastes like a bell pepper to me.   Since the Larb was pretty meh and quite small, I decided to order a vegan pad Thai. After some back and forth about whether the dish could be made gluten free, the order was repeated and then placed. To my dismay, what was brought out was encased in a mesh of egg. Since the vegan pad Thai at this restaurant has egg, I sure as heck don't trust their gluten free. Needless to say, I left hungry.  I gave the restaurant one final chance with dessert and ordered the mango sticky rice. At $10, the dish is incredibly overpriced. I liked the plating and presentation, although blue/gray rice is NOT appetizing and I would seriously hope they eventually change that. I also did not understand the chocolate stuck into the sticky rice and I highly doubt it was vegan.  Overall, I did not feel the food at Arawan was truly authentic, nor did I feel that the restaurant was capable of serving the dietary restrictions they advertised as having the ability to cater to. Also, on an awkward side note, the server was rather inappropriate on several occasions and I ultimately left feeling extremely uncomfortable. Honestly, 3 stars might be a bit too generous. If you're looking for Thai, save yourself the trouble and go to one of the other amazing restaurants in Vegas.",

That's definitely not worth the $22. The yellow curry that it was cooked in had good flavor, though. However, I'm very disappointed because I had high hopes for this place. I also got the Tom Kha Chicken soup and didn't care for that either. It had an overpowering vinegary taste. Maybe that's typical of Thai cuisine, but I'm not a big vinegar fan. Also, the restaurant decided not to take off my Yelp discount, which did show up on my order upon completion. Not cool! That's the main reason why I'm giving it one star. I don't like getting cheated like that. They need to honor these discounts if it's on my completed order. The guy was nice, but that was it. Too expensive and not good quality, so I won't be back.",

Each entree is good for one person at the most, which is unlike most Thai places.   The desserts look fantastic and I am sure they tasted fantastic. However, we were not super adventurous and decided to try their chocolate mousse cake. It was fantastic. I wish we could have tried their creme brulee which looked like it was masterfully crafted.

Arawan is definitely located in a strange neighborhood/ part of town (not to mention we were there in the dark) - but, it is Vegas. We found the parking lot seemingly pretty busy and were pleasantly surprised by the overall feel and decor when we walked in. We did not make a reservation (for 2) but might be a good idea as they were a little busy on a random Monday night.   We love Thai food and have our fav that we order back home - red coconut curry. We ordered the spring rolls, Pad Thai (other reviewers raved about it), red coconut chicken curry, chocolate cake and coconut sticky rice. - we were starving but it was a ton of food!!!   Overalll the food was excellent. The curry was awesome, the Pad Thai was good - not as epic as other reviewers said though. Desserts were amazing.   Pros: fairly priced, excellent food presentation, good Thai, local and off the strip, in-house pastry chef with awesome desserts.   Cons: strange neighborhood, not a place to eat at if you are unfamiliar with Thai food (probably why some reviewers didn't like the food), make a reservation so you don't have to wait.",

Although, my Thai aunt - who is somewhat old fashioned, would strongly disagree with me. Unlike my 62 yr old aunt, I am an ABT so our disagreement may be due to differing standards based on locality (But I like to think it's because of the wide generation gap) :)   The pad thai was chewy (good). The jumbo prawns and the level of sweetness were the two main characteristics of this dish that made it stand out among your standard, everyday American Pad Thai that is served in 90% of the Thai restaurants in the States (i.e. ketchup instead of Tamarind sauce, regular shrimp instead of large prawns).  The restaurant's ambiance had a pleasant warmth to it. Also, the pastry chef was an artist with the desserts she created for our table - she provided good taste both in art and on my pallet.  With heavy competition just across the street (Lotus), I am really pulling for this restaurant  to survive. But honestly my worries are unjustified. This place will do just fine.",

The ambiance is really cool and I would definitely come back and recommend to others.",

The owner was very nice and made it obvious that he cared about how we felt.   The restaurant is very clean and decorated nicely. The seats were very comfortable.   There is plenty of parking but a tad bit hard to find.  The complex is huge and it seems that every other store in there is out of business.    If you are looking for a thai place near the end of the strip and you dont want to have to travel to China Town District where parking is insane during busy times, head here instead.  You wont regret it.    The food is good.",

Since I've been reading great reviews about this place , I said let me just go ahead and try. I was planning to order take out only, but the moment I open the door I felt a relaxing vibe, so I decided to stay and enjoy my meal. I am very impressed my pad Thai and sticky rice dessert taste fantastic! Everything is elevated version of all Thai Food. For sure, I'll bring my friends and family here! I'm happy to find this place, finally excellent food! Pricing is worth it!",

I yelped to see what was closeby and this place popped up and I had to read the reviews and look at the photos since this place had 5 stars.  It's rare seeing a place with so many reviews have 5 stars so naturally I had to check it out.  Thanks to Yelpers, I was able to see what they had for lunch specials so I called in my order for the garlic short ribs and a beef pad thai.  Their dessert of the day was creme brulee and they apologized that they couldn't give that to me since it was baked in ramekins so they offered Thai Ice Teas in place of dessert.  That was perfectly fine with me since I had forgotten to order some when I called in my order.  Upon entering the place I thought, oh man, where am I?  The decor was very tasteful, it reminds me of my favorite places in NYC.  My boyfriend said the bathroom was very impressive and that he would want to sit down and eat here.    The staff was super helpful and nice.  Our food came out shortly after we arrived and I scarfed down the food in the car as we were going shopping right after that.  Oh man, the garlic ribs were soooooo yummy!  They were a little salty but so good!  The pad thai was on point and I love the dressing they used on their salad.  The Thai tea was a little on the sweet side but still really good.    We will definitely be back and hopefully have enough time to sit down and enjoy the atmosphere.",

I just love the food here. It's SO delicious. The presentation is always so pretty and unique. Service is consistently good. I always tell my guests that of course they want to go to Lotus of Siam because of its accolades, but if you ever can't get in... Arawan is a very close second- so just walk a few doors down. However, I actually prefer it over Lotus!",

    "text": "Someone turn on the AC because this place is HOT.... like temperature wise. They don't have an AC- even after asking for their small cooler to be turned up I was still sweating.   The food is as good as it is beautiful. All of the Thai restaurants I have been to up to this point sort of blend together. Arawan stands out. The decor is very modern, the presentation of the food is Instagram worthy and the food doesn't give you that post-MSG hangover feel.  Their food is light and flavors subtle. Also beautiful presentation does not= small, their portions are big!   Chicken pad thai: Mild, medium, hot or no spice. My dad went with no spice and loved it. I would suggest going with mild. Pad thai doesn't taste like pad thai if it's not a little spicy!  Beef yellow curry: My favorite out of the dishes we ordered. It really stood out and was different from previous curries I've had. It had a ton of meat in it! Too much that I couldn't finish it.  Pineapple fried rice: Very, very subtle taste of pineapple. It was perfect.   This was the first Thai restaurant that I've been to that gets the rice to curry portion right. Good job guys. I didn't end up with leftover curry and no rice like I normally do :)  Will be back to try the dessert!...... In the winter when the AC is not a necessity. They have large party rooms with tatami mats in the back. The pictures make them look nicer than they did when I was there... The outside of the restaurant is not fancy. You get a perfect view of a deserted parking lot, swingers club, discount dentist and raunchy costume store. This would be the perfect place to take your girlfriend on a surprise date with a blindfold. Take if off once you get inside ;) With a little more work Arawan could be 5 stars!",

I LOVE their Arawan signature pad thai, it's super delicious and I order it all the time. Their service is great and their food is phenominal. The pricing is a bit above average, but you're paying for the quality of your food.   I highly recommend this place to everyone! It doesn't look like much outside, but inside is really nice.  I'm not one to order alot of dessert either but theirs is really good, especially the presentation. Go on guys, try this place out! I'm planning on hosting a small get together for my birthday here too :)",

A little more pricey than typical Thai fast food/restaurants...it still sports an affordable meal for those special occasions or weekend date nights. Still you get what you pay for...the servers were all attentive and took their time to recommend favorites...and made sure our party were topped off with beverage and our meal was of no concern.

My wife had the Short Rib Yellow Curry which was also amazing.  I would definitely recommend both these dishes.  Our kids had Pad Thai with tofu and they really enjoyed it as well.  Most importantly, save room for dessert.  Everything looked good in the menu but we decided to go with the Coconut Treasure and the Mango Island.  Both were excellent.  If you have to pick one, I would recommend the Mango but if you have room, get both.  The pastry chef here is amazing!!!

    "text": "AHHH-MAZING! From the ambience and decor to the food and the staff. Everything was literally perfect. I've been trying to find the best Thai food in Las Vegas for quite a while and I think I might have just found it.  My friend requested this place because she said it was sooo good. I was down for something new so we went. Honestly, when I first entered the plaza, I was skeptical because it was located in a dark and sketchy place. I didn't want to get robbed! I also noticed it was the same plaza as the famous Lotus of Siam. Anyways, we requested a reservation for a party of four like 15 minutes before we arrived and they accommodated for it. When we entered I was already freezing my butt off from the cold and they quickly changed our table farther away from the entrance. So considerate.   It is a very small restaurant that probably seats up to 40ish people. The decor was modern, simple and delicate. They even had soothing ambient music playing. The staff was seriously so incredibly nice and caring. Overall it has an amazing ambience.  We ordered calamari and chicken satay bites for our appetizers. Ugh so good. I want some more. The calamari was so crispy and it was seasoned with hot peppers and salt like your traditional salt and pepper wings from a legit Chinese restaurant. It brought back some good memories. And the chicken satay bites were cooked perfectly and the sauce was delicious.  For our entrees we ordered the Arawan pad thai, pork pad see ew and orange chicken. I seriously fell in love with the pad Thai. It was so perfect and my spice level was on point.  not too spicy but just a kick. The presentation was so cool. They cover the pad Thai in an fried egg lattice. How cool is that!  I didn't try any of the other entrees but everyone said they loved their dish. We all finished our plates and it definitely filled up up.  Even though I was stuffed I had to order dessert. Duh. There's always room for that. We ordered the creme brulee and the mango island. The presentation again wowed us. It was almost too beautiful to eat. The creme brulee was also covered in a lattice but in sugar form. The dish was so delicate and delightful. As for the mango island it was a twist on the traditional mango and sticky rice. It was so good. It had mangos made into a few ways, it's purest form, gelato, and a sauce.   It was arranged so that you can get a little bite of everything. It was heaven!   I definitely recommend this place and I already want to go back. Try everything. Literally I could die right now from how good it is.  Oh! And \"go to the bathroom\" as you walk to the bathroom they have a private little dining area that resembles a Japanese tea house! So cool!",

I really enjoy coming here for lunch and the employees are always super nice to me.  Put this on your lunch rotation :)",

When we got in, the server were really friendly and seated us right away. The place seems to be quite modern, and the music they played as a background sounds like you're in France/Italy. We ordered the Tom yum, Arawan pad Thai, and the short rib with curry. Everything was delicious! My favorite, however, has to be the short rib. It was soft and melted in my mouth. As for dessert, we ordered the mango island and the lava cake. I enjoyed the mango island quite a bit. The sticky rice is very different from other places and tasted amazing! If you want a high end Thai experience, this is the place to go. It was a great experience overall :)",

    "text": "Located in what might be the seediest strip mall in Vegas, Arawan proves the old adage that you shouldn't judge a restaurant by the number of hookers working the neighborhood. The ambiance inside and well-balanced cuisine make Arawan one of the best Thai spots in Southern Nevada.  We came for lunch, both of us ordered one of the lunch specials ($10 per entree), beef broccoli and Thai Mint Chicken. The chicken dish is really Thai basil chicken, not sure why they call it mint. We did look at the regular menu, it is far pricier. The specials come with Tom Yum soup and a small scoop of coconut ice cream.  The food wasn't too salty and had just the right amount of gravy. You could immediately tell the chef was formally trained.  The server wasn't very attentive, but he got the job done. The water they poured was also exceptional, it must have been filtered.  If you're in Vegas, I'd recommend trying Arawan, just make sure your car doors are locked.",

Even with the sketchy location.....on the inside, you feel like you are in a high end restaurant the way its decorated. The food was amazing! I enjoyed every dish we ordered. The prices for everything are reasonable as well. The service was top notch and they take care of your table. Since we ordered lots of food, our table kept getting full. The servers would clear out our empty plates or even transfer to a smaller dish so that it all could fit on our table. I felt fancy because even our water was garnished with a strawberry in it. For sure I'll be back. Food soo good that I don't mind traveling far for it.",

    "text": "tl;dr -- The food was pretty good when it finally came out, but it was most definitely not worth the condescending attitude of our server and the long wait time. This place does not deserve to be ranked first place on TripAdvisor.  We came here to celebrate with our military friend before he had to return to Afghanistan for his service. This was a rather important occasion to us, particularly because our friend had never had Thai food before. He was looking forward to this place that was rated #1 on TripAdvisor.   One of us had already eaten, so he planned to get a dessert while we ate. When he asked the server for the dessert menu, he told him we would have to order from the regular menu first before we could order dessert. -- OK, Mom.   We weren't sure which main courses to order yet, so we asked for a couple of appetizers first. When our server came back, we could tell from his body language that he was getting impatient with our order. We finally decided to order food with pork and duck. As we ordered the drunken noodles with pork, our server interjected to inform us that we already had pork in one of our dishes. \"Order something else,\" he said. A bit surprised about his demanding tone, we still insisted on the pork since that's what we all liked.  After our dishes were served, our server checked on us less and less to the point where we had to stack the dishes for him to make room on our table. We ended up waving down another employee to get our server so we could order dessert. For context, we walked through the door at around 8 PM, and our server did not get back to us about dessert until close to 9:30 PM. Never again.",

It's quite nice inside, but it definitely isn't trying to be in-your-face - it's not particularly close to the strip, is squirreled away in a kinda crummy shopping center, and is arguably kinda hard to find.  But don't let that fool you - this place rocks.  The Arawan Pad Thai and Arawan Fresh Roll are both some of the best Thai food I've had on this side of the globe.  The Arawan Fresh Roll is, as the name suggests, delicious and fresh, and a great appetizer overall.  But the real star of the show is the Arawan Pad Thai - it's bursting with flavor, intricately detailed, and just mind-blowing beyond belief.    You really owe it to yourself to try this place.",

I got the drunken noodles with soft tofu (I was asked if I wanted it fried or soft, so I picked the soft). then asked the level of spicy from 1-10, on which I asked for 12 cause i like mine really spicy. my sister got the yellow curry, with the level 6 for her spiciness (since she can't decide 5 or an 8). the dish came out fairly quickly. it was fresh and hot, ready to eat. to my disappointment, my noodles was not spicy at all (I'll say it's more of level 3/2/mild ?) i did enjoy my noodles, it was a very presentative dish - green bell peppers, cherry tomatoes, onions, handful of Basil's (I love basils), big chuck of soft tofu, the flat noodles was great, topped with a fried lotus root. it was delicious even without the spiciness. my sister's curry; however, was not spicy at all, way to sweet but she ate it anyway with her stream white rice. we both got the tom yum soup without the chicken meat, and it was very flavorful! I can taste the spicy from the chili oil, lemongrass, basils, and spices from the small cup of soup. so good! the coffee chocolate cake was really good, not too sweet, just moist and perfect.   I wanted to come back here to try their signature dishes-wanted to take my mom here to try out their  lemongrass crispy catfish dish. reading the description of the dish made my mouth watered but that's for next time.  it was a good lunch and I'm glad that I came here.",

There's an ample amount of free parking right in front of the restaurant. We were a bit skeptical looking around at the other establishments but when we walked inside we were surprised to find a nice restaurant and friendly staff. After being seated for a few minutes we were surprised to receive a delicious but simple fried wonton appetizer with the best sweet/salty/spicy dipping sauce! We actually asked for some more on the side to dip our calamari appetizer in (highly recommend!). We ordered the pad thai which was presented so beautifully! The lattice like top is actually egg, and topped with two shrimps (which were slightly overcooked). We also got the chicken panang curry and I asked for sticky rice. Turns out sticky rice comes with the curry and there's no extra charge! We ordered both dishes at medium heat which was a good level of spiciness for us. Our waiter also gave us some extra chili paste on the side in case we wanted it a bit spicier, but we ended up not needing it. The portions are generous and we did end up with extra curry. Too bad our hotel didn't have a fridge and micro or we would've taken our extras to go!",

I liked their wall decor and overall ambiance. Like what everyone had raved about, the plating and detail to the dishes are excellent. I enjoyed the mango island dessert the most. For the main course, I ordered the Arawan pad thai, and the flavor of the noodles were good, nothing impressive though. To my disappointment, the two prawns on top of the pad thai tasted mushy, indicating that the prawns were most likely frozen and not fresh. As for the service, it was okay; it was a bit slow and the server wasn't very attentive. Overall, while the intricate plating and detail they put into the dishes are amazing, I do feel this place is overpriced.",

    "text": "Vegas has been blessed with some outstanding Thai cuisine.  The Thai food Gods call a shady complex on Sahara & Commercial Center home.  Lotus of Siam boasts their Northern Thai dishes and Komol offers an extensive vegetarian menu. Arawan, the new kid on the block, has the WOW factor that you cannot get at any Thai place I have been to in Vegas!  I was able to dine in during lunch and dinner. By far, I highly recommend this place for dinner! I will mention that for under $10 they offer lunch specials that include dessert! I had the pad thai, which needed an oomph of something. I ended up using the spice rack more frequently than I was accustomed to. Presentation was simple and not memorable. The dessert that I had was a mini sized creme brulee, which was absolutely divine!   I knew I had to come back for dinner some time. On my most recent visit this is what I tried:   1) Pad Thai - Probably the best plated pad thai I have ever laid my eyes on. Wow. Noodles were encapsulated by a lattice style egg nest, topped with two large prawns, and accompanied with lime, peanuts, and bean sprouts on the side. No spice enhancement needed. Flavors were on point and very different from my lunch time experience.  2) Scallops in green curry - A deliciously light, but very filling and rich dish.  Scallops were on point and I enjoyed the veggies and all the flavors going on.  3) Mango sticky rice - So simple, but so good! The dessert chef at Arawan deserves recognition for the finesse and talent put into the dessert!   The interior is gorgeous and is perfect for an intimate dinner. Loved the ambience here and the warm, modern decor. The service was very polite and friendly.",

Both curries was amazing with the rice.   but the BEST part was the dessert. We had the mango island, Thai pancake, and coconut icecream. Definitely get the mango island because it has a combination of warm sticky rice and cold icecream. A creamy custard of happiness.   10/10 would recommend!!",

Their food has great presentation, is very flavorful and the staff is also very friendly. You can also taste the quality of their meats. A beef drunken noodle comes with a plethora of thick slices of beef that are very tender and the portion of noodles will make you very full! I highly recommend this place!   For all of you asking yourself how this place compares with the epic and well-known Lotus of Siam, I would say that Lotus is just a bit better in terms of food flavor and presentation, but Lotus is also a little pricier than this place. To put it frankly, I go to Lotus of Siam maybe once or twice every 3 or 4 months. I've been to Arawan 3 times this month! Happy eating!",

    "text": "Lovely small business restaurant. I love the decor and appreciate the attention to detail.   I have been there 3 different times during lunch and I find it to be consistently good food and decent service. There is a lunch special that includes soup, entree, and a dessert. The portions are generous, hot and delicious that I find the price very reasonable.   I enjoy ordering the blossoming tea because I think it is beautiful to watch.   The service is decent, you will often see the owner walking around and helping with service which I consider to be a mark of a well-run restaurant and an invested owner. From one small business to another, this ranks high in my book. There was only one time the waitress took far too long to bring my check which is crucial during lunch time when many are headed back to their offices or to the courthouses which are nearby.   We will be back for sure.",

    "text": "We took my mom here on Mother's Day. The restaurant is a little hard to find since the navigation guides you to the other side of the plaza - a pretty sketchy looking area - but it's definitely worth eating at.  The inside of the restaurant is nicely decorated and has a good ambiance. The food tasted AMAZING and used some unique ingredients and garnishes. For appetizers we ordered calamari and fresh spring rolls. We got the squid ink noodles, duck curry, and ribeye steak as entrees. For dessert we got the coconut treasure, creme brulee, and chocolate lava cake - all amazing as well. Overall, the whole experience was very good. Our server (Chinta?) was funny and attentive. The food had a great looking presentation and flavor.  The only negative comment I have is that the pricing is high for the portion size. The spring roll entree was one roll cut up into about 6 pieces. Each entree was ~$20+ and just enough for one person and a bite or two for someone else to try. I think if there was a bit more food I wouldn't mind frequenting this place more often instead of just for special occasions.",

The decor has that modern Thai look that I like.  Very clean, comfortable, great decor.  Service was very good.  They have the traditional menu items you expect, but also their versions -- The short rib yellow curry ($20 I think) got a good review at our table and my black ink pasta with seafood was really good ($24).  Presentation was beautiful.  Decent wine list-- simple, but some good, reasonable choices.  This is \"upscale\" Thai, but the prices are reasonable.  Flavors really good.  As I said, I was wondering a bit when I was walking over, but I was so glad I did as it really was the right break from the bustle of the convention and the strip.",

It is actually in the same strip mall as Lotus of Siam ^^    Stay inside the strip mall and keep driving around the parking lot to find the restaurant.  Inside the restaurant is nicer than the outward appearance.  Could not try a lot of the dishes since it was just two adults.   We ordered the catfish for our main.  The waitress was nice and actually advised not to order 2 entrees since the order would be huge.  She was right.  1 entree split between two and there was still leftovers at the end.  The Catfish was great.  Most catfish have a distinctive scent which I am not a fan of but this place cooked it just right.  Had calamari for appetizer and it was fine.  The green tea was awesome.  Just sad that we couldn't order more dishes.  If it was back home, we would have ordered just more and packed all the leftovers.",

Since we didn't want to wait, we decided to give this restaurant a try. When entering, it has a quiet atmosphere(it was not half filled) with excellent modern decorations and very clean.   As others have mentioned, the prices here are higher when compare to Komol. The presentations of the dishes are hands down beat both LotusOfSiam and Komol. I had a tom yum soup with shrimp and it was the best tasting tom yum soup I have had. Their spicy mint with ground pork was a bit on the sweet side and not spicy enough. This dish was just alright for me.  Their steam rice was a bit on the wet side. I would definitely come back to get the tom yum soup again and will try another entree. I would rate this place a 3.5 since i wasn't impressed with the spicy mint.",

My girlfriends and I were celebrating my birthday in Las Vegas and so happened to discover this little gem. Everything was excellent! The quality of the food was so good. My favorite was the papaya salad with salty eggs. I know...eggs! Yummy! Their desserts are to die for! Don't leave without ordering the desserts! Sticky rice with mango (not on menu, but they created for us), coconut ice cream, on and on! Everything was so good! We wanted to come back the next day, but time didn't allow us to. Please try this place! You won't regret it! Oh, did I mention the superb customer service! Yes! A must go! I'm coming back here when I return to Las Vegas!",

The prices are a little expensive during dinner, but an appetizer, one entree and dessert is definitely enough for you and date. Come during lunch for the special and you will get full off of the lunch special for a really good price. I recommend getting the Short Rib Yellow curry for your entree. The Mango Island for dessert is also very good.",

We saw 3 tables that sat dirty for over 25 minutes  while several groups waited to be seated (ourselves included). Once the tables were cleared amd the grouos were seated, we saw several other tables get up and leave. Those newly vacated tables sat dirty for at least 15 minutes before being cleared. The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because the food was quite tasty. I'm sure on a regular evening this olace would be great. But do not go to them when there is a large convention in town. You'll be sitting around a very long time.",

The host or owner not quite sure who he was ignored us as he spoke to a Thai customer for at least 2-3 minutes. When I said could we have a table for two, the man said \"You will have to wait\". He continued to speak to this other patron and not get us a table for another few minutes when we tried to flag down another member of the staff to seat us, he said \"do you have a reservation\"? We stated no and were a bit confused because the place looked about half full. After a brief moment of silence he sat us down.  The food was good however it took quite some time for us to actually get food and the waitress was non attentive. Needless to say, this will be the last time I will eat at this place because service seems to be an issue at least on the night we went.",

This is our favorite date place and we try to come at least 2 times a month. Highly recommend that you try the dessert! Special shout out to our waiter Luis. It was EDC weekend so of course it was super busy, but, judging by quality of his service, you would have never guessed it. He was cool, calm, collected, extremely attentive, friendly and even let us move to our \"usual table\" as soon as it cleared. (Talk about going above and beyond). It's staff like Luis that make this place so special. Also, the atmosphere is one of the best. Thanks Luis and everyone at Arawan. We'll see you soon!",

This turn out to be somewhat an expensive experiment that was a little disappointing. We really wanted Thai food but Lotus is temporarily closed so we went here. The Tom yum soup we ordered was really good when it is hot. We ordered it with medium spice and we weren't disappointed at first. However, as the soup got colder the flavor started to be really off. Also, there wasn't that many shrimps inside. The shrimps were good though and I like that they removed the tail. We also ordered our usual pad see ew and crying tiger. The pad see ew wasn't bad. Again, there wasn't enough meat and just like the tom yum soup. The crying tiger was okay. I usually order this item when I go to other Thai location so this one is in the middle of the pack. Unfortunately, my overall experience tells me to continue to go to Lotus of Siam. I cannot wait for it to return.",

The setting of the place is very modern and they create a mood like you're in a high-end restaurant. The chefs and managers are extremely friendly and well trained. They are attentive to their customers and it makes the customers feel welcomed.   Their drinks, including water, are all special. The Thai Iced Coffee was perfectly portioned between the coffee and the creme and came in a nice glass. Ice waters never felt so refreshing like the way they serve it. It comes with strawberries and mint. They leave a pitcher of water on the table as well and they often refill my glass for me as it gets half empty. They will also bring out a plate of Wonton Chips w/ Sweet n' Sour Sauce. The menu is doesn't offer too many dishes however they do perfect every dish that is on it. I had the Short Rib Daikon Soup and it had a strong celery taste and I absolutely loved it because it's a different soup to have on a Thai menu. The Thai Beef Salad w/ Fresh Mint was so amazing. When it came out, I didn't expect it to taste as good as it did. The beef was cooked just right and was extremely soft, almost like it could melt in my mouth. I would of like for there to be more lettuce and greens in it though. Also, the salad dressing is spicy so if you can't eat spicy, I wouldn't recommend it. I also tried the Crispy Lemongrass Catfish and I have to say, I was very impress on how well made the dish was. There the catfish was fried just right and the herbs, spices, and toppings made it perfect. It is accompanied with a sauce and mango slices. On top of the dish, there is also a few Lotus Chips (I wish they would give a bowl of Lotus Chips in the beginning). My favorite dish by far is the Pad Thai. We are talking about authentic Pad Thai. I have been waiting for a thai restaurant in Vegas to make Pad Thai the right way and Arawan has done it! Super excited and I will be coming back just for the Pad Thai. It also has a few large shrimps on top which looked and tasted amazing. They do not give steam rice so you will have to ask, but other than that, the dinner was amazing.   Now this restaurant also has their very own dessert chef who makes them right at the bar for you to see. Every dessert dish is made to order just like the dinner and that's what makes this place so special, they perfect everything from the drinks to entrees to the dessert. The Coconut Ice Cream was delicious however it was served with Young Coconut and Sticky Rice which I'm not too crazy about. Their Creme Brulee or Mango w/ Sticky Rice looked good too and I'll have to try them next time.  This place is well managed, the decor looks amazing, the dishes are perfectly made and I just hope that they will offer a larger menu in the future. I would like to see more rice dishes to eat family style, more vegetarian & vegan options, and more dishes that aren't spicy. They also have an area with unique seating in the back that is still being put together and it will make a nice seating area for parties. Great restaurant, I had an amazing dinning experience:D  On a funny note, my dad's only complaint for this place: \"why don't they have nicer napkins?\"",

The service is impeccable. The food is outstanding. Don't forget dessert!!! We don't usually order dessert, but it's worth both the extra expense and the calories here! Cheers!",

Although it's right next to Lotus, I've actually never been to Lotus so I won't be making any comparisons between the two. The interior space was relatively dark, but a very clean and modern space. I ordered a duck drunken noodles, one of my favorite Thai dishes, but I've never had it with duck before. I misread the menu and thought there was a lunch special at the time, but it's only for weekdays. The food didn't take too long to come out, and service was very good. The drunken noodles tasted great, but honestly, not the best drunken noodles I've ever had. In my opinion, the portion is a bit small for the price. It would've been a much better deal with the lunch special that comes with soup, salad and dessert. Trying one dish is not enough to judge the quality of the food here, and I definitely want to try their desserts next time. Will definitely come back again for more!",

And on top of it all, the food is fantastic! I love Pad Thai and will be coming here again and again. This is the good stuff.?",

I give one star for Portion size and pricing. I got soup, an entrees and small side salad, and a small dessert on lunch for just ten dollars. I couldn't finish it all. I give one star for service, as the Staff were all very attentive and timely.  I also give one star for taste, as the food was all delightful.  The soup was light, my entree was chicken pahd see ew, medium spice.  It was mild for spicy, making it easier to differentiate between the light flavors.  Lastly, the mango ice cream was just the right amount, a light melon baller size with a frozen mint leaf garnish.  I enjoyed my solo lunch very much!",

Only thing I would change is to order it thai-hot since I love spicey food.  Even though the lunch came with a very good dessert, I couldn't resist also ordering the creme brulet and banana Thai pancakes.  Omg, the creme brulet has a beautiful caramel lattice protecting it and the Thai pancakes tasted amazing.  Not too sweet, just right.  Check this place out next time you're in Vegas!",

    "text": "If you're a savvy tourist or an in-the-know local, off-strip Vegas dining is where the real action is for price-point, innovation, and community.  And the questions we had for our dinner at Arawan were: 1) would the food be as good or better than other well-known Thai restaurants and 2) was it the sort of experience that could be easily duplicated elsewhere?  For our party of two, the answers were 1) YES and 2) NO.  Here's why.  Everything that's already been said is True.  The interior is beautiful, peaceful, and thought-out.  It's not gaudy, it doesn't bump loud music, and there isn't some attempt to make it seem as if you're in the middle of a billion dollar casino.  It makes you feel like you're in a really nice restaurant where people cared about your experience when they decorated and designed it.  Is the service great? YES.  This was the sort of service that you often crave and wonder why others can't duplicate.  The entire team made a point to stop by the table, offer answers to various questions, and then to chat after the meal to ensure that it was well received.  It felt like the entire team truly wanted to make sure we left happy.  Was the food as pretty and tasty and original as others have said?  Yes, and there's not much to add there.  The only critique is that it's definitely not the place that you go if you want a high-energy dinner filled with a trend-setting LED panel display behind an in-house \"dining dj\", bustier-wearing waiter, and a $80 filet with $10 sauce.   But, if you want quality off-strip food in downtown Las Vegas, could you find another place with this serene environment, focus on diner happiness, and with absolutely gorgeous plating and food?  NO.  And that's why we'll be back soon to Arawan Thai.",

I like other diners was turned off by the wait time at Lotus, so wandered over to this restaurant instead. So glad we did, completely blown away by this place. The decor and ambience are perfect, not too snooty but relaxing. The staff are super attentive without being in your face all the time. We were easily seated and waited on within minutes. Now for the good stuff, I simply can not say enough about their food. From the appetizers down to the freshly hand made desserts, everything was perfect. The presentation is beautiful, what I would expect from a 5 star strip restaurant, but the price is very reasonable. We had a selection of appetizers, simply delicious. Followed by Panang beef, Squid ink drunken noodles and Shrimp spicy green beans. Finished up with the hands down best creme brulee I have ever had, plus Mango sticky rice. Well done Arawan, keep up the good work.",

The birthday girl requested Thai and yelpers seemed to like Arawan. We had been to Lotus of Siam a couple of times and loved it, but thought the the menu at Arawan might be better for our group encompassing12 people and three generations ranging from 6-83. Arawan not only did not disappoint, it surpassed all of our expectations and set a new bar for dessert, something Thai restaurants are not generally known for. The food was complex, with flavors that were both distinguishable and in harmony, and the presentation beautiful. Some dishes hit different parts of your tongue at different time. Kay provided excellent service and made sure some things were spicy and other things were not.  What we ordered. Chicken wings and ahi larb were the favorite starters. We liked the larb so much we ordered a second one--great combination of kaffir lime leaves, lemongrass, shallots, and fish sauce. Soup was excellent--we asked for more bowls so everyone could try. For entrees we had the fried catfish, impressive presentation and delicious; rib eye crispy basil, wonderful cut of meat artfully prepared; soft shell crab pad pong Karee, one of them the best Thai seafood dishes I have ever tried; scallop green curry, which was yummy; yellow chicken curry, more complex than the usual; pad Thai, the only thing I did not love; chow men, which the younger kids loved (and even the chow mien detractors enjoyed).  As is typical in Thai restaurants especially with large parties like ours, the food came out hot and delicious when it was ready, some dishes sooner than others--this is normal in a good Thai restaurants, which often don't use hot lights. It makes for better tasting food and we recommend eating family style, which also gives everyone a chance to try everything.  Now for the desserts--which were innovative and some of the most amazing we have had anywhere. Five star restaurant worthy. With 12 people we ordered one of almost everything. The stand outs included Mango Island, which combined Mango gelato, passion fruit creme, sticky rice, crispy brittle, and a light coconut sauce to transform the traditional mango sticky rice into a light, complex \"symphony of textures and flavors\" as advertised. Earthquake, a dark chocolate sphere containing lychee ice cream with raspberry sauce, was amazing and innovative--we did not think we liked lychee--we were wrong! Raspberry, chocolate lava cake oozed amazing raspberry sauce and was to die for. Our birthday girl was almost licking the plates. We also liked the affogato, banana puff, and some kind of Thai pancake with Thai tea ice cream. We cannot stress enough--eat dessert it is worth every penny.  We had a little trouble with reservations due to language issues, which Kay figured out and resolved for us and we are so glad she did. This restaurant is not easy to find. It is in a funky retail center. All the tenants have the same address--Arawan is in block E. I can't remember the suite number, but the location seems correct on apple maps. It is worth the finding and the trip. Highly recommend.",

The decor inside was very authentic looking, clean and nicely placed. The staff was very friendly and accommodating for our large party. We went here for a lunch meeting, so we had the added benefit of a lunch specials menu, which I recommend since the portions are a good size and there's a good selection to choose from.  I ended up having some fried wontons which were the usual. Quite a few pieces for sharing paired with sweet and sour sauce. For my meal I got the Pad See Ew. This is where my experience went downhill. The Pad See Ew was straight up awful. This is one of my favorite Thai dishes so I do have it frequently. The sauce was off, the chicken was not good quality at all, and the food was cold when it was placed in front of me. As I was with a large group of co workers and staff, I didn't complain or say anything but wow, not a good look on their part.  Instead of saying don't go, I'll say watch what you order, don't order the Pad See Ew, or go with a large group. All of our food was brought out at different times which is rude to the rest of the group. And then the icing on the cake was when our vegetarian coworker was given the chicken curry instead of the vegan curry and started to eat it before realizing it was the wrong one. What kind of service is that?? They barely apologized for this mistake and lucky for them my coworker is nice so she said nothing, but I thought that was ridiculous. Overall not a really great experience and I will take my friends elsewhere for awesome thai food.",

    "text": "I get it, I really do.  A lot of people really like Thai food that isn't very spicy, or isn't overly herbed, or, well, isn't Thai food.  If that describes your Western palate, then this new Thai restaurant is definitely worth a visit.  The inside decor is beautiful and makes you feel like you're eating at a fine dining restaurant (and indeed you are), with light jazz music and fancy seating.  It's small, intimate, the wait staff is professional, and a great place for a date night.    I should have known where this restaurant's style was going to go when I noticed the lack of Thai spice racks throughout the small space, and the overly simplified, one-page menu.  Ah yes, it's one of \"those\" Thai restaurants!    I ordered the Tom Kha Kai, small bowl at $6, and the beef short rib yellow curry at $15.  The beef short rib curry was a cheaper item on the menu, and seemed like a safe and popular dish to try.  As per heat warnings in at least one review, I ordered everything at a \"medium\".  Ha!  The Tom Kha was fairly well done, but in the end rather bland.  Very light coconut and lime, with little in the way of spices.  Cherry tomatoes were a nice touch.  The chunks of chicken breast were nice and tender.  My curry came out before I got even half way through it though, and I didn't feel inclined to finish it.  Just a bit boring for my taste.  The curry was along the same lines.  I always find it funny when Thai servers put the main course in front of you, an empty plate behind that, and a small bowl of rice off to the side somewhere.  I call it, \"I give up, you figure it out, white guy.\"  Service always gets a little more attentive when I rearrange everything, put the rice on my plate, scoop the main course onto the rice, and ask for a spoon.  \"Oh, this white guy knows how to eat Thai food!\" becomes the server's new mantra.  The curry was pretty decent.  It had a sort of Indian or perhaps Malaysian style to it as far as the herbs.  Definitely different than authentic Thai curry (Bangcock or otherwise), unless maybe it's a Lao style.  In any case, it wasn't spicy hot at all (\"medium\" = \"I am curious, but please don't hurt me!\").  The flavor, other than those \"Indian\" herbs, was a little bit bland.  The beef short rib was the saving grace of the entire meal though.  It was nothing short of delightful.  It was served with a big chunk of flesh upon a bone with yet more flesh to be scraped, chewed, clawed, etc.  Lots of fat, tender and juicy.  This was worth the price point for sure.  I just wished the curry itself was a little better to go with it.    I understand the fuss and great reviews.  This is a nice, comfortable, upscale-feeling restaurant with a great, friendly staff.  The food is upscale for sure.  Don't make any mistake though, this isn't close to being authentic even in an Americanized Thai restaurant kind of way.  The flavors aren't going to challenge your palate, but if you are used to real Thai food they aren't going to interest you either.  This one is making my \"Overrated\" and \"Gringos\" Thai lists.",

We went for lunch and I must say its the best Thai food I've ever eaten. Everything was delicious! Lunch specials were $10 served with egg drop soup, jasmine flower tea, then your entree which included a salad, rice and then dessert. Everything was flavorful, fresh and nicely presented. The ambiance is delightful right down to the music and service is excellent.  I will eat here anytime I'm in Vegas. Highly recommend it and there's plenty of parking too.",

Looks like it's time to add another to that stellar list, Arawan excels in every possible way. The dining room is classy and quaint. The flavors are on point and presentation is modern and upscale. The service is friendly and attentive. Do yourself a favor and visit Arawan immediately, you won't be disappointed.",

Water was also fresh tasting with a strawberry added on the bottom for a unique flavor.  I will definitely be back to try the fabulous looking Pad Thai dish, and now consider this place my favorite Thai spot.",

IF you like spicy, you need to tell them you want thai hot as it is not as spicy as other local thai restaurants.  Decor is beautiful, service is top notch. Amazing desserts. Menu is expanding and they will add liquor soon hopefully.  I rate on par with Chada Thai but give a nod to Chada Thai on some food items.  Service and dessert go to Arawan; no contest.  They have interesting side room that was part of former Japanese restaurant.  This is my new go to place for clients or a great lunch.",

The service is amazing and the owner is so friendly and caring. The creme brulee is beyond delicious!! It's perfectly torched and the custard is just the right consistency. My boyfriend ordered the curry and love it! He's very picky when it comes to his curry and he was loved it. I have been to this restaurant a total of 4 times and I have never been disappointed.

We ate here twice in three days, savoring every dish that we tried: ago tuna larb (a first for us), curried fish cakes, short rib curry, chicken curry, pad Thai, drunken noodles (rich with vegetables!), egg drop soup, Thai iced tea, and Oreo cheesecake (delicately light). Loved every bite! Service was very efficient and pleasant. One of the servers, named Apple, recommended the drunken noodles as her favorite and it is possible that no other drunken noodle will ever live up to this standard. My husband is now determined to duplicate the yellow curry at home.",

In at 5:30 no problem. Prompt and happy, very accommodating and hospitable service. The food was outstanding. Had a Satay chicken app, drunken noodles and a tasty Thai beer Singha. Creme brulee for dessert was unreal. Shady part of town - we're at first concerned about our safety. The strip mall is pretty scary. But it was like walking into an oasis. Very happy. 4 stars for location and lack of liquor. Short Beer menu (4) and lots of wines.",

It was SO good.   The staff were super friendly and helpful and it was nice that they checked in to see how I liked everything.    Get off the strip and go to this place. It's a little hard to find because it's off the street in the middle of a strip mall stand alone building. But you will be so happy you found it. So, so good. And whatever you do, save room for dessert. I had the Mango something and it was one of the best desserts I'd ever had.   I hardly ever give a 5 star rating. But this place earned it. Excellent!",

It doesn't look like much on the outside, but everything is first class once you step through the door.  Not only were the dishes bursting with flavor, they were gorgeously presented with details worthy of being in any of the high end restaurants around here. We had the soft shell crab, rib eye, squid ink, egg papaya salad, and tom yum soup. Each dish was a hit with our group of five picky foodies. What really blew us away were the desserts. Not your typical Thai desserts. The quality is on another level. The coconut dessert was perfect with bits of peanuts, tender coconut flesh, and sweet sticky rice underneath. Order the creme brulee and it'll come out with enough flair to warrant a photo or two. Of course, it'll taste as good as it looks. The manager Gail stopped by and we learned that she is a pastry chef. Totally shows in the food.",

They start with the traditional wontons, something I've never cared for. But these were awesome. They were enormous and actually fresh. We first ordered the Arawan fresh spring roll, a must. They are made with beautiful vegetables and the dipping sauce is amazing. Next came the Beef & Mint Salad-the best I've had. I only wish it came with the usual sticky rice to sop up the vinaigrette. It was my favorite dish of the night. Finally we ordered the Green Curry, also delicious. I wish we had the room & time for dessert. We will certainly be back! Thank you Arawan.",

Looked up the reviews on Yelp! and decided that we had to try this place soon...and what a great decision that ended up being!  Ordered- - Thai Lemongrass Chicken Wings ($8) - Chicken Pad See Ew ($12) - Thai BBQ Chicken ($12) - Tom Yum Goong Nam Khon ($7)  Thai Lemongrass Chicken Wings (3.5/5) Very unique tasting wings. Meat was extremely juicy and tender and took zero effort to pull from the bone! Even though it indicates Lemongrass in the title, the flavor reminded me more of the flavor of the tom yum. Very good wings!  Chicken Pad See Ew (5/5) Incredibly tasty and flavorful chicken pad see ew. The chicken was cooked to perfection! I thought Lotus had a mighty fine version of this dish, but Arawans was flawless! Perfect blend of sweet and salty!  Thai BBQ Chicken (5/5) Very generous portion of BBQ chicken! Also cooked superbly, the meat was so tender and juicy as well!   Tom Yum Goong Nam Khon (5/5) Wow. Best Tom Yum I have <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fever.had.in.my.life&s=ac4af3b96a5ea10e140ca4d0b33d629a026773d60cfaa3fd82303cae787d1aa5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ever.had.in.my.life</a>! I am in love! Seriously. The soup base for the tom yum is about as authentic as you are going to find outside of Thailand itself! The spice level was on point and there were plenty of large shrimp within the soup. Sheer gratification!  Service (10/5) Easily some of the best service I have ever experienced at a restaurant of any kind in my life! Our server, Tanya, was so friendly and sweet and personable! We actually were waited on by at least 4 different employees at some point and all were incredible! Our drinks never reached even the halfway point before being refilled!   What I find most impressive about all of this is the fact that they use NO MSG in any of their food! To have this kind of flavor in Asian food with zero MSG really speaks to the skill and expertise of the cooks here!   - Side note: I love how the glasses of ice water come with a 1/2 strawberry! It is the unique little details that stand out in Arawans presentation!  This was a fantastic dining experience and we are already planning a return visit to try other menu items!I can't even begin to recommend this place highly enough!  5 stars.  Woohoo! As good as it gets!",

    "text": "Arawan Thai Bistro is an awesome restaurant. They have feature traditional flavor profiles enhanced by their unique presentation style.  Their flavor profiles are spot on Thai enhanced with creative plating. For example we had their shrimp pad thai which features a net made from egg. The net holds the noodles together in a package. Most pad thai chefs just mix an egg in willy nilly. Not Arawan, they had to go and make a net package out of the egg. (See photo). I have never seen that before. So delicious  and inventive. Their pad that is a perfect balance of flavors; tamarind, fish sauce and coconut sugar. Get it as spicy as you want or mild. We also loved their crab fried rice. It it pressed into a cylinder shaped mountain of crabby goodness, shot through and through with big chunks of fresh crab. Light, and not greasy like most fried rice.  We also enjoyed their Thai iced tea with our dinner.  Arawan also features an extensive desert menu with lots of unique creations. The staff is super friendly and attentive, our water glasses were always topped off and our server checked on us frequently. Park for free in the adjoining lot. Overall, highly recommend.",

    "text": "Very nicely decorated intimate interior with a wide selection of menu items. Decided on the calamari, papaya salad, short rib yellow curry and thai spiced sea bass. Had an awesome experience here but knocked one star off because of the prices.   Calamari was deliciously crispy and not oily. The dipping sauce was the best part which was tangy and spicy but not too overwhelming. Gotta say one of my fave calamari now.  The papaya salad was a little more bland than other places. I couldn't really detect any vinegary or fishy taste which most other papaya salads usually have. Probably wouldn't order this dish again.   The short rib yellow curry was awesome. Perfectly tender and seasoned and it was perfectly sized to share between two people. And it came with the perfect amount of carrots and potatoes. The curry wasn't too overwhelming spiced which I liked. Definitely a must order.   I wasn't disappointed by the sea bass either. The skin was crisply fried and remained crispy even after being layered with a chili sauce which wasn't too sweet or spicy.   My favorite part was the dessert. Ordered the Sweet Sensation which came with thai tea ice cream which was awesome and not overly sweet. The pancake portion of it was delicious and simple and fluffy and buttery. Will order again.",

    "text": "We were craving Thai after spending time in the culinary wasteland of southwest Utah. There are many Thai places with good reviews in Vegas, but we decided on this one. It was one of the best Thai meals I've ever had! The complimentary crispy wontons and sweet and spicy dipping sauce were a nice touch and judging by the yumminess of the sauce, I knew we were in for a good meal. Got the ahi tuna larb as an appetizer and it was very flavorful with good sour notes. For my entree I had drunken noodles with crispy pork. The pork was delicious, as were the noodles. Wonderful flavor! Sadly we didn't have room for dessert, but our server advised us that they are known for their dessert.",

The service was excellent and the menu was very clear. What a great idea to put a piece of strawberry in your water! It looks so pretty and tastes so good! Usually my bf orders for me in Asian places because I am not very familiar with this cuisine but this time I decided to order myself. I am a big fan of duck dishes which are a staple in France and they are usually cooked in sauce. So in my opinion the duck I ordered was a little bit dry, but maybe that's the way they cook it in Thailand. We will be back very soon and I want to try something else.",

They pay so much attention to the details of each dish that even the most common Thai dishes have been elevated here. There wasn't anything that I could find wrong with the food or exceptionally friendly service. While waiting for our food, I stayed fascinated by watching them intricately assemble the dessert for a nearby table. We wanted to save room for that but everything was so good that we just wiggled the food down and ordered the dessert anyway. It was worth every penny! The mango sorbet on top of the warm fluffy sticky rice and creamy coconut milk with surprising extra tidbids like cookies and almonds was a pretty orgasmic experience. I hope they somehow expand this quality local to me area someday but for now it's on top of my food list for Vegas",

After reading reviews on Arawan I decided to give it a try and has to stop by ever since.   I've ordered the curry short rib, squid ink noodle, green curry scallop and calamari. Dessert I ordered the creme brulee and the vanilla ice cream with espresso shot(forgot the name).   They gave us complementary chips and dip. It was sweet, tangy and mild spicy. Calamari was soft and lightly battered with a kick of spice.   Short ribs were very tender and flavorful, sauce was a perfect consistently, not too runny or thick.   Squid ink noodles had a nice chew to the noodles, good amount of seafood and not too salty.   Green curry scallops were perfectly cooked, and I really like the strong Thai spices. I had a glass of sauvignon blanc (forgot the name) and it worked really well with the scallops.   Creme brulee was very pretty, the sugar net shell was a little hard to eat, but the rest was very rich and a perfect portion.   Vanilla bean ice cream with espresso shot could of made the cut of the ice cream was creamier, it tasted like it sat in the fridge for a period of time... biscotti was just ok. Taste overall was 4/5  I have to really talk about the service. They are so humble, and I made a call to reserve a table and they were really kind and asked if it was for a special occasion like birthday or anniversary. They thanked me for coming back every time and the smile and the way they serve is above and beyond. I will be coming back AGAIN! AND they have more desserts now because they have a new person creating new dessert. When receiving the desserts he/she would explain what's in front of you. Arawan haven't disappointed me.",

The prime rib in the  yellow curry was extremely chewy, can't even cut with the knife, it needs to be cooked for at least another 3 hrs,  the black ink drunken noodle was tasteless,  with pieces of very chewy octopus,  battered fishes,  and undercooked beans,  the taste is blah and the combinations seafood items were just place on top of the black ink noodles,  with no flavor at all tied together!  I'm surprised to see so many stars !!  Definitely not for the food.  Definitely will not return,  too bad it's so close to my place!!!",

Points here because I remember thinking to myself, \"MAN! We picked the perfect place!\"  Well...that didn't last long. The restaurant was relatively quiet. Very comfortable enviroment. The servers were also very well verse and knowledgeable about the menu. The reason why I'm rating this place 3 stars was because it took them 1.5 hours to get our food out. Not only that but the servers were consistently over promising that the good should be out any minute but it wasnt. They also forgot 2 of our orders.   Sweet thing was they gave us a complimentary dessert for my birthday girl and also sang a song.   Probably wont come back. The food was okay nothing extraordinary.",

They tried to service us with just one waiter, but you know it was very difficult. There were 2 or 3 patrons in the restaurant so it wasn't busy.  The food was mediocre and there was a strand of hair in one of our dishes. The good thing is that we had our own private room for our party which was nice. The owner failed to come by and apologize for the confusion. We paid  over $650 with gratuity of 18% included. Oh well. I just hope my mom had a great birthday despite the mishap.",

Our young waiter approached our table almost immediately after our seating. We eventually settled on a Thai iced tea, regular iced tea, two appetizers, a veggie spring roll and the other a breaded fried shrimp plate that included a small but beautiful and delicious salad. For our main entrees, we had the Black squid ink drunken noodles with assorted seafood and the husband had the duck soup noodles. OMG, both were really tasty, good portions, the noodles chewy yet firm, their sauces served with all dishes mentioned each different and enhanced each item. A lot of seafood and duck meat. A lovely place with good service, friendly calm atmosphere and of course excellent food!!!",

Not much to say as this spot has been reviewed hundreds of times, and the place stands the test of time as a local haunt. Classic Vegas dinning experience awaits you when you arrive; great waiters, low key, contemporary space, great drinks and food.  Recommend trying the Arawan Pad Thai as it looks so good, you don't even want to eat it. Nice big prawns, really great spicy noodles that are wrapped in some type of egg based which is phenomenal. Also had the duck noodle soup which was excellent, loved the broth.  Could have that same meal any day of the week, can't wait to go back.  Really cool spot for a date night imo.",

We were a large group of coworkers in for dinner and the team at Arawan made it a memorable night.  We started with appetizers: Fish patties - good Papaya salad - best I've ever had. Fresh, crunchy and perfectly spicy.  Chicken satay - very good but the highlight was the peanut butter sauce. I've had many but theirs is delicious Main course - yellow curry level 7 heat - this dish was cooked to perfection and I have to say the best Thai curry that I've ever had. Each bite was better and had so much flavor. I could have drank the broth as my drink it was so good! Dessert- Mango pancake with Thai tea ice cream - so unique and just to look at it made me happy  The food is out of this world. The service and presentation is the icing on the cake.  Pricing is reasonable and menu is extensive, stop in you will not regret!",

    "text": "\"HOLE-IN-THE-WALL\"  Don't let the location fool you, this Thai restaurant is sophisticated, elegant, and cheap.   FOOD: My friend and I were craving Thai food and this restaurant was the closest to us. We didn't do any research or read any reviews. We just wanted a quick bite. WE WERE WRONG. This place is fancy and the food is amazing. We played it safe and ordered off the $9.95 lunch menu, which includes soup, a generous portion of noodle or rice dish, and dessert.  Lunch started off with a chicken noodle soup. It featured a rich chicken broth, juicy chicken slices, and wide rice noodles. The broth wasn't the yellow chicken powder or stock... it was a dark brown flavorful but not too salty soup.   I ordered the drunken noodles and my friend ordered a pad Thai. The classic pad Thai featured stir fried medium size rice noodles with egg, bean sprouts topped with ground peanuts -- generous portion, chewy noodles, perfect amount of sweet, salty, and sour seasoning. The drunken noodle featured stir fried with salt noodle, green & white onions, fresh Thai basil, fresh green peppercorns, mushrooms, and a delicate sweet-spicy chili sauce -- also generous portion with an amazing spice kick from the peppercorn.   Finally lunch ended with desert, a creamy blueberry cheesecake slice.   AMBIANCE: Sketchy neighbored (I'm not gonna lie ). You think it would be a mom and pop type restaurant based on the other restaurants nearby, but don't let this this modern restaurant fool you. I walked into a fancy restaurant (it reminded me of an Omakase sushi restaurant), with French music playing (during lunchtime), and patio type chairs. I was confused with what they were trying to accomplish but overall I was blown away.   OVERALL: I was so impressed with their lunch special that I will 100% come back to this side of town for dinner. If you are ever in the neighborhood, I highly recommend the 3-course lunch special. I can't wait to come back to try the curries, salads, other noodle dishes, and desserts.",

Outside surrounding the restaurant is a run down area, with lots of other businesses and plenty of sketchy looking people walking around.  Walking into this restaurant you will see a beautiful interior, with tables and some bar seating.  The service, excellent.  The food, amazing.  Overall a perfect experience for the two of us.  The perfect ambiance for a date.  We ordered the Rib Eye Numtok and the Arawan Pad Thai.  Both dishes came out photo worthy and were so tasty!  The Rib Eye Numtok was ordered with medium spice, and was very flavorful.  None of the ingredients overpowered another.  It comes with lettuce but I'm sure it would be delicious paired with some rice as well.  The Arawan Pad Thai.. now that dish is something.  A bunch of noodles with egg lace and 2 prawns on top.  This dish was the star of dinner, bursting with flavor that made me want more.  We'll be back to try the dessert next time!",

Squid Ink drunken noodle: $26     This is a high end version of drunken noodle. Love this squid ink sooooo much!  3.

Soft shell crab salad: $19     The salad was not that special, but the soft shell crab was very large and crispy! So we ordered extra  2, we cannot get enough of the crabs!   5. Mango paradise: $10     This is also another high end version of mango sticky rice. With very fresh mangoes and two kind of sticky rice.   6. Fried soft shell crab for 2: $10      The server knew we were celebrating our anniversary in Las Vegas, she offered us a free dessert----strawberry ice cream with fresh strawberries. Very yummy and so sweet of this restaurant! Will totally come back when we are in Vegas next time!",

Flavor profiles were complicated and amazing. We ordered the pineapple fried rice and was probably the best fried rice I've ever tasted. Even the lemonade was delicious - a perfect combination of sweet and sour.   The last surprise was a special dessert they brought for my husband. I asked if they did anything when I booked the reservation. I couldn't have asked for anything better. Thanks so much and we will definitely be back!  My stomach is happy.",

We got the rib eye nam tok / short rib yellow curry / crab fried rice / Tom yum shrimp.    The rib eye nam tok : the beef was boiled .. not grilled or even pan fried. That was prolly one of the bad thing you can do for the meat.  The salad itself was tasty bc of the seasoning .  But the boiled meat ruined it .   The short rib yellow curry : literally more like curry soup and it was sweet and not flavorful. They only give you one short rib. Also a rip off !!  The crab fried rice .  Nothing special ..   Tom yum shrimp soup .. I thought it was $11 for a small.. but when the bill came it was $12.  I mean it's not much of  a difference but it should have been clearly listed.    I'm not sure if there are any good Thai good in Las Vegas anymore .  The other competitive one also went down the drain when they moved to their newest location",

    "text": "Came here with some old coworkers and former boss for a going away lunch for one of my old coworkers. The restaurant sits in the middle building of commercial center, where the popular Lotus of Siam used to be near. I'd call this another \"hidden gem\" in an area you'd never think to have good food. I was told Arawan took over the spot where Tokyo Japanese Restaurant used to be. Renovations had changed the interior to a more up-scale, borderline almost fine dining style Thai restaurant with their logo to the back wall of the restaurant. I had felt mildly underdressed when walking into this restaurant, but oh well. Lol   The table we sat at was a bar height table w/ stools. On the side with 2 chairs, it seemed mildly \"squished\" as the width was perfect for the chairs, and chairs only. lol  My former boss had been here before so i let her do all the ordering for the table. Everyone was served water with a piece of strawberry in it. Wouldn't exactly say strawberry infused water, just more of like a decoration. Lol   Complimentary crispy wonton skins with a chili-lime sauce   Simple wonton skins fried and a chili lime sauce on the side that adds a nice punch to the \"fried\" aspect of the wonton skins  \"Egg Papaya Salad\" - Shrimp, salted egg, green papaya, tomatoes, crisp green beans, crushed almonds, thai pork sausage, pork rind and spicy-sweetnam-pla chili-lime dressing  Very bright green papaya salad w/ tomatoes, green beans, almonds w/ a chili-lime dressing w/ a mountain of fried pork skin/rind/chicharons that was yummy to dip in the dressing. Always a favorite of mine to get papaya salad at thai restaurants   \"Ahi Tuna Larb\" - Ahi tuna tossed in a spicy lime dressing with rice powder, mango, avocado, shallot, green onion, carrot, and cilantro-served w/ crispy wontons  Larb is typically known as a meat dish w/ chili, mint, veggies and some sort of sour aspect (lime or another souring agent). In this case, it was fresh, raw ahi tuna tossed in a spicy lime dressing w/ mango, avocado, shallots, carrots served w/ crispy wonton and \"cups\" made with iceberg lettuce. In a way its like a lettuce wrap, but not. The spicy lime dressing and mango brightens the flavor of the tuna w/ added sweetness and crunch from shallots and carrots making a yummy appetizer to have.   \"Plum Shrimp\" - Crispy egg noodle-wrapped jumbo shrimp w/ side of orange plum sauce  Overall pretty yummy. Would have preferred a little less amount of egg-noodles wrapped around. Kind of \"masks\" the shrimp but the orange plum sauce adds a nice flavor overall to the crispy noodles.   \"Crab Fried Rice\" - Crab meat stir-fried w/ rice, egg, tomato, and onion  A \"simple\" but delicate fried rice w/ fresh crab meat, egg, cherry tomatoes, and onion. The crab and egg was perfectly cooked so the both egg and crab was not dry and tough.   \"Crispy Duck\" - Crispy-fried marinated duck in five spices served w/ house lime-chili sauce  The duck itself was mildly dry but flavorful overall. I think they removed most/all the bones besides the \"drumstick\" making it for easy eating.   \"Tenderloin Black Pepper\" - Beef tenderloin topped with black pepper sauce, garlic, green onion, white onion, bell pepper, and pepper-corn  Super tender beef tenderloin w/ a rich black pepper sauce with tons of veggies and fresh green peppercorns. Not so much of a fan of the veggies but this was my first time having fresh green peppercorns. They were surprisingly not spicy, doesn't pack a punch, but mildly sweet in flavor too along with the pepper taste. Tenderloin w/ black pepper sauce and fresh green peppercorns on a plate of rice, and id be happy any day !   \"Crispy Lemongrass Catfish\" - Whole catfish crispy-fried and topped w/ lemongrass, fresh mint, mango, red onion, garlic, cashew nuts, tomatoes, green onion, cilantro, crispy basil served with homemade green apple semi-spicy dressing  The \"main event\" of the lunch was a WHOLE catfish fried to perfection topped with many items. The skin was perfectly crispy, even the OTHER side after we had removed and ate all the meat from one half of the fish. The green apple semi-spicy dressing adds a great bright flavor on top of all of the fresh toppings that was on the fish as well.   Unfortunately, the pastry chef was not in the restaurant and had \"just stepped out\" according to our waiter, so we were not able to order any desserts. Other tables seemed to have been given ice cream or sliver's of cake but we were not given anything. Not sure if this is a normal occurrence at this restaurant or what the reason was. Maybe only available if you order lunch special? I don't know. There was a dessert my former boss really wanted us to try but unfortunately, we couldn't.   Overall, the lunch was really good. Flavor of everything was fairly on point. Though for a party of 5, it was pretty pricey but i guess for the quality in ingredients used, it was really good.   Service was pretty good. They kept my water glass filled and never completely empty.",

    "text": "So I got a recommendation from my professor about going here if I ever was craving some good Thai food. My friends and I went here Friday afternoon for lunch and we were all pleased. Its located in a very opened area plaza, looks a little dead and weird at first though. It was also a bit hard for us to find it, but thanks to yelp we saw pictures of the outside and were on the look out for the red roof building.   So we went in and decided to all get something from their lunch menu. The lunch menu gave sufficient enough portions to satisfy our appetite. For about $10, you get their soup of the day (it changes each day), a choice of entree from their lunch menu (they have a variety), and then Thai Tea Ice Cream for dessert! Also if you check in on Yelp, you get a free Thai Iced Coffee! The coffee was very good, a definite must get & plus it's free, so why not?? So all that for just $10 is a great deal for lunch! Also, they're so fancy to the point where they put a slice of strawberry in your water! Really, the whole restaurant was very fancy. Very nice interior and decor, the staff were very friendly and attentive asking how we were doing or if we needed anything else. I really like that when it comes to customer service.   Onto the food. So I ordered their yellow curry and my choice of protein was beef. When mine was brought out it was very nicely plated. The curry was flavored well, thick, and with a good amount of beef and veggies. It also came with a portion of rice as well so eating it all definitely filled me up! The soup of the day we got was Chicken Tom Yum! Mmmm! My favorite! The broth wasn't too spicy, sweet or tangy. It was very aromatic and flavorful and definitely a good appetizer before the main entree came out. Finally, dessert time! The ice cream was creamy and you could definitely tell there was True thai tea flavor in it. Not too sweet with their ice cream too. A great ending to a delicious Thai lunch.",

    "text": "I left a very large stainless steel water bottle here last night. I called the next day to confirm it was in safe keeping before going to retrieve it, & the gentleman said he didn't find anything. WOW! So your staff are thieves, then? Real nice. And YES I KNOW it was there because I went straight home afterwards & it wasn't in my car. You may think, \"why would anyone steal your water bottle??\" I have 2 guesses. 1) it's a very nice, expensive water bottle. OR 2) the greedy server wasn't satisfied with my 20% tip & stole it \"just because\". Either way - WRONG.  As for the food & service: Despite being served by 4 different servers & only getting one refill the entire meal, it was still ok food. Nothing spectacular, but it's good. If you're a sucker for ambiance opposed to QUALITY OF FOOD I say go for it. If you pay no mind to filthy bathrooms, unsanitary conditions & you're ok paying more for the \"presentation\" & \"facade\", then I say GO FOR IT! LOL But if you'd rather save a few bucks & get the SAME quality food, I'm happy to offer some other, better suggestions.  I don't recommend substituting the arawan shrimp roll for a veggie roll, they will rip you off BIG TIME. I wish I snapped a pic of how pathetic this $8 roll looked. And it was NOT FRESH BTW. Literally NOTHING like the size on the menu. They also give you this bomb-a** sauce with about 4 tiny fried chips as your appetizer. The sauce is great but um, WHHHY do they give 4 pieces of nothing to eat it with??? LOL Give us spring rolls instead! The water tasted odd but my chow mein & tom kha was delic' (at $10 for a TINY BOWL!) I was like \"did I order some tom kha or did I order a french onion soup?!\" LOL You can get a soup that feeds 2-3 people for $2 more at MOST thai places! C'mon people!! My bf also liked his pineapple fried rice.  I actually brought him here for a New Years treat because I thought this was a more \"high end\" thai place. But once we got our appetizer, I knew it was more about the facade & hype. As for us - we will not be giving them another dime since they obviously think it's ok to steal private property from their paying customers. As for the management at Arawan - WAY TO GO hiring dishonest, thieving employees!",

    "text": "Arawan is a Thai restaurant located in the same strip mall as the original Lotus of Siam restaurant(my favorite Thai restaurant in the States). It was a spontaneous lunch date since I was pressed for time for my flight back to LA.   The restaurant was actually larger than what I expected. It was nicely decorated and the chairs were super comfortable. It was simple, yet elegant.   The menu itself was large but not overwhelming. There was a variety of the usual dishes to choose from, i.e. noodles, soup, curries and rice dishes. I wanted to stick with their most popular dishes.  Larb ($14.00): Ground chicken tossed in spicy lime dressing with rice powder, red onion, green onion and cilantro-served with lettuce. The larb was actually quite tasty. We asked for mild and it was the perfect level of spice. I  thought it was refreshing since the lime cut through the heaviness of the dish.    KA MOO ARAWAN ($15.00): Stew pork hog with boiled egg and steam Chinese broccoli. This dish was nothing special. It was tasty, but reminded me of a Chinese dish my mom would make than a Thai dish. It has a slightly sweet taste from the soy sauce and the Chinese broccoli was cooked perfectly.   MY FAVORITE DISH. ARAWAN PAD THAI ($22.00): Fresh prawn wok-stir fried in a tamarind sauce with rice noodle, slice chicken, peanut, green onions and bean sprouts-wrapped with lattice egg and side of crushed peanuts. This dish was amazing. I normally wouldn't care for pad thai, but the watier recommended it and said it was one of the most popular dishes. Seriously though, I can totally see why...it's beautifully presented and there was tons of flavor. The pad thai wasn't overly sauced and it wasn't dry either. It was made perfectly. At $22, it better be though.   DUCK RED CURRY ($18.00): Roasted duck in a red curry coconut milk broth with red peppers, zucchini, tomato, grapes, pineapple, asparagus and sweet basil leaves. The flavor of the curry was good but it wasn't anything memorable. I thought the duck was quite dry and it was disappointing. The pineapple was actually a nice touch to the dish but that was the only thing great about it. I would pass.    Overall, I thought Arawan is a decent Thai spot if you want a change from Lotus of Siam. The place is also known for desserts, but unfortunately, they do not serve it during lunch. The service was good, always making sure the water was full. The food was served pretty fast as well. I think what made this place stick out was the pad thai and I would literally just visit Arawan for that noodle dish.",

I also ordered on a side of appetizers chicken satay..so delicious! They even added a small butter bread underneath satay which has a amazing taste in your mouth.

Usually server just wants your money and careless about your well being but this servest cares more than that. I recommend you this beautiful place!",

    "text": "Where do I start? The decor? Gorgeous. Not crazy omg I'm in Vegas. Just so very unexpected for a Thai restaurant in the Commercial Center. Understated. Modern. Great for a date. Not stuffy while still impressive. The customer service? Perfect blend of being on top of things without interruptions. And a very good looking staff, if I may say so.  The food? I can't believe the presentation of the Pad Thai. Long story short, it's wrapped in a cage made of egg. Topped by a perfect pair of incredible prawns. They might be shrimp, but that just doesn't seem good enough to describe these massive and succulent beasts. The noodles are perfectly cooked and seasoned. Sometimes Pad Thai can be too sweet or taste like Vinegar. Not here. Perfectly presented and cooked, this is the new standard in Vegas Pad Thai.   We also had Spicy Mint beef. Terrible. If terrible means freaking amazing! It was not spicy hot but full of spices and flavor. Our last main course was chicken curry. Again, the layers of flavor were insanely complex while not assaulting the palate. Lol, I seriously just used palate in a sentence. Slow down James Beard.   For dessert it was suggested we try the special. It was valentine's day. My best friend and I are not remotely a couple. But the lady obviously assumed we were and suggested we share the chocolate cake with strawberry ice cream. We giggled but I was truly impressed that if we had been a couple of guys on a date, we wouldn't have been made to feel uncomfortable. As two gay guys we were treated just like everyone else and actually encouraged to just be ourselves. That's huge. That chocolate cake? It took 10 m minutes. Why? It was freshly made to order and filled with hot strawberry filling. Topped by a heart shaped macaroon that was most definitely not from a box and homemade strawberry ice cream you know from the first bite to the point where you'd lick the plate if you were at home, this dessert indicates a True pastry chef is in the kitchen. In fact, no matter where you decide to eat in the Commercial Center, or Downtown, save some room and eat your dessert here. You won't be disappointed.   I've been eating Thai food for over thirty years and I'm not a huge fan of Lotus with Komol fairing a little better. This place reminds me of the best places in Little Thailand in Los Angeles. Please eat here. We need this place to thrive!",

The food is first rate; the service is unobtrusive and top notch plus the staff is friendly and helpful.  The decor is cool and you have your choice of seating, including one area without chairs if that is your desire.   This appears to be all family run, as we have chatted with the greeter (the father) the mother, who is the cook, 2 sons who are waiters and the daughter who is the pastry chef. Lunch specials here include drink & dessert and are all under 10 bucks.  Portions are generous.  I am a big guy and I always leave full.  This place is fresh, clean and comfortable, and is (IMHO) definitely on a par with Lotus of Siam, which is a neighbor in this multi use center.  You have a fan, Arawan...  I'll be back soon.",

    "text": "This is my new favorite Thai restaurant. After heading to Cornish Pasty Company on a hunt for more unique desserts, we spotted Arawan and knew we had to try it. It took a couple of months, but we finally made it and are so glad we did.  The place wasn't very busy, but it certainly should be! It's got a more upscale, romantic vibe than most Thai restaurants, and all the employees were very friendly and open to giving suggestions.   We started with chicken satay, which was delicious, but that's hard to mess up. In Thailand, we love stopping by the beach for fresh fried fish but had yet to find another restaurant locally that could recreate those flavors...until now. The fried catfish was amazing with the perfect batter and a slightly spicy lemongrassy sauce that I wanted to drink. The fish is also huge so plenty of food for two or even three if you order more appetizers.  We ended with the Mango Island dessert, which was full of flavors and textures. I can't wait to try the other desserts on the menu, none of which are simple.  It seems a lot of customers are overflow from Lotus of Siam. I personally prefer the food here, although the menu isn't as extensive. I also didn't get sick after dinner like I have every time I've gone to LoS. The food tastes fantastic and is presented beautifully, making Arawan a full experience rather than just a place to eat.",

Our visit was scheduled in order to take advantage of the 3-course, $9.95 luncheon special that is offered on weekdays.  The first course of egg drop soup is not what comes to mind when dining in a Thai restaurant though it was probably the lightest and best we have ever experienced.  Entrees of Pad Thai and BBQ chicken were shared with the former being slightly over sauced while the latter a tad overdone though the wing and thigh meat were juicy.  The last course was a raspberry panna cotta that was a light and delicious conclusion to our filling meal.",

The decor is as hip as any new restaurant can be without feeling pretentious.  The food was all light and fresh, with just a very subtle hint of spiciness. The Arawan Fresh Rolls are similar to spring rolls you'll get elsewhere. The Pad See Ew was great, and not as oily as Lotus of Siam. The Ribeye Crispy Basil is one of the more expensive things on the menu, but totally worth it - lightly pan fried Thai basil leaves atop slices of ribeye steak and thinly-sliced veggies with young green Thai peppercorns. Dee-lish. The Spicy Mint (ground beef) was tasty, too. I could have done without the Fried Tofu appetizer, but I don't think it's on the menu they're about to debut.  Con: No liquor license yet (as of 8/5/2015)",

Very clean and modern decor. The food presentation of each and every platter we order a solid 10. We had several of the appetizers and each one was superb in presentation. The food taste gets an 8 except for the soup we had - now that gets a 10 for taste. My favorite Thai dish is pad Thai and though we ordered the Arawan pas Thai it fell short. It was mainly the noddles, no peanuts (I've always eaten pad Thai with peanuts), and the only protein on this platter was one large prawn sliced in half and nicely decorated ontop. Would I return? Yes I would but will be ordering something other than the pad Thai. And hoping that next time we are there, they have their alcohol license straightened out. On this trip they didn't sell any alcohol and on a Friday night after working all week a glass of wine or a beer would have been great.",

Their Arawan Pad Thai is by far the most pretty Pad Thai dish I have seen on all Thai restaurants I have been to. Try it! The lemongrass chicken wings were very tasty as well. We were full, but could not resist in trying their desserts. Beautifully decorated and very delicious. I really enjoyed the ambiance of this place. Very modern and spacious. I would definitely come back here when I am in Las Vegas. Thank you for a lovely dinner experience.",

I came at lunch time and ordered the ribeye crispy basil and the soft shell crab (both are specials) I asked for the ribeye to be cooked medium rare (meaning just some pink in the middle) instead it came out seared so very rare and chewy. The softshell crab dish was way below average and expectations as well. The restaurant wasn't so busy during lunch and the waitress never came over to ask how everything was until the end of the meal. They were also having their own lunch and the whole staff including cooks was more interested in their own meal. I think the cooks rushed the ribeye in order to sit down and eat their own lunch. I said something to the waitress finally but they didn't do anything to fix it, just said sorry. I paid $71 for a meal that wasn't even eaten with horrible service. I would recommend going to Lotus of Siam! It's in the same parking lot area as this restaurant they have a bigger selection of specialty dishes that are actually appetizing.",

Even though it's in a run down complex and looks not-so-great from the outside, once you enter, it's a completely different experience. Very nicely decorated, the ambience is almost romantic and way better than even Lotus of Siam, whose food we loved! :) Our table was ready when we arrived. While we ordered we were served complimentary fried wantons with the sweet and spicy sauce, which was good. A few of us had to take a flight back soon, and they were very accommodating in getting their food orders in and out first. We ordered a lot of items (Chicken Satay, Panang Curry Chicken, Red Curry Chicken, Veg and Chicken Pad Thais) and all of them were very good. The only items that I will not order again are the Green Curry Scallops. They were definitely not fresh and smelled fishy and chewy, though the gravy was very yummy.  I would also critique the amount of white rice (paid) served which is very less. The desserts are a must-have. We tried the Mango Sticky Rice, The Banana Puffs and the Affogato. All were really really good. All-in-all, a great experience!",

The green curry chicken and curry short ribs were also quite tasty and equally filling.  Thankfully we left room for desert her CHEF Gail shines   Do not leave without sampling some of her desert creations. We had the chocolate mousse cake and fried banana with green tea ice cream and orange cookie. They looked so good we were reluctant to cut into them. Two deserts wee plenty for our party of three. The deserts capped a great dining experience. Food was excellent, service attentive without being annoying and good value for the money. Definitely worth checking out. One note: as of our visit they have not yet received their liquor license. They have applied and expect to be serving shortly.",

Like most Yelp reviews these are the musts haves for your first visit (though what ever you explore on the menu will be well worth your venture) but for the first visit..... ARAWAN PAD THAI..... Immaculate presentation, and the taste is not far behind! Delicious! CRAB FRIED RICE..... so light fluffy... flavorful.... yum! CRISPY LEMONGRASS CATFISH ..Whole catfish crispy-fried and topped with lemongrass, fresh mint, red onion, garlic, cashews, crispy basils and a homemade semi-spicy dressing.......Yes!!! again..... Yes!!!!  For some odd reason I did not get this on my first visit to Arawan, but I will highly recommend you try the catfish! Even if you are like me and not a big catfish fan.... this one is different... it is Amazing!!!! I beg you... try the catfish! Our dessert was the Banana Puff. It is Caramel banana ice creme, crispy puff pastry, banana, strawberry, chantilly creme, caramel sauce, walnut, walnut chocolate sauce. Oooooo yeah! Gotta add this to your bookmarks!",

The entire staff was friendly and smiling, and service was on point.  The food was delicious and beautifully presented. My friend and I went with Tom Kha soup, garlic short ribs, and Arawan Pad Thai. The photos say it all for presentation, my mouth says YUM. Prices are decent too, $58 for everything including the Mango Island dessert (this was soooooo good).

It's a combination of flavors and textures that make your eyes light up!   Arawan is definitely off the Vegas strip and doesn't carry the big Vegas flare, but it has good food and service. If you're looking to get away from the glam for a meal, venture to this small strip and give the locals some love. It definitely looks slightly sketchy from the outside, the strip the restaurant was located in made me feel vulnerable because I didn't know where it was exactly, but once we found it, I felt more secure. There are lots of vacant spaces available for rent and needs cleaned up a bit.",

    "text": "Items Selected: Thai Iced Tea Crispy Wontons Red Curry Fish Cake Ahi Tuna Larb Arawan Pad Thai Squid-ink Drunken Noodles Duck Palow Sweet Sensation Earthquake  Open now for just under two years, the choice to join a plaza already featuring world famous Lotus of Siam and Komol Restaurant originally an odd choice that had many labeling them 'that new Thai place near Lotus,' Arawan Thai Bistro and Dessert has defied the odds by etching out their own unique style of Thai cuisine that is quite unlike any other in Las Vegas, the duo of Chefs Jui and Gail creating some truly beautiful dishes with a focus on quality ingredients that do not compromise authenticity.  Technically located in \"Commercial Center,\" though if any local is asked the answer to \"where is it?\" almost always revolves around its Beard Award Winning competition, Arawan Thai Bistro and Dessert joins most of the Las Vegas off-Strip ethnic options in being largely understated in its outward appearance, a noon arrival on Saturday finding the inside perhaps 1/4 full but soon to fill past 2/3 over the course of the next thirty minutes, Its soft soundtrack and light decor making the space seem spacious yet intimate, the overhead lighting great for photographs of the sort of Thai Cuisine that most certainly deserves a Kodak moment.  Dividing the menu into Signatures, Starters, Entrees and Desserts, each section offering ten or more items at prices that are competitive to other fine-dining Thai restaurants in town, service at Arawan is of the gracious, yet not-entirely-organized style familiar to those who've dined in similar restaurants across Sin City, the meal beginning with a small plate of Wonton Chips and a housemade sweet and spicy Dipping Sauce, the Thai Iced Tea ordered mere moments after sitting down completely forgotten until another young woman was reminded, but still arriving more than five minutes after the first plates.  No doubt a refined concept, the focus here moreso on the food and its presentation than esoteric plates or expansive wine list of Lotus or Chada Thai, a perusal of starters shows everything from Spring Rolls to Larb and Papaya Salad present and accounted for, the more interesting options a quartet of Fish Cakes spiked with Red Curry that fry up light and oilless as well as the Ahi Tuna \"Larb\" that forgoes the typical ground Meat in favor of Poke-style Sashimi Cubes bathed in a spicy blend of Citrus, Mango, Avocado and crispy Shallots.   Moving on to entrees, all three taken from the Signatures though staples such as Drunken Noodles, Curries, and Mint or Ginger dishes are available with a choice of Meat toppings or Tofu, Arawan's Crispy Duck fares similarly to many in the area by way of slow roasting followed by a high temperature finish that leaves center pieces moist and succulent while unfortunately dehydrating the edges, the restaurant's eponymous Pad Thai performing more consistently and one-upping most by placing thin Noodles and Chicken punched up with Fish Sauce beneath an edible net, the two butterflied Prawns on top alone commanding the whole plate's cost at any Casino in town without being nearly as attractive, filling or complex.  Nearly lured in by both the Rib Eye and the Short Rib, but eventually deciding that something as unique as Squid Ink Drunken Noodles probably warranted a look, Arawan takes a chance at offending purists by replacing the flat Rice Noodles more commonly seen with Black Spaghetti and a similar spice profile focused on Thai Basil and Green Peppercorns, the flavors not particularly 'authentic' when paired to Cod, de-shelled Shrimp, Mussels and Scallops but delicious nonetheless, and easily the meal's most highly recommendable savory.  Happy to give any restaurant including \"Dessert\" in its title a chance to wow with sweets, Chef Gail clearly not one to be satisfied with Sticky Rice and Mango slices or Tempura Plantains, it was with tough choices made to account for both time and capacity that two items were selected from a total of nine, the Sweet Sensation taking the aforementioned Banana idea to new heights by wrapping the torched Fruit in a thin Pancake and sweetening it with condensed milk and sugar before adding Thai Tea Ice Cream, while a dish called \"Earthquake\" replicates Le Cirque's Petit Boule de Chocolat presentation, replacing the flavors inside with Lychee sorbet and Fruity Candies that add an extra layer of taste and texture to the melted Chocolate and hot, pureed Raspberries.  ***1/2: No doubt committed to its vision, most of the 'modern' ideas performing very well while desserts are not only delicious but aesthetically pleasing, Arawan Thai Bistro and Dessert is a place worth checking out in the same vein as Nittaya's Secret Kitchen in Summerlin, a change of pace from all the other Thai spots in town with an ambiance and variety of plates good for both the adventurous 'foodie' or couples just looking for something new to try on date night.",

This place is a gem! From the music, food taste, presentation and service... this place has AMAZING food! Their flavors are exquisite and dishes very colorful and aromatic!  The area where restaurant is located and the rather expected entrance might fool the first timers, but once you've had a chance to try the Ahi Tuna Larb, Arawan Pad Thai, the Duck Drunken Noodles or any of the distinctive Thai dishes, you'll understand why the restaurant has such a following.   Patissier Gail is always around assuring satisfaction and making sugar works of art worthy of a photograph. The presentation, attention to detail, exotic flavors, ambiance and service, Arawan serves more than food, you're treated with an entire experience. Art for your eyes and a symphony of flavors to your palate this place DELIVERS!   Great work! When in Vegas, you HAVE to visit this hidden gem.   If you want to experience Thai whit the most modern and tasteful approach, you HAVE to come to Arawan.",

We got the pad Thai, panang curry, and mixed vegetables. The pad Thai was a little too soggy but a great generous portion. Mixed veggies came with our choice of protein to which we chose tofu. The star of the show was panang curry. I can't even begin on how amazing the flavors are. It's sweet, spicy, and creamy. The dessert my parents got were chocolate cake but because it had nuts in it (which I'm allergic to), they gave me Thai tea ice cream instead which was so delicious.   Overall a solid place with fast service, great deals, & great food.",

At other restaurant's, you might get a mediocre cabbage and carrot soup, but here, you can taste the quality of their food from the beginning. Their pad Thai is great and has a perfect amount of tamarind paste. Desserts have all been not too sweet but just sweet enough. I can't wait to try more!  It is a very cute place for a date night!

TOTAL HIDDEN GEM!  Upon driving up to the restaurant, it is located in a little strip mall area on the other side of the stratosphere (red flag number one) and the exterior of the shop because it is connected on a strip mall looked run down and super dingy (red flag number two for me). It really does go to show that you shouldn't judge a book (or restaurant) by its cover! When you walk in, the atmosphere is COMPLETELY different! There's soft music playing in the background, the restaurant is nice and clean and pretty spacious and the staff there was simply amazing!  We got there for lunch and got the lunch special. My friend got the panang curry that came with rice, a side of soup AND a dessert too! I got the drunken noodles that came with a side of soup and a dessert and man, both of our food was AMAZING! We ate it so fast and didn't even talk because we were just savoring it! Plus, each lunch special was only 9.99 and the portions were just right! It was enough for both of us to share and we had some leftovers to take home too! The panang curry had such a burst of flavor to it with juicy pieces of chicken to accompany the dish. They aren't skimpy on the chicken pieces either, both dishes had generous amounts of chicken to it! The drunken noodles had fresh basil added to give us that pop of freshness for a dish.  All in all, I am going to come back here! I only wish there was another place closer to Henderson!! If you are in the mood for Thai food and are near the area, give this place a go!!!",

It's located in a very dilapidated plaza surrounded by shuttered and abandoned stores and restaurants, and once you get into the plaza you really have to keep your eyes peeled in order to see the tiny and inconspicuous Arawan.  Inside, the place is clean and well-kept though not as opulent or grand as Lotus of Siam.  They seemed to be having some air-conditioning problems the evening we visited as they had a large portable unit running.    The staff were very friendly, and they have a large selection of dishes to choose from.  We started with Chicken Satay bites which were juicy and served with an absolutely delicious peanut sauce. For entrees we tried the Arawan Pad Thai and the Short Rib Yellow Curry.  Two home runs for sure.  The Pad Thai was served surrounded by an amazing egg net and featured large prawns atop the dish.  It was delicious!  The yellow curry was equally delicious and tasted like a rich, complex curry with lots of subtle flavors.  The beef was fork-tender.  Save room for dessert!  They were sold out of the creme brulee, so we tried the Sweet Sensation.  This was quite good and a bit like a softer banana spring roll.  The thai tea ice cream was perfectly flavored.    They do not offer a full bar, but soft drinks were refilled without charge even though they seemed to be from a can rather than a fountain.    Overall this was a delicious Thai dining experience though I do wish they would relocate to a space that would be more worthy of the quality of this restaurant.",

Roasted duck / Ribeye steak As I know, The Thai food is famous for Curry and Pad thai, I didn't expect what I ordered delicious. But Ribeye was really good, And The Roasted duck was exceeded my expectations.  Scallop green curry / Pad thai It was copious! It served with many shrimp and scallop. it was great to enjoy with everyone.  Desert Mango Ice dessert was little bit weird. Because it has rice, I never seen such a dessert. But Tastes and The server was really good.",

    "text": "My friends and I were in Vegas for the weekend and mutually agreed that Thai food was (and always is) the go to food. I really enjoyed this place and am so glad we decided on it. The restaurant is a little small but well decorated. We also had the best service.   Chicken Larb - So flavorful. One of my favorite Thai dishes so I had to get it. Different from the lettuce I'm used to eating it with but I'm not complaining.   Crispy pork and Chinese broccoli - Decent... I could've probably done without. That pork belly was indeed super crispy but not a must try on the menu for me.  Pad See Ew - Good.. not particularly special, however I have never had bad pad see ew either so it was up to par with what I'm used to.  Egg Papaya Salad - NEVER in my life have I seen papaya salad served this way before!! And with Vietnamese ham, salted egg and fried pork rinds?? Unreal. I don't know how it works but it totally does. It's a symphony of flavor in my mouth and each ingredient compliments the other. You mix it yourself. Oh yeah, totally spicy too and everything we ordered was 3 stars but it was amazing. Loved this dish.   Pad Thai - One word.. sweet. And sweet isn't how I typically like my Pad Thai but I don't usually get it anyway (it was for the others in my group) so I'm indifferent about this dish.   Stars of the show were the papaya salad and chicken larb. I only wish the portions were bigger because they seemed so small and much smaller than what I'm used to in Seattle.",

    "text": "If someone asked for a 'hidden gem' in Vegas, this place would come to mind.  I keep forgetting how 'shady' the surrounding neighborhood and strip mall is the couple of times I have been here.  The outside of Arawan is so discreet we passed it by several times and thought we were in the wrong plaza.  However, it is worth the effort as the experience here always delivers.  You can just tell when a place cares and here the chef has a passion for the food and the pastry chef has a passion for pastry.  Service is very efficient and professional as you'd expect from a Thai restaurant.  What makes this particular restaurant special is the attention to detail and presentation.  Pad Thai here seems to be the house special as it is pad thai with chicken but then it is wrapped in an egg net and served with two giant prawns.  It is by far the most extravagant pad thai I have ever had.  Short rib with yellow curry is in a class of its own as the beef is fork tender the flavor of the curry sauce is so balanced with the fragranced white rice.  It is truly a match made in Thai heaven.  I really think this would be great place for a date as the ambiance is intimate and somewhat romantic.",

We were greeted with awesome customer service, our server was beyond knowledgeable about the menu offering suggestions. We were very well taken care of.   We ordered the thai tea,  fortune blossoming tea,  chicken satay bites, pad thai with beef,  garlic shortribs, and the chocolate lava cake.   Wow. Nothing disappointed at all. Everything was beautifully presented, and the taste was amazing. Our server even explained re: the prep time for the lava cake ( I already know all about that cake tho)  Even though they closed at 10:00pm they never rushed us, they allowed us to take our time.   Would truly recommend this was wonderful food- the pricing is a reflection of quality and presentation   Location Sahara/ Maryland-- ample parking",

We started off with a spring roll appetizer that was very well cooked and had great flavor. I ordered the duck noodle soup and wifey ordered the lobster pad Thai. The noodle soup was rich in flavor and I did enjoy it. The duck was plenty and did get a few breast slices along with the usual bony parts. The duck was cooked very nicely and the skin roasted very well.   The pad Thai came with this very cool looking egg \"cage\" with a nice size lobster tail on top. The portion was big enough for both to share and it had great flavor.  The staff was really nice and attentive and we spoke for a bit about how long they've been open and how they can be super busy during a big convention, so do call ahead and make a reservation.  Although not in the best area, still a great place to check out!",

    "text": "The consistent great reviews here on Yelp don't lie--this place was awesome. I got the fried duck with a side of red curry, and my wife got the chicken pad Thai. We split two appetizers, the arawan roll and egg rolls. The fried duck was really good. The amount of meat was smaller than expected given the price but considering it was more of an uncommon meat and the fact that it tasted great, it didn't bother me too much. The pad Thai was a lot of food, and it was just the right amount of spice. Their spice scale for everything on the menu with a pepper beside it (curries, pad Thai and other dishes) is mild, medium, and hot. From other Thai places, they said it's comparable to a 1, 5, and 10, respectively.   I wasn't too much of a fan of the arawan roll. It was too overpowering of vegetables. The egg rolls, however, were really good.   Service was great. We had a team of wait staff serve us versus just one person, and they were always quick to fill our water as well as ask us if we needed anything. Our food came out in a timely manner as well.    As others have noted, the location is ... Well, let's just say it doesn't feel like we were in the safest of neighborhoods based upon looks alone. But don't judge a book or in this case, restaurant by it's cover/building by it's looks!  Ultimately, we never felt unsafe, and everything from the food to the service was great! Definitely recommend this Thai restaurant",

Really nice ambience and great simple but effective decor. We had several dishes on both nights but the highlight was the orange chicken and the Panang curry which was superb. The desserts are True work of art that need to be seen to be appreciated. A True family restaurant with a really high regard for customer service. I promise you will not be dissapointed. Tanya was also a great server who kept us all smiling.",

I had the pad thai and it was delicious but lacked any difference from other Thai places other than how it was plated and the two big prawns that it is served with. Dessert was a different story. Their menu is short and sweet. Containing traditional items like cake and ice cream then having their own desserts that are unique. I tried the mango island, I would order it again next time around.",

    "text": "A fortuitous surprise! We planned on eating at the Lotus Siam, and arrived before they were open. Craving Thai food, we decided to try Arawan, located nearby. For starters we had the Larb Ahi, which was perfect salad for the hot weather we are experiencing. Flavors were spot on Thai. Hubby ordered the chicken red curry, which he claimed was the best curry he had ever eaten! A multitude of flavors that were well balanced and tasty. I ordered the soft shell crab pad pong karee, which is crab meat scrambled with eggs in a seasoning, and the crab lightly battered and fried to a crispy, delectable dish. Portions were large, and we decided to box some of our meal for later enjoyment so we could have room to try one of their world renowned desserts. We were not disappointed with the mango island. Combination of coconut cracker, green tea sticky rice, mango sorbet and puree, and a decadent coconut milk sauce to drizzle on top. YUM! Unlike many desserts, this one tasted amazing and was beautifully crafted. Must stop by! Think we got lucky with an early dinner, so you may need to cal ahead for a reservation.",

    "text": "As a writer and an avid reader, one thing I have learned to do is not judge a book by its cover. Same is True, it seems, for restaurants. First, DO NOT judge this fantastic restaurant by its location. It is in the Commercial Center on Sahara. Also, do not judge the restaurant by its front as it looks a little worn out (maybe in keeping with the Commercial Center). Once I stepped into this restaurant, I was shocked by clean, almost crisp, and trendy look. It was 6 p.m. and the restaurant wasn't yet busy. Still they had my table ready (reserved with my name on it) and I was seated immediately even though I was an hour early for our reservation.  The front of the menu had house specialties and the back were the more traditional Thai dishes. We started with the Arawan Fresh Roll which was shrimps, fresh cucumber, crunchy carrots, bean sprouts, aromatic mint leaves, and crisp lettuce wrapped with moist rice paper - served with homemade semi-sweet chili sauce. It was delicious as expected but I was really surprised at how fresh and crisp the vegetables were.  Next we had the Yellow Curry Short Ribs. (Beef short ribs meat simmered in a hearty yellow curry coconut milk broth, with roasted red potatoes, carrots and onions). It was just crazy good with mild yellow curry made creamy by the coconut milk broth. We paired that with the Pineapple Fried Rice which contained  shrimp and chicken, egg, cashew nut, pineapple and onion. The sweetness of the fried rice was a great pairing for the curry.  We finished the meal by not sharing dessert. Kathy had the Mango Island dessert which was mango gelato, creamy sweet sticky rice, mango passion fruit cremeux, crispy waffle, whipped cream, crunch almond, mango sauce, and creamy coconut sauce. I had the Sweet Sensation which was a Thai pancake with sweetened condensed milk and sugar, Thai tea ice cream, brulee banana, fresh strawberries, and oreo crumb. I was amazed at how much the ice cream actually did taste like a Thai Tea which I love.  The food and service were well beyond any expectations I may have had. They have an inventive menu and I can hardly wait to go back and try more of the house specialties and some of the other desserts as well. By the way, they have an in-house pastry chef that makes the desserts to order.  This is a place that should be high on the list of anyone who enjoys GOOD Thai food served in a manner more found in high end, expensive restaurants.",

Ambiance: Although the location of the restaurant is in eastern part of Las Vegas, the restaurant more than make up for it with the decor in the restaurant, it's modern, hip, and vibrant.  Service: Service was very good. The staff was well trained  and very accommodating with our group, which was 20. They have a good grasp of their menu both the entrees and desserts.

Our group ordered the Arawan pad Thai, crab fried rice, soft shell crab green curry and the chicken wings. The waffled egg on top of the pad Thai was a creative touch. Overall, the food was surprisingly tasty and the portions were mid-sized. Thai iced tea was also delicious!   Also, I had to order the creme brulee because I saw the pictures on yelp... It was a picture-worthy dessert but the taste isn't anything extraordinary. When I'm back in Vegas on a weekend and looking for some Thai, I would definitely come back.",

    "text": "Having lived in Thailand and worked for the Thai Government here in the States, its fair to say I've eaten my fair share of US based Thai food. I decided based on some reviews that I would try Arawan Thai in Las Vegas. As others have described the area, it's located in a sketchy -- downright unattractive strip mall sandwiched in between the Las Vegas Strip and downtown. I mean we ain't talking the Bellagio here - I would encourage those with NV carry permits to do so .  Inside the restaurant, the decor is a lot better than the area deserves. As I scanned the menu and looked at prices (which I've found through sad experience has little to do with how well the Thai food is prepared) I couldn't help think what in the hell are they putting in here? Gold flakes?  I mean $16 for a simple chicken penang curry??  Four miserly pieces of chicken satay for $11? And a VERY salty chinese brocolli and crispy pork belly added another 15 bones thank you very much.  WOW. Penang was somewhat decently flavorful with the proper spices but the sauce was thin and bland - despite being ordered \"phet\" aka spicy (I do speak Thai fluently so there should have been no misunderstanding). To add insult to injury to this staple of Thai cuisine, some of chicken pieces (breast meat at least) appeared to be undercooked and chewy.  The four miserly satay skewers were mostly ok but the little glass thimble (about half the size of an ordinary shot glass) of peanut sauce was barely enough to cover one piece. We finally were able to get more after asking twice. Charging for steamed rice seems all the rage these days with Arawan following suit. No problem with an establishment making money, but $2 a peice for small bowl of rice per PERSON seems a tad excessive.  Bottom line, for this overpriced place, the dishes should have been without compromise - not poorly prepared Americanized psuedo-Thai food. A recent interview asked Thai restaurant owners what they do to prepare Thai food in America, the answer was \"easy, we just make it like we would for children\".  In other words, add tons of sugar, and eliminate most of the chilies, and there you have it. This perfectly describes the food here. My conclusion, save your money for the slots where you might have better chance of getting something back for your money. In this same dingy complex there is another Thai food place called Lotus of Siam, I understand it is much better. We will see next time!",

Next time I go, I will order the regular Pad Thai, the two butterflied shrimp on top of the Arawan dish are not worth the extra $7. As for the Pad Thai itself, it was presented in what appeared to have been a lattice-like basket made of eggs.  It was the best I've ever had!!! I can't possibly, find the words to describe the deliciousness that unfolded in my mouth...  For dessert I had their Mango Island dessert.  It was too pretty to eat; but, despite that, I ate it. It was different but good. I can't accurately describe it because I've never had anything like it before...I'll be more descriptive next time (I have to come back again)!

    "text": "We stopped by this afternoon craving authentic Thai food and man did they deliver. We were fans of Lotus of Siam but this place has won us over. Not only was the food outstanding but the service was on point. Out of the two of us I am the spice eater my other half not so much but we've both spent time in Thailand and appreciate real Thai food not the Americanized stuff. We started with a bowl of their Tom Kha and it wasn't overly sweet the chicken was tender and the lemongrass was thinly sliced so you could eat it. I ordered the ribeye spicy basil extra spicy and the broth had so much flavor so did the steak it was flavor then intense heat loved it. He had the curry branzino which was perfectly deboned and very flavorful. We will be coming here over lotus of Siam btw they have really great dessert.",

Presentation was wonderful and the desserts are out of this world. They even have great a tea leaf selection and fresh coconut water. I definitely recommend any of the curry dishes, basil ribeye, creme brulee, and the fresh rolls.  Service is impeccable, place is cozy clean and comfortable. Don't let the shopping center scare you this place may not be in the best part of town but even my \"location snob\" husband is willing to make the schlep out to eat here.   Everyone I've taken to this restaurant has since introduced other people to this restaurant which is a testament to how great this new little place is. Forget about Lotus of Siam, that place is a has been. THIS is the good stuff for food snobs.",

Quick look at Yelp, and immediately knew WE HAD TO TRY IT.   Oh my food heaven! This place was OFF THE CHARTS!! An amazing atmosphere - clean, simple, comfy, elegant.   The service... Well it was probably some of the best service I've ever had. Never did either of my drinks get below halfway (I was pounding the strawberry infused water haha), the timing of each dish coming out was spot on, and the constant suggestions and check-ins made for a very nice evening of letting them take care of you! This is a special shoutout to our wonderful waitress Tania (I'm hoping I spelled it right!!), who was just so kind and attentive to us, it really made for a relaxing, enjoyable dining experience. But I will give a HUGE THANK YOU to all of the staff, the way they worked together, and seemed to enjoy each other's company as well as the customers, was top notch, and genuine through and through!  The food, honestly I don't even know where to begin! YOU CANNOT GO WRONG WITH YOUR ORDER! Everything came out nice and hot, spiced and marinated absolutely phenomenally, and full of such immaculate flavors that we had to keep ordering more!   This little spot will not only make you so happy you came, it'll blow your socks off, ESPECIALLY if you originally came to the area for Lotus, because Lotus is in trouble with this one year old GEM OF A THAI RESTAURANT!  Thank you so much all of you, we will see you on Tuesday!",

Highlights:  - Papaya salad - Crab fried rice - Thai glass noodle with chicken (can't remember what the exact name of the dish was) - Mango Island - beautifully presented and tasted as good as it looked!",

Felt like we lost a bet when we were left in this sketch strip mall, but then we found Arawan, what a pleasant surprise! Staff attentive and warm. Food presentation is lovely. Taste, wow. Highly recommend the Short Rib Yellow Curry. I had my leftovers in my hand while we waited for Uber. I'm normally willing to share part of my dinner with someone in need, but when a lady wanted to wash car windows for money to buy food; we had no car, or cash.  I somewhat reluctantly gave her my Panang curry.  Homeless people deserve yummy Thai food too.",

Once you enter the restaurant, it has a very small waiting area and the staff is buzzing all about but came up to greet us immediately.  Our party of 6 was seated within just a couple minutes.   The atmosphere immediately had a positive vibe that seemed infectious.  The staff seemed to be having fun as was the table next to us.  Water and the drink order were taken immediately and although the wine list was small, it did have a good variety and prices of up to $100/ bottle.  We had a bottle of Jordan and a bottle of Simi which we shared with the table next to us.  Orders were taken in a proper amount of time and the cook time was right on.  The Drunken Noodles and Pad Thai were the two items that I tried and not only was the presentation amazing but they were both very flavorful.  Towards the end of the dinner, the head chef came out to our table to present the desserts.  Apparently, she is the daughter of the owners and after becoming a pastry chef had come back to run the family business.  She brought us one absolutely beautiful creation on the house and it was so good we ordered 3 other items just to see how she would present them.  Arawan takes a little bit of effort to get to but it is so worth the trip.  Come in with a smile and a light heart and they will take care of the rest.  I plan on returning the next time that I am in Vegas.  Thank you for a great night...I wish you all great success.",

We started with the Arawan Fresh Roll which was one roll sliced into pieces for $8. We then each had a cucumber salad for $4. Entrees were the Spicy Mint Plate ($12.00) and Pad See Ew ($12.00). All items were fresh and tasty, although we though the roll and Spicy Mint contained way too much basil as it was rather overpowering. Service was spotty as we had trouble getting the waitresses attention for drink refills. Bill total was $56 which is much too high for Thai food. Doubt we will be back as there are many other places with just as good food but at lower prices.",

The prawns in the pad thai were tasteless and had a mushy/pastey texture, very unappetizing. Besides that, everything else was good. The flavors and seasoning were on point. Service was great.

We had reservations for 7 but walked in right behind a group of 7 local girls who spoke to the host in his native language.  Next thing we know, we are shuttled off to the side room. Service was slow & only got worse from here. It took 90 minutes (yes 90!) for 3 out of 4 appetizers to arrive.  The fourth- never came & the waiter was completely confused about it.  He had it written down, but didn't know why it never came. 3 of our 7 entrees get delivered..no apologies. A few minutes later,  I go to check things out since no one has come by our table with the rest of our entrees, to apologize or refill drinks.   I see the waiter in the main room and ask if there was a problem with there remainder of our order.  He says no, he will check on it.  I see the earlier mentioned table of 7 in the main dining room- all with their drinks and entrees.  45 minutes go by and finally the last of our dishes come out.  I tell him to make sure he takes the appetizer that never came off the bill.  He says he will bring it now- no thanks!  He offered a complimentary dessert instead.   My meal (Drunken Duck) was 1 star at best.  The noodles were congealed together and it was lukewarm. When he came by for dessert, I told him we weren't interested and he was annoyed that I wouldn't order a dessert, that I wouldn't eat, to make him feel better about the bad service.  He could have comped a number of items from the meal we ordered but chose not to. Over three hours from start to finish with 7 of us talking about how bad the service was and disappointing the food was.   Save yourself the trouble- the whole experience was inhospitable, rude and not good.",

    "text": "So it is in the same sketchy shopping center as Lotus of Siam (Los). Full disclosure LoS is one of my favorite restaurants, so know that I am coming in with that perspective.  Based on reviews I tried it instead of LoS, here are my thoughts: Pros: Atmosphere: much nicer than LoS,. clearly new, modern and clean interior. Would be nice setting for a date. Service:, fantastic, friendly and helpful with the menu. Very attentive. Dessert: this place shines at dessert. Both the mango and the coconut dishes were beautifully presented and tasted even better. Worth coming here for dessert alone.  Cons: Wine list- so LoS has one of the best lists in America. Arawan does not. I'll leave it at that. Not sure if you can bring your own, but if you want decent wine, you should.  Food- Interesting and smaller menu than LoS (not a negative as I think LoS is too much).  Had the sea bass, which was nicely cooked. Only think that threw off the dish was the gelatin textured sauce. It had almost a distractingly sweet flavor that took away from the heat of the dish.  Other dishes looked decent. General comment was that many lacked flavor.  Not sure if that is clientele driven or what. In fairness, the number of other diners I heard order \"zero spice\" was astounding. What the heck is thai food with zero spice?!   Overall- I'd go LoS hands down. If LoS was too crowded, I'd definitely come here for a decent meal (not drinks) and amazing drinks.",

Chicken pad Thai: hint of spiciness, wrapped in egg lattice, quite yummy. Mango sensation: meh, definitely not worth the price of another entree - it was just a bunch of things thrown together, the sum of which wasn't greater than its parts.  2. Service: friendly and helpful with recommendations.   3. Atmosphere: came for an early lunch, so it was rather quiet and calm.",

You can choose your spice level and for those who really like spicy, there is a level called \"Thai spicy.\" I rarely order dessert at restaurants, but I always make sure I save some room for dessert here because the desserts are both pretty and delicious. I've even been caught coming here twice in one day. They have a good lunch deal during the week in which diners can get a soup, salad, an entree, and dessert for $9.95 it's a great deal and you can try some of their food without spending too much. The manager Kay was really nice and always remembers me whenever I go....maybe because I go so often LOL",

The service was great, the atmosphere is peaceful and the food is just delicious! Every dish is created with loving detail and not only is the presentation wonderful but the food itself is outstanding. This time we started with the cucumber salad. It looked and tasted fresh, colorful and just the right amount of tang to it. Next we had the Catfish, Ribeye Steak, Drunken Noodles and Won Ton Soup. Every dish was perfect. I highly recommend the Catfish which can be ordered and shared by a group. Everyone at the table had some and thought it was the best dish of the night. This will be my go to place every time I'm in town.",

When we entered the restaurant, we were transported into a creative and tastefully decorated space. Our appetizer, the grilled chicken satay, was not up to par, but we are very picky because our ultimate standard for chicken satay is at an open air dining court in Singapore. However, the peanut sauce and sweet marinated chili cucumber slivers served with it were excellent. Our first main dish was a beautifully presented pad Thai. The flavorful rice noodles were wrapped by a thin egg net and and dramatically topped with fresh prawns. Next, we ordered the beef short rib yellow curry. We have never had short ribs in a dish like this. The meat was flavorful and fell off the bone. It was slightly too spicy for some of us but hit the spot for the heat lover among us, and the spice did not destroy the flavor. Finally, to top off a wonderful meal, we ordered the vanilla bean creme brulee. The sweet latticed dome that topped the dish made it almost too good to eat- but of course we dug in. The custard was fresh and and complemented the perfectly crisp caramelized sugar crust. Wish we could have ordered more of the desserts, but we will just have to return another time whenever we come back to Vegas. Highly recommended!",

I have traveled to many places across the country and basically only eat Thai food so when I tell you this is the best I have ever had hands down I hope you understand the weight of that comment.  For starters, the ambience is absolutely incredible. Just the right amount of lighting, not too loud, soft French music playing in the background, very nice decor and set up. The place is very sweet and romantic. The service is also incredible, very kind and attentive staff and food was almost immediately brought out.  Regarding the food and beverage let me say this is above and beyond, authentic Thai with a modern twist and elegance. Incredible tea selection and specials. Everything I have tried was incredible but I highly recommend the short rib yellow curry, squid ink drunken noodles, and the mango paradise for dessert. The presentation of every dish was beyond beautiful and elegant and the flavors and taste backed it up. Pleasant for the eye and the tongue.  Let me just say that if you drive past here and don't come in, you are making a grave mistake. I have traveled to Chicago, New York, Hawaii, Mexico, the Bahamas, San Francisco, and many more places, having dined at some of the best restaurants in the world and let me tell you this place is one of my favorites I have ever had. I will be coming back time and time again.",

I understand you were busy but from a management point of view, but you might want to schedule more people on a busy night as expected. The food was amazing though!",

    "text": "Why the quick update? Menu changes, yo. Why the drastic downgrade? Read on.  My opinion of Arawan was already trending downward after my second visit for lunch. The chicken pad see ew lunch special was underwhelming compared to some pad see ew dishes that I'd had in the past. The protein portion was small, which perhaps I should have taken as a warning because chicken is such a cheap protein, and it was undersauced compared to most restaurants' takes on the dish. The cream cheese dessert wasn't very memorable either. For context on how this changes things numbers-wise, this whole lunch was at best (what some would phrase as) a 3.75 star rating.  I went back to Arawan less than a month after that for lunch. I was very surprised to learn that they'd gotten rid of their $9.95 lunch specials menu and replaced it with a bit of a beast. There are now 21 \"plates\" available weekdays 11am-3pm, in contrast with 10 options on the old menu. Unfortunately, other than the Mixed Vegetable dish ($10), the dishes are all $12-19. I was also shocked that they'd removed the beef panang curry from this section, although to be fair it's still present in another section of the menu.  The salad was the same, and it was served with the crispy noodles mixed in / dressed now instead of placed awkwardly on the side as before. My first disappointment was when I realized that they'd stopped serving the egg drop soup with the lunch special. You may recall from my first review that I loved that soup, and if so, you'll understand my despair.  Then my entree arrived, the Duck Drunken Noodles ($15). Again, it was underwhelming in overall flavor. It's solidly a notch below the dish at another local Thai restaurant that launched my love affair with drunken noodles. The duck portion was frankly pathetic. I know duck isn't the cheapest protein, but the price was higher than baseline dishes, and I only got maybe 3 or 4 pieces of duck meat, and 2 to 3 pieces of skin.  The \"coffee cake\" dessert was slightly tinier than I'd expected. Good flavor, not too sweet, but somewhat of an afterthought.   I may come back to Arawan for dinner to give them a fair shot at their best dishes and dessert. For now though, I don't envision myself returning for lunch, even if the next closest option for Thai gives me stomachaches (that's Komol, by the way). They just left me with a sour taste.",

When we got there at 8:30pm on a Friday night the place was absolutely dead (only two other tables seated).  My friends sarcastically said \"Great choice; its obviously really popular\", and they started complaining that they should have gone to the steakhouse.  Well, their attitude completely changed after they sunk their teeth into their meals.    Everyone thought there meals were nothing short of fantastic, and in the end were really glad we ended up here.       I am deducting 1/2 star because: Although the place has a pleasant decor, the atmosphere is not one that someone expects for a \"vegas experience\" due to the lack of people and hustle and bustle in the place.     Also, we weren't very impressed with the \"vanilla bean ice cream\" in the dessert; it wasn't bad, but it just wasn't creamy enough to say it was good....they should look for another supplier for their ice cream.",

Never thought a catfish could taste so good.  Also, had two orders of thai chicken with basil and one order of duck curry.   Cost for all was holy sheesh...$150?!!!  OK, we were accustomed to paying high prices at Hell's Kitchen and Mon Ami Gabi but the bill took me by surprise.  I'd definitely try it again the next time we're in Las Vegas but I would leave out the catfish.  OK, maybe leave it in and cut out something else.",

I've been here a few times with friends and family, but the ambience is so nice that it was the perfect place for date night. The always have fresh flowers,  relaxing music, and the service is fast and friendly. More importantly,  the food is delicious!   They're open weekdays for dinner, but also have lunch on weekends.  Lunch specials cone with a tiny dessert,  but you'll want to order a full one too!  All the food I've had had been yummy, but here are the faves:  So far my favorite dish is the short rib yellow curry. While it's a little pricy (around $22 I believe) the meat is so tender and flavorful. Must try!   Another one not to miss is the Arawan pad thai. One of the tastiest pad thais I've had,  plus the presentation is very impressive. They wrap the noodles in a net made of egg, and top it off with giant prawns.   Ok, the desserts. They have a little nook in the corner where they prepare their desserts. They're prepared to order,  and they look amazing. It kinda reminds me of Sweets Raku, but with a lot more seating space.   I usually get the Mango Island as a standard,  plus another for fun haha.  All the desserts are good,  but their signature has so many flavors and textures, and looks like a cute little edible terrarium. Nice for sharing.   Always a good experience here!",

The rib-eye's sauce was legit, and was cooked medium rare just the way we ordered it. The short rib was falling off the bone. Perfectly cooked. Melt in your mouth good.   Even though we were full, we couldn't leave without ordering dessert. Highly recommend the creme brulee...the presentation of it was as good as it tasted.   Last but not least, we were fascinated by their tea. We ordered the glorious paradise blossoming blooming tea. We didn't know what to expect, and was told to wait 6 min for it the flower to bloom...so we did. Do a time-lapse video if you order this drink. It's pretty awesome.   Hands down one of the best Thai restaurants we've eaten at...try it. Seriously. We are Thai food snobs, and this place lives up to the 5 stars. Great service too.",

We made a reservation here for dinner on Valentine's Day because it had such great reviews and we left very disappointed. When we got to the restaurant we were told that despite us having a reservation they didn't have a table for us as they had over booked. We were assured that a table would be made available to us soon if we'd like to wait. Given that it was Valentines, 8:45pm and we didn't have an alternative option we decided to wait. We finally got seated at a table at 9:20pm and remained optimistic about the food. After some time the waitress eventually came to take our drink order, she bought over a beer we ordered almost instantly and then 15 minutes later the wine arrived at the table. Our starters were quite good, not amazing, but good. The mains were a massive disappointment, the food was mediocre at best and we left still hungry. After receiving our meals it was getting quite late and most of the restaurant had emptied, it was made very clear to us that the staff wanted to close and they tried to hurry us up so they could leave - asking to clear dishes from the table whilst we were still eating etc. I noticed some nice looking desserts coming out of the kitchen while we were waiting for our food, and we never even got offered a dessert menu. Terrible service, extremely average food. If you're thinking about going here don't waste your time, there are far better options.",

    "text": "So disappointing to not be able to give this place 5 stars.  I had such high hopes after reading all the reviews.  I told my BFF this is where I wanted to have my bday lunch and that they had a special!  Too bad it wasn't avail the day we visited :( Strike 1!  Strike 2, there were food caked on my fork!  How did they not see it while wrapping it all pretty in a linen napkin??  And when I brought it to the servers attention, she took it, didn't apologize or anything and just brought me a new one.  Not sure what that was about, maybe she was too embarrassed?  We ordered the larb salad which I'm used to it being with pork but they only had it with chicken, the flavor was good but the chicken was not.  It was crumbled to the point of disintegration, not what I want for food texture.  We had also the tom yom soup with shrimp, it was tasty but for $7, I expected more than 2 shrimps!  And the final dish was the Thai spiced seabass. 1st of all, I don't think it was seabass that we were served, and for $24, we expected more than just lumpia sauce served over pan fried fish. Was that the last strike?  Nope!  After a disspointing meal, my BFF wanted to see if their dessert that everyone was raving over could save the day.  Um can't happen if they don't have it!  We ordered the mango & sticky rice, oh sorry, we don't have it.  What?!  That is the most popular dessert ordered at any Thai restaurant, how can they not have any?  Oh yikes!  I don't care how many people think this place is the bomb, they sure did bomb in a bad way for us!  Won't ever be back!",

    "text": "First class dining experience at Arawan Thai.   My wife and I were looking for Thai food in Las Vegas and saw some positive reviews on Yelp about Arawan Thai.  The reviews were spot on, this little gem was the perfect date night meal for my wife and I who were in Vegas celebrating our anniversary.  We had a spring roll appetizer which was delicious and crispy, cut on an angle and served with a tangy but sweet dipping sauce.  For our entrees we got Panang Curry with beef and Arawan Pad Thai, both were amazing.  The panang curry was easily one of the best curries I have ever had and the Arawan pad thai was delicious as well.  The presentation of these entrees were amazing and the entire timing of the meal was perfect thanks to the attentive waitress that made sure we had everything we needed.  All that being said let me get to the piece de resistance, the desserts at Arawan Thai are second to none.  Arawan employs two pastry chefs that roll out some of the best looking desserts I have ever seen.  My wife and I were quite full from our meals, however had to try at least one dessert.  The table behind us, ordered 5-6 desserts and licked each plate clean as if they had never eaten before.  Next time we return, my wife and I may start with a dessert, then work our way through our meal, and finish with another.  Amazing atmosphere, perfect timing of the meal, delicious food, attentive staff and dessert to die for.  We will be back, thank you Arawan Thai for a great anniversary meal.",

Three of us got the lunch specials and I got a salad. We got the small soup bowl--nice touch--but then waited 45 minutes before my salad came out and then we kept waiting for the rest of our party's food. We waited 15 minutes more and I finally got up from the table and tracked down the waiter to ask him about the 3 other meals. He looked at our table and ran to the kitchen. About 15 minutes later he brought out three more meals. Total 1.5 hours to get the food! Ridiculous. The table next to us was having the same problem getting their food. Was it good? It was as good as any good Thai restaurant. But no way is it worth the poor service. They never apologized or even came back to see how the food was.",

It's getting harder to keep my commitment to try something different each time. Maybe dessert counts for that!!  Today's was superb strawberry ice cream.",

No American sized portions here but it truly was the perfect amount of food.  Dessert was an amazing coconut ice cream with coconut flesh, sweet sticky rice and lychee gel cubes... Wow wow wow!!! Again, presentation was stunning and it was so delicious I couldn't help but devour before realizing I didn't take any pics. Sorry yelpers, but believe me, it's definitely worth a try.

We went early on a Friday and the got the last open table.  I was surprised how many people were eating there from other countries.  several cabs were dropping and picking people up from the place.  Arawan Thai Bistro sits it a shopping complex well off the main road.  There are a lot of other restaurants in the same area but this place appears to be the star.  This is not the type of place you just stumble upon.  We started off with a spring roll that was served with a chili pepper sauce that was amazing.  We heat had a great main meal and dessert.  The prices are amazing for the quality of the food and service provided.  They have a great lunch special that I want to try that includes an entree and dessert for $10.00.  The only slight negative thing is the red carpet in the back area going to the bathrooms is very dingy and needs replacing.  I would come back here anytime though and understand why they are rated so well.",

The place itself is in a very large and outdated shopping center, but this place upon entering is very cute and well decorated. We were seated promptly and given a complimentary appetizer by our waitress. The service was great, both our waitress as well as the manager (we think he was the manager) were very attentive and friendly during our entire time there, making sure we had everything we needed.   As far as food goes, very delish! I ordered the shrimp with green beans and ordered it with the hot sauce per our waitress's recommendation. My bf ordered the pad see ew with beef and it was also really good. I also had a lychee black tea (hot) that was so light and perfect on a cold, rainy and windy night! The thing that really put everything over the top was the creme brulee! OMG, it was very delicious and the presentation was beautiful! So glad to have opted for dessert!   I would definitely make the trek here again next time I'm in town!",

Either they served a smaller size or I was not hungry last time I came. My friend who is not a big eater also was not full after finishing their order that I ordered another plate of Shrimp Pad Thai to satiate our appetite. The bill was over $100 for 3 entrees, 1 appetizer and 1 dessert. Way too much for Thai food. I will probably eat something before eating here again so I won't be hungry.",

The basil rice and green curry were both excellent, although the green curry packs a spicy wallop so beware of medium spicy and higher. :-)",

Nobody there to greet me. Had to walk around a good five minutes before a waiter even asked us anything. Took us to our seat. Brought us water . Then our menus. We decided quickly what we wanted to eat . Took over a half hour for the waitress to remember to take our order . Said she forgot about it and laughed. We ordered all our food at once to hopefully make up time.  Took another half hour for food to get out. The \"chips\" they brought for us to munch on were okay. Only gave us a single chip each! When they brought out our food, they almost gave it to the wrong table. Set the food in front of them and everything . Then the waitress remembered it wasn't theirs and just switched the plates. May I note that the food wasn't horrible. Too much odd flavor combos. But I DID NOT intend to spend over $70 on meat portioned the size of a chicken nugget. Dessert looked good so ordered that as well. Again took forever. Had to push the waitress to give us the bill. Overall will never go again. Strongly encourage nobody to waste their time or money here.",

It definitely deserves a spot among the best.  The ambiance is classy without being uptight. The wicker chairs are a pleasure to sit in. The service was prompt. Everything was clean.   The Short Rib Yellow Curry is where it's at. This will not disappoint. The rib has plenty of tender meat that melts in your mouth. The roasted vegetables pair wonderfully with the curry. Spoon that curry on everything. I went with medium spice for the curry and got the perfect blend of taste and heat.   The Arawan Pad Thai is presented like a work of art. Beautiful criss-cross pattern and it's loaded with prawns. The prices are a bit higher than other Thai restaurants but it's definitely worth it.   The atmosphere, the presentation, the food. This place has it and at a reasonable price.",

    "text": "We were Yelping, looking for a Thai Restaurant and we found this gem. It's in this huge almost empty shopping center with lots of other Asian restaurants, not very welcoming at all. HOWEVER, when you walk in, it is the sexiest little place you will ever see. Now for the food, what is better than excellent? Even the water had a slice of strawberry. We had a whole catfish that was off the charts, with great garnish and sauce. I had the black ink noodle with an assortment of seafood and fish, the taste was incredible. When you think you've had enough they bring you the dessert menu, full of wonderful mango, coconut and wow!. This is really some of the best Thai I've ever had. Highly recommend this gem of a place.

    "text": "This is a very solid Thai restaurant. It has hints of Chinese fusion with dishes such as wonton soup, orange chicken, and complimentary wonton appetizer, but overall it's a solid Thai restaurant to add to the Vegas list of great Thai cuisine.   The beer and wine menu is pretty limited compared to other Thai restaurants, but the food is great. The look and preparation of the food might be one of the best in Vegas. The pad Thai was a gourmet dish that looked absolutely spectacular. And as far as spicy goes this might be the best bang for your buck at good Thai in Vegas. Desserts are supposed to be their specialty but I didn't try any this time around.   Arawan is worth a try. Not too expensive and good portion sizes make it a great stop if in the area. Or come during lunch if you can for their cheap and great 3 part lunch deal which is tough to beat in Vegas",

    "text": "I decided to stop here for a bite to eat before heading off to the Green Door which is conveniently located in the same plaza. The interior does not match the surrounding sketchy neighborhood. It's actually inviting & cozy. This place would make a perfect date night spot with soft elevator music playing in the background. I thought it was super quiet here so don't bring your loud friends here.   They give you complimentary wonton crisps with a sweet and sour dipping sauce. The spice levels are mild, medium, or spicy. We went with the medium. My friends and I ordered the lemongrass chicken wings in Tom Yum and the egg papaya salad for appetizers. The flavors were subtle with the wings. I would have liked the lemongrass and the Tom Yum to stand out more. The papaya salad was alright. I usually don't order papaya salad though.  I ordered the short rib yellow curry with rice. I really enjoyed my entree. It was mouthwatering, delicious! The tender pieces of the short rib fell off the bone and the curry was seasoned well. My friend ordered the lemongrass fried catfish. Catfish is one of my least favorite fishes but I liked their version of it. My other friend ordered the squid ink drunken noodles with seafood. I thought it was OK. The portion sizes are just right but truth be told, I could have had another piece of that delectable short rib!  For desserts, we ordered the vanilla bean creme brulee which came with gold flakes, a sugar dome, strawberries, blueberries, and chocolate & the Sweet Sensation which is sweet Thai banana pancakes with Thai tea ice cream, strawberries, Oreo crumbles, condensed milk, and chocolate. Wow, talk about a fancy presentation! Gotta love desserts that look pretty and tastes delicious!  The service was professional and attentive. They give you a carafe of strawberry mint infused water. They do not have alcohol. I rarely drink with Thai food so I didn't even notice until my friend had mentioned it. The spice levels are not your typical Thai spicy levels. Our medium spicy was more of a mild spicy so it's safe to bring your white friends here.  They have a second room with Zashiki style seating (where you take off your shoes and sit on a mat and a low table). I'm guessing this used to be a Japanese restaurant. I'm not sure if they will use it or not. Maybe when it gets more popular, they will.   Oh BTW, I was kidding about heading off to the Green Door. I just mentioned it so locals and you pervs will know how to find this place. :)",

    "text": "First let me start my review by saying I really admire the chutzpah of Arawan to open right next to Komol and in the same shopping center as Lotus of Siam.   This would be like my opening a little Vegan sandwich/salad shop in the Bronze Cafe parking lot.   Respect for that.  More importantly, respect for the delicious food they're churning out!   I've had the pleasure of having Arawan food twice now, once dining in and once getting carry out.   Dining in is a treat, as you step foot from the outside world of Maryland Square, which, putting it nicely has seen better days, into an immaculately serene and beautiful dining area.   There are various stylings of tables and chairs to choose from and they all look comfy in their own different ways.   Probably the nicest interior of any Thai restaurant in Vegas I've ever been to.   Then the waiter brought over the complimentary water and there was a small slice of strawberry in it to add some flavor.   At this point I was worried about 2 things.   1)  That I didn't make enough at my State funded job to afford the upcoming meal and 2) that my khakis and I might not be welcome in such a fine establishment.      Perusing the menu alleviated my first concern.   Although their special menu offerings ran a little higher than I like to spend on lunch, the lunch specials were affordable enough for me to still dine there AND not resort to Del Taco for the rest of the week.   Score!   At $9.95 it's a little higher priced than most Thai Lunch Specials, but more on that later.    I went with with the Spicy Mint Chicken LS.   First we were brought out some soup which I liked, but I'll be honest have no recollection of outside of that.  When my entree came out, the extra cost of the lunch special started to show itself.  I've had a ton of \"Spicy Basil\" lunch specials around town and most don't provide a fried egg with it.  I really enjoyed this addition to my \"normal\" order.  Here's where someone tells me an egg costs 2 cents.  I'm dumb and don't know such things.  I did the $1 brown rice substitution which is a fair price compared to some other Thai restaurants that charge more, and every component of the total entree seemed of high quality and cooked very well.  Definitely overall it was on par or better than most similar offerings across town.  After finishing the entrees the table was brought out where the extra money really comes through, the dessert!  The day I was there it was a fried banana egg roll THING with a small vanilla ice cream accompaniment.  If that sounds good to you you'd enjoy it.  Easy!  My second experience was calling in take out for the Spicy Mint Eggplant entree (not a lunch special).   It came to about the same price with a brown rice substitution as my dine-in meal but without soup or dessert :(    Eggplant was really delicious though.   Bright, large perfectly cooked pieces of eggplant.  I wish I could insert the Eggplant Emoji here.   Okay, maybe not.    The negatives:  I did have some difficulties with actually placing the order, in that the phone went to voicemail for about 15 minutes straight until on the 5th attempt someone picked up.   Also they said it'd be 15 and I ended up sitting in the restaurant for 10 minutes after that 15 minutes was up.   My time is precious, that's 10 minutes that could have been spent watching Drake Hotline Bling Memes.   Lastly they don't have a spice rating SCALE which I prefer, but instead want you to say Mild, Medium or Hot, which doesn't satisfy my desired heat.   I want somewhere in between medium and hot, but more tipped towards hot, but not enough that's going to make me cry.   Basically, a 7.   I can't convey that properly with a choice of 3 words.  All those negatives totaled up still are only worth a 1 star demerit.",

    "text": "So glad we ended up eating here than at Lotus Siam which is across the parking lot! Our first intention was to go to Lotus Siam but the wait was 45 mins and it was close to closing time. We waited but got impatient so we left. Good thing cus there were two other Thai Restaurants nearby (walking distance). The first one we came across is Komol and the second was Arawan. These two were literally right next to eachother. We chose one and that was Arawan which means Elephant in Thai. The place was small but very nicely decorated and you could see their chefs making desserts! Glad we came here because the food was on point! Had the pad Thai and I'm a pretty picky person when it comes to my noodle dishes, it was just as I imagined it to be. The Seabass was ok, if you like very sweet flavors. The seafood curry was good as well as the short rib yellow curry. Both full of flavors and spice! The rib eye numtok was the right amount of spice and so fresh! Of course, our spice levels were pretty high so the food tasted even better spicier! Had the egg rolls and I would have to say, I would not order them again. The stuffing was soggy and was basically just cabbage and carrots. We also had the fresh rolls and they were delicious and so refreshing! To end the night, we had their awesome and well-presented desserts! The earthquake was the chocolate ball where you would pour warm raspberry sauce on top to melt the ball to reach the lychee slushee filling and we also tried the Raspberry Lava cake which was so rich and moist with a side of strawberry ice cream! Yummm! This place made up for our wait and poor service at Lotus Siam. Next time you're thinking about Lotus Siam (if it's not too busy) I say... come to Arawan - Less wait and better service!!",

We had crispy duck which was right on and the ribeye crispy basil. The ribeye was tough, I think they substituted a sirloin, ribeye isn't that tough. We will try this place again and order something else.",

We had lunch here and it served with a cup of soup, small garden salad and dessert at the end.  The presentation of food and desserts were amazing as well as the taste.   Chef Gail, a pastry chef made us a signature dessert called mango island. It was fantastic, nothing to compare.  It is a must to try!!!!  My friend had cherry sorbet which was so good and refreshing.   We would extremely recommend this restaurant for whoever love Thai food and have sweet tooth like us. Go check it out. You will love it.",

    "text": "L-O-V-E!  I moved from Davis, CA (near Sacramento) to Los Angeles 9 years ago. I never found a thai restaurant as good as the one I left back in Davis.  That was, until tonight on vaca in Vegas. Why do you have to break my heart and exist in another state?!? Oh, the sadness.   We ordered: crab cakes $18: two tiny little tasty cakes with a small spicy ass side salad. It was the least favorite of what we ordered and I probably wouldn't order it again, but it wasn't bad at all.   Chicken satay $8 for 4 nice sized skewers of good quality chicken seasoned and cooked to perfection with a tiny cup of cucumber salad and peanut sauce on the side.   Tom Ka soup with chicken. I didn't care the chicken and wished I had either ordered tofu or shrimp, but the broth and flavors in the actual soup were DELISH. In Davis this was my absolute favorite meal and I have never found a place until tonight that serves a coconut milk-based broth that isn't greasy or watered down. It was perfectly rich and creamy and milky and I only wished I had ordered the large order with extra cabbage and mushrooms because it was delightful...even on a 104* day!   Duck $26-I didn't eat any, but my husband said it was good and chicken-y, but just a bit chewier. Didn't appear too crispy, generous portion, but I don't know how pricy duck is supposed to run.   Yellow beef curry $12-good, a little less soupy than we like, but LOTS of meat and potatoes and carrots and bell pepper, which we haven't had in too many curries before. It was good. The meat was super chewy and cut in huge pieces, which I didn't care for and didn't eat any of, but in all honesty, I could literally be a vegetarian...except for the occasional In & Out burger!   For dessert we ordered the traditional mango and sticky rice and while it was a small portion, it was delectable and the presentation made up for us wishing we had more. For $10 we would recommend this work of art!   The banana puff pastry with ice cream and bananas and strawberries and chocolate sauce...oh good lord...the best $12 we spent!   The place: hidden in a sketchy area, in a dark strip mall sort of looking place, near an alley that we drive thru while trying to find the dang place. Passed it once even with the GPS, but so glad we didn't give up and just go somewhere else. Inside is lovely and intimate. Nicely decorated and the layout makes it pretty private. Great date environment, yet good for families, too. The music was perfect: like a soft romantic classical-type blend.   The people: the gentleman running the place is SO very nice. His wife is the owner and chef. She puts her ENTIRE heart into every single dish and everything we ordered was literally a masterpiece. Everything came out at different times so we are slowly and did courses and we were so excited to dive in that I only got pictures of desserts...and even then little hands had already picked at them! The man's daughter is the pastry chef and prepares the desserts. She is as phenomenal as her mom. Our waitress was Jenny. She was very nice and attentive and deserved her 20% for sure. Everyone sort of whispers here and it's so nice and peaceful.   A little bummed they don't do anything for birthdays because we were celebrating our two littles, but oh well, still loved everything and left very happy! We will DEFINITELY come back the next time we are in town.",

    "text": "I've seen some people question the five star and number one rating for this restaurant and based on my experience I don't know why LOL. I am not an expert on Thai cuisine, so I don't know if its the best Thai food one could ever have but I know what I like. I found this place on Yelp in search of some good Thai grub and had a taste for some Shrimp Pad Thai as well as Thai Iced Tea. The place is tucked away in one of several buildings in a strip mall on East Sahara Avenue, not far from the strip but definitely not in the glitziest part of town by no means. LOL You won't come across it by accident but if you are looking for it, you can easily find it. (Use Google Maps) The outside is simple but, once you walk inside the atmosphere is cozy, relaxed, clean, and has the ambiance down almost perfectly. You feel right at home once inside this business.The host the night we were there was both friendly and helpful. It is a little small inside and he told us their were a couple of tables that just finished up and would have us seated withing 10 to 15 minutes. In terms of the food, to me everything was amazing. The Thai Wings and Shrimp Pad Thai are must orders. The presentation was for the Shrimp Pad Thai and tasted as good as it looked. Our server was so pleasant and nice like i said you felt at home as soon as you entered their establishment. They even got the little things right, such as a slice of strawberry in the water that was served. (Not Pictured) Again, I loved what we had, and the presentation, just like the meal itself, was completely professional. I gave it 5 stars because every one of my expectations for a relaxing and enjoyable meal out was met and exceeded to be honest. There is no doubt we will be back when I am in Vegas.   What you must try:  Thai Lemongrass Wings.  Shrimp Pad Thai",

    "text": "I normally don't give 5 stars for first visit, but based on our experience, they really do deserve it.  I came here based on reviews and all those YELPers didn't let us down.  We came early before a show, and we were actually the only ones in the place.  Several people came in after us, which is always a good sign.  This place is close to the strip, but not on it, and it appears to be a local spot.  The decor was very nice.  Service was top notch, everything you would really ask for in a restaurant experience.    Lets talk food.  There were 5 of us, 2 Adults, 1 Teen, 2 kids.  I was really looking forward to this meal, so I dove right in with 3 appetizers.  We had the Arawan Fresh Roll, Thai-Style Calamari and the Vegetable Egg Rolls.  All of them were fantastic.  The fresh roll was very delicate and very fresh.  The sweet chili sauce was very flavorful.  The Calamari was so crispy and non-greasy, tender on the inside and lots of tentacles.  The actual size of the Calamari was on the smaller side (not the portion) which was interesting, because I never really saw Calamari that small, but it packed a lot of flavor.  The sauce it came with says \"home-made\" and it was like a sriracha spicy type concoction.  The Vegetable egg rolls came with a sweeter sauce, and also very flavorful and overall delicious appetizer.  I could have left happy at this point.  For Entrees, we ordered Tofu Panang Curry, Shrimp Red Curry, Shrimp Pad Thai, Tofu Pad Thai, and Orange Chicken.  The food came out shortly after the appetizers, and was phenomenal.  I tried everything but the Orange Chicken (tried the sauce which was good).  The Panang Curry was my favorite, as this has become my staple when ordering Thai, and they did not disappoint.  Very Flavorful, as was the Red Curry.  Both Pad Thai dishes also very good.  Fried Tofu was nice and crispy, soft on the inside, and the Shrimp was not overcooked whatsoever.  The entire family enjoyed everything, and the staff certainly made us feel welcomed.  As I mentioned, we came early, and very little other patrons at the time, so we got excellent service.  They were not on top of us either, which is always a big no-no for me.    The price was definitely appropriate based on the portion sizes, and no complaints at all in that department.  If we lived close to this place, we would definitely be regulars, without a doubt.  I hope to be back in town, and will certainly come back and check them out again.  Definitely stop by this place if you are in the area, for great service and exquisite Thai cuisine.",

    "text": "So after having lunch with few foodie/yelpers up the road at Flock & Fowl. We decided get some dessert. Thankfully I was just playing follow the leader. I would never think about Arawan Thai Bistro and Desserts. Thai restaurant just for DESSERTS!!! Really??? Not that never had my share of Thai restaurants in life. But am usually full by time get to desserts and the only that thing comes to mind is mango sticky rice. I know so lame. Anyway Arawan Thai Bistro and Desserts can totally understand why there the whole \"and Desserts\" in the name. Dam. Just the presentations on every desserts was really fine dining and desserts see in high end restaurants on the strip. The details and really each dessert was artwork. Most of the dishes had height, different textures, and not just one, two or three things but multiple ingredients going on in each dessert. At the same time all the ingredients worked together. I loved the fact they even got these chocolate square pieces with the restaurant logo on most of the desserts.   Five of us so talk about taking down dessert menu. I believe we only missed two. We ordered the Coconut Treasure, Mango Island, Chocolate Lava Cake, Thai Ice Cream with crepe something, and Chocolate with Raspberry sauce that made for one epic presentation at the table. The Mango Island was the one that stood out for me. It probably had the most stuff going on out of all the dishes. The rice at the bottom of the glass. Not sure the type but it was green in color. I never seen that color sticky rice before. Always been fan of fresh mango with sticky rice. This green stuff was amazing. The Chocolate once pour the hot raspberry sauce on top. I swear felt like watching Aliens and the suspense what hidden treasure is inside. Inside fresh raspberry with more sauce and other stuff. It super sweet. Thai Ice cream. I could have big scoop of that by itself be in heaven. The crepe was solid but that Thai Ice Cream really stood out. Not bad dessert tasted. The best thing is talk about reasonable price. All the desserts was under $15. I swear once see the time they put into making each one (dessert open kitchen can watch them if want) and when get it thinking not cheap dessert. I very impressed. This was my first time coming to Arawan Thai Bistro and Dessert.  Another thing where else can you go for sit down desserts but not just run of the mill ordinary ones but fancy ones middle of the day. Now I know and am sure will be back cause if the menu anything like the desserts. Oh yay!!!!",

We four shared the pad thai, fried rice, duck curry, fried ribs, and the larb.  Everything, and I mean everything was delicious.  We cleaned our plates and were completely, happily satiated.  If you've never tried larb, try it.  You'll be pleasantly surprised!    Oh, and the ice coffee.  Order the ice coffee.  Heaven in a glass.    Can't wait to go back one day!",

All the ingredients harmonized together so well!! My wife got the seafood pad thai wow it was extremely good!! I would say this place has the best pad thai in vegas. That's saying a lot with how many places I've tried. Their customer service is always great! Our glasses were never empty. The waiter was always on top of his service!! Come check this place out guys it's awesome!!",

The short ribs are fall off the bone juicy and the curry is the perfect mix of sweetness, texture, and flavor. This is one of my favorite Thai restaurants in town in large part fue to their amazing service. Our server was kind and attentive making sure to recommend their signature dishes. We also tried the spicy mint eggplant dish and it blew me away. What a delicious side, lucky for me it wasn't  too spicy because I can hardly handle the heat haha! We ended the night with their signature dessert, a delicious mango sorbet sticky rice combo with coconut milk drizzle served in a glass. Make sure to call in reservations because this place is small and intimate. You will love it!   Went in to have dinner with my best friend and we were so pleasantly surprised at how great this place was! It was so clean and modern, but also welcoming and organized. The food was delicious, everything we ordered was great, especially the yellow curry! Our servers were attentive and kind as well as very friendly. It's a smaller place and might require reservations on busy nights but we would definitely go back. Oh and their plating is amazing, all the food was so beautiful to look at!",

Arawan is very clean, comfortable, quiet, and it has the perfect ambiance for a nice relaxing dinner.   The food was excellent. We got the lemongrass chicken wings as an appetizer. They were very flavorful and cooked perfectly. Then, I ordered the red chicken curry along with the orange chicken plate (I was hungry) Both were fantastic. What I love about the food is that it is extremely flavorful, yet pretty light. Despite how much I ate, I did not feel sluggish.   Lastly, the customer service was top notch. I don't recall our waitress' name, but her cadence with checking up on us was perfect. She was very friendly and genuine.   Whether you're looking for a new place for a romantic date, or you're a foodie looking to try some great food, this is definitely a place you want to try.",

We had yellow chicken curry and it was magnificent. Followed With Pad Thai unlike anything I've ever seen or tasted. And prior to that we had some spring rolls which were super fresh and delicious. Like all the reviews before said it is in a strip mall and if you didn't know what was behind the door you wouldn't come in. Once you come in the restaurant is clean and attractive and the service was perfect.",

I have been a huge fan of Arawan Thai Bistro and Dessert for some time now, but after enjoying their lunch specials with one of my absolute favorite people in the world, I sat myself down to write this well deserving review.  $9.95 gets you        Soup       Salad       Entree       Dessert        Fruit infused water with ice  We ordered Yellow Curry and Pad See Ew with Chicken. The soup of the day was egg drop soup with thin crackers...it was well balanced in flavor and lacked any of the raw after taste that often comes with egg drop soup. The salad was made with mixed spring vegetables and a light ginger dressing. The Yellow Curry is served with steamed white rice--it has potatoes and carrots that my lunch date loves. The Pad See Ew is made with stir fried flat rice noodle, Chinese broccoli, and egg...and to top it off, they served us both a small strawberry pie...almost like puff pastry. I routinely enjoy a bite of a shared dessert after dinner at Arawan, but these were the perfect size, with just enough sweetness to finish our meal perfectly.  Service is always wonderful. For example, our water was filled as often as needed, without asking, and the green tea we ordered came dressed in style with a timer, honey, and slices of lemon.  Thank you chefs and staff at Arawan for having such a elegant service and satisfying lunch meal for $9.95...Vegas has lots of great options for all types of cuisines, at a variety of price ranges, but Arawan's lunch stands out for us both!  Arawan is also a favorite option for dinner. They offer traditional Thai dishes as well as refined Arawan Special dishes that are more sophisticated than any other Thai options in town.  -2017 Review #16-",

However, we arrived earlier than expected and the restaurant was able to get us seated and served earlier! Both the service and food were great!  I had the Arawan Pad Thai, one of their signature dishes. The presentation of the dish was stunning and the dish itself was delicious! The shrimp were a unique twist to traditional pad thai and worked surprisingly well with the sweet and savory noodles. Best pad thai I've had.  The rest of my family had a Ribeye Crispy Basil, Thai Spiced Sea Bass, and Panang Curry with Chicken. I tried their dishes as well, and everything was very tasty.",

The outside is a little bit of a turnoff, in my opinion, very crowded with posters at the door.   Once inside, it's clean, very well spaced out and (did I mention?) CLEAN! Excellent service, excellent food.   Wait staff comes over and keeps drinks refilled, picks up plates, brings extra napkins and more. All  without asking. Very impressive service.

I found Arawan from Yelp and it's located in the same plaza. All the reviews say it's comparable... it's not.  It is totally smaller and accommodates maybe 50 people at max. Outside the restaurant there are delicious pictures of desserts, so I was happy we lucked out. False, they give you a basic dessert menu which does not include any of their featured pictures. When I walked up to the dessert bar, they had some fried banana dessert, but the waitress said they are only serving the menu items... THEN WHY EVEN PUT IT OUT :insert mad face:  Breakdown:  Lemongrass Wings - overcooked and barely any meat; bad Yellow Curry with Short Rib - curry delicious, short rib too fatty; okay Pad Thai Special - $22 for 2 prawns and tasteless noodles; super bad Thai Tea - large portion; good   If you're going here for Thai food, it's alright. If you're going here because Lotus is full, you will definitely be disappointed.",

Arawan is a little more intimate and quieter, and service is a little better as well. The food is delicious and a little more elevated.

It's in a very unassuming location but its actually nice inside and service is top notch. The dishes are creative but still very thai. I've liked everything I've tried here. It's such a good price too for what you're getting! This is more of a sit down and enjoy thai restaurant as opposed to a quick take out place. The dishes are presented beautifully.   For starters - thai lemongrass chicken wings and ahi tuna larb. The tuna was fresh and has a lot of citrus. Chicken wings were amazing. I would order both of these again. For entrees- garlic short ribs and duck red curry. The short ribs melt in your mouth and the curry was tasty - I never would've thought to put grapes in it but it just works. As much as I liked everything, dessert is the BEST part. YOU CANNOT SKIP DESSERT and you have to order the mango island.",

They have a nice modern decor and the service was quick and friendly.   None of the food we had was bad but none of it was that memorable either.   I will say that the desserts were excellent!   I had the mango island and I think it might be one of the best desserts I've had out in quite some time.   Very balanced and just the right amount of sweet.",

I opted for the chicken panang curry. The flavors were alllll there & it was so spot on. I don't remember which spice level I got (probably 4/5) but I just remember the curry being super delicious!! The plate also comes with soup & a dessert. I'm pretty sure everything was under $10 - amazing food & great prices!! The soup wasn't bland - pretty flavorful. The dessert was some sort of cake topped with a scoop of ice cream - yummy!!   The service here is impeccable! The servers made sure my water was topped off & always asked if i was doing okay, not in an annoying way though. I will definitely be back!",

It's surrounded by weird looking businesses around (especially night time) but there are also some great cuisines such as Lotus Siam.   We went here to lunch. Great lunch special menu. $10 comes with soup, entree and desert. The place had a beautiful and elegant ambiance. It was clean and great service. To start, we got a smal bowl vegetable soup eith a clear broth. Then here come a toothsome Pad See Ew, the main entree. The noodle was perfectly cooked. Unlike some places where they over cooked the noodle or put too much sauce, this one was right on spot. The best part was desert. The lunch came with a yogurt panna cotta. Delicious. Second course of desert, of course we had to try the vanilla bean creme brulee! It was homemade from scratch and you can watch the whole process. Pretty neat and it was so tasty.   Overall, great lunch spot. This is also a perfect spot for vegetarians, great variety of vegetarians options. For dinner, they have variety of unique seafood and fish dishes. Definitely will come back and try them next time.",

    "text": "Wow. A friend of mine brought me here for lunch and I'm way impressed. I really like that that both chefs are women. I just love to support women business owners. As we were driving to this complex, I assumed she was taking me to Komol. I love Komol, which is located next door. I'm not exactly sure why this plaza has three thai restaurants but these two are delicious.  This place is very modern and trendy. Cute decor, but the food is top notch as well as the service. Highly recommend. We ordered a bunch of stuff to share. My friend loves the Thai Tea, but I just had regular iced tea. For lunch we had the short rib with yellow curry. The meat was perfectly tender and you could easily pull it apart with your fork. The curry was very flavorful. Great dish. The spicy green beans had great texture. I know we also ordered a chicken dish, but for the life of me I can't remember which one. I do remember that the sauce was really good. Actually, everything was so good that I wanted to eat more, but I was stuffed.  I especially like that they never add msg and use quality ingredients. Prices are competitive and completely worth it for the taste. Great restaurant. They have vegan and vegetarian options - obviously that isn't something I require, but I appreciate because I have a fair amount of veggie/vegan friends. It makes it easier to know I can bring them without issue.  Now I have a decision to make the next time I want Thai - both Komol and Arawan are so good. It's going to be a tough choice :)",

    "text": "Came here for dinner with good company last night. I have been to many Thai restaurants (I love Thai food more than Japanese or Korean food) and this is the best Thai restaurant you'll find in town.   We started off with their honeydew sencha tea then ordered chicken satay bites as our appetizer & crab fried rice , ribeye crispy basil , arawan pad thai , and duck red curry (all from their signature menu) for entrees. Food can be spicier but overall everything was amazing. Even my boyfriend said their Thai food is the best compared to the other Thai restaurants we've been to in Las Vegas. He really enjoyed the duck red curry and I loved the ribeye crispy basil. The sliced ribeye was perfect along with the crispy basil , mushrooms , bell peppers , garlic , and chili. I also loved how the arawan pad thai is wrapped in a egg netting - very different from standard pad thai. It's served w/ chicken inside and two prawns on top. I highly recommend getting any of their signature dishes when dining here.   Don't skip out on their desserts too - we actually ordered more desserts than entrees. We got their vanilla bean creme brulee , mango island , raspberry chocolate lava cake , affogato and sweet sensation. All are made to order just like their dinner & you can watch the chef make it from their dessert bar. I'm not really a fan of fruity desserts but their mango island was my absolutely favorite here. They put their homemade mango gelato on top of sticky rice and it has crunchy almonds , crispy waffle , and mangoes inside a wine glass & you pour a creamy coconut sauce allover it. You can't go wrong with any of them (although I would recommend ordering more than one dessert because they're all so good) but their mango island is a must order. Again , I love how different it is from your standard mango with sticky rice dessert you can get from other Thai places.  I must also mention the presentation from their ambiance and decor to the food and desserts here are all really nice. Our server Kanni was very hospitable and accommodating. This place is not too far from the Strip and downtown area :)",

I came here for dinner with a couple of friends. We ordered individual dishes and they all were brought out in a timely fashion. For appetizers, they brought out some wonton chips and a sweet/spicy dipping sauce. Delicious! We also ordered the Tom Kah Chicken soup, which was sour enough from the lemongrass to tease our taste buds.  I ordered the Crispy Pork Belly with Chinese Broccoli. OMG. So good! The bite-size pieces of fatty pork were seasoned well and the acidity of the Chinese broccoli was a nice balance to the overall saltiness. I would definitely order this again or even take it to go after trying something else!  My friends ordered the Garlic Short Ribs and the Short Rib Yellow Curry. The Garlic Short Ribs were good. You might want to use your fingers to get all the meat off the bones. Personally, they were probably cooked a minute too long as they were a little too chewy for my taste. The Short Rib Yellow Curry was also good. As they set the plate down, the huge rib of meat jiggled and glistened in the light and I could tell it was perfectly cooked. And it was! The curry itself was also tasty. No complaints here.  The desserts probably stole the show. We ordered the Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee and the Earthquake. The Earthquake was fun. You pour the hot raspberry sauce over the chocolate ball. As the chocolate melts, the lychee sorbet inside is slowly revealed. The sorbet was good, but probably too sweet for my taste and a bit too tart. The creme brulee was yummy! Order one of your own and don't share! This one is beautifully plated. The candied sugar cage will crumble as you give it a light tap with your spoon. The crust on the creme brulee was perfect and nothing was too sweet.  Everything about this visit was pleasant, except for the point lighting, which I thought was too harsh at times. It was difficult getting the right picture as my own shadow would cast too harshly over the food. There are lots of dishes to choose from and I will definitely be back to try more! I noticed the family next to us ordered a whole catfish that looked delicious. Maybe I'll try that next!",

    "text": "I found Arawan through Yelp when searching for a dinner and dessert restaurant. I have mixed feelings about the place.  First, I'll start off with the restaurant itself. From the outside, I personally get a food truck kind of feel from the place. They have pictures of their dishes plastered on the outside, which is nice because then you know exactly what you're getting. We were surprised upon entering the restaurant: it's beautiful! They have a modern chic style going on. The seats were comfortable and the decor was nice to look at. It's just a little deceiving from the outside because I wanted to have a cool dinner with my friends, but I felt like I was on a fancy date.   Secondly, the service. I believe there is such thing as too much service, and I got too much service here and it wasn't good. I know I might have been taking awhile to look over the menu, but three different employees came up to my table within a 5-minute period to ask if everything was okay. At one point, it was very awkward and uncomfortable. I felt like I would be kicked out if I didn't make a decision on the spot.  Lastly, I'll talk about the food: The menu is split into different categories and the portion sizes are all over the place. I ordered an orange chicken plate and my friend had the pad thai special. Both of our portions were fairly large, so there were no complaints from our end, but I just found it odd because I was expecting that my friend would have a bigger portion than mine since she was paying almost double for her selection. My husband ordered the red duck curry and he had a little portion which was made worse by the fact that it was served in a bowl with a large rim. It looked tiny. I wish I could have gotten a photo of the disappointment on his face. It's all about presentation, and the presentation of the curry was lacking. Aside from that, the flavors were not lacking. Everyone was satisfied with how the food tasted. We decided to try their dessert since that was one of the main reasons we came down there. Their dessert is amazing! We ordered the vanilla bean creme brulee and the earthquake. The presentation is beautiful and the desserts were not too sweet: they were the perfect ending to our meal.  I love Thai food, so I'm always up to trying new places. Although this restaurant is beautiful and the food tasted good, it just left me feeling very confused. I feel like the restaurant is trying too hard. I'll skip on it this place next time. There are better and cheaper thai places in the valley.",

    "text": "I love Thai food and have a favorite place near Cleveland that makes many great dishes. One of my favors green Curry with squid or scallops. At Arawan I had the best green curry and scallops ever!  Presented like art, delicious, fine service from Eck, our waiter. Others loved the pad Thai - all dishes were excellent. Appetizers were good - but the meals were for sure the highlight. Desert of coconut ice cream with sticky rice was also very good. It's in an old strip mall that is behind a complex closed down strip so you can't see it from the street. But there are other stores and it didn't seem anything to worry about as far as safety.  Pricing is fair and a bargain compared to anything on the strip. If you like Thai - don't miss Arawan.",

The price is on the higher scale of what you would typically pay for a mid gourmet Thai food but it's you really get what you pay for. Something this good speaks for itself so I'll end my review with, this is by far the BEST Thai restaurant in town.",

I'm pretty disappointed but what can I do you have to try out new restaurants to see what's out there. So we ordered our standard Thai dishes which was the typical pad Se ewe, wings, and yellow curry. I mean you def can't go wrong with those dishes. But no, I was wrong. The pad Se ewe lacked in flavor. Very Bland... The curry was okay it needed a kick. And the white rice was so soggy!! Who wants to eat soggy rice with their dishes?? I sure don't. It messes the whole dish up.  The wings were the best actually. Another thing that made me disappointed, was one of our servers. I received a bit of an attitude requesting a spice rack. It was surprising to me because we were the only ones at the restaurant.",

    "text": "Arawan was legitimately impressive and in my opinion, absolutely worth the trip off the strip. The food is pretty close to one star Michelin level for a very reasonable. price. Give the pad thai and earthquake dessert a try.   The restaurant is located in a sketchy, unassuming strip mall area. I visited on a Saturday morning and the parking lot was pretty abandoned. It was kind of hard to find because the sign wasn't very conspicuous.   The interior of the place is pleasant and minimalist. My group of 14 put in orders and the food came out pretty quickly. I ordered the Pad Thai, which was very interestingly made. It was contained in an egg webbing that held the noodles in a flattened ball state. I've never seen anything like it.   The flavors of the food was excellent. As someone who spent 3 weeks in Thailand constantly eating Pad Thai, I was impressed by the sweetness and spicy kick.   Dessert is where Arawan really shined. I ordered the earthquake, which was basically lime sherbet with chocolate. The twist is that the chocolate is molded into a ball with the sherbet nestled inside. The dish also came up warm raspberry sauce that's meant to be poured onto the chocolate ball to get in the middle. The dish is elegantly crafted, well plated, and fun on execution. I've really only seen this level of creativity and craftsmanship at MIchelin level restaurants.  Finally, we visited for my girlfriend's birthday. Arawan gave us a nice ice cream dessert plate with Thai iced tea ice cream and happy birthday elegantly written in cursive.  Give Arawan a visit - it ranks better than Star of Siam in my book.",

The food took forever and there was no follow up with how our food was tasting.  We came here because Lotus of Siam had a long wait. This place obviously rides off the leftover business from there.  My recommendation is just stay there and wait for good food.   One star for just flat out ripping people off and not providing any quality food whatsoever",

What I had was good, and I don't do desserts and those might also be very good but were untested. It has a nice decor, which others mention, but I wasn't going for ambiance, rather, good food in wide variety. The variety isn't as good as other places, and if you're vegetarian or close, you won't find much to your liking. Appetizers might be really good, but they're priced just below what I would expect for entres at other Thai restaurants where I've dined.  Service is also slower, and isn't as attentive as other places, too. Overall: good food, not stellar, at above average prices. Probably not going to go again.",

If you love Thai food you would do well to experience all three of these. The best? Today I'm thinking Arawan, but I definitely want to do more experimentation. Big smiles. UPDATE:  I went back and re-read my reviews of the other two restaurants, which reminded me of some important factors. Although Yelp gives all three restaurants two $$'s for pricing, Lotus of Siam has increased their prices and I think it should be three $$$'s now. And although  the food at Komol is equally good IMHO,  The day I was there there was no music and the service was extremely slow. Therefore... Arawan is truly the best.",

Instead what they did was take our food that was already packed into go Packaging and took it to the back for about 3 minutes.

You barely get to go to a restaurant and order a bunch of stuff and have it all consistently good from appetizers to dessert. Well, this is one of them. Our party was big, so we pretty much got to try almost everything on the menu. Everything was just perfectly cooked and flavorful, there's literally nothing bad we could say about our experience here that night. There's a dessert bar right next to where we were sitting, the whole idea of being able to see how your desserts were made was great but the fact that they were so diligently placing each item in the glass was a treat to see. This place definitely became our must visit Thai restaurant whenever we're in vegas. Asked the owner/manager to open one in LA and he politely smiled. I really hope they do.",

Since Lotus was closed yesterday at 4, we came here. It's fantastic!  We had the Tom Kha, which frankly, was better than at Lotus, with the inclusion of cabbage and just had a lovely broth.  My other half had Pad Thai with the giant shrimp with the legs on them still and their little bodies intact, which isn't my thing, but he assured me it was tasty. The rest of the dish was great.  I had the yellow curry.  It was good. I wouldn't call it spectacular, but I was already full from everything else.     Service excellent.   The only recommendation I would give to the restaurant owner is.... the lighting is TERRIBLE!  Overhead lights are the worst lights you can possibly have. Everyone looks bad, with shadows on their face. Even my other half agreed and he would rarely even notice. The ceiling can lights are very high up, and basically your dining partner looks like they are being interrogated at a crime lab. \"where were you on the night of January 10th?\" sort of thing.  Turn off those terrible lights and put candles on the table. That's all you need. Ambiance!  I would highly recommend this for great Thai food.",

    "text": "What a great find. Coming from San Francisco we are well acquainted with great Thai food, but this place blew us away.  It's a little off the strip, so has the added benefit of more reasonable prices, but the food is world class Thai.  We had the squid-ink seafood drunken noodles, which were amazing and just the right level of spicy, and the Gai Yang chicken which was grilled to perfection.  They are also known for their deserts. We had the Chocolate Caramel Pecan Tart which was amazing. Highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for great Thai in Vegas.",

Very impressive. Nice decor too... The food was excellent. We ordered the beef panang and chicken yellow curry. Excellent.  Meat was soft, cooked very well and curry flavor to die for. The rice was  extremely  moist which is what I liked the best.  If you get a chance say Hi to their pastry chef Gail. The coconut icecream is the best one I have had so far.   I am definitely  going back to try their other dishes. A new jewel in the crown!",

    "text": "It's Father's Day, we happen to be in Las Vegas. I'm dad so I get to pick my cuisine, Thai, of course. But where to go? After an Internet search, I  Arawan Thai Bistro & Dessert. After finding the place in what might have been a strip mall (not to be confused with a LV stripper), I was a little bit apprehensive given the very unassuming store front. We entered anyway and found a most excellent ambiance inside, and a very friendly waitstaff. We had some typical appetizers, chicken satay and spring rolls. The chicken satay was chicken satay. I think it is difficult to mess up chicken satay. It is like ordering a fried egg for breakfast. But the spring roll, called an Arawan fresh roll was just about the best I have had. The greens were so fresh, they were crisp; a most excellent start to what continued to build.     For dinner we had beef pad see ew, squid-ink drunken noodles, Thai-spiced sea bass and duck red curry, all excellent. And the presentation was so excellent my wife did not want to disturb it with her fork.    But then dessert!? Who would have thought such exquisite dessert could be found in a place like this? We ended with a Mango Island, a Coconut Treasure, a Sweet Sensation and the Father's Day Special. Once again, the presentation was superb, even artistic.    A most excellent find!",

For entrees we had the short rib yellow curry, the rib eye and the pad thai. We only ordered the pad thai because fellow yelpers recommended it. However, that is the one dish that we could have passed on. It has a beautiful presentation, but at the end of the day, it's just ordinary, gummy pad thai. The short rib and the rib eye was so amazing, however, that we're still craving more! My dining companion ordered the mango island for dessert and loved it. We'll be back!",

Also, the portion sizes are inadequate, given what they charge, particularly the desserts. Service needs some work too. The hostess (and probably owner?) is proactive and responsive (she's the one who convinced us to come inside), but the rest of the staff is not adequately trained. One of the servers spilled some food on my husband, the waitress didn't seem to understand our requested spiciness level and multiple servers tried to take away dishes and utensils we were still using.  I really wanted to like the place but I will not be returning.",

We ordered  -Chicken Panang  -Thai fried rice -Chicken satay  -Lemongrass chicken wings -mint chicken -pad Thai  Our favorites were the Pad Thai, the curry, and satay. They were super flavorful and the chicken quality is 10/10 it was so tender. They also use fresh lemongrass, basil. The leftovers were soooo good.   All in all the food was amazing and the atmosphere is super nice this wouldn't be a place that I would go consistently just because it was expensive but definitely would come by on special occasions.",

Facility: This place is pretty nice. It has a very upscale feel with beautiful tables and chairs and elegant decor. I loved they had a different fresh flower on every table. This would be a great date night restaurant.   Service:  The service was very good here. Fairly attentive and when we asked for a big portion to go of what was left on our plates, they came out to find out if there was a problem with the food so they could \"improve\" anything. I like that. :)  Food: They serve a slice of strawberry in the very elegant water glass, which I thought classed it up.  We ordered the lunch deals, which is a choice of a main dish, rice on the side, soup, and a dessert for $9.99.  The soup was an egg drop soup 3/5 with some fried noodles to drop in. Something was a tad sweet, which I threw it off for me. I think it was the noodles.  My main dish was the Chicken Pad See Ew 4/5. It had a good flavor, but it was a tad mushy. The spice level I asked for the spiciest, and it was more like a med spice.  For dessert, they bring a slice of blueberry cheesecake 4/5. I was too full, but took one bite to taste and it was very good.   Overall:  I liked this place. Great atmosphere!!!  The food was good, but I'd like to come back for dinner and try something else. For the record, I like this better than the Thai neighbors in commercial center ... K and LOS. ;)",

I really enjoyed the cute tables. Our seats had individual cushions that made my back feel well-supported after a long day.  The food was way better than I expected even after the reviews. The only reason I did not give 5 stars was that they did not ask how spicy we wanted our food. My yellow Thai curry could have been a little spicier and my boyfriend's pad see ew was so spicy I couldn't eat it. We usually share our dishes so I was a little disappointed.  If they start inquiring about the \"spicy\" level and augment the food appropriately, they will take their food to the next level!",

My cucumber salad was tangy and fresh, my yellow curry warm and savory. I had a coconut dessert that hit just the right mark.

Not to be deterred from our mission for delicious Thai food, we found Arawan in the same plaza and were intrigued by the rave reviews.  Arawan has excellent atmosphere. When we went for a 12:30PM Sunday lunch, it was quiet, with big comfy chairs and natural lighting. Service was attentive and friendly.  The menu has just enough of just the right kind of options - some classic Thai dishes as well as house specialties. They offer some really delicious sounding entrees (squid ink pad thai? yes please) that are a bit more spendy, but most of the basics were $10-12.  They were happy to accommodate my request for a peanut-free, tofu-veggie pad thai. When it came out, I was surprised at the beautiful, thoughtful presentation - not what I expected for a $10 dish! As I dug in, the flavors and quality of the food were similarly impressive. Some Thai places' fried noodle dishes have indistinguishable, muddy flavors - but Arawan's was bright and clear. I could taste the tamarind, chiles (spice level = just right), and other ingredients clearly - and it was a whole new experience. My husband similarly enjoyed his yellow curry.  We left happy and stuffed, and will definitely return next time we're in town.",

    "text": "Food is excellent, portions are bistro-style... so you won't get stuffed, unless you decide to try 3 plates each (like we did).  Another reviewer mentioned this isn't a family joint, and I agree. Between the 4 of us, we ordered lots of stuff, and expected to share. Unless you've got a table reserved in the group side of the house, your table will be tiny, and the wait staff won't consider reseating you. So ask for this feature in advance if you wanna do some family style sharing.  Prices were reasonable for the quality being served, but I found some of the little things just plain stingy. Small stuff should be comped. It's America. We don't expect the world, but we do judge when owners are cheap. Example: we took our 8 year old to this joint. I ordered him bowl of white rice, and asked for the most bland-tasting chicken they can make him. But these jokers are like $2 for the \"borr of white rice, and you *have* to order this BBQ chicken dish for $15 darra.\" I'm like, \"you guys microwave the BBQ chicken dish, or does the chicken have to be cooked first?\" And they're like, \"Jimmy crack corn, you gotta buy this BBQ dish for $15 darra.\" (or whatever the Thai version of my Chinese racism sounds like).  Bottom line: good for dates, order everything on the menu that sounds good to you (it's all delicious), come in for lunch to save a couple bucks, come in for dessert on a separate occasion with **really** nice bottles of your own wine (corkage fee is $15 darra per bottle), call in advance to reserve big tables for family-style dining.",

This restaurant is a great place to go for lunch or dinner. The presentation of the food and dessert is beautiful, looks like a piece of art, and the taste is great. Also, the people there are very nice and friendly.  If you're ever in Vegas, this is definitely the place to go to.",

    "text": "Yes, they have a high review rating on Yelp. Yes, their food is good and presentation of dishes and overall atmosphere are more on the fancy side. Yes, this place will probably always be busy with customers and continue to receive accolades. However, my one experience at this place, which was over a four-person dinner reservation on a summer Friday evening while I was in town for the weekend, was less positive than expected. Let me explain why.   First of all, our server was rude. Not in an overt way, but rather in the manner of her being too overbearing and inconsiderate. After showing us to our table, she began explaining the menu before we all had a chance to sit down, and she even blocked my one friend from getting to her seat, so my friend ended up just going to the bathroom first. On top of that, the server then prematurely came back to take our drink/appetizer order before my friend had returned to the table and sat down--meaning, she hadn't even had a chance to look at the menu yet! To me, this constitutes as rude practice, and that right there had set the negative tone for me. After that, the same server, on several occasions, kept reaching over me and did not allow appropriate space between herself and our table. Also, why do servers/wait staff always want to take our plates away before we are thoroughly done with each dish??!!? On multiple occasions, our server, as well as another wait staff, had tried to reach over our table to take serving plates away, WITHOUT even asking if we were done with them....even my soup cup, which clearly had a good portion of soup left in it, was fair game to them. This is NOT okay, Arawan... Take note!!!!! This is a huge pet peeve for many of us diners, and it's annoying to me no matter the kind of establishment or how fancy the restaurant is.  Although we were satisfied with the food that we ordered, it's highly likely that I, personally speaking, will never return. It's a shame too, because there were quite a few dishes that I would have liked to try. But aside from the less-than-quality service that I experienced, it should also be noted that their prices are more on the expensive end of Thai cuisine. I feel that these combined reasons justify my low rating here. For me, the poor service experience trumped the food, and especially at those prices. Why would I pay more money for really the same quality of food that I can get elsewhere and with better service?",
