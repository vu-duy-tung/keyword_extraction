    "text": "Although quite expensive, the Eiffel Tower Restaurant is a must see to anyone visiting Las Vegas on vacation. Just make sure to request a window seat and you will have some of the best views of the strip around! Accompanied by a lovely Parisian ambiance and phenomenal food. The foie gras appetizers are to die for and I had the best lamb chops of my life there as well! My boyfriend got the chocolate tasting dessert, which was superb as well! The service was great, as to be expected at an authentic French restaurant. They were definitely a bit over the top but not too in your face. I've heard it's amazing for lunch as well. My table directly overlooked the Bellagio fountains so we got to watch many, many shows! They were also very respectful of our schedule since we had theater that we needed to make it to.",

The Eiffel Tower was incredible. We didn't have a reservation but had no problem getting a table. It was so nice to find a place that actually sticks to it's dress code. I hate being the only patrons dressed appropriately in an upscale restaurant. We were seated close to the window so we could see the fountains. It's actually pretty brilliant the way the dining room is laid out so everyone can get some sort of view.  Anyway, we started with the sea scallops which were divine! Cooked to perfection, melted in your mouth- but you are only paying for 2 so be aware.  Our server made great recommendations. My bf had the halibut and could not stop raving about the flavor! I had the red snapper and it was brilliant! I wanted to order more! Unfortunately the portions are a bit small for my taste but that was to be expected. And now comes the best part of the meal....They have like 5 or 6 types of souffle! We opted for the pistachio souffle and I kid you not, IT WAS THE BEST THING I HAVE EVER PUT IN MY MOUTH!  Yes, this place is pricey but worth every penny! The service was great, the food was wonderful and the view unmatched. I recommend going around sunset and watch the strip come to life!",

I haven't had their food but in order to take advantage of the view, just come up around 9:30pm for their famous chocolate souffle ($15) and a view of the bellagio fountain and the strip that you will never forget.    I can't imagine a better dessert...it was so warm, fluffy, light yet hitting all your sweet spots...gosh, one of the best desserts I've ever had in my lifetime.  I personally thing this was the best $15 I spent at Vegas.  Usually, Vegas wins....this time, I finally won....=)",

My boyfriend and I were as nice as possible to him despite the negative vibe we were getting.  By the end of our meal, I think he felt guilty and his mood changed drastically.    It was just the 2 of us so our view was right in front of the Bellagio fountain show.  We got to watch at least 4 water shows.  I absolutely loved it!!  Our meals were mediocre - nothing to rave about although it was good but hands down to the souffle!!  We had the chocolate one and my goodness... we certainly devoured it.    Definitely recommended... I'm only giving 4 stars out of 5 because of the food and slightly because of the service from our waiter.  I'm a fan because of the dessert and the view!",

    "text": "Wow, so let me start by saying that I was invited here by a friend of mine's parents. They are typically high rollers and like to spend a lot when they are in Vegas. I try to translate expensive things with good quality, but unfortunately that was not the case here. Our party had 7 people total...   Good news first: ~Beautiful view of the Bellagio water show ~the Souffles ($10) are yummy (chocolate and grand marnier) ~escargot appetizer (~$13) - decent size and good ~foie gras appetizer (~$14)- foie gras was ok, but the fig chutney was delicious ~stuffed rabbit entree ($45) - my friends 12 year old ordered it and said it tasted like chicken (to him, delicious!)  Bad news (here is the list of food ordered and the qualitative comments): ~grilled asparagus ($9) - DISGUSTING. mushy, STEAMED not grilled, and covered with a HARD BOILED EGG CRUMBLE (WTF?!?!?) ~potato fritters ($9) - pretty cool concept. they came out looking like mozzarella sticks, but no cheese inside, just mashed potato stuff. first bite was delicious then I quickly realized how ridiculously salty they were, and ate 2 out of a 9 or 10 piece order ~surf n turf ($50) - the new york strip was the size of a filet mignon without the girth, and the piece of fish was cooked OK but also smaller than a small box of chicken nuggets from McDonalds ~halibut ($40) - tiny portion but tasted ok  I forgot the other dishes, but to top off the shitty food, our reservation was for 7:30pm and we didnt leave until after 11. almost 4 hours for 3 courses (appetizers, entrees, desserts)? I think that is a bit ridiculous. I have paid much less for much better food. if you have reservations, have some in-n-out first (that is where we ended up afterwards, LOL no joke)  btw - the bill at the end was $700 - 7 drinks (5 alcohol and 2 non), 2 appetizers, 6 entrees, 2 sides, 3 desserts.",

    "text": "\"That's it?\"   These words started - and ended - the night.  The first time it was said because I had a dumb moment. Stupid me thought the restaurant would be at the very top of the tower. I realized that wasn't True when the elevator ride up to the restaurant was all of 5 seconds. Kinda took the magic of Paris away.  What I was also hoping was that the food would be better. If it's any consolation, the escargot was great. It was my first time eating this dish, and I really enjoyed the textures that came through. Well done. The \"warm\" lobster salad came out COLD and it was also quite bland. It also was difficult to eat. Do NOT order it. The rest of our food was overcooked and overseasoned. My seabass was dry, and my boyfriend's ahi tuna was practically cooked all the way through. He wasn't too happy with this and even offered his two cents for my Yelp review (which he never usually does). Salvation came at the end of the meal in the form of creme brulee. At least the French really know their desserts. In spite of all this, the service was very attentive and superb. They deserved their tip that night.  My advice is that if the view of the strip and Bellagio fountain show really matter all that much to you, then go ahead and have dinner here. But if you really want the main event to be your food, take your money elsewhere.",

    "text": "Came here with five other people. We all enjoyed but were not blown away with the restaurant, so I gave it four stars.  Firstly, the view is beautiful. Maybe come here on one of your first nights in Las Vegas, especially if you are not staying in or near the Bellagio/Paris (we stayed in the Paris hotel). If you are always around the fountains, they do get old after awhile. But then again, it's a different, more grand vantage point to enjoy them from.  We didn't take advantage but if you have an early 5:00 pm dinner, they will seat you at a window immediately. This is probably because Las Vegas diners come out pretty late for dinner and dining rooms are pretty empty until 7 p.m. hits.  The service is not particularly friendly, but I'm never really impressed by overly enthusiastic waiters anyway, so that was fine by me. One exception was the server who came around with bread. He was so enthusiastic about his bread. Lol. Great guy.   My husband and I both had the filet mignon with truffle sauce. It arrived...warmish, not hot. We had to remind the server we also had the truffle sauce, which came in a separate sauce boat. It arrived after the reminder. And we also didn't get proper steak knifes, which took away from the experience a little bit.   The other people at the table liked their dishes, the bread, etc. My father in law ordered the veal medallions but a big hunk of lamb chop was placed in front of him. He alerted the server to the error but the server tried to pass off the lamb chop as \"better\" and acted surprised when my FIl still insisted on the veal medallions. That was odd. He later apologized for the mistake but it was still an odd way to handle the situation.  We ordered dessert souffles (caramel for hubby and I, strawberry for the other two couples) and it was a truly exceptional souffle which made up for the other mistakes at the meal. I would highly recommend!  The mistakes not withstanding, the restaurant is great for a romantic dinner. It could use a little more polish considering the pricing, but the ambiance makes up for all of that.",

We knew it was a fancier spot, but it's also Vegas, where just about anything goes, so we didn't think it was a big deal when my bf showed up with a nicer, non-collared shirt on.  We did find out they have loaner sport coats, how wonderful.  Even more wonderful was the fact that there were men at the bar with short sleeved Hawaiian shirts and fanny packs on, shorts & sandals...but they did all have collars, so there's that.  I think our waitress was either a burnout or a special child of God, because I've never had anyone so spacey get a couple of drinks for me.  She didn't know what bleu cheese olives were and when my bf asked for the \"same\" drink as me, she thought he said Sam?!? Not sure how that connects.  It became laughable at the end when we gave her a credit card to pay the outrageous tab ($60 for two martinis & two glasses of red wine) and she asked if we wanted change.  Good grief.",

The waiters were very pleasant, and we were both under the impression that everyone enjoyed working there.  We were seated by the window for an incredible view of the Bellagio fountains during sunset.  For food, we enjoyed the asparagus soup, the chicken, the Alaskan cod, and a chocolate hazelnut cake.  Our meals were very impressive and absolutely delectable.  The presentation was amazing, and we really appreciated and enjoyed the complimentary Happy Anniversary dessert that was brought to us.  We would definitely return, and I just wanted to reach out and say how commendable of a job our waiter Tony R. did to make us feel welcome.

I ordered the Prime Aged New York Strip cooked medium well (now, don't get on me for not getting it rare. I'm not a rare typa gal!) and it was cooked to perfection! Tender, still juicy, and scrumptious! My other half got the Broiled 22 oz. Bone-in Ribeye, Roasted Bone Marrow cooked medium rare. That was my first time tasting bone marrow... ehh. Not really my cup of tea, but it wasn't bad, I'll give you that. We got an order of mac-n-cheese to share. Mmmm! Perfect amount of cheese, a bit too filling, but then again, we DID order a good amount of delicious food.   We shared with our waiter that we were celebrating our anniversary. To our surprise, he brought out two chocolate mousse for our anni. He said, \"In France, it is tradition to eat this with your significant other on your anniversary.\" How sweet! On top of that, he talked us into trying one of their succulent souffles. I ordered creme brulee because my boyfriend can't resist creme brulee! Alll were soooo sooo BOMB! At the very end, he brought out chocolates.   Ahh! Perfect fine dining experience! Great view of the fountains, awesome food, unpredictable server! All the other wait staff were friendly and attentive as well.   FIVE STARS! Def worth what you're paying for!",

    "text": "We stumbled across this place for lunch by accident on our way to the pool and decided to take a gamble. We were quickly escorted to an elevator with great views. The elevator opens to the kitchen and we were quickly seated at a table facing the Bellagio fountains. Within 10 min of being seated the fountains started going and it was mesmerizing from this viewpoint. That alone made the meal worth it :) we ordered a few cocktails to start and I got the chicken salad. Service was impeccable and excellent. They even end the meal with complimentary small desserts to which we graciously accepted. Who would say no to this?? The complimentary bread was also delicious. I can definitely see how this turns into a much more upscale and potentially pretentious dining establishment in the evenings but it was perfect for a casual lunch. I was wearing a casual dress with a Jean jacket and definitely didn't feel judged negatively.",

    "text": "I got there with my girlfriend a week ago for my birthday celebration. Walked in and ordered 2 cocktails while being seated. Cocktail server was really attentive and recommended me what we would like to drink. After short minute, we were seated. Server introduced himself;forgot his name. And we asked for 2 cups of water, lemon on my girlfriend's. It wasnt really a busy day, but it looks like he forgot what we have requested, and we had to remind of him on our lemon. It took a while to get our orders too, we were sitting there for roughly 15 minutes without doing anything since we decided what we were going to eat. Okay, since it is my celebration day, I do not want to ruin it anyways. We ordered Newyork Strip Medium rare, Lobster as our main, Foie Gra with steak tartar as our appetizer. Food was cooked perfect and we really enjoyed eating food.  What i was frustrated was when we asked for the check and while server was taking care of the plate, he dropped some food on my girlfriend's dress. What's interesting was, even though it was his fault on dropping food on my girlfriend's dress, all he said is a one word, sorry. The way he said was too dry and I am not quite sure if he really meant it sincerely, but all he did was to say sorry and kept doing what he was doing. I am not going to lie, overall expression, it was good from start. It was just one server that I felt missing as upscale restaurant. Our check was around $300. I am not sure if I am going to come back, but if I do when one of my company is willing to pay, I will make sure I do not get the same server I previously got.",

Where can I even begin - first if I could give it a 7 I would! This was the finest meal, on all counts we had while in vegas on \"food crawl-2016 (c)\" seriously.  We started with the house champagne- very lovely.  That was followed immediately by a demitasse filled with a puree of savory onion and cream - they described it as a savory cream, very custard like for cleaning the palette.  From there we moved onto the cheese plate consisting of French cheeses, spiced Feuilletine, honeycomb and candied walnuts.  Next we moved to the Classic Escargot laBourguignne, garlic and parsley- so delicious and yes a puff pastry too.  From there we decently moved to the cold Foie Gras Torchon duck with fig compote and brioche.  Whew - after that we enjoyed some bits of candied fruits and chocolates.(think Turkish delight)  They honored us with a parfait of chocolate mousse- one of the lightest and most satisfying deserts I have ever enjoyed.  We enjoyed their special roast (coffee) - it reminded me of coffee I enjoyed in Chili.   The service now that's a whole other review - they were professional, prompt but in no way pushy. They maintained our water glasses and then would vanish. If the meal was not the most amazing ever the service pushed it it up to 7 stars.  Did I mention it was extremely affordable?  We strongly recommend the Effiel Tower and we give it Five out of five forks\"",

But anyway, they were able to change it on that day. The view was ok, we saw the musical fountain in front of Bellagio. But the food was nightmare. Smoked salmon was not really seasoned, it was just like a salted fish. Filet mignon was cooked like a piece of wood, and the cod was cooked with some weird curry sauce, which was way over salted. At last, the farewell dessert was terrible, over-sweetened and very oily. Defiantly not recommended, the food was overpriced for the awful taste. In-and-out burger might be a better choice. Sorry the steak was really bad, we didn't take photo of it.",

So perhaps my expectations of Las Vegas have been unreasonable... Perhaps I should expect that everything is simply a shell of good with a rotting egg inside? Okay, that is a bit harsh for this installment but truly, that is what I feel for the most part.   - Nothing at this location is organic but the pricing would mislead you to believe that they actually care about the quality of their products.  *ha*  - The staff is a bit haphazard as far as how they attend to your table. (I needed to ask three times for a cup of coffee... finally got an old brew that nearly tasted rancid. *joy*)   - I'm quite certain that the staff in all the Las Vegas restaurants are determined to say their fish is 'the freshest' when one can clearly taste it is not. (I cook and I'm from California... this fish does not make the grade and yet you still ask for the outlandish price. *tisk tisk* )  - The view is nice and though the old venue is kept up, it still just feels old.   Do not be bamboozled, come to terms with the fact that you are simply paying for the view and decently *presented* food and you're good.",

A typical drink will be around 20 dollars and even the Chicken entree was 40 dollars.   We also had the dover sole and the lamb chops which were all delicious.  The desert soufflets were really good as well and the ambience is quite nice.  Similar to Jules Verne in Paris Eiffel Tower.  Be prepared to spend at least 150 per head .",

You get to see a spectacular view of the strip, as well as the Bellagio water show from a view you can't beat, just incredible. There is no bar at the very top of the tower, but you are allowed to bring your drink with you and enjoy the view for as long as you want. FYI, there are no bathrooms at the top, but the elevator runs every 10 min.  Try it at night when all the light are on.",

    "text": "Mediocre at best. I expected much more from this restaurant based on the reviews. I was sorely disappointed, especially when the check came. To begin, the filet was overdone: we had to send it back. A restaurant of this caliber should be able to get a filet mignon cooked medium with no difficulty. Alas, that was not the case. Secondly, the individual beef wellington was also over-cooked and relatively flavorless. I did not send it back, however, because it takes 25-30 minutes to cook (perhaps that time should be reduced to 22-27 minutes!). The ($12) side of mushrooms was over-salted and could not be eaten on it's own.  \"Salt\" is not a flavor! Apparently, the management is counting on the view to justify the cost; sadly, it was not worth the $350 tab ($100 for a decent bottle of wine). This was for a party of two and no dessert. I will not be back.",

My girlfriend said Wellington was the eat thing she has ever had in her life.  Simply amazing and the view of the Bellagio fountains are really worth it.

    "text": "We made the same day reservation to this restaurant this week.  During the call to reserve our table, I mentioned that we would be coming back from Cirque De Soleil show, and requested a recommended seating time (taking traffic and transport on weekday evening into account).  Eventually, we settled for 9:15pm and we arrived on time. Our waiter was so awesome.  Though he wasn't the one answering the call, he remembered that we just came out of the show, immediately whisked us to a window table and our drinks (Eiffel Affair cocktails) materialized within minutes!  The rest of the evening went very smoothly.  We took his recommendations and the dishes were spectacular.  We had the king crab appetizers.  My dinner companion had a rack of lamb, and I had the beef Wellington. For dessert, we had the Pistachio and Grand Marnier souffle.  Each dish was a celebration.  They're delish!!!! And the view was spectacular.  If you are in Vegas, and you don't think that you'd take the journey to the actual Eiffel Tower anytime soon, I'd think that this is a second prize experience.  Enjoyable food+friendly, knowledgeable and speedy service+terrific views=Unforgettable experience.  There was a proposal happening next to us and it ended with a \"Yes\".  The restaurant manager came out to congratulate the happy couple, and check on the other patrons.  We heard him said that they have not experienced a \"No\" throughout the history of the restaurant.  So if you are planning, give them a chance to help out.",

I'm like it's waters buddy.... anyways sat down took 10 min to get our menu. Then decided to eat and request lots of bread bc no one ever came around to take our order. Food wasn't anything special.

The whole evening everyone we interacted with made a point of telling mentioning and congratulating us on our anniversary.  It was a small thing, but it made a big difference.  I requested a table near the window and we sat over the strip facing the Bellagio fountain, which was a great view.  The food was very good and we left very content and full.  Our glasses were never left empty (which is a pet peeve of mine) and the service was consistent but not bothering.  I would highly recommend this for guys to keep in your back pocket as a dinner location for special events or for making up some good karma.",

    "text": "Waiters and hosts are not friendly or patient WHATSOEVER. Read my story.  Walking in: you see a magnificent kitchen with focused culinary artists paying attention to every detail of the food.  Then, you wait for the host to tell you there's no window seats available though the restaurant just opened. You are puzzled and confused. You wait 30 minutes for the table and the host skips you because you're dad is the only one of your party there but you left for the bathroom. (A rule I've never heard before) You're forced to awkwardly ask for a window seat again. Finally, while making friendly chit chat with the  hostess, you get what you want..  You take selfies for da memoriez but you have waiters and waitresses giving you major stink eye.  Soon, the server comes to offer a great arrangement of breads with butter and a palette cleanser.  Your waiter comes up to you right after and expects you to have a decision. You don't and you are rushed to order. The waiter is very annoyed and walks away. So you feel unwelcomed....  The waiter comes a second time. We all order something different. He leaves. As he comes back around, you want to change your order to salmon instead of chicken. He tells you, \"No, I already ordered chicken in the kitchen.\" You say oh okay never mind :). And the waiter dashes off in a hasty fashion. You don't get it, that something easily changable. Honestly, you would go to the kitchen and change it yourself if you could.  You receive your food with stunning presentation, it was quite the instagram meal to go with the view. You were enjoying every bite but your dad didn't like his chicken. He told our, so far, degenerate waiter that he wasn't expecting shards of bones and grissle in the chicken. Waiter said, \"Well it's not supposed to be boneless\" your dad says,\"I know but I wasn't expecting shards of bone and grissle I was expecting a breast\" and the waiter says,\"Oh okay.\" And dashes off once again. I thought he would at least apologize. The restaurant is VERY dimly lit so reading the menu for someone with bad eye sight is HARD. Especially when half is in french and some ingredients are things you've never even heard of. We watch him suffer through his meal.  From that rude encounter, you knew this waiter already did not like your family because they didn't order quick enough and he really just wants us to go away. You don't think they've had any strange requests or rude remarks. They're just a bunch of awkward, quiet folk over here.  This waiter decides to have happy chit chats with all the other customers around you and runs past your table every single time, which is kind of distracting. Not like you wanted to ask anything more from him anyway.   It's a great place to take pictures with family. They would get up by the window on occasion to take pictures with the Bellagio fountain. Meanwhile, that waiter would sit in the dark corner and GLARES at you having a good time. AND HE WOULD TALK ABOUT YOU WITH OTHER WAITERS. It's getting really ridiculous now. Clearly he doesn't want a tip. AND your family stayed there shorter than both tables beside them and your family were quiet people. NO DISTURBANCE. They definitely rubbed this waiter the wrong way but not for him to turn all middle schooler on us, damn!  You decide to be nice to him. When he collected our plates and uneasily offered dessert. You smiled at him and acted very pleased. And he actually asked where were you guys from and you said the Bay Area. And he said Aw California. And he dropped the menus and walked away.... Okay.  The waiter comes by right when we finished and collects the plates and drops the bill on the table. As so expected, very unwelcoming.  Basically, y'all paid for the spot. and like many others your party stayed there for a little while longer. Soak in the breathtaking sight: the fountains, the lights, the dimmly lit room!  Began to leave and the waiter is glaring at you again, pointing you out to his waiter buddies. It takes a while to put on my coat and scarf and he intends to just keep staring at my family and I. I hope this time he was staring at us because he noticed no tip on the table...  The management clearly cannot stand the type that aren't fancy and high class. My waiter deeply disliked us for no real reason other than maybe we embodied some aspects of bad customers before. But I believe he deserved the no tip left on the badly cleaned table. Leaving on a positive note, the restaurant has an excellent taste for any savory or sweet dishes. All foods are creamy and I absolutely love that! The view is everything! But I wish the waiters and hosts put more care into their craft like that cooks.",

    "text": "I once read, \" Don't be so quick to judge, you never know when you might just find yourself walking in that person's shoes.\" Well, in my experience of dining at Eiffel Tower Restaurant, that quote might just very well ends with \"you never know when you might just find yourself sitting at their best table, and enjoy it, too!!\"  While planning our Anniversary/Christmas Trip to Vegas, BF asked that I must plan a meal here because he had such a phenomenal experience in the past. I begrudgingly agreed because I thought there are so many new and exciting restaurants on the strip that we can try. So, me, being the shortsighted idiot, made a reservation for lunch instead of dinner.   After we checked in with the host and hopped onto the exclusive elevator that somehow managed to transport us from the tackiness around Paris Hotel to a realm of sheer elegance. Sure enough, knowing it was an anniversary celebration trip for us, the thoughtful folks from Eiffel Tower Restaurant seated us at their famous corner table (yes, Table 56!!) With the breathtaking view, the etiquettes from our attentive maitre d', server, and busboy, I suddenly realized that my BF's stubbornness wasn't that much of a burden after all.   Our server and bus boy promptly presented and served us the menu and freshly made baguette. Our server thoroughly explained every item on the menu to us, and we opted for:  - Creamy French Onion Soup (unlike any other French onion soup, this wasn't as cheesy nor greasy but rather light. Please don't get me wrong; the flavors and the creaminess weren't compromised in any way.) - Cold Foie Gras Torchon (rich and dense foie gras wrapped with duck prosciutto, along with fig, and then smeared on top of the brioche. I particularly enjoyed how the foie gras was presented in a similar texture as butter and the way it melts upon ingestion.) - Lamb Burger (As a big fan of lamb, I naturally ordered it medium rare. The spices immersed the lamb heavenly, served with chips, and a side of harissa aioli.)  - Aged Parmesan Crusted Chicken (crispy and juicy, it reminded me of the chicken schnitzel that I had from \"Johannes\" at Palms Springs.)  Plus...  - Apple strudel (I usually don't like to mix fruit with dessert, so it's my BF who ordered this. However, I fairly enjoyed my few bites of pate feuilletee dipped in the caramel sauce.)  Other than the strudel, they also sent us a complimentary chocolate souffle for our anniversary, which was a very lovely gesture. Now that I'm thinking back, my biggest regret during my entire trip was that not only I didn't get to taste their evening tasting menu, but I also didn't get a chance to try their famous Grand Marnier Souffle (since it's only served during dinner.) Mind you, prior to my lunch at Eiffel Tower, BF and I had just our previous dinner at \"Le Cirque,\" and quite frankly that dinner was not even close to this lunch at Eiffel Tower Restaurant. I applaud the classiness of their attentive and gracious staffs. My highest compliments to the chefs and the entire Eiffel Tower Restaurant Team, for this exceptionally exquisite meal and making us feel special the entire time. I cannot wait to go back!!",

It's a gorgeous view of the Strip. This was a great combination of good food with a great view, p.s. and great company. What else can I ask for? Lol I made a last minute reservation for Saturday brunch the day before and requested a seat by a window, and though not guaranteed, we did get our table right next to the window. Keep in mind this is right across from the Bellagio fountains so you get to enjoy that as well!   For our meal I had the New York Strip Steak, was delicious! I want to say my boo had the French Bucatini pasta, but I'm not sure that's the name, lol it was also great, I'm not the biggest fan of mushrooms, regardless I loved it!!    If you're debating whether or not to try this restaurant, don't think about it too much the answer is YES make a reservation! Definitely worth trying!!",

FOOD: I am not a huge fan of French Cuisine but this was good.  Great quality food and easy for anyone to eat if they aren't familiar with French food.    SERVICE:  FANTASTIC. Our server was very respectful and the server assistant was very attentive and respectful to give us our space when we wanted it.  I think she read my lips one time when I said I needed more coffee because before I could turn my head to get someone's attention she came with the coffee and said  \"I'm here!\" I was so impressed!  From the host stand, to the servers, and back to the host stand, I had the best customer service in Vegas at The Eiffel Tower Restaurant.  AMBIANCE: It was the perfect balance of comfort and class.  I loved the windows and the decor.   VIEW: INCREDIBLE. I was able to get a panoramic view of the Bellagio water show but also an unobstructed view of the strip.  With the decor and the views that it offers, it is a new MUST-DO destination on EVERY Vegas trip in the future.    I will be coming to the Eiffel Tower Restaurant every time I visit now and am now open to staying at the hotel.  I haven't had dinner there but I definitely will next time!  I'm a raving fan!",

Super romantic and perfect for the occasion.   The food was pretty good, had the pork belly appetizer and we both got the veal medallions. It was tasty but I was still kinda hungry after....  its fine dining so I expected high prices for small portions. The staff (hostesses, bartender, server, busser) were all wonderful.   Overall this is a very good place to impress your date or for a special occasion but if you just want some really good french food on the strip I would say to go try Bouchon in Venetian.",

You can never go wrong with the surf and turf. You get to enjoy the best of both worlds by eating steak and lobster in one meal.  The seafood platter is our usual choice for an appetizer. I like it because there's no smell of seafood and their variety of sauces are perfect.  MUST try the souffle. I tried their chocolate, caramel, and strawberry flavors.

Arriving early for our reservation, we were seated at the bar, even though there were plenty of open tables. I don't have an issue with that, except that we had to pay for our drinks separately from the rest of the meal.  The cocktail I had was amazing - something to do with strawberries and maple syrup and black pepper. It was perfectly balanced, taste wise, and super-strong.   The blue cheese souffle starter was wonderful. Firmer than I usually expect from a souffle (I was disappointed that it didn't collapse) it came with a tasty salad and fantastic balsamic dressing. I could have licked the plate.  Unfortunately the steak with Bearnaise sauce was a little dry and chewy - not what I expect for $56 - and so large that I was unable to finish it. Hubby had the venison chops, which he finished with relish.   Thanks to the huge portions, I  skipped dessert altogether.  The view is spectacular, but at $350 for a meal for 2, it's definitely best saved for a very special occasion.",

Atmosphere is nice and service is very good.   Views of the strip and the Bellagio fountains are also very nice.  This restaurant is on the pricey side, even for Las Vegas, so be prepared to spend.  Now, the food.   The menu is a meat lover's delight with only one veg option available, and steaks start at about $75 and $56 for a filet.   I ordered the filet in the red wine reduction and have to say it was very good, albeit a little over-done.  The salad as my start was great and fresh, as was the bread and even the butter.  They usually comp a small chef's sampling and our group was treated to a smaller shot of a cauliflower foam - also outstanding.   The wine list is expansive and expensive, mark ups seem higher than most other LV premium restaurants.   I liked the food and would go 5* here if the prices were more down to earth.",

You get there by the elevator in the casino, and walk past the kitchen to the restaurant. The food is soooo good! I ordered the baked crepes and my boyfriend had the lamb burger. Both were delicious! They served us some mushroom flan as well, which was surprisingly good, and I don't even like mushrooms.  The restaurant is pricey, but it is really nice! The service was friendly and took our picture for us. There weren't many people there for lunch when we got there, so we didn't have to make reservations or wait at all,  but we got there right about when they opened for lunch. I'm sure it's a lot more crowded during dinner. If you are looking for a more upscale restaurant or maybe a place for a date, or to get dressed up, this place is awesome.",

    "text": "I had my birthday dinner here last Sunday, May 25, 2014 with my partner.  We consider ourselves \"foodies\" and we had an exceptional dining experience at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant.    The meal itself was outstanding and my highest complements to the chef.  We started with escargot and a kale salad that literally made our taste buds jump out of our mouths.  I had the Beef Wellington.  At the first bite, I swear I saw the sky open up and trumpets sound.  Absolutely the best meal I have ever had.  The puff pastry surrounding the filet was delicate and the mignon was well seasoned and perfectly cooked.  My partner had rabbit and it too was truly a gastronomic gift from God.    Our server was terrific and suggested the pistachio souffle to end our dining experience and I am so glad she did.  It was delicious.     We sat by the window, just one table from the corner and had an excellent view of the strip and the Bellagio light/water show.  The meal, paired with some excellent wine, was one that I will not forget.   I can't wait to go back.  My only constructive criticism would be to tell the staff, except the initial server, to stop coming to the table so often.  I love to enjoy good food AND good conversation and I like to take my time with a good meal.  We were disrupted, too many times for my taste, by wait staff asking if they could clear our plates.  I don't enjoy it when plates are taken from the table before everyone is finished.  Just my own pet peeve and it did not mar the evenings culinary experience.  WHAT A MEAL!!",

My girlfriend made reservations in advance, made sure I got the best seat in the house complimented by red roses which she bought from the restaurant (very nice touch). We were seated at a half-moon table overlooking the Bellagio fountains. The service was top notch. I enjoyed my salmon a lot. My girlfriend liked her steak although it wasn't her absolute favorite. The green beans were average. What blew me away was the desert. Because it was my birthday they brought me complimentary mouse, which was delicious. We had also ordered a white chocolate banana elysee, which came out to be a work of culinary art. Amazing thin circles of white chocolate layered with fresh bananas and a torched sugar arc. Just amazing. Highly recommend this experience and can not wait to go back.",

I stopped by here with my fiance and some of her co-workers on my most recent trip to Vegas. We didn't have reservations whenever we made our way over here but that didn't prove to be a problem as we were seated within a reasonable amount of time. The table that we sat at ended up having a good view of the casino although I would have much preferred the strip. I ended up ordering the roasted farm raised chicken which was moist, juicy and good. It came with a side of green beans that had a lemon butter sauce on it which was amazing.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future. The food was good and I was surprised that the prices were a lot more reasonable than I had expected.",

We rushed up there and had a great view of the fountains.  The waiter was from France which was cool and the staff were very attentive.  Our food was delicious we ordered scallop appetizer (2 scallops and leeks) Beef wellinton Lobster Florentine They gave us a little chocolate pudding dessert which was very good.

It was not busy when we went at 1pm but the Bellagio fountain doesn't start either around that time in the weekday. So if you come for the evening, prepare to be mesmerized by the view!  It was $30 with three course.   First course was an Alaskan King Crab, beautifully presented.  Second course was a Flat Iron Steak that was cooked perfectly.  Last course was Pistachio and Chocolate Creme Brulee.   I'm glad I got to try this restaurant finally! Probably won't be back for the food but I actually would come back for the cocktails!",

First of all, I expected this to be a cheesy Vegas tourist trap, which I was totally into doing on Thanksgiving day -- but when I arrived for lunch, the hostess informed me that they weren't opening until 2 p.m. dinner service. She recommended another spot for me to eat in the hotel but I told her, \"Well, I wasn't really there for the food, more for the experience.\" So, she offered to bring me upstairs to have a look.  How gorgeous is this place! Incredible view of the strip and the Bellagio fountains. Beautifully designed and elegant -- really feels like you're \"inside\" the Eiffel Tower. The hostess took the time to show me the Thanksgiving menu and even checked to make sure they'd be serving their famous souffles later. I promised to come back at least for a drink.  When I had a less-than-stellar Thanksgiving dinner elsewhere, I found myself returning to the Eiffel Tower and took a seat at the bar. The seasonal special souffle, pumpkin, was TO DIE FOR. The souffles take 45 minutes because they're freshly prepared, so if you know you want one, best to get that order in ASAP.  While I waited for it, I sipped on a 13-year rye recommended by my bartender (who let me have a little sip to be sure I'd like it) and took in the atmosphere. I was dining solo but at least two bartenders made sure I was taken care of and happy, and I never felt alone.",

For our entrees we had the trout and rack of lamb. The lamb was the clear winner.  We asked for medium but it come out medium rare.  I'm not complaining as I think next time we'll just order it medium rare.   Both the creme brulee and passion fruit merengue desserts looked like stunning pieces of art.  That being said I probably wouldn't order either again. Both were solid but for the price tag they tasted only ok.",

They even offered a shall to help keep warm.   My friend and I both started with a salad. I had the market greens. The presentation was perfect and I ate every last bit of it off my plate. Next was the queen filet. I ordered it medium well, which I know most places hate. It definitely wasn't medium well, just normal medium, but it was still good. Although I would have expected a nicer place like this to be able to handle it. I also had the mashed potatoes which were very good. Wish I had tried the asparagus to branch out though.   We finished with the lemon and blueberry souffle. I was honestly unimpressed. Maybe I would have liked it more if we'd gotten chocolate or Nutella.   All in all a great experience even if it was slightly pricey.",

She was very friendly and funny, and made it a very enjoyable experience. I wish I had caught her name but did not. The view was good, my only complaint is the bars on the windows. I enjoyed the high roller more so and the view on the high roller more but we were at a different vantage point in Paris. Everything's pricey in Vegas, and this is no exception. Will likely skip this next time but enjoyed the experience!",

    "text": "I had the extreme pleasure of being taken here for my birthday dinner by my beautiful girlfriend. Wow, what a treat. I rarely give out 5 star reviews but this place totally deserves it. There really wasn't anything that wasn't perfect, from the service to the food. Top notch all around.   We made a request to be seated at the windows overlooking the strip and the Bellagio fountains and our request was granted. Such an awesome view. The restaurant itself is gorgeous too. Low lit, classy, and very tastefully decorated. It feels like you're in an old school, classic, French saloon or something.   Our server Michael (and it's weird calling him that because it felt more like he was a friend who had been here many times and knew what was good) was great. He knew literally everything about the menu and had perfect recommendations. He was prompt, friendly, and accommodating, especially for someone like me who was trying escargot and octopus for the first time!  Speaking of that, the escargot was great and the seared octopus was even better. I was surprised how mild the flavor of the escargot was. It comes served with something similar to a hush puppy filled with a creamy pea sauce. The octopus was meaty and well seasoned. It sort of had a lobster'esque quality to it, but not 'seafoody' tasting at all. I'd definitely order it again.   For my entree I had the TWELVE (massive) ounce filet with some creamy mashed potatoes and asparagus on the side. The filet had a beautiful crust on it and was a perfect warm pink in the center. One of the best filets I've ever had. I had trouble finishing it with how massive it was. And I loved the mashed potatoes and asparagus. I've never seen asparagus served with small egg bits, what a nice touch!  For dessert we split the chocolate souffle. Again, it was great. Substantial bready center filled with rich, bitter chocolatey goodness. You can't go wrong.   Can't wait to come back next time we're in Vegas.   Here's my overall ratings: Atmosphere- 4.5/5 Quality/value- 4.5/5 Service- 5/5 Food- 5/5 Drinks- 4/5",

If you are dining as a couple, the tables with prime viewings overlooking the Bellagio fountains is set up so both of you can look out towards The Strip. -romantic ambiance. But still a great place for bachelorette parties or just a nice girls night out. -You get to the restaurant through elevator access and that would be located in the middle of the casino floor. We valet our cars and it was a pretty short walk. Just a bit longer if you self-park in the garage.  I really enjoyed the food. Started off with the Market Greens salad with avocado, sunflower seeds in a walnut vinaigrette. For my entree I ordered the Alaskan Wild Cod, comes with quinoa pilaf, zucchini in a beurre blanc sauce. Hands down, I would order both items again. Delicious! Typical high end restaurant Strip prices. My salad was $18.00 and my entree was $46.00.  Reservations are highly recommended. Doesn't matter what day, time, or occasion.",

    "text": "Okay okay so I had no idea there was a restaurant up here at all! We were just walking around and I noticed there was an elevator and I was like it wouldn't hurt to check it out. Then as we went up, the view got better and better. It was overlooking the Fountains at Bellagio!   During this time, we had already ate but we made sure to make a reservation the next day to check it out! First things first, this is a very expensive restaurant so make sure you're ready. I got the Rossini Style Filet Mignon, Fois Gras, Truffle Sauce which at the time was $79. I also got Assorted Seasonal Wild Mushrooms which was $15. I don't know if Truffle and Truffle sauce is the same thing but it was my first time trying out Truffle. I'm pretty sure that the Filet Mignon that I got was the best that I've ever had. No joke, it melted in my mouth and in general that's the best steak type meal that I've had. However, the dessert took it to another level. I've been wanting to try out Souffle and understand whats the hype is all about. I ordered the Nutella and Pistachio Souffle which were both $16. WOW is the reaction that I had when I tried it. I believe it is my favorite dessert of all time. Once you take a bite and add in either the Nutella or Pistachio its like a game changer. I love the fluffiness and consistency of it.   I wholeheartedly recommend this place if you feeling fancy for the night! Even though my Filet Mignon was really really good, I recommend the dessert the most because I guess I'm such a sweet tooth kind of guy. Please come by if you are in the area!",

They had a vegetarian tasting menu but at 125 dollars I didn't want to take the risk. I switched my reservation to lunch and I'm happy I did. The food as much as it hurts to say wa a really BLAND. There was no flavor or texture it was just BLAH. Desert was not bad but there's so many better restaurants in VEGAS. It surprised me because I love the restaurant down stairs but this place did not hit the spot. With a lunch reservation at 2:30 it seemed like wait staff was rushing us out to make room for the dinner reservation FOOD AND CHECK CAME SO FAST, while we were eating entrees they asked us what we want for desert. Our view of the fountains weren't even that great honestly not worth the money we spent. Only one table all the way the corner has a nice view...  DO NOT GO JUST FOR THE VIEW TAKE YOU MONEY ELSEWHERE TRUST ME! Yes the elevator ride up there is cool and it's a nice experience but that's as far as it gets.",

For starters i got the Caesar Salad, it was larger then i expected with dressing on the side,, if you love anchovies (which i do) I highly recommend. You can dig down into the dressing for the full anchovy experience or skim the oil and vinegar off the top.  My friends cream of celery soup was divine.  Mains were Ribeye and the Filet with Foie Gras.  sides were Asparagus and au gratin potatoes.  dessert ,, well ,, there were 3 !! we ordered the souffle (chocolate of course) and then they brought us little \"chocolate\" bites ,, then came the complimentary birthday mousse.  Cocktails wine and cognac rounded out the beverage order.    2 complaints   1.  for a 400$ dinner you'd think they could supply something sharper then a butter knife for the steaks ,, my goodness Black Angus has better cuttlery ,, i basically had to stab my steak with my fork in a fist to try and cut the thing (and it was very tender)   2.  the air was to cold (it was not a warm day) which made it impossible to  linger over my food like  i would have liked ,, my foie gras was cold at the end ,,that made me sad",

My wife and I decided to try this restaurant because the hotel concierge recommended it and we were sure glad he did.  We had seats that were overlooking the Bellagio fountains and that was our view for dinner. The service was on point and the food was excellent.   The only downside to this restaurant is that there were a lot of wedding parties going on during our dinner. I would say that during our meal there were about 4 or 5 wedding parties come in for their dinner reception. And by the food and the service we received it is easy to understand why they would have their reception here. It did make it feel like we were crashing someone's wedding. But that was the only negative and while it might be a little weird it definitely wasn't enough to give this place a four star.",

I would come back and just hang out at the bar and just eat souffle if I could.  I also like their communication too. They would text me updates and offer me window seating at an earlier time. And with the window seating, it's a big plus when you dine here.  I recommend signing up for \"Lettuce Eats.\" You get points and earn $10 for every $140 you spend. There are a lot of restaurants under Lettuce Eats so you can earn points by not just eating at the Eiffel Tower.  Note to David G (<a href=\"mailto:dgazzano@leye.com\">dgazzano@leye.com</a>). Hey, if you're going tell people to email you directly for upcoming service, the least you can do is actually email people back. I pretty much did everything via Open Table without your help. Thanks bud!",

Lunch is reasonable, you can walk in and enjoy $16 sandwiches, salads, and even baked crepes with custom cocktails and a full bar...and you can eat at the bar and enjoy the wonderful views of the strip.   Dinner is 5 star fine dining with steaks, chops, and reservations required. I took my parents here and we enjoyed just about everything...and the tab was reflective!  Make no doubt, dinner is special here.   The service has always been 5 star, outstanding. At dinner, our waiter practically stood in the corner waiting to see if we needed anything (In his immaculate tuxedo).  Come for lunch...or get a dinner reservation. Either way, you will leave happy and impressed.",

The view is beautiful, providing an outlook over the fountains across the street. The ambience is very intimate and romantic and the elevator ride up to the restaurant is fun as well. I would say that reservations should be considered to get the best table possible.  Food: The food was also up to par with my high expectations. Going to a restaurant of such class it is expected that food should correspond in level of quality. We got the escargot as an appetizer, and for the main course the lamb and a steak. The escargot was good; however, I would not say that it's the best I have ever had, in fact I prefer the escargot at Mon Ami Gabi downstairs. The steak however was delicious, and the mashed potatoes we got on the side went perfectly. The lamb was also amazing, being succulent and perfectly cooked. The meal was also surprisingly filling. The wine list was also extensive and there was complimentary bread offered to us multiple times throughout our meal which was nice.  Service: Our waiter was rather attentive and was frequently checking up on us to ensure that we were never needing something. Additionally, the woman who served our wine was exceptional, never letting our glasses stay empty while moving very swiftly and efficiently.   Overall I would say this is a restaurant made for special events like birthdays, anniversaries, etc. as the romantic atmosphere is no joke. The food met my expectations however I would be hesitant to say they exceeded them. Regardless I enjoyed my dinner and would recommend to anyone looking to have a special night out.",

Came here recently for a celebratory dinner with my loved ones and once you step out of the elevator (that took you up to the restaurant) the magic begins. The restaurant's romantic vibe really shines at night and the fancy lounge interior just made the setting so perfect for special occasions. Besides the food actually tasting pretty good: its the experience that really tops it all. Picture this: you get to see a panoramic, bird's-eye view of Las Vegas strip and the Bellagio fountain show. So gorgeous!   For the food, I ordered:   * Maine Lobster: it consists of warm Maine lobster meat, savoy cabbage, black trumpet mushrooms and sauce Americaine; and boy did I have just the perfect appetizer! I love everything on the plate and everything was cooked with such perfection. The lobster was so fresh and together with the sauce, it tasted brilliant.   * Prime Aged New York Steak: This comes highly recommended by our waiter and it was nothing less than scrumptious. The meat was ultra tender, perfectly pink to my medium rare request and seasoning was just flawless. May I suggest, that you order this with their accompanying Bearnaise sauce for that extra touch of yum! I was really fond of the side dishes as well, the wild mushroom was especially great, it has that smoky flavor and chewy texture... I simply couldn't get enough!  * Pistachio Souffle: Hands down the best Souffle I've ever had! Soft and airy with a subtle taste of pistachio - the sweetest closure to our wonderful dinner.   All in all, Eiffel Tower Restaurant absolutely had won me over for the best combination of stunning food, excellent service and breathtaking ambiance - It was a wonderful first experience and a dinner worthy of remembrance.",

The overall restaurant is angled so that it provides a 270 degree view of the strip and surrounding area... very impressive and there's really not a bad seat in the house.   We arrived and had a drink at the bar... the bartender was very friendly and set us back about $30 for drink and tip... but on the strip that's to be expected. Nice place to kill some time (and money) while you wait for a table... window side views must be requested at time of checkin, so id recommend getting here early if thats what youre looking for.   The food: i ordered the roasted rack of lamb - done just right (at medium rare) and plated very elegantly (as one hopes/expects in a French restaurant  of this caliber). The tomato tart was not especially memorable and felt more like a garnish than a side.   The service was fine. Since the tables are close, I could tell our server basically had a script of things he said to each table which made him feel a little impersonal, but he was friendly and attentive. Maybe since this is a French place impersonal is what they are going for for authenticity?  For the desert we ordered a chocolate souffle, as our waiter said these were \"famous\" at this restaurant. Maybe I'm not a souffle type guy, as to me it just kind of tasted of hot chocolate in a solid form - which i suppose is not a bad thing if you love hot chocolate.  All in all, a great place and not 'hokey' at all despite it's location which was my worry. It's legit fine dining restaurant for sure, but for my money doesn't rank in the strip's top tier.",

    "text": "My sister and I had dinner here last night (on her company's dime, thank god) and were hugely disappointed.  We sat near the window...with barely a view of the strip.   It's really not that high up, so I wasn't incredibly impressed by the view people keep yapping about.  If you want an amazing view, I suggest the Top of the World restaurant at the Stratosphere instead.  For ambiance, I'd give it 4 stars.  It was nice although sound from other tables really carries well.    Let's talk about the food since that's the most important part about the experience.  Ok, for a place this expensive, I don't expect good.  I expect damn good.  And damn, it wasn't good.  For bread, it was typical crusty baguette, multigrain, or sourdough.  Nothing to write home about.  To start off, the menu had enough choices, but we didn't see anything that really stuck out.  Yes it's a fancy French restaurant, so I expected to not know what half the words meant, but come on, you don't have to make the menu sound so pretentious!  Anyway, as an appetizer ($20), the escargot was quite nice, better than Mon Ami Gabi downstairs and was much better than either of our entrees: Wild Red Snapper & Duck 2 Ways.  My fish was light and delicate, cooked in grapeseed oil.  It was served over really buttery swiss chard, onions, and broccolini.  For $40, I expected my taste buds to be dancing and begging for more.  They weren't.  My sister's $40 duck was (as the named implied) cooked 2 ways...confit (fancy way of saying fried) and roasted to a medium rare.  The confit lacked favor and moisture.  It was definitely over cooked.  I prefer the duck hanging in the windows of Chinatown hole in the walls over this any day.  The roasted duck was better...although a little too rare for my taste.  It was served over a mix of wild rice, braised turnip and other fancy stuff I can't pronounce.  It tasted fine but again I wasn't jumping up and down.  We also ordered  a side of the sauteed wild mushrooms, which were yummy.  But not worth 9 bucks.  We skipped dessert because nothing sounded that appealing.    Service was your typical upscale restaurant service...nice, prompt, but unmemorable.  If I had actually paid for the meal, I would feel totally ripped off.  I've had my fair share of nice fancy restaurants with spectacular views, but this place is needs to work on making it's food more approachable and frankly, good. Overall, I think the place itself is nice...especially for a special outing, but for the food and the price you'd pay for it, go elsewhere.",

    "text": "Came here for my birthday this year and was definitely impressed! Loved taking the elevator up and being greeted by the hostess and shown the kitchen as we entered the dining room. We'd arrived early to have a drink at the bar and after some miscommunication, the bartender finally discovered they did serve Pastis, and luckily he did knew how to prepare it correctly.  I'd made the reservation a month in advance and requested a window table and was thrilled when we were led to a small table totally overlooking the Bellagio fountain. The sommelier introduced himself and helped us pick out a reasonably priced Cote du Rhone. The prices are pretty steep here, but the wine list is a little out of control!   We started with a salad and a delicious salmon dish. I'm glad we began with small plates, as my lamb main course was just spectacular, although an enormous portion. The pricing on the meat dishes seemed somewhat alright when I ordered, until I realized that sides need to be ordered separately. My potato au gratin was well worth the extra cash though.  For dessert, I had the chocolate souffle which they decorated with a \"happy birthday\" in chocolate sauce on the plate. The dinner was leisurely and absolutely wonderful. Was glad I didn't have to pick up the tab, but if someone else is paying it's worth the trip!",

In a nut shell, my girlfriend and I waited an hour for a table we requested to be by a window for the view just to have dessert. We didn't mind the wait but when we finally did get seated an hour later, we were asked by the server to move to the lounge area because they can \"ACCOMMODATE\" us there. We even told the hostess that we were just having the dessert and she said it was OK. The server just wanted his tip rather than to do his job and serve. I wish i could rate this Restaurant a big fat ZERO because over all they suck! Yes! i might not have been there to have a full meal, but we deserve to be treated equally. NOT RECOMMENDED.",

They were so kind and so nice about it I was floored. Also need to mention we had gone there the night before to see where they were and the man downstairs at the elevator was so nice that he insisted he take us up for a look at the view so we could see the view that we had asked about it.Kudos to Keith(I hope I remember his name correctly.)The food was lovely and fresh and the view spectacular. The lady greeter on the day said it was a good thing we were late because now we could stretch out our lunch and sit a while if we wanted and see the water show at the Bellagio across the street. We stayed and took her advise and it was so worth it. The place was technically closed but they still refolded my napkin when I got up and they took our pictures for us. All this and we were 30 min late for our opentable reservation. We had front row seats to the water show at the Bellagio without standing outside in the cold. The kitchen is amazing to look at. It is right outside the elevator.",

We came not sure what to expect but what we got surpassed any possible expectations we couldve had. First and foremost the food was amazing. I had the Quail and she had the skirt steak. Both were delicious and rich in flavor. The portions weren't the biggest but it was so rich we were full anyway.   In terms of service the waiter we had was great. He was friendly and helpful and always checked up on us. He was very professional and did not reveal the surprise dessert for my girlfriend (he even neglected to tell me and i almost forgot). We also were seated right in front of the bellagio water show.  For dessert we were given a free chocolate mousse and we ordered the banana white chocolate tower thingie (i forget what its called). So because i put in the comment section of the online reservation that it was my girlfriend's birthday, they brought her a small chocolate mousse and surrounding the tiny shot glass of chocolate was Happy Birthday drizzled in chocolate. She was totally unaware this was going to happen and she had a huge smile on her face when it came. After that we decided to be bold and ordered the white chocolate banana dessert which was delicious. The presentation was awesome as well. The white chocolate is flattened and then bananas are thinly sliced and stacked in layers of chocolate then bananas. Of course its all drizzled in melted white chocolate and the top is covered with a caramelized sugar dome that was cool to look at and eat.",

I ordered char-broiled steak with red wine sauce, which I liked, and my hubby ordered the Wellington beef (like pastry/pot pie filled with soft, tender beef), which I thought tasted even better than my dish.  They served a complimentary hors d'oeuvre before our meal (a cheesy bread and flan with duck meat) and bread.  The bread would have tasted better if it was warmer, but oh well. After our meal, the waiter even brought me a chocolate mousse dessert for my birthday!

    "text": "We ended up having dinner here because we had originally reserved at Lutece and they cancelled our reservation at the very last minute without warning because they decided to do a private party in there.  (Don't book at Lutece, kids, unless you either know the owner personally or you want to take a chance on your reservation that was made two weeks previously  getting suddenly cancelled a few hours before dinner.)  I was a little nervous to eat at the Eiffel Tower because the idea of a restaurant on top of a fake Eiffel in Vegas seemed awfully touristy-Disneyland rather than the nice, elegant dinner we wanted to have, but we didn't have a lot of options given how late Lutece pulled the rug out from under us.    We were pleasantly surprised by how nice the dinner and the service were at the Eiffel Tower.  Our table had a nice view of the Bellagio fountain.  We had the tasting menu, which was good, and a lot of good (not spectacular, but definitely well above average) food.  The overall dining experience was very pleasant.  My only complaints were (1) it took a really long time for them to bring the next course from time to time, which was a little weird as the restaurant was not that full at the hour we went, so this isn't a place to eat if you're in a hurry; and (2)  if you got the tasting menu it had to be for two people, and one of us might have wanted something different, but went along with the other one of us who wanted tasting menu.  I don't see what the big deal is in preparing it for one person, as much of it seemed to be little bits of premade food that was just cooked and dressed up with sauce, but whatever.  As this is a fancy place we were a little taken aback to see a family come in and sit next to us who weren't exactly dressed up to the nines and acted like they just got off the train from Podunk (talking loud, asking stupid questions about the menu, etc.) but it is Las Vegas, there are going to be tourists.  However, the tables aren't jammed together in this restaurant, so it  wasn't like the Clampetts came and sat in our lap, and we were able to largely ignore them.    The restrooms are very nice and have nice, well-mannered attendants.    Overall,  a nice and not too \"touristy\" dining experience.",

    "text": "My party was extremely disappointed and upset about our experience at dinner.   We made reservations days before at 7:30, noted that it was my fathers birthday & arrived on time. Before we ordered we told the server in advance that we had a 9pm show. The server said that was fine and it wouldn't take that long. We put our orders in and talked amongst ourselves and snapped pictures while we waited. After waiting 1 hour and 20 mins my party and I were getting nervous about being late for our show. During this wait time we did not even get checked up on!   My boyfriend finally got up and tried to cancel our order with the host, but she told him that she couldn't do that and we had to wait while she paged our waiter. So we waited another 10 mins. Our waiter never showed and a manager came over to charge us and say the beef Wellington took a long time to cook (waiter told us he had it in the oven with 5 others and was coming our fast) tsk tsk. By that point we didn't even want to argue and just wanted to catch our show. Everyone in our party then left and said they would meet us down by the casino.  Then a waiters comes with 1 out of the five entrees I'm guessing in hopes to keep us, but I told him we already canceled our order and he didn't care and went away. Seriously can't you see we have an empty table (bf and I stayed back to pay for drinks) and that we are not at all happy, and again how is one entree out of five suppose to be ok??  While leaving we noticed a few other couples tables canceling their orders and leaving also. We thought this was so weird because they had a lot of tables empty... But whatever. We were looking forward to this dinner for weeks and it is so disappointing that it ended this way especially since we went out of the way and told them that we had a show and asked if the dishes we ordered were ok with our time frame.   So sad I won't ever be returning, but this horrible service was the worst!",

I made the reservation far in advance and was excited to dine with such a great view of the strip.  Apparently, none of that mattered to them, as I was told my reservation was cancelled due to the restaurant being bought out that night. When was I told of this? Only one day in advance! The hostess that spoke to me didn't even apologize or offer any consolations.  Horrible service. Definitely not going to be trying to eat at this place.",

A nice bottle of champagne...and at the suggestion of our waiter the chocolate souffle...he suggested it half way though our main course as it took extra time to prepare.

We probably saw the show like 5-10 times during our dinner.     He order the fillet mignon with potato croquettes and I got their black cod. He loved his fillet mignon and I really like the black cod too, but towards the end, it got a bit too salty for me. The potato croquette were so good; very crispy and tasty.

The bride had the NY steak and I had the fish that Chef makes in the video online. Best dinner ever. At any restaurant at any time ever. Kudos for Mario for keeping the table next to us in check.

    "text": "My first Yelp review, and long overdue!  Me and my now fiance had a spectacular dinner here on 8/20/2013 to celebrate our engagement.  I arranged a special dinner & evening out with the Restaurant Supervisor Lyle Tolhurst and Restaurant Director of Special Events Annie Kang-Drachen.  They came thru for us big-time!  I didn't actually utilize their \"proposal package\" per se, as I had already popped the question a little over an hour beforehand during a rather elaborate day of events... but Annie did arrange for several elements of their proposal package to be included with our dinner \"package\".  [customized menus printed, flowers for the table, pictures, tour to top of the tower and the 2 hour limo tour after dinner]  As far as the food: We started with a caviar course and enjoyed a bottle of Dom.  We did the full tasting menu with wine pairings for dinner and ended with a couple of souffle's.  I did the chocolate souffle and my bride-to-be the pistachio souffle. EVERYTHING we ate was spectacular!!!!!  I am not a fish fan, but the halibut that came as one of the courses in the tasting menu really was a to-die-for dish!   Service:  We were treated like a king & queen!  I couldn't have asked for anything better.. all of the restaurant personnel, from the waiters to the photographer were first class.  View & Atmosphere:  We were seated at the special corner table you see in all the pics.  It was special.. It was awesome!    Gripes: I really only have one.. and that is the markup for the champagne was atrocious by even Vegas standards.  But with that being said.. would I pay it again there? YUP!    Excluding the price of the champagne ($510 for 2002 bottle of Dom), I found there to be wonderful value to the rest of the meal.  I don't mind paying for service and quality.. and that is exactly what we got!!!!    I really can't recommend this restaurant enough.. especially if you are celebrating something special.  My fiance and I have actually decided to go back to Vegas to get married.. and we are going to be including the Eiffel Tower Restaurant in our wedding plans!",

I'm not sure if it was the high of just getting married (and the bottle of champagne we had before), but this place was PERFECT. We tried to eat at the steakhouse at The Cosmopolitan, but it was PACKED and the music was so loud we couldn't hear each other talk.  So we went over to Paris and we didn't have to wait long. The service was awful. Pretentious (though not shocking) and stuck up. We wanted to sit by the window, but they said it was reserved. There were four empty table by the window, none of which filled up the whole time we were dining.  Nonetheless, we didn't let it kill the mood. We ordered a delicious bottle of pinot noir (I forget which) and ordered the blue cheese souffle. It was AWESOME. So light, yet incredibly flavorful at the same time.   Dinner: I had the NY Steak with cranberry/bone marrow sauce on top. Seriously the best steak I've ever eaten in my life. It may have been the best meal I've ever had in my life. It was juicy and flavorful, perfectly cooked. My husband had a filet mignon with foie gras w/truffle oil. He raved about his meal too (I thought mine was better though).  All in all, the service got a dismal tip (my husband wrote a note on the receipt) but the meal was amazing and memorable!",

    "text": "I have to admit that I was ready for cheese, and not the classy fromage, French kind of way. However, there was nothing in the least bit tacky or cheesy about the Eiffel Tower Restaurant.  The elevator ride to the restaurant builds anticipation and a pristine, gorgeous open kitchen done up in white and copper greets you as you step off the elevator. Delicious smells and pastries on display hint at a delectable meal to come.  The atmosphere is perfect-moody reds and low lighting with spectacular views of the strip. Making a 5pm reservation guarantees a table near the windows, and the view of the Bellagio Fountains doing their choreographed dance was a reward for eating on the senior schedule (Though the 5pm timing did work perfectly in that it allowed for us to make Le Rev at 7pm at the Wynn without breaking a sweat). Seeing the fountains from above, in my opinion, was even more impressive as one could perceive the pattern of their movement in a different way.  The service was also stellar. Our waiter was attentive and present without being distracting or overbearing. He asked immediately if we had time constraints and worked to get us out with plenty of time, offering the souffle up front to ensure it was ready on time (I imagine they do this across the board, but I was psyched that he asked because I would have otherwise).  And the food....Oh, the food! I typically do not eat much bread (Nutritionist, endurance events, blah blah), but the baguette was well worth the splurge. It was just the right amount of sweet, was perfectly soft and yet flaky all at once. I'm not sure I've had better bread in France! The hubby, who is typically even more nutrition conscious than I am, had two slices!  I had the New York Steak and would have eaten every last bite, were I not saving room for dessert. It was the most perfect medium-well I've ever had, and the truffle sauce made it all the more delicious. I also sampled the crispy potatoes and the brussels sprouts. We joked that the potatoes we \"tots for grownups\" as they had a perfectly crispy shell but were the consistency of mashed potatoes inside. We may or may not have fought over the last one.The brussels sprouts, while not gaining points for health due to the fact that they are sauteed and served with bacon, were magically delicious.   The souffle was also perfect. We went with pistachio, which is certainly an unconventional choice, but it was remarkable. The nutty flavor of the pistachio balanced out the sweetness of the souffle. The Eiffel Tower Restaurant is certainly a slice of la bonne vie.  One item to note: If you're male, make sure you're wearing a collared shirt. I had a great time picking on my husband who elected to wear a swanky sweater without a collared shirt and was asked to borrow a jacket to wear.",

I was able to catch the show atleast 7 times before dinner was over.   This is a Truely romantic spot. very cozy and dim. The food was beyond excellent. the steak and chicken both simply melt in your mouth.  The surf n' turf is a great dish. So beautifully put together and just the right amount of food.  The farm raised chicken is also just as delicious.  Even though it is a bit pricey, it is deffinitely a great place to eat in Vegas. So if you are in Vegas for a special occasion, and you got some cash on you to spend, go to Paris, you wont regret it.   xoxo",

    "text": "I have a sweet spot for this restaurant, because my husband and I ate here the night after we were married. Mood lighting, delicious food, and the perfect view of the Bellagio water show made for a perfect honeymoon night.   Fast forward 3 years ... I'm back in Vegas and hungry for French food. Since my husband hates any restaurant that requires him to dress nicely, he graciously agreed to watch our toddler while my sister and I got our foodie on. I was worried that I wouldn't have the same great experience, seeing as I didn't have honeymoon magic to gloss over any imperfections the restaurant may have had the last time. I didn't have to worry at all.   They sat us right up against the window overlooking the Bellagio, and our waiter promptly arrived to take our drink orders. Although we were dying to get the chef's tasting menu again it was late, and we had a late lunch. Our waiter was attentive, helpful, and charming.... they had run out of the black cod that I wanted, but he apologized and assured me that I would not be disappointed with the halibut or sea bass.   He was right... the sea bass was delicious! Crispy skin and tender fish that matched perfectly with the smoked tomato quinoa and fennel shavings. Total heaven. This was a month ago, and I still think about that fish. I was full, but still had room for dessert. I ordered the passionfruit meringue, and it officially made my night. Tart passionfruit sorbet surrounded my light, fluffy meringue..... oh so good!!! I'm normally a creme brulee girl, but this dessert made me soo happy! The sweet and tart of the passionfruit woke me up and kept me going for the rest of the night.   Yes, the food is expensive. Yes, the portions are smaller than our bloated American senses are used to. But it's delicious, and the devil's in the details. I don't pay big bucks JUST for the food. I pay for the experience... a beautiful restaurant, great service, wonderful food, and a quiet moment with my sister. Always a good value in my book.",

Especially the part facing Bellagio, they have free water works, where you can see very well in the restaurant :]  Food was amazing, we've ordered the warm foi gras,...yeah never had one so good. Lamb chop entree was cooked just right. Beef wellington...well, I don't know how the european enjoys their meat...wasn't really my cup of tea but nevertheless was well flavored. My and my wife ended the night with the souffle and a meringue, both was ultra delicious.   Service was awesome, almost felt like a personal waiter standing by you. Also the washroom has a waiter handing out napkins...well i've never been to a high end restaurant that has that so this was interesting to me :P  The restaurant is ultra pricey but for its ultra tasty dish. Would recommend for a couple dinner. Doesn't feel like a family place...at least not worth it IMO.",

I was expecting fine dinning experience and the hospitality of this place is far from acceptable.  The waitress there cant stop telling us how we used the wrong knife for butter. Don't know to ask before taking the plate away to make sure we are done with that dish or not. She ended up offending the birthday person several times ('Fine Dinning'). Finally we asked the manager to give us a different waitress for the table. The manager after listening to all this said 'we don't have anyone else right now to replace her'. I at least expected that a manager of a so called fine dining should be able to take up the role of a waitress and resolve a situation like this.  Either ways, I am used to going to fine dining restaurants in San Diego and OC on a regular basis and this place needs a lot of training to reach the standards of the industry.",

The view is gorgeous with a perfect view of the bellagio fountains. We only had lunch, but I bet at dinner time, it's an amazing view.  - Cream of Mushroom Soup: creamy, smooth, perfect balanced flavor - Foie Gras wrapped in Duck Prosciutto with Fig Compote: mouthwatering, delicious, very smooth, melts in your mouth  - Moroccan Lamb Burger: flavorful, huge portion, chips okay - Seafood Salad: simple, refreshing, variety of seafood - Petit Fours: nice, light, sweet ending to a nice meal  Service was okay at first and the server warmed up to us at the end of the meal after he found out we were from San Francisco. He was, nonetheless, very attentive and polite throughout the meal. It was a very nice, relaxing lunch on our last day in Vegas despite an obnoxious French family that made a big fuss about seating arrangements. Overall, great food, service, and the view is gorgeous!",

It's difficult to find a mixture of both good food and a good view.  This place has the good food part down.  The appetizers teased us with their delicate flavors and each of our 6 entrees were fabulous; the steak, the fish, the duck, the lamb.  Especially the lamb.  We ordered 2 souffle desserts, a chocolate and a Grand Marnier.  The chocolate was the clear winner, however I don't think we would order these again.  The view leaves some to be desired.  The Eiffel Tower Restaurant is not at the top of the tower, it's on the equivalent of the 5th floor.  The windows are level with the top of the water from the Bellagio when the water show shoots up as high as it can.  The perimeter of the restaurant is comprised of tables for two which have panoramic views of the Las Vegas strip.  The center of the restaurant has larger tables for those that aren't on romantic dates.",

    "text": "This is an ultra-swanky - if not necessarily \"classy\" - upscale restaurant at the heart of the Strip.  I mean, how can a restaurant located on the landing of a fake Eiffel Tower in an amusement park hotel on the Strip in Las Vegas truly ever be considered classy? It couldn't. Anyhow, my dad, stepsister, her friend and I came here for dad's birthday a few weeks ago because he had always wanted to try it. You ride up an elevator to the restaurant and anti-climactically emerge into what amounts to the kitchen.  The layout of the restaurant is in tiers with booths facing out to the windows and a spectacular panoramic view of the Bellagio and its fountains.  The service is quite attentive, however the head waiter was just a tad bit creepy in his mannerisms and tone.  Now, the food is where this restaurant loses two stars because, although obviously quality ingredients, it just wasn't what you'd expect when you're laying out this kind of cash.  Appetizers were fair: Cynthia is right, the carpaccio is excellent, however, being a fan of fast food, it struck me as glorified Arby's meat.  I dunno. The scallop appie only came with two (for 20 bucks). The surf n' turf consisted of a very good fillet, but topped only with a small amount of baked crab meat, not the lobster tail that one would typically expect.  The sauces were just fair.  My stepsister's friend had the whole lobster, the presentation of which was odd: it was upside down and laid open on the plate, with spinach leaves and mushrooms tucked under the meat. Weird. Everything is a la carte, so you lay out more shells for the side dishes.  The potatoes au gratin were quite good, but the sauteed mushrooms a bit flavorless and gummy.  So all in all, have dinner here if its a super special occasion and someone else (such as dad) is footing the bill.",

Our server ,John Figlietti, was a True professional. He was timely,observant,informative and personable. My son had the salmon, judging by his smile, left little doubt as to how satisfied he was. I had the NY strip which was a generous proportion and perfectly prepared, absolutely delicious. As the restaurant started to fill up @ 1900 we were ordering desert. We found the close proximity of the window tables to be a plus. It allowed for brief exchanges with our neighbors who were enjoying the views as well. The entire evening was a pleasure !",

This is definitely not a \"fine\" Michellin-star dining experience.   The good: the view is quite good. You got a panorama view of the Bellagio fountains, though if you really want to see the fountain, Le Cirque and Picasso in Bellagio would have better views.   The unexpected: for such a touristy place, the food is actually quite decent. The bread is fresh and tasty; the drinks are well-made while not exceptional; my entree (cod) is tasty as well... typical good French cooking.  Overall I will not go back because it was so touristy. Le Cirque and Picasso are much better (also more expensive). I can see it being fun for some one who wanna go to a destination restaurant while having decent food.",

We heard a lot of good things about the pre-fix menu, and decided to  go with that for our meals. It was so much fun, having all 7 courses come to us! They have you order dessert at the beginning, so we both decided to go with souffles. My man got banana, and I (who normally orders anything with chocolate) ordered the Pistachio souffle!  They start you off with these little cheese puff things (can't remember the name) but they are divine! They taste just like puffed up Cheez-its.  Our first course was the amuse bouche.. Next they brought by a warm lobster salad, which if it weren't so delicious, i would have BATHED in it. It was that good. I still dream about that salad. Our third course was  (i think..) a cream of celery soup, which was heavenly. At this point, the water show had begun at the Bellagio, and our table had a perfect front row view of it! It was wonderful, sipping our soup, watching the water show.  Our fourth course was red snapper over braised vegetables.. They actually give you a generous portion of red snapper, too! Perfectly cooked and soooo flavorful.  Fifth course was venison with huckleberries and braised chestnuts.. Which I was SO excited for, having never tried venison until then. It was melt-in-your-mouth phenomenal.   Our 6th course that arrived was wine poached pear slices wrapped around camambert(sp?) cheese, served with warm cinnamon raisin bread... ohhhh my god.   Our last and final course (my stomach was BUSTING at this point) were our souffles.. which was up there with some of the best dessert I'd ever had. Our server brought us some assorted candies with our check, which was such a special treat, although I couldn't eat one last bit!  The service was prompt, professional, and very attentive! Our server was so much fun, he reminded me of my grandpa!   This is the perfect place to take your lover on a special occasion, and WELL worth the money. I *highly* recommend doing the pre-fix, you get so much food for your money, and you will leave STUFFED, i promise you!!",

Service is top notch, as it should be in a place like this.  The hubby is kind of a jokester and asks the waiter for \"their 2nd cheapest bottle of wine.\"  But the waiter was cool, it's not so stuffy that you feel out of place.  Wine was wonderful, my glass was always refilled, which is amazing because I can down the vino pretty quickly.  I had the surf and turf which I highly recommend.  The hubby had duck, which he enjoyed.  All the sides that our party ordered were excellent.  Definitely can be shared.  All pricey but worth it, plus the view speaks for itself.",

    "text": "Let me paint a picture of our evening.  Call to make reservations at Andre's, the French restaurant at another hotel.  Get a standard phone message, stating to leave time, date, and number for a reservation. I do as I was told, left said info, got all dressed up, walked across the street ( no easy feat, as you need to walk 2 blocks to do so) only to find out that the restaurant was closed for reservations.   Bummer, Big Time !! I'm all dressed up, and no French Restaurant, We start walking the strip, me in a funk, when all of a sudden, the BF's light-bulb goes off. Let's do Paris Hotel -- they got to have a Frog Restaurant there.  We wanted to do the Eiffel Tower anyway -- so Yeah--- I'm there.  We don't actually go to the top of the Eiffel Tower ( they want an extra $25 bucks or something close for the 2 of us), but we get off the elevator just short of the top.   Beautiful. Wow. Superb View.  The strip in all it's glory is before us.  No reservations -- No problem, as long as we're willing to sit toward the back, as all the window ( great view) tables have been reserved. A table in the back...sure, we're just happy to get in.  We're given a booth along the wall, which is high up on a platform, so you still get the night skyline.  Our wait staff comes in a procession.  First the water guy, then the busser who turns glasses...then our waiter. He is funny, charming, from Eastern Europe, and has just enough polish to pull off a high ticket restaurant without any pompousness.  We like him from the get.  The BF is starving, so our waiter suggests the Steak.  Done  I love rabbit and order the rabbit Napoleon.  A nice Cab for me, a frog beer for the BF -- we're happy people again.  The food was outstanding, the service even better. Romance was in the air, for sure.   Tre' Bon",

The server, Jorge, made our group feel extremely uncomfortable. From the moment we sat down you could tell he was not happy about serving us. The restaurant was not that busy since it was a Thursday night and past the dinner rush so he had no excuse for being so hasty with us. A couple sat at the table next to us and we could hear him fawn and flatter them while being completely curt when he came to our table. The food was delicious and the view was wonderful but we just felt so unwelcome. The busser ended up making the best impression on us and was always there to clear our dishes and refill our drinks. We ended up asking for the check before we even finished our entrees because we wanted to get out of there so badly. We didn't want to order dessert, more drinks, or anything. We just wanted to leave because the experience was THAT bad. We tipped the standard 20% hoping that some of it would eventually reach the busser. Looking back, I wish we would have just handed all the tip to the busser and none to our server. I hope they learn to not profile their guests and give everyone great service and not discriminate on age and ethnicity.",

While I'm glad we went for the experience, I doubt we will go here again...maybe in another 3-5 years.  This place is pricey, but it's warranted as the quality matches the price.  I had the rossini style filet mignon (I think that's what it was called) and it was crazy out of this world delicious. I salivate thinking about it even to this day. My fiance had the duck and he loved it. We had a glass of wine each and a pistachio souffle for dessert.  We had a table by the window and yes, it is a romantic restaurant, but I don't know what the hype is all about. It wasn't *that* spectacular.  Our server was nice but good grief, I did not care for the hard core sales vibe. He was pushing the upsell so hard it was a huge turnoff. I do not want to be pressured into eating specific things on a romantic evening out.  The other thing I didn't like is that you don't get to do the \"Eiffel Tower Experience\", you would have to go back downstairs and purchase tickets just like everybody else. You would think that spending hundreds of dollars on dinner would get you at least a discount, but sadly, they are too greedy for that.",

Once the elevator doors opened I was amazed. Looked so much fancier than the Mastros in Las Vegas and I would be comparing the food to it so I was not expecting much.  I ordered the Fillet Minon, my wife the rack of lamb and we ordered some sides. Sadly, I almost knocked off a star for this but even then it would still be 5 stars, they did not have creamed corn on my visit!!! I could not believe it. I got past it an waited for the food to arrive. I decided not to get any sauce for my steak and I was hoping that I did not make a mistake. We were served housebread and a cup of eggplant mix which was very good. The food arrived and I cut my first piece of steak.......OMG I though! Sorry Mastros, this place tops your steak and it didi not need any sauce to do it. It was cooked to perfection and the taste was amazing. I then tried the sides and the also blew away all of the Mastros sides I've had before EXCEPT the cream of corn which this place did not have. Th desert was also delicious! I highly recommend this place!",

Wonderful view, we had our dinner at 8pm reservation on a Saturday night and by that time, you get to watch the fountain show every fifteen minutes!   I ordered one of the tasting menu they offered. In fact, it's their proposal package! Comes with a bottle of champagne, a dozen of roses, personalized menu, photo in a frame...  Had an amazing time here!   The only mistake they made was they sat me at the wrong table, then asked me to go back to wait. But they were smart and gave us two free cocktails while we came back out to wait real quick.  Service was very good as well. The staff were very attentive with us throughout.   Food was good as we expected. Didn't expect any less from this restaurant.   If you google more about the restaurant, you will see a PDF file for special dinner or lunch menu and a proposal package.  Pricing range from $250-10,000 depending on what you are trying to do.",

Where they missed the mark was in regards to the service and the food. The waiter we had seemed preoccupied and wanted to rush us along, the assistant waiter lacked the basic professionalism one would expect from a $400 a table restaurant. He poured the bottled water from about a foot over our glasses which splashed both my wife and I every time he came around. He rolled his eyes at me when I asked him for a type of bread that he didn't have in the bread basket. The food was not the \"Out of this world\" experience we had previously read about. We had the Octopus appetizer (Great) the steak tartare appetizer (Great). My wife and I each had a filet, they were OK, but they didn't live up to the price in our opinions. The sides which were a la carte (Asparagus and Potatoes Au Gratin) were not hot when they made it to the table and were ridiculously small portions for $12 each. Overall, we would not recommend the Eiffel Tower Restaurant, especially with so many fantastic dining options in Vegas.",

Of course I ordered Beef Wellington because I have watched too many Gordon Ramsay shows. I liked it. The souffles were also very good and interesting. I liked the Pistachio one best.

A waiter with a faux french accent had taken their orders. We attempted to flag down Francois several times to no avail. I had to go to the bar myself to get a drink. 20 min later he came back with everyone else's food. He gave a faux apology and took my order, offering to rush my steak. I declined, not wanting to ruin a $50 entree. My New York steak came out pretty quickly. It was a good cut of meat, decently prepared, but nothing like Del Frisco's or the like.  I have no problem shelling out some coin for fine dining. However I expect service to come with the price tag.  If you want the view, take the tour and go have dinner at Van Gogh.",

The filet mignon with the red wine vinagrette marinade was beyond belief. It was as if 1,000 cherubs finished in my mouth!!!!  The place is dim, but has enough light to see your food and overlooking the Vegas strip is a damn near unbeatable backdrop. Also if you have a good seat you can clealy view the Bellagios water show. I'm pretty sure this restaurant has a sister location in Heaven!!! A MUST TRY next time ur in Vegas!!! BTW I brought my kids and didnt get a stink eye from the staff for doing so.

    "text": "Went here for my girlfriend's birthday. I made reservations about a week ahead of time asking them for a fountain side seat. They told me they couldn't guarantee my seat and said I should come early.  I recommend parking with the valet service at Paris. Either you or your date will be wearing something nice and heels so you probably won't want to walk in those. The self parking lot is pretty darn far away (about a 7 minute walk) so skimping on the valet tip isn't worth it.   We got the following:   +pea soup (6.5/10) Very distinct taste. Came with some fish which was very delicious.  +foie gras (7/10) portion was very small but delicious. It was very flavorful but a bit on the salty side.  +blue cheese souffle (7/10) Delicious. The souffle was scrumptious.  +lamb chops (9/10) M girlfriend said this is the best lamp she's ever had.  +chocolate souffle (9/10) Very delicious and full of chocolate flavor. Our server poked holes into the souffle and then pour chocolate syrup inside.  +espresso  Our total came out to $132.42. A great deal for a good view, fine dining and a relaxing atmosphere.   I'd have to say the lamb was very delicious. My girlfriend said that it was the best lamb she's ever had. I thought it was pretty good myself. It was flavorful and not very gamy.  I read a few other reviews commenting that the lamb was a bit tough. My girlfriend and I like our meat rare so I asked the waiter to serve it as rare as they could get away with.   The blue cheese souffle was pretty good but not as good as the chocolate souffle. We ordered it early so we'd get it after our lamb chops.   The entire dinner was roughly 2 hours. I'd give yourself 2 hours if in case you're budgeting your time. We had a Cirque du Soliel to run to so we paced ourselves to leave in 1 hour and 45 minutes.   We sat at the very corner seat closest to the Bellagio fountains. We are from 700-900 and saw at least 5 fountain shows. I think this place has the best fountain shows. I'd definitely recommend this place for special occasions.",

When you do they will respond and ask you if you have any preferences, whether or not you'll be celebrating anything and would like to know if you want win/champagne or even a rose on your table which is nice. The view was great, we had a half circled table facing the water show at the Bellagio, The server (Rebecca) was awesome, really outgoing and over all made our dining experience even better since she was personable. The food was about the best french cuisine I've ever had, I ordered a New York steak, my wife got the filet mignon, Of course we got the veggies and potatoes etc but what really sealed the deal for us was the caramel souffle. They also have a photographer that will take a picture at your table or with a view of outside that charges $25 for the picture (price is tacked onto your bill) so you can expect to spend close to $300 or so with a few drinks, your meal and the picture not including the tip. Overall though you are paying for a really good meal and an experience which makes it all worthwhile.",

My wife and I went here for our anniversary.  Our seats were next to the window.  So, it was rather nice.  We oversaw the Bellagio fountains.  I wished they could open the windows so we could have the chance to listen to the music.  Oh well.  As for the environment, it is a very cozy and romantic place.  However, I would say that the negative is that you are within a foot or two from the next table.  There was very limited space to manuever.  As for the service, no better word than Excellent.  As for the food, we had the seafood sampler.  My wife and I ordered somewhat the same thing in Scottland, England and expected a similiar presentation.  But, the results was truly different.  It was 1/4 of the size in a oversized ice-cup.  Granted, the seafood was fresh, but we were expecting MORE... Oh well...  I ordered the T-bone steak and she had the duck.  Steak was ok and the duck was a bit over cooked.  We shared a chocolate cake together ~ too sweet....   In summmary, compared to the other high-end restaurants, this was a bit disappointing.  If it was not for the view of the Bellagio fountains, I would have rated it much lower.",

    "text": "I don't have the Joel Robuchon dollaz quite yet but I still wanted bougie food to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. Most of Yelp's reviews are good, praising the food. Any bad reviews are attributed to bad service. I ate there on a Monday night (7/5) and the service was great! When we first got there, the table wasn't ready, so we waited in the bar which was dark but I felt sexy just sitting there. We got seated in front of the window, the Bellagio fountain show is great for filling awkward silence. Our waiter greeted us and he was very friendly, although he started out with an Irish accent and by the end of the meal it was Van Damme/George St. Pierre.   We ordered:  -Foie Gras with braised bing cherries -Sea bass with tomato quinoa (I've never had quinoa so delicious) -Beef wellington (good sized portion, we left with take home) -Crispy Pomme Dauphines (the serving size is a lot for 2 people) -chocolate souffle for dessert  We also ordered 3 cocktails and our bill came out to about $180. Considering it's Las Vegas and a bottle of water will cost you $2.50, our bill wasn't bad. The food was good, the view was great, service is friendly. The only thing was we didn't get a special birthday treat for the birthday boy so I'll knock off a star for that.  Don't forget to: -Dress up -Make reservation -Order a souffle in the beginning",

    "text": "We went to this restaurant for our 10 year anniversary. It is a hype restaurant and it comes with everything you'd expect in an expensive, centrally located restaurant with a theme.  The view of the Bellagio fountains is very cool and definitely enhances your overall dining experience but it does come with a price tag. We had the seafood appetizer which was beautifully presented and very tasty. The main course was good but not the best I've had (I went for steak and my husband ordered pheasant), and then we had souffle for dessert. Plus, a bottle of wine to top the bill.  The souffle was good and the selection of flavors is overwhelming. It does take 40 minutes to make so I highly recommend ordering in advance - unless you are planning to spend 3 hours dining.  You can get a picture taken and printed out ($24) and you can get a rose for your date on your way back from the bathroom (at least, that's what my husband did).  It's romantic and very nice, with good service and a pleasant view.  But there's one thing it's not... and that is it is not the best restaurant in Vegas.",

Our waiter was always there and never went MIA. The wine list was a bit intimidating, given the amazing high-end wines comprising their cellar, but we were able to tell the waiter our preferences and price point, and not only did he gladly made a recommendation, but he verified that choice with the sommelier and came back with a different option, which was outstanding.   I had the beef Wellington, and my wife had the filet mignon with berneaise sauce. Both were outstanding. We further finished the meal with souffles, mine pistachio and hers caramel. Again both terrific.   In addition to the great food and service, the view is spectacular. We had a window table overlooking the Bellagio fountains, which was an amazing addition to the already spectacular experience.",

This melange (or mixture) is a sure-fire recipe for an enchanting experience. We reserved ahead for a late lunch and were shown immediately to a primo view table.  If you dine here often, the restaurant does keep track of your preferences, so do let them know what you like, or if it is a special occassion!  We had eaten here several times including our wedding dinner right after we got married (in Las Vegas, of course) and had a breathtaking view of the Bellagio fountains at night!  We were treated to a chocolate souffle with \"Congratulations\" written on the plate, and a toast of champagne!  The people around us joined in, and made it a party! This time, a quiet lunch was in order, and we enjoyed the Friday afternoon ambience.  I ordered a Sauvignon Blanc wine to start, and was up for brunch.  The lobster Eggs Benedict dish was a marvel.  Sweet, tender lobster, including the claw, slathered with pillowy freshly made Hollandaise sauce, all sprinkled with micro-greens.  This dish made me a convert to brunch food!  My honey got the Salmon Paillard, and enjoyed the tangy pepper and lemon combination.  We reveled in the view, and the atmosphere, feeling transported to a French time and place.",

Had not counted on the slew of patrons on route to the same destination; Eiffel Tower restaurant. Strangers all of us, we nodded politely waiting patiently without a brawl. Not wishing to be late for our reservations, we actually started our trek quite early and it paid off, somewhat.  Stepping out of the elevator, one can see the open kitchen through a large pane glass, everyone hard at work. Making our way to the Hostess, the stately bar on the left is grandiose. *heart eyes* Please see photo.  On to the Evening! Amazing experience worth every moments breathe. The beautiful setting, top view, and service lends itself to be a delight. My favorite view was the gorgeous bar that overwhelms you as you walk in; a True tremendous sight!  We were a party of 4 and celebrating Vegas. Therefore our excitement ran high. So Champagne wishes were first in line ;) Although we had reservations, no tables by the windows were available, boo hoo. Nevertheless we had a delightful meal through and through. The service is remarkable as we had several people looking after our table.   We opted for the pre-fix dinner and added wine pairing. From beginning to end, the food seemed to be never-ending and the wines generously poured. Please see Photo Although we had a starter dish, there was a preamble amuse-bouche of cool cream of celery...very tasty and wonderful start, Followed by the aforementioned trio of a starter dish. Please see Photo  *Foie Gras-was delightful and delicious sitting atop of chopped pear and drizzled with a luscious wine reduction. I was pleasantly surprised by the generous portion. *Seared Scallop-Although not a fan of scallops, this dish was pleasantly gratifying. Seared and seasoned perfectly.  *Venison-Bone in venison was tasty and not gamey. Accompanied by delectable wild mushrooms, I could have eaten 2...Oh wait! I did eat 2 as the Wifey passed it on to me ;)  Score! The evening came to a close but not before dessert. Unable to choose between the scrumptious Souffles available, all 4 flavors were ordered for the table! Pistachio, Chocolate, Grand Marnier, (my fav) and Classic. We were all quite stuffed and rolled out beautifully.   An enjoyable evening altogether. Why 4 stars then? Having arrived 10 minutes early for our reservation, we were not seated until 20 minutes past our rez. 30 minutes of watching. Don't blame them for the first 10 minutes of course, but it was obviously an overbooking issue. So we waited at the banquet bench available. We did enjoy and shall return. Don't forget to use the Yelp check-in offer!  Try Eiffel out for yourself and see what you think. Thank you for reading =)",

We went to the Champagne Brunch on a Saturday morning, and it was not very busy at all. We were lucky to get a window view at these cute two person table. It was quite romantic, and the view was breathtaking. We enjoyed the Creme Brulee French Toast / Alsace Apple Strudel / Iron Steak topped with fried egg and Yukon Potatoes / and Cremant d'Alsace Brut Mimosas - blackberry, and passion fruit mimosas. It was amazing champagne at $20 a drink. Pretty fancy French experience and truly glad we went through with our reservation- It was easy to make and change our reservation on open table.

After a long weekend i made a reservation at this beautiful place for a girls only brunch. Upon arrival into the Paris casino look for the elevator and host stand in the center... thats the only way up. Keep your eyes open because the ride up is super cool.. u can see the inside of the tower. The doors open to... the kitchen?? Yea, it was weird. There wasnt anyone to tell me where to go nor a sign. I took it upon myself to just walk around and i found the host stand. I was warmly greeted and sat at a booth facing the Bellagio fountains. TIP: its easy to get this AWESOME view during brunch, but special requests must be made and im guessing extreme \"greasing\" needs to happen to get it for dinner. Definitly call ahead to get the view.  My group of 3 ordered mimosas, they have several kinds, all made with real champagne, not that sparkling wine crap. I opted for Peach and my friends had blackberry and watermelon. All made with puree, not syrup. They are delicious and go down easy, but keep in mind they are $20 each. Definitly get one, or 2, but maybe not 3 cause of the price lol  The food.. o the delicious choices. We started with the french cheese platter (duh). It was exactly what you would expect.  It was delicious but i will say, a little small. The bread (of course) was fresh and delicious. I opted to try their french onion soup because its very different from others. They add cream and puree it all together. I could eat that stuff everyday-so flavorful and aromatic.  We literally couldnt decide on entrees. I had the steak and eggs, my girls had the smoked salmon waffle and the stuffed french toast. We all wanted to try the BLT tower. We were in a tower and figured we should get it, so in addition to our own meals, we got the tower for the table. Hey.. its vegas! I dont even feel like i need to tell you...YUM. Seriously.. this place is legit. My steak was cooked perfectly. Its placed ontop of over easy eggs and thats ontop of a potato mushroom hash. I was told the smoked salmon was the best she had ever had.. and the noises that were coming out of my friend while she ate the french toast were almost inappropriate. The tower was cool. In the end it was just a delicious blt with avocado, but it was delicious.  Even tho it was brunch we, of course, had to get dessert. We had the famous creme brulee,  molten chocolate lava cake, strawberry ice cream souflee and they also gave us free chocolate mousse.  It was crazy. You could literally just go there for dessert.    The service was 5 star. They even cleaned crumbs off the table without missing a beat. Our waiter was knowledgeable and very personable.  The food is amazeballs. The view is spectacular.  Why are you still reading this... get over there and experience it for yourself.  Ps.. brunch was about $300 with tip for 3 people. But ya know.. its vegas. $$$$$ totally worth it.",

A+ - Foie and Truffle Filet - boy did I indulged, flavor explosion! It is absolutely everything I want in a perfect bite. The fatty foie add a great umph to the steak.  Highly recommended  A- : Warm lobster salad - hardly a salad, just lumps of warm quality lobster meat  B+: Duck foie gras torchon - I realize I am a fan of seared foie instead of cold but nonetheless, still a flavorful dish  B: Salmon - nicely crusted on the top, provided good texture  B+: Wellington - this is what they were known for which was pretty good.  I enjoyed the flakey crust and the sauce that went with it  A: Milk fed veal - I feel bad everytime I eat this but oh so soft and tender, another highly recommended dish  A- Souffle - very moist   The view was lovely, you can watch the water show across the street if you request for a window table.  As \"corny\" as Paris may sound in Vegas, I had a lovely time :)",

The service here was impeccable. We were seated no more than five minutes after checking in downstairs at the entrance to the elevators. Our waiter was very friendly and incredibly attentive, making sure that absolutely everything was to our liking. I had the venison medallions when I visited, which were amazing. The meat was very tender and perfectly paired with vegetables, pumpkin gnocchi, braised cabbage, and huckleberry jus. This is definitely a pricier dining experience, but worth every penny.",

The service was impeccable and the sommelier helped choose a Chateauneuf-du-pape which we enjoyed.  To the food... just... yum!  Started with the steak tartare which is right up there with some of the best I've had.  Also had the king crab salad which was flavored / spiced well that it didn't just seem like an ordinary salad (which it shouldn't be for that price).    I believe the table orders were the salmon, the filet and the new york steak.  Most were cooked as requested though the New York was a little less cooked than my friend requested.  I had the beef wellington and it was delish!  Be careful not to put the sauce on top otherwise it will get soggy.    Finished the night with a complimentary dessert for my mom (she's diabetic so the rest of us enjoyed it)... and with a picture with the Paris balloon in the background.  All in all... a great meal/experience!",

We arrived and checked in, grabbed a seat at the bar and enjoyed a cocktail while we waited for our table to be ready, we only waited just long enough to finish one cocktail, the timing was perfect.  It was a Saturday night around 7 so the restaurant was swamped , but that didn't slow down our experience one bit. The server was prompt, very prompt, she grabbed our drink order and off she went. When she returned we placed our food order, all the time joking and having a great time with us. We were unwinding from the hellish week of SEMA/AAPEX. The apps arrived quickly and were all delicious, everything was perfect up to this point. The entrees arrived shortly after we finished our appetizers, the server had planned this perfectly . Out entrees were prepared perfectly and everyone was thrilled with the food.  The Eiffel Towel is a little bit ore expensive then the typical strip restaurant , but I can assure you that it is worth every penny. I cannot wait to return to Vegas to do it all over again.",

The flavor just wasn't there and the chorizo was chopped, which is weird. The potatoes it was served with were just OK. The eggs were nicely cooked and the sauce was pretty good. I think the food should warrant 3 stars considering the reputation, and mine was only 2 stars.   Our party of 3 had different opinions of the food. My sister said her club sandwich (with avocado!) was the best ever. I tasted it and it was good. We were there for lunch and entrees are around $20. They also served an amuse bouche of mushroom soup that was excellent as well as french bread. After our meal, our server asked how the food was and I told him my thoughts on the benedict. He said he agreed that it's not the best but can't tell people that. Alrighty then. Our view of the fountains was awesome. The bar is pretty big and is at the center of the restaurant.  Maybe skip the food and enjoy a martini while the fountains do their thing in the background.",

What a great view at night of the strip and Las Vegas Casinos!  Just for that it was incredible!  Because of the view it made you want to stay there all night!   The food was really delicious and has something for everybody and came to our table in a timely manner and the staff was very aware of what we needed and when and very professional.  I recommend it as a great place to take a loved one, date, or your future husband or wife! :)  You also might go to the lookout deck on the top, but do at night!!  Incredible!  A must!!!!  Wine and Dine!  All The way!",

    "text": "It wouldn't make sense to leave 1 or 2 stars - unless you are one lucky winner of a catastrophic incident here - but you really gotta earn the 4 or the 5.   Other reviews touch on the feeling of being pressured / \"up-sold,\" and those feelings are not without merit. From the minute you make reservations (\"Would you like to upgrade with long-stem roses, yada and/or yada?!\"), you're reminded that you're [by choice] entering an upscale \"fine\" restaurant within an already over-priced money-pit known as Las Vegas. But hey, you're here cause you want to be here, right? It's not like you're not going in with your eyes open - at least, hopefully...  You're paying for the location, the view [especially if you can land a spot at the window right in front of the Bellagio fountains], the novelty of being in a half-scale Eiffel Tower in the middle of Las Vegas Blvd, and oh yeah, food & drink that isn't terrible. Over-priced? Of course! But again, eyes open & you'll appreciate the experience (unless you can't swing minimum $100 / person, then hey no worries, just go to one of the 9 billion other [maybe even better!] places just a stone's throw away)... definitely a \"one and done\" though, too many other places tempting my curiosity for future trips.   PS - one guy who did NOT make us feel pushed around was a waiter named Will (you'll feel like you have about 10 waiters minimum, lol) - nice guy who navigated the balance of what I assume is a high-pressure \"sales\" job vs. enabling the customer to still feel 'in control' - kudos!",

We had reservations but showed up almost half hour early and they were able to seat us right away, and we got table by the window overlooking Bellagio fountains. They provide great service, you are treated as a royalty. Not only at the table but in the rest room too! Nice lady was helping with getting the door for you as well as paper towels for your hands. Our server was attentive too. Food was amazing! We had non traditional caesar salad, lobster bisque, Rossini style filet mignon with foie gras and  potatoe Anna.

This place did not disappoint, from Food to the view and the exceptional service everything was 5 stars.. from the moment we checked in at the elevator to go up..everyone knew it was our Anniversary.  The food is excellent also and the service was impeccable, water never went empty, was always checked on at the time! Again this place was awesome and I will def be back next time we are in town.. kudos to Eiffel Tower for standing up to the big boys on the block and holding your own!  See the pics of the food! And BTW the souffle is a must order however it takes time to prepare so make sure u order it before your meal starts.  Thanks for making a great one for us!",

    "text": "Eiffel Tower is, by far, one of the best fine dining experiences in the US. I have to frequent a lot of different five star restaurants for my job (I know, tough life) and had accumulated a ton of Lettuce Entertain You points that I wasn't aware I had, so I figured my girlfriends and I would blow it all on a great meal during our girls weekend.   As others have stated, you just can't beat the ambiance. It's a beautiful setup filled with tables that aren't too close to one another, and servers that know the menu like the back of their hand. The hostess was super lovely when I asked to push our reservation 30 minutes later. Knowing it's an extremely busy restaurant with a long line of walk-ins, I was grateful for accommodation. Our server was fantastic, quick with the wit and knowledgeable on all menu items.   We started off with the seafood tower, and followed up with a rack of lamb + scallops + a filet. We also had a side of the wild mushrooms and asparagus. And too many drinks, of course (it's Vegas!)  The lamb was, without any exaggeration, the best meat I've had in years. Cooked perfectly (pictures to follow) and presented beautifully. The seafood tower did not skimp on the seafood like some restaurants do - the crab legs and lobster portions were enormous and the clams, etc were also generous. The filet was delicious and the sides couldn't have been better.  That's a dining experience I won't soon forget. We usually try to mix it up and try different restaurants/hotels for our annual trip, but I don't think any of us are willing to go elsewhere after this past Saturday.",

The views are wonderful and if you request it or get lucky, they will seat you on the side where the window is facing Bellagio and you have the best front row seats of their water show. This restaurant is beautiful whether you come for lunch or dinner.  The views are just stunning. Highly recommended during your trip to Vegas!  They started us off with a drink menu and then with 4 different kinds of breads.   We had a scallop appetizer which was delicious - it was very well seasoned and cooked as well as presented.   For my main dish I had ordered the lamp chops and I would highly recommend anyone else who loves tender and flavorful meat to give it a try. It was definitely worth it.  After the dinner, if you ask for a picture, the staff definitely knows the perfect spot to place you for the perfect picture! They will have you stand just where you can see the words \"Paris\" on the airballon behind you. :)",

The steaks (ordered medium rare) were all close to well done, they forgot a friend's drink order, and worst of all, a souffle was ordered early in the night (since they take half an hour to cook) which was completely forgotten, so no souffle was had. The food overall is not bad but it's no where near as good as it should be for the price. My guess is the other reviewers haven't tried the better places in Vegas.  As an added bonus several of the people in my group had horrible upset stomachs after the meal, lots of Imodium was required.",

Way too loud, way too busy, way too crazy. The view- great, although the Bellagio fountains were off due to wind. If that is a deal breaker, check the weather forecast. 20 mph winds or greater, no fountains. Service- great. Our guy was very attentive. Value- this is what makes this a 3 star. The prices are way high. I've had ribeye steaks before in tins of places all over the US. I've been to dives and been to 5 stars. $89 ala carte for this cut of beef was too much. The petite filet was $60. Dry aged for 18 days still does not make that price stick.  So in a nutshell. Good food. Too loud and too expensive",

Each employee we spoke to was very knowledgeable about the menu and their wine selection, which is very impressive to me. Our dessert was ordered ahead of time because the waiter informed us that it takes 20-25 minutes to prepare. There was an issue in the kitchen, which caused our dessert to be late. They did not charge us for the dessert AND they brought an additional dessert since we were celebrating a birthday. They also came by with a sample serving tray of desserts, and allowed us to try any of the treats we wanted. From the beginning of our adventure, when the waiter placed our napkins in our laps, until the end, when the staff brought our check in a timely manner, we were in awe. The concern with detail was noticed and appreciated. This dining experience was one for the books. The creamed spinach was amazing, as well as the lobster.

We where not given a table because we only wanted to order dessert so they canceled our reservation when we got there and told us we had to sit at the bar. Upon entering the kitchen a chef was leaning on the Expo counter. Other guests received dessert petit fours we did not. And to top off the night they did not write happy anniversary on the plate (I was hoping they would when I told them it was our anniversary when making the reservation, and saw happy birthday on a plate that went by the bar ). Overall the impression I received from Eiffel Tower Restaurant was that they did not have to care because they have a nice view.  *also this is airing on the picky side but after each song that plays there is hand clapping that plays on the speakers (I found it super tacky but maybe some people like it)",

    "text": "The Good  My husband and I had dinner here two days ago to celebrate our first anniversary.  He called to reserve an 8:00 dinner at which he was specifically asked whether he was celebrating a particular occasion; during which he stated, \"Our anniversary\".  At check-in, we were greeted with, \"Happy Anniversary\".  We arrived and were seated at a window table for two with a spectacular view of the Strip and Bellagio Fountains' water show.  While watching the water show, I ordered a Cosmopolitan, Spring Water, and Non-Traditional Caesar Salad with Anchovies, Capers, and Garlic.  We were also given a choice of three breads: Sourdough, French Baguette, or Whole Wheat.  We both selected the Sourdough and French Baguette, and were pleased.    For the entrees, he ordered the Char-Broiled Filet Mignon (prepared Medium Rare), Rossini Style, with Foie Gras and Truffle Sauce - it was absolutely delicious.  I originally ordered the Beef Wellington, but we were pressed for time (for our 9:30 Zumanity show at New York-New York) after our waiter indicated it could take in excess of 45 minutes to cook, so I subsequently ordered the Roasted Rack of Lamb (prepared Medium) with Tomato Tart and Tarragon Jus - it too was delicious.    After dinner, I finished the Cosmopolitan - it was one of the best Cosmos I have ever experienced.  The Bad  Our waiter attempted up-sell at every moment.  While deciding on our dinner selections, we asked him about an appetizer, he suggested the highest priced appetizer.  When we asked him about soup or salad, he suggested one of the highest priced items, and when we inquired about the entrees, he, of course, suggested the highest priced entree.  As we were celebrating our anniversary, our waiter never once mentioned it.  We never received an \"Anniversary\" dessert or anything close to it.  Although we were slightly pressed for time, our waiter did not even suggest a to-go dessert.    The Ugly  We received absolutely nothing for deciding to celebrate our anniversary at Eiffel Tower Restaurant.  We would have gladly paid more than our $200 bill to have received much better service.",

    "text": "I really enjoy reading peoples complaints about excellent restaurants. Most of them are unfounded rants without any knowledge of the art of cuisine. I often wonder if they ever even been to the restaurant. as for me I have been to the Eiffel Tower Restaurant on a few occasions with my significant other. Each occasion costing upwards 400$ and worth every penny.   Aside from the romantic setting and views of this restaurant you have perhaps some of the best service every experienced in a restaurant setting. Yes, of course it's pricy but you get what you pay for. From the minute you enter you are catered to, from jacket hanging to chair setting you are the boss at this restaurant. The treatment continues throughout the evening such that if you are on a date or with the one you love you are fully credited for the great experience.   Now, for the food, each course is an experience. From salads that leave you begging for more to prime cuts of steak that melt in your mouth. Desserts are the cu de gra.  For a wonderful and satisfying experience try this restaurant you won't be disappointed.   Suggestions: make reservations in advance, request a window table center and bring a date you are planning a serious relationship with (this is not a McDonalds date environment).",

    "text": "Overall a fantastic experience. We came in for lunch as we previewed the menu and wanted something that was no longer available, but we still managed a great experience. We were greeted by a french hostess and were escorted up the elevator, and then seated with a breathtaking view of the Strip and Bellagio fountains. They were not running, but still a great view none the less. Our server was also french and beyond kind and helpful. Talk about a True \"Paris\" experience!  The amuse bouche was a simple cauliflower cold soup (?) and was amazing! The wine menu was impressive and boasted wonderful French wines, or French-inspired. Go figure, in a classy place like this! They nailed it on the head for what they are trying to sell.  We had the Composition of French Cheeses as our appetizer. My favorite was the bleu cheese drizzled with honey comb. YUM! And this appetizer was perfectly paired with our wine choice. The name of the wine is elusive to me now, but it was a great french wine that I would love to have again.  I had the Ocean Seafood Salad. WOW! Delicious! Everything I ever hoped and dreamed! Words cannot explain the orgasm that happened among my taste buds. An amazing mouth orgy of ecstasy. I have been dreaming about this dish ever since. All of these tasty chunks of seafood nestled among greens, served with lemon (which I loved and squeezed all over everything) and a French Cocktail Sauce which I drizzled on top and seriously order this you will not be disappointed...  My wonderful other half (whose idea it was to take me here in the first place, well played my dear) ordered the Aged Parmesan Crusted Chicken. It was delightfully sizzling upon presentation and a generous portion. Although it was not the most amazing chicken he has ever tasted, it was very good. I would call this a high class pounded and fried chicken, and I would have to say this would be good on a hunk of bread with some mayo and lettuce. Sorry, just not the best ever.  Our dessert was Creme Brulee. Sadly, I was disappointed in this dessert as it is usually one of my favorites. I liked the same dessert in the downstairs buffet better. I would not order this again but I would try another tasty treat. After dessert we were offered some caramel and fruit things which were delightful.  I would absolutely (and can't wait to) return again. I would like to try for dinner as well. The overall experience was pretty authentic and even though not all of the food was top notch, I think they deserve 5 stars.",

    "text": "There really couldn't have been a better 'moment of truth' than when the elevator opened up to an immaculate kitchen with the brigade prepping, firing, and plating all the decedent entrees. This set the tone for the dining experience.  Unfortunately I wasn't here to have dinner. I had just met up with my former casino professor turned good friend, and we were thirsty.   We sat at the bar in a way where we could overlook the LV Boulevard and the Bellagio fountains. As many of the other reviews state, the view is exceptional. A perfect date spot with that special someone. However, we were here to get lit. He started with some gin martini, I went for the manhattan on the rocks. At $20 a pop it doesn't come cheap, but if you were to imagine the perfect manhattan, this would surely be it. After a couple drinks each we were feeling all warm and fuzzy.  We ordered the French cheese board and crab salad to hold us over. The cheeses were phenomenal! I don't recall exactly what cheeses they were, but they covered a broad spectrum of cheeses. From bold and pungent, to creamy and luscious. The bartender also supplied us with plenty of extra crostinis to accompany our cheeses. We also had the crab salad. The crab was so sweet and wrapped in thinly sliced cucumbers, and surrounded by a small bed of greens. Definitely not filling at all, but a nice treat.  Overall a good experience. Pricey, but worth it. Bon appetit!",

We walked right up without any reservation around noon on a Friday, and we were escorted to a seat right on the window to see the fountains of Bellagio. After ordering, we were treated to an amuse bouche of a chilled tomato and cucumber soup.  It was so light and refreshing.   We both started with the French Onion soup.  Now, I have had A LOT of French Onion soup in Paris (some good and some bad), and I make a mean version myself.  This was by far the most unique version I have ever had.  It was creamy.  There was no heavy cover of cheese, and there was not an actual onion in sight. BUT, amazingly, they captured the flavor of French Onion Soup.  It was accompanied by a parmesan crisp.  I really, really enjoyed it. I had an endive and goat cheese salad which was light and refreshing.  My husband ordered the French BLT tower, and it was more food than he could finish.  Also, very good.  We skipped dessert since we were headed to the MGM pool for the afternoon. The service as polite, but  little bumpy.  Our waiter tripped over a wine bucket that made a terrible clash, but all in all, it was a very good experience for a bargain price in Vegas.",

Believe people when they say to dress up!  I'm SO GLAD I didn't wear my jeans - which we do ALL the time in SF.  But not to fret, I still felt their disapproval at my fleece pullover so snooty-rep intact!  Sis was also put in her place when she asked for a glass of Pinot & didn't specify Noir.  Gee, I'm sorry but here in Wine Country, Pinot *always* implies Noir  But fake, facetious \"french\" snootiness aside, we enjoyed our meal  Starters included the Blue Cheese Souffle & let me just say this place knows how to make one mean souffle!  Light as air & just a hint of blue cheese flavor (could have been a bit more pungent but was still a fan)  Entrees were the one & only veggie dish they offered - the veggie crepe.  Sis loved it but I was completely turned off by the abundance of lemon  What did absolutely rock my world however was this Mushroom Spaetzle we got as a sidedish.  I could have had about 2 of these as a main course & been totally satiated.  Earthy, mushroomy, & tender pasta-like spaetzle.....absolutely delish!  Desserts included the Banana Souffle for Sis & Pumpkin Souffle for me.  We each thought ours was the best of the 2 & again, we're greeted w/ the lightest, airiest, souffle w/ just a hint of banana or pumpkin  Was hoping they'd be paired w/ something other than Creme Anglaise - like maybe a caramel pairing for the banana & a chocolate for the pumpkin but the anglaise was still tasty & didn't take away too much from our devouring  People all around us were celebrating 1 thing or another - a couple on one side of us was celebrating a birthday & then this other couple was celebrating their very first Mommy-Son date night; and this other couple sitting right beside us got engaged right there while we were having dinner.  So much love & excitement!     And this is all while overlooking the Bellagio Fountains.....would totally come back for the ambiance & maybe dessert!  Overall, food - 3 Stars; staff - 2 Stars; atmosphere - 5 Stars.....averaging = 3 Stars",

Too bad we were seated all the way on the other side of the restaurant with no view . Service was so-so, waiters felt a little rushed due to how busy it was that night. Ordered the crab and avocado appetizer to share and that was delish!!! Don't typically like crab dishes but it came recommended by our waitress and was pretty happy with the choice. Hubby got the \"queen\" filet with green peppercorn sauce and I got the beef Wellington. Not wowed by my dish although the serving size was huge, but did enjoy the bite of filet I stole from my hubby's plate. Lastly, in order to have the souffle for dessert, you must order 25-30 min in advance, so we basically were forced to look at the dessert menu as soon as we placed our order for our meal which was weird. We got the Nutella souffle which was only okay. All in all, I don't see myself returning here since there are a ton of better places to eat in Vegas...",

Just as we were finishing our bread at our beautiful window table, we see a cockroach on the window. We immediately flag down our waiter, who fumbles around to find something to kill it but the cockroach runs off. Our waiter then pats me on the back and says, \"Don't worry. It won't kill you.\" Then the restaurant lost power while I was in the bathroom. So when I tried to wash my soapy hands, I couldn't because the faucet sensors weren't working. I asked the bar staff for water to rinse the soap off and after waiting for 15 mins, I just used the water we were drinking. We couldn't order soda or dessert because there was no power. DO NOT RECOMMEND.",

She made reservation months in advance so dinner was set for four.  It was a busy night as we enter into what looked to be a bar/entrance to the restaurant.  There, we were acknowledged and were said to wait until our table was ready.  We sat near the bar and to our non expectation, nobody came to take our orders.  One of my dear friend had to hop onto the bar and asked to be served with cocktails.    I got the pink velvet.  That was awesomely refreshing alochol drink that hit just the right spot.  The other flavors were gin and tonic and martini by the guys.  Low and behold, we were finally seated a not so great table but nonetheless, overlooking a post wedding dinner and a family celebration. Oh well.  Our waiter for the night was nice and pleasant. Got our menu as well as our order of the the fine wine that we all love Cab.  Cost us $155.  It was exquisite and worth every penny.  My table had the usual, foie gras and meat was the order of the night.  I went for the braised shortribs.  Very tender and delish. The lamb and the muscovy duck were good I was told by my eating companions that complimented very well with our wine.    To end the night, we four shared two souffles--chocolate and pistacchio.  I preferred the chocolate.  Overall, a great night of food with wonderful friends.  A romantic night out with a great couple. Nice ambience. Tab was steep but well worth it. Hey, we are in Vegas so we should eat like one--at least once in a while.",

We came with no reservations and had to wait about 10 minutes, but where we were seated had an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains.   Quick tip on drinks - the nonalcoholic drinks are yummy but have a tad too much syrup in them. Ask for club soda to be mixed in to make it less overpowering.   We started with the creamy French Onion soup - I've never had french onion soup in this form (creamy) before but it was really yummy.   Next  we ordered the ocean seafood salad (lobster, shrimp, crab) to share. It came pre-tossed with really delicious dressing. All the ingredients were super fresh and it was a pretty large serving (do share with someone if this is not your main course).   Finally we ordered the Petite New York Strip steak with cabernet butter - yum! I usually like my meat cooked medium, but this could have been a little rarer. The flavors were great and the cabernet butter went perfectly with the steak.   Service was impeccable and the servers were all speedy and very helpful. I'd definitely recommend this restaurant for lunch.",

Fabulous views of the Bellagio fountain show if you dine after 3pm. Very romantic setting. Attentive and polite service.   I had a garden salad and the creamed French onion soup. The salad was beautifully presented in a cucumber wrap. Unfortunately it was drowned in olive oil and has no flavor. I didn't taste any but oil. The creamed French onion soup had potential but was over powered by salt. The cheesy crouton was salty enough for a less salt ladened soup. My boyfriend had the veggie crepe which was ok. Nothing creative tastebud-wise. The prices are high as is customary along the LV strip. Overall a three star place.",

I believed it was a world-class restaurant; what emerged later into the night was by far the worst experience I ever had at a restaurant!  I've been coming here since 2007 and I've never had an issue until my recent venture. The scenery was almost worth the trip a few flights above the main strip. On the elevator ride, a person could easily experience vertigo if he or she intended to.  The reconfirmation phone call seemed like there was an issue with my reservation; when I called, the women that answered seemed immensely rude! WTH, why treat a customer like that? Our server was fairly courteous and our drinks were adequate. However, he seemed like he was rushing us since we did not order dessert...DESSERT!!! I also got sick after eating here; a first in Vegas for me!   Also, I don't want to get into the explicit details of my abysmal evening. However, I'm hoping the owner will contact me soon.   I don't believe I'll be returning and I can't recommend anyone venturing this place anymore. If you want to pay a lot of money for terrible food and service, then come here...",

    "text": "ery pricey but also very tasty.  This is a top notch French restaurant on the strip, not on the same level as Robuchon, but the level below.  I tried the tasting menu which is a 7 course marathon.  The courses began with some potato leak soup to cleanse the pallet and assortment of bread,  The courses consisted of rabbit, caviar and crab for course 1.  Next was the foie gras, followed by lobster, fish, venison, cheese, and souffle.  Not much hearty meat here as the dishes were specialized and curated for the size and menu.  The highlights were the foie gras which melted in the mouth and the fish which was as good as it gets.  Each sauce was very unique and added a flavor that really complimented each protein.  Many of the sauces were of Asian variety, which was a very unique French offering.  The souffle was superb as well and is not to miss.  Couple the meal with great wine and you got a winner.  To get a window seat you need to make a reservation so plan ahead.  Tables are only for 2 people near the window as an fyi.  Great meal, great atmosphere, great choice.",

I ordered the Chicken with aged Parmesan and it was phenomenal. The sides it came with were cooked in a traditional French style which I loved! The environment is very relaxed and tranquil which is a nice change from the hustle and bustle of the strip. This is an excellent place if you're looking for a fancy meal or a special event. The staff is very welcoming and attentive and make you feel like they're catering to you. You definitely get more than your money's worth.",

I stuck to my plan because a souffle from the Eiffel Tower Restaurant was on my bucket list and I had been waiting a LONG time to try this food!  We had a 7:30 reservation and arrived a little early.  They seated us at 7:30 and as we walked across the restaurant I was a little worried that we were going to the back, but no, we were seated in a great window table for two with a view of the Bellagio Fountains.  The view was awesome.  Good thing because we were there for some time!  This is somewhere you come for a long luxurious meal, if you are in a hurry, you might consider McDonalds.  Our server and busser were friendly and professional, with the busser a little more attentive than the server.  Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and helped me make my decisions.  I was torn between the baked herb crepes, the moroccan chicken and the arctic char and our server suggested the arctic char very highly.  I'm not a huge fan of cooked fish, but I decided to step outside of my comfort zone and I'm glad I did!  My arctic char was cooked rare, which I liked and was served ona bed of roasted beets and some pistachio crumbs.  The only thing that would have made it more delicious would have been if the pistachios were a little heavier.  I barely tasted them.  My husband had the roasted chicken with Moroccan spices and apricots with quinoa pilaf and I tasted that, too and it was DELICIOUS.  I would totally order that - the flavors are fresh and bursting with tangy-ness.    We were happy with the drink selections as they serve Stone beers and they had my favorite champagne, Nicolas Feuillatte Brut.  You can select what type of bread you want from a tray with a small selection of different types of breads carried by the busser.  I had a baguette and then another piece of softer white bread, and he brought big pats of butter.  For dessert, I finally got to have my Chef Joho souffle, but I wasn't prepared for so many choices!  I was tempted to go with pistachio, but I ended up selecting Grand Marnier for my souffle flavor and it was delicious.  The souffle itself was soft and pillowy and the sauce made it sweet and custardy on the inside.  It was heaven and even though I've checked this off my to do list, I have to go back for more.  It's that good.  I am now accepting gift cards if you would like to help a poor girl return to a fancy restaurant.  We actually did pretty good and our meal was only $130 + tip.  I could see how you could spend much, much more, but we left satisfied and happy.",

The steak I had at Wolfgang for $48 apposed to $79 here was far better. They did redeem themselves with solid desserts. I really felt the prices were really outrageous and did not justify the quality. Food 6/10 service 8/10 decor 7.5/10",

Everything is expensive, but very much worth the price. The time spent here is priceless.  If you want to have a dinner to remember and enjoy your eating, this is the right place to go.

I'm a vegetarian and the options were limited, however what I did have was excellent! Mushroom quesadilla was so so good and filling!  My husband had a filet and said it was excellent! Cooked and seasoned perfectly.  I'll post a pic of the seating, we sat window side facing the Bellagio and it was so neat to see the fountains at night, from this perspective. They fountains go ever 20 minutes I believe and at one point we called our children who were placed on no volume and whispered to them what they were about to see. (Didn't want to disrupt anyone's dining experience) Our sons thought it was pretty cool!  The wait staff really takes part in making sure you have an excellent dining experience. It's a great place, great food and I almost didn't go because I thought the restaurant was in the very very top of the tower, it's not! So don't be afraid to go!",

Maybe I'm spoiled by real steakhouse restaurants, but any place charging $64 for a single serve steak should know how to cook it. The first one came back medium well when ordered rare. The waiter tried to convince me the sunlight was somehow giving me vision problems. They promptly did get me another attempt. This time ice cold seared for maybe 10 seconds. They tried one more time and got the temp just about right, but it was still a pretty poor cut for a New York strip.  Mashed potatoes never tasted like bananas last I checked, but the other mushroom side we got was solid. So, go there for the mushrooms and the view and you'll love it.",

We were gonna dine at one of the most fanciest Places in all of Las Vegas, It was me, My dad, Mike and his wife Martha, Joe and his wife Deb (Joe treated everyone to dinner) and Paul and his wife Linda (a table of 8). Located on the 11th Floor of the Paris, we took the Elevator up and when we walked in we saw the Kitchen Staff hard at work preparing Dinner then we saw this big Extraordinary, Elegant Room and you get a nice view overlooking the Bellagio Fountains outside.  We sat down and while making our decisions for Appetizers were treated to a lovely Amuse-Bouche (French for Amusing the Mouth, to wake up your Palate, with a bite-sized appetizer) It was a shot glass filled with Celery Root Mousseline (Mousseline is a creamy soup-like sauce when you fold Whipped cream into Hollandaise) It was topped with some chopped Celery for some Texture (A nice way to start the meal and to wake up the Palate). For my Appetizer I got the New York State Foie Gras which was sitting on a Crispy Alsace Spice Cake with Quince Compote and Petite Mache (Foie Gras, which is what I call meaty butter, melts in your mouth, Quince a tart Fruit, similar to a pear in Appearance but has the Similar taste and texture to an Apple, Spice Cake was a nice crunchy little wafer spiced with cinnamon and Mache a leafy green that has a nutty flavor, it was Awesome).   My Dad got the Lobster Bisque with Lobster Flan, Celery and a Brioche Crouton (Rich, Smooth Creamy Soup with a Flan in the center made from Lobster Stock, you get some crunch from the Celery, and then you take a bite of that Crispy Brioche Crouton, its Spectacular). Everyone else at the Shared 2 Different Salads, The 1st one was a Tuscan Kale Salad, Door County Dried Cherries, Cherry Tomatoes, Quinoa Croutons, Toasted Pecans and finished with a Balsamic Vinaigrette (So much going on in that Salad, Crisp, Earthy Kale, Sweetness from the Cherries, Tartness from the Cherry Tomatoes, you get Crunch from both the Croutons and Pecans and you get Acidity from the Vinaigrette). The 2nd one was a Non-Traditional Caesar Salad with a Dressing made from Anchovies, Capers and Garlic (I honestly don't know what was Non-Traditional about that Salad and I thought the dressing was a tad bit too Salty for my Taste).  For our Drinks, while everyone else was mostly having Red Wine or Chardonnay, Me and Martha partook in one of their Signature Cocktails: The Eiffel Affair (Consisting of Blueberry Vodka, Creme de Cassis, Cointreau, Rose Nectar, some Champagne for that Fizzy and Bubbly Effect and topped off with some Fresh Berries).  For our Entrees: I had The Rabbit with Braised Carrots Confit and Mustard Jus (My first time eating Rabbit, so moist and tender like Chicken, Bite from the Carrots and Sweetness from the Mustard Jus, They use Dijon Mustard). My Dad and Paul had the Pan Seared Pork Chop with Spiced Braised Apples and with a Calvados Sauce (Juicy Pork, the Apples go so well with Pork and the Calvados Sauce was sweet Tasting, Calvados is an Apple Brandy), Mike got the Roasted Rack of Lamb with Tomato Tart and Tarragon Jus (The Bones were Beautifully Frenched ), Martha got the Red Snapper with Razor Clams, Fingerling Potatoes, Tomato Confit and finished with a Shellfish Bouillon (The Fish had a nice Crispy Skin), Deb and Linda had the Roasted Chicken with Apricot, Quinoa Pilaf and Moroccan Spices (I love Roasted Chicken, so flavorful). Joe got the Char Broiled Filet Mignon with a Truffle Sauce (his was the most Expensive).  Then we Ordered Dessert: I got the White Chocolate Banana Elysee (It was named after a Building in France, It was sliced Bananas and White Chocolate Disks stacked on top of each Other surrounded by a Moat of a Chocolate/Vanilla Sauce Mixture and at the top there be a little ball made of Caramelized Sugar, Normally I don't eat bananas but this was so damn Good, it was the most stunning Dessert I've ever eaten, it looked like a spaceship and boy did I take it to my Leader, My Stomach), Mike and Martha got the Chocolate Hazelnut a la Parisienne with Vanilla Ice Cream (It resembled a Bear Claw, Mike and Martha seemed to enjoy, but I thought it was bitter and after 2 Bites I couldn't take anymore), Joe and Deb got the Raspberry Napoleon with a Vanilla Blanc Manger and Red Fruit Sorbet (Stacked Beautifully) and Paul and Linda got the Classic Creme Brulee (A bit of a Cliche).   Everything was Amazing, but I had to delete the Pictures that I took here due to the Flash on my Camera not working so after calling the Restaurant a couple times (10) Linda (one of the Hostesses) and Sharon (one of the General Managers) were kind enough to help me out and to email me the Pictures. Also more thing my dad says you should adjust the lighting cuz it was very dim to him. I really had a nice time here, I'll be sure to come here again the next time I'm in Vegas !!!",

However, I think the menu is a little pricey.  * Sauteed Loup de Mer, Barigoule, Braised Artichoke, Basil Pistou $54 (4 of 5) Tasty sea bass without bones. This was a tasty piece of white fish and I really enjoyed the braised artichoke.   * Sauteed New York State Foie Gras, Slow Braised Pineapple, Alsace Spice Cake $28 (3.5 of 5) I really enjoyed the seared foie gras and braised pineapple, but I didn't think the spice cake complimenting the dish. I didn't think the texture of flavor complimented the dish.   Overall, This place is beautiful and spectacular views, but to be price conscience, I will just go back for drinks and dessert.",

You have to go in through the casino of the hotel and you are led up to the restaurant through an elevator where you are greeted and check in. I made a reservation and requested a fountain view table for our anniversary dinner.   As we waited to be seated were had some drinks by the car which is rather small, but drinks are pretty good. Finally we sat down to our fountain view table. Best view in town!!!! The fountains play every 15 minutes at night time, it's the most beautiful thing ever! We ordered the filet mignon and it's the most delicious filet I've ever had! Everytime I order it here even in the best restaurant in Miami, it's doesn't come even CLOSE to the filet in this restaurant. Cooked to perfection!   The service was impeccable, our waitress was excellent! This restaurant is very \"high end\" so you get the service you're paying for! I plan to go back to Vegas at the end of the year and this will definitely be one of my stops for dinner!!!",

We had requested a window table , when we made the reservation, but when I asked her to change our table to another one that was available , and it was also a 3 top, but by the window like we had requested , the hostess told us in a very mean attitude that we can't have it, and that, that table is promised to someone else through reservation. WE HAD ALSO ASKED FOR A WINDOW TABLE ON OUR RESERVATION!!! HELLO?!! Anyways, the view that we weren't able to enjoy as much was the only good thing about this restaurant. We got a really awful server, who was pushing us to order entrees per person. We ordered bunch of appetizers, and salads , and 1 entree to share. Since we are all tiny girls , we don't eat much, and we like to share everything. The server told us that it was on their menu , that we have to order an entree each. Which was a LIE!! There was no such thing on the menu! We checked afterwards! Then he was like fine I'll make an exception for you!  --- the lamb rack that we ordered was good.  The rest of the food was really mediocre. King crab appetizer wasn't good at all. We all hated it.  Salads were ok! Nothing special.  We ordered desserts with tea, and asked the server to bring them all together.  Our desserts arrived and 15 min later we got our teas! Like why do I even need tea after I'm done with my dessert ?!! Anyways , our server was really slow, and didn't care about anything but his pocket!  We spent over $300 for this bullshit!!!  He was gonna get enough tip off of us anyways, why push to get more stuff and leave a bad taste in mouthes! We were ordering so many drinks Already , food , dessert , and teas anyways! What a greedy server! The manager should really be careful who he is hiring! Because we are not coming back after this awful experience with the server and MEAN HOSTESS!",

We were a party of 6 and our food took an hour to arrive. In the interim we just sat and waited...the waiter did not check in and we had to ask for our water to be refilled. The food was really overpriced. I don't mind paying for great food but $60 for bland Muscovy duck and $70 for really undercooked lamb was just disappointing.  We all thought it's typical Vegas prices but we went to the Foundation Room for dinner the next night and it was a complete pleasure.",

(Our servers name was Ron) He asked us if we wanted drinks & we asked to see the specialty drink menu. We asked for a few minutes to look at the menu & he came back to our table every 30 seconds to see if we had made any decisions. My husband and I both ordered cocktails without having a chance to look anything over. When they arrived, they were nothing either of us cared for. At $19 a drink, it's unfortunate we didn't get to enjoy them.   Any time we tired to take a video or picture of the view or Bellagio Fountains Show our server would interrupt. We asked to be seated at the window so we could enjoy the view & enjoy time together.   Ordering dinner we were treated with the similar impatience as the drink order. He gave us a lot of information and the dinner specials & no time to process the large menu. He also gave us the desert menu at the same time & said souffles need to be ordered with dinner. So we had two menus we needed to process, and again he came back every 30 seconds checking for orders. It was overwhelming.   The food was wonderful. I actually feel terrible giving the review two stars because the food was so great. I ordered the Sea Bass & my husband ordered the 22oz bone in Ribeye-which came with a huge bone on top with bone marrow. It was incredible & if you're a steak lover, we definitely recommend it.   Over all, we loved this place.  I wish our server was nicer, and more patient for new comers. We could have left with a much better experience.",

We had late lunch here and it wasn't crowded at all. Luckily, we had the window seat facing the Bellagio and were able to appreciate the fountain show of Bellagio every 30 mins. The food is also very well cooked and fresh - I opted the tasting menu that comes with appetizer (warm shrimp, well seasoned and crispy!), entree (flat iron steak, perfectly cooked, super juicy and tender), and a dessert( strawberry frozen souffle, very interesting texture, tasted almost like ice cream at first). Wine pairing for the meal complements the dishes very well! I also had a bite of my husband's lobster Benedict - good portion of lobster! In summary, a great place to have lunch or dinner with the view! The staff is also warm and attentive to our needs.",

We arrived at 8:00 for our reservation and were promptly taken up the elevator and seated at....ta da! a window table overlooking the fountains! Score!  Guys-the service is the real star here. I swear we felt like we were the only table our server was waiting on. He was constantly there to fill our drinks, answer our questions, take our picture (cut me some slack-it was our anniversary!). It was like every time we turned around he was there. And not in an annoying way-just helpful.  The food was great. Not spectacular, but really good. We shared a \"non-traditional\" Caesar salad and it didn't disappoint. The bread and butter (oh my freaking hell that butter was heavenly) were so delicious that it was hard not to have too much and thereby ruin our entrees. For the main course I chose the beef Wellington and my sweetheart went with the chicken supreme. As much as I hate to say it (and it hurt my bank account as well), I'm quite certain that I make a better beef Wellington at home. The beef, while perfectly cooked (medium rare, is there any other way to cook beef?) and incredibly tender, was kind of tasteless. The snap pea accompaniment, however, was delectable. My husband enjoyed his chicken-it was seasoned wonderfully and although it seemed like a small portion, it filled him up well. We chose the potato gratin and creamed spinach for our shared side dishes. The potatoes were wonderful-cheesy and creamy and full of flavor. The creamed spinach was way off. It was unnecessarily greasy and lacked the creamy texture we were hoping for.  Pass on that for sure.  We splurged and ordered the Nutella banana souffle. It was delightful. Light yet rich and scrumptious. It's not to be missed. The restaurant was gracious enough to also provide us a complimentary dessert with a sweet Happy Anniversary message written on the plate in chocolate. It was thoughtful and appreciated.  The Eiffel Tower Restaurant might just be one of those once in a lifetime things. It's expensive. Like super pricey. And I get it-the service is impeccable. The food isn't the best I've ever had but it was certainly not something I'd turn my nose up at! The views are amazing-even if you're not fortunate enough to get a window seat, the entire place has floor to ceiling windows so you'll get a good view almost anywhere.  Go for a special occasion-you won't regret it. Just bring lots of money and a hearty appetite!",

Wanted a table by the window for 3 but unfortunately there were no tables left around the perimeter for viewing purposes so we were seated as close as they possibly could. Tables for more than 2 were SOL. Should've made a reservation.  It's romantic if you want it to be but upon closer observation, the interior looks a tad bit outdated. The waitstaff is very professional and courteous. We ordered the salmon, the flat iron steak and the eggs Benedict. Overall, the food was good. My salmon had a mustard seed crust - seemed to be a bit too overwhelming with the season but flavorful and there was a bone in the first bite I had. Others commented they enjoyed their meals.  Meal and service was good. Def make a reservation for best seating.",

The food is something was so amazing that I feel like everything else I have eaten afterwards merely pales in comparison. Thank you Lyle for your team and the atmosphere you create.

Even from the bar you have a surrounding view looking at the strip.   The best part, by far, was the steak tartare appetizer. It was one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth. Cooked and seasoned to perfection. I'm drooling just thinking about it.  For my entree, I had the seabass. Also cooked to perfection, and the encrusting was amazing.

This is one of the heavyweight contenders for very fine dining on the Las Vegas Strip and it more than holds it's own against the likes of L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon.  In fact, flavor-wise it exceeds L'Atelier (but Robuchon excels in presentation, exclusivity and service experience).  When you enter, you'll find the elevator entrance in the base of the tower in the casino.  Once your reservation is double checked (and you'll want to reserve months in advance if you can), you are ushered onto the elevator which lifts you up to the restaurant where the doors open to a busy kitchen and a host waiting to seat you.  Book your reservation early enough and you'll be treated to an amazing view of The Strip and the Bellagio fountain display in a romantically dark and lushly appointed restaurant.  A sommelier was there to help us as soon as we sat down.  With a bottle of Heidsieck Monopole we settled in to watch the view...but once the first plate from the tasting menu appeared the scenery and environment was merely a backdrop to the cooking artistry.    The plates were beautiful and absorb your attention on all levels;  sight, smell and taste.  The rich foie gras was perfectly accented with the pain perdu and rhubarb compote.  The halibut and veal dishes were amazing, perfectly cooked and accented with both vegetables and sauces.  The souffle was expertly executed.   The service from the sommelier and Ivan, our server, was attentive, non-intrusive and worthy of the caliber of restaurant this is.   Plan to drop $500 for two people if you want to really get down and enjoy the menu.  But you can get by with less by sitting at the bar and selecting and sharing a couple of menu items.  Worth it?  Yup.  Or perhaps I should say, \"Le yups\".",

I came as a girl's night out the other night, and we were very impressed overall with the whole experience and the meal. The Supervisor Lyle went out of his way to make our evening 5 stars.     The night started with a complimentary chilled soup from the chef which was really nice an unexpected. My friends ordered the An Eiffel Affair and the Raspberry Mule cocktails and seemed to really enjoy them. I ordered the Casco Bay Sea Scallops, which came out with 2 medium cooked scallops. I prefer my scallops with more of a sear on them, but still a nice dish. We also ordered the Steak Tartare, which was really special and unique in both the flavorful tartare, and the bread-like chips.   The Rack of Lamb was so delicious, and was perfectly cooked medium rare. I also got the Rossini Style Filet Mignon with Foie Gras, and this was equally delicious. The Filet Mignon actually came with a quite generous portion which was a nice surprise since I was expecting a smaller cut of meat. The Foie Gras was very tasty, and this dish was great because it's like an appetizer and a main course in one. I would give both these dishes 5 stars.   Lastly, for dessert I got the chocolate souffle (which you have to order at the beginning of the meal). I was impressed with the 7+ different souffles they offered, but we decided to stick with the classic. It was exactly how a souffle should be- light at the top and gooey at the bottom. They ended the meal with complimentary chocolates.   Prepare to pay some $$$ for this meal, but it is so worth it if you want to have a special dinner. The entirety of the restaurant offers a beautiful view of the strip, so this is a great place to come if you are a tourist.",

I make a reservation in advance which is kind of a must (especially for a holiday) we got there early because I was trying hard for a window seat ( right in front of the fountains). We had to wait a little while so we sat at the bar and ordered some pricey drinks. The bartender was cool and had a great accent.    We were seated and the table was pretty good. It wasnt the exact view I hoped for but it could of been much worse. We weren't overly impressed with the pricey food which is always a bummer when your spending a lot of dough you want it to taste amazing. I tried escargot here for the first time and don't really think I need to try it again. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy some very higher class dishes but this one isn't for me. The flavor in our steaks was lacking as well as the buttery melt in your mouth texture.  I would come here strictly for the views.",

    "text": "Long situated as a focal point inside Paris Las Vegas Hotel & Casino it was finally on Saturday that the elevator was ascended to Eiffel Tower Restaurant, Chef Jean Joho's classic French Cuisine put on display several stories above The Strip in a space offering privileged views of Sin City and particularly of the Bellagio Fountains.   Open since 1999 and managed by Lettuce Entertain You, the same group behind Paris' Mon Ami Gabi plus Joho's Michelin starred Everest in Chicago, it is after ascending 110 feet into the 50-story Tower that doors open onto a showpiece kitchen, a staff of at least fifteen hard at work for Dinner beginning daily at 4:30pm plus Lunch on Weekdays and Brunch on Weekends.  No doubt a tourist hotspot, the elevated vantage and central location virtually guaranteeing traffic despite prices a bit higher than some might expect, it is after checking in at the hostess podium that guests are led to seats lining windows or on a higher ledge also offering a good view, though earlier arrival or reservations are recommended for prime real estate.  Featuring a full-bar plus an impressive cellar, the Wines mostly French and predictably subject to substantial mark-up, it is with Water poured that daytime guests are left to peruse items ranging light to rich, signatures designated by a small icon while five Brunch specials and a three-course tasting menu are also highlighted.  Well-priced considering the setting, service staff in suits and piano playing overhead adding class to crisp linens and dark red carpets, it was declining the $39 tasting that three courses were instead ordered along with Iced Tea, an amuse of Parsnip Cream a nice touch with contrasting Sage while housemade Baguette also showed well despite nearly-frozen Butter that initially proved impossible to spread.  Toqued by Executive Chefs Joung Sohn and Lucas Knox who have recently made small adjustments to the menu, a \"luxury\" French Toast topped in Foie Gras lost in the shuffle, it was nonetheless that dining was underway with one of two current Duck Liver preparations, the warm version selected over a cold Terrine and proving nicely seared atop buttery Brioche and stewed Apples complimented by Cabernet Jus.  Turning next to one of Chef Joho's classics, a $22 plate of what many might call \"fried Chicken,\" suffice it to say that there is nothing simple about the thinly pounded Breast coated in Bread Crumbs and aged Cheese, the salinity nicely balanced by a sidecar of Brown Butter that also adds plenty of flavor to crispy Potatoes and snappy Green Beans.  Switching from Tea to Coffee going forward, both freshly brewed and refilled consistently, those seeking French Toast may want to dine somewhere else, a cost of $19 excessive even if the single piece were prepared perfectly - which it most certainly was not as the center was 1/6 filled with Custard thus leaving the rest dry and thirsty for Syrup.  Not wanting to exit disappointed, though the staff's failure to inform guests in advance of Apple Strudel that takes twenty minutes to prepare was also unfortunate, it was with an $8.50 Frozen \"Souffle\" that Brunch concluded, the layers of Strawberry and Grand Marnier Semifreddo juxtaposed to Fruit and Nuts while three tiny Mignardises including one made of Passion Fruit were a pleasant send-off.  ***1/2:  In a city where several Restaurants come with a view Eiffel Tower Restaurant fares particularly well thanks to the Bellagio Fountains, but taking into account premium pricing small details like rock-hard Butter and poorly executed French Toast are difficult to ignore no matter how good Jean Joho's Modern French Cuisine is otherwise.",

    "text": "My friends and I have been coming to Vegas for many years now and have tried many upscale fine dining restaurants, but this was the first time we'd tried French Food here.....and by the end of the meal, we were all in agreement that this was perhaps the best meal we have ever had in all our years of visiting Vegas. Ambiance was upscale, elegant, and classy, views of the strip were awesome, service was excellent....but most notable were the wonderfully delicious dishes we had ordered....and with a nice bottle of wine to go with it all. Yes, this place is not cheap, but you definitely get what you pay for.  Everything was so fresh, perfectly cooked, flavorful, and artfully presented. For our dinner, we didn't want to fill up too much before a show we were attending, so we ordered a Market Greens salad which came with Avocado, Sunflower Seeds, Sherry Walnut Vinaigrette. For Entrees, my friends ordered the Individual Eiffel Tower Beef Wellington and Rossini Style Filet Mignon with Foix Gras and Truffle Sauce. I went with the Boneless Chicken Breast with Fingerling Potatoes Jus de Poulet.  The market salad was so fresh, so beautifully presented......really enjoyed the Avocado and Sherry Walnut Vinaigrette. As for the mains, my friends were so impressed that the first comments from their mouths were  \"mmmmm....So melt-in-your-mouth Good!\" I was equally impressed by my chicken and particularly enjoyed the sauce that came with it.....yummy!   Service was excellent throughout as we were so well taken care of by our server David. Oh, and we were so glad he mentioned at the very beginning that if we wanted to order the Souffle dessert that we should do it by the time our food came out as it takes 30 minutes to make......we did exactly that and went ahead and ordered the Grand Marnier Souffle. Oh boy! I have tried truly outstanding souffles before, but this beats them all, hands down! Even my friends who are more of dessert people than I said this was the best they have ever eaten!  Overall a wonderful experience from start to finish. Our only regret is that we came a bit early when it was still light outside. If it were dark, the views of the city lights and Bellagio fountains would have just completed a perfect dining experience.....which was finished off with little desserts at the end of the meal....which I believe I heard them referred to as \"Petit Fours\" .....? Whatever they were called......very nice touch to end a wonderful meal!  As one would expect, the ET is not cheap.....even the wines run from just under a hundred to thousands!.....so be sure to reload your credit cards!",

Stunning night-time view of the water show across the street at the Belaggio.  Beef Wellington - 1/5. A $68 entree I would have regretted ordering at $20. Totally unremarkable. Muscovy Duck - 2/5. A $49 entree I would have given 3/5 at $30. Flavorful blood orange sauce, but a tad dry. Again, regrets. Apple Side Car - 4/5. An excellent cocktail, but again, $19? White Chocolate Peppermint Souffle (Seasonal) - 5/5. At $8, this little puppy saved the meal from total disaster. A must-try if you dine here during the holiday season.  Grand Marnier Souffle - 2/5. The same price as the white chocolate peppermint souffle, but altogether not as good. Didn't even want to finish it.  If you're willing to pay through the nose for an inconsistent menu, supported by a well-appointed interior, a gorgeous view and excellent customer service, this is the place. Some people enjoy the dining experience more than the food. If you fall into that category, the Eiffel Tower may be for you. If you're just looking to eat well, you can do better than this. If you're looking for bang for the buck, skip it.",

We were greeted, and immediately taken to our table with a view of the Bellagio fountains. The service was amazing, and we were very well taken care of.  We tried so many wonderful things, and all were delicious. The main courses: rack of lamb, and beef Wellington were the favorites. We ordered sides, but the main course were delicious and the sides were not needed.  It is pricey, but please keep in mind you are not just eating, you are part of a dining experience. Ride it, and enjoy. My goodness, what a wonderful experience to dine at the Effiel Tower restaurant. I hope to do it again soon.",

    "text": "The Eiffel Tower restaurant at the Paris is a gem that is hidden in plain sight. First off, the obvious: the restaurant is perched 14 floors above the Las Vegas Strip overlooking the Bellagio, partway up on the half-height Eiffel tower, and the views are spectacular from every table in the place. Couples' tables are available on the windows, but are very hard to get.  Some may have the initial impression that this place is cheesy. Do not fall into that misimpression. The service is excellent. We had the five-course tasting menu for $145, which also brings amuse bouche to start and petit fours to finish.  We also elected the $89 wine pairing, and it was totally worth it.  The courses included two seafood courses, which were excellent and creatively prepared, buttery and succulent foie gras, and a delicious and exceedingly well-prepared veal as the final savory course. We opted for the souffle for dessert and we were not disappointed.  If you wish to have the souffles, order them when you place your initial food order. As high-end dining in Las Vegas goes, there are far higher-end options, but those are dizzyingly expensive.  For a high-quality, multicourse French meal with excellent service, the Eiffel Tower restaurant provides an excellent value and is far more affordable than many of the other options.  This is truly a unique experience, to enjoy a well-prepared meal of this caliber overlooking the Las Vegas strip from a vantage point that you do not normally enjoy (think: watch the Bellagio Fountains show from above...).  This is also a very romantic restaurant, so it is perfect for anniversaries, birthdays, proposals, or just any time you want to take your special person out for a special meal.",

We were contacted asking if we could come sooner to get a window table and were delighted. We rearranged our plans to make it work.  We arrived early and upon being seated noticed no desserts in the main menu and advised our waiter we only needed a dessert and drink menus. At this point the maitre d came over to inform us we could only have a table of we were each purchasing an entree.  Nowhere on open table does it state this, which we explained, but we were given an unconvincing perfunctory apology and asked again if we would like entrees.  I'm easy going....you can have whatever rules you want.....but you need to make sure they are explained when you allow sites to set reservations.  Also, I counted 9 tables 4 window and 5 non window) THAT WERE EMPTY!!!  You really embarrassed us and lost out on what would have been a quick table turnover to keep an extra empty table?  Unbelievable.",

    "text": "I would give 5 stars for their chocolate souffle, their awesome window view overlooking towards the Bellagio fountains, and their meal service but somethings I had to consider were:  1)  When I make a birthday reservation for 7:30 p.m., I expect the reservation for 7:30 p.m., not 8:15 p.m. 2)  If I want an order of Hennessey, I'd rather get a bottle at Eddie's Liquor for $30 instead of 30mL for $24 (if you're planning on drinking a cocktail, stick to their bar during your wait or get a head start down at the casino or get hammered in your hotel before you arrive~ it'll be way more cheaper in the end!) 3)  I'm not an expert on French cuisine, but I expect good tasting food no matter what country of origin. The sea bass was okay with a nice crisp on the skin but expected more flavor and a thicker cut ( I had better at a small hole in the wall in San Clemente, CA); the asparagus was too al dente and drenched in way too much butter for my liking (and I love butter); the mushroom side was sad and I haven't had a mushroom dish I never liked until now.  That being said, I did appreciate our attentive server and the experience of fine dining. My date's rack of lamb and creme brulee was wonderful but nothing could beat their chocolate souffle.....I almost had a relationship with it!  All in all, expect to pay for the experience, the view, and the souffle.",

Everything was cooked well, tasted great, but no imagination and as I've read in other reviews it is in fact fairly pedestrian. I'd give the food a 2.5-3 stars. For the prices, the food is entirely average.   Experience: That said you go to this restaurant because of the amazing views of the Las Vegas strip. It is truly out of this world. You have a full view of all the lights of Vegas and  directly overlook the Bellagio fountain show which is quite frankly incredible!!  The service was good/great and the drinks were delicious. The price tag is high but in my opinion that's to be expected in Vegas especially with a view like this... It's the best view in Vegas which makes up for the caliber of food.  I will go back.

    "text": "Woohoo! As good as it gets!  To this establishment, first and foremost: thank you.  I had a special occasion that I wished to more than just celebrate -- I wanted to honor it.  Through every aspect within their power, their execution was flawless.  It all started with communicating my intentions to one of the managers, whose information I took from prior review responses.  I figured if someone cared enough to write back to people, they might be the right sort to handle my requests with care.  I couldn't have been more right.  Laurent Ertle is the man I owe the uncanny success of the following.  Through him, his suggestions, and his staff, when the night came, everything flowed effortlessly.  We pre-arranged the time and table to have, in my opinion, the best seats in the house.  The view and progression of the evening was marvelous.  A prepayment plan was set in place to avoid that awkward distraction at the end of the evening.  I was even granted the appropriate menus and floral piece for the table.  After the warm welcome to our seats, the evening began with a cocktail.  Expressing an interest in St. Germain, our server when to ask the bar on specialties.  What returned was their version of a French 75.  A delightfully fragrant, subtly sweet, and slightly strong drink -- the perfect definition of a cocktail.  Shortly thereafter, we were given a choice of bread to have.  While normally I would have picked a different bread to try each time around, I just couldn't get past having more of the wonderful french baguette -- rightfully so, considering the venue.  Then we were given a sample of gazpacho.  It was creamy and smooth being watery in neither flavor nor texture.  Thus it was obvious to me that the selection of vegetables, spices, and method was very deliberate.  To follow was an amuse bouche.  I had to ask the waiter twice what the trio was, and I still unfortunately forgot what they were exactly.  So instead of exact, I'll be broad: one was a fluffy, rich cheese-pastry; second was an oyster topped with caviar on a bed of black pepper and sea-salt; third was a mini quiche looking bite.  It succeeded in spurring my appetite for more.  For appetizers we ordered a corn soup and roasted foie gras.  The soup was the result of for some inexplicable reason that they don't serve french onion soup, which I would have considered a given.  Simple and tasty the soup was with a good marrying of ripe corn and hints of bacon.  The foie gras was luxuriously rich, and smartly paired with grapes and crisps for palate contrast and cleansing.  Our main courses were the Aged New York Steak and Bone Marrow in a Cabernet Reduction as well as a Beef Wellington with Snap Peas.  I will say that my definition of medium-rare must differ from the kitchen's, but it's typically against my principles to argue with a chef's execution unless gross malpractice has occurred.  After just one bite, I forgot about any disagreement I might have had.  I was reminded that the quality of cut and preparation is at least as important as the method.  The marrow and reduction added a level of depth new to me with such a course.  The complex flavors still make me salivate at the mere memory of them.  The wellington was flawless in every way -- from presentation to indulgence.  The pastry shell advertised the culinary art contained.  It was flaky and refined.  Inside was a wonderfully tender, and expertly cooked, cut of beef.  More-so this course, I very easily would recommend it to anyone.  Desert was a pair of souffles, that have to be ordered at the very beginning due to their complexity.  We had a gran marnier and pistachio.  Both light and delicious, which was the point of getting two.  I have to say I preferred the pistachio, but that is far from an easy decision to make -- I had to compare one to the other exhaustively.  The petit fours were simple treats of milk chocolate, fudge, white chocolate, or mango.  They definitely were unimpressive, but that's what happens when everything else was so far above standard.  I had asked the photographer to return so that our photo would take place with the night lights of the Bellagio Fountains.  Not only did she, but she was enough of a perfectionist to wait for the exact right moment of the fountain show to snap the moment.  She also had our finished photo to us in what seemed like no time at all.  A special note must be given to the server, Mario.  Not to be confused with the waiter (which for the first time for me, was not the same person).  He was an absolute pleasure to have around.  He was not only prompt and courteous in profession, but also charming and humorous in conversation.  It was the type of thing that beside all the foreign luxury we were surrounded in, there still was a sense of reality to ground the experience in memory instead of fantasy.  I was denied the tower ride due to mother nature, but hopefully that will also encourage me to return again to at least shake Laurent Ertle's hand.",

It felt awkward to take pictures inside the restaurant, but my family had no problem flashing away at everything.  Now the food and cocktails. Cocktails were upwards of $16. We had the Pimm's Cup, Red Velvet, and Sparkling Passion. All of them were extremely good and perfectly mixed. We ordered the warm foie gras to start. It's so tiny the four slices of pear that accompany it was a bigger portion. But it was smooth and melt in your mouth. Definitely not worth the price. Next to come out was the veal medallions. This is a must get; it was delicious. We had it come out with the appetizers.  Now for the entrees: They ran out of black cod, by the time we got there, so we got the sea bass. It was good, a might order again. The cured duck breast was not that great. I like fatty Chinese roasted duck much better, a definite will not order again. Rack of lamb was perfect; cooked to perfection and tasted so tender, will order again. We had two New York steaks, both ordered medium rare, but one came out a little drier. It is also a will order again. I regret not ordering a surf and turf instead of the second NY steak.  To finish off, we had ordered two souffles when told they need to be ordered in advanced. Not sure if we ate too quickly, but we waited a good fifteen minutes between the entrees and dessert. But then they came, one chocolate souffle, and the other waiter-recommended grand marnier souffle. Both were great, but definitely the grand marnier souffle was the best, will come just for this!  In all, the food was great. Not sure I would come back because it didn't seem like the food was worth the price. Next time, I'll just stick at the bar for the view.",

I ordered the Parmesan chicken. It tasted fine.. Like chicken, but a chicken that was pounded out so thin and tasted jerky-ish. The green beans with it were seasoned with something very strong. I couldn't quite pin point the taste, but I wish they would tell you when they're going to use a powerful seasoning. So I didn't eat them. The stack of au gratin potatoes just sucked and they were cold and not seasoned well. My boyfriend asked for meat and cheese only on his burger and they gave him a burger with an entire side salad on that bitch and it was WAY burnt on one side.  We didn't dare tell our waiter our problems because he had his nose so far up in the air. He scoffed at me when I asked a valid question about the menu and rolled his eyes at almost everything we said. It also took him forever to bring our check when we were obviously finished eating and sitting there staring at him as he's unfolding tablecloths and setting out napkins for the  dinner service. So awkward and really annoying. We also came around 2 on a Thursday so the fountains weren't even going off. This meal was a complete bummer. 2 stars only for the drink and the view and the bartender who broke our 20 for us.  Those passion fruit jelly things are terrible. Thanks, but no thanks.",

We arrived a little early for our reservation but the hostess stated our table was ready.  The wait staff was friendly and each member was attentive from the choice of breads to refilling water glasses to following up on the satisfaction of our meal. The pace was unhurried and just right.   The Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon was cooked to perfection and delicious. We shared the potato Anna, crispy sliced buttery potatos and the green beans almondine that was fresh and al dente. Both side dishes are ample in size and perfect for sharing. The Wild Snapper Filet had a crispy skin with a moist and tender inside. The fish was served on a bed of Belgium Endive along side Confit Orange with a Bordelaise sauce. This entree was just supurb.   We were offered 3 complementry desserts. First a small chocolate mousse topped with whip cream and a slice of chocolate served on a plate with \"Happy Anniversary\" piped in chocolate around the rim. Very smooth. The second dessert was an artist pallid with 6 different sorbets and in the center a large strawberry incased in hardened sugar. This dessert was over the top. Third we were then presented with and able to choose from an assortment of petit fours. So glad we did not order dessert off the menu. The entire restaurant staff contributed to making this a very special experience. With the night time view of Las Vegas Blvd.10 stories below it was like going to the theater.    We have been big fans of Lettuce Entertain You restaurants from their beginning with R.J. Grunts in Chicago over 40 years ago. Thanks Rich Melman, keep the great restaurants coming.",

We had the half avocado with crab and shrimp for me and the bacon club BLT sandwich as well.  This place is an oasis in a hot and busy city.",

    "text": "Fantastic dinner and service at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant!  We came for our 28th Anniversary, and the entire evening was perfect.  We had no issues with the Open Table reservation, and were sat right away for our 7:30 time.  Our server, Kostya, was very attentive and timely throughout the meal, provided excellent suggestions and wine choices. Meal was prepared and served to perfection.  Highlight of the meal was the rack of lamb, which was prepared to the correct temperature while maintaining the tenderness of the lamb.  The restaurant is small and tables close together, especially against the windows.  A few hints for an enjoyable evening, make your reservations ahead of time, and request a window seat, keep in mind window seats are typically 2 person tables, and larger parties will sit away from the direct window.  Ask questions of the server, ours was very knowledgeable about the menu and wine list, and made wonderful suggestions.  And lastly the Eiffel Tower restaurant is pricey, so plan on it, but going in with this knowledge will make a very enjoyable evening.",

    "text": "The Skinny: come here for the view - not for the food (2.5)service: solid but not high end restaurant level (3) value: overpriced for the cuisine but a great view of the Bellagio fountains (2.5 starred review bump up to 3 stars).  We came for the brunch menu last weekend after receiving our annual coupons from Lettuce Entertain You.  We went in to try their brunch prix fixe and also to try a few a la carte items.  After making an Open Table reservation, we choose the earliest seating at 11 am. Despite arriving at the hostess area at 11 am, we were asked to sit in a small area for a while as they set up our table. They seated us with a nice view of the Bellagio fountains.  Overall the cuisine sounds very elegant but in reality, it's just subpar French bistro cuisine with better plating. I get to that again in a moment.  We chose the brunch prix fixe menu - the mushroom strudel appetizer, the steak and eggs, and the \"frozen\" strawberry souffle for $39. We chose the foie gras tourchon appy and the curry chicken pie entree as well.  We were treated to two slice of baguette with some butter to start. The bread was warm but other than that, nothing special. Really, it's the same thing that likely gets served at Mon Ami Gabi. This is in stark contrast to when they used to serve warm cheese gourgeres.  Amuse was a zucchini parfait. The zucchini parfait itself was good however it unfortunately was served with these odd pastry sticks which were hard yet not crispy, chewy and flavorless. It really detracted from the zucchini parfait itself. A bad plating decision that pops up again and again throughout the meal.  The mushroom strudel was kind of strange. Made of filo pastry, it's mostly made out of spinach rather than mushrooms. The spinach was surprisingly bland and you couldn't really taste the mushrooms due to the lack there of.  At least the parmesean cheese sprinkled above and below the filo pastry crust imparted a bit of umami to the dish but otherwise I can't recommend ordering this dish.  The foie gras tourchon was a disappointment - it wasn't nearly as luscious as I expected. Served with some brioche toast, the fig compote had a odd kind of fermented flavor to it as well as being too thick to be spread easily. Decidedly meh and I wouldn't recommend it.  From the starters to the entrees, there was a good 30 minute wait between. Luckily the view was nice so we didn't mind as much but there is obvious a timing issues in the kitchen.  Steak and eggs were ordered medium rare and came out medium-well. I'm not one to send stuff back usually. Plus given the long wait between the dishes, I just went with the flow. The quality of the steak was good and the meat was tender. The potatoes and red pepper hash underneath was delicious. Unfortunately the blanched spinach was unseasoned and therefore completely bland which diluted the flavors of the dish. It was okay, but once was enough.  Chicken curry pot pie was essentially a version of chicken tikka masala baked under a puff pastry crust. The filling was underwhelming and slightly overly acidic. It really needed something to mellow the flavor out a bit. It was also missing a bit of that smokiness from real chicken tikka. It definitely need some dried fenugreek leaves to give it a more authentic flavor. I don't think I would recommend ordering this.  We split their \"frozen\" strawberry souffle. I kind of had a beef with that. Call a spade a spade - it's just ice cream molded into a ramekin to look like souffle. Word.  Anyway, the ramekin ice cream block with sprinkled pistachio was alright. In my honest opinion, I got more enjoyment from a grocery store purchased ice cream than this stuff.  The strawberry ice cream was overly firm and had a weird Cool Whip consistency when melted slightly. This contrasted to the more icy texture of the Grand Marnier ice cream on the bottom. This was a grade D in the level of desserts. It was okay because it was a part of the prix fixe but I would have been down right pissed if I'd ordered a la carte. Save your pennies and head over to a half decent gelati joint and be way more happy.  At the end you get some chocolates (tastes like Cadbury chocolates and certainly nothing really special) and some fruit flavored jellies.  Service, in general is good. Water glasses were filled through out the meal and food was served promptly and at the proper temperatures. Our waiter was courteous and helpful. However it was missing the small attention to detail that differentiates a truly high end restaurant (such as - describing your dishes in detail, removing the wine glasses as soon as they know you're not going to order wine... stuff like that).  This joint exemplifies the rule for \"view\" restaurants: the quality of the food is inversely proportional to the view. Added the price premium for the location, I would not recommend this place as a top choice for a romantic dinner for 2. 2.5 starred review with a bump up to a 3 starred review.",

Souffle is amazing and  good but a tad to sweet but it was still delicious. Overall it was a pleasant experience. Great food and nice view of the Vegas strip !",

But when it comes to entertaining out of town Japanese guests, this place was a very good choice. I'm gonna keep this one short and simple. We got very good service and food. I do understand that prices will be high for this sort of thing but the quality was there. Servers were very attentive and were very patient in explaining everything on the menu as well as offering fine suggestions with wine pairings.  The view.... this is why you come to this restaurant over others. The view of the strip was spectacular. Overlooking Bellagio, you can view the fountain shows (Minus the audio) while enjoying your meal. For couples, they have you facing outward as well for a nice extra touch. You have to kind of get lucky to get this view seating however. Even if you make a reservation, when you show up, you can be seated right away to an available table, or you'll be asked to wait if you want a view table. We waited about 45 minutes for a view table which at first irritated me, but afterwards, I'm so glad we did.  If you're a tourist, or a local that is entertaining tourists, then this is a good place to make a good impression.",

    "text": "Eiffel Tower is a delightful restaurant. You arrive via elevator, up through the \"Eiffel Tower\" structure in the middle of the Paris casino complex. The elevator opens directly into the kitchen pass, which is a unique and rather cool touch I've never seen before. Once you enter the dining room, a dim room with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the strip; you're greeted warmly. This is one of the few high-end restaurants I've visited where even a family with a small baby (admittedly a quiet, well-dressed baby) was welcomed by the hostesses.   Our family had made a reservation several months ago, and had specifically asked for a table near the windows. We were given a delightful 3-top with a perfect view of the Bellagio fountains. Our service team was quiet and well-trained, although they did not quite meet the same level of service that one experiences at Twist. (No holding of chairs for ladies, etc.) My spouse suggested that I might be nit-picking when I complained that they only utilized their crumb scrapers at the end of our meal, rather than after each course.   The food itself was classical and elegant. We started our meal with a cauliflower creme, sent out by the chef as an amuse bouche. Rich, \"roasty\" and delicious. My son ordered the filet mignon, which was perfectly prepared and delicious. My entree was black cod served on a bed of cauliflower couscous. The fish fell apart when I touched it with my fork- it was tender, moist and very well done. Easily the best non-salmon fish entree I've ever had. My spouse ordered the Wellington, which he was not thrilled with. It was prepared well and he had no specific critique...it just didn't suit him. For sides, we shared the brown butter spaetzl and the green beans. The former was delicious (if a bit on the oily side) while the latter were...just green beans. I'd suggest you be more adventurous if you dine here.   For dessert, we ordered chocolate cake and apple strudel. My spouse loved the apple dish. I found the chocolate cake to be too rich to finish; which is saying something, considering that I am a die-hard chocoholic and the portion was small. The management also sent over a lovely artists palate of assorted sorbet, with a side of berries. They explained that this was an apology for a drunken diner seated nearby that had to be asked to leave. Considering that we had not even noticed an incident occurring in this very quiet dining room, I think this speaks volumes to the staffs discretion when handing front of the house issues. Honestly? The sorbet (Raspberry, Mango, Green Apple, Creme, and Chocolate) were my favorite desserts. I would order that again in a heartbeat.   In short? Paris is now my second favorite Las Vegas restaurant (running behind Twist) and is recommended, should you find yourself in that part of the country.",

I tend to judge restaurants immediately by the type of bottled water they serve.  Acqua Panna is almost always a good sign.   Every thing I've eaten here has been exquisite, but I've been less then thrilled with their quite expensive signature drinks...now we stick to their reds by the glass.  Tip:  Eiffel Tower Restaurant is usually one of the more affordable spots to watch New Years and July 4th fireworks.  You can eat a prix fixe menu, or just eat/drink at the bar and pay the special event cover (I think it was $50 last year).  There is bar seating that faces directly out onto the strip, with a stunning view of the bellagio fountains.  Even at the main bar...lovely views.  And if you are ballin like that, and have dinner, there is hardly a bad seat in the house.  Enjoy!",

We were seated by the windows overlooking the Bellagio Fountains.  This is such a great view.  If this view is offered, don't hesitate, you won't regret it! I ordered the escargot for my appetizer (delicious but I have had better elsewhere), and the lamb chops for my entree.  The lamb chops were cooked medium and literally melted in my mouth.  Awesome flavor and very well cooked.  My husband ordered the NY strip steak and he loved his steak also.  For dessert we were presented with a chocolate dessert from the chef with a happy anniversary message written on the plate.  It was a very nice gesture! We also ordered the grand marnier souffle, which was just plain good.   Overall:  The restaurant was a bit pricey, but we knew we were going to spend quite a bit of cash when it came to our anniversary dinner.  This was not a problem.  And in my opinion, with the beautiful view, delicious food and impeccable service, we decided it was money well spent.",

    "text": "The best part about this restaurant is the ambiance and the view of the Bellagio Fountains. Luckily we were able to get a seat by the window with an amazing view and I was mesmerized by the fountains. Being my first time in Las Vegas I am glad I went, but next time I am in Vegas I doubt I will go to ETR. Not saying I won't go back ever, just wasn't as blown away by the food as I was expecting. I have mixed feelings about the staff. They were polite and attentive, but there were times I felt they were a bit snobby and not accommodating. The host at the front of the house annoyed me at the beginning - we were about 5 minutes late for our reservation, our fault I realize, but they made us wait about 30 minutes. The host was not extremely helpful trying to make me feel better about this and made it worse by how much he referred to us being late. I mean yes we were late, but 5 minutes? Anyway, once we finally got our table with such an awesome view I was very happy and in a great mood. We had several questions about the wine selection which seemed to annoy our server. Otherwise, the service was fine just not the best I've had at fine dining establishments. For the price I was expecting stellar service and food. My boyfriend and I have been to some great fine dining French restaurants (The French Room in Dallas being our favorite). For two people, we ended up spending just over $200.  With all that said, the food was very good and overall our night was very enjoyable. If I return to Las Vegas with someone who hasn't been to Vegas before, I would go back to ETR for the ambiance. If bf and I return within the next couple of years, we will go elsewhere.",

I liked the chocolate for its rich and creamy flavor. Must order it if you have a sweet tooth like me.

This was ridiculous. We told her that we had booked it for 7:45pm but she didn't hear. On top of it she was not at all apologetic for her mistake.  We waited for 15min and then told her we had to go since we had a shoe at 9:00pm. She didn't even try to get a table and not even a word of sorry and she bluntly asked if she can cancel our reservation.

This was my first time at this restaurant, I made my reservation on OpenTable and asked for a table by the window since it was my Mom's first time in Vegas and I wanted to do something nice for her. I honestly thought that my comments would have never been read but they were.  The hostess greeted both of us and told my Mom Happy Birthday.  She was shocked that they knew.  Not only did you get us a table by the window, but we had the corner window.  My mother is from Ohio and I live in California.  When she told me that she wanted to see the Bellagio fountains I thought this this would be the best place.  The service was amazing, I wish I remembered our waitresses name. The food was outstanding.  I had the lamb and my mother had the veal. The wine selection was fantastic. They brought my mom a beautiful birthday desert as well.  I can't say thank you enough to the Eiffel Tower restaurant for making this dinner something that my Mom would never forget.  She was so impressed with everything!  Again can't  say thank you enough.  This is something that my Mother and I will never forget.  Now I need to bring my husband there. I will be back!",

Went on a Saturday night at 7pm.  Had to wait about 20 minutes, but only because my window seat was still being used.  I could have gotten a table early with out a window view, but I didn't mind waiting.  Also, there is plenty of room to seat 10 or so in the waiting area and that does not include people seated at the nearby bar.  Once seated, probably had the best table in the restaurant.  Right in front of the Bellagio fountains.  Food was good.  Got souffle, only one wish is that they would have put a small scoop of vanilla ice cream on the top.  Have seen other restaurants do this.  Jennifer came by and requested me by name to make sure everything was to my liking.  All in all, good time.  A little over $200 for two which includes tip.",

The waitstaff was very attentive and the food was delish, I tried the lamb for the night.

I had my wedding reception here a few years ago and always recommend it to everyone for their \"flawless performance.\"  The night started out bad when we were told that we had to check our nice bottle of (Napa Cab) wine, despite the fact that it does not say it on their web site visibly and when we searched for it on other sites they said it was allowed.  The wine we ended up ordering was nowhere near the quality of the wine we brought.  None of the hosts were very friendly or warm, but I'm assuming that is part of the ambiance.  There was a huge burn mark from a plate on our table.  I asked for the sauce for my steak on the side and it came out covered.  The restaurant is disconnected from the hotel so if you're hoping to add points to any reward card, think again.  The site does say that a jacket is encouraged but clearly not enforced since I saw torn up jeans.  The final end to our evening was the elevator hostess looking like she wanted to hit someone.  When I tried to cheer her up she only scowled at me.  Maybe she was feeling the Parisian vibe as well.  Overall, it was an incredibly expensive evening that was far from the perfect experience I'm used to here.  Sadly, I won't be coming back or recommending it in the future as I had done.   To be balanced, the bus boys were wonderful and the quality of the Filet Mignon was quite high.  However, I feel you can get that in other areas on the strip.",

Even though the restaurant was pretty empty because it was about 5 o'clock, we were still asked to wait until our reservation at 5:15, which was fine but annoying because it was empty.  We got seated and the waitress came around and we were escorted to our seats, which overlooked the bellagio fountain. We were given our choice of bread, which was delicious and a sample of soup. That was nice too.  When we were looking at the menu, there was something I had a question about. When I asked, she talked to me like I was a moron. Lady, I'm in pharmacy school NOT a 2 year old. That kind of annoyed me. Anyways we ordered our food and that was delicious. My friend got the veal medallions and I can't remember the name of what I got. they were both great though!   I felt like the man who was offering bread checked back with us about the food more often than the waitress did. Anyways we had told her in the beginning that we were pressed for time and we told her we didn't want dessert and requested the check. She brought over the check and told us to enjoy the show. We had about 20 minutes to spare before we would have to head over to the show and thought we would be able to make it to the roof top, BUT she didn't even come back after we waited around for 10 minutes. We asked the man that was serving the bread to get her and finally we could leave. Unfortunately it was too late and we couldn't go to the top. It was pretty annoying, if she knew we are pressed for time then she should have grabbed the checkbook from us right away.   Bottom line: Food = excellent, waitstaff = ehh not my fave.",

    "text": "My husband and I came here for lunch on a whim, but mainly because unlike Mon Amie Gabi, this place did not have a wait time. The service is very good and the view is awesome.  We started off with their cucumber lemonade. Great and refreshing, which was especially welcome after walking in the summer heat.  They give you a little amuse bouche with their parmesan rolls to start. I found the amuse bouche really interesting. I don't know what it was made of, but to me it tasted like peas - I love peas. Bread is really good too.  We then had some soups. My husband had the lobster soup with bay scallops and I went with the onion soup. They were both good, but definitely needed salt and pepper in our opinion. The onion soup is also not your typical french onion soup as this one is thinner and made with cream - also, it has no onion pieces.  My husband had the Moroccan lamb burger with potato chips. He thought that it was tasty (I only had the chips) and the little sauce they give you on the side is really good.  I went with their parmesan crusted chicken. That was really tasty. It came accompanied by au gratin potatoes (tasty) and veggies (also tasty).  All, in all, it was a really good meal and was not as expensive as we thought it would be.",

They were able to accommodate the party of 13 we had. Each person was a little over $100. I liked how you could see the kitchen and see where all the magic happened. The lamb was superb! And the souffle is definitely worth it too, I liked how there were different kinds too: vanilla, chocolate,pistachio, and one other one. Definitely worth every bite and memory!",

This restaurant has the most excellent, romantic view you can find anywhere the strip.  This restaurant really lucks out being across the street from the Bellagio fountains.  They perform every 10 - 15 minutes.  You're also in direct view of City Center and Caesar's - right in the middle of the action.    If anything I'd be careful when ordering wine, they're marked up 200% to 300%.   So you're looking at least $90 for a decent bottle.  Which is ok, because of the view, service and the whole experience.  Just get ready to spend at least $250 on your total bill - and have it be worth it.    Make reservations, too.  We did and they gave us a prime table, right next to the window in the corner.  Unbelievable.  Bring your camera and dress up.  This is high class dining people.",

    "text": "If you haven't been, you really need to experience the Eiffel Tower Restaurant. First, the tricky part is to find the elevator, it is somewhere in the middle of the casino (tip: just look up at the legs of the Eiffel Tower because they come through the ceiling and find the middle that way). There were two host's (one female, one male) to greet you at the elevator (I assumed to confirm reservations or whatever), so they tell me that there is a dress code and shorts are going to cut it (it was 112 degrees out and I'm not going to walk around in slacks that for sure), so I turn to Amanda and say sorry, then thank the host anyways. But then he says \"hold on, what size pants are you\", he says we have a couple pairs if you wouldn't mind throwing them on before coming up. I say \"sure\" and I almost dropped my pants right there but he said \"the washroom is just across the way, sir\". As I go change the male host proceeds to escort Amanda up the elevator and to a table. When I finished, the lady kindly escorts me up (I couldn't figure out why we were getting pampered so but then I saw the bill!!).   The elevator was fun, you get a chance to wave or stick up your nose (which ever you prefer) at all the people outside before you get to your floor. So the elevator opens and it's the kitchen, I'm kind of scratching my head but then the lovely host grabs my arm and escorts me around and out of the kitchen then to my table. You have to keep in mind that the pants that they gave me are at least 3 times bigger then I am, so I'm almost waddling try to get to my seat trying to make sure I don't lose the pants and flash all of Vegas.   There are two things that make this restaurant unbelievable. First, the view is amazing, three sides of floor to ceiling glass. One side the north side of the strip, the other the south, but the front is all the Bellagio. If you know anything about the Bellagio, then you know about the musical fountain which occurs every 15 minutes. So you get to watch this show if you have seats in the front (tip for the guys... it's very romantic). The second thing is the menu, it is absolutely insane... Chilled Fennel Vichyssoise with Shrimp, Caviar, fish, fowl, and even a vegetarian dish. Unfortunately for us, we were already full from dinner (fortunate for my wallet though, this place is up there $25 to $55 a plate, $340 for 50 grams** of Caviar). Still, I wish had some caviar, maybe next time. The service was excellent too.   You must go!!   ** 1 gram is about the weight of a Bic pen cap.",

Try to make it a romantic night out with your significant other and request to dine at one of the tables by the window facing the strip. At night, you receive one of the best views of the strip. If you are lucky, you'll also have the opportunity to view the Bellagio fountain show at night from your seats with an aerial view. However, the raving about the environment does not do this establishment enough justice. The food here is delicious, imaginative, and playful. The chefs here aren't afraid to color outside the lines and it shows. Their cold foie gras is a delightful way to enjoy a typically seared liver. I haven't been disappointed with anything I've ordered here. Bon appetit!",

The best part of the restaurant was the bar area and the bar tender Carson.  He was a really good conversationalist and gave me plenty of things to see in Vegas that I might have not seen otherwise.  He also recommended my sandwich after listening to my preferences for food.  He also makes a mean lemonade too!

    "text": "I will describe our Eiffel Tower Restaurant experience in one word, \"Magnifique!\"  I took my wife to this restaurant a little unsure if it was going to be worth the high price tag and it definitely was.  Our bill was $210 w/ tax and tip (18%) and we ordered the following:  1st Course Roasted Foi Gras Appetizer (A++++++++)  Absolutely Marvelous, Pure Heaven! Served on a bed of marinated grapes and julienne crepes the Foi Gras completely melted in our mouths and the three tastes blended together exquisitely.  Entrees Roasted Quail w/ Tarragon Jus & White & Red Cabbage (A++)  Rack of Lamb w/ Tarragon Jus, White Bean Stew & Grilled Sweet Onion (A++++++++++)  Creamed Spinach & Mushroom Side Dish (A++)  We decided to order two entrees, one moderately priced and one high end, in order to stay with our budget.  We shared each of them so we could sample all of the flavors.    The Quail was very good, it was our first time trying it and we would definitely order it again.  Not gamey at all and the meat was so savory.  The only downfall with the Quail is there is not much meat because it is a smaller bird, but great nonetheless.  The cold cabbage side was so good and complemented the bird perfectly.    Now for the Rack of Lamb.  As you may have seen in most of these reviews, everyone loves the lamb.  We will take it one step furthur, we absolutely LUST for this lamb.  WOW quite possibly one of the best lamb dishes I have ever had, mouth watering and succulent, it is a must order on their menu.  The sides again complemented the meat perfectly.  The creamed spinach side was a great complement to the meal and was not overly creamy.  It was perfectly baked and crusty on top, definitely the best creamed spinach dish I have ever had.  Desert Chocolate Souffle (A++++) This unbelievable desert was light, fluffy and oh so chocolatey.  It was the perfect ending to our meal.  Oh and did I mention it is prepared from scatch while you eat, takes about a half hour.  Drinks Two Glasses of the house Pinot Noir which was very good for their house wine and the wife had a specialty cocktail called \"Autumn in Paris\" which was fresh crushed pears with vodka and some other fresh things mixed in, in her words, \"It was to die for!\"  They give you your choice of complementary breads and some finger food desert chocolates and pastries....do yourself a favor and try their french baguettes w/ their house butter and the chocolates filled with caramel syrup, unreal!  All in all we will be coming here everytime we are in Vegas.  The service is way above par and attentive to your every need and the views are stunning.  Whether its the Paris Balloon or the Belagio Fountains you will be in heaven once the ambiance and food mingle together to tickle your senses. Just make sure you give yourself at least two hours for this dining experience.  Happy Eating!",

I have been lucky enough to go to the real Paris, France a few times and have had some very fine French food while there so of course I was prepared to label this the Vegas version, good enough for the tourist only. I was so wrong. They had a huge staff of chefs working the kitchen which you see as soon as you step off the elevator. The head chef Jean Joho certainly knows what he is doing. The appetizer of warm fois gras with crumbled bacon which I spread on a baguette was super rich and addictive. We also tried the seared scallop appetizer which were two of the best tasting giant scallops I have ever had with a sort of pesto flavored couscous on them. They were awesome. For entrees we had a house specialty which was a olive oil poached halibut which was absolutely the best fish I have ever had in my life. I personally had the seared rare duck which was also brilliant. Desserts were a caramel souffle that they began baking for us 40 minutes before we finished dinner so it was piping hot at the perfect time along with a fantastic creme brulee. We had a table facing the strip and the Bellagio fountains and while the sun slowly set and all the lights came up, made for an incredible view during dinner. This place will cost you, no doubt. But if you appreciate French food and want a super special view and experience, I would recommend it highly.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I got engaged on August 27th and I made a reservation at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant to celebrate.  We were greeted warmly at the top of the elevator and the lady asked what we were celebrating.  We told her that we had just gotten engaged a few hours before and she excitedly asked to see my fiancee's ring.  She then walked us over to the front desk and told the lady there about our engagement.  They congratulated us and seated us at a window table.  The view was fantastic!  My fiancee was staring at the fountains and I had a view straight down The Strip.  The wait staff was very friendly and professional.  We ordered champagne and salad to start.  The salad was delicious!  They then brought us bread and a corn dish that we did not catch the name of.  It was a free sampler but quite tasty.  I ordered the slow roasted filet of Atlantic salmon.  My fiancee ordered the baked herb crepes.  Both dishes were amazing!  We both had a few bites of the other's dish.  Now we aren't the types to usually have an expensive meal but since we were celebrating our engagement the price was not an issue for me at all.  I have nothing but good things to say about the experience and we definitely plan on coming back for future celebrations.",

    "text": "Reviewing a place like this is very hard. It is Las Vegas. We had an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains.  We decided on the tasting menu with wine pairings. This is always interesting as restaurants give me wines I wouldn't ordinarily try. The prices are absolutely in the extreme nose bleed range. So to break out of the 3 or 4 star range they have to do something to knock my socks off. Everything was very competently done. Flavors excellent. Service impeccable. The deal clincher was the venison. When I hear venison, my mind goes immediately to a poor gamey tasting deer that was shot and driven around on some rednecks hood for a day. I would never ever ever order venison. The meat course was venison. I was worried. When it arrived, it was the most amazing piece of venison  (maybe any kind of meat) I have ever tasted. I'll ding them just a bit for the short pour of the Anderson Valley Cabernet that came with. So 4.9 on my scale. For here I'll give them a 5 because I can't give them 4.9 and 4.9 is closer to 5 than 4. Remember this is Las Vegas....",

The view was nothing short of incredible. The ambiance was perfect. I had the beef wellington and my husband had the surf and turf. We have been ranting and raving about our meals since we left. The deserts were also fantastic I had the chocolate plate which was heavenly and my hubby had the creme brulee which he describes as the best he had in Las Vegas! The servers were very attentive, but not intrusive. We enjoyed this meal so much that we are seriously considering booking our next stay at the Paris Hotel!",

    "text": "We had to wait 10-15 minutes to be seated when seats seemed plentiful we were provided  an excellent table though. Server strongly suggested we have a BLT or hamburger which we were not interested in and ordered steaks as we wished along with a Cadillac margarita but received a standard version. Now the real issue was two- fold the server obviously lost track of our order as our plates were cleared after our salad and table crumbed and then a host/manager came over and asked how was everything and we let him know we had not even eaten yet as it seems our table was mixed up with the one next to us, perhaps? Waiter never came by and checked on us and offered no apology when we informed him we never received our lunch as he also was asking if we wanted dessert as well. We finally received our meals and although ordered medium rare for both we both received raw, very raw and pretty poor quality steaks. I sent mine back but my wife was going to deal with hers until she  decided she could no  longer so she just left it. Got a re-fire,again with no apology. I do not like to complain but I felt I had to look for a manager and after seeking one out because our waiter was missing of course we in the end did receive a visit from Sharon  who was very helpful and understanding and we were able to show her the raw steak which she agreed was raw. Sharon was outstanding and apologetic and took care of the check as well as offering up dessert (Creme Brulee which was excellent) She did ask that we go through her for a reservation next time we are in town and she assured good results. With that said after this experience and the quality of the steak I just can't see going here for dinner and expecting high quality food or service so we will most likely pass. This was an extremely dissatisfying experience and surely the most disappointing one in a high end type place. The lunch took about an hour and 40 minutes filled with errors. 20th anniversary lunch what a mess.",

    "text": "Just back from Vegas where it felt like the French invasion.  Yet despite running into French people everywhere (convention in town, or just the low value of the dollar?), my friend and I made an Opentable reservation last week for the Eiffel Tower, where we'd first met on a Euro tour ten years ago.  I was worried that it would be a cheesy experience or that it would go to the opposite end of the spectrum and be completely overwhelming for us girls brought up in small towns.  Yeah, we've eaten at some pretty shwanky places, but sometimes they can be intimidating even for the experienced.  We just wanted a nice evening with good food, good service, and good ambiance.  We were not disappointed!  Not only was it not cheesy, but nor was it overwhelming.  Okay, maybe the wine list was, but that was offset by the fabulous somelier who made it easy for us.  Our wait staff was awesome and not overbearing, yet there when we needed them.  The food - omigoodness, we skipped lunch so that we'd be super hungry, and we still wished we could have eaten more.  Okay, so your pocket also needs to be just as full as your stomach empty when you arrive, but hopefully you've figured that out with other reviews and are appropriately prepared when you get the bill.  The view - again, omigoodness!  The fountains of Bellagio come to life and depending on where you sit you may have great view of the Strip.  I must admit that I didn't expect much with Opentable reservations, but I was not at all disappointed.  We had a window seat (most of the window seats appeared to be for pairs), but it seems that even those behind us in booths probably still had excellent views.  Okay, best part of all?  Dessert.  Yeah, I was really ready to skip it, but my friend talked me into it.  That's what splurge night is all about, right?  And skipping lunch, going to the gym?  I swear I could not have eaten another bite when it came time for dessert.  Yet I still managed to order the grand marnier souffle, while she had the chocolate souffle.  I always order chocolate, so it was good to mix things up.  Oooooh, it was so decadent and so light that of course I ate every single bite.  How?  I don't know, but it was fabulous.  And then, when the pusher decides she can only eat half of her chocolate souffle, what do I do?  I finish hers, of course.  Other fun parts of the evening included the people watching.  The couple at the next table appeared to be an escort and her jean wearing date.  Her phone calls in the bathroom to what seemed to be her boyfriend left behind at home were especially entertaining.  That she had her crackberry sitting on the table texting in between courses was just pathetic.  But if she was an escort, what's with the photos?  Oh, yeah, probably for his buddies that he wanted to impress.  We started off with drinks before hand at Mon Ami Gabi in the cafe with the again lovely view of the Bellagio.  Strong drinks!  It was a nice way to get started before heading to the more elegant Eiffel Tower Restaurant.  Go, be prepared to be wooed, and go for a special occasion.  Having dinner like this too often will spoil you for every day restaurants.  What we had:  Tomato mozzerella salad (she's from Canada, where as I get this all the time at home) Corn with peeky toe crab soup (LOVE IT) Duck two ways (cooked perfectly, wished I could have eaten more of it) Beef Wellington (cut like butter) Potatoes gratin (enough for two to share) Asparagus in brown butter Grand marnier souffle Chocolate souffle Chateauneuf-du-Pape wine  I wish we'd had the wine opened sooner (which means I wish we'd have chosen which wine sooner) and I wish we'd asked for a carafe earlier so that the wine was more open by the time our dinner arrived.  That was the only bleep on the evening.  We probably should have also just ordered a few glasses since we'd had a few martini's before dinner.  (on an empty stomach, not so smart)",

Needless to say.. we loved it so much that the price didn't bother to us. The view was so beautiful especially sitting right in front of the bellagio and watching the watershow.. was unforgettable and amazing to experience. other info~~~ bread was so.. perfect and PERFECT! souffle was.. delish.. BUT don't get the caramel (i got that and regretted it) my dad got the chocolate which was SOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD~! and my grandma got the pistachio which was eh~ and don't spill anything! because even a bread crumb will have your server coming to swipe it with a silver scooper thing. my brother spilled the creamed spinach and our server had to scrape that off too before my brother even got to eat it. they also give you new utensils for each course. omgosh omgosh one more thing.. i almost never eat butter or margarine unless it's made with a dish. but i just spread a hint of their butter on my french baguette and ended up eating half of the butter square which was huge. so light and perfect just the way i like it.  at the end of our meal, we didn't even feel full. The portions were just right, but if you're looking for a hearty meal like my younger brother.. do what he did and get yourself a pan of pizza afterwards!  i have pictures.. will upload asap~!",

Food is average at best, decent presentation and not a bad meal, but certainly not memorable. The service was below average - extremely slow, rather cold and unfriendly (with the exception of the person that escorted us up to the restaurant from the ground floor) and they never checked in on us - not once. And it was off-lunch hours (i.e. 3 pm) so there were only a handful of people seated so we are not sure the reason for he hold up. Plenty of wait staff around - just not actually coming by the tables. We could hear other guests complaining as well - one couple was comped one meal and a free dessert as they were quite vocal in their disappointment with both food and service. We didn't bother to complain - we really enjoyed the views and were glad we had the experience. However, we would not likely return nor recommend it for more than a cocktail.",

    "text": "My girlfriend handpicked this restaurant for her 24th birthday dinner, which was the reason we cited for coming to Vegas. She is a lover of French food and is particular about authenticity as she spent some time studying abroad over there.  We were staying at the Bellagio, across from Paris, which is a short walk using the overpass walkway. I made 7pm reservations for two. When we had arrived, nearly all window seats were taken, but we were able to snag one without wait.  Our orders: - Eiffel Affair (drink) $19 - way pricey for what it is. When I see a drink at $20, I expect something spectacular, or at the very least unique. It was cool that this drink had actual berries in it, but was not worth $20. - Escargot $20 - this was strictly for my girlfriend. She did comment that it was not like traditional escargot and seemed a bit disappointed with the dish. I ate the poached egg, and it was done correctly (spills everywhere when punctured). - Lamb $46 - which was cited as Eiffel Tower Restaurant's best dish by our waiter.. it was amazing. Both tender and flavorful, and I haven't enjoyed lamb the same way since. The serving is generous. - Sea Bass $44  The view was very nice and the service was excellent. Our server was very attentive and not overbearing. He took several pictures for us. Truly a romantic dinner.  In the end, although I found Eiffel Tower Restaurant very romantic, and food reasonably priced, it sort of bothers me how much their drinks cost here. That, and my girlfriend and I both agreed that although we enjoyed dining at ETR, we probably would try other places before returning. But definitely try this place once for a special night! It certainly has real WOW factor. 4/5 stars.  Check out my photos for a pic of the $20 drink, escargot, and lamb.",

What minor flaws there might be in food are most certainly made up for in service and he prices are great for what you are getting.",

Not the best dressed as I was walking in, my husband had to lose his ball cap... but we weren't treated any differently. Tatiana was our hostess, greeted us and made us feel welcome. We didn't have a reservation so no window seat, but she sat us where we had a good view. The food... Impeccable! We ordered the filet mignon and you could cut it with a butter knife. The truffle was delicious, and my first. Overall experience was great, I will definitely visit again... This time I will be sure to make a reservation.",

The waitstaff appears to be nice, but does not posses genuine quality service skills. Reaching over diner to fill water, serving from the wrong side, bringing dishes in the wrong order, and errors on the order. Plated temperature indicates lack of coordination of food prep. Some items too hot, some room temp on the same plate.  The ambiance and decor intend to be upscale, as do the prices, but there are many True high end dining experiences which are better than this place.",

They were cold, mushy and didn't have much flavor.   I highly recommend the chocolate souffle. It was delicious.   Complaint. If you are going to have a dress code it needs to be enforced.

    "text": "I considered a single star for this review but I feel that Yelp is often drowning in hyperbole. If the collective internet beats its chest and hoots about how ever little moment is the \"best\" and \"worst\" then the praise and admonition lose their value so I will simply start with this; our dinner at Eiffel Tower on Saturday was a tremendous disappointment and we will not return.  Dinner started well enough. We were seated at a lovely two top which offered a view of sunset playing out over the Bellagio's fountain and the visually arresting architecture of City Center. The ambiance of Eiffel Tower itself was lovely and made clear that wasn't just a window to look out! We should expect great things! These expectations went unmet.  Dinner started well enough a cucumber palette cleanser and Cold Foie Gras Torchon. Then our entrees arrived and things went down hill fast. I tucked into my rabbit to find the preparation unengaging, bland and forgettable. There was nothing about it that made clear why lapin is a cornerstone of classic French cuisine. As our appetizer, ambiance and service thus far had been good I was prepared to work through my concerns. Then my wife cut into her filet. A steak ordered medium rare was served somewhere between medium well and well done. She took a bite hoping that the steak was salvageable and it wasn't. When our server returned my wife shared her concern and the server's response was to shield the steak from the sun with her hand and to tell my wife that her eyes were playing tricks on her and that this gray mass was a medium rare steak. As my wife opened her mouth to reply the server, having realized how gauche response to situation was cut my wife off and said \"Unless of course you tried it. Then you know it is overdone.\" My wife affirmed that this was the case. Her food was taken up as I continued poking through my rabbit.  I had taken the last bite of my rabbit and without a word a busser swooped onto our table and wordlessly grabbed my plate. I'd yet to even have a bite of the wild mushrooms I'd ordered or the potatoes but the plate was snatched and gone before I could say a word. When a new steak was brought out we had to ask for fresh silver and a new plate just so I could sample the accompaniments I ordered.  As our meal drew to a close and my wife and I prepared to leave the same over active busser returned to our table. His arms already full from another two top he had cleared and he began to grab our plates. He was, by the way, the third employee to step on my foot to reach over me that evening. It was obvious his arms were too full and that he was having difficulty maintaing balance in his hands as he put the last plate into his arms the whole thing gave way and he managed to drop our dishes all over my dinner jacket and slacks, covering them in potatoes. He hurriedly gathering them back up and rushed away without acknowledging the oil stain that will require dry cleaning on my jacket.  My wife and I would have asked to speak to a manager regarding dinner but we had tickets for a show at Bally's and had to leave. I can't in good faith suggest this place to anyone but Is suppose Beth and I could have just been terribly unlucky.",

Upon entering the dining room (passing through some of the pristine food prep areas), I was struck by the LOOK of it all - the immaculate tables, all the customers dressed nicely, and of course, the view. Go at night, you'll be entertained by the Bellagio fountains all night. Both times I've been here, I was lucky enough to have been sat at the window and all night it was a treat.  I can't say enough about the food and service here. This is a \"fancy\" restaurant and they don't disappoint. Everything I've tried there was fantastic. I had beef Wellington and it was superb, and they gave a very generous portion, and was made perfectly. One in our party did have an issue with the dish he had (it was cooked too much), but once we mentioned it to our server, the problem and food were fixed immediately.   Service is excellent and get top marks. Call ahead for reservations.",

Allen recommended a few dishes for us and then Chef produced magic...the seafood salad was buttery, fresh and crisp, the pasta, the chicken was comforting and pairing well with the pinot grigio and cabernet sauvignon. The view isn't on the menu but it might as well be...our table couldn't be more perfect. The manager knew exactly what we needed and asked to seat us at 5A...wow!

We did have some non alcoholic drinks at the bar - the mocktail menu was interesting, but the Reve and Chocolate Valencia were not exciting. I would not come back here again unless the menu changed.

    "text": "Yes, it's extremely over priced, but I'm not even going to comment on it as an issue because our total experience had far more severe worries.   Cons: - My boyfriend was not in the mood to drink, but the severs continually offered him alcohol. A person can only say no so many ways. It made us uncomfortable.  - His steak was far too tough and tasteless. He had to use a lot of lemon butter to even be able to eat it. Ruth's Chris has far better steaks. The Eiffel's steak was comparable to Applebee's. It was also poorly plated and phallic shaped. Don't worry I will post the picture because it's hilarious on so many levels.  - When the server asked if we were enjoying our food, my boyfriend expressed his dislike for the steak. She offered to get him a new piece, but we didn't have time to wait because we were going to a show right after of which the staff was already aware. At that point a discount, or another solution to remedy the situation should have been offered. - As we were leaving we were asked again how everything was and we said it was just ok, but again no one expressed regret. They seemed shocked as if they're so used to tourists being happy enough to just be there that they didn't know what to say or do. - The coup de grace was as we stood and waited for the elevator, a line of male kitchen staff members rudely stared at me in an inappropriate manner.   Pros: - The view is phenomenal. My boyfriend and I were lucky enough to get a table right by the window as the Bellagio fountains began. This is obviously for what you're paying.   It should also be noted that while it had nothing to do with our experience, a couple two tables down from us found a HAIR in their food.",

Enjoy the view with your mom!\" How could I say no, this would be a great experience. Once we rode the elevator upstairs to the 11th floor he told me to wait right there and he'll get me a jacket. He came back with a 44 regular. Perfect size. The hostess brought us to a window seat with a perfect view of the Bellagio water  show. When the waiter came, he was very nice and patient as it took us a little while to take the pictures and pick out the lunch. I thought it was very nice of him to tell me about the classic \"m\" burger. As he described it, the chef is from France and cannot pronounce \"Hamburger,\" so in result when he tries to say it, it sounds like \"M\" burger. Anyways, I got the Lamb burger and my mom got the \"M\" burger.   When it arrived, it was a pretty big burger, both of them! They cooked it to perfection, not too dry and not overcooked and hard.",

We received a military discount even though he's a veteran, they still honored the discount for $10 per person, which was nice. I think the prices increase for night time viewing as I would imagine all of the lights make it a spectacular view. We went during the day. You take a super fast elevator to the top...it was kinda scary. When you reach the top the weather is a bit windy and cool (it's February). We got to see the Bellagio fountain show when we were up there and that was pretty cool. I think the price is pretty steep for this but if you can utilize a discount, go for it. But it's Vegas, everything is pretty steep because people are willing to pay. I think this is great for kids and a great view of the fountain show.  Probably an even better show for nighttime viewing.",

The service is excellent and the menu variety is impressive. The food is delicious. I ordered the market green salad followed by the Alaskan wild cod. Both dishes were absolutely delicious. My friend ordered the butternut squash soup, which is seasonal, followed by the salmon entree, and those were delicious as well. For dessert, we ordered a souffle, which I recommend ordering as soon as you know you want it because it does take time to make. We were told that they were being started as soon as we got our entrees so that they would be ready. My friend ordered the chocolate souffle which was delicious. I was told that the Apple souffle was incredible so I ordered that. I was somewhat disappointed. It was not that impressive to me and I wish I would have gone with a different flavor. I would not recommend the Apple souffle to anyone because I found it flat.  The prices are not cheap. For two of us, with one glass of Bordeaux wine per person, the appetizers, the entrees, and dessert, the total was around $250. There is a seven course tasting menu available that, without wine, is $145 per person, and with wine you have to add roughly about $90 per person. The attire should be appropriate. Business casual is perfectly appropriate.",

From the moment you arrive step out from the triangle elevator, a cleaned well decorated open kitchen in front of you. It's Vegas, restaurant souvenirs lay it out loudly. The restaurant itself it's beautiful, overlooking Bellagio fountains and the strip. The food we ordered, everything is good and servers are extremely well trained and professional. From seafood, fish, lamb, to steaks.... outstanding. If I have to pick a flaw, the wait time for food to arrive can be long. But as soon as we told the waiter we are catching up a show, immediately no problems. I'm so happy we were there. It is one of the highlights of our trip. Bravo to everyone who works really hard to deliver ultimate dinning experience.  If you are coming to Vegas, make a reservation dine here. It's packed and busy every night.",

I loved that!! We have the fountain as the background in our pix! Yippee!!!   Everything was awesome here, we'll definitely be back!

The Eiffel Tower however, absolutely blew me away. On a whim I decided to treat myself to brunch.   To my great surprise I was shown to the prefect table right in a window overlooking the Bellagio fountains. My server was warm yet efficient. His assistant was equally professional and turned out to be the son of the main guy.   After perusing the menu I settled on the lobster eggs Benedict. To start I had a small but delicious green salad. Oh, and the white peach mimosa was a great compliment to both. Everything was perfect. I mean seriously perfect. Even though I was stuffed, I couldn't help ordering the chocolate lava cake. Yum.   Can't wait to go back and try their dinner offerings!",

So prepare to spend $100 pp. I splurged more than anyone in the group cuz I'm a foodie (why not, it's not an everyday meal). I got the Eiffel Affair cocktail, coffee, smoked salmon, rack of roasted lamb, roasted spinach and mushroom. It was a very delicious meal, food was on point, and my lamb came out medium just as requested.  Ambiance was also great, staff are very friendly and courteous, walkways around tables are narrow and can get crowded, but no matter how busy they are, all the staff are trained to step aside and let you thru first. Bathroom had someone in there to hand you paper towels all day.  Also wanted to mention, we had a very booked night, staff worked diligently and got us our food, FAST. They were all very attentive and great to work with!",

I went with a group and we all got the Thanksgiving dinner special.  I believe it included an app, main course and a desert.  I'm not much of a wine guy but we did get whatever pairing of red wine they recommended to go with the turkey, and it was very good.  The Turkey was awesome, cooked great, some light and dark meat, some awesome stuffing, great cranberry sauce/spread.    The thing that stood out most in my mind though was the desert.  Best pecan pie I've ever had.  Hands down.  I will have to see if they have pecan pie available next time I'm in Vegas, if they have it when you're there, I'd recommend it.  Came with a scoop of ice cream, cold ice cream with warm pecan pie, delicious.  The service was very good, atmosphere of the place, views, it was a good dining experience.  If I had to pick something I didn't like it was the lady at the podium on the ground level, when we made a reservation with her a few days before she made some condescending remarks about our dress at the time which I thought were uncalled for.  I'm not counting that as part of the dining experience though, so 5 stars from me!",

Upon exiting the elevator you enter what looks like the kitchen area and it smells amazing. You can see chefs (or people dressed up as chefs) walking around preparing food and other items. The seating area gives you an excellent view of the Caesars Palace front water area and the Bellagio dancing fountains. That back drop makes for an amazing dinning experience.   We went with a larger group and they were very accommodating. Our serveur (waiter) was very nice to us and explained some of the stuff that was foreign without making us feel dumb. He provided us with a very nice champagne to help us toast a very special occasion. The desserts were over the top good and helped top off a great experience.",

After you finish washing your hands, she gives you a pretty towel with the Eiffel Tower Restaurant Logo.  Anyways, we get seated and a waiter begins to recommend dishes for you. You can feel the professionalism of the atmosphere and everything is in tip-top shape.  We Ordered: 1. Duck Breast 2. Beef Wellington 3. Grilled Salmon 4. Rabbit with a light Mustard sauce 5. Beef Tenderloin 6. Escargot 7. Duck Liver 8. Chocolate Souffle 9. Strawberry Souffle  The appetizer that comes is a spinach soup I believe.

Take the elevator up to the open kitchen then be seated in the multi-level dining room.  James was our expert server this evening, and he did a nice job tending to a table of eight.  Food was very good, but not unbelievable.  Vegas prices set the expectations bar high for most of us, and that bar simply wasn't achieved.  We were greeted by a nice little amuse bouche of cauliflower, a surprise that was both tasty and welcome.  A bread selection was offered and along with soft butter was a crusty treat.  I liked the rustic variety.  Appys:  The Maine Lobster Salad with Roasted Butternut Squash, Wilted Kale and Old Cider Vinaigrette was tasty enough, albeit a small portion for $24.  The Cold Smoked Salmon with Classic Condiments was very good at $19 and more substantial than the lobster.  Entrees:  James told us a story about the Duke of Wellington and Napolean that prompted an order of the Beef Wellington.  The preparation was classic, though without the liver pate.  Actually that is the way my fellow diner preferred it, and the dish came out perfectly prepared, medium rare and delicious.  Two others, including myself, ordered the short ribs which were underwhelming.  Four small bits of beef were accompanied by several baby carrots and three baby onions.  The brown sauce adorning the plate was a little too forward for my taste and quite a bit different from what we are used to eating in most establishments.  I want to say it was vinegar-ey, but I really am not sure what the unique flavor I tasted was.  I miss my Cafe 14 in Agoura Hills' short ribs!!!  Dessert included a caramel souffle which, too, was underwhelming.  Flavor was very light, even with the requisite caramel sauce.  If you go for the souffle I would recommend the chocolate variety.  We are used to paying Vegas prices, but although the Eiffel Tower had great vistas and good service, the value equation wasn't there at these high prices.  C'est la vie!",

We went for lunch before returning to LA and decide to do a last celebration for my birthday and our anniversary. Everything was perfect from beginning to end and we were really happy with the delicious treat they gave us for the occasion. I love this place, the food is delicious and the service is impeccable! Every dollar you spend is totally worth it.",

One of my friends got married at the Paris and had the reception at this location. The staff were friendly, efficient and great at their jobs. The hors d'oeuvres were amazing. Sirlon burgers, puffed pastries with mushrooms, and salmon wraps with caviar to name a few. Everything went perfectly including the red velvet wedding cake with raspberry sauce. Wow!  If the air conditioning kept up with the crowd, I would give them 5 stars immediately. I realize during an afternoon in Vegas, with that many windows, it has to be hard to keep things cool.   I would definitely like to visit this location again for dinner.",

    "text": "3 stars for food and five stars for service, but I am going to round because they forgot the most important thing!  I had made reservations to celebrate my mom's birthday. When I had called, they had asked if we were there for a special occasion and I had mentioned that we were there for a birthday.However, once we got there, they made no mention of it. It wouldn't have been a big deal but everyone else on yelp had their birthday person recognized.   Why ask and then not follow through? Not cool. Not cool at all.   Service is outstanding! We started off with the amuse bouche, which consisted of a cauliflower mousse. Absolutely delicious. The servers kept coming back and forth to make sure we had enough bread and water. Kept cleaning our table over and over. They had this little bread crumb lifter that removed all the crumbs. That's high class! Their waitstaff is awesome and for that alone I would say go.   My mom got the recommended parmesean crusted  chicken while I got the lamb burger. She liked the chicken but it was a little to heavy for me. I got the lamb burger, but it was a little too strong for me, so I'd have to pass. We both ordered a non-alcoholic lime drink which was tasty and a great alternative to the alky.  We ended up getting our own dessert, the strawberry souffle with pistachios. Kind of reminded us of strawberry ice cream since they freeze it, but a nice option to the end of the meal.   Would I go again? I don't know. I usually go to Vegas for celebrations, either birthdays or graduations and such, so we usually go all out. But not remembering a birthday of a guest is a big no-no, especially at a place that has such a high level of service. Joel Robuchon definitely remembered. At least I took her to go see O.",

A window seat here is worth the wait, with views overlooking the Bellagio fountains that I really never get tired of watching.  Service from our waiter was professional, but not warm nor inviting.  Apps: Seared sea scallops were great. Forget what else was ordered. Entrees: Liked the Dover sole, loved the Beef Wellington, which was cooked perfectly and full of flavor. Dessert: Highly recommend trying a souffle...amazing.  A nice, romantic restaurant that I would recommend trying.",

    "text": "One of my favorite restaurants to eat in Vegas with a view of the world famous Bellagio fountains. Highly recommended to get reservations here as they ask for your name when you arrive at the kiosk by the elevator. In order to eat here, you have to go through the center of the Paris hotel casino in an elevator. At the top you arrive to the kitchen and see how well and clean your food is prepared. Very authentic french. Very cool.   Pros:  Well prepared food and attention to detail in their food presentation. They show how the French take pride in their food. I went with their 5-course menu and Ordered the filet mignon as I always do paired with wine. I personally prefer quality over quantity unlike Italian food and this place lived up to my expectations. Ever bite of every course was tasteful and prepared well with the right ingredients and pairings. Of course I had a glass of Cabernet to go with my entree. For desert I absolutely loved the Chocolate suffle - se parfait! It is prepared in advance when you first order as it takes time to freshly bake. My waiter even pours the chocolate filling for me when served so it is served right.   Impeccable Service that is second to none and set the bar so high for me. I have yet to go a restaurant with comparable service. You get your personalized waiter along who can offer to serve you the entire time speaking french. Again very cool! They actually pay attention to your needs and seem to know what you you need throughout your eating experience without being annoying. Between courses they clean any crumbs off the table. Wow! I feel like a king!   Cons: Not much. Pricey but you get what you pay for. A memorable experience every time.",

    "text": "This review is for our lunch experience on a Sunday.  I can't speak to the dinner service, but if it's anything like lunch, then you're in for a treat.  To start, we didn't have reservations, but it was a Sunday and we decided to take our chances.  Thank god we did, because we were quickly seated at a table with a gorgeous view of the strip including the Bellagio fountains.    Then came Todd Smith.  Oh Todd, I would marry you if I could, but I don't think my husband would appreciate it.  On second thought, he probably wouldn't mind because Todd was amazing.  The right amount of service, charm, and all the right suggestions.  For starters was an amuse bouche of what I think was mushroom flan coupled with some cheese gougeres, better known as fancy french cheese puffs.  They were both delicious.  I was pretty close to asking for a few more puffs, but then out came our lunches.  I had their version of a caprese salad, served with heirloom tomatoes, fresh mozarella, and basil infused water.  I know, basil water? Initally, I thought it was a whole cup of dressing, but I was corrected, and he poured away. Delicious.  Refreshing and light with just the right amount of basil.  I'd order that again.  My hb had the lamb burger.  I was hesitant at first because while I love lamb, it can easily be ruined. This burger, oh this burger, was just so good.  It had a slight taste of curry, and a bit of a spice kick.  Cooked to a medium perfection, and served with a roasted red pepper relish.  I would definitely order that again.  We finished off brunch with the stuffed french toast.  When we ordered this, I thought I would be stuffed myself, but it was a perfect sized portion for the 2 of us.  It wasn't too sweet, which was a pleasant surprise, and was served with the thinnest piece of crispy bacon.  Perfect balance of salty and sweet.  Brunch prices were reasonable and considering we loved everything we had, I'd say it was well worth it.  That, and the service from Todd, the busser, and pretty much all the staff made this a perfect lunch.",

Since it was the weekend we saw the fountains go off every 15 minutes.  The sommelier was very friendly and helped us pick a nice French wine. I fell in love with that wine and hope to find it somewhere to buy for my own collection.  The food was good but not like omg I can't believe how good this is. I had the Caesar salad, scallops, Wellington, au gratin and Brussels sprouts. Everything was delicious.  The Wellington was prepared nicely, I feel like there were mushrooms or something in the pastry as well. All very good flavors. The scallops had a vegetable or something with it and that was really tasty. I enjoyed the different way of preparing a Caesar salad, he kept the romaine leaves in tact, it was nice and crunchy.   They were so nice, they brought me a birthday dessert and it was good.  I was going to order the obligatory souffle, but I just have a thing for creme brulee and theirs was delicious. It was not very thick like any other brulee I have had, but it was good. I kind of think I liked the free little birthday taster they gave me, some type of chocolate mousse thing.   Enjoyed my birthday dinner. View and ambiance is fabulous!   I guess you can come and just enjoy the bar and the ambiance if you don't want to eat here. I think I'd like to do that in the future, just get dressed up and enjoy the Vegas strip view.",

It was an early evening at the Paris casino and we were gambling at one of the Buffalo gold machines, my fiance ended up doing well on the slot machine. Right before we started gambling we were talking about different places to eat. As soon as that happened,  we decided it was finally time to see what the Eiffel Tower had to offer. We were not dressed super fancy as we would have been knowing we were going here, but they were nice enough to offer my fiance a shirt to wear so that we could dine there. We had no reservation so we had to wait a little bit at the bar. The bartender was great and made a perfect Martini. It wasn't long until we were brought into the restaurant. We were seated facing the Bellagio fountain at a beautiful, small table in the back of the restaurant. They brought out a few different things before appetizer arrived. I believe we split a salad and the salmon. Everything was delicious, the service was great, the ambience was very romantic. This is a perfect place to bring your date. I'm so glad we finally got to have this experience.",

The food is good, but for some reason, the temperature of the food is off - maybe because they are doing course meal and the restaurant was fully booked.  The service is good. But the live band playing was awful. The music they played was mostly 50's and 60's and it wasn't upbeat enough for the occasion.  The last sitting was $500 per person plus tax and gratuity excluding drinks. So, if you're Party can drink, be prepared, a cocktail is $30.",

We were greeted and the hostess was very polite. The bread guy was awesome and the bread was just fantastic! Our waitress was lovely and made some great recommendations. We ordered the chocolate souffle at the end and it was delicious. My (now) fiancee actually proposed prior to dinner and it was a prefect spot to do this My only complaint here is that the restaurant did not even offer a dessert (shared) or drink on the house as a compliment to us just being engaged. Most restaurants offer some sort of compliments and we got a monotone \"oh congratulations\" from the server.  A bit disappointing since my fiancee held this monumental moment at their restaurant! If it wasnt for this, I wouldve given a 4 star review",

    "text": "Living in the San Gabriel Valley, I have ready access to a ton of delicious Asian food, so I decided to try more European and Western flavors on my weekend getaway in Las Vegas. I told my girlfriend I was in the mood for French cuisine, and she likes restaurants with nice ambiences, so we decided to pick a restaurant with both. Eiffel Tower is a restaurant that requires an elevator ride to get up to.  We were seated at a table that had a clear view of the city, including Bellagio Fountains as well as the lights at The Cosmopolitan. The light show helped set the mood for a very romantic dinner.  Drink wise, I got a virgin pina colada, and my girlfriend got some type of wine. We both loved our drinks. For me, I typically find pina coladas to be too icy and too sweet sometimes - not this time, this pina colada was mostly liquid and also not too sweet.  I was in a mood for beef wellington, which I hadn't had in a while. I ordered that, while my girlfriend got the NY Strip Steak. The restaurant also serves complimentary bread, which was filling but nothing particularly special.  The steaks were the highlight of the meal. I tried some of my girlfriend's strip steak, and it was by far the best steak I've ever had in my life. Granted, I don't eat steak that often, but I've had steak many times in Los Angeles and a handful of times in other places - this steak was very juicy, flavorful, and had a crispy texture on the outside. The beef wellington was also incredibly tasty. Both meats were medium rare, and both of them cut very easily. The wellington was just right, and the puff pastry was incredibly flavorful.  This is a very expensive restaurant, but then again, so are most restaurants in the Strip of Las Vegas. I highly recommend this place as a once in a few years romantic date for someone special.",

The lobster Benedict was probably the best eggs Benedict I've ever had. I usually can't finish a whole restaurant portion, but there wasn't a crumb left on my plate afterwards. My boyfriend's chicken was super juicy and delicious as well. This is a great restaurant and I really recommend it if you're in Vegas.",

I had a lobster salad and a glass of white wine, and thoroughly enjoyed taking in the view of the lake. Since it was lunch the service was more relaxed which was fine.

We had 70 people and a mix of sit down and standing cocktail tables which was a great layout for us since there was enough room to move + We had a great view of the Bellagio fountains, the strip, and the bonus fireworks from Caesars across the street!  + We had a carving station and it was DELISH! There was even a line for it and everybody raved about it afterward + All of the servers were very accommodating and they always made sure we had drinks and/or food in our hands + All of the hors d'oeuvres that I selected were delicious and everybody enjoyed them + The price point is fair for an on-strip restaurant (a few other restaurants that I looked at were $$$$$$$) + Outside photography is allowed + Children are allowed here (a few places on the strip were 21+ only) + I was able to pre-select wine and champagne prior to the event + We were able to charge alcohol on consumption vs. open bar, since open bar would have counted for everybody (even those who don't drink) + I received prompt responses from the general manager, Scott Clark, and the director of events, Chloe Linder whenever I had an inquiry + An employee was able to hook up an HDMI cable to a laptop for my maid of honor's speech  CONS: - When we signed our contract, we were provided with event pricing for 2015 and had to pay the 2016 pricing which increased, but we weren't aware of new pricing until I asked for an updated menu 30 days prior to our event - We ran a little over our allotted 3 hour time slot and the server said \"You have this room booked until 9:30pm and it's over that time now\" which led me to asking to close out -- I feel like we should've received a 15 minute warning prior to 9:30pm because we were having so much fun and didn't realize the time - We were told that microphones weren't allowed for our best man/maid of honor speeches prior to the event due to the open space (so it wouldn't bother other diners), but during the event, one of the employees went to look for a microphone because she said it would be okay  Overall, I had a great experience hosting our cocktail reception here and would recommend the Eiffel Tower as a great restaurant on the strip for any special occasion!",

    "text": "A Nitty-Gritty Layman's Guide to the Eiffel Tower Restaurant  Reservations:  A must, particularly if you'd like to be seated during pique lunch or dinner hour.  If you're flexible, i.e. supper at 9:45, take a chance and walk in.  Attire:  Business casual. (We were somewhat dressier.)  I witnessed a couple being turned away because of their jeans and tee shirts.  Service:  Spot on.  Our server, Michael, was friendly and helpful.  We never wanted for a thing.  Wine:  If you're a connoisseur, I suspect you'll delight in the wine list.  If you're like me, a person who appreciates a California red, but doesn't want to spend an arm and a leg, your choices are limited.  You can order Shiraz at $12 a glass, or go for a bottle of Rodney Strong Merlot @ $59, which is what we did.  Over-priced, but less money than virtually everything else.  By the way, if you choose to bring your own wine, expect a ludicrous corkage fee of $75 per bottle.  Prix Fixe: The six course tasting menu is $125 per person.  Wine pairing is an additional $79 and if you'd like a souffle, tack on $8 more.  Two things to note: 1) if one person wants the prix fixe, everyone at the table must be in accord and order the same. 2) There is no flexibility in the  menu. Courses are as presented with no choice or substitutions. (Based on reviews of the venison, we decided to order a la carte.)  Our Meals Appetizers:   Of the appetizers, two were particularly good:  the casco bay sea scallops and my cold foie gras which was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  I could have done without the accompanying fig compote or toast points.  (Make your selection from the bread basket instead.)  Salad: My husband and daughter ordered the market green salad, which appeared unremarkable.  Better choice may be what's called the  \"non-traditional\" Caesar salad with warm anchovies, capers and garlic vinaigrette.  Entrees:  Perhaps the best received dish was T's roasted rack of lamb and tomato tart.  He thought it impeccable.  My Muscovy duck breast was good, but not as tasty as duck I recently had in Atlanta. My daughter enjoyed her filet mignon, but again, there was nothing extraordinary about it.  You'll find that meats are high quality,  and cooked to perfection.  If you want it rare, you'll get it rare.  Dessert:  Curious about the \"acclaimed\" souffles, we ordered two.  (Note that the order must go in, early on.)  None of us were bowled over.  The chocolate souffle was ordinary, the caramel somewhat better.   Perhaps this is petty, but coffee at $7 per person seems excessive.....  In Summation: I vacillate between three and four stars.  We spent $500 for dinner that was indeed good, but hardly stand-out.  I'm happy for the experience ; the view of the fountains, as everyone points out, can't be beat.  Am I glad we came?  Sure!  Will we return?  Nope.",

We were seated at a corner table by the window that overlooked the strip and Bellagio fountains, so the view was amazing! My wife started with the Creamy French Onion soup. If it wasn't a high end restaurant, she may have licked the bottom of the bowl, she loved it that much! We both ordered the New York Strip, hers medium rare and mine medium well. Both were cooked to perfection and were tender and juicy. The fingerling potatoes were great as well. A glass of wine for her and mixed cocktail for me made it a perfect lunch choice. Looking forward to possibly trying a night time dinner and checking out the ambiance and Bellagio fountains!",

The kitchen is very clean and organized, it was nice to watch the chefs working in the kitchen for few minutes. The greeters are very welcoming and that make it extra special. Overall food was great, service was a little slow and not well organized. I opted for the wine and food lunch menu during restaurant week and, the wine was not served at the right time. You start the meal with a nice cucumber mint pallet cleanser, then I had a warm white and green asparagus salad. The asparagus was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Main course was a steak roulade and potato brick. The potato brick was made of she string potatoes and cooked very crispy which made it a nice texture to the soft melt in your mouth steak roulade. Steak was cooked perfectly in a traditional French style.  For dessert a strawberry fromage meringue, which was tasty, nothing out of the ordinary for this particular dessert. Overall a great experience and the only reason I didn't not give 5 starts is because of the service.",

    "text": "Bonjour, vous allez adorer la vue!  If your looking for romance or one of the best views on the strip, you can't go passed the Eiffel Tower Restaurant. Located in one of the most obvious places in Las Vegas Paris Hotel & Casino.  Attire: Business casual would be the minimum I would recommend when dining here. When 90% of restaurants in Las Vegas are casual, Eiffel Tower has a higher than average standard.  Booking: As displayed in the yelp notes, there is two times Lunch & Dinner. You can either book online or by calling. Also don't forget you be required to place a credit card down with your booking.  So just a little run down of a few things.   A) try and grab a table facing the window, depending on the time of year the sun can get in the way till 6 or so but well worth it, the views here are amazing!  B) Service is fantastic, our wait staff were very knowledgable about the menu but also they gave insightful information about other things to do after our dinner either at Paris or other places in the strip.  C) Food here was great and my main dish of Roast Lamb was some of the best I've had in the states, however the appetizer of scallops were a little too fancy or dressed up which minimized the actual scallop.  I recommend Eiffel Tower, it is a little heavier on the wallet but the overall experience is something that is well worth the visit.  Overall: Service: 5-5 Food: 4-5 Drink: 4-5 (full bar) Coming back: Yes",

Being a fine dining restaurant, we should have been informed if the window table wouldn't be available or would it be a longer wait.  We advised them at the time of the reservation that, this is a birthday celebration.   Our service was great.  The food was okay.  We had few appetizers warm foie gras, steak tartar and sweet corn soup.  Then we went for foie gras and King filet mignon and Pork chop for dinner.  We saw a little bit of the Bellagio fountain view.  At this point we didn't care to try dessert anymore.  We just want to leave.  Medium Filet mignon was red.  My birthday girl didn't eat her medium cook filet.  Her complimentary dessert didn't have a candle.  How are you going to give a birthday girl desert without a candle... I guess no birthday wish to be made.   We can go somewhere else.  Overall if you want to see the epic view of Bellagio fountain.  I suggest to dine at Bellagio.  Lago has the best view of the fountain.  Very disappointed.  We frequently dine at the Top of the world which has a better view of the strip.  I can't recommend Eiffel Tower restaurant.  The stars are for overall service which was okay. The server was attentive. That's all I have to say.",

    "text": "Honestly I can't say enough positive things about the incredible dining experience we had here. I made a reservation on open table a couple weeks beforehand because I knew I wanted to come here with my mother while we were visiting Las Vegas. They do ask to hold a credit card to make the reservations which is a good thing to be aware of when making a res.   From the moment we went up the elevators from the Casino Floor everyone was extremely friendly and uber attentive. I have sat at the bar a couple times to have champagne and watch the fountains but this was the first time I have eaten there, we made a lunch reservation. They sat my mother and I at an incredible table overlooking the strip- with a view of the Bellagio Fountain Water Show.   Sebastian our waiter, and a True French transplant, was beyond words. He was attentive, friendly, professional and made us ladies feel like a million bucks. At one point he \"noticed\" I was cold and wrapped a pashmina around my shoulders in the restaurants matching crimson red color. I have been to some very upscale restaurants but I must say Sebastian was definitely one of the most incredible servers I have ever had. He lavished us with just the right amount of attention and even a special dessert!!   The food was delicious, by far our favorite meal we had while in Vegas. We started with cocktails- I had The Painkiller (delicious) and my mother had the Signature Eiffel Tower cocktail- also delightful. To start we shared the French cheese plate, which came with three different cheeses-really really amazing. And then both had the Salmon Paillard- which was fresh and amazing. We finished the meal off with the trio of sorbets which were great but paled in comparison to the delicious special pot de creme, Sebastian gave us as a thank you, holy moly it was heavenly.   Overall this place has the best, food, service and decor I have ever experienced on The Las Vegas Strip...clearly I could go on and on...can't wait to make it a staple. Thanks Eiffel Tower Restaurant!!!!",

When I arrived at the restaurant, I requested to have a window seat and the host told me that I would need to wait 30-45 mins for a window seat and we were promised a view to the Bellagio fountain. Me and my girlfriend came all the way from Hong Kong for the dinner therefore we agreed to wait. After a 45mins wait, we were sent to a table which was the second row and can barely see the fountain (can see the tip of the fountain, I guess). We were really upset and I went to talk to the host. The host attitude was the worst I experienced in my life. She said that we are not going to change your table under any circumstances. She said she never promised a view that can see the fountain and you were offered a window seat already.   I am extremely dissatisfied about my experience here I left the restaurant without eating anything. The manager did offer a table with a view after I was walking out the door (while the host won't agree to in the first place). Worst experience in my life. Unbelievable.",

    "text": "Delicious dinner with a fantastic view.  We went in for dinner before catching or flight back home and did have time to spare, therefore we had to skip appetizer and dessert in the interest of time.  Service was prompt and our server was friendly. When we mentioned we were catching a flight they seemed to step on it and got our food out pretty quickly, and handled the check with remarkable speed.  The overall the meal was very good. My only complaint would be the value proposition, which was an issue for me in many of the restaurants we visited. You pay a lot of money for good or ok food. Some of these places, like the Eiffel, have redeeming qualities that I'm sure are factored into the prices.  The setting is very romantic, red & white decor with mellow music and dim lighting.  NOTE: if there is a party going on at the club the music will reach the restaurant. Some may find that annoying.  We had a window table that offered a fantastic view of the strip. The half circle tables allow guests to sit close together while enjoying the view with no effort. If you're lucky, or if you plan it, you can get a table right across from the Bellagio and get to see the water show while enjoying your dinner. On any other table the view will still be great.  The corn soup was unimpressive. The lamb and the filet mignon were cocked perfectly, and were savory and tender. The side of potatoes au gratin wad good, the mushrooms but so much.  If you have the budget, and are looking for a romantic and impressive venue with good food, the Eiffel is a sure bet.",

    "text": "Took my boyfriend here for his surprise 25th birthday during the last week of September and the service was impeccable. I made reservations for 5:30 PM so that we would be able to watch the sunset during our dinner. Upon arrival, the lady at the front desk checked us in and took us to our table, window seat and facing the strip where we could watch the Bellagio fountain water show.   Beef tartare: Delicious and melt in your mouth goodness. A must order. I ordered the filet mignon with the foie gras on top; buttery deliciousness. You know a steak is cooked well when you don't need any other toppings to go with it. My boyfriend ordered the\"The King\" Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon with truffle sauce upon request. We also ordered a side of asparagus and mashed potatoes to share.  Shared a bottle of 2013 Sangiovese, perfect to compliment our steaks.   Dessert: Nutella souffle, need I say more. (30 minutes for preparation) It was the fluffiest, lightest, most decadent dessert I've ever tasted. I would come back just for that souffle.   Overall, it was a great dining experience. I will definitely be coming back to dine here again when I do come back to Vegas. Thank you for making my boyfriend's 25th a special one.",

I know this sounds a bit strange, but the highlight of the meal might have been the bread and butter... the butter was so creamy, silky and rich with just the right amount of salt.  I enjoyed foie gras for an appetizer, then had a fantastic petite filet cooked just how I like for dinner.  My side was the spinach au gratin... so tasty!  For dessert we shared the chocolate souffle... and they also brought out complimentary petite desserts pistachio cookie, salted chocolate caramel, homemade marshmallow.    I have to say, I made excellent choices because I personally didn't love the escargot (fishy to me but my sister loved) or the Caesar Salad (I prefer a creamy dressing to an oil based, but my friend loved it!)! Definitely too expensive for every night, but made our evening remarkable as this was the preview to an awesome Elton John concert!   A 4:30 pm reservation may sound too geriatric, but we had a leisurely dinner & were able to see both afternoon and evening views of the strip and the Bellagio water shows... and still make our 7:30p concert! What a special evening!",

    "text": "Review #180 - 2016  When I thought about which place to choose as my 500th review, it was pretty easy to narrow down the selection to my most recent trip to Vegas...  I was actually really tired from my flight so I didn't even have a chance to Yelp this place before I showed up for dinner.  My aunt & her son were the ones who decided on this spot so I showed up as a guest, along with my 16-year old niece who is visiting from Laos.  My experience at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant was exquisite from start to finish.  Although, my first impression as I walked toward the elevator to check in was, \"OMG!  I'm so underdressed for this restaurant,\" which honestly rarely happens when I'm in Vegas.  Thank goodness the staffs didn't make me feel uncomfortable that I was in my tank top and super tight jeans...  The hostess walked us over to our table to meet up with our group of six & our waiter came by to ask us what we wanted to drink.  The bread guy came by and showed us a basket of 5 different breads, asking us which one we wanted.  I think I asked for the multi-grain one or something, but I remembered that it was pretty good with their butter.  I ordered the muscovy duck breast and the rack of lamb to share with my niece.  We both thought the rack of lamb was just superb!  It was cooked medium--still with some pink so it was nice and soft.  I've never been too crazy about lamb, but my niece is crazy about lamb and she savored every bite of her meal.  The duck breast was good, but nothing in comparison to the lamb.  My aunt had an order of the prime aged New York steak.  She gave me a slice to taste, and boy, was it delicious!  For dessert, we shared an order of the chocolate plate since we were all super full.  I had a bite of the chocolate souffle and the chocolate ice cream, both were divine.  I'd have to say that I wish I had an order of the chocolate souffle to myself, even though I was stuffed.  Would I come back again?  Most definitely, but the view was almost too beautiful not to have someone special to share it with...",

Then, she discreetly asked if it was an intolerance or preference as it would take longer for the shared sides to be prepared safely.  Thank you so much to our server, Carmen, and the chefs and staff at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant for making gluten free dining so easy and accommodating!",

We were seated in a half-moon booth in front of the windows, and were delighted with the view of the Vegas skyline and the Bellagio fountains.    I'm sorry to say, that's about the only great thing I can say.  As a long-time Vegas traveler, I can assure you the food is just mediocre.  The Beef Wellington came in at $68.00 ala carte, and was barely edible.  Although the color of the meat led me to believe it was the Medium-Rare I'd hoped for, it just didn't have that melt-in-your-mouth tenderness that you expect with a tenderloin.  My other dining companions opted for the chicken, and were also underwhelmed.  The Au Gratin potatoes weren't bad, just blah.  Even the mushrooms lacked that deep flavor that you come to expect from a high end steakhouse.    This place is just a tourist trap- the same money is better spent at Gordon Ramsay's Steak house, also located in Paris.",

I call and the hostess is rude and i ask to speak to a manager regarding this. And she hangs up on me. Then i call back and the manager Jennifer refuses to help square this away. She gives me a different time then what i asked for. And then refuses to to help secure the reservation. I already ordered flowers from them. Hope I'm not charged!!! Hope to hear back from GM regarding the unprofessionalism and simply secure my reservation. It's more than Valentine's Day for us. And i work in restaurants on the strip, and their staff should be more professional. Not a good start. I want my reservation confirmed in writing if i am to go there at this point as i wouldn't want to be shunned away on that night",

    "text": "So the food is not entirely out of this world, but the experience was really cute and fun!  Great place for groups!  They don't usually reserve a specific table, but my friend called and spoke with the manager and arranged a table with the best view of the bellagio fountains and a large booth with additional chairs to accommodate 7 people comfortably.      Honestly, I'm not really sure what the heck we all ordered for our appetizers and sides, but I remember them all being very good.  I do remember my main entree being the new york steak with bone marrow.  it was really good, but i've had much better.   They have a cute engagement package, as one of my friend's proposed to my best friend here :) They offer a photographer, along with a cute miniature eiffel tower they bring out on a dessert table that you can put a ring inside :)  Needless to say, it was a special night for all of us that we will never forget.  If you are looking for a restaurant with a view with pretty good food, choose this place.  If you are looking for a trendy spot with pretty amazing food, choose elsewhere.",

I came by before they were open and the maitre d' and manager were more than accommodating to my requests for a very special evening. I was able to have confidence in the staff to handle my wife's surprise anniversary ring with confidence. The meal was executed expertly. The one thing that I can say that had a slightly negative impact on me was the fact that I said a personal all time high for the amount of money I spent on a single meal for just two people. Spend more money on this one meal then most people spend on food for several months. The reason it doesn't lower the star rating is because I did that to myself. I figured you only have one 10 year anniversary and might as well do it big.",

We were seated by the window and were able to watch the Bellagio water show the entire night. Between meals, they gave us small, but very succulent food too. We also ordered dessert and it was a plateful of different types of chocolate! The bill was only $130 so it wasn't bad at all! Very reasonable price for a dinner for two.   They also offer professional pictures to buy when you first step in. They have a perfect background setting inside the restaurant!",

    "text": "We went here twice on a recent trip to Vegas. The first time was fantastic -- we were early for lunch, had a great view of the Bellagio fountains and the staff was attentive. We had excellent dishes. To my surprise and happiness, they had gluten free cheese poufs instead of a basket of bread. If I could have ordered an entire plate of those, I would!  On account of the nice time we had there at lunch, we popped up there for dessert late on Tuesday night after a fairly disappointing night. We thought that dessert, drinks and the fountain would perk us back up and make a nice end to our trip. Big mistake. We were dressed for where we had originally planned to go, which meant nice jeans and sweaters. I wear semi-religious clothing and that's OBVIOUS when you look at me. Despite the fact that we did not meet their dress code, we were ushered into the elevator (unaware of the dress code, mind you. We are not regulars and it is not posted.) My partner was instantly pulled aside by the hostess and asked what his jacket size was, etc.  I realize they are a nice restaurant and they want a particular reputation. Damn near ten at night on Tuesday, however, is maybe not the time to enforce it, especially as it was not posted, and the downstairs elevator staff did not warn us. I realize we are not swanky. We probably are not their desired clientele,  but given that we stated we just wanted drinks and dessert, they might have stuffed us in a corner and called it good enough? (For the record, we left -- a jacket over a sweater in a restaurant would have been misery.)  Bottom line, they need to post their dress code. And if they insist men wear jackets, then they need to put jackets over girls that are wearing inappropriate outfits too. Otherwise they come across as a badly-disguised meat-market. And maybe, on a weekday night, that's exactly what they are?  I'd still recommend this place for lunch, but I don't think I'll be back because of how badly they handled their own policy.",

    "text": "Eleven guys in Vegas for a bachelor party/weekend.  We entrust one of them to pick a place for our one nice dinner there.  We figure he'd choose a nice steakhouse.  Instead he goes with French... Odd choice but since the bachelor was fine with it we all agreed.  To me, French restaurants present an atmosphere of romance and a classy dining experience.  Not a place where guys can get rowdy, stuff themselves, and down some beer.  We just had to be on our best behavior.  Despite my reservations, I had a wonderful dining experience.  Our menu was laid out in front of us.  I believe it was a pre-fixed menu or perhaps my friend chose the courses.    We started with White Almond Dusted Sea Scallops, Potato Galette, and Tarragon.  Scrumptious.  Up next, Romaine Lettuce and Poppy Seed Tuile.  ::chomp::chomp::  Done.  My buddy Andy sitting next to me doesn't eat veggies.  \"Hand it over buddy!\" Our main course - Surf and Turf - Beef Tenderloin w/ Lump Crab Crust.   Highly recommended.  We paired our meal with a 1.5 L bottle of Zinfandel.  Lastly, the Creme Brulee was just okay.  A bit too sweet even for a sweet tooth like myself.   Portions were bigger than what I expected for a French restaurant.  Service was excellent.  Our server was attentive and patient.  I hadn't even paid attention to the view.  I was too busy eating and jib jabbering.  HOWEVER, my friends and I nearly had a coronary when the bill arrived.  The breakdown came out to $170 per person...  OUCH.",

Well honestly, I'd ask to not be packed in like sardines and a somewhat less noisy environment considering the pricey-ness of restaurant.   I loved that there is a dress code in this restaurant. I loved the menu choices. I thought the service was outstanding. I loved the view from our window seats as we watched the fountain show at the Bellagio below and enjoyed the Vegas strip. The food was perfection. The chocolate souffle was absolutely to die for! With all of this perfection going on, I truly feel silly even mentioning the negatives, but for me, the experience really has to be impeccable to give that 5 star rating. We were packed in so tight that my husband and I almost had to look at each other sideways to enjoy each other's company. And because we are packed in like sardines, the noise level is far more than what it should be for a more upscale type of place.   That having been said, I can't wait to go back and see if perhaps I can give it a 5 star rating next time!",

    "text": "The Eiffel Tower is where you should have your next special, romantic celebration while in Vegas.  I reserved a table for my wife and I to celebrate her big 30.  I initially reserved us a table at 9:45pm (it was late since we flew from Seattle that evening).  However, due to traffic and some delays, I called the Eiffel Tower to push back the time to 10:15pm and they graciously accommodated my request despite their busy night.  At first I wasn't sure how to get there, but the friendly valets at the Paris Las Vegas happily showed us the way.  You get there through a private elevator in the middle of the casino.  The ride up the glass elevator was a perfect start to the experience, which takes us to the kitchen where you can see the busy chefs working on the meals.  We were seated by the window with a great view of the iconic Bellagio Fountains, which made the experience very romantic, with its water show coming up every 15 minutes.  We had a couple of glasses of wine --- they have a great selection.  The bread was awesome too (good bread usually means everything else is good!).  I ordered the new york steak with bone marrow and cab reduction and thoroughly enjoyed it!  My wife ordered their \"surf and turf\" offering --- prime beef strip loin with butter poached lobster.  Amazing dish.  In a city filled excesses of buffets and the like, a nice sit down dinner with perfectly sized portions is like an oasis in the desert.  We had very good service, probably because we were served by the restaurant captain, Ron Gonzales.  His service, attention and graciousness scores five stars itself.  He took lots and lots of photos of us, even suggesting that we call him when the fountains start dancing to capture a perfect shot.  He was very quick and offered wonderful suggestions, such as the chocolate souffle which is a must try.  To top it all, Ron served my wife with a complimentary chocolate pudding with a big \"happy birthday\" written in chocolate.  The pudding was decadent!  Make sure you call the restaurant and advise them of what you want to do, like birthday celebrations (I hear they do proposals too).  They will work with you on your requests/demands.  Overall a great experience!  Will come back again definitely!",

Once the elevator doors open into the restaurant you are greeted with a look into the kitchen and all the chefs in their crisp white jackets and chef hats scrambling around to get everything perfect. Instantly we felt like their number one guest because we were quickly seated at our table with not a minute of wait. There isn't a bad seat in the house, we were a party of 5 so we had a nice big table in the middle. Dinner couples of 2 get the best seats in the house right up to the window with a spectacular view. If you're lucky you'll even get to see the Bellagio water show!   We shared the Beef Carpaccio for an appetizer. DELICIOUS. We gobbled up two plates of that within minutes! They then surprised us with a complimentary little shot glass full of carrot soup which was to die for. The perfect amount to keep our taste buds entertained before the main course. I had the Steak with bernaise sauce, medium well cooked to perfection, and the sauce (which came on the side) was tasty too. I cleaned my plate! Make sure to do the a la cart options as well. Their potatoes au gratin is literally the best i've ever tried in my life. (Sorry mom)   Service was excellent. View was great. Food= amazing!!! I definitely want to go back next time i'm in Vegas and highly recommend it. Great for groups or a romantic dinner date!   I just wish they didn't charge an extra 15$ to go to the top of the tower, especially after we just spent a chunk of change on dinner. :(",

The price reflects a better cut like prime and not grizzle that is served for a NY. My replacement was filet again not soft or mouth watering though sauces are good.The lamb is butter, meaning good.  Soup okay thought the Caesar sale just not the finest, a real dressing has eggs but some lemon is recommended to bring the flavor up. Do not drink the house bubbles as this wine will be felt  the next day. Wine list is amazing but more tha double retail. The deserts are a masterpiece and some ideas to ad it a raspberry sauce not on the menu. Coffe is French and all visuals great. Eat light and be happy. Cost about $75-100 a person.",

    "text": "Eiffel Tower Restaurant would be the epitome of fine dining.  I would recommend making reservations as it can be busy during weekends.  Also, do remember to dress up for this dining occasion.  I've been here twice, and literally every table in the restaurant has a view of Bellagio's water show.  At night, the strip lights really come alive, and you can take it all in while enjoying a bottle of Grgich Hills cabernet sauv.  This is a great place for a romantic dinner, or a friendly get together.  They definitely have enough waitstaff to accomodate both.  The bartender is friendly, so if you have to wait for a table don't hesistate to grab a cocltail.   I had the roasted lamb rack with a side of asparagus.  The lamb was cooked to a perfect medium rare, a deep purple in the center.  It was crusted in pepper and served with some grilled tomatoes.  The lamb had the consitency of cotten candy and melted in my mouth.  The asparagus was cooked perfectly in butter and topped with parmesan cheese bits.  The asparagus rivaled my entree in quality.  I also had the opportunity to try the filet mignon, as well as the veal medallions, and both met or exceeded my standards.  We finished with a choclate souffle, which I must wholeheartedly recommend.    The service exceeded my expectations.  My drinks never dipped below the halfway point.  There was perhaps one waiter for every person in our party.  Our waiter was friendly, funny, and knowledgeable on every item on the menu.  Overall, a great experience.  Although the dinner is very costly, I must recommend it if you love fine dining.    PROTIP:  You must order the souffle at the beginning of the meal because it takes a while for them to prepare it, so let your waiter know.",

    "text": "We had booked our reservations before 5pm. As indicated on the sign next to reservation counter. If we book before 5pm, we would get window seating. Instead we were placed next to entrance where the kitchen staff would enter in and out of. We still had somewhat of a view but only when the waiter had moved out of the way and when the other tables in front of us shifted their heads to the side. You would think that at a fine dining restaurant,  plate settings and napkins would already be there at table prior to our seating. We had a party of 3 and were missing 2 napkins. And they use fake battery operated candles.lame. For the amount of staffing they had,  service was slow. We didn't get any hello or welcome. No such acknowledgement. I don't know if it was because we were the only Asian clients there at the time or if we weren't dressed up enough to be treated as clients.  The scallops and escargot for appetizers was good.  Beef wellington was recommended and it was OK. The steak in it was cooked to perfection but the pastry puff on the outside was a bit too thick and slightly soggy. Our server didn't come back until the end to check up on us. By then, I just wanted to get out of there. My stomach was knotting up. My husband and best friend had stomach issues that whole night too. We had to end our night short due to whatever we had consumed there. What a waste of a night in Vegas.  The whole experience was no fine dining. Service wasn't great. Food was just OK until we got sick from it. Never coming back.",

I was amazed that even here, they allow the Vegas slob wear that is so prevalent in Las Vegas. We went here before a show and dressed accordingly for a nice upscale restaurant, and found that over half of the patrons were in slob wear. Certainly takes away from the experience. The service was impeccable, the food was very good, the view was great, the prices were extremely high, as is most of the nice restaurants in the Las Vegas area. For a dinner for two with two glasses of wine with tip was $250. There were several people using some type of dinner promotion here they were limited to a short menu and predetermined items, that was a lot cheaper, so this is one option to consider. We enjoyed our dinner as we were celebrating 40 years of marriage, but we would probably not go back due to the unrealistic pricing. This is by far the most expensive meal that we have ever had for the two of us.",

The food is something you can make at home if you know how to cook.  We went for Valentines and it was hell! We had made reservations for 9:30 and were not seated until like 10:30.  We had a few drinks while we waited at the bar, listening to the bar tender compare it was as romantic as a train station.  We had reserved window seats and were sat as far from the windows as possible.  The food was warm not hot.  There was no dress code??!! There was a mix of people from family with children to guys with street girls ( showing everything)  and a few decent people.",

(i've been to other expensive restaurants and the food was mediocre (definitely not cool)  Service: was great...had a fairly young waiter but definitely attentive...he even conversated with the boyfriend for a bit and took as many pictures of us as we  liked =)  break down of the money  for half a dozen of roses in a vase (ran about $70)  food + drinks ($100)  total was around $200 ...it was once in a while kind of thing but to this day the boyfriend and i remember this date very well...it was a great experience definitely worth it",

A refreshing break from las vegas, we tried the 5 course meal which turned out to be very good except for the veal, I personally didnt like it but the rest of the meal was delicious.  The other four, or five things were delicious.  We were seated by the window, with a view of the bellagio fountain that added a nice touch.  The only low point of the meal was our server this time, he was dry and a little rushed.  didnt take any time explaining the menu, or even bothering to ask why we were there like others do.  It would have made our special ocassion even better.  The first time we went there, we had an older gentleman that was exceptional so I guess it depends who you get.  If service would have been better I would give it 5 stars.",

    "text": "We happened to notice there was going to be Easter Brunch here, and we thought it sounded fun, and the menu looked good so we decided to go.  The view really is amazing.  I would completely recommend going here with parities of two, because you get an amazing view of the strip and the fountains at the Bellagio.  The service was phenomenal.  More than to be expected.    The food was pretty damn good too.  We ordered a bottle of champagne, and they started us with a little amuse bouche of Parmesan flan, which was quite tasty, and some cheese puffs. We both got appetizers, he got the Foie Gras, and I got the Blue Cheese Souffle Pudding.  The Foie Gras was probably better, but I'm a huge fan of blue cheese, and the flavors were subtle.  Here's where the meal gets fun.  His entree was the Omelet Souffle and mine was the Baked Crepes.  The waiter wanted to make sure we weren't in a hurry since the Omelet Souffle takes about twenty minutes to fire after our appetizers.  We were fine with that.  So after our appetizers were finished we waited and waited for our meal and nothing showed up.  Finally he decided to go the restroom and the manager shows up to tell us there was some sort of mistake and our order got lost.  That's fine, we can wait, we really had nothing else going on that day.  So they left to make sure it started and after the bf came back, I suggested he try to get some free drinks out of it while I ran to the restroom.    I came back and there were two glasses of champagne!  The waiter took it upon himself to give us a couple of more glasses.  Rock on!  When the food finally showed up, the manager told us the entire meal was being comped, so enjoy ourselves!  Rock on again!  After all that the meal was free, and very tasty.  We said we might go back sometime for dinner if we're back in Vegas.  I even picked up a copy of the cookbook because the food was good and I wanted to try some of the recipes!",

For example, went with wife and spent 250 tip included for salad,entree and souffle. No drinks except water. Tables are way too close. I could hear next table's conversation even if I tried not to.

    "text": "It was our anniversary and Valentine's Day so we wanted to have a memorable, romantic dinner.  We chose the Eiffel Tower Restaurant with the ads promoting the view of the Belagio fountains and the sunset.  We were greeted by 3 hostesses and were seated immediately.  I had requested a table by the window and expressed that a few times.  However, we were seated at a table not only away from the windows but, with huge steal beam to look at.  I told the hostess we did not want to sit there.  We were seated at a table without a steal beam.  Other than that, the evening was perfect!  There was a prix fix meal which was 3 courses, delicious each one and presented to perfection. The service was impeccable and flowed seamlessly. We both were studying the wine list obviously trying to decide which wine we wanted.  The Somalia apparently saw that and came to the table to help us out.  Very observant..we liked that!   The wine he suggested and brought to us was a perfect pairing with our meal.   I was able to see the fountains go off several times and people that did get to sit next to the windows had no problems with me standing behind them taking a few pictures.  We so enjoyed ourselves and certainly had a memorable and romantic dinner!  We  have now put the Eiffel Tower on the list of restaurants we must return to on future Vegas trips.    There was one other little issue:  my husband's chair had no padding in it anymore.  He was squirming in his seat and finally told me that his chair was like sitting on concrete.  I told him to say something but, he wouldn't.  We looked at the chairs next to us and figured out that they need to be replaced.  They were pretty much showing a lot of wear and tear.  For not the fact that we were seated in front of a steal beam when asked several times to have a table with a view and the worn out chair, I'd give this restaurant 5 stars!  : )",

Maybe it was only us, but there were many things wrong. I have to blame most of my horrible experience on the waiter (who was the oldest man there!). He asked us in the beginning if we wanted their chocolate souffle, and told us that it would take about 30 min-1 hr to make, so he recommended us to order it in the beginning. So, we did. We waited a long time for our main entrees of salmon and filet mignon, but we didn't mind since my boyfriend and I were watching the Bellagio water show almost every 15 min there. I also ordered some scallops that were pretty good for an appetizer. At any rate, a couple behind us arrived 15 min after us, but were served before us. We found out later, as they stopped to eat their food, that they received the wrong order. It was ours, since I overheard them mentioning their sides. It just happened that they ordered the same main entrees as us. The waiter brought it back to the kitchen, and later brought it out (I know it was reheated in the kitchen) and gave it to us! I know this because my dish was overcooked and my side was on my plate! Horrible!   Not only did they get our main entrees wrong, but the dessert didn't come until an hour after our main entree was finished! The waiter kept telling us it would be coming out, and blamed that the oven was broken (when in reality....he FORGOT that we ORDERED IT!).   There was nothing really special about the dishes. I definitely would not go back there again, especially if that waiter is there! I know this restaurant has a long waiting list, but it was not worth the wait in the end.",

    "text": "Excellent but accessible French food can be difficult to find.  The best places are often mired in complex and difficult to decipher menu description and/or ruined by stuffy service.  The more accessible places can easily dumb down the food resulting in bland food covered by thick, heavy sauces.   The Eiffel Tower restaurant strikes a remarkable and enjoyable balance by preparing many traditional french dishes, but explaining them in an enjoyably simple - but not dumbed down - manner and avoiding too many exotic ingredients that would turn off the average diner (escargot are not in every dish...).   As what may be an \"above average\" diner though, the menu, food, service, and atmosphere were all excellent.  It was a special occasion meal for us, being the anniversary of our engagement under the Eiffel Tower (the real one in Paris) while we were on our honeymoon.  My new bride was a little wary of going to an all-French restaurant, but found plenty to choose from.  All our food was excellent, from start to finish.  The sauces were rich and silky, but never heavy and smothering.     Service was excellent, with the entire staff from the elevator operators to the busboys providing elegant, dignified service.  As for atmosphere, it is a dark, classy restaurant with small white linen-covered tables. The view can be amazing - it is right across from the Bellagio hotel and resort and has a front row view of the fountain shows.   Not a cheap place for dinner, but highly recommended for a special occasion event.",

Our waiter was so funny and totally went along with all of our jokes. I looooved this place.   Oh right, so I got the Beef Wellington, it was really delicious, but wayyy too herby. My friend got a Filet Mignon and she was in loooove with it. All the other girls I was with loooved their dishes as well. We all ordered different dishes and it was marvelous...  Duck 2 ways Filet Mignon Beef Wellington (me) and two fish dishes I can't remember right now....but it looked and smelled greatt!!!  At the end we got a souffle and although it wasn't what we were expecting (the quick deflation with the pouring of cream and chocolate) it was still yummmmy.   All in all, great experience and had a GREAT time! =)  Oh and we had a great view of lovely couples in love taking pictures and eating all romantically *insert sarcasm here* -____________-  We were a group of 5 bitter and angry girls...hahahaha  oh, the water show wasn't too bad, but it just isn't the same without the \"Cause I'm proud to be an American, where at least I know I'm freeee\" song.",

The hope is that the food is good, the service excellent, yadda yadda.  And in my book, this place is just okay -- especially considering the prices.  First off, we didn't really make reservations, so they sat us away from the windows facing that way cool Bellagio water show. The date asked about it, and the fancy-pants hostess make some comment that was like \"oh, those seats are for reserved guests.\"   Okay, whatever, you lose a star for not seeing a couple that was willing to pay for the place.  Now I actually thought the walk past the kitchen was cool, because it was SPOTLESS. Not bad. You get back part of a star.  The service was pleasant, but I thought a bit over-frenchified like they were trying too hard to be French without them being French. If you have a French restaurant and you expect people to pay $90 a person, they better speak French. You lose another star, my friend.  The duck was a bit \"tough\", and figuring this was a fancy pants Paris restaurants, you would think that the duck would have been better. The venison was good. The date had a souffle. It was cool how they poured the sauces in, but the souffle wasn't \"top notch.\"  Nice place? Sure, can't beat the view, it you get one of those tables.  Would I go back? No. This is one of those enforced fancy restaurants for the masses -- bring in the celebrity chef to create a menu, and serve high priced average food to people that don't better.",

Reminded me of our tasting extravaganza at Tru in Chicago, only for 1/2 the price.  Make reservations and get there early to ensure the view you want..  We had a view of the Bellagio just at, and after sundown and the water show made a really beautiful backdrop to our wonderful meal.

The lady on the phone said the restaurant was closed. She didn't even offer an apology or any real alternative (She said I could come in for lunch or brunch). She acted like I was the one cancelling the reservation. Horrible customer service and will never go here. Obviously they are only looking to make money and do not care about their customers.",

Once we were seated it took a long time to get drinks, order & bread they offer to everyone.   Only reason giving 4 stars is because the food was good!

    "text": "I was actually quite taken with this restaurant - it has lovely views of the Vegas strip, right in front of the Bellagio fountains, and has tons of tables right up against the glass that made for a really romantic lunch.   My husband and I were actually somewhat frazzled when we arrived. We had come all the way to the strip via the monorail from our hotel and Hash House A Go Go was a mad house at The Linq. We searched several other places and were weary from the crowds when we happened upon the Eiffel Tower Restaurant. The host assured us that the wait was minimal and whisked us off to the elevator. When we got out of the elevator, another host escorted us to their waiting area and offered us a mini sample of their signature cocktail, the Can-Can which was exceptionally nice. We waited under ten minutes and were given a table with a perfect view of the Bellagio Fountains.   The brought a cold cauliflower soup as well as portions of crusty baguette that were excellent, to start.  We ordered coffee, an iced tea, the French BLT Tower, as well as the Paillard of Salmon. Both were very decent portions and eloquently plated. My salmon was very decent, although it did not have the fatty quality that I love about salmon. It appeared to be pounded very thin onto my oval plate, and a salad was precariously stacked to the ride side of it. To the left, was a lemon in cloth. The top had been brushed with a mustard glaze and spices - it was very good, albeit different than I'm used to.   We sat and watched the fountains for a while, and really enjoyed ourselves. The environment was in stark contrast to the hustle and bustle outside, and downstairs. After frantically looking for a restaurant for over an hour along the crazy strip, we were really glad to reclaim our sanity at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant. We'd definitely come here again!",

Salad was very good, but the greens were not very fresh, leaves starting to get sticky. Veal entree was excellent, although the veal was slightly overcooked. The strawberry desert was very good, just a bit melted when I got it.   Service - 2 stars. Drink not refilled at all! I had to ask 3 times to get some bread on my table. At the end of the meal, my neighbors got chocolates after their meal and I didn't. Made me feel like the unfavored stepchild.   View/ambiance - 5 stars. Floor to ceiling windows facing the strip towards the Bellagio, so you can enjoy the dancing fountains while you dine. It's very romantic. The decor is simple but well in line with restaurants in Paris.   They do have free wifi here; bathrooms are very clean; and the open kitchen is very cool to see. This place is definitely a great date spot to impress your lady.",

I really enjoy the ride up the elevator and the friendly VIP greeting prior to getting in the elevator and while exiting into a busy buzzing kitchen with chefs running around in white aprons and hats.  We arrived prior to sunset and we were seated against the window on a half moon table with views of the strip and the Bellagio Fountains.  Our waitress was super friendly, warm and hospitable.    Our drink orders were taken right away. We were offered some recommendations and a menu featuring specialty cocktails was a big help.  I ordered a Lemon Drop Martini which was very good and my husband ordered the Eiffel Tower with infused berry's-which he ordered so I could try and it was a bit tart for me.  The drink almost looks like you could pour it over a bowl of vanilla ice-cream, it was heavy syrupy consistency but it packed a punch.   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eiffel-tower-restaurant-las-vegas?filter_by_userid=True&select=Y5k8bMJLW1S8xBf8L3vxSA&userid=uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ#C0vYkF1CZXXOs_OOEtXE7A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eiff...</a>  We opted for the tasting menu at $125 pp which takes you into about a three-hour experience.  Wine pairings for an additional $79 pp was also an option. The highlights were the scallops-texture flavor mmm cooked to perfection. Foie Gras was very good but needed a bit more sweetness on the plate, the venison was my least favorite-although it was cooked very well the clove or anise spices were too intense which since it's already gamey it was overpowering despite its purpose to enhance.  The starter was a wonderful little shot of cold onion soup-it was creamy and delicious. Dessert was a wonderful delicious chocolate souffle and a plate of sorbet's.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eiffel-tower-restaurant-las-vegas?filter_by_userid=True&select=Y5k8bMJLW1S8xBf8L3vxSA&userid=uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ#-_1Xz5jqO2AvQ5T3gFGnYA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/eiff...</a>  We were debating where to have dinner. Since last year we were at the Bellagio and had a terrible experience I wasn't excited to go back to try one of their restaurants. The Wynn was also a contender but Eiffel Tower won us over simply due to nostalgia and the views.  The last time we were here we had a party of four with us and had a bigger table which offered more elbow room.  I wasn't a big fan of the smaller tables and some of the customers weren't dressed to impress which is always off-putting because the restaurant is plush red velvet and elegant.  I think the price per person was a bit steep for the value.  Overall the service was fabulous.  I do plan on coming back maybe just next time for dessert at the lounge.",

I thought my waiter could've been a little friendlier when I asked questions about the menu, maybe he was emulating the notorious French hospitality.  Food was excellent, we got the creamy onion soup to share for our appetizer.  I got the filet mignon and my wife got the salmon.  The chocolate souffle was very good.",

    "text": "As parents to a toddler, you can imagine our excitement to securing childcare and enjoying this trip! We are visiting Las Vegas and chose this restaurant as our \"fancy restaurant\" to visit on our babymoon.   Although arriving on time, we were seated 20 mins late, then 5-10 mins for the waiter' arrival. This made us feel rushed for the show we had later that evening.  We were seated at a beautiful 2 person table right in front of the fountains. But I later realized it was directly in front of their service bar 1 foot away and took away from the privacy/romantic ambiance to hear or feel service personnel opening/shutting drawers and chit-chatting.  Bread service was cold! Never been to a a fancy restaurant that served cold bread! Not even Cheesecake Factory does this! They have TONS of staff, surprised there is no bread monitor, it's your 1st impression of the food!  Filet & Duck were delicious. Brussels sprouts side dish was flavorless, pick something else.  Lastly, we were offered to review the dessert menu and would have ordinarily ordered something as it was a special occasion, but were in such a rush.   Lastly, I felt a bit down they did not do anything to recognize our special night. Not one chocolate, petite four (that was staring me in the face just inches behind me on the service table!), not a card, nothing. The waiter did acknowledge our special night verbally upon greeting us, so I know they were aware of it, but nothing happened. It would have been nice to leave with a sweet in my mouth after our dinner as I wanted to change the taste of the steak out.  So next time for you special occasion, if you're to pay $70 for a piece of steak, I think there are some more refined, less busy and more attentive options in this big fun city.",

When I arrived the attractive hostess greeted me with the traditional french greeting of \"Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, ce soir.\" While it was a temping offer, I had to regretfully decline. The restaurant has an open kitchen and floorplan. The perimeter is lined with semi-circle tables for parties of 2. It seems like every seat had a great view. I tried the lamb burger, creamy french onion soup, chicken parm, and the apple burrito for dessert.

    "text": "I wanted to find a nice, romantic place for anniversary dinner with my wife and oh my goodness did I find the right one.  From beginning to end dinner at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant was perfect.  It starts with the private elevator from the hotel floor up to the elevated restaurant part way up the replica Eiffel Tower at the Paris hotel.  The elevator doors open up to a great view of the working kitchen and a friendly hostess there to guide us over to check-in.  The view is the first thing you notice as the walls are all windows and overlook the strip and particularly the Bellagio lake / water show.  Particularly for couples, all of the two person tables are right up next to the windows with amazing views.  The layout and settings are all beautiful and classy French steakhouse style.  The service, from beginning to end, was great as well.  The big surprise, for me at least, was that the food was amazing too!  I expected good food amplified by the setting and view, but the food was good enough to stand alone and even justify the hefty prices (at least along the strip).  I had the NY steak, which was one of the best steaks I  have had in a long time including some of the best steakhouses here in Los Angeles, and my wife had the Turbotin (fish) which she raved about as well.  Side dishes, souffle dessert, and wine/drink selections were all great as well.  Bottom line, if you want to splurge and have a really great dinner in a beautiful setting, this is the best place on the strip to do it.",

Their sommelier recommend a wonderful Cabernet from Sheffer, which we truly enjoyed. The steak tartare was amazing!!! One of the best I've ever had! I ordered the beef Wellington which was good, but not the best I've ever had, though I did enjoy it (I'm a Wellington snob, it's my favorite). I have to say the Wellington was cooked perfectly and came out as rare as possible. My girlfriend got the Filet Mignon Rossini style, with the fois gras, which was absolutely amazing and I wish I had ordered it! I highly recommend that dish. We finished the meal with the featured Nutella Suffle, which was cooked to perfection, subtle and delicious!!! Honestly, my compliments to the chefs!  We then capped the meal off with excellent espresso shots, not too bitter, just smooth and enjoyable. I highly recommend this restaurant to people who enjoy French food, it has a wonderful view and amazing atmosphere to boot!",

    "text": "This was a very disappointing experience after I had wanted to visit here for many years. This visit was in July, 2015. My mom, son, and I visited for lunch around 1pm. It was moderately crowded but we got seated promptly. None of the staff smiled at us and they acted very stuck up. We were dressed up and they were still looking down their noses at us as if we were paupers off the street. How did they know whether or not we had thousands in our wallets ready to spend?!!! It took over 20 minutes just to get a server to take our drink order. He was too busy chatting up/schmoozing the large family seated by the window a few feet away from us to even acknowledge our presence. I don't remember his name but he had short blond hair, glasses, and was over 40. He had a very rude attitude and fake French accent. We should have left as this visit was going downhill fast, but we were hungry so ordered lunch anyway which took a long time to receive. My son and I got the onion soup gratinee which we thought would be French onion soup but ended up being a creamy soup very similar to lobster bisque. The food was very good (yet very pricey) but due to the sub-par treatment and service we received the food was not worth this visit. I was shocked at my experience because a few years ago a very friendly concierge gave us a tour of this place and some free, fresh bread from the oven. We had wanted to visit ever since. She would really be as surprised as we were at the crappy treatment we received years later upon our visit! What a disgrace to the Paris in general!",

The salmon was about right - not outstanding, but salmon very rarely is.  Short-ribs were somewhere between good and great (lacked that extra oomph to blow my mind).  The chocolate mousse and ice cream dessert (cannot remember what it was actually called) was outstanding.  Side dishes varied from average (creamed spinach) to perfect (green beans almondine).  They also had a Cote de Nuits Pinot by the glass (+1), which I was very excited about. Fantastic wait staff too.  However, -1 because when we first went in, the host staff tried to put us in the very back of the restaurant looking out into an alley or something; I didn't bother to look long enough to figure it out, but quite frankly that back corner should not even be a part of the dining room in a restaurant of this caliber.  Normally this wouldn't be an issue worth writing about (I understand a restaurant being busy), except there were numerous empty tables in the main dining area.  I don't know why we were shown a clearly inferior table first and were only seated in the main area when we declined and prepared to leave. I chalked it up to miscommunication among the staff or something like that.  So, it was expensive ($100/pp for us) but I left pretty content.",

    "text": "An absolute delight and an affordable treat if you want to indulge in fine dining without breaking the bank. I did a lot of research on French restaurants along the Strip and the price here to do pre-fixe dining is very reasonable considering the quality of food and level of service. Coming here is an experience. As soon as you enter the restaurant via the elevator ride up along the Eiffel Tower, you are transported to a world away from the loud hubbub of the casino floor and smoky smells of Sin City. Dress up in your finest and get ready for a night of elegance and affordable luxury.   As soon as you exit the elevator, there is someone there ready to take your coat and you are welcomed with an open view of the kitchen. It's glaringly bright, clean, and lively with the hustle and bustle of busy chefs running around. Then you step off to the side into the actual restaurant, which has a romantic ambiance with small tables, plush seating, and dim lighting. I made reservations for 5:30pm for 2, which gave us a nice table right in front of the windows for a clear view of the Bellagio fountains. It was spectacular. The tables allow for you to get close to your dining companion, which is perfect for a romantic date or just having an intimate conversation with a friend. We both opted to do the tasting menu for around $120ish per person.   The food was absolutely spectacular. The timing of the dishes was coordinated well so that we could enjoy the food, view, and conversation without feeling rushed. Everything we tasted was delicious and the presentation was beautiful and elegant. My favorites were the venison chop marinated in red wine, crayfish and shellfish soup, and lobster salad. All very memorable. For dessert, I had the classic chocolate souffle which was perfectly done. I also tried the apple dessert and the flavor combination was great. Their menu looks great. There's something to suit every palate.   If you're looking to try some delicious food in Vegas in an elegant restaurant with great views and personalized attention, I highly recommend coming to the Eiffel Tower Restaurant. Thanks for the food memories!",

My side was green beans which were served on a horrible looking tray and my drink was terrible, my hubby and i left with a stomach ache. The only good thing about this place is the view if you sit by the window which we did, that was not worth the over $200. The very next day my hubby and i went to Hugos's restaurant located in the four queens casino on freemont st which is where we should have gone to begin with, what a difference we ate so good and for way less the price and what a service.  McDonalds is better than the eiffel tower restaurant",

    "text": "Took a special person that has not been to Vegas for over 15 years to celebrate his birthday. Wanting to give him a wonderful Vegas dining experience, i sought  assistance in getting a window table at Eiffel Tower with Jennifer, the manager that has been very responsive with yelp reviews. Jennifer gave me an option to book the reservation through opentable. Then, she can make a notation in my reservation to make sure that we get a beautiful table.  We arrived for our 7:45pm reservation right on the dot since we just barely made it to Vegas from our 4 hours drive. The hostess told us that they would have a nice window table for us if we choose to wait 15-20 min. We chose to do so and had two eiffel tower affairs at the bar while waiting. Keith, the bartender was wonderful and even discussed the ingredients in this wonderful drink which I will attempt at home.   Since we were having such a great time at the bar, we were not sure if we were sitting there for more than 15 min. Another hostess came to let us know that a window table was available. We were not rushed at all.. When we were ready, that nice hostess took us to our table with a beautiful view. Lee was helping us with our dinner for the night. He was not Valentino that a lot of reviewers had mentioned but he sure was so thorough with the menu and is an expert with all courses. Lee  had the assistance of another nice gentleman that kept our water glasses poured and tasty bread offered several times.   I already looked at the menus online but gave my companion a chance to look at the menu. I wanted to treat him to a tasting menu with wine pairing which he obliged. I won't go into details of what was on the tasting menu since it's available on the website.   Overall, the food was very good. Have I had better? Yes, but the experience, the service, and the ambience made it wonderful. I normally don't care too much for lamb but this one  was done nicely, juicy and without that gamy taste. For desert, we chose the pistachios soufflet which Lee recommended and a plate full of different kinds of ice creams. By this time, i was too full already so I've only tasted the soufflet and it was quite good, very fluffy and moist.   I should also mention that while waiting for our food to arrive, the photographer came and offered a photo with either the Paris sign or the view of the Bellagio fountain. We chose the fountain but i asked her if it would be possible to take it during the water show. As soon as the water show started, she came back and tried several times to make sure we have a nice background. Kudos to her professionalism.   Overall, we had a nice dinner. Our check came out to be $474.83. While the whole experience/ambience/service is worth it, i can't say the food alone is worth it if it was not the whole experience. Toward the end of the dinner, we saw a lady that went to a table next to us to talk to another couple. I assumed that was Jennifer since the other reviews mentioned that she does stop by. I was hoping that if she did, we will thank her in person for helping us getting a table with a gorgeous view. However, she did not stop by our table so we did not get that chance.   The whole time we were there, the restaurant was full and it was a week night. All the window tables were always occupied. My companion enjoyed his birthday treat and wanted to visit Vegas again soon.",

    "text": "I celebrated my birthday dinner with my boyfriend this year at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant and it was amazing. It was a late Friday night and we were starving. We headed in without a reservation and were seated in just a few minutes.   Yes.. it is a bit pricey, however you get what you pay for. I had the most amazing filet mignon ever! I do understand how the size of the filet is a bit small however, it's well worth it, as it's quality over quantity here. You do have a choice of sides which allows you to try even more of their delicious menu. I do not remember our waiter's name that night (May 11), but the service was impeccable from the moment we walked in. The view of the Bellagio fountains definitely adds to the ambiance of this restaurant. It was definitely money well spent.  My boyfriend and I enjoyed our experience so much, we returned to the restaurant on May 18th. Unfortunately, there was a wait for a table, but we were excited that we could sit at the bar and eat without a wait. Keith/Cory H. served us our food and drinks... and suggested the amazing Eiffel Tower Souffle. We were in heaven after getting both the pistachio and chocolate sauces to mix into our souffle. It is definitely a MUST for anyone visiting this restaurant.",

We were in Vegas celebrating a 40th birthday and I just couldn't decide where to go for dinner on Saturday night but it had to be special whatever it was.  I was searching around on Yelp and found the Eiffel Tower Restaurant.  I noticed quickly that the majority of the reviews were good...but then I noticed the Manager of the restaurant actually commenting on the reviews so that intrigued me a lot.  I contact Jennifer and she responded to me right away and was happy to help me make our dinner a special night for my best friend.   We showed up at 8pm and the place was bustling.  Great atmosphere...You have to take the elevator up into the Eiffel Tower itself and when you arrive you get to walk through the kitchen to get to the main dinning area -- the kitchen was awesome everyone dressed the way you expect a 5 star restaurant to look...it was bright and CLEAN....I was amazed they cooked in there it was so spotless!  Once you round the corner you get to the main dinning room and the bar is immediately to the left, but what really captures your eyes is the view....from everywhere in the place you see floor to ceiling windows and all the lights of Vegas...it was spectacular!!!  Jennifer greeted us and she was awesome.  Took us right to our table with a fantastic view of the Bellagio water fountains.  We were able to watch the water show the entire evening as we dined.  It was so awesome I can't even tell you.  The waiter was the best I had had in a restaurant in I can't even remember.  They were so attentive but not on top of you asking constantly if you needed anything...they were just there and ready to take care of whatever we needed without us thinking about it.  The food was the best.   Jennifer sent over a nice plate of appetizers that were all personalized for each person (meaning we each had our own sample plate)  they were so good I could have licked the plate!!!  We also had a small bowl of a cold cauliflower soup that left me wanting more....the cocktails were mixed well and had just the right amount of flavor to alcohol you would expect.  When the main courses arrived we were in food heaven.  Three of us had beef dishes and one friend had the sea bass...ALL OF THE DISHES were divine.  Lastly we ordered at the top of the meal a chocolate souffle that melted in  your mouths...since it was a special birthday they also sent over a lovely desert just for the birthday girl and some samples of their sorbet.  Again I can't tell you how good it was so you have to go try yourself.   This restaurant was the best experience I have ever had in a 5 star establishment -- they made us feel welcomed and I can't wait to go back.  All four of us have been telling all of our friends!!!  I just hope Jennifer and her staff can handle all the press because I am certain that she will be getting a lot of business and calls from our reviews!!!!",

    "text": "Went here with four other people on a Saturday night. First off, the service was terrible. The lady serving us seemed like she didn't even want to be there and was extremely rude when one of my friends asked about an item on the menu. The bread was served cold. For a little starter they served us cauliflower mousse. I can't even begin to explain how rancid this smelled. It tasted even worse. It tasted extremely metallic and as one of my friends described, it tasted \"like an old sweat sock\". I decided to order the chicken with vegetables and a parsnip puree and the green beans as an \"accompaniment\" (really pretentious way of saying a side). When the food came it was severely undercooked. Even though the plating was nice, the chicken was bright pink. The green beans were okay but had a really sour after taste. After we all finished eating and the $500 bill was paid off (we didn't order any drinks if you're wondering) we went back to our hotel. I started feeling really bad after eating here and so did two other people I went with. One of them starting throwing up and the other one got the runs while I was in bed with a bad stomachache. We ended up staying in the rest of the night, ordering Chinese delivery to the hotel room, and swearing off this place forever!",

Construction is going on between the Bellagio and Monte Carlo, and so cranes are also in the picture.  The service is IMPECCABLE. Everything was on perfect cue. We did not have to verbalize additional requests. With subtle eye contact and body language, the waiter decanted additional wine and flawlessly poured the wine in the polished wine glasses. He removed the plates in a timely and quiet manner. The highlight was the complimentary dessert tray. My favorite was the grape jelly coated in sugar crystals.  Oh, the food? It was alright. The foie gras slice was a fairly generous amount. In its rarity, I had farm-raised sturgeon, which I thought could have been warmer than lukewarm.  What really ticked me off was the bathroom attendant who twisted my and my friends' arms for $5 gratuity for a mere three individually wrapped lifesaver breath mints. Turn off.",

The bus boy was always standing on the side and helped orchestrate the delivery of our food and refills.  The server was nice and professional. The ambiance is fantastic as it is intimate ... until a family with kids were seated behind us but they weren't rowdy. :) The best part was seated right by the window with a perfect view of the Bellagio fountain.  The food was fabulous and well presented. This is what we ordered: - cheese bread with an orange pepper flan; it's used as a spread for the cheese bread; wonderful! We each had our own little tiny cup. - Cold Foie Gras Torchon, Duck Prosciutto, Fig Compote (foie gras was perfect and not salty and who would have thought the Fig compote complemented the foie gras perfectly. It was a rich slightly salty and sweet tangy taste) - Crab Toast a la Francais, Sauce Remoulade (excellent but very rich and crab tasted fresh none of your ... artificial crab) - Aged Parmesan Crusted Chicken, Potato Gratin, Vegetables (rich but flavorful - ordered a cocktail and a orange creme drink  Total: $87  They even gave my girlfriend a happy birthday chocolate mousse. I would definitely go back.",

This restaurant is an expensive, nice restaurant but it is soooooo worth it!!!!!!  I even loved it more than restaurants in Paris.  The chef's really put their every effort into the food.  The vegetarian dish is not that great, that is the only dish that I didn't care for.  You have an amazing view of the water show at the Bellagio.  The ambiance is perfect.

The hostess was very nice and gave us a table near the corner of the restaurant with a wonderful view of the Bellagio water show that came on every 15 minutes. It was beauutiful!   The wait was only about 10 minutes for them to clear the table so we sat at the bar and ordered their house Cabernet. Not bad.  It was a very romantic and fun experience. The food was pretty good too! I can't remember exactly what we ordered. I remember the Fillet was pretty good. Their bread is good. And the dessert, the souffle was pretty amazing too!  It's great for a nice date night! There's a photographer to take a picture of you and you can buy the keepsake with your photo in it.",

The guests are whisked to the restaurant in a glass elevator that takes you to the electric activity of one of the city's top kitchens before being escorted to the dining room, where panoramic views and exquisite cuisine take center stage.  The glittering lights of the Las Vegas Strip appear even more dramatic in the dining room's intimate lighting, and guests are treated to spectacular views of the glorious Bellagio water fountain show across.  Metal framework from the Eiffel Tower dramatically breaks through the restaurant walls and creates a modernized art deco style. The course of the meal is defintely gonna satisfy you with the very, nice desert list.  Highly recommend an experience you'll remember! 2nd Visit: Order their Souffls!!! Regardless if the host tells you they take half hour to prepare for those Chocolate, Grand Marnier, Pistachio, Banana, Raspberry or Benedictine Souffls, order it! You'd love it!!! ^^",

There was almost nowhere to stand. We were lucky enough to find a spot at the bar after a bit, where the bartenders were something to behold. Very skilled and able to keep up with such a hectic pace. The dinner itself was so-so. The foie gras was delicious, the salad was pretty, but nothing special as far as flavor or content. My husband said the lentil soup was good. We both had the tenderloin and found it to be tender and flavorful. The dessert, Chocolate Pear Napoleon, was a major disappointment. We also did not find the wines on the suggested pairings list to be particulary complementary. Overall I think a restaurant of this caliber should overbook to this extreme. They have to be well aware of their capacity and clearly tried, unsuccessfully, to exceed it. We paid an exorbitant price for a mediocre experience.",

    "text": "Food: 3.5/5 Ambiance: 4/5 Services: 4/5 Prices: $$$$ (avg 100/person)  My partner and I were lure into taking the elevator to check out this place while waiting for our table at Mon Ami Gabi for lunch. We decided right away to make reservation for the night's early dinner, first due to the location being just opposite Ceaser's Palace so we can walk over to see Bette after dinner, second, its the view. We arrived 5.30pm for early dinner and its already 20% seated. We were given the window seat of course with the view of Bellagio's Fountain and the Strip.   Again, we went for the easy way - the 5 course Tasting Menu for $89/pax. According to the server, the course usually takes 2 hrs but we only got 1.5 hrs before the show, so, we asked to speed it up and we did... We started with a glass of champagne, then swiftly follow by these courses (as we requested):  Amuse bouche - cant remember what but its something very similar to the parfait from L'Atelier. It was OK  Soup - cream of lettuce, chicken quenelles and lettuce chiffonade. Sound really interesting but its really bland...  Baked halibut, braised veges, tomato confit, pistou bouillon - the simpler but better tasted dish with fresh veges and a good portion of flaky halibut  1pc of roasted rack of lamb - right texture, tender but lack of seasoning and flavor  Desserts - i went for the pistachio souffle as highly recommended by the server with additional $6. Well, its a huge portion and if you are still hungry from the previous courses, then check this out, otherwise, you can go for the creme brulee or other smaller lighter desserts. The cheese plate before the dessert cost additional $10 which we opted out. In addition, the server will come with selection of bonbons if you order coffee.   In conclusion, Eiffel is a place for you to enjoy a romantic evening or just to impress your significant other or even for a small party with friends/co-workers. The food are decent but not as refined and definitely has potential to improve. That being said, if you dont mind forgoing the romantic setting and the view, I suggest to go L'Atelier Joel Robuchon for better food and slightly cheaper 5 course Menu!",

When I was last there, I had the seared foie gras appetizer, filet topped with foie gras (you can tell I was totally jonesing for foie gras that day), and the chocolate souffle for dessert.

I had the Wellington steak which was good but didn't really \"wow\" me, however my gf at the time order their only Vegetarian dish (Baked Herbed Crepe, Artichoke, Walnuts, Slow Roasted Tomato Coulis, Basil Pistou)... and that definitely WOW'd me!   Overall I think i would have ordered their filet instead of the Wellington but beside that everything was top notch!",

For two I then canceled and made it for four I was told there were not tables that would accomendate four in front window Lie! Only to get there and see a nice front table for four. We were seated in a back table could hardly see the water falls in front! We also noticed we were never offered photo other at table or in front windows as others were! My father brought 2 bottles of his favorite winery in napa $75.00 for corkage fee! Per bottle! Not ever! My father bought 3 glasses of wine at near 20.00 per drop Ha! Our bill was near 500.00 for four. Save your money we won't be going back!",

The waiter appeared very frantic, we had a table of 11, but thankfully his assistants were more than qualified to assist. The food came out warm and the ambiance with the Bellagio fountains was excellent. I ordered the French onion soup (gluten free version) and was told two times that the soup didn't contain wheat. After my first bite, I knew the soup had too thick of a consistency. When I asked the head waiter for the third time, he came out from the kitchen and said the soup wasn't gluten free. As someone who suffers from Celiac disease, I am VERY upset with this complete disregard for food intolerances, hence the one star rating. Very big deal for those who have severe symptoms.",

    "text": "We tried this restaurant for the first time on a Friday night.  If you make a reservation, make sure you ask for a window table.  The view of the bellagio fountain at night was phenomenal.  They are a bit strict with reservation.  We had some issues with our hotel check in and we had to call them to move our reservation time from 9:15 to 10 but they told us they would not be able to guarantee a window table.  We tried to rush over the restaurant and made it by 9:45. The manager was kind enough to accommodate us with a window table even though usually they can only hold a reservation for 15 minutes.    Though the service was good,  it wasn't at the caliber that I expected at an upscale French restaurant. Also,  I came to the Eiffel Tower restaurant expected similar quality as the Jules Verne in the real Eiffel Tower in Paris.  The food was good but wasn't special.    For dessert I recommend the souffle. It takes about 30 minutes to make so if you would like to order one,  let your waiter know when you order your entree so they have enough time to make it   For the drink, I went with our waiter recommendation and got \"an Eiffel affair\". It's a mixture of champagne and vodka with mixed real fruits strawberries,  raspberries and blueberries on the bottom.  It was pretty good.    Overall I think it was a good experience.  Nice restaurant, spectacular view, romantic French ambience and good food.  I'd come back again for the view, drinks and desserts  but probably not just for the food .",

Nothing more romantic than a bottle of wine and a water show. The food is out of this world. Must try the bone marrow, filet, and French onion soup. To top off the night you HAVE to order the caramel souffle, it is to die for!!!",

That being said, I was completely blown away by the superb service and the overall experience of this beautiful restaurant. I sat at the bar and ordered a cocktail called \"An Eiffel Affair\". It was a mixture of champagne and vodka, with fresh fruit soaking at the bottom. It was presented beautifully and tasted amazing. I was really cold at the bar, and the bartender heard me state this. He came over and covered me up with a Shaw. I thought that was super sweet, and added a touch of hospitality. For dessert, I ordered a chocolate souffle, which was out of this world. The souffles take extra time, but it is so worth the wait. It was served hot chocolate, drizzled in the middle and warm pudding on the inside.   The view alone was stunning and worth every penny spent at this restaurant. This was my absolute favorite experience and I would fly all the way to Vegas just to spend an hour at this elegant and beautiful restaurant.",

    "text": "Eiffel Tower has been on my list of notable restaurants to visit for the sole reason that its pretty difficult to get to. Its tucked away on this odd level of the Eiffel Tower attraction and one cant help but wonder how is it to sit in there and admire the view while enjoying delicious French cuisine.    Well, i came and conquered...for lunch.   I exited the elevator and as the doors open I noticed I was in the kitchen and expo area. I cant imagine how many people experience complete confusion as the doors open. They should put a sign that simply states \"proceed to your right for eiffel tower restaurant\". I suppose its a gimmick to show guests the kitchen has nothing to hide, but it fails in execution as theres no one there to even greet you and the prep cooks are head down cooking.  I proceed over to the right and theres more confusion as the hostess stand is ALLLLL the way in the middle of the restaurant past the bar. You just keep walking until you see two computers. The host was seating someone and quickly arrived and showed me to my table.   You'll want to avoid the point overlooking the fountains as it is right in front of the service area and they can get loud with silverware,  ringing up checks and just general busy work; it was distracting. Aim for a table away from that corner, but along the window if you care for the view.   For a empty restaurant the service was quick and felt rushed. I received my amuse bouche s well as some French bread (no butter was in sight).  The bread wasnt warm and I've had better at my local grocer.  Two minutes later as I was staring out the window the onion soup arrived. He scooted my amouse buche out the way and stuck the soup in its place. I barely had time to taste it.   The creamy French Onion soup was great, but the portion should be offered as a cup or a bowl. The standard bowl was too much food and becomes too salty. The aged parmesan chicken entree was stellar for $22. The meuniere sauce wasn't needed nor did it add anything to the dish. Ive had meuniere sauce made with lemon and parsley but that was missing in their version.   The server didnt check on me to see if i needed anything while enjoying the entree or bother to ask anything about me or my time in Vegas. I dont even think he provided me a name. He was plesant, but only in the sense that customers are numbers and hes theres to provide food, drinks and deliver a check. Cant fault him if thats how he was trained- to not make a connection with the guest.   He asked if i wanted dessert right after dropping the menu keep in mind its only been 35 minutes since i sat down and i had to take a moment to breath. Service got slow after that point. No dessert and between getting the check and having it rung up it took 15 mins. Classic \"fast at the beginning, slow at the end\" service style. He did bring out comp. small sample sized desserts which was a nice touch, but seemed odd considering the fast pace of the meal. I suppose its in the handbook.   No manager stopped by the table which is always a nice touch for a restaurant of this caliber.  Would I return? Only for special occassions. If then. Service was rushed and not personalized. If you are sold on seeing the Bellagio fountains keep in mind they may not even be running as was the case during my visit.   Rivea, Top of the World, Lago, Spago and even Beer Park for casual diners are all comparable if not better options than this one.",

From the wonderful staff in the Paris that walk you right over to the elevator when you look lost to a nice greeter at the elevator to the lovely staff throughout the restaurant to our server and table crew. Everyone made it a wonderful meal. And the food. Muah!! We chose the Chef's tasting menu to celebrate my birthday and we were not sorry. Worth every penny. Can't say enough about the food. A Devine and heavenly experience. Such flavors. Every way each course was prepared and the texture and flavor combinations. Absolute PERFECTION! Just when you thought something couldn't be topped, the next course arrived. Each course was better than the next. I actually ate one with my eyes closed to savor it more. I can't say enough about the Chef's choices. I wish I lived nearby to come here again and again.  We were seated at the second best window table (Best went to a delightful couple with a proposal. Can't begrudge them that table. Delightful to witness.) and the view was fantastic. Right in the middle of the bustling strip across from the Bellagio so you get to see the famous fountain show among other things. Everyone was super nice to the birthday girl. Chef sent out two extra courses. A tasty cauliflower soup to start and a terrific chocolate mousse to finish. See my pics to see the different courses and descriptions.   When in Vegas, make it a priority to experience the Eiffel Tower restaurant.",

    "text": "Came here for brunch with my bf with reservations to sit with the best view! We were able to sit next to the window where we were able to see the nice view of the strip. We ordered the escargot as an appetizer, and it was pretty good. Though the idea of eating snails might be intimidating to others, you can only really taste the garlic and parsley along with its chewy texture. For our mains, I ordered the boneless farm raised chicken with spinach crepe and the snow peas. The chicken was O.K but it was kinda dry. But I loved the spinach crepe! It was creamy and flavorful. My bf ordered the lobster Benedict and to him it was just a boujee Benedict, nothing too special about it other than the added lobster (they added a good amount). Highly recommend!",

For food I ordered the steak tartare for appetizer, grass fed bison for the entree, and a raspberry souffle for dessert. For souffles, order ahead if you want to try it (they do mention it to you). The steak tartare is tasty since there's Parmesan and truffles on it, and the bison is cooked nicely so that the meat doesn't dry out. This is a great place to go to for occasions (birthdays and thanksgiving). P.S. note that they have thanksgiving specials too!",

    "text": "Officially one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas!  I've always wanted to eat here and finally got my chance during a business trip.  It was lunch so reservations and dress code was a little more lax (after 430, plan to dress up!) but our meal was as fine dining as a lunch can get!  Started off with an amuse bouche - a celery mousseline which was a great way to kick things off!  Wanted to try the French Onion soup - and it was a creamy bisque instead of the standard brothy version - and OMG it was absolutely divine!  The best I've ever had and now I want all my French Onion soups bisque-style.  Just YUM.  Hubby got a plate of French cheeses with honeycomb, pears, herb crackers and pecans.  It was an absolutely beautiful plate!  A fantastic starter, perfect for sharing.  Entree was the California Veggie sandwich with roasted red pepper and I believe Brie cheese.  Had a nice cucumber crunch and excellent flavor all around.  Served with flash fried kale and chips.  Hubby chose the Ocean Seafood Salad - and he absolutely loved it.  Full of shrimp and lobster, with celery, tiny crouton crumbs, olives and a creamy French dressing - he couldn't get enough!  For dessert, we shared a sorbet trio.  Flavors we got were mango, raspberry and sour cream.  Strangely enough, sour cream was our favorite.  Such a unique flavor!  And a great ending to the meal.  I highly recommend this place, for lunch especially.  If you feel like dressing up, dinner, I'm sure, would be spectacular.  We will definitely come back next time we are in Vegas.",

It's a French restaurant with superb service & a view you won't want to leave; we were lucky enough to be seated at THE BEST corner table in there (my birthday dinner).  This ended up being a lovely 2.5 hour dinner.    I really enjoyed the ambiance here- I love a dark & sultry restaurant! I plan on going in the future to just hit the bar- it's that good.   The food is phenomenal- think high end everything.    They offer a palate cleanser snack before your meal, which is nice.   There's a bread guy who comes around with a nice selection of bread; which I appreciated versus leaving the whole basket on the table to stare at me- making we want to eat it all & not leave room for dinner.   Must-haves:   *Beef Wellington- comes with a red wine reduction sauce that makes my mouth water just thinking about it. I don't eat red meat often but when I do....Just order it!   *Souffle for dessert- I'm sure any kind is great but we had the grand marnier & it was delicious. Must order in advance!   *Eiffel Affair champagne cocktail  I went a few days after dinner for lunch & loved it all over- had a delicious seafood salad of some sort.   This place just goes above & beyond- I see many visits in my future!",

All the hostesses and staff were also outstanding. But the food was overall just ok. We did like the appetizer (Alaskan king grab) and desserts, and the cocktails were very good! But our entrees were honestly yuck. I really wanted to love the restaurant for all the reasons stated above, but we ordered the new york strip and filet and they were just terrible. Granted, I am a steak connoisseur and my bar is pretty high (mastros beverly hills, cut, etc.), but our steaks did not look or taste anything like typical USDA prime cuts you expect from am expensive steakhouse. Ive had better steak at Outback. Of course, cooking steak is an art and even the best steakhouses can have a bad day, so maybe it was just a fluke? Anyway, I will probably still go back but I think more for a nightcap with desserts and cocktails.",

    "text": "Amazing!  So, I think that in a classy place like this, one should not take pictures of ones food.  Therefore, the below pictures are only of the view. The Eiffel Tower has been on my Las Vegas bucket list for a while.  In November, I decided to tell hubby exactly what I wanted for both my birthday and anniversary so that I could have exactly what I wanted.  I told him to make this restaurant happen for our anniversary.    We arrived at our appointed time.  However, it was about a 10 minute wait.  I think that was due to our request to have a window seat.  I had already talked myself into thinking that it won't matter.  There are no bad seats in the place.  However, shortly thereafter, we were walked to our table at the window.  We were facing more towards the Cosmo, then dead on to the fountains.  Still, the view was joyous.  Moving on to the food.  Whoohoo!    I started off with butternut squash soup.  It was a production.  They brought me a soup dish with only solid items on the bottom.  Then, woosh, a pitcher of soup was poured on top of it.  If I were less classy, I would have licked the bowl.  As it was, I was fighting to keep myself from wiping it with the freshmade french bread that had been brought shortly before receiving the soup.   Moving on the my main course, I have the rack of lamb.  A bite of the crust will make you cry a little.  It was so delicious.  As I got more full from the creamed spinach side and the potato al graten, I knew I could not finish my lamb.  I offered it to the hubby who was willing to sacrifice for me to not take home a doggie bag.    However, before I gave it to him, I ate off the crust on all sides....He was sad, but still took it.  While we had declined the souffle, however, our super stealthy waiter snuck a dessert menu on our table.  Well, he went to all the trouble, but I was super full, so I guess that I would just have to have a Normandy coffee.  With a yummy cocktail and an alcoholic coffee, I breezed out of the restaurant full and giddy.    Thanks for the amazing night!",

    "text": "There are so many wonderful things to say about the restaurant in the Eiffel tower at the Paris Hotel in Las Vegas. The service makes you feel like royalty. The menu is diverse with beef, chicken, veal, and vegan selections. The food is perfectly proportioned and tastes wonderful. The bartenders are well educated and quick to offer a suggestion if you ask. We had reservations but opted to wait an extra 45 minutes for a table near the glass so we could see the strip and the fountains at the Bellagio. The whole experience is very classy from the moment you walk up to the elevator and ascend to the restaurant. You exit the elevator to walk past the kitchen, seeing the chef and team at their best. This was a nice treat to see how clean the kitchen was and how well organized their system is. The bathroom assistants are very kind as well. Every corner has a special touch and you feel class and sophistication every moment.",

    "text": "Absolutely one of the best restaurants I've been to in LV. From the drinks, food, service, view, elevator up, to even the restroom/powder room, I literally applauded them! Everyone at this establishment was truly amazing. I cannot rave enough. Originally, fiance and I had reservations for 9:45 PM and requested window seating. At 4:30, I received a text for a reservation change for a 9:15 PM for an available window table. I happily accepted. We arrived at the restaurant 15 minutes early and made our way to the bar as we awaited for our table to be ready. Within 10-15 minutes we were seating at a window table over looking the Las Vegas Strips. We had amazing view of the Bellagio fountain. Our waiter was very kind, attentive, funny, & informative. Since it was out first time, we decided to go with menu options that specifically stated being featured in \"The Eiffel Tower Restaurant Cookbook.\"   Roasted Rack of Lamb, Ratatouille Tian, Tarragon Jus - I ordered this plate medium rare, and it was cooked to perfection.   Individual Eiffel Tower Beef Wellington, Sauteed Snap Peas - We were warned that cook time was roughly 30 minutes, and I am so glad we did. It was definitely worth the wait. I can safely say it's generously portioned. My fiance was just about full halfway through.  Olive Oil Mashed Potatoes - Very creamy and complimented both our dishes.  Assorted Seasonal Wild Mushrooms - I could eat spoonfuls alone. If you love mushrooms, you love complimenting this item with your dishes.   Grand Marnier Souffle - Must be ordered ahead of time (upon seating) & it was gone in 60 seconds. Delicious! My mouth is watering just reminiscing of the short time we had.",

I had such a wonderful dining experience that the height and view enhanced the whole evening. Igor was so attentive with a wonderful sense of humor. Each course was beautifully presented such that it was almost too pretty to eat! Our daughter is a picky eater and she ate all of her Queen filet mignon and side vegetables. The wine sauce for her filet suggested to her by Igor was delicious. My crusted salmon was the best I have ever had. The sauces that accompany the entrees are divine. The souffles melt in your mouth and are so delicate. We will definitely be back! Thank you for such a wonderful and memorable dining experience!",

It is pricey but well worth the money! we checked in for my daughter's 21st birthday and were treated like royalty. We had a waiter straight out of France, a sommelier who was the able to pair all of our wines for the evening and some of the greatest chefs! We decided to order the pre-set tasting because we didn't want to order just one item off the menu, we wanted to try it all!  There were 9 items brought to our table....My absolute favorite was the beef topped off with seared foie gras!!  It all just melted in my mouth. For dessert, we all had to try the Nutella souffle.  Wow!  is all I have to say! The whole dining experience was out of this world!  With all the amazing restaurants in Vegas to choose from, the Eiffel Tour Restaurant is at the top of my list!

I recommend going to dinner around 7:00 because once the sun starts to go down the Vegas lights come to life and the Bellagio fountain show is amazing. Ever time we come to Vegas we always go out for a fancy dinner and this place is our number one choice. We get dressed up and enjoy ourselves. The view is jus so amazing and inside the restaurant is very romantic. From the moment you walk in they make you feel so special. I had the Bone-In-Pork chop, my husband had the Alaska wild black cod and we shared the creamed spinach with mushrooms and the classic potato gratin. The food was cooked perfect, it was so delicious. The apple martini was so smooth I had to have another one. Skip the salad and indulge in the most amazing dessert. I had the Grand Mariner Souffle, it was absolutely amazing and I highly recommend it.  We were there over 2 hours and they never rushed us. Most of all the atmosphere is extraordinary.  FYI  if you have a drink before going to the restaurant finish it because you can not take it up stairs.",

    "text": "So if you're gonna do the whole \"Vegas experience,\" you may want to include the Eiffel Tower Restaurant as part of it.   My company held a dinner here in their private room. One pet peeve of the room is the huge column that divides the space, which can create awkward ducking or hitting your head. The private room does not have a great view of the Bellagio fountains, but does have a nice view overall.   There is a minimum you need to spend to reserve the room, not sure of the price, but price per person (sans vin) came to about $100 each, not including tax, tip and all those other extras that can get tacked on.   The prix fixe meal started with:  * Blue Cheese Souffle Pudding w/ Walnut, Pecan, Petite Salade - Interesting. Kind of like Boursin meets Jello. About the size of a small ramekin, it went well with a baguette. Great salad!   * Tuscan Kale Salad w/ Door County Dried Cherries, Quinoa Croutons, Toasted Pecans - Okay, so technically one could call this gluten free! And the kale salad was a nice counterbalance to provide all the antioxidants one needs when in Vegas. Why do we have to know the cherries are from Door County? I don't know. Where is Door County? Again, I don't know. Very fresh salad, the tang of the cherries provided just the right \"bite.\"  * Sauteed Wild Salmon w/ Quinoa Summer Beans, Tomato, First Pressed Olive Oil - This is what I'm talkin' bout! Perfectly done, beautifully prepared salmon that melted in your mouth. Wild salmon can sometimes have a more \"meatier\" taste that farm-raised due to the lower fat content, but this was spectacular.  * Eiffel Tower Classic Creme Brulee - La piece de resistance! Very large serving for a creme brulee - could be easily shared, in my opinion. No one could finish theirs. Loved the caramel decor that graced the top.   All in all, it's a very romantic setting. Taking the elevator up makes you feel...special, for lack of a better word. Would I come again? Mais, oui!",

Tonight I chose Chef Joho's Restaurant at the Eiffel Tower. I was surprised I made the reservations earlier that day and they actually had an opening. I requested a window table overlooking the Bellagio Fountains but when they took us to our table it was that. So I went up to the hosts stand and asked if it were possible to sit by the window. They said it would only be a few minutes and we got the perfect seats in the house it seemed like. For a starter we got the Napoleon of Alaska King Crab and Avocado which was phenomenal, very light and fresh flavors, perfect way to start. The main course I got the beef wellington with snap peas. Very good however I did have Gordon Ramsey's Beef wellington a week before and I have to say that was better but it was still very good. The snap peas made a lovely side. Service though! Seemed like our server was very rushed so we had to ask him quickly for what we needed while we had him before he ran off. At this type of cuisine service should be very friendly and inviting. One time I started to ask him something but it was already too late, he was gone in a flash. But other than that it was an excellent experience.",

It felt like we had out own private restaurant because we weren't able to see anyone.  The food was amazing! You think french and you think small portions. This was not the case. We were stuffed when we left. They kept bringing us more chocolate through out the meal to try. We ordered 2 desserts thinking they would be small. Nope! And they brought us a complimentary dessert.   I would go back for dinner, but I'm afraid it could never live up to the first amazing meal. I would have to go back at lunch just for the views.",

    "text": "I can't even begin to describe how wonderful my experience was at this restaurant. I've been to Paris, and I've been to the top of Eiffel Tower, and although it is not the same spiritual experience I felt in France, it was still wonderful. My bf told me he got the recommendation from a guy he was sharing a poker table with as they were discussing french food. The guy told him he has taken his wife here every year for their anniversary. And let's just say after eating here, I really had to go back and re-evaluate all the 5-star places I've reviewed. I would never take back a star or anything but every venue after this has a standard to meet. lol.  VENUE:  The restaurant is at the top of Paris Hotel and Casino, with amazing ceiling-to-floor windows that allow you to have a view overlooking the strip. We were taken up via elevator and once you first enter you pass the kitchen - all white tile, very French-looking kitchen. A bit tacky I thought at first, but on my way out, I realized how clever they were in doing that (it was probably unintentional but whatever), because as soon as you enter the dining area you are floored. The atmosphere is romantic and intimate. Perfect place in Vegas date night/dinner so make sure you take someone on whom, you find worth spending the money. Go during the evening - after 8 PM when the Bellagio does its fountain shows every 15 minutes you'll enjoy the view. Overall we spend ~$250. Worth every penny...that the bf spent.   FOOD/DRINK: DRINKS: I started off my evening with the house Bordeaux. Now, I'm not a sommelier and I don't think myself a vino or anything, but I thought this red was delicious. The server told me it would be dry, but I didn't find that to be the case at all. When I think of dry I think of Merlots but this was fantastic. The bf got their (the name escapes me) drink with the raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries in it. It was delicious and is served with a spoon so you don't have to worry trying to tilt the glass upward at the end to get the fruit.  APPETIZERS: Roasted Foie Gras, Marinated Grapes, Julienne Crepes: Oh my goodness. For such a tiny portion, it sure packed a punch. It was PHENOMENAL. The pate melted in my mouth and also went well with the bread that served.  Rack of Lamb, served Medium: Oh lawd. Delicious. Tender, juicy meat that literally fell off the bone once you put your fork in it.  Beef Wellington, served Medium Rare: Let me tell you, I've had some pretty darn good beef wellington in my life and this was scrumptious. The beef was also tender and juicy and the pate surrounding it was a great seletion.  DESSERT:  Strawberry Souffle. I can't even. It wasn't super sugary sweet which I loved. The flavors of the strawberry really came out, and eventhough I was STUFFED by the time dessert came out, I didn't feel guilty eating the souffle at all. The texture was marshmellowy but didn't feel heavy at all. It was amazing.  SERVICE: We were orginially sat at a table to the side of the restaurant but wanted a better view of the Bellagio (who wouldn't?) and asked to be moved. The hostess was accomodatnig and understanding and were re-sat in a matter of 5 minutes. Not bad for a 7PM, Saturday night reservation. We sprung for the photo - and although I feel bad for the other yelpers that got blurry ones, ours came out really well. And being a photo whore, the photogapher let me review what she had taken and took a few to make sure I was satisfied. Our server was funny and helpful and courteous. He made sure to ask us about dessert before our entrees came out - which was mindful since we had a 9:30PM show to catch. We took our time and paid with minutes to spare as we walked to the Monte Carlo afterwards.",

No restaurant that charges those prices should ever be in danger of receiving a C. A B rating is unacceptable, let alone a C; I worked at two restaurants, and even As get away with enough. My first review was removed because I posted a brief review letting others know about the rating. I wish someone would have mentioned it in a Yelp review and saved us the trip and the money. Also, we asked for a table near the window and a ten o'clock reservation. We were told that a 9:30 pm reservation would guarantee a table by the window. When we arrivied, there were at least 15 (all but ours and another couple) window tables available from the time we got there until the time we left. I'm not sure if this is to discourage late dining.",

From the moment you enter the elevator to the middle of the faux Eiffel Tower you are treated like princes and princesses.  The staff is very friendly and helpful and our waitress was fantastic. She was very knowledgeable about the menu, honest in her recommendations and did her best to meet some of our more food restrictive diners. Our table had an excellent view of the Bellagio Fountains which made every 15 minutes a treat.  We started with a fennel parfait compliments of the chef.  For an appetizer we shared a seafood treasure chest of lobster, crab leg, oysters, shrimp and a seafood salad.  For an appetizer, a single order of the seafood appetizer will be enough for two to share.  For dinner I enjoyed the beef wellington, light and flaky with an earthy mushroom flavor and beautifully cooked so it cut like butter and melted in your mouth.  We also tried the Rabbit which was surprisingly tasty, flaky but moist. The crab salad was also well presented.  The restaurant was able to accomodate the special requests for a picky eater in our company who has several allergies.  When they couldn't, they were quick to inform her of the reason and other options.  I have to say I was very disappointed in the kids menu.  Although reasonably priced and with crayons and a kids coloring menu, the options were pasta with butter or marinara, grilled cheese and chicken.  I mean this is a beautiful, top food restaurant and you can't get more creative on your kids menu?  So many restaurants sell the kids tastes short but I would have gladly paid an extra couple of dollars for her to be able to add shrimp or chicken to her pasta, or have a fish option.  Other than the kids menu, it was a fantastic dining experience. NOTE: This is one of those places where you pay more for the location and view so the prices will be high.  It is also one of those places where it is worth the price.  NOTE 2: Although I was there with my family, this would be a very romantic date spot.",

They did bring me a jacket to wear for the meal though, since all I had were T-Shirts with me.  The tasting menu was an experience. It was a very formal service, and they were prompt in all of the removal of dishes and service.  You do need to tell them at the start of the meal if you are going to have the souffle, it takes extra time to prepare.  The courses were all good, except for one - the venison. The Huckleberry Jus combined with the other flavors made a really bad clash of tastes in my mouth. The meat was very good and tender, but it was overpowered by the other flavors on the plate.  All in all, a great sampling of other dishes, and superb service.",

    "text": "If I were only rating the view, I would give this restaurant five stars OF COURSE.  You couldn't ask for a better quintessentially Vegas Strip view.  However, for the price, I would've expected better food and better service.  I showed up AN HOUR before my reservation in an attempt to \"call dibs\" on the very best table for two (the website tells you there are no guarantees but best to call ahead, have them notate it on the reservation, and ask the maitre d' when you arrive - I did all three in addition to getting there an hour early) nevertheless, we got a table about midway down and while it was still a nice view, I think my efforts should've earned us a better spot with a more central view of the Bellagio fountains. (I'm a little spastic, sure, but I wanted it to be perfect to celebrate a friend's birthday).  Moving on... at a restaurant like this, you shouldn't have to ask for a dark dinner napkin.  They should see you're wearing black and automatically switch out the white for black.  They should also hand the napkin to you (or lay it in your lap, which is always weird for me) when they're greeting you and running down a list of wines or cocktails or other such initial \"need to knows\" for the evening.  None of that happened.  I had to ask for a dark napkin after the bread guy put bread on top of the white napkin I had not yet moved.  Our server was friendly and made good cocktail recommendations, but the whole experience felt rushed and overly casual (which I would've expected at a Cheesecake Factory but not at a $$$$ restaurant).  She didn't describe any specials or provide any food recommendations.  My friend ordered the chicken - it was tough and a little dry.  I ordered the salmon, which was a little undercooked (medium raaaare).  The haricot vert were SUPER SALTY.  We couldn't eat them. They put what looked like French's fried onions on top, which reminded me of the green bean casserole at Gramma Betsy's house for Thanksgiving.  They did bring a small chocolate mousse with \"happy birthday\" written on the plate in chocolate. That was a nice touch.  But overall, the dining experience was very underwhelming. I think that's one of those places you can go one time, just for a drink and the view, and then never go back.",

Second, they wanted to \"accommodate\" us so they gave us the last reservation for brunch at 3:00 p.m.. Well with all the things happening down at the Paris and on the strip four of our guest were late. At 3:45 the hostess came and told us we had to order immediately or we could not eat, keep in mind that we had order appetizers and drinks. When she did that I felt disrespected because if you gave us the last reservation for brunch then you know what is going on in the hotel and people would be delayed. Then our four guest arrived within five minutes and our waiter took our order. I ordered the Eiffel Tower Burger and it was good the only bad thing about it was it was greasy. I will go back but I think they do better with smaller parties versus 13 people.   I would have given 4 or 5 stars but if you give a party of 13 the last reservation do not nicely force them to leave by offering the dessert menu when people are still eating. We spent over $400.00 and I think they could have worked with us better knowing the type of money we were spending.",

The hostesses, server, and wait staff were all extremely friendly and courteous!    View/Ambiance: 5 stars The view is amazing.  We even got a seat right next to the window directly in front of the Bellagio and a view of the Strip.  You can't beat that!  It's a very romantic place. In fact, one couple beside us got engaged right while we were dining and the one on the other side had just gotten engaged earlier that day!  Food:  4 1/2 stars  The food was good, too.  The starter was the fennel mousseline, which was surprisingly interesting and good as we'd both never had a mousseline before.  We both started with the Market Greens salad, which was very good. The dressing was really amazing!  My husband opted for the halibut upon the recommendation of the server.  He enjoyed it so much that I didn't get to taste it.  I went with the filet mignon, which I requested to be cooked medium, although we both thought it was slightly overdone (more like medium-well with only a slight hint of pink in the center).  We also ordered the Asparagus with Brown Butter.  I found this to be only okay.  We each finished with the pistachio souffle, which was perfectly light, fluffy and enjoyable.      Overall, our experience was great. This is an excellent spot for a special occasion or a romantic night out in Vegas.",

We were told though that it was first come, first served, in terms of having the ideal seats by the windows that overlook the fountains of the Bellagio and The Strip. We went for lunch though, so it wasn't too busy. We were seated by the window and were promptly served some sort of puffed rolls, with cheese and herbs infused. They were delicious!  We ordered the onion soup to start and I ordered parmesan chicken and my husband ordered a lamb burger. Our food came and was delicious. The soup was probably my favorite part. We were feeling very full by the end and so declined dessert, but were still given some jellies and chocolate truffle and then were served a small chocolate mousse, on a decorated plate that said Happy Anniversary, which was a total surprise (they had asked when I booked if it was a special occasion, but had said nothing while we were there). Overall the service was great, the food delicious and the view wonderful. It was a great experience!",

    "text": "My friends from Oman were in town and asked me about the Eiffel Tower, so I checked on Yelp of course. The 3 of us went for dinner on 3/12/12 and it was wonderful. OMG it was really really awesome! The sommelier quickly came to recommend a nice red, which was spot on, we had 2 bottles. The selection of breads was delivered with a big smile. Jennifer, the manager, came to welcome us and I mentioned her good job at replying to Yelpers' reviews. We were just so excited to be at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant that night!  Valentino, our waiter, was patient, as we were unsure what to order. He made some suggestions and we quickly decided. I was sure to mention that I'm allergic to shellfish, and it was noted immediately. While our meals were prepared we received some kind of cold soup in a tiny glass, I enjoyed it more than my friends. Then we each received a trio of tiny appetizers, which was unexpected and delicious. For appetizer we ordered:  Cold Foie Gras - rich, smooth and velvety. Pepper Marinated Raw Beef - Beef carpaccio to perfection. Trilogy of Imported Osetra Caviar - with different little toasts/pancakes to serve it on, simply delicious, something I had never had. For main course we ordered: Muscovy Duck Breast - my friend ate it before I could try it, so it must have been great! It certainly looked good! Boneless Organic Rabbit - super tender pieces of breast, the rabbit sausage was a bit salty but sausage generally is, still easy to eat though. Rack of Lamb - a refined combination of flavors and juicy tender lamb. We accompanied these dishes with the Potato Gratin and Creamed Spinach and Mushroom which were great sides to our main meals. We felt too full to do dessert, but somehow a tray of sorbets made it to our table, and it was certainly refreshing! One of my friends had an after dinner liqueur I can't remember which, but it completed his meal. I hope my friends took good care of our servers, cuz I didn't get a chance to look at the bill. It was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. I sure hope I get a chance to come back as there are so many things on the menu I would love to try!",

The Lava cake was dry and overcooked, the chocolate ice cream was nothing special and the mousse was quite sweet",

We got to enjoy the water light show throughout our dinner. It was spectacular! We checked in for our reservation early, soft music in the air, we walked in & it smelled incredible! Since we were early they showed us to our table early and we got started. We were sat by Angel, she was very nice. (I have to mention that all of the hosts were dressed beautifully & all of them were very nice!) Maria, our server, shotly came over & got us started with drinks, explained the menu to us & got the show on the road! The start by brining you soup that cleanses your pallet. Then we started with the seafood platter & they brought over the best fresh bread! My husband ordered the salmon and I ordered the Queen filet mignon we didn't decide to get any sides because we had already ordered so much food. (Keep in mind all of the menu items come ala carte.) Our dinner got to our table and we were both blown away! It was amazing! Cooked to perfection & seasoned perfectly. The flavored were incredible! We get through dinner & I ordered the creme brulee . First Maria came out & wished me a happy birthday & brought a beautiful plate from the chef that said happy birthday along with my creme brulee. They were both so delicious! Lastly Maria brought us over an array of fresh made candies & seriously they were the best candies I've ever had in my life! It was such a beautiful dinner. I couldn't have asked for a better birthday dinner! THANK YOU MARIA! You really made my birthday dinner so special!",

    "text": "I really like this place! My parents and I came here for lunch to check it out and since it was a bit cheaper than dinner.  The staff are super friendly and so willing to help out.  When we rode the elevator up, we were greeted by the kitchen! Haha, how cool, well I think it's cool, okay?   We got there early so we wandered around a bit.  The view was pretty awesome! I loved being able to see Bellagio and Ceasar's Palace on such a beautiful sunny day.  We were seated and our waiter John came to help us out and all.  He was really nice, made some small talk in between bringing our menus, drinks and food to us.  I really liked that.  I would definitely have a waiter who is more social than one who just brings us food.  And we found out we had some stuff in common too!   Anyways...on to the food: I ordered an open faced smoked salmon sandwich. My mom got crab french toast while my dad got an open faced flat iron steak sandwich.  Ah and a lobster bisque and a cucumber lemonade.  Unfortunately, my favorite part of the meal was the amuse bouches.  It was a shitake mushroom custard (? er something similar to one) Gosh it was SO GOOD.  Creamy, light and a lovely earthy deep mushroom flavor.  Then these cheese rolls, I believe there was parmesan inside.  It was crispy on the outside, soft, chewy cheesy on the inside.  There were two kinds, one topped with fresh black pepper and the other with fennel seeds. Yumm!  Sorry this review is getting long, I wonder if anyone reads reviews this long. I enjoyed my entree.  Smoked salmon had a nice flavor and the crispy brioche on the bottom was nice.  And the flavors worked well, The lobster bisque was frothy, light, had almost a seawater and lobster taste to it. I really liked it! The cucumber lemonade was very refreshing.  My mom's crab french toast was alright.  I liked the crab meat inside, but maybe a bit too much egg on the outside.  And my dad's steak was nice, a good medium and had a great flavor.  Phew my fingers are tired, hope you're eyes aren't too tired.  I do recommend checking this place out for lunch if you don't want to spend as much on dinner.",

This place is amazing! You definitely have to make reservations, but it's worth it! The food is heavenly! I went here with my girlfriend (her first real time in vegas, so I had to make sure her first dinner here was memorable!) and we both loved the food! I had the Beef Wellington with mashed potatoes, and she had the Salmon with mashed potatoes. Both dishes were perfect! The souffles were absolutely amazing and are highly recommended! Most of all, the service and atmosphere is extraordinary! You get to see the Bellagio water fountain from your seat, and the service is amazing! It's like they are always there to fill your drink. Hell, they clean your table with a knife! Who the hell does that? Well, these guys do and you definitely feel super human when you eat here! By the way, in case you're wondering how much a typical meal for two would be here...i'd say on average it'd be $150. In my opinion, worth every penny!",

To my brothers, first things first work overtime, deal drugs, win the lotto, do what you have to do to get a lot of paper son cause you'll be needing it if you want to impress your date. 2 dinners, one side, dessert and a drink will cost yo ass a bill if not more. No joke!   The food is great though. Since we took the leap of coming to this boojee ass restaurant I decided to splurge and get myself a $50 steak. What does a $50 steak taste like? Fucking delicious, atleast that's what I keep telling myself for ordering a $50 steak that came with no sides. But really though it was great even though I only have cheaper restaurant steaks to compare it to. The French waiter was cool at first, he was attentive but then he seemed to care more for a couple of girls and ignored our asses for the rest of the night. That is until it was time to pick up the check and get his tip then he was circling our table like a vulture.  All and all, I try to say \"fuck it\" every once in a while and go all out. Chances are I could get a ticket for making an illegal u-turn or some dumb shit and waste my money on that instead. Now atleast I can say I had a $50 steak and it was de-fucking-licious.  P.S. Dress up if you don't want to get dirty looks from the staff and invest in a souffle (sue-flay), ladies love souffles.",

The rabbit meat was properly stewed and the sweetness of the scallions help avoid the fishy taste of the rabbit meat. This dish definitely worths trying. The appetizer I had was warm foie gras. The foie gras was so good that I wish I have a chance to try the cold foie gras during next visiting. The service was pretty well, but it would be great if they standardize the utensil service.

Food : we choose just a simple salad to start with.  Appreciated the way the bread was presented, wrapped in a napkin on a plate, set up like a bed.  Then we had the Tournedos Rossini that consists of a thick piece of beef topped with a scalloped slice of Foie Gras. Very tasty and delicious. It came with a supposedly creamy spinach dish that end up floating in melted butter. Probably 1000 calories per bite, too bad but really too greasy, we couldn't eat it.   For desert we had the souffle with salted caramel syrup on the side. The texture of the souffle was perfect and very well cooked but to our taste a little too sweet.   So for my this restaurant is a little over priced for the quality of the food but the view is definitely breathtaking!",

Upon our arrival we shared a ride to the 11th floor with a couple wearing jeans and t-shirts, while we were dressed up. This was originally shocking and upsetting.   Our seats, near the window was wonderful! As we sat down though, my husband was greeted with the lady at a table next to us charging her iPhone. Literally plugged in by my husbands feet. The down side to our table was we were near the waiters stand and heard personal conversations among them all night. Our service from the beginning was lacking. I was not impressed with the atmosphere.  We thought perhaps all the ups and downs maybe it's worth it for the food, wrong. The prices are so \"high class,\" for a \"low class\" experience and terrible customer service. I ordered a New York steak. Not the best I've ever had, okay size but not filling. Our sides potatos au gratin and mushrooms were good, but not out of this world for their high price tag. Lastly my husband ordered a rack of lamb for $59. The plate came out with a mere three lamb legs. I can get way more and better tasting at other restaurants in Vegas for the same price and better atmosphere. Disappointed doesn't even cover our experience. We came here excited to share our first anniversary and discuss our last year, but we're faced with a lacking experience. We're upset we didn't go to a restaurant we know we love that our dressy appearance would have been more welcomed and appreciated.  Overall, I would not recommend this experience to any of my friends and family. I was disappointed none-the-less. The best part of dinner was my company, my husband.",

    "text": "I had been looking forward to dining here for quite some time; however, I am pretty disappointed in our overall experience. Even after making reservations ahead of time, we still had to wait a while for our table. Considering that we came on a busy Saturday night, the initial wait was not the issue. I was initially disappointed in the fact that we were given a table that was somewhat tucked away without a direct view of the fountains. Our waitress was not very friendly and took quite a long time to bring our drinks. In fact, our drinks didn't come until our appetizers had arrived. We ordered the non-traditional Caesar salad and the asparagus soup. Although we were more than happy with the amazing flavor of the salad, the soup was lukewarm. I had been looking forward to ordering the Wellington but was underwhelmed with the dish. The sauce that accompanied the entree seemed to lack flavor. The creamed spinach and mushroom side dish was absolutely delicious! Another plus side was how much we enjoyed the cocktails once they arrived. I am giving 3 stars instead of 2 due to the salad, side dish, and tasty cocktails. We've dined with many many restaurants on the strip but I am sad to say that this restaurant did not live up to my expectations.",

Helpful tip: It is much easier to get a window table for Lunch. The only downside is that the Lunch Menu is smaller (but less expensive) than the Dinner Menu and the Bellagio Fountains do not start until the late afternoon. Enjoy!",

The viewing deck is sold separately, so for a large group you are getting an overpriced meal with nothing else included. Services was good though, which is why I gave it 3 stars instead of 2.",

When we made our reservations on the first floor in the Paris casino, they did not tell us that we are not allowed to share a plate. The bottom of their menu states each person has to order their own plate. Drinks are way to expensive and mind you these are just basic alcohol / wine drinks, nothing extraordinary.  I ordered the semi chicken ( came with 2 inch asparagus)..no sides.  $35 chicken was tasteless and hard to chew. I believe the view is there to distract you from how simple and flavorless  the food taste. My husband ordered the king steak $70! No sides just steak. On a good note, the staff was super friendly and highly attentive.",

I also ordered two La Reve l'Orange mocktails (think of a melted orange creamsicle). For my entree, I had the Salmon Paillard, and for dessert, their molten chocolate tart. The service is unbeatable here. All staff members are eager to spend time with each guest, answer any questions, and get to know each personally. And as someone who tries to visit the Tower once a month, that goes a very long way with me. The prices are right on par with this caliber of cuisine, and the views of the Strip and the Bellagio Fountain Shows from the Tower isn't something to miss!",

Next came sea bass.  So salty and no other real flavor. Did not like it at all. Last was veal medallions.  Pure salt.  Like someone dumped a whole bunch of salt on it. First time in my life I sent food back.  You could not eat it.  They brought another and same thing.  For a $145 tasting menu it was not worth it at all.  Do not think I'd ever eat here again.

    "text": "This place was great change of scenery and food that you should expect  from a Vegas high end restaurant. With so many steak house options in Vegas, why not opt for delicious French food with a great view.  Pros:  Service: my waitress was very professional and had a great attitude. She kept checking up on my table to make sure I had everything I needed and that I was satisfied with my food.   Food: starting from the foie gras to the desserts, all the items were decadent.   Plating: the presentation was beautiful and lived up the standards  View: even though I made reservations ahead of time, I was disappointed that I did not get the window seats as I requested in advance. I wasn't too disappointed since every seat in the restaurant still gives you a beautiful view of the Bellagio Hotel and the Bellagio fountains especially if you're dining at night.",

It's honestly been a dream of mine for years to eat at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant when in Vegas but I've never been able to attend, but wow was the wait worth it!  I made a reservation about a week or two in advance for lunch at 11:30am on a Tuesday to celebrate my anniversary with my partner and the few people who helped me over the phone were super nice and respectful. I asked for a window table since I was celebrating a special occasion and the receptionist was able to secure me the best table in the house! The coveted corner table!  The views were absurdly gorgeous! The rose I requested from them was placed on the table and was beautiful. The food was amazing, we had a little cup of leek soup courtesy of the chef which was great, their French Onion Soup was to die for! And at $8 for an appetizer it's such a good find! We ordered the French Buccatini pasta which was one of the best pastas I've ever eaten as well as Chicken Parmesan with potatoes and green vegetables which was equally as delicious. Finally, we were surprised with a Happy Anniversary Chocolate Mousse executed with an amazing presentation!  All in all, a phenomenal experience that was the highlight of my trip and made my anniversary super special to me and my partner. Amazing service, beautiful restaurant and perfect food, and $20 average for a lunch plate is not bad at all! I'll definitely be returning next time I'm in Vegas, and hopefully turn coming here into a new tradition!",

    "text": "This place is a bit fancy and not our usual kind of venue but I wanted something special to celebrate my wife's birthday (was a week previous) on our Vegas weekend splurge. Ambiance and service is what you'd expect for the most part - excellent.  Amazingly we got seated at a window table but we suspect that was maybe a \"faux pas\" on their part as we had not paid for that - a hostess came over to question our reservation name 5 mins after we sat down. Very obsequious waiter (hand clasping etc) came over and did his stuff, then sommelier steered us to a great choice of wine based on what we wanted, food paring and our budget (wine list starts at $65, goes up to infinity, and he talked us into a lower priced wine than we originally were going to order so respect that). We ordered our food and all was good.  Fantastic smoked salmon starter which we shared (red flag for waiter maybe), then main courses came out.  One reason I took my wife here is because she wanted to try Beef Wellington (she's a Gordon Ramsey fan). That came out \"well done\"  and no pink in the middle at all (still very tasty and not dried out but not as any online recipe suggests).  My lamb cutlets were meant to be \"medium\" but were verging on bloody/raw.  Not very impressive! The service from the waiter had gone downhill rapidly and it was hard not to assume he had figured out we were not \"big spenders\" so he would be better off focusing his attention on other higher spending tables.  Hardly saw him after that and the dessert menu was just plopped on the table without any comment as I was looking out of the window while my wife was in the restroom. The overall experience left a sour note and was frankly disappointing.  Sure, a $250 meal for 2 plus a $50 tip is peanuts from the waiter's perspective in an establishment like this but to be so blatantly dismissive was rude and really tarnished the experience I was hoping to give my wife.  Will not be going back.",

    "text": "This review is overdue, but sadly, I was less than impressed with my experience here...and it was my birthday dinner! During a trip to Vegas, we decided to enjoy a nice dinner out at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant and actually planned ahead so we made a reservation before we got into town. We called the restaurant, requested a nice window seat and told them it was my birthday. Knowing this is a very expensive restaurant, we expected to have the same experience we've had at other expensive restaurants (in Vegas among other cities). We expected to be greeted nicely and for our reservation to be treated with some dignity. When we showed up for our restaurant, we immediately realized that this restaurant is more of a spectacle than the other fine dining options in the area. They let anyone up into the restaurant so it's very congested by the bar, loud and anything but \"special.\" We gave our name for our reservation and the hostess lead us to our table. As I mentioned, we had made our reservations several weeks in advance and asked for a window table.   They gave us a \"window\" table but that ended up being right next to a huge poll on the opposite side of the restaurant that didn't overlook the Bellagio fountains but instead the run down Bally's pool that was under construction. It was also the smallest table in the entire restaurant. Our lovely romantic dinner on my birthday was turning into a disaster very fast. We decided to ask the hostess if there was any other table available and they said possibly. So we went to the bar to have a drink and waited for another table. About 20 minutes later they took us to another table. This time, it did have a view of the fountain but it was also right in front of the server's station so we constantly had servers on our laps during the meal. After the cluster of getting a table, I barely remember the food and while we still had a good time because we were together, we won't be visiting the Eiffel Tower Restaurant again for a fine dining experience in Vegas. There are so many other places with just as good of a view, better ambiance and much, much better service!",

The restaurant: The view of the strips, especially the Bellagio fountain, from this restaurant was beautiful. The decor was elegant.  The food:  I ordered Aged-Parmesan Crusted Chicken, Triple Chocolate cake and Mudslide (Mudslide was not on the menu, by the way). They gave free mushroom flan and Parmesan cheese puffs as starters. All of them were very rich in taste. Very delicious. The flan, cheese puffs, chicken and string beans were well-seasoned. The cake was smooth and delicious. The Mudslide was great as well.  The service: The waiter, who took my order, was attentive, nice and polite.  He knew the menu well. He's such a professional waiter.  The restroom: Very clean. Elegant decor as well.  The kitchen: Wow, it looked really clean. No wonder they are not afraid to show their kitchen to the customers. The kitchen is located right at the entrance (in front of the elevator), and it's an open kitchen, so people can see the kitchen and the hard-working chefs when they enter and leave the restaurant.  I will come back to eat here again when I visit Vegas next time.",

We had a magical view overlooking the Bellagio fountains with the pretty--if Disneyesque--architecture of the Italian style buildings around the Bellagio lake.  In fact, even the restaurant itself felt like a Disneyworld restaurant.  I'm not sure this would be my restaurant of choice (given the expense) if I were taking my wife.  I would take her to an equally expensive but more gastronomic choice in Vegas.  But, given that I had my 13 year old daughter, the choice couldn't have been better.  The food is pretty good but you can tell this isn't a chef of supreme talent.  My daughter's halibut was excellent.  My veal was a little tough and a tad over-cooked.  In other words, the food is perfectly fine but don't expect Eric Ripert from Le Bernardin or Thomas Keller from the French Laundry.  I wouldn't even put the food in a category of Mortons or Ruth Chris.  It's a half a step below these.  But, the view, the fun of riding the elevator and the overall experience made this a wonderful evening with my daughter who has raved about the restaurant.  Here's what to expect for price (assuming appetizer, main and dessert) per person:  $75 food $50 wine $10 tax $25 tip  $150/per person",

The food was bad, especially the lamb burger that I ordered for lunch . The meat was too salty. The taste of lamb was non-existent. I would prefer to spend $16 for a fast-food McDonald's burger than eating that lamb burger again.  My wife ordered a BLT burger with salad on the side. Now why would you name it \"burger\" without any meat? The meatiest thing I could see was the \"prepackaged\" bacon which barely have any taste except, again, salt. And the salad... there were still dirt or spoiled leaves left. Totally unappealing. My wife lost her appetite after a single bite. We sat there waited and waited for over half an hour (not touching the food) for the waiter to show up (yeah right about good service) and guess who showed up!? The buzzer! Yup. And his job was just to clean up and fill up drinks. We then pointed at the spoiled salad and asked for the server. Yet no server came. Come to think of it, no one came to ask how we were doing with our meal the whole time we were eating there.   So, after the buzzer cleaned up the table, guess what, they dared to bring out the bill... without even asking if we wanted desert. Wow, my wife and I sat there in disbelief for a while. THEN the waiter appeared with 4 pieces of candies. Complimentary? Was that our desert? We would prefer a simple apology (which we never receive).  Terrible place to eat. Period. Just come for the view.  Pro tip: You can get the \"better\" view if you pay for the Eiffel Tower elevator ride, and a better meal if you bring along a to-go McDonald, and it definitely costs less than wasting time eating in this \"restaurant.\"",

They will ruin your night , spend your money somewhere where they will appreciate you!  I never have time to write reviews but I had to warn others about this horrible place :/  I've been too many restaurants in my day ,, and I never seen staff that could care less about their customers ,,, since they are a busy restaurant they don't care if you don't like the service because they can just replace you with someone else who will take your table reservation ,,,I believe a lot of people were lured to this restaurant because their \"view\" but  truth is their view is not great at all , their service is insulting , the food is mediocre , and the atmosphere is nothing special. Fine dinning is priceless but when the place is actually worth it .Spent over $200 at this restaurant , and I have never been so ripped off in my life.  Seriously , spend your money at a more famous restaurant in Vegas ,, now I realize that if celebrities don't frequent a restaurant , it's obvious because the restaurant sucks ! Just how this one did :(",

    "text": "Everyone familiar with Las Vegas most likely thinks of the Eiffel Tower Restaurant as a perfect location for a romantic evening or a beautiful place to have a special experience overlooking the Bellagio Fountains.  I completely agree with this, but I'd like to offer up another reason to visit this fabulous restaurant.  Recently, I had four business associates visit Las Vegas for a convention at Mandalay Bay. It was my job to entertain them during the hours they were free from meetings.  Immediately when they arrived, I scooped them up and brought them to ETR.  They were completely blown away.  We sampled delicious cocktails (The Daisy and Autumn in Paris) and amuse trios in the lounge overlooking the fountains.  Michelle was our server and she was fantastic.  Two managers, Laurent and Ehsan, stopped by to welcome us.  It was a phenomenal experience, and my guests loved it so much that they came back to the restaurant for both lunch and dinner later in the week.  They also went back to the convention telling their fellow associates how wonderful it is.  So - while it's perfect for romance,  also know that in any type of business related situation, when you're looking for a place to wow and impress, be sure to visit the Eiffel Tower Restaurant!",

I made the reservation well in advance a must for any of the nicer restaurants out here, and the only way to get a coveted window seat! I chose to have roses waiting for her at the table, which can be added to the dinner bill, and they were nicely arranged in a glass vase and sitting among a classy place setting. We had a beautiful view of the strip, the Bellagio fountain in particular. After we were served bread and a delightful fresh soup (chilled tomato with watermelon- I was terrified; but it was terrific!) She ordered the Beef Wellington with snap peas, I had the free range chicken with artichokes two ways, and we shared some potatoes gratin. For desert we had the pistachio souffle. All of the food was perfectly prepared and gorgeously plated. The service was fantastic. The restaurant was beautiful and the view was stunning. I had an amazing time. The only caveat would be that it is pricey, but judging from my experience worth every penny!",

The menu is truly pedestrian with no imagination whatsoever.  Prices are targeted for lame high-rollers and we pity the poor punters that take their significant others there for a once-in-a-lifetime celebratory occasions.  My wife & I joined her clients in from out of town with another couple for a birthday dinner.  We opted for wine-by-the-glass, but the list was MBA/CPA optimized for maximum gouging.   The menu was strangely limited, although each category - beef, fish and non-beef - about 6 selections each, was hardly stimulating.  New York Strip, rib eye, rabbit, halibut.  Yawn.  Started off with a vichyssoise that tasted like it came from a can.  The taste of the French bread was terrible!  Local Vietnamese sandwich shops offer fresh French bread with better texture & taste.  Then we waited - for an hour before the mains were served.  The average entre price is $50.  Salads are $12.  With so many fabulous restaurants in greater Las Vegas, we're loath to return.  All the view in the world didn't make the dinner experience any better.  Semi-retired food snob.  He doth protest too much.",

The night view is lovely -you can see the whole Strip.   Only reason I gave this place 4 Stars is because the corkage fee is outrageous-$75!!! Unless you have a very special bottle to open, the corkage is prohibitive.  The wine list is expensive too.   But the food -EXCELLENT! We had the lobster salad, beet salad, the wild Atlantic Cod & John Dorsey.  All were fantastic with beautiful presentation.   In the French tradition the meal ended with a sampling of delicious, varied bite sized deserts.  Delicious!!   I've eaten at the Jules Verne in the \"real\" Eiffel Tower & now here. Both meals were memorable.    Go if you can.",

    "text": "Had lunch here a few weeks ago as an anniversary gift for my parents. It was our first experience here, and what an experience it was!  I made reservations which I quickly realized wasn't necessary when we got there, the place was mostly empty on a Thursday. Unless you are a VIP, lol, only 2-person tables are up against the windows. For larger parties you have to sit more towards the middle of the restaurant. The view isn't bad though, just not as good. But what a view, we even stayed long enough to see the Fountains at Bellagio show.   Our server was extremely friendly and helpful to us. We began lunch with the Cheese Fondue with Poached Egg. This was so delicious!! We regularly have fondue, but have never tried it with an egg. Note: The bread that comes with the fondue was oily/buttery so if you don't want that make sure to ask.   They give you a small cup of soup to start off the meal. I can't recall what it was but it was definitely tasty. They also served us various breads as we awaited our entree. The one I remember most had tons of peppercorns on it, so obviously a little spicy, not my favorite.  I was treating a few others besides my parents and at a place like this sometimes you let your wallet choose your entree. So sadly I went with the Burger. The Burger was fine but not the best on the menu. They will look at you weird if you ask for traditional/american mustard too. What can I say, I don't like that french dijon stuff. My mom was raving about the Sea Food Salad she got!! She told me to make sure and recommend this in my review, lol.   We had a few mimosas to go along with our meal. Not the best I've had, and definitely on the strong side. I think its great OJ that makes a great mimosa not pouring heavily on the champagne, but you won't catch me complaining to much there.  We decided to skip dessert, but as a gesture they brought my parents out a small dessert plate with candies and chocolates on the side for the rest of us. They looked very happy to eat it!  Overall a great experience along with quite possibly the best view of the strip from any restaurant around. Food and service is top notch.  They aren't affiliated with the rewards card used by The Paris Hotel, so sadly you can't collect any rewards points here :(:(:(",

We sat in the special corner window table overlooking the fountains.  It was beautifully decorated and setup upon arrival.

We chose the appetizers of steak tartar and the Caesar salad, the salad was absolutely wonderful, although I am not a steak tartar fan-the member of our party who ordered it said it was absolutely fantastic. Entrees that we chose were the filet mignon, New York strip, and the beef Wellington with the sides of potatoes anna and the olive oil mashed potatoes. The consensus favorite of the table were the New York strip and the beef Wellington, although all food was delicious.

I went to the hostess and asked her if I could get a better table as it was my husbands birthday and it was requested so many times to begin with. I was told, with an attitude, that this was the only table available and that if we wanted a better one we would have to wait an additional 30 -40 mins. The service from the wait staff was amazing but the whole experience was marred because of this.   I have been to better restaurants and I understand when everything goes haywire but, I would think that since this was a special occasion they would afford it the respect that it deserved.

I always enjoy the tasting menu, which is typically $125 per person and the whole table must order it.  It makes for a very relaxing enjoyable evening.  It's a nice place to take a special client or business associate.  Must have the souffle'!  Also, be advised this is part of the \"Lettuce Entertain You\" restaurant group, so if you have their rewards card, be sure to use it.",

I had the duck and my husband had the Beef Wellington and we both shared each.  Both were perfectly cooked to perfection. And yes, the pistachio souffle is incredible and probably one of THE best desserts I have ever had! I highly recommended this restaurant as it is both incredible food, service, and atmosphere. I am equally into my atmosphere as I am my food when dining at these types of locations and this was everything I imagined it to be. It was an incredible experience that I will never forget. It is pricey so expect to open your wallet but I promise it will be worth every bite!!",

My reservation and confirmation I informed them this was for an Anniversary and Birthday. Also the couple with us this was there first trip to Vegas so we wanted a window table so they could see the town. Our table was a booth that looked at the window but you could not see anything worth while except the Bellagio sign. The food was mediocre and prices relevant to high end Vegas places. Portions were somewhat small and some of the dishes good and others just ok.  Come desert I expected something for the occasions I mentioned but nothing as our waiter knew nothing of my requests. My major issue is that there were more \"suits\" in the floor moving around and not once did anyone stop by the table to check on us. A top flight Resteraunt usually has Manger intervention on the floor to insure guest satisfaction. Not here yet many passed our table through the night. All in all my last visit here as I get better treatment and attention at many other places in town.",

We had great seats right at the window overlooking the Bellagio fountain! What a beautiful view!! We had a bottle of Rose, which was good! Our food was good- I took one star away because it wasn't mind blowing, but it was very tasty!!  I had a pasta dish, and my husband had the Parmesan crusted chicken. We had an interesting creme brulee for dessert. Creme brulee is my absolute favorite dessert and this was an interesting twist in flavor and presentation. As for the service- it was amazing!!!  Everyone was super friendly and accommodating! Our server came by to check often, but not in an annoying way! He rocked it! Thanks Jeff S. for a great experience! You made it all the better!",

She checked the ingredients carefully to make sure I am safe. But I was expecting that they can accommodate my allergy more seriously because when I called to make a reservation, they told me that they are able to accommodate the allergy. However, I cannot eat anything on the tasting menu, and 2/3 of their regular menu. According to that, the experience at Chicago Everest is way better than here.  We ordered king crab leg as our appetizer, cheese plate, salmon, and snapper filet. I am satisfied with the food we ordered. Just feel a bit disappointed that the initial order of duck breast and steak and most of the food are not ok for me. Those were pre-made already. For the reputation of the chef, I expected more, that's why I only gave this place 4 star.",

Every person I have brought with me falls in love with the restaurant too.   The view is incredible - the best in Vegas. I love watching the Bellagio fountains and seeing the rest of the strip.   And the menu is divine. I try a new entree every time (go with items that have an Eiffel tower icon by them...you cannot go wrong with those!) but stick with a bottle of champagne and cheese plate for an appetizer. Their mixed drinks are tasty but come with sticker shock - $17 for a tiny cocktail is a bit too ridiculous for me. Ask for a bottle of wine instead!  Their desserts are also a must. My favorite is the creme brulee but each one can hold its own!  If you have time, go up to the top of the tower after your meal. The view is spectacular!",

Again, decent food and  one of the best views on the strip but you definitely pay for it! 3 stars for food quality, less that stellar waiter service, always empty water glass  and price shock. 5 star view for Vegas strip and the fountain show.  Bottom line, once you are in they have you.  You are paying mostly for the view.",

    "text": "Wow, this restaurant did not live up to my expectations at all. I was really disappointed with the food for the price.   On the last night of a recent Vegas trip with just ladies, we wanted to go out with a classy bang. Earlier in the year I visited the Ramsey Steakhouse which is also located in the Paris hotel/casino. That was my first pick but since we couldn't get a table there, Eiffel was our backup plan.   We had a reservation for 4 and arrived about 20 minutes early. They accommodated us right away which was great. The view of the strip is a beautiful backdrop to the restaurant.   Our server was excellent. He was very professional and explained everything in detail.   I ordered the surf and turf ($74). It was a prime cut steak with lobster. I was extremely extremely disappointed with my meal. It was a layered meal which consisted of a block of a bland potato dish, topped with the steak, topped with a lobster cake then topped with 2 tiny pieces of lobster and garnish <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=gYF9-Ev_sqV2gqB4dMs6Lw&userid=Q2RsDOhzsCBI-F1oOPe6Lg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>.  Not at all what I had in mind. I couldn't help but compare this to Gordon Ramsay's. Eiffel Tower restaurant doesn't come close to Ramsay's.   In lieu of a salad, I opted for the tomato, mozzarella and basil app. ($18) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ehCfEscdNE6edLBmFV77oA&userid=Q2RsDOhzsCBI-F1oOPe6Lg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>. That was delish! It is heirloom tomatoes, avocado, with fresh mozzarella cheese dressed with a basil oil. I ate this with assorted bread they give. Speaking of bread, you get it only after you put in your order. There is a man who walks around with a platter of assorted bread table-to-table. Can't they just leave a bread basket, don't want that man to judge me on my bread consumption, ha ha?  The steak was good but nothing mind blowing. Sides were ok. My friends ordered the halibut and only ate about half since she didn't really like the flavor.   I'm glad I can say I've tried this place but probably wouldn't ever come back nor recommend to others.",

Our waiter was excellent ( I hate it when we receive great service and I forget the name ) The food was very good, but equivalent to (not surpass) other steak houses. The steaks were prepared just to our liking though. The Pear Martini was excellent, but at a staggering $20. I don't recall ever paying 20 bucks for a drink regardless of where but it was a unique drink, so worth the cost.   Seeing that it was a B-day celebration, our waiter brought over a dark choc dessert in a shot glass. It was rich, bittersweet and very satisfying for its small size. One of the best I've ever had. Nice touch!   It was a very nice experience, especially watching the beauriful fountains while we enjoyed our meal. The prices were a bit high ($20 drinks) but it's justified once you get a glimpse of the Bellagio fountain.  Well worth the experience.",

Pricey....expect to pay for the location and the view but the food was YUM! Started with a few different types of bread and a bottle of wine. We ordered two main dishes we were both interested in. Main dishes we ordered were the stuffed lobster tails (I ordered but my husband commandeered it after I took his meal!) and I had the lamb chops (OMG the best!!!!). The side orders were nothing to write home about and the husband and I were not up for desert so we opted out of the souffle. Best place for a wonderful and romantic evening night out (although we did see families and friends eating there as well).",

I wanted a memorable dining experience and settled on the Eiffel Tower Restaurant for our celebratory dinner on 1-30-16.  When I made reservations, I asked if we could get a table by the window overlooking the Bellagio fountains. As some other reviewers have mentioned, I too was told that the only way to guarantee a window table was to buy an all-inclusive package.  This is my only nit-pick with the Eiffel Tower Restaurant....the price of the package is insane. Even if it is \"all-inclusive,\" there's just no way that two people will eat/drink enough to justify the price you commit to in order to guarantee a window seat. To put it in perspective, my wife and I ended up getting a 6-course chef's tasting menu, we each had 3 premium wines/drinks, we got a commemorative photo, I had roses delivered to the table, and we got 2 Express tickets to the top of the tower after dinner. Even with all of that, it still didn't add up to the price needed to \"guarantee\" a window.  The good news.....we ended up getting a nice window table anyway. I declined the guarantee price but simply asked if they could do their best. And they came through.  When you take the elevator up, you exit right into the kitchen, which I thought was a cool touch. It's like you immediately enter a different world, where you get to see world-class chefs at work.  The view from the restaurant is amazing. As mentioned, our table was right up against the window looking directly over the fountains.  At the server's suggestion, we opted for the 6-course tasting menu. It was great because we got a taste of everything. The highlights were a warm lobster salad, wild snapper, and venison. The only thing I wished we hadn't done was the cheese tray. It was an optional add-on and, in fairness, our server warned us that it's not popular. I ordered it anyway, and I shouldn't have because it just wasn't our thing.  The service was top notch. Literally the best service I've ever had in a restaurant. Very attentive without being intrusive. I wish I could remember our server's name to give him a shout out because he did a fantastic job.  Don't go here if you're on a budget. If you want a memorable, romantic experience in Vegas, though, this is your place.",

    "text": "It's really too bad that this experience was so disappointing.  Our group of four had dinner here before we headed out to a show.  Two people in our party ordered steaks, medium rare.  Well, they both came out not only well done, but burnt.  It's appalling that the chef thought it was okay to send out steaks that looked like this, and also shocking that the waiter looked at these steaks and didn't seem to care. You'd think he'd say to himself \"hmmm, these look really well done and my customers ordered medium rare.\"  But no... my friends sawed through the steaks and sent them back, but by that time we were running late for our show.  So, canceled our order and left hungry.  They did give us a nice discount on our appetizer and wine, but how hard is it to cook a steak?  How hard is it to observe that you overcooked a steak when you're a chef at a high end restaurant?  The steaks should never have been presented to us.",

The service was truly professional.  They kept the wine flowing and anticipated every need we could have.  The food was incredible.  I got the duck and my husband got whitefish, neither disappointed.

Let me start by saying we were lucky to have a booth facing the Bellagio Music fountain! And we purposely made the reservation for around sunset, the view was breath taking! The food was also amazing! I had the Cod and it was made to perfection! My friends ordered the salmon and the chicken, they were all so juicy and tender! The cod was made with curry sauce which was very interesting! The portion is also perfect to allow us some room for dessert! I personally thought the creme brulee was soooo good! And it just looks amazing with the fan looking thing on top as decoration! And the souffle on the other hand was just okay, we didn't finish it. Highly recommend if you are looking for a highly relaxing and romantic dinner!",

The cold foie gras torchon was recommended over the sauteed New York State foie gras which would have been our initial choice, and we were not disappointed. The fig compote was a perfect complement to the foie gras.   The wine list is heavily tilted towards wines that run from the cost of a decent dinner to the list price of a used Honda Accord. It is not an inexpensive place. We did a drink each and a glass of wine.   The bone-in rib eye was magnificent as was the recommended green peppercorn sauce. My wife enjoyed her steak and my daughter loved her chicken dish.   For me, wife, and daughter, it was about $500+. I would think that this could have been pulled off in Chicago with a more egalitarian wine list and the same quality for $300-$350 (maybe), even with a bottle of wine, so don't come looking for a moderate price point.   Good service, great view, great food, but a bit expensive for what it is. If the cost works for you, give it a try.",

    "text": "Taking into account the service, quality of food, price, and the unparalleled views, I highly recommending coming to the Eiffel Tower Restaurant for a special dinner date.   I brought my bf here for his bday weekend and our first meal off the plane at 10pm was at The Eiffel Tower restaurant. While everybody raves about their views, I think they are seriously underrated for their food. Every single dish that we ordered was amazing. Our waiter was ridiculously attentive without being in your face. The entire restaurant gets gorgeous fountain views at the perfect height. If you make a reservation for 2, they tend to seat you at the window at these cute couple tables where you both sit face next to each other and enjoy the strip view.   We ordered about 6/7 dishes, including a lobster corn chowder with crab flan (huge chunks of juicy lobster scattered throughout a creamy corn chowder, embellished with a chunk of crab flan), foie gras and warm pear appetizer, the beef wellington (huge portions and unlike anything I've had before, good flavor), an amazing veal entree, and 1 dessert + 1 complimentary dessert for his birthday. Everything was stellar... I didn't have EXTREMELY high expectations so me and my taste buds were ever so thrilled all night. Best part was, our two-person birthday dinner with drinks came to $270 total including tax and a generous tip. Very reasonable in my opinion... Keep in mind we ordered enough food for 3-4 normal people. :)   A special night!   It would be really hard for one to have a bad night here. Even if it's just for a drink or dessert, or a snack, it's worth the experience.",

I have a big family, which is great because it means there are more dishes I could try! I feel that this is a great restaurant for people who are visiting Vegas, because the restaurant offers a great view of the strip, as well as, the Bellagio fountain show. But if you are looking for an omg, mouth watery dishes then it's best to try other restaurants from renowned chef around the city. I am very pleased that the seafood platter was cook perfectly.  My duck was a bit bland to me. My brothers got steak (ribeye & filet mignon) and it was ok. My dinning experience was not as great coming from a high-end restaurant. Our server seemed very quick and efficient, which is good for attending to all the customers and getting everyone served. But I like it more when they take their time with you and agreeing with what you order. I felt that she was pushy to get my dad to get a side dish even though it was obvious that he didn't want any. Then when my mom was next to order and she asked my dad if he got any side dishes, the waitress gave an attitude, \"I already asked him, but he didn't want any.\" When we were undecided on whether we should get one or two seafood platter, she announced over the entire table to get everyone's attention to hurriedly decide what we want.  Lastly, we opt to skip the dessert and just asked for the check and she gave a disapproving look. The restaurant was bit pricey for the food and service, but I guess you're paying for the spectacular view.",

When he made the reservation, he requested for a table by the window with the view of the Bellagio fountains. He was told that they can't guarantee that and we'll just have to basically try our luck when we get there. We were so happy to find out that they have reserved a table for us by the corner (closest to the Paris balloon) with the view of the fountains! :) It was nice being in the corner, we had a little bit pf privacy. The setting was so romantic, especially with the view of the sun setting and the Bellagio fountains dancing.  We sat down and started going through the food menu and the wine list. It was so hard picking out the wine since they had a massive list. My husband and I ended up getting 2 different ones. A glass of rose wine for me and a half bottle of red wine for him (can't remember exactly what the varieties were). For our starters, I got the corn soup and my husband got the smoked salmon. We got the muscovy duck and the aged new york steak for our main course. Then we got two souffles to mix and share, as per our server's suggestion. We had the grand marnier and chocolate-- they were to die for! Everything we had turned out to be very, very good!  Also our server, Joshua (I hope I got his name right), was wonderful! Even after devouring our desserts, he even offered us some petit fours. Wish I could take all of their salted caramels! lol They were so good... best I ever had so far.  We were very satisfied with everything and left the restaurant with very happy tummies! We'll definitely go back again in the future! :)",

Well, I finally got to do that during a work trip of my own AND I got to eat at the restaurant. That was definitely one of the highlights of my trip because the food was exquisite (almost said \"amazing\" but I wanted to try a classier word to match with this classy place ;) )!  I made reservations through Open Table and was advised on their strict dress code. Luckily I brought a dress, otherwise my jeans or shorts wouldn't have cut it. So FYI, be prepared for that. As soon as we stepped foot in the elevator to take us up, I was already impressed by the service. Our waiter was so attentive and seated us by the windows so we could get a good view of the Bellagio water show. He also made sure to get our food out quickly because we had to be out of there to make it to a show.   I started with a glass of Riesling and the Blue Cheese Souffle Pudding with Petite Salad. It had a little Eiffel Tower picture on it, which meant it was a favorite...and not only can I see why, but I'm still thinking about how delicious that dish was! The souffle was perfect, not too stiff and not too soft (sorry, that's the best I can do to describe it!). The flavor was not too intense even though blue cheese usually is, so that made it even better!  For my entree, I had Olive Oil Poached Halibut and Herbed Couscous with Tomato Basil. Fish is usually not something I order, but I wanted something light and this was highly recommended. WOWWW. That's all I can say. Try it. You'll love it. Both the fish and the couscous were seasoned just right and I felt like every bite just melted in my mouth.   The portions weren't huge...I mean, it's a fancy restaurant so I was expecting tiny! But they were just right. I would have tried a dessert, but we had to go. I'll do that next time I go back!",

    "text": "The Eiffel Tower Restaurant is a place to come for the amazing atmosphere of eating in the Eiffel Tower overlooking the Las Vegas Strip and not necessarily the food. Me and my three friends made reservations for a Monday night at around 6pm on 2/11/13. When we got up there, you have to take the elevator up to the restaurant, then walk through their kitchen area, which is really neat to see. They gave us a side view of the Bellagio fountains and the rest of the strip (which is an amazing view). It is a very classy place, and they serve you multiple choice of bread which are all excellent. It's a pricy place, but no pricer than your going to get anywhere else on the strip. I got the FIlet Mignon with Bearnaise sauce, which was very good, just not great. Also got the Caesar salad, however, the dressing tasted 100% oil, and not like caesar at all, which was probably my least favorite thing here. Also got a Apple strudel dessert which was very flavorful with cinnamon sugar and nice flaky crust.   PROS *Atmosphere - #1 reason to come here. Might be the nicest place to dine in the heart of the strip. At night it's beautiful because not only do you get a great view of the Bellagio fountains, but the strip in general.   *Service - I really enjoyed how it felt like we didn't have a waiter, but we had a host. Everyone was really nice and very accommodating. The waitress always came over and refilled our water glasses and they constantly asked us if we wanted more of that fresh bread.   CONS *Food - Food is still really good, just nothing amazing to the point I was blown away. I personally think Ruth's Chris or Morton's food is better than here.  *Price - Not outrageous for Las Vegas, but still a pricy place. For a Caesar Salad, Filet Mignon, and a dessert cost me in the neighborhood of $100.",

Absolutely spectacular, a little bite of asparagus-y perfection. My now hubby got the steak sandwich (which was also excellent, I wished I would have ordered the same) I got the crab french toast which was where the meal took a turn for the worst. The bread was stuffed with a very heavy mixture of crab and mayonnaise. The bread was very heavy, greasy and in conjunction with the crab mixture it just wasn't at all what I expected or very palate pleasing.   We ordered dessert which was the apple strudel. It wasn't a BAD dessert but it wasn't what you would expect from a french restaurant with this kind of stellar reputation. Our server was excellent but the experience itself was inconsistent.

Low lighting and a view that can't be beat, fine linens, and wait staff who attend to your every need, the Eiffel Tower is first class all the way.   I selected their smoked salmon to start and I have never had a better piece of fish. Smooth, thinly sliced, and melt in your mouth buttery taste accompanied the onion, capers, and creme fraiche (not sure of my French spelling here) with several slices of perfectly toasted bread. I could have eaten a second plate and called it a meal. The capers were surprisingly delicious - not the over salted from a jar variety.   Most of us selected their filet mignon, with several different toppings to choose from. I couldn't resist and chose the decadent Bernaise sauce. The steak itself was cooked to perfection and the interior was almost as buttery smooth as the sauce itself. There were a ton of sides passed around our table, but the winners were the potatoes gratin (perfect in their simplicity) and the mushroom spatzle (yes they eat German food in parts of France).   Desserts probably deserve their own review, but to put it simply; save room and order a bunch to taste and share. The chocolate plate will leave any chocoholic in heaven.

He made sure we had everything we needed was able to describe the menu items with great detail - helping us throughout the meal.  We tried the Seafood Salad, Crab and Avacado, Parmesan Chicken, and the soup.  The only minimal complaint was that the lettuce was cut too small.  Otherwise, everyone was happy with their choice.    Would definitely visit again!  Can't wait to share with more of our guests",

I would certainly call ahead for reservations.",

    "text": "I attended a networking event here where primarily cocktails and appetizers were offered. I think most of them were made special for us, because I don't really see anything specific to what I tasted on the menu. But I imagine they were alterations of things that they do actually serve.  The view from our section of the restaurant was gorgeous. They're serious about their service level. Someone puts you in an elevator and another person escorts you off of it and to your section. No one can come or go unless permitted by the elevator monitors. There were at least 4 individuals constantly circling the room, offering bites, checking for drink orders, and clearing away used dishes.   My cocktail wasn't great. It was a flavorless Cosmo. But my co-worker got the Berry Champagne. It was pretty delicious, like a Sangria but sparkling.   Now, the appetizers. OMG DELICIOUS. So, so, so delicious. I definitely made a meal out of them. The goat cheese filled dates, mini lamb burgers, and parmesan bread balls (none of these are probably the correct names) were my favorite. My guess is that the actual menu items are even better. Next time I'm in Vegas, I might have to reserve a table and have a real meal.",

Last night I was a far better experience, from a restaurant experience perspective. I requested a window table with a view, and was absolutely elated with our table! It was breathtaking! We overlooked the strip and had an amazing view of the Bellagio water show. The food was the best we've ever had! The best steak and lobster EVER! The Sommelier, Joe was great and helped us select the BEST champagne we have had...and we've been to Champagne, France! I highly recommend dinner here for any occasion! Thank you for helping us have such a memorable first anniversary!",

The salmon was delicious (I wish the portion were larger ^_^). The creme brulee finished off the meal with a sweet kick. -Gorgeous panoramic views of the strip (beautiful fountain view), request a window table if any are available -Friendly, professional service  Cons:-One of the busiest restaurants on the strip, restaurant feels very crowded -food and drinks are a bit over priced (but then again it is a restaurant on the strip) -portions are small, but it is intended to be a multi course dinner -can be a bit loud -the booths still have a beautiful view of the strip, but the coveted tables are right on the window -the woman checking us in was a bit stuck up, I had to greet her first =(  Overall, it was a good experience. But as far as I am concerned, this was a one time deal.",

I made a reservation for early dinner (5:30pm) because I want to have a table facing the Bellagio fountain. I was not disappointed. We were given the corner table by the window, the very best seat in the entire restaurant!  The food was great from start to finish. I had the fois gras for appetizer and loved every bite of it. The lamb chop for my main entree was cooked exactly the way I wanted. All that great food was finished with the delicious chocolate souffle, on a plate with \"Happy Anniversary\" writen in chocolate sauce.  The service is absolutely perfect. Our waiter was very attentive without being overly so. The entire dinner lasted 3 hours and was perfectly paced. The view is definitely one of the best in Vegas, we saw the fountain at sunset, and at night with lights on; I only wish that I could hear the music when the fountain came to life every 20 minutes.  I have recommended this place to many of my friends, and came back here again earlier this year during a girls weekend. We got a great seats overlooking the fountain, and the food and service were just as memorable as the first time!   I will definitely come back again!",

The waiter then tried to sell us some kind of restaurant membership, which was tacky. My filet mignon was just ok. It wasn't bad, but I've had much better for less dollars.   We enjoyed the view and the desserts, but the attitude of the bartender and waiter was enough to make us not want to come back. There are plenty of fine dining establishments in Vegas. I have no reason to go back to one that is going to give me attitude because I only spent $190 on dinner/drinks.   This was our only experience with rude people in Vegas. Even the other fine dining places were very nice to us even though we don't order the most expensive stuff on the menu.",

Expect to wait 45 minutes so you can sit at the bar and pony up for 20$ cocktails, from practically mute bartenders.   Make a reservation way in advance for strip view tables. Walk ins have no shot. Apparently the tables next to the strip view are booked in advance or you have to know someone.   We finally were seated in a corner and given a very solemn gentleman for a server who must've had a bad night, he was very pretentious and unhelpful with helping us navigate their menu. We went late so both of our first choices were not available. I had the lamb and it was nice and juicy, but not special in any way. The deal breaker was both our sides were plain ol' average. Where was all the elegance?   The pacing was horrid, like we weren't fine dining but at TGI Friday's at happy hour.  I'd never recommend, unless this is a date where you just cared about the views and not the food or the service. The place was gorgeous, but the staff and cooks lack the panache you are paying for!",

We requested to have fountain view seatings and even waited 45 min to do so and sat all the way at the corner with the view of the Paris balloon (even though we had reservations). I felt pushed by the waiter to order more drinks, an appetizer, and a dessert. I had the queen filet mignon and it was very dry, unfortunately. I'm from Texas and I know what real steak is supposed to taste like. The asparagus and potatoes were also okay. Small portions. The waiter did not come to our table once to ask us how the food went. He literally dropped off the food, told us to enjoy, then gave us the dessert menu. It's a cool once in a lifetime thing but I will not come back.",

I leave 3 stars for the greatness of the food, but it's NOT worth the cost! Food was good, but I literally just wasted $30 bucks! For a salad, we were picturing some lettuce, croutons, lobster and all of that for the price, but all we got was this:",

So off we go try this resto.with postcard-perfect view of Vegas.  When our name was called we were invited to the bar which I think a highway robbery, cocktail menu is in the top $.  but hubby was in the mood and ordered a single malt whiskey 18, I don't drink so was given water. We snagged a nice seat in the middle 3rd level area and had a great view of the Bellagio fountain show. To add to the ambiance, a French accented server took our order.   I wanted to order the pork chop but was warned that it is salty *thanks I hate salty food,  so I opted for the rack of lamb 59  (comes in 3 pcs 20 per piece of meat chops WHOA !). For my taste, the tomato and lamb was not a good pairing. I tasted rack of lamb at my local bistro,  w some pear chutney and that was unforgettable. I requested a side of mint jelly to compliment the lamb. That was delish w the jelly. Also ordered a bottle of sparkling water Badoit.   Hubby had the 22 oz ribeye w a bone marrow 89 ordered side of potato gratin 10 and mushroom 15. He was in cow heaven! Paired w cabernet sauvignon. French accented guy recommended to throw in the Seafood platter to the order 69 per person (one order to share). Are you kidding me? it would be gluttony. We sort of agreed at first, then requested to please take it off the seafood platter from the order. I regretted ordering the sides too. With the price of the proteins, all sides MUST come as gratis. But oh well this is Eiffel Tower of LV,  We did not have room for dessert so we said no to the litany of dessert list, but the French accented guy was kind enough to give one small shot of complimentary small chocolate mousse to share.  Overall view is nice, service is attentive yet a bit pushy in the ordering process, The more they throw in the table, the bigger the tip.The guy who offers bread is very friendly,   The bill came to $200+. Will I come back? Maybe not, it was a bit stressful dining here. I truly miss my neck of the woods fine dining.",

It was my first time dining at the Eiffel Tower. I requested a table with a view. I spoke to the host and asked if she received my special requests.. She stated, \"you have the best table in the restaurant.\" Honestly, I did not believe her. I felt that hosts were suppose to say that about every table.. She was not lying! We had the best table in the restaurant - a corner view of the Bellagio fountains.   Our server, Roman, was very professional in assisting and suggesting us items on the menu. I chose the roasted lamb and paired it with a nice glass of red. The lamb was utterly delicious! My girlfriend ordered the truffled chicken. Who knew chicken could taste that good?!  Thank you for accommodating us, and treating us with an unforgettable dining experience. I hope to dine-in again in the near future.  If you're looking for a restaurant to take your significant other, I definitely recommend the Eiffel Tower. You are in for a memorable night!",

They were offering a special prix fixe menu for $250 a person. I was so excited to try it out. They had an amazing lobster appetizer, which was presented beautifully. The disappointment came when they brought out my entree, the filet mignon. It tasted very soapy. I thought it was just me, so I had my boyfriend try it, and he also said, it tasted soapy. My boyfriend ordered the sea bass for his entree, and thankfully it didn't have that soapy flavor, but it was pretty much flavorless. On our way out, the hostess asked us how everything was. I told her about the filet mignon being soapy. She said, \"why didn't you tell anyone?\". I thought to myself, \"aren't you someone?\". She apologized, and showed us to the elevator exit. I don't think I can return to this restaurant, my latest experience did not come close to my expectations.",

My companion has remarkable taste in restaurants and always picks the cream of the crop. The scene was breathtaking. We sat by the window and had a great view overlooking the waterfall at the Bellagio.  We started out with shrimp cocktail for an appetizer. The shrimp were fresh and succulent. It definitely seemed as if the shrimp were caught fresh that day. The food was served with some french bread. Having recently been to France, I found the bread to be quite authentic. For my meal I had the french toast with a side of bacon.  The french toast had a delectable apple swirl atop of the french toast.  My friend had the eggs Benedict. As a lover of eggs Benedict he seemed to be pleased.   This place is definitely a place that we would come visit again when return to Vegas. While they say what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, it doesn't apply to great food.... for that must be shared.",

This is getting off topic because to be honest with you if our food was good i really would not have cared. Out of 7 people in our party 3 ordered off of the price fix menu. One ordered a children's meal, one went with a pasta dish and 2 went with the warm fish entree. Out of all of us, only the 2 with the warm fish entree got through the day unscathed, I have already written to the management and I was told a few days ago that they would forward my concerns to the appropriate department. Working in the food industry (food safety to be more specific). I really think that 5 people getting sick is more than a mere coincidence. Anyhow as you can tell I feel it was extremely overpriced and over rated. After that the only place I would it at was In N Out Burger down the street and I have to admit i was not disappointed.",

But because this event was merely 2 years ago, my boyfriend and I now laugh about how awful the place was. I sure hope this place has improved since.",

They gave us a complimentary dessert (amazzinnnnggg) for my boyfriends birthday and the ambiance and view were also spectacular. The chefs creations were wonderful and I have nothing but positive things to say about this place! I would definitely come back here.",

Manager had a terrible attitude.  Veal medallion was overcooked to medium in order to crowd-please the tourist economy.  Foie Gras was excellent but that was it!  Oh and even though the tasting menu had snapper, the waiter brought salmon without even a forewarning. Two entirely different fish with entirely different flavor profiles. They brought halibut once I complained but still, not The same at all.   Don't go there. Go to Michael Mina's, Joel Robouchon, or Le Cirque if you want a good tasting menu. Leave this behind!!",

Actually proposed to my wife here, was very special.   One slow Vegas night after a show stopped by for a bottle of champagne and a light dinner for four. We were seated then asked to move to another table when two people within our party of four were going to split a steak rather than order their own. Our waitress had a fit and asked the manager to move us. We felt totally blindsided, paid for the bottle of champagne and left. It's apparent where their management and staffs values lie.  They lost customers for life.",

But since there are no future plans for France at this point, and the reviews seem positive, why not?  Getting into the Paris hotel is not terrible because you can come from Las Vegas Blvd or via the back road from Harmon. Walking into Paris to the Eiffel tower is relatively easy if you know which way you are walking. Once you find yourself at the elevator entrance to the restaurant, it's a straight shot to the dining room. I think it's cool that their kitchen is the first thing you see when you get off the elevator.   It was 830p on a Saturday, and the bar was busy. Still lots of people waiting for their tables.  We finally found a couple seats at the bar and ordered what we came for.  The souffles: chocolate and banana. SO good separately but much better together.  Since it's their specialty, they have it perfected.   I would definitely come back, and would like to try dinner. If I come to the bar again, I'll remember to come after 9 so I don't need to stalk for seats at the bar.",

Drinks were decent, amuse bouche of asparagus mousse was pretty good, and the souffles were fabulous as described.  However, neither of our entrees were good. My husband got the vegetarian crepes (the only vegetarian item on the menu) and found them pleasing at first, but overpowering after a few bites. I tasted it, too - it's like whoever created it didn't actually try to sit down and eat a whole one.  For me, the lobster was so tough and stringy that I had a difficult time cutting it with a knife. No delicious dessert can make up for that sort of problem.   Oh, I forgot, we ordered sides as well. The potato croquettes were pretty good as long as they were piping hot. Once the temperature went more toward warm, you could taste the grease, which to me is not ideal.  I'm happy to pay a premium for a great meal/service/ambience, but I expected much better from this place, especially in Vegas where competition is stiff.",

Portions were big enough to be very filling.  Ambiance wasn't quite I imagined it to be. I thought it would be more quiet and romantic. Instead, it was very loud and crowded. I felt like as if I was at Chilis or TGIF. I would prefer my pricier restaurants to feel classier.  Note: Even though I made reservations, I still had to wait in line for 45 minutes. Apparently there were 6 other groups/couples with reservations who 'checked in' before me. Not sure how that works.  Also, there is a dress code.  Minus 2 stars for the price, loud atmosphere and wait time.",

To get there, we entered into the Paris Casino and took an elevator to the 11th level.  We were welcomed by the kitchen to the restaurant, which I thought was the wrong floor, but it was the right one.  We walked around to the other side and found a breath taking view with full windows of the lights and the Vegas strip below.  I really enjoyed the interior architecture of the Eiffel tower steel framing as part of the decor.  The Eiffel Tower Restaurant is very pricey.  As for my first meal and visit to Las Vegas, this was tops.  I was very impressed with the service.  Not a single person was under dressed and I'm sure I would have felt either uncomfortable in jeans or asked to leave.  We order a bottle of wine and were taken care of extremely well.  Our waiter was wonderful explaining the menu and the wine list with precision.  Our meals were exquisite.  We ordered the Veal, Fillet Mignon and potatoes.  Our meals were done perfectly and we finished with a fluffy and mouth watering Chocolate Souffle.  Oooohhhh...makes my mouth water just writing about it.  I highly recommend a reservation on the Bellagio fountain side, window table as we did.  Might be the best meal, including view, I've ever had.",

I had 1/2 an avocado with crab salad and a small cup of coffee. With tax, $35. It was Not worth it. My friend ordered \"onion soup\" What came out was a small bowl of some creamy stuff-no cheeses, no bread, no onion soup au gratinee. And no pre-warning from the waiter. The worst onion soup I have seen for $12. I tried to order artichoke crepes and got something that did not taste like artichokes. but skimpy spinach with a lousy tomato sauce. It was nice of them to take it off my bill since it was terrible and definitely not French. The kitchen was in the forefront of the restaurant for all to see. Frankly, they should hide, considering the mediocre food we received in small portions. I am a native of San Francisco. I've paid steep prices of food, but usually in SF you get what you pay for.

We ask to sit near the fountains overview-didn't happen and they weren't busy at all. I've had 100% better French Onion Soup at a non-French regular old diner joint than here. The French onion soup was creamy like a broc cheese/onion soup and no cheese/bread/or real onion just a thick puree. Secondly, service took forever and after 30 min of waiting for our meals when they weren't even busy at like 2:00pm they told us they were out of steak. So my fiance's mom had to pick something else when she thought we would be getting our meal by then. The blt was good but for the price no way! Only difference was they put avocado on their blt-big whoop and you can get blt's anywhere. I was expecting more exotic French foods. Not overpriced American food and crappy French version of French soup.",

Our food was amazing (I'd recommend definitely getting the souffle for dessert). We had a minuscule mishap when I found a piece of plastic in my scallop potatoes but it was taken care of immediately. In fact we never even brought it up again because we didn't see it as a big deal but they comp'd us for the potatoes anyways. Seriously, everything was great. However, I forgot my phone at the restaurant and didn't notice until we were already back at our hotel. We called the restaurant and they snagged it for us and let us know they would hold it at their hostess stand. We dressed out of our nice clothes that we went to dinner in and out into casual clothes that we were going to gamble in. We headed back to Paris hotel and mentioned to the restaurant that we were only back to grab our phone. They allowed us up the elevator and back into the restaurant. As we are walking towards the hostess stand we were stopped by the greeter who asks us what we are doing. We tell her that we are only here to grab my phone because we had eaten there earlier and forgotten it. Her only reply to us is that we can't eat here because we are not dressed appropriately and will need to leave. We again mention that we just need my phone. She says ok and we get to the hostess stand. No problem there, we grab my phone and are walking back out. Literally 5 seconds. As we are waiting for the elevator to go back downstairs the chefs behind us start snickering and making mocking comments about how we can't eat here because there's a dress code. \"Uh you know there's a dress code, you can't eat here\" then more chefs laugh along at the mocking comments. We ignore them, half embarrassed because we were only here to pick up a phone and half disappointed because we had such high regards for this restaurant but now are being disrespected. We called the manager and he apologized up and down however we are still leaving the restaurant with a bad taste in our mouths with zero desire to return. Which really is upsetting because after our dinner we were already making plans to come back to Vegas and make the Eiffel Tower a must when we return. Now we would rather eat anywhere else.",

They have a large and impressive wine list but the pricing is way out-of-bounds at 4 to 10 times retail.  I've been there 4 times now and find the quality to be consistent.

We were seated at a corner table overlooking the Paris Balloon and the strip.  Reservations were at 8:30pm. It was so romantic! I strongly recommending asking for a window seat and/or a corner table.   We started with a riesling from the alsace region. It was delicious.  We received a complimentary appetizer, an asparagus puree. Bread choices were multi-grain, french baguette, or wheat. Water is either sparkling or flat.   Main Entrees: * He had the filet mignon. Absolutely delectable! I had the rack of lamb. Melted in my mouth like butter.   Desserts: THE SOUFFLES ARE TO DIE FOR!  *He had the Pistachio Souffle. As I quote my boyfriend, \"Honey, I can now go to the top of the Eiffel Tower and jump because it just doesn't get any better than this. Sorry, babe but this pistachio souffle is just better than sex!\" And people, let me tell you ... it is True! I totally agree with him and we have great sex! It was heavenly.   * I had the Grand Marnier Souffle.  That was absolutely delicious too ... but it was all about the Pistachio Souffle!  * We also received a complimentary dark chocolate mousse. Wow! Just yummy!  Overall - it was an awesome experience! Yuri, our waiter, was attentive and friendly.  Lyle, the manager was accommodating and pleasant.  I have high standards. It goes beyond Patina in Los Angeles. Maestro's is still a favorite but the Eiffel Tower was just that phenomenal!",

We were seating promptly and just as the sun was going down and all of the lights on the strip came up! The waitstaff was excellent and the sommelier very knowledgeable and helpful. Service was excellent and the food very good, but not memorable. The food was good enough to make us come back next time, but mostly for the ambiance and view.",

The restaurant was gorgeous and no matter where you are seated, you get an amazing view of the strip and the Bellagio hotel. Sit by the window, like we did, and you'll catch the Bellagio's water show while you dine.  Our dinner was superb! The Char Broiled Filet Mignon accompanied with mashed potatoes-- mouth- watering good! For dessert, can you believe they make souffles 6 different ways? We've never had banana souffles so we went for it. Definitely one of the most delicious and memorable dessert we've had.",

The decor is great;  glass floor-to-ceiling all around.  I got a window fountain view table even though I was by myself.   There are very few \"bad\" tables.  Unfortunately, as with every place where the claim to fame is the location or the view, the food falls down.  Hard.  It's as if the chefs are blind robots trained at the Culinary Institute of America: everything appears to be well prepared and nicely presented, but they all taste as if nobody in the kitchen has taste buds.  They're uniformly bland.  (Well, at least, they're *uniformly* bland and not some bland some too salty!)  The bread was not too bad.  The fish was cooked to the proper doneness, but was... bland.  It came with a corn salsa where the corn kernels had bits of cob on them, as if cut off the cob by an amateur home cook.  To cap it all off, the dessert came garnished with a sprig of mint that is wilted, with one leaf half blackened (hence my \"blind\" robot observation).  The quality is definitely not worth the $100+ per person for the tasting menu.  For that price, you can get amazing food at countless other Vegas eateries: Sage, Joel Robuchon & Joel Robuchon Atelier, Scarpetta, etc.",

My husband got the Char Broiled Filet Mignon, which was the best cut of meat we've ever eaten.  I got the Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras.  I've never had duck before, but it was a nice meat. It was a bit chewy, but it had good flavor.  Get one of their souffles!  It takes 30 minutes to cook, but it's well worth the wait.  I also recommend the Non-Traditional Caesar Salad as a salad option.  They gave a complementary birthday dessert, as well as little petit fours to close the meal (such a lovely touch).  I also ordered a Pineapple Rum drink that was tasty but not worth $20, in my opinion.    The view is beautiful, as is the atmosphere.  Highly recommend if you're looking for a romantic evening.",

I would recommend the burgers.  I enjoyed the shrimp appetizers and the dessert ice cream souffle from the brunch menu.  The steak and eggs was just okay, it was a flat iron steak and sliced. I have tried the salmon omelette and that is good.  The prefixed brunch menu is $39.99 per person.",

Both being in the restaurant business ourselves and celebrating a combination of my birthday and our 5 year anniversary this restaurant had come highly recommended by fellow foodie friends.  We made reservations on Open Table but arrived early hoping to perhaps be seated earlier or have a cocktail - as we were looking at the drink list the hostess informed us that a table was indeed open for us and YES a view table as we had requested!  We had the tasting menu with the wine pairings (after enjoying a Singapore Sling)  Carmen our server was spot on, professional, polite, knowledgeable but not intrusive.  Jose our backwaiter kept our waters filled and our bread plates going and we had so much fun bantering with him - I told him Jose was not a very \"French\" name so I would call him \"Pierre\"  we had fun all night asking Pierre for this or that - If we could afford to go back we would in a heartbeat - and the view!  What a view!  The only drawback is my husband would have loved to sub the veal for the duck on the tasting menu but I guess the kitchen is not open to doing such requests - oh well",

Even our waiter was French (maybe he was faking it, after all have you hear Rick's voice from the Walking Dead?? CRAZY!) The steak was amazing (and I'm a Texan y'all!) and the potatoe croquettes were to die for! The creme de la crop was the Creme brulee. I am still dreaming about it...(sorry honey)  The drink was awesome, don't get me wrong (pink something??) but $19?!! I coulda gotten one of those yard stick margaritas for that (which I did after, to show my classiness)   Did I mention you can see the Belagio fountains perfectly?? It's pretty amazing. We will definitely go back here. Next time I will 86 the drink and save the $ for gambling (or a second creme brulee, who knows??) Oui Oui!!",

The food was terrible!!!  We paid $140 per person for 9 family members (do the math and then add 20% gratuity plus tax ) to celebrate our daughters birthday...which also happens to be Valentine's Day. I get it, the whole idea of a pre-set menu, it's all about feeding the masses, quantity over quality. But for that price you expect quality! The filet was tough and needed a hack saw to cut into it. I chose the sea bass. What a joke! I've had sea bass many times. It's thick and meaty. This was the thinnest puny piece of fish I've ever had that claimed to be \"sea bass\". Simply put, I'd expect this type of cheap cuts of meat & subpar side dishes at a buffet for $29. Not $140.  The wait staff however,was 5 stars!! They were polite, attentive, and overall just very professional. I couldn't find a negative if I tried. So if you don't mind dropping a ton of money on the \"experience\" go for it. If you actually enjoy good food, skip this place altogether.",

Overlooks the Strip and the recurring water show below, which partially explains why the Eiffel Tower may push past the price envelope, at times. Or maybe this is just Vegas, done in style. Regardless, when you're here, enjoy yourself and celebrate all things good.  One reason to come here was the Chef had created Brasserie Jo, in Chicago, one of my favorite places ever.  Do ask for a window seat when you approach the Hostess stand. Repair at the swanky and luxurious bar as they make your table ready. Take in the room now, because soon you'll be looking out onto the beautiful vista -- as well as at your beautiful dining companion. And when food begins to arrive, you will want to gaze deeply into the works of art that wait demurely on your plates.    *Maine Lobster Salad, Watermelon Tartar, Water Chestnuts, Pistachio Vinaigrette is a delightful starter. Fresh, light and substantial all at once.  * Warm Caesar a la Francaise, Capers, Garlic was not entirely satisfying. Though the Romaine confidently snapped and crunched beautifully, the *warm* part was absent. True, we had the dressing on the side. But the atypical Caesar dressing came room temp at best. My dining companion spotted our salad waiting on a table or stand nearby for several minutes before it got delivered by a backwaiter/busboy. Halfway into the salad we informed our server about the temperature problem. He apologized but made no efforts to remedy the situation there and then, nor later at the time of the bill.   While debating which entrees to try, I thought our server gilded the lily saying how rare it is to see dishes like Dover Sole and the Beef Wellington on a menu. I saw them both offered at Mon Ami Gabi.  *Sea Bass, Shaved Asparagus, Quinoa Gallette, Champagne Brown Butter Broth was appreciated by my dining companion -- though I felt it to be far too lemony, and fairly mundane. Adequate, but not thrilling.  *Boneless Organic Rabbit, Braised Carrots Confits, Mustard Jus, however, I thought was Outstanding! The description relies on the verbal, though, and here our server got it just right. While half the dish is simply (and perfectly), the second part was a a more complex sausage made from the loin mixed with some vegetables -- so flavorful. Highly recommended. The carrots (haha) were delicious too.   *Chocolate Souffle was a perfect ending. While someone here on Yelp grumbled it was small -- I think it was just right. I love a great Chocolate Souffle and when it's not great, I tell the restaurant there and then. This was great.  We muddled a bit over wine choices, and our server wasn't a great help. Maybe because they were busy, but we fairly soon enough got a nice visit from the Sommelier who steered us to a lovely White Bordeaux. We began the night with some fun cocktails off the Drink List. And we ended with excellent coffee and a latte.  We loved the bread selection and the re-appearance of the gent who delivered them. A different guy, alas, dropped my salad utensils on me as they slipped off the plate. Also, when we sat down and were asked about the water, still or sparkling -- it would have been appropriate to mention bottled or not. Not the end of the world, but a teensy bit presumptuous. The not-so-warm Caesar, the bobbling busboy contributed to this being a four not five star review. Still, it was a fabulous dinner.",

We had the pleasure of being served by Ridge the bartender, who was fantastic. We only ate dessert but the souffle and apple strudel were awesome and our port/liquor pairings were perfectly on-point (thanks Ridge!)

I had the salmon and it had nice flavor. . My husband had the filet and felt it wasn't as great as he has had in other restaurants (especially for the price!). My son had the chicken off the main menu and it was delicious. For dessert we had the Caramel Souffle which was to die for!  The service was outstanding and although we did not have a window seat the view was spectacular!  It was a definite great place to go once for the experience or for a special occasion.

    "text": "Everything was worth the price. From the food down to the service. We called the restaurant a day before on a Tuesday to reserve a window table to the Bellagio fountains for 6:30pm on a Wednesday night. As soon as we arrived they walked us over to the most perfect seat in the house, right in front of the fountains. We were able to see the fountains go off a total of three times while we were there. We had the waiter check in on us about every 10 minutes, and they were constantly refilling our water. I got the \"king\" filet mignon and the meat just melted in my mouth. It was perfectly seasoned and cooked just right (medium-well). I made sure to savor every bite. The mashed potatoes were also to die for. I got both the wheat and the French bread but the wheat was easier to chew. We ordered the caramel souffle right when we ordered the appetizer and as soon as we were done with our dinner, they brought it fresh from the oven. It felt like we were tasting a little piece of heaven. It was so warm and soft, it was just amazing. Overall, my boyfriend and I had a very romantic dinner with such a beautiful view. The bill came out to about $200 with an appetizer, a glass of wine, dinner for two and a dessert. We're not ones to eat fancy dinners very often, but if you ask me, it was totally worth it.",

I ordered a salad that did not say on the menu description that it was apparently sauteed in bacon fat and topped with bacon. I was quite disappointed and ended up switching salads with my friend who ordered the kale salad.   From the beginning I was unimpressed. The tables were extremely close together and hard to get up and go to the restroom (due to the narrow walkway and narrow space between tables), the starter was a complementary cold cream corn soup in a shot glass.. i think its self explainatory as to why it was unimpressive, the scallops we ordered was a total of two scallops  (one whole and one cut in half to look like 3) which I would have preferred to be cooked a bit more to be a bit carmelized on the bottom.  Also, There is a photographer that comes around and asks to take a picture and will later tell you they can add it to your bill for 20 something dollars.. It would be nice but the photo we received was blurry. Being yelpers, we don't complain we just write about it later.. haha.  However, The dessert made my experience so much better. I ordered the banana tower with white chocolate and it was exquisite.   Overall, the food isn't anything to write home about, the view isn't as great as I thought it would be, its not great for the claustrophobic, but you must try the dessert.",

    "text": "ATMOSPHERE: The restaurant knows what their selling point is: the view of the strip. It is absolutely incredible. Perfect view of the Bellagio fountains, Cosmo hotel, and the big Paris balloon. I had the pleasure of viewing the scene during the daytime and during then night...the view totally transforms before your eyes when the sun sets. Took plenty of pictures.  The tables are quite close together, they want to pack the place up. NOT good for groups, tables are mostly meant for 2-3 people. Noise level wise, it was louder than I expected, lots of glass clanking and I could hear the kitchen and bar.  FOOD: The food was quite delicious. I will say it's not the BEST I have ever tasted but it was still delicious all around. (Pictures posted up in pics).  Pre-appetizer: they give you a little avacado mousseline in a shot glass type. Tasty. And I always appreciate complimentary dishes. The bread guy was really funny. He will come around with a giant bread plate and give you 5 choices of bread.   Appetizer: got the scallops with ox tail and the quail. Both quite delicious. Quail was better. Scallops were good but I found it interesting that it was in a dark meat sauce (since I associate scallops with lighter sauces).  Entrees: Got the 7 oz. filet minion and the short ribs. Filet was better probably because the cut of the meat was just better. Though the flavoring was still better than the short ribs. I found the ribs slightly on the dry side. They give you 5 large pieces so definitely worth it. The butter noodles and the veggies that came with it were just OK.  Side dish: the potato croquettes were really just potato shaped like finger-length sticks and fried. It was very meh, pretty bland.  Dessert: SOUFFLES. Hands down. Got the chocolate and the pistachio. Pistachio was MUCH MORE delicious. Even the waiter said everyone in the kitchen prefers the Pistachio. GET IT. The chocolate one was not that chocolatey...  Overall the experience was very unique and nice. The view is not to be replicated anywhere else. Food was good, but as you know, very expensive. You really pay for the view and the experience.   Oh they'll come take a picture of you and you can buy it for $24. Wasn't worth it for me considering I took plenty of pics on my own. =)",

Our waiter came and we politely and  by making some funny comments we let   him know  we are not gonna be his most valued guests tonight. My wife is pregnant so she is good with a water, and I am okay with a glass of wine, plus we have a reservation in an other place so we  just like to kill the time and share one appetizer. In this industry if someone like us telling you up front you not gonna make any money on them, most people won't give a f., but least they will give you the feeling of not giving a f. In our case this not what  happened. He maintained his professional attitude in the whole time we were there, and handled us like his money bags. I have to compliment them and a positive review is the minimum what I can give to this place. To make employees to be  happy and professional, under in that kind of circumstance, it takes an exceptional management and crew. Many restaurants should learn from them. Good job.",

    "text": "So we came here on April 16th for my wife's birthday  and we asked our waiter what he recommended  the chicken I then asked what it came with and he never mentioned onions which I'm extremely allergic too.  So we order drinks and we waited for dinner to be served. It was very hard to get his attention because he was so rude to begin with. So the food came out and looked great I started to eat and started getting hot flashes so my wife starts to move the chicken and there's tons of onions so I had to stop eating  and asked  the waiter why didn't he mention there was onions and he was just rude about it and said well I didn't have to mention that because I should know there's onions in all french food even after I had told him we had never ate at a french restaurant. But besides the mishap and the rude waiter the view was beautiful and my wife enjoyed her food and that's all that mattered..   The funny thing is that besides the mishap my believes if you don't leave good tips you get bad luck at restaurants so we tipped him $60 and LoL when we were leaving we saw him looking how much we left him and I was going to the bathroom to put water on my face and when I came out he was talking to my wife saying how much he was concerned with my health and much he enjoyed us. I was like really?? ?? Just because we tipped you??? I'm glad I wasn't there when he said that ...  So \"Jorge\" the waiter profile someone that comes to your restaurant because don't think we didn't see the two ladies next us that you were kissing the butt the whole night and they ran up a $400 tab and left you $5 bucks. We seen what they left you..  But if you want a beautiful view eating dinner with your spouse or that special somebody then go here and enjoy. If you get Jorge tell him we said hi lol",

The Aged Parmesan Crusted Chicken was not up to Eiffel Tower's usual standard.  It came out completely soggy and greasy.  We sent it back to the kitchen and the reincarnated version was an improvement but no match for the one we had on a prior visit.  Service was good and our waiter made up for the food fiasco.",

So after a quick change we were having cocktail by a table near the window. From time to time you can see the water and lights show across the street at Bellagio. The service here is superb. I ordered the beef wellington. It took about half an hour which we knew but it was well worth the wait. It was absolutely delicious. For dessert I ordered the Grand Marnier Souffle. This too took some time but it was incredible. Next time I'm in Vegas I will be dining here again.",

Make reservations in advance and ask to be sat at the windows facing the Bellagio. This restaurant is about 6 floor up from street level so that you will have an amazing view of the fountains as they show every 20 minutes. The food and service exceeds the view. You feel well taken care of from the minute you check in for the private elevator, through the reception desk and to your seat. The food had us moaning much like Meg Ryan in \"When Harry met Sally\". Kale salad, Lobster Bisque, Filet Mignon, NY Strip steak. Pre dinner complimentary cold cream of celery soup and post dinner complimentary petite fours. Served impeccably by an attentive but not intrusive staff.  Men must wear a jacket  and collared shirt if you don't have one they will loan you one. Be prepared to drop $250 minimum and more likely $300 plus for 2 people. It is worth it..",

It was expensive but you can't beat the food and the location. The service was spot on.

One glance at the menu and those $70-$80 plates quickly caught our eyes. The hostess recommended we go ahead and check out the view at least and get a drink. We arrived to the top and were immediately greeted. We deferred to the bar which did have a some tables overlooking the Bellagio fountains. I believe four chairs in total. She had a couple glasses of wine, and I had the Eiffel Avenue (sweet and tasty).  Signature cocktails were $19. We had the apple strudel with a scoop of ice cream which was ample for two. We did see the fountains a few times and were able to get them in some selfies. Great experience.",

However, for this place, we make the trip.   The food is perfect. The service is perfect. We've now been served by Anthony and Alix. Both marvelous. Great personalities and very good at their craft.   We spent dinner Thanksgiving here. We strayed away from our typical prime rib dinner to do something different in 2017 and it was worth the risk.

You have to guarantee your reservation with a credit card and for Vday actually pay a ridiculous  $195 per person up front. I now know why. Fixed menu that was terrible. They must have given the regular chef off. Maybe always bad since this was my first (and last) time there.  Started with a ride up in the elevator with an escort that had the personality of a log. Then a long wait even with a reservation only seating policy. I verified a window table via phone after credit card payment and was confirmed until we show up and waited. Then denied and told with no apology that it isn't guaranteed. Tried to move on with the night. Drinks came in a timely manner but food courses were spaced out much too far. I guess they were busy burning them and then letting them sit out. Honestly, even having the best company in the world couldn't save this overpriced slop. Much better French dining all around and definitely don't rely on this place for a romantic evening. To be fair, I'm sure it's the best view, but the next night we went to the Cabo Wabo bar & grill with a second story view of the Bellagio fountains and strip and the Mexican inspired food, atmosphere, and vibe was so much better for a tenth of the price.",

The stewardess will come DIRECTLY to you when your table is ready.  Cons: -Price - (Cheapest meals are $40 and $20 a drink) -Wait Time - (Waited 30 minutes WITH reservation) -Not for Children (There are no Chicken Nuggets here)  Straight to the point: this restaurant is amazing! None of the food was bad and everything ranged from amazing to \"can I legally marry this?\". The location is also amazing with a view of the bellagio fountains! The Ambiance was a nice and very adult! Overall: 10/10 experience and WILL be back for more!  Recommendations: Filet Mignon Mashed Potatoes",

We don't often partake in fine dining, and when we do (usually for special occasions) we want it to be well worth our time. Eiffel Tower exceeded all expectations, and then some! If you eat here, you should absolutely request Heather as your server. She provided possibly the best service I've ever had, and she made us feel right at home from the very beginning.   Now the food: we started with the foie Gras and duck prosciutto, which was nothing short of heavenly. My entree was the salmon, and it was seared to perfection, but my boyfriend had the duck, and after his first bite, I genuinely thought he would start crying! The view of the Vegas Strip was beyond incredible, and we had a perfect view of the Bellagio Fountains. We will definitely come back to Heather any time we're in Vegas!",

This visit to the restaurant unfortunately was marred by being seated at a table for 4 in a dark corner by one of the decorative posts. We had booked well in advance, confirmed our visit by credit card and even responded to the email guaranteeing a window seat if we agreed to come 1/2 hour earlier which we could not due to our show before we went for dinner. Apart from that everything was great as usual with the service, sommelier's recommendation and the quality of food. We also were well-dressed as usual befitting the standard of the restaurant. Hopefully next time this will not happen again as it has not in the past. Perhaps some oversight on your greeting and seating staff would be in order as we did not want to complain with our family there on this special occasion.",

    "text": "Definitely one of the highlight meals from our latest visit to Las Vegas.  Highly recommended!    Tips: 1.  Make a reservation on their site.   2.  Go for weekend brunch.  We reserved for Sunday brunch on September 2nd, over Labor Day Weekend.   We were very pleasantly surprised to be seated at with a great window view of the strip (Bellagio/Caesar's side).  The restaurant was not overly crowded.  When we came in (11:30am) all couples were seated with window views, which is terrific considering the restaurant recommends a 4:30pm(!) Dinner reservation for a window table.   Definitely go for weekend brunch!  I had the Lobster benedict, wife had the Maine Lobster salad --  both were was very, very good.  Service was excellent.   Attentive and helpful with recommendations; but not 'hovering' or rushing you to finish at all.   A lovely dining experience that we will certainly return to repeat.  The views during brunch from the Eiffel Tower restaurant complement a truly great meal.",

    "text": "Our hopes were high going into this experience, so maybe that was our downfall. Our friends had tried the tasting menu here a couple of years back, and still talk about it to this day as one of the best they have ever had. So, when we all decided to take the trip to Vegas they immediately made a reservation for the four of us.  The elevator ride up is pretty fun, although I was extremely turned off by the elevator doors on the restaurant level, which are covered in so much dust it almost looks like it was intentional. It's likely no one else would notice this, as you have maybe 5 seconds of a view before the doors open/close, but that put me off.   We were seated right away for our 8pm reservation, and our server was lovely. She made great drink recommendations, and I was very pleased with the Daisy, which she proclaimed was her favorite drink. Pleasantly sweet, with just the right amount of spicy. The service was great overall (who doesn't love being offered bread every time your bread plate is empty?).  The thing that really didn't work for us was what we had come for: the tasting menu. We were told it was a bit different for the weekend we were there (the Friday before New Year's Eve), and that we were lucky because we had the opportunity to try all of the entree dishes from the New Year's Eve menu, while diners on New Year's Eve would only have the opportunity to select one. This sounded good in theory, but what we were left with was an overly rich, salty barrage of dishes with no progression, and no balance. For the price tag of $145 per person before drinks ($20 per cocktail, $8 for an Arnold Palmer, $6 for a Ginger Ale, plus an additional $8 per souffle, if you go that route), the meal really should have worked better.  Because we were given the opportunity to make substitutions, and I was feeling the cold foie gras over the sauteed foie gras that was listed on the tasting menu, we made that swap. Unfortunately, we probably would have swapped out half of the dishes had we had the foresight.  * Les Amuses Bouches - all VERY tasty.  * Crispy Maine Lobster Roulade, Avocado, Endive - this was delicious, but they skimped on the claw meat on my friend's plate. We asked if it was intended to be that way, and they assured us it wasn't and replaced his plate.  * Cold Foie Gras Torchon, Duck Prosciutto, Fig Compote (vs. Sauteed New York Foie Gras, Persimmon, Walnut Financier, Walnut Crumble) - really, really good, and so happy we made the swap. Tasted even better alone than with the toast points they provide, but good either way.  * Sea Bass, Sunchoke Emulsion, Roasted Chanterelle Mushrooms, Pinot Noir Reduction - was not into this at all. The fish was cooked well, but everything was salty and heavy, and reminded me of all the things I don't enjoy about certain French dishes. My friend also found three large bones in her filet.  * Filet Mignon, Braised Short Ribs, Romanesco, Thumbelina Carrots, Cabernet Jus, Puff Pastry Tuile - again, very heavy, to the point where we were questioning why the short ribs were there (and then questioning ourselves for ever questioning the presence of short ribs). Did not work as a tasting menu dish, though probably would work as an entree. I only ate a couple of bites, and still felt uncomfortably full at this point.  * Composition of French Cheeses, Candied Pecans - \"They can't mess up a cheese plate,\" we said. How wrong we were. All of the cheeses were extremely potent, and nothing worked together. There was frisee on the plate for some reason. The pear moutard was weird and unpleasant when paired with the stinky cheeses, and the candied pecans were dry and unwelcome. I, an avid cheese lover, couldn't even finish half of my plate.  * Choice of Eiffel Tower Desserts - while the desserts were good, I was so uncomfortable from the heaviness of the meal that I could barely take a bite of each one. We ordered the Chocolate Plate, the Champagne (everyone's favorite), and Pistachio (second favorite) and Grand Marnier souffles.  * Petit Fours - nothing exciting, not extremely welcome at the end of this meal either.  We also ordered the Galette of Potato Anna as a side, but that was not memorable.  While my boyfriend and I were not nearly as disappointed as our friends, I can say this felt like a waste of money. We didn't expect anything to come of the mistake with the lobster, the bones, or the fact that one of the staff spilled water all over my boyfriend, but it would have been a nice touch to see something reflected on the bill. No such luck.  We were unable to file a complaint with anyone there, as they said they would only entertain Yelp reviews, so here I am. They also could not validate our parking, as they operate independently of the casino, so it felt like one disappointment after another.   I would probably give the Eiffel Tower another chance, but it would take a lot to impress me at this point.",

The John Dory was good but the hen of the woods mushrooms were the only different presentation to what was essentially a piece of well cooked, average fish.  The course that had me from first sight was the venison medallions.  Perfectly done, rare, with turnip, caramelized onion compote, and huckleberry sauce.  Great flavors and a perfect dish.     The cheese course was very sparse.  Three small pieces with the star the bleu cheese.  I could have stolen the wheel from the kitchen if I could have gotten away with it.  The mignardises tray had one new item that I could tell.  The rest have been around for years.  Service was excellent!! Isabelle was personable, knowledgable, and a delight to talk to.  What I'm looking from Chef Joho is to take a chance.  Do something outside this very safe tasting menu and give me something to walk away with a big wow in my head.",

    "text": "After viewing those unbelievably talented Chefs on The Iron Chef shows, I had a craving for the best French food while staying at the Paris Hotel in Las Vegas.  I walked around for half an hour, and was totally frustrated (and hungry at 10PM after a long flight) that I could not find a real French restaurant by walking around the Paris casino lobby.  Finally, the concierge walked me to the Eiffel Tower, \"that's where you find real French food.\"  Oui!  An older middle-aged lady, very well-dressed and hmmm.... well-proportioned ...  took me to the elevator behind her.  In a few seconds through layers of steel super structures, I arrived at the restaurant.    Scene 1:  First Impression.  Elevator opens to the kitchen with displays of dishes, stainless steel wares, and busboys. If my synapses were not all firing tonight, I would have thought I'd entered the restaurant through the kitchen from the alley.  1 out of 5 stars.     Scene 2:  Chit Chat.  The greeter took me to the Hostess kiosk where I had to wait for the boy/girl chit chatting before they would address me.  1/5.  Scene 3:  They asked for my reservation name.  The restaurant was half full (empty?) so I said I did not have one.  She said \"Let me find a table for you.\"  Within minutes, they found a table for me -- on the inside wall where the view was to another table.  Wait, what's wrong with any of the tables overlooking the Bellagio water fountain dancing thing?  They were all sitting empty.... vacant... unoccupied..  \"Well, Sir, we are trying to shut down that portion of the restaurant this time of the night, but let me check.\"  As if he was a Secret Service agent, he touched his ear and talk into his wrist and then asked me to return to the lobby while they set up my new table!  Now we talking.  3 out of 5.   Scene 4:  The Tea.  \"Shall we start you with some wine perhaps?\"  \"No, thank you.  I will have green tea please.\"  \"Am sorry, we have no green tea.  But we have black and peach tea.  Very nice.\"  Am easy to please, so I agreed to the peach tea.  What came out?  Ice tea!  Am easy to please, so I kept the ice tea, unsweetened out of a very nice bottle.  \"Can I also get a cup of hot tea, please.\"  \"Am sorry Sir, we don't have hot tea.\"  Really? The French don't drink tea?  How do you all get sober after being drunk from all that wine?  What am I going to wash down my fine dining with?  I can't really ask for a Coke Zero.  If the French don't drink hot tea, am certain they won't drink Coke Zero.  She gave an uncomfortable smile as I gave her an awkward frown on the tea thing.  \"Perhaps you would like coffee instead.\"  I told her I'm mormon.  That stopped further suggestions.  I was thinking of Dave (mormon friend) when I said that.  I was satisfied that my response immediately wiped away her smile.  1/5.  Scene 5:  The Appetizer.  The fun begins here.  Food tastes great at a great restaurant.  Food would probably taste heavenly if you are hungry, at the \"finest French restaurant in Vegas,\" in the  Paris hotel perched high in the Eiffel tower.  I escargot.  \"But I want you to know, it only comes with 5 escargots.\"  What on my forehead said I wanted a pound of escargots sauteed and served on a hot dog bun?  I smiled and politely said that was a great portion.  A few minutes later... \"Am sorry Sir.  The chef said we are out of escargot for tonight.\"  But it's a French restaurant!  It's like McD is out of french fries.  Fine.  What else ya got?  After some prodding to try cold smoked salmon, I settled on \"giant scallops on a bed of ox tail.\"  After a weekend of pho at home, I am up to my eye browse with ox tails, but the scallops was appealing because it was light.  I want to be French tonight.  Light portions.  Great presentation.  Explosive tastes.  The scallop (one) wasn't giant. but it was good.  The oxtail was horrendous, however.  You know the levels of saltiness.  At the bottom it is bland, then a hint of salt, then \"to taste\", then salty, then really salty, then bitter.  Mine was bitter.  2 out of 5.    Scene 6:  The Bread.  Before the appetizer came out, the bread man came along.  It was a nice silver tray with different breads laid out in rows to categorize the different breads.  He took 2 spoons and created a make-shift tong to handle the bread. French-like.  I chose the sesame seed bread.  Then he said \"you get to choose two.\"  Oh my gosh!  For a $100 meal I get to choose 2.  What if I wanted 3?  1 star.    Scene 7:  Duck.  Perfectly cooked.  Red.  Moist.  Skin wasn't crunchy as I preferred.  They served the duck on a bed of what tasted like salty and smooshy fruit cake.  Did not complement well at all.  I had to cut the muscle and skin from the breast.  The reduction encircling the duck was again salty. 2/5.  Scene 8:  Desert.  The banana souffle was the highlight.  I had to order it first so the chef can start it right away.  Fluffy, light, airy.  Exactly how it should be.  5/5.  Not worth it.  View was nice, though.",

It was summer and extremely hot (109+ degrees) but slightly more formal attire was recommended.  We were in formal attire but later noticed that some were in business-casual attire.  There were still many in formal attire as well.  The restaurant is located in the Paris Hotel/Casino.  There's an elevator that takes you from the casino lobby to the restaurant located in its \"Eiffel Tower.\"  We made dinner reservations and we got there a bit early so we went to the bar for a cocktail.  I'm not big on alcoholic beverages so I ordered the \"Sparkling Passion.\"  I don't remember but it was a sparkling wine with orange juice and some kind of fruit puree.  It was very good!  This was a few years ago so all I remember about the food was the complimentary cheese bread being probably one of our favorite dishes haha.  Our table had an amazing panoramic view of the Bellagio fountains.  It was really beautiful.  This is a great place to have a romantic dinner.  Apparently, my significant other ordered a surprise delivery but it never got to the restaurant.  The manager at the time was apologetic and tried to make things right for us so we appreciated the good customer service.",

The prices were a bit high, the views are nice, the service is good but a little stuffy.  Its got a high class vibe due to the French servers, but there weren't many people in there for Sunday brunch, so it had kind of an awkward feel too.  I imagine dinner in a full dining room with the Bellagio fountain light show going in the background would be best.",

    "text": "Come for the view, maybe leave without food! At least this was my last experience with the Eiffel Tower restaurant.   I have been in to eat 3 times now. The first 2 times were wonderful; 4 stars. This last time however was an abysmal 1 star.  First of all, the view of the Bellagio and their stunning fountain is fantastic. Romantic, breathtaking and all other adjectives found in thesaurus. The staff is 5 stars all the way; from the helpful hostesses to the swift bread guy that is at your table though out your entire meal making sure you have a new, fresh piece of bread from the 5 different varieties in the basket.  Amazing! Kudos to him. The wait staff is all uniformly good as well - although at one point I finished my glass of wine and instead of refilling it from the bottle at the table, my waitress snatched it away leaving me wine free. I had to flag someone down to get me a fresh glass! And this is in Vegas! Humph, not impressed.   Now, on to the food: My very first time in I ordered the seafood tower - go big or go home, right? It was crazy expense and worth every penny. It was fresh, tasty, totally over the top with how gigantic it was and resulted in a story to be told for years. My second time in was for a family meal. We went traditional with fish or steak entrees; the decadent bacon brussel sprouts on the side as well as potatoes. This meal had nothing negative to comment on.  Overpriced but when you factor in the view, worth it for sure. Now my most recent visit: I decided to really see what the menu was like away from the tried and True entrees. So, I started with Lobster Bouillon soup with lobster flan, Celery and toasted brioche. The soup was creamy, very rich and the brioche was perfect to dip in.  The flan however was like an orange, wiggly, tasteless blob... Like, crazy tasteless. Next I had the worst, over vinegary, kale salad ever. And I love balsamic vinegar, I even drizzle it on ice cream! This salad was horrible, oh, and had 3 tiny cherries.... Thanks, wouldn't want to over cherry, you might take away from the all the vinegar.     Finally, I was so excited to have the Foie Gras Torchon with duck prosciutto and fig compote. The Foie was slimy on top and congealed so it was hard to break through, I had to use a knife to cut it!  Also didn't have that amazing buttery, melt in your mouth quality; it actually didn't taste much at all. I have never seen or tasted Foie like this - I know Canada is lucky that we have free-range farms and ability to produce amazing, sinfully delicious tasting Foie. This was just disappointing and sad. Hands down the worst Foie I have ever had.  Oh, and the duck prosciutto was as hard as glass. It actually cut my gum open when I tried to chew it.   I would have had dessert but my mouth was bleeding from the duck glass.   Le repas etait horrible!",

They also served complimentary bread puffs and a nice pistachio pudding.   Having recently gone to the Hancock's 95th floor Signature Room, I thought we might be going to the top of the Eiffel Tower, but this place is like at the 5th floor elevation.

The bread is to die for and consistent with authentic French bread straight from the oven, and the beef Wellington was so tender I cut it with a fork! The putter pastry was flakey and light with the right balance of crunch on the crust and soft fluffy pastry near the meat center. I am picky on steaks and do not like when they are over cooked, and this was spot on perfect as far as how it was cooked. My only reason for not rating this a five is the wait even with reservations- when there were empty tables comparable to ours. It seemed odd that several couples and groups were left to wait even though there was clearly seating available.",

    "text": "Surprise dinner here for my bday. Bf kept saying the food might not be great bc a lot of reviews only talk about the nice ambiance. We had dinner at the palm in caesar's the night before and it was disappointing. The Eiffel tower made up for that.   The restaurant is romantic and nice with an awesome view of the strip and the bellagio water show. I had the lamb chops with foie gras $48. The bf had the duck breast $39. The side we chose was the potatoes croquette $10. The lamb chops was really good and tender but u only get 2. I guess I didn't pay attention to the dish description bc the foie gras is what makes it so expensive. I didn't know and tried it and then figured out what it was. So that was the only disappointment. Rather would've had extra lamb instead. Haha. The bf's duck breast was really yummy too. Nice and tender and moist. The potato croquettes were ok. I'd choose another side next time. For dessert we had the chocolate souffle $15. When they bring it out the server makes a hole and drizzles in melted chocolate which makes it extra rich. I would have preferred to do that myself. The parts not drenched in melted chocolate was less sweet and tasted very light. I would ask them to not pour it in if you prefer it not be so sweet.   In addition for my bday we got a small chocolate parfait with happy birthday on it which was very nice. And then they also bring out petit desserts to choose 1 to try. The service here is amazing. The atmosphere is awesome. There's also a photographer to take your pic with the Paris sign in the background. It's $24 for a 5x7 and they also email you the pic to have as a digital copy and add to your phone pics. Overall really like this place for a romantic dinner. It's super fancy but guys only need to wear a collared shirt. The hostesses wear long black gowns. And servers wear tuxedo like outfits bowtie and all.",

The service and the staff is top notch and they will do anything to make you feel welcomed from the bartender to the the waiter to the wine connoisseur, they were all intensive to our needs.  I dropped my fork and by the time I picked it up, there was a new fork waiting for me.  But of course, we must discuss the menu.  after a little bit of champagne the hostess led us to a wonderful table overlooking the Belaggio Fountains.   We began with Les Amuses Bouches which led to the appetizer, Warm Foie Gras, Black Pepper Pears, Sauternes, Smoked Bacon. Delicious, wished there was more. Bread was great too.  we had the:  1) Roasted Farm Raised Chicken, Verjus, Fines Herbs - not a big fan 2)Venison Chop, Oatmeal Cake, Chanterelle Mushrooms, Huckleberry Reduction - Delicious. Loved how the venison was prepared. 3)Braised Short Ribs, Buttered Egg Noodles, Roasted Vegetables - To die fo 4) Aged New York Steak, Bone Marrow, Cabernet Reduction - a great cut and made to perfection  with Brussels Sprouts, Chestnuts, Bacon - a nice accompaniment.   For desert:   we each had our own souffle's. you didn't expect to share? Get the chocolate and Pistachio. We really liked the Petit Fours too.  Definitely come here on your next visit to Vegas.",

His description of the fillet when I asked about how it comes, \"It's literally a piece of meat on a plate\", didn't sound very appetizing. When he asked if I wanted a side of potatoes, he never even told me how they would come.

We had 2 different foie gras dishes both excellent. But my favorite was the brulee stuffed French toast....wow so so good. And of course our server was friendly and attentive.    But I'd really like to mention our first trip there that was for dinner years ago.  It was me and my wife's first trip to Vegas together. I decided on Eiffel because I thought it would be romantic.....and it is by far one of the most romantic restaurants in Las Vegas with a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains across the street.  Food and service was outstanding.  I still remember the duck (two ways) dish I had....  haven't had a better duck dish to this day.    Our experience there was so amazing that it started our culinary romance with Las Vegas. It inspired us to venture out and try a new restaurant every time we returned. So thank you chefs and staff at the Eiffel Tower!     Their are so many great restaurants in this town and I think the big celebrity chef ones get the most attention.  But do yourself a favor and check out the Eiffel Tower for brunch, lunch or dinner!    We promise not to wait so long to return!",

The star of the show: Filet Mignon with foie gras, wild mushroom, and the amazing dessert Nutella and Pistachio souffle.   We also ordered the warm lobster appetizer, Alaskan wild cod with cauliflower cous cous, slow roasted Atlantic salmon and baked herb crepe. These were okay and I probably wouldn't order it again.   It's pricey but I would definitely come back!",

The restaurant has its own entrance to the tower. Now I have to admit, you probably so much more for the view itself here. We were sat at the \"back end\" of the restaurant but I thought the views were just as great here. We started off with the auld fashioned. The french take on old fashioned. My wife ordered a paris affair. Really satisfying drink. We ordered the King steal filet, medium; came out more well done, so I was like ok about it. We tried the rack of lamb, bomb! Ordered a side of the mashed potatoes, so creamy. Our server was amazing, I forgot to get his name. Nice long beard.   Amazing drinks, 5 star service all around. The food itself was just as good, our server was great. It's really pricey but like I said you pay for the views and experience. Recommend it if you want a view to die for and great service. I will return at a future date.",

    "text": "Bonjour Paris without the flight. This is by far the most elegant, upscale dining experience in Las Vegas. I came here in mid April on a work event trip and I am super fortunate to experience this treat. You are truly paying for the memory, from the moment you ride the private elevator up the tower, when the door opens and you arrive into the kitchen, are greeted right away and escorted to the gracious hostess who has been expecting your arrival. Most of the tables against the windows are reserved for couples facing the views of the Bellagio water fountains, the strip, and the sunset skies. If it is a special event, birthday, proposal, or anniversary they have the very popular reserved corner window table for an extra fee and special menu with personal photographer package. The larger tables and group table seating are still spectacular with beautiful views.   The service is magnificent. Our bread server, Ruben was awesome and Heather our server was marvelous. Never did we have to flag them down for something however at the same time left us alone and the timing was spot on. They also have a floating photographer lady who offers to take photos of your party then simply adds it to your bill and the photos are uploaded to your phone right away.   The menu was not extensive and was right to the point. They gave us complimentary avocado soup, a choice of 4 breads with butter (you can have more than one), and were offered water. I began with a glass Pinot Grigio Terlato which was perfection. For starters, I chose the Non-Traditional Caesar Salad with warm anchovies, capers with a Garlic Vinaigrette which surprisingly was larger than I expected. I also tried the Slow Braised Smoked Pork Belly that was divine. When we first arrived, a lady was leaving and said we needed to try their escargot, \"its to die for\", so I ordered the escargot, however, it was an off menu item for dinner and the kitchen agreed to make it for us. It blew my expectations away-this was probably the best escargot I have ever had. It is very rich and full of flavor in a savory sauce, not to be missed. For the main entree, this is a place where you have to order everything separately, it does not come on one plate. I was in the mood for The Queen Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon (cooked medium) accompanied by the Brown Butter Roasted Asparagus and the Olive Oil Mashed Potatoes. The flavors are heavenly and everything was plated so alluring. The other appetizers and entrees looked amazing as well.   Save room for dessert they say, it will be amazing they say, try the souffle they say. The Souffle au Grand Marnier was the winner for me. Every spoon full was exquisite. Finally, finished with a glass of Port. This was definitely the icing on the cake.   The lady's room was lovely, with a powder room, extra seating to touch up your makeup, relax, and there was a sweet restroom attendant with all the goodies in case you forgot something. As you leave, there is a glass case with items you can purchase that say Eiffel Tower on them. Overall, I had a wonderful experience here. It's nice to know you do not have to just come to dinner, you can also dine here for a casual lunch, or just sit at their beautiful bar area, anytime you chose, you will not be disappointed.",

(Oops i meant the Vegas strip)   Our server was humorous & attentive. What more could we ask for? Started off w/ Brut & were served French & multigrain bread. Both great.   We all ordered the Queen (petite) Filet as it was a late dinner. I had mine medium rare and paired it with the Lemon butter. It was a tad over cooked but didn't feel like sending it back especially being my bday our itinerary was full. It was still enjoyable.  Sides:  Brussel Sprouts: crispy  Asparagus: good  Classic Gratin Potatoes: tasty crisp and smooth v delicious & rich.  Mashed potatoes: I didn't particularly enjoy",

    "text": "One of our finest dining experiences ever.  You know when you order a simple dish like chicken and the skin tastes like it was cooked by Chef Joho, your in for a treat!  We make a reservation 2 weeks before my wife's birthday. We also did a walk up the day before to check on our reservation and to make sure we had a window seat. They told us all reservations made for 430 is guaranteed a window seat. We expected a small crowd at 430 and low and behold, it's a packed house already!!   We were the 3rd/4th couple seated and we got a prime seat overlooking the Bellagio fountains.  My wife got their signature Eiffel Affair Tower drink and I had a couple of their margaritas. The bartender makes some mean drinks.   My wife saw the lobster in some previous yelp reviews and just had to have it.  Baked 1 1/2 Pound Maine Lobster, Herb Crust, Spinach Florentine It's 79 dollars and worth every penny. She said hands down the best lobster she's had in Vegas. The presentation was awesome. She didnt want to eat it, just take photos of it :)  I heard the chicken was really good and tried they. I normally go for the steak but Opted for the chicken this time out.  Half Roasted Free Range Chicken Two Ways, Wild Rice, Root Vegetables The skin, I know we are talking about the skin here but it was to die for. Not sure how they cook it but it was perfect. The only complaint is that it was slightly salty. The rest of the chicken was perfect!  For the sides we got the Gratinee Creamed Spinach and Mushroom Classic Potato Gratin  Both were delicious and a wonderful compliment to our dinners.   For Dessert we had the White Chocolate Banana Elysee and wow this thing is a work of art! Not only did it look good but it tasted good as well!  We also go the photo combo which cost $40.00 this included digital prints and a photo in an album. It was very nice. They charge it to your bill.  Our wonderful experience cost just over $300.00. I highly recomend it. My total reward points paid for the entire meal!",

They started us with a little taste of a cold parsnip puree soup topped with fried sage. Deciduous! Two of us had the BLT Tower & the other dish ordered was a burger with blue cheese. The BLT was excellent. It was made with bacon bread! It was basically 2 sandwiches cut in half & stacked on top of each other. I'd split it with someone the next time. The burger was huge too & equally delicious. To finish off the meal they brought out little tastes of candy to try. Perfect ending!",

In fact, I enjoyed it more that Jules Verne in the real Eiffel Tower!  The room is beautiful, and the view of the Strip and the Bellagio fountain can't be beat. The atmosphere is sophisticated without being stuck up.   The lunch menu offers a nice assortment of French-inspired cuisine focusing on the lighter side. I loved the torchon appetizer and my Ocean Seafood Salad (btw, what other kind of seafood is there?)  The frozen souffle was an interesting dessert. Try ordering a glass of Amaro and pouring into the ice cream at the bottom--delicious!  The wine list is decent, and the prices normal for the Strip.  This is one of the few Vegas restaurants I think is worth a return visit, because it is about more than just the novelty of the experience.",

    "text": "Was I surprised? You bet.  I don't like to have too high expectations when it comes to places that already have good Yelp reviews because I have experienced not so great food that does not reflect the stars.  I LOVED THIS RESTAURANT.   If you follow me you know that I have been to many places in Las Vegas and Eiffel Tower instantly shoot up to the top of my list of high end dining places.   The orders:   1) Seared Scallops $26 - Two chunky sweet scallops. They were good with a great sear on them. They came quickly and were just a tad warm. The onions were not great, too chewy and mostly cold, so I only ate the scallops.   2) Muscovy Duck Breast $49 - DIOS MIO. This dish probably changed duck for me forever. I think only half the time I order duck it is good. Eiffel made this dish the gold standard in duck. The breast was juicy, tender and medium rare. The skin was crispy with just the right amount of fat in between. Each bite went amazing with the blood orange sauce. Everyone at the table thought the same. A MUST ORDER.  3) Individual Eiffel Tower Beef Wellington $68 - HANDS DOWN the most incredible and most perfect Wellington ever. Gordon Ramsay's does not hold a candle to this one (I tried the one at Hell's Kitchen and GR Steak). Beyond tender, beyond flavorful beef medallion with simply the most skilled made puff pastry ever seen. Non mushy, crispy and delicious. Ridiculous.   4) Baked 1 1/2 pound Maine Lobster $79 - Really good lobster, a bit too much spinach florentine but good lobster. IN a few words, Treat yo sef.   5) Classic Potato Gratin - Yes. The way it should be. Well seasoned (usually the come too salty but not this one). In a cast iron skilled, hot and creamy with potatoes that hold their shape. Perfect.   6) We also ordered in advance 2 SOUFFLES! Chocolate and pistachio. Of the two, the chocolate was the tastiest one. Both incredibly delicate, perfect for sharing. They will not make you feel heavy or otherwise. A must order as well.   Service was very good. The only thing I did not like was the bread service where they bring a big basket of bread and they ask you which one you want. Obviously, I want them all! So I had to ask the wait staff for the bread man to come by again. The breads were fresh but not hot. That would be my only complaint.   Will definitely recommend this over most of the other fancy restaurants for a special occasion. Highly recommended to make reservations (will need a credit card to hold it, and they charge $50 per person who doesn't show up which is a bit ridiculous)",

I made a reservation for 4:30pm online as that will guarantee us a window seat. We got seated in front of the Bellagio fountains and it was a beautiful sight!  Food and service was impeccable.  We got their tasting menu and loved the foie gras.  If you feel like splurging, tasting caviar here gives you an elaborate experience as it comes with gold spoons and all the fancy little toppings and bread.  We loved our dinner and it was a great night to remember.  Highly recommend to anyone that wants a romantic dinner date!",

    "text": "We had a pretty amazing dinner here for Thanksgiving. At first they seated us way at the back of the restaurant, with no view of the strip, but we asked for a different table and got moved to a prime spot, very close to the windows overlooking the strip! With a 4:30pm reservation, we also got a beautiful view of the sunset behind the strip.   FYI most of the tables right AT the windows are two tops. There are a couple of four tops, but you can't 'reserve' those (we tried. Plus we had a stroller, so we knew that would be hard). It's hard to get a photo right at the window with a view of the strip, so if you see any that are empty, take advantage of the chance to snap a few pictures!  I also love that right when you get off the elevator, you get a full view of the kitchen (no window or anything!). It is spotless and everyone works together like a well-oiled machine.   RESERVATIONS: Made about a week in advance, in person. My mom was walking through the Paris Casino and randomly was asked if she'd like a tour of the Eiffel Tower Restaurant (normally you need to pay if you're not dining there). She was so impressed that she made our Thanksgiving reservation there after the tour!  THE SERVICE: Fantastic. Our server (Konstant, I believe, based on our receipt) was incredibly professional and at the same time warm and friendly. He chatted with us but didn't linger, and was very patient with us and gave great recommendations.   THE COST: My main reason for not giving this restaurant 5 stars - it is very expensive! Dinner for four, plus a $140 bottle of wine, came to $600 total including tax/tip.   MUST-HAVES: Sauteed Foie Gras (appetizer), Rack of Lamb, Souffle (many flavors available - I liked my pistachio!).   THE FOOD:  AMUSE BOUCHE * Pureed Turnip with bacon and caramelized turnip - 3.5 stars Interesting, a nice way to start the meal!  COCKTAILS * Pomegranate Cocktail - 2 stars Our server recommended this when I asked for something light and refreshing. I found this to be too strong and not very complex in flavor. I sent this back, which was absolutely no issue.  APPETIZERS * Sauteed Foie Gras ($29) - 5 stars I've never had sauteed foie (only the torchon/terrine style), and apparently this is the more traditional way of serving it. I took one bite and it was like heaven in my mouth! It seemed to just melt away into a fantastic plethora of flavors. It is a bit much, quite intense and heavy, so if you don't love foie, this may not be for you!  MEATS/FOWL * Roasted Rack of Lamb ($64) - 5 stars Delicious, perfectly seasoned, light pink in the middle, tender meat, slightly charred in just the right places. Just super pricey!  * Muscovy Duck Breast ($49) - 4 stars Very good, and the blood orange sauce was great with this! Duck was a little tougher than I would have preferred.  DESSERT * Souffle ($16) - 4.5 stars Wonderful - heavenly soft, spongy cake. Fantastic with the sauce poured in. We tried pistachio and pumpkin, I liked the pistachio slightly more!   * Cappuccino - 3 stars Lots of good foam, but the coffee was just ok underneath.   THANKSGIVING MENU ($79pp) * First Course: Butternut Squash Soup - 3.5 stars My mom loved this, but I thought it was just fine. A little light on flavor, but a nice thick texture.  * Main Course: Turkey - 2.5 stars They did a nice job incorporating all the Thanksgiving classics into one plate, but it just wasn't up to par for such an otherwise fantastic restaurant. The turkey, potato, brussel sprouts, cranberry all were homemade-level quality.  * Dessert Course: Pecan Pie - 3.5 stars Good, a classic!",

    "text": "After dining at the real Eiffel Tower in Paris, we decided to go here for thanksgiving this year. We had been one other time a few years ago so it was long overdue that we dine here again.   The elevator to the restaurant is in the middle of the Paris and it's lit up in red so it's not hard to find. The elevator opens right up to the kitchen of the restaurant where you're greeted and brought to the front to check in. We arrived about 25 minutes before our reservation time but were still able to get seated immediately. I requested a window but we didn't get one. The place was pretty full and it was thanksgiving so it's understandable.   The view overlooks the Bellagio Fountains and is so pleasant. Our waitress was so welcoming and helpful. We were able to choose from the regular menu or the special thanksgiving menu. They also have a children's menu which I wish I had known beforehand. Then my daughter wouldn't have enjoyed Jack In the Box prior to our meal. Instead of the children's menu, she happily filled up on baguettes and a Shirley temple.   We order from the special thanksgiving menu and chose the butternut squash soup with duck confit. It was so tasty and filling! Next, our main meal came out. Dark and light meat turkey with gratin potatoes, brussel sprouts, braised cabbage, chestnut stuffing and cranberry compote. Every bit of it was amazing but my favorite thing was the stuffing. It was so perfect and not mushy. It actually had chunks of veggies in it, yummy! Lastly, we finished with dessert and both chose the pumpkin Souffle with southern comfort creme anglaise. It was the perfect end to an amazing thanksgiving. The best part was I didn't have to cook or do dishes.   I really like Eiffel Tower Restaurant and it's very good no matter what meal you get. Best view for sure and attentive staff.",

    "text": "One of the things that everyone has to do when coming to Vegas is go on a romantic dinner. The main attraction to this restaurant is the view, and there is a table for two all along the window, so you will get an awesome view of the Bellagio fountains and the strip. There are bigger tables throughout the restaurant, and still has the view of the strip. This is located at the Paris Hotel, across from the Bellagio. The entrance for the restaurant is in the casino lobby, towards the front of the entrance. There will be a hostess on the casino floor where she will direct you to the elevator that will lead you to the restaurant.   We got a table against the window with a great view of the strip. The service was great, and the complimentary bread is amazing. After you order your food, they will serve you fresh bread. They do give one slice at a time, so stack up when they do come by! The French bread was so fresh, and I was already trying to think on how I can take it on the airline back with me.   Rossini Style Filet Mignon, Foie Gras, Truffle Sauce: It was a decent sized filet mignon, with a good slice of foie gras. I have been waiting for this dish since they have banned Foie Gras in Los Angeles. I loved the filet mignon, and the foie gras does go great with it. The entire dish was cooked to perfection and the salty fat from the foie gras with the thick meaty filet. The one thing I was amazed on was the steak because the plate wasn't covered in the juices or blood while I was eating.   Broiled 22oz Bone in Rib eye, Roasted Bone Marrow: The rib eye was a great size for those who are super hungry. It was seared with the bone marrow on top. The Bone Marrow reminded me of the restaurant in LA that I never tried but everyone is raving about. I did learn that I do not like bone narrow at all. The rib eye was one of the best I ever had.   Mashed Potato: We both ordered this as our side. It was light, and was amazingly smooth. I never had such a smooth creamy mash potato before. The one thing I do recommend is the sides are big enough to share for two. So order something else so you can share.   Classic souffle: I could not decide which flavor I wanted, so I had our waiter decide. Plus, I never had souffle before so I figure I would let someone who had it before decide. If you want the souffle, then they recommend that you order as your ordering your food since it does take about 30 minutes. They have variety of flavors from classic, pistachio, chocolate, and grand mariner.   There are two things I have learned from my experience with this restaurant. One is that the main dishes seem to have the fatty to the meat ratio. From my steak with the foie gras, and the rib eye with the bone marrow. The second thing is the price. We did not order any wine, alcohol, or appetizers, and still paid about 300. This is a pricey place, but it is an experience you need to try at least once and the quality is undenialble. It is well known for being a romantic place for a reason. Also, if you pay a fee, which is about 60 I believe, they will give you a dozen roses. So there are tons of packages you can add on to the experience of romance. Also, make sure you make reservations in advance because it does fill up quickly.",

The service is beyond amazing, every single person that works there is very attentive and friendly.  When the food came we were expecting something beyond.  We didn't expected the food came in very small portions (bite size) and even the flavor was really really good I wasn't just impressed.  My favorite time was the Mediterranean Loup and my less favorite was the Foie Grass.  The environment is romantic but also you can go with friends and family.  I liked that our waitress explained every single meal we had just to make sure we were going to enjoy it.  Paying almost 500 dlls for this dinner don't think we will do it again because despite the view we didn't get to see the fireworks.",

Had my timer on to see how long we would wait as it was packed & yet we had reservations.   8:30 hits - we get called. VERY impressed. We were greeted by David right away on our table as we sat. Again, impressive.   Food :  Appetizer - i could skip this. They offered bread so could save you some $$$  Main course -  Rib eye w the bone marrow - cooked perfectly as requested. Husband loved it.  Lamb - cooked the way i liked it. 4 pcs so just decent size. Kids meal salmon - can i just say i LOVED the fact that they have kids meal? Yes we want an upscale dinner but no we wont leave our child home and i LOVE that they do accommodate children.  Chocolate souffle - MUST HAVE. As u all know must oder ahead of time as it takes a while.  Strawberry souffle - my husband wasn't fond of them. Said too sweet (and he has a sweet tooth) will slop next time Complimentary : Ice cream for our little one Anniversary dessert - husband loved it didn't even share. Think it was chocolate mouse   Highly recommend this place. Will def be back. Perfect service from start to end.",

Oh, and let's not for get the small little rolls they serve you before all the food comes - really, really good but those can fill ya up pretty quick, so be careful.

We lucked out and caught the only Bellagio fountain show of the evening - due to high winds.    The only thing that bugged me was that in this classy restaurant, there are still those people who don't even try to dress up a little.  Ripped jeans and a tank top?  Come on.  Don't mind me - that's just a pet peeve of mine.  Dinner was excellent.  Any time there's escargot on the menu, you know it will end up in front of me.  YUM!  Dinner consisted of steak for both of us.  Filet Mignon for me, bone in rib eye for him.  Both were cooked to perfection and topped with potato gratin and sauteed mushrooms.  We were stuffed, but no birthday is complete without dessert.  Somehow we managed to down a Grand Marnier souffle and the apple strudel before rolling ourselves to the casino.",

It really would have been a romantic setting, but I went with my best friend, so we had lots of fun creating dialog for the surrounding tables. We ate at 8:00pm and were starving! Our waiter was a really hilarious gay guy who was totally a queen. At first he was really calm and reserved but when we started cracking jokes with him, he let loose!  It's haute cuisine, so do not expect big portions. You eat there for the experience and the flavor. Our server told us that the Blue Cheese Souffle was a good started and wow, he was right. Its a tiny little thing, perfect for sharing and it was gooey and soooo good with the little salad that was served with it. It was gone in just a few bites.  We both ordered Filet Mignon, but since they serve it two different ways, we each ordered one version and sampled both. I got the red wine sauce and she got the lemon butter. I really can't tell you which is better. They were both wonderful. They both made me close my eyes and shutter. I ordered Asparagus and Gratin Potatoes also and my friend tried the Pommes Dauphines which are fried balls of potato puff. very interesting.   Even though we had absolutely phenomenal food, we were hungry about an hour later and ended up driving through Sonic on our way to the Palm's.",

At the end of the second course, we felt the dinner was moving along too quickly.  I asked the waiter to slow down the pace, and he obliged so we could spend plenty of time taking in the Bellagio fountains at sunset, watching the casinos light up as we stared transfixed at the beauty of Las Vegas and the beauty of each other, quietly holding hands under the table, engaging in fun conversation about us, each other, life, and so many things.    Sometimes a dining experience is positive because the food is excellent (as was the case with the Lamb - wow), but what I strongly recall as I compose this review  a week later is how the meal facilitated a romantic interlude.  It also facilitated a marriage proposal at the table next to us.  I recommend this place even more so for those who are in love or want to fall in love.",

I loved everything about this place, and was so, so, so glad we decided to splurge here on our last night in Vegas. With no Res, we came up the elevator, gave our names and only had to wait about 15 minutes at the bar before we had a seat. The bartender was hilarious & sweet, and the hostess carried our wine over and seated us in a large, plush booth.   The view = incredible. This place is mid-way up the faux Eiffel Tower, facing the Bellagio - so we got to see the water show more than a few times while we ate.   The food = even more incredible. We started off with the Blue Cheese Souffle Pudding, Walnut Pecan Petite Salad. Holy god, that was good. For entrees, we had the Aged New York Steak, Braised Celery Heart, Bone Marrow, Cabernet Reduction and the Filet of Sea Bass, Fingerlings, Double Smoked Bacon, Crispy Potato, Petit Mache. Plus, we shared the Potato Gratin. It was all AMAZING. And they aren't messin' around with the portions. Everything was as filling as it was delicious.   To finish off, the special Eiffel Tower Souffles in Chocolate and Raspberry. They take 30 minutes to make, so we had the foresight to order them before our meal and they were just perfect. The waiter does this fancypants thing where he pours the cream and chocolate into them at your table and they get all big & fluffy. mmm. MMMM.   The topper: our *very* French waiter was great! Constantly checked up on us, made funny jokes, and didn't even blink when I spilled water all over the table. In fact, he moved us to another!   All in all - just the best. I would for sure splurge to go here again. It was romantic and beautiful and I left completely satisfied.",

    "text": "My husband and I were celebrating our wedding anniversary with our kids and therefore decided to give this place a try given the high ratings. I must say I was really disappointed. I gave 2 stars just for the views and for the amazingly delicious souffle, which by the way cost $15 each. I was not impressed by the phone manner of the person taking the reservation or the front hostesses. For a restaurant of this caliber, I would expect more courteous attitude. What I don't get is that I called 45 minutes before my dinner reservation time to see if I can move it up 1/2 hour. What I get in response is that they cannot change my reservation but I am welcome to arrive earlier to see if they would sit me. What kind of response is that? You either tell me that no tables were available or change my time. Upscale restaurants would not let their patrons wait if they have a reservation. We ended up arriving 10 minutes earlier, and even though I see a lot of empty tables, the hostess asked us to step aside and said we were early and that they would sit us at exactly 7pm. I was a bit turned off already. I was even more disappointed when even after both reservation taker and the waiter asked if we were celebrating any special occasion and we told them about our anniversary, nothing happened. Most restaurants would do something special with our desserts, but not this one. As for the food, the steak was ok but not worth $59. The lamb chops was good, but the Dover Sole was disappointing. It was pretty hard as I couldn't eat it without cutting it with a knife. At $69, I would expect better. I had it switched to salmon. It was better, but nothing to write home about. The strangest thing is the kids menu. I specifically asked and was told at reservation that there is a kids menu. When we sat down, there was none. I asked the waiter and at first he said that the kind of upscale restaurant that they are they don't really recommend the kids menu. I pressed further and he said the portion is too small for older kids, just for little ones under 5. My kids are 9 and 5. He cannot honestly expect me to order an adult entree for my 5-year-old! I ended up ordering pasta for my little one and the portion was just fine! With the kind of money we spent on this dinner, I could've easily gone to other restaurants in the area that offer better food and service. I just don't get the high ratings from other Yelpers.",

I ordered roast chicken, my wife ordered the duck. My chicken was great, and according to my wife she thought her duck was great also. It is a little pricey but considering the cost of other restaurants like this i believe its comparable. Our bill was less than 100 for two entrees, two desserts and drinks.

It seems that half the value of the meal is on the view (in this case, the Bellagio water show), and it's at the expense of the service or the food.  I was delightfully not disappointed on either count by the Eiffel Tower Restaurant.  Highlight of the evening was our indulgence in a delightful chocolate souflee (order at the beginning of the meal, 30 minutes to prepare).  The wine list is probably too large for your average tourist to comprehend, but our waiter was patient as a trained dog in helping my godmother choose a wine from the list in the dim light.  Their bar also knows how to make a fantastic sidecar with bourbon.  Got me hopped enough to play a spin of roulette (Won $10 on black).  Service was a bit slow in mid-meal, but I give our server high marks in geniality.",

Ambiance:  I would recommend making your reservations between 6-8pm...that way you can enjoy the sunset and the water show with the proper lighting.  We snagged a seat around 7pm right next to the window and were able to enjoy both.  Our waiter, a portly man with a great sense of humor and a \"FURANCH\" accent, was very pleasant and helped set the mood for a night of french cuisine.  Grub:  The steak was \"melt in your mouth\" delicious.  If you go with the filet mignon- medium rare, there is no going wrong.  MMm...we still talk about that steak to this day.  The appetizers left a little more to be desired...we ordered the duck patte.  This was probably not the best choice considering the price.  It was...an acquired taste... one that probably should not have cost so much to be acquired.    Service:  At the end of the night, we were offered dessert and found ourselves too full to order.  However, the waiter returned anyways with a plate of delicious sugar cookies on the house!  That alone deserves a full star.  =)  Price:  Our bill came out to about $195 that night including tip but well worth it in my opinion.  I think on the next shot, we might pass on the appetizers and shoot for the filet mignon only.    All in all:   simply delicious!!!",

All the food was delicious, especially the souffle, but I am a dessert person so that would be my favorite part. The service was the best service we have ever had!

For my wife's 50th Birthday dinner I chose Eiffel Tower and requested a window table-overlooking the Bellagio lagoon- at sunset. When we arrived (early) we we seated exactly where we wanted, enjoyed perfect service and two exceptionally prepared meals. The wine service as very good (as was the list.) We were never rushed and the courses came out in a timely manner. After dinner, our prearranged tickets to the observation deck were included in our bill and provided a wonderful exclamation mark to the evening. I would highly recommend this restaurant for any special occasion or meal for those who want a truly remarkable experience.",

So I called the restaurant & let them know we would be a little late. We got there around 20 minutes late of our said reservation. So we pretty much figured we would not be getting a window seat.   Once we entered the restaurant, we were taken to our table. A corner table next to the Bellagio Fountains. Probably the best seat in the house & much more intimate.   Service was great. They explained everything on their menu, and always made sure we were taken care of.  I had the baked lobster, my bf the chicken, & a pistachio souffle. AMAAAAZING!   What a great place to celebrate a birthday or anniversary.",

This has been on our bucket list for the past several years and we finally made the splurge for our anniversary.  Overlooking all of the bright lights of the Las Vegas strip, you get to enjoy some real fine dining that the Paris has to offer.  We had two of our dear friends join us for dinner who also happen to be very good business colleagues.  Visiting us all the way from Pittsburgh we wanted to show them a great time.  This place did not disappoint.  From the minute we sat down, we were greeted with a really nice and comfortable red velvet booth overlooking the strip.  We ordered drinks, which were very excellent by the way; the Pink Velvet and Can Can.  Definitely a sweet and sour type of alcoholic drink made to perfection.  My only gripe was that the drink was served in a champagne glass instead of a larger cocktail type glass.  Still a good drink to definitely start the buzz for the night.  Our entrees consisted of the Free Range Chicken and the Imperial Beef Wellington.  Both excellent meals and I did not leave the plate empty at all.  I told the server I was concerned with the beef wellingtons having some pink, but it did not.  Was served medium well and certainly did not disappoint.  It also came with a red blood looking sauce (I forgot the name), but it really enhanced all of the savory flavors.  I will definitely be coming back here to try the multi-course meal; apparently all parties in the group must order it.  Great excuse to come back.  Excellent place for cozy, quiet and romantic evenings.  Be prepared to spend $125-$150 per person, but well worth it.",

Most of the seats are geared to give a good view- so already a hit with the ambiance, right off the bat. We walked in on a Thursday night without a reservation, and even though they were busy, we got seated within 5 minutes. The food was also really amazing. It's French (go figure), and upscale. Service was great too (I ordered a drink and didn't like it, they replaced it with a good wine instead) and very attentive.  We got the scallop appetizer, while admittedly it was small, it was delicious and perfectly seasoned and seared. We each got an entree- and neither disappointed.  Next time I visit Vegas, I'll be sure to come here again!",

The evening was very nice, great drinks, views and food and we sat the table we requested.  Had good communications with the reservation staff.  Enjly the food and the water show.  Our waitress did come to our table to check on the service but the way she spoke to us was very unplesant.  She couldn't understand the request and kept talking down to us.  I asked for the refill of my diet coke, and waited for over 10 minutes to asked her again to see where is my drink.  I got the reponse as the following:\"Did you just order your drink?  Then you need to wait a little.\".  When I ecplaned to her that I ordered the drink 40 minutes ago and requested to get the refill about 10 minutes ago.  She couldn't understand and told me that I can't rush the order.  Also when she asked us if we need any thing for the first course, I answered\"every thing is fine\".  With a very disrespectful tone she said:\" I was asking if you need any thing.\"  We decided not to let her service effect to our dinner because rest of the staff were really nice to us.  We walked away with the smile on our face.  The waitress just didn't add the great image to the restaurnat, I hope the manager can be awared.  A good restaurant is not just about the food and view, with out the respectful service, a perfect dinning experenice can be destroied.  I hope in the near future, I can put the missing star back.",

You definitely want a table with the view of the bellagio fountains, and while I was just there with my husband, there were lots of groups which seemed to be having fun. This place is quite expensive so just be aware. My husband and I are in our 20s but came to Vegas prepared to spend money! We spent close to $350 though (with a bottle of wine) and unless you are really holding back, I don't think a couple could get out of there for much less. It's Vegas so everything is relative.

    "text": "A Beautiful Evening.  I took my parents while we were visiting Vegas.  They love cheesy tourist stuff and I wanted to treat them to a nice meal.  Well, it wasn't as cheesy as I expected.  As soon as we stepped into the dining room, I felt like we were floating above The Strip.  The dining room is dark so the lights of Vegas looked amazing all around us.  The service was top notch and the food was fabulous.  It's probably the best view in Vegas.  The best tables are in the front of the dining room right next to the windows facing the Bellagio fountain, but we didn't get those tables because most of those tables are for 2 ppl and we had 3.  Larger 4 ppl tables are behind those.  So if you want the best view, it's probably best to go as a couple.  However, even from our table at the side of the restaurant, we were able to enjoy the Bellagio fountain shows and also get a great view down the strip.  I could see Aria, NYNY, Excalibur, and Luxor from where I was sitting!  We all had the $89 pre-fiix Tasting Menu and it was worth it.  Every course was melt in your mouth yum.  (6 courses including dessert)  Here's the Tasting Menu:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eiffeltowerrestaurant.com%2Fimages%2Feiffel%2Fpdfs%2Fmenus%2Ftasting.pdf&s=3e87296954623d604acaca3ed005cd2e3863ce5f33c345e16f3a6b9a3a19df31\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">eiffeltowerrestaurant.co...</a> It's really the best deal since you get a bit of lobster, halibut, and lamb.  I'm not a huge lamb fan, but their lamb was great!  The tasting menu had smaller portions, but I was stuffed by the end of the meal.  We also dished out an additional $6 each to get the Souffle instead of the regular dessert.  Again, totally worth it.  We each got a different flavor and sampled each others: Pistachio, Grand Marnier, and Chocolate..  All were beautifully sweet and fluffy but with their own personalities.  Definitely don't miss out on the Souffle.  The bar looked like a good alternative if you don't want to spend the $$ on dinner.  But once you see the view, you might want to send the whole evening there.",

We were promptly greeted and taken to our table for two -- literally looking out at the Bellagio fountains. It was the best view on the strip!!   Our meal started with sparkling water and an amuse bouche of a tiny parmesan cheese puff pastry. A perfect little bite indeed!! I ordered the warm lobster, braised leeks and celery appetizer. The sauce was rich and delicious, the lobster was delicate but boldly flavorful. It was perfectly seasoned. My wife ordered the blue cheese souffle pudding with a walnut pecan salad. She loved it. Loved it like she wanted to lick the plate clean loved it. Loved it like I had get a little pushy to try a bite loved it.   For an entree I ordered the duck prepared two ways--a sliced breast served medium-rare and a leg confit with wild rice and a rich sauce. Every bite was tender and juicy. My wife ordered the slow roasted filet of salmon with a pinot noir sauce. She said it was the best salmon she had ever tasted. We opted for a side of the pommes dauphines which were essentially mashed potato filled tater tots. Awesome. Every bit of our meal was amazing. We sipped on their signature cocktail the Eiffel Affair and ordered souffles for dessert. I went with the chocolate souffle and my wife had the grand marnier souffle. Both were delicious. Each came with a sauce (mine had a chocolate and a creme anglaise sauce). Probably the best dessert I've ever had. Thank you Eiffel Tower for making my belated honeymoon dinner worth it.",

    "text": "The view was great and the food was just ok. Me, my husband and 2 other friends were graving for souffle on a Sunday afternoon, so we were thinking we should find a restaurant somewhere in the Paris hotel that had it. We walked by the entrance of the The Eiffel Tower Restaurant and a guy asked us to check out their brunch menu. So we especially asked him if they have dessert souffle and pasta in brunch, then he said \"yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.\" We were all excited to have a good brunch.  We ordered Eiffel Tower classic hamburger, Light omelette souffle topped w/ asparagus and brie, also some french toasts. When my friend was trying to order pasta, our server was so rude by answering \"Pasta and spaghetti are Italian while this is a French restaurant.\" Then we were thinking why the hack they have hamburger, isn't it Germany cuisine? And then my friend asked him, if we could order dessert souffle, he said they don't have time to prepare for the lunch period. But that's what we've told and that's the main purpose of us decided to come into this restaurant. What can we do? We were disappointed, but we still had to stay.   Appetizer: instead of having regular bread, they served us an amuse bouche of some kind of parfait, it was delicious.   Hamburger: it tasted alright but very juicy  Omelette souffle: texture was just like an overcooked steam egg  French toasts: it tasted ok  The price is reasonable, the whole meal costs around $60. I will recommend to go for dinner but not brunch.",

The view was spectacular and the restaurant is glamorous.  We had the best service.  We ordered the pairing, where we get different wines for each course.  But since we had a 4 hour drive, we opted for no wine.  The food was wonderful.   My appetizer was Warmed seasoned shrimp over a light sauce.  My boyfriend had the spinach and mushroom strudel.  He said it just melted in his mouth.  My shrimp was delicious.  His main course was a smoked salmon over egg omelet with crunchy potato strings and capers.     I had the marinated steak over potatoes with poached egg.  OMG  the flavors were fantastic.  We thought heaven had come to earth.   Our dessert was a souffle with grand marniere   along with a topping of strawberry ice cream with diced pistachios and fresh strawberries.  It all was great.  Please visit this wonderful place.",

This place is fine dining at its finest. The service was amazing. The host who greeted us once the elevator doors opened was a nice touch. The waiter was fantastic, very attentive, very friendly. He remembered to bring out a birthday dessert without me having to remind him. The support staff came by several times to check on us, offer us bread, etc., and never let our water glasses get less than half full. I appreciated the supervisor, Lyle, coming by to check on us, and his thank you email after the fact was a nice touch.   I had the New York Steak, my girlfriend had the chicken, both were delicious. The pistachio souffle was to die for.   It was pricey, to be sure, but you get what you pay for.

    "text": "OMG AMAZING!!!  My friend Sarah and I came here to celebrate her birthday on Christmas Eve.  Sarah had made the reservations a few weeks prior for I believe around 5:30ish, well since the sun had been going down earlier here in Las Vegas, the restaurant contacted us and asked if we would like to move our reservation up to 4:30 that way we can enjoy the sunset while we were enjoying dinner.  SERIOUSLY?! WOW!!!  I felt that was one of the best things a restaurant could even consider, I have never had anyone worry that we might miss the sunset, we were extremely happy and took the 4:30 reservation.  The wine was excellent, the appetizers were amazing, the salmon was delicious, the service was the best I had ever experienced on the strip!    Even the fellow patrons were a delight, minus the woman sitting next to me yelling at her child because she herself did not know how to operate a digital camera and was trying to take a photo of the sunsetting but was too daft as to turn the flash off, she then complained that the rather clean window was disgustingly dirty and that is why she could not get a good pic, um, no it is because you have your flash on and are trying to take a photo in front of a window LOL But I am not faulting anyone for her stupidity.   The only issue I have is they have a rather \"strict\" dress code, which i am fine, I just decided to wear my tux as we were going out afterwards and it is always nice to dress up, we were both informed that it is \"Business Attire\" fine, spectacular, and as we are leaving we share an elevator with people carrying To - Go containers while dressed in kind of filthy blue jeans and long sleeved t-shrits.  Why put on your website and inform us over the phone that it is \"Business Attire\" only if you are allowing people to eat there in jeans?   Over all it was an amazing experience, i would definitely recommend eating while the sun is setting as well!!",

We had the pre-fixe dinner menu which was about $90/person and included amuse bouche, appetizer, entree, and a dessert.  I can't remember everything we ate here but both of us still remember the venison chop with huckleberry reduction sauce and ginger mojito.  Those were some of the best things we ever ate/drank.  The venison was super tender and huckleberry reduction was excellent.  Ginger mojito was the best mojito we ever had.  We both loved the ginger foam at the top.    The service was very professional but somewhat stiff, almost corporate.  Place looks upscale and romantic.  Most of the couples were seated by the window where you can get a nice view of the Bellagio water show.  You definitely need to dress up to dine here.  The decor can be a hit or miss depending on lighting and time of day.  During night it looks quite spectacular, but during the day, it may look like a typical gaudy Vegas decor.",

You take an elevator up and the views are fabulous. It was very impressive!  The food is just melt-in-your-mouth amazing, the service is top notch without being stuffy, and they really went above and beyond to make it a very special night. We were continually brought bread, waters refilled, and even given a great tasting cauliflower soup (sounds a little weird but tasted awesome), compliments of the chef. The food was delicious and the service was exceptional. The waitress was so on top of her game, it was probably the best service we ever had. She was great, yet wasn't stuffy -- she was very personable and made us feel comfortable. When my mom made the reservations, she asked them to include roses on the table. They had a dozen of the most beautiful red roses ever -- they are seriously perfect and still thriving! I got to take them home in the vase, and the waitress provided a great gift bag to make carrying them out easier. The are full and open, still looking and smelling as beautiful today as they did this past weekend at the restaurant! She also brought out a birthday dessert, in addition to the delicious souffle that my mom loved. My mom also asked them to bring out a jewelry gift she had gotten me, with dessert -- they brought it out on a platter and had written Happy Birthday on the plate. They didn't skimp on anything here -- everything was fabulous! It was the greatest dining experience and they helped my mom make my birthday truly special and unforgettable!",

I ordered a glass of wine (that definitely costed more than double what the bottle would've), my husband ordered a \"French lemonade\" non-alcoholic, we had a middle of the range appetizer,  I ordered Filet mignon and my husband ordered beef wellington....our bill at the end of the night was $285!!!!!!!!@@@$$&#% totally not worth it! I would look for something different if you're looking for someplace nice to eat! There are plenty of other views out there!",

    "text": "Random info: Tasting Menu is $125, Wine paring optional, additional $79. Average individual entree ranges between $50~$80. The elevator to the restaurant is located in the middle of the Paris casino.   Ambiance: Excellent. In terms of view of the Bellagio fountain this is probably the best place to dine! (Be sure to ask for a good table if you come here for the view ;).)   Food: Good. The first time I came here with my girlfriend we had lamp chop and a steak. I thought those dishes were quite average. The second time I came here with my clients, and we had the chief's tasting menu which I thought it was definitely one of the better tasting menu I had come across. The Foie Gras, which is duck liver was amazing!   Parking: Good. Free parking if you don't mind the walking. On the other hand valet is only $3~5 bucks depends on how much you want to tip. I always valet when I'm in Vegas it is so freaking convenient!   Service: Excellent. First of all there are people greet you right at the elevator, and will escort you to the restaurant. If you are having the tasting menu, your utensils will be swapped out for clean ones after every course. And oh, beware they have restroom attendants, be sure to bring some cash for tips. Water is always filled on time, sometimes the VP/manager will walk around and personally make sure everything is ok.   Conclusion: Hands down one of the best view in Vegas! Good food. Over the top service. A good place to impress a date/client. Dinner for two, expect the bill to be $200 if you order off the menu. $280 ~ $450 if you are getting the tasting menu.",

I had the New York streak cooked to perfection (Medium Well), and my GF had the roasted chicken which was also yummy, great thing about a relationship is sharing food. The sides were also good! It was a lil pricy, but worth the experience! They even offer to take your pic with a great background, and frame a 5x7 for $25. Glad my GF not only suggested it, but picked up the tab!

    "text": "When my boyfriend asked me if I liked French, I immediately assumed we'd be dining at Bouchon. But then he mentioned a spectacular view and I remembered the actual Eiffel Tower in Paris has a restaurant in the middle of it.   It's quite a walk (especially in stilettos!) from the parking lot past the buffet and through the Paris casino to the elevator which will take you up to the restaurant.    We arrived uncharacteristically late (8:30 for our 8:15 reservation). Because we specifically wanted a window seat (which I HIGHLY recommend), we ended up waiting over an hour. Around 9:45, the hostess let us know that 7 tables had signed their checks and they were just waiting for them to leave.   First up, the gazpacho amuse bouche was flavorful and refreshing. Oddly, someone walks around with bread (which I suppose is a good thing if you don't want to fill up on it). I preferred the baguette to the multi-grain. We also ordered two glasses of cabernet based on our waiter, Tom's, suggestion.   We started with a summer salad with shaved vegetables and corn soup. I felt the salad was overdressed and yes, there were literally paper thin slices of vegetables. They brought over my soup bowl and poured the liquid contents into the bowl tableside. Fancy. It was supposed to have manila clams but I couldn't really taste it although I am always happy to be served bacon.   For entrees, the boyfriend ordered steak and bone marrow while I had the rack of lamb, cooked medium. Both were succulent and perfectly cooked and definitely worth the wait. The staff apologized for the long wait. Since the kitchen was slammed, our entrees didn't come out until nearly 10:30.   We ended the meal with a Grand Marnier souffle (they have 6 kinds), which you have to order at the beginning of the meal. Afterwards, they brought out petite fours. Yum.   Although the soup and salad were forgettable, the entrees were amazing and perfectly cooked. What was most impressive was the view. We were seated by the window where it directly faces the Bellagio water show. Easily the best seat in the house. Saw quite a few brides (2-3) at this super romantic venue. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "A small group of us had brunch here on a recent trip at the suggestion of a friend. The day we visited was my birthday, which we informed the hostess of when we made reservations the day before. The entire staff, throughout the reservation process the day before through the meal the following morning, was very courteous.   We were seated in a rounded booth that faced the Bellagio, which was ideal for me as I find the building to be beautiful and of course there are the fountains. From our seats, it was easier to see the fountains when they were shooting higher - the views from the small tables that line the windows look to be amazing. I was a little disappointed that halfway through the meal, shades were drawn halfway over the windows and thus limited our view.  We had anticipated the prix fixe menu ($39/pp), before realizing there was also regular menu options. I opted for the french toast, which was listed in the menu as having a vanilla cream, bananas, and pecans. Upon its arrival, there was bacon (actually, pancetta as I was informed) resting on it. I informed our server that I am a vegetarian, and had my only unpleasant moment during this experience -- while he took the dish back to have it corrected, I was not given an apology of any kind but merely told \"that's the pancetta\". This item was not listed in the description on the menu, so I did not know when ordering to request that it not be included.  The food itself was good, after being corrected. I also opted to have the warm apple dessert, which we were told needed to be ordered in advance due to preparation time. This came out a little more crisp than I would have normally preferred, but overall it was a good dessert. In addition to this, I was given a small chocolate dessert for my birthday. As a chocolate lover, I found this to be very good and especially enjoyed the chocolate slice that topped it.  Overall, I really enjoyed this restaurant and would return on a future trip so long as the menu still contains items I find appetizing. I would be more careful when ordering to ensure that the option does not contain any kind of meat, however.   As a final thought, they sell a few items including cookbooks and chocolate bars. As I raved about the chocolate slice on my dessert, my brother purchased a chocolate bar for me. I wish I could say that this was the same chocolate, but will admit that the purchased bar is very good as well -- it is a dark chocolate bar with sea salt. As someone who doesn't care much for salt, I find the combination in this bar to pair very well.",

    "text": "The spectacular view of the Bellagio fountains is the real selling point here ... honestly, I found the food good but not great and pretty overpriced.  Service, however, is excellent, and the general atmosphere is of a \"special\" event.  I've been here before for Sunday brunch ... and if you time that right, you can see the fountains when they're running during the day on the weekends.  I really enjoyed that meal (about a year ago, I guess) and the prices weren't too outrageous.  They don't offer the souffle for dessert during the day, however, and since I REALLY wanted to try it based on the many rave reviews, we decided to come for dinner.  When booking, I saw that if you book a 5:00 or 5:15 table, you are guaranteed a window table overlooking the fountains.  We had a show to get to anyway, so that sounded good to me.  However, our window table was off to one side, so the view of the fountains wasn't that great ... and one of us was pretty much pointed away from them entirely with no view at all to speak of.  Appetizers -- corn chowder with lobster custard ($18) was way too sweet.  Had to add lots of salt to make it palatable.  Far better was the Roquefort souffle ($16), a small dome of light and fluffy blue cheese and eggs paired with a small green salad.    Entrees -- crispy-skinned arctic char with smoked beets ($46) was on the small side, but the fish filets were moist and tasty ... the plate also featured a foam emulsion that was surprisingly bland considering it was made with horseradish.  The beef wellington ($68 -- ouch) was a filet atop a layer of mushrooms and pate, all individually wrapped up in puff pastry.  A small pitcher of rich red wine reduction came alongside, as well as a pile of limp snow peas that looked like they'd been scooped out of a buffet chafing dish and plopped on the plate.  The meat was a shade overcooked, but still very tasty, especially with that sauce.  However, I could easily reproduce this meal at home for $10 with no advanced chef skills required. I find that annoying.  I don't mind paying high prices when magic is being done in the kitchen, magic I could never work myself.  This was not one of those meals.  And so, time for the souffle (not sure of the price ... $18?).  We chose pistachio to share, and it was okay, but not over-the-moon fantastic.  It tasted very strongly of amaretto instead of pistachio.  If I had it to do over again, I'd go with the chocolate instead.  End of the night, with drinks, tax, and tip, we spent about $235.  Meh.  I wouldn't do it again.  I MIGHT, however, return for daytime brunch.",

He forgot to bring a jacket and apparently this restaurant likes to keep that \"high class\" feel going. They even lent him a jacket to wear for the entire dinner. I find that somewhat funny but at least they didn't turn him away right?  Looking at the menu, it took me back when I was at the Space Needle for dinner. Everything sounded so amazing yet so pricey! I can admit it, I can be fairly cheap sometimes BUT I do however think amazing foods come at a fair price.  With that said.. I order the roasted rabbit, no appetizer or salad. They served us asparagus soup  and bread to begin with so I didn't want to stuff my face too much. Gotta save room for dessert! Having rabbit is new to me and as much as I wanted lamb I also like to try new things even more so. The meat was so delicate, much more so than lamb but just as delicious. With the sauce and vegetables served along the rabbit, everything fell into place. My mouth certainly was having a taste bud orgasm.  For dessert, I ordered the pistachio souffle which our server had informed us about in the beginning since it takes about 45 minutes to prepare. Souffle? Yum. Pistachio? YES PLEASE! So how was it you ask? Blissful. I was literally in heaven. Subtle sweet gooeyness and fluffiness... Oh, and it was humongous! I probably could have devoured it all by myself but I was nice enough to share since there was definitely more than enough.  Exceptional service of course. Our server was very friendly and informative. The ambiance is very intimate with an outstanding view of the water fountains at The Bellagio. It was a nice experience and worth it but man was I happy to take off my heels after wards! The strip is not friendly to feet in heels at all.",

FOR GREAT JUSTICE.  service was friendly and fast.  the view out on the Strip is tough to beat, especially when you see the Bellagio fountains going off. worth it.",

There were a couple of things on there that I really didn't want to try, so our waitress was very quick to switch them out for other dishes.  It was expensive, but totally worth it.

    "text": "THREE STARS, FOR A GREAT BAR  NEGATIVE TWO, FOR DINNER SERVICE THAT BLEW  Hubby and I made reservations for our dinner here a day early. We drooled over the menu and called his parents for suggestions on what to eat.  The following day was spent walking around Vegas, drinking, and eating! We unfortunately planned very poorly and had booked two other things this day: a late lunch and bar show at Kahunaville (prepaid on Groupon) and a naughty (X)Burlesque show to end the night . A 7:30 dinner was stuck right in between the two with not much room on either side.   We arrived on time and were told to wait at the bar where we ordered a drink from Keith. We actually each ordered a bottle of Hell's Keep ($22.70) and he suggested we share the beer because the bottle was a little bigger than normal and we didn't have a long wait. Perfect - and yummy!  With sadness we looked over our menus and realized we'd have to get something smaller than we planned since we'd eaten not long before and had to hustle a little for the 10 pm show (we were told to be there no later than 9).  We wanted to be upfront with our server and told him we would be ordering apps and dessert instead of complete entrees. Since we were at a window seat he said that we would probably have to move to another table near the bar. I understood, since seating is the nicest so they want to give it to the people spending the most, but the WAY he said it was not pleasant. Even though we were allowed to stay in the seats, his attitude the entire meal left a bad taste.   What we ordered: Warm caesar salad ($16.00) Blue cheese souffle ($16.00) Creme Brulee ($12.00)  We both agreed the salad was the best of the three. The dressing was fantastic. The souffle wasn't bad either but we found a much better creme brulee another night at Centercut in Flamingo.  Honestly, we really enjoyed the view and the water show from Bellagio, but when I'm spending $50 on an appetizer and dessert I'd like some class from the staff. We should have just moved to the bar area as soon as he first said it.",

I read mixed reviews so we were hoping for the best. Overall I really enjoyed the experience. We were sat at a table by the window. It was a Sunday night around 7:30 and was somewhat busy. Atmosphere is louder than I expected. I had 3 pieces of bread because I was worried the portions would be small. We ordered the scallops for appetizer. They were the best scallops I've ever had. I was trying to discretely get all the sauce from the plate! We ordered the pork chop and rabbit with two potato dishes on the side. One was mashed and I can't remember the other. Portions were bigger than I thought and I was pleasantly surprised. Waiter was nice and explained the menu and didn't make me feel dumb for asking what certain dishes are. We had a great experience which lasted about 2 hours. I think they intentionally take their time so you can enjoy the view. We had a souffle which was alright. Overall the food was really good and the view was great. If you have the money it's worth a try!",

The bread, amuse, and dessert were a nice touch, and the VIEW was second to none. I can only imagine what the view is like from the REAL eiffel tower and I would predict that this is better ONLY because of the Bellagio fountains.   The only thing I wished they would do is pipe the music from the fountain show into the restaurant. (Because it's the music WITH the fountains that make it so exquisite.)",

    "text": "\"Spring\" Restaurant Week 2013 finally gave me the opportunity to check out le faux Tour Eiffel. In my OpenTable reservation, I mentioned RW and the fact that I would like a seat overlooking the Bellagio fountains.  Silly me. The fountains don't start up until 3pm. We did get our window seat, at least. Though I didn't check out the other side, I'm happy our table was along the window angled toward Bellagio, Cosmopolitan, and the Paris balloon. The view was so enjoyable, we didn't miss the fountains at all.  I suppose I should talk about the food. In a word, it was outstanding. They started us out with the amuse-bouche of the day. It was some sort of sunchoke mousse and it certainly amused my bouche. But the star of the meal for me was the beet salad. Easily the best beet salad I've ever had, the RW menu description reads, \"Spring Greens, Smoked Candy Striped, Red And Golden Beets, Fromage Blanc.\" Delicieux!  Not wanting to turn this into a novel, the main course (\"Sauteed Veal Medallion, Green Pea Mousseline, Wild Forest Mushrooms\") and dessert (\"Mixed Berry Pudding, Strawberry, Blueberry, Raspberry, Framboise, Creme Fraiche\") were also fantastic. Wait a second. Framboise means raspberry. Redundant!  The wonderful setting and the fabulous food would be diminished if the service wasn't also impeccable. Our waiter knew we were there for RW and he was very knowledgeable about our meal. I chose to do the $16 wine pairing and I enjoyed his tidbit about Willamette Valley being the same latitude as the best pinot regions in France. Sure made that glass of vin taste just that much better. It was also a nice finishing touch as he brought out a selection of chocolates and candy. My choice of passion fruit jelly was delectable.  Having been to la vraie Tour Eiffel, I've been skeptical about visiting the Vegas version. But this restaurant, with its romantic window tables, has made me a believer. I look forward to returning for dinner with the Bellagio fountains in full force.",

We had to go see a show and sadly didn't have time to wait for the souffle. We had the chocolate cake which definitely hit the spot.   Our bill was just over $200 for a cocktail, a glass of wine, two salads, two entrees and one shared dessert. Absolutely worth the splurge. We didn't get to enjoy the view as we sat inside but it was for sure one of my favorite dining experiences in Vegas.",

    "text": "French Restaurant or Dinner Theatre? I have been coming to Eiffel tower restaurant on and off ever since they open. And I can see the changes and it is not all good.  If you go right at opening , around 5pm you can score a table around the window facing the Bellagio fountain, those are mostly table for two. These tables use to be regular rectangular table with the two seat facing each other, as formal dinning should be. After all, you are dining with the other person, so facing each other will be more romantic and better for conversation. Now the table is a semicircle table butting up against the window with the two diner both facing the window. As a result, more tables against the window can be place, ( the space for the two seat are now eliminated). The bad or the good, is now you can ignore each other while dining and just pay attention to the fountain belonging to Bellagio.  Now the service related to this seating. Now the server or the table cleaner have to put his or her arm right between you to do their duty. Again it can be good or bad. Bad when you are having a romantic time and all of a sudden an arm appear between you two at eye level totally disrupting the conversation or moment.  Server at top restaurant will observe you and wait for a breaking moment before they interrupt with their duty, not here. They are the boss not you.  If your want a leisure French dinner, like having a drink and appetizer before deciding on the rest of your dinner,-- like we used to do in this Eiffel Tower restaurant. Forget it. They want you out of there as soon as possible, like a dinner theatre.  They want you to order the entire dinner at once, -- that is what the chef wants -- according to the server. What about what we the paying customer wants?  So you like to be dazzled by the fountain at Bellagio and not so much on the food and enjoyment, this is the place for you.   This place used to be the pinnacle of enjoyment in Las Vegas, you got the feeling that once you are in, you will be taken care of to the best of their ability, like visiting someone house.   No more, it is just grap your money and run. It almost feel like the owner wants to get as money as possible at the shortest time possible before calling going away.",

I'd read a few reviews saying the service or food had missed the mark but we went on a busy Saturday night and still had a window seat to view the Bellagio water show. They only take window seat reservations at the 430 seating but we lucked out. We ordered the Escargot which was delicious, the Butternut Squash soup with Duck and a Beet Salad. The flavor of the soup with the Duck in it was incredible.  For our  main course we ordered the Beef Wellington that was worth the price and seasoned and cooked to perfection.  The pistachio souffle for dessert was huge and went down easily even though we were stuffed. I'd love to return here someday.",

Decided last minute to get dessert/drinks here so we could enjoy a nice view of the Bellagio water show without having to pay a lot for dinner. This place does not disappoint! Guys must wear a collared shirt and pants, but they provide that for you if you don't have any. You check in at the bottom and by the time you get off the elevator to the restaurant, someone is waiting there with clothes for you to change into. We sat in the bar area where it's first come, first serve seating. There are 4 seats in this area that have amazing views of the Bellagio water show. There weren't a lot of people at the bar on a Tuesday night, so we got this prime seating pretty easily. If you want a panoramic view and don't mind a pricey dinner, make a reservation in the corner window spots. We got the chocolate souffle, which took about 25 minutes to make, but was delicious and worth the wait! I expected the high prices, but I was a little shocked when my coffee turned up on the bill as $7 and wasn't anything special or even that great. That was my one complaint but everything else, including the service, was fantastic!",

We reserved a Window table for 2 and the experience of dining facing the Bellagio and the timely fountains was absolutely fantastic. One of the best places for a Romantic dinner date. It felt royal sipping wine watching the Bellagio fountains on a Sunday night. Service was prompt and good. There was a 20min waiting time though we had a reservation. People usually spend 60-90 minutes easily at this restaurant.  The restaurant has unique view of the Strip, Bellagio Fountains from a height and view of the public on the Las Vegas blvd. The window tables are smaller in space and closer to others so you over hear peoples's conversations, but they have a spectacular view which gets you lost in you own world. The official photographs are just about OK for a $25 price. We ordered Salmon Entree and it was good but less in quantity. The wild mushroom and Chicken entree were great.  water/sparkling water are overpriced- blame the spectacular view.",

    "text": "My fiance and I often go on culinary adventures and have so all over the United States and in other countries. San Francisco, Tahoe, LA, Denver,  Belize, Mexico, the list goes on. Street food, fine dining, we love to eat and will try it all. I don't believe I'm a food snob, but I certainly feel that my pallet recognizes a good meal and quality ingredients when I have them.   We had heard this restaurant would be fantastic...that while expensive, the ambiance, dishes, and drinks would be worth the cost. $360 later for two people, I was both underwhelmed and disappointed. Save yourself the cash and dine elsewhere off the strip. We had a $50 Dim sun meal the very next day that blew this one out of the water. (Yum Cha, btw)  Our experience at the Paris Eiffel Tower was as follows:  Cocktails:  wine w/ tar tar  wine w/ ceasar salad  wine w/ pork entree and new york with peppercorn sauce, creamed spinach and potatoes a gratin  Dessert  With reservations we were promptly seated and had a very nice spot, but we were about 12\" from couples next to us on either side.  We started with a sazerac and a bulleit old fashioned. I had expected a decent crushed and brandied cherry, and whole muddled sugar cubes, but my $22 drink arrived with a cheap, formaldehyde-filled neon, red cherry and tasted just okay.   We like to move through the menu, perusing and choosing as we go...but were told we had to order all at once. \"That's how it works here\" reported our waitress. Fine, okay, can do.   I had barely finished 2 sips of my cocktail before our wine, tar tar and bread arrived. I immediately had to ask the waitress to slow down, please. The request was met with a curt response and our wine and tartar sat untouched in the 6pm sunlight for easily 10 minutes before we were ready for it... A dish meant to be served cold as was the pinot (cool, not room temp). This seemed like a rookie screw up on her part. Can't help but feel service should be impeccable in comparison to cost of food. Also, wine pours were closer to 4-5oz. Not a standard 6 oz pour. At $22/glass, you'd think you'd get a full pour for a Russian River Pinot. Not exactly a rare vintage or anything. Despite timing and temperature of food, the tartar with the truffle oil was easily my favorite part of our entire meal. It was quite tastey.  After the tartar, we moved on to the ceasar. It was okay. Not much in the way of anchovie chunks as I had hoped for. No fresh parmesan offered, not warm though advertised that way on the menu.  My last portion of the meal was a pan seared, $64, a la carte, new york. Had requested med-rare. It came medium. Peppercorn sauce on the side was flavorless and overly peppery. Usually these sauces tend to be creamy and made with cognac. This was just a cream based sauce with green peppercorn. Again, just okay. The au gratin was also suprisingly flavorless, so was the creamed spinach. I honestly found my fiance's pork tenderloin dish to be much more palatable with interesting textures and flavors. Though small in size, I would have gladly traded places with him. The pork was decent but the portion of meat was only approximately 5 oz at most.  Lastly, we finished the meal with desert. Two days ago and I can't honestly tell you what it was, I don't remember. That memorable.   Stopped to use restroom on the way out. Powder room attendant was distracted and chatting away on her phone. So much for that.   Overall, I was perturbed at the experience. Thank goodness for my positive and lively dinner date. Time spent with him makes any dinner more enjoyable. Our wallet wouldn't have agreed and at that price, I would have expected a more memorable and positive experience.   TLDR: Eat elsewhere, have enjoyed WAY better meals at other steak houses for much less. You aren't paying for the food, you're paying for the ambiance. If you'd like a great view, this is it, however dishes, food, and service are sub par. Just, Meh.",

I regret coming here again. made reservation, showed up 10 min early, they made us seat 7 wait 20 min after our reservation time, but I saw lot of empty tables, I don't like that part where restaurant make you wait..  & wait & wait. what's the point..Food was mostly good, aside my steak, was really chewy & not cooked. (if you're charging me $85  for steak it better be top shelf)   On the plus side the view is really cool, but I'm not paying $$$$ for that experience again.",

    "text": "All around lovely and elegant.   The Eiffel Tower restaurant is a wonderful place to come for a beautiful and fancy dinner, but my favorite time to come is actually for lunch. It is casual during the lunch hour so you don't need to dress up, Their mid day menu is lighter yet still has fancy options as well; I recommend the stacked BLT which is a site to behold, and the burger. The bread and butter is incredible, and the mini dessert favors they bring at the end of your meal are exquisite. You cannot beat the views, and if you are lucky enough to be there when the Bellgio fountains are performing it is pretty special. This is an excellent place for a romance or a fun family memory, make sure to get your picture taken at the top!",

A glass of wine was somewhat pricey. Overall, the food is delicious, the view amazing, and one of the coolest bathroom that I've seen in the strip with its couch!",

Keep in mind the Bellagio fountains don't usually begin until 3 pm on weekdays.   Food:  - Creamy French Onion Soup: has the consistency of potato leek soup, but tastes just like the traditional French Onion. Was a little salty, and was very rich. Felt pretty full after it.   - Filet of Trout: really phenomenal. The fish was cooked perfectly and came apart easily. The skin was the perfect amount of crispiness, and I was impressed that this texture was maintained even though the skin side faced down on the plate. Came with delicious wild rice that complimented the flavor of the fish.   - Creme brulee: really creamy, not too sweet; great presentation as it came with a beautiful crepe fan.   Atmosphere: Upscale vibe without being stuffy; has the Eiffel Tower detailing. Great view of the Bellagio and the Strip. Bar in the center of the restaurant.   Service: Really friendly and attentive. Good details like great bread at the beginning and a choice of bonbon before you leave.",

And even though the proposal didn't happen until we were at the top of the Eiffel Tower, the lead up to it from the restaurant was absolutely above and beyond.  First, I only mentioned that was going to propose to her sometime that day and they went ahead and put us at the most impressive table in the restaurant. (Corner table, facing the fountains) And the staff was just so accommodating and they were all very hands on. Everyone from the host at the bottom to the maitre'd who made us feel extremely welcome up until the end.   Our server was Arianna D. She was informative, very professional, warm and patient with us. She made sure all the aspects of our meal was perfect.  My napkins was even folded for me when I went to the bathroom. That's good training and its the small details that differentiates restaurants and separates them above the rest. Our server assistant was Paul and he was extremely attentive and checked on us regularly.  He made sure not a single crumb was left on the table between courses.  Our maitre'd for the day was Carmella and she was very warm and informative up until the very end. She even let us know and talked to us about the cook book that was left at the front of the restaurant.  My lady had the Eggs Benedict and I had the NY strip and they were both cooked to perfection. So so so so so good!  And lastly when I called to get the names of everyone involved it was Diana on the phone who was so polite and professional with her assistance in finding out the information for me.  We are definitely going to make this location a tradition for us. And whatever you folks are doing at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant is clearly working! Keep up the fantastic, stellar, performance! Bravo! And even though I did not actually propose to her in the restaurant, it will forever tied to the perfect moment either one of us and our family members will ever forget. We cannot wait to go back!",

    "text": "Definitely make reservations.  Some people say you have to make reservations months in advance, but I managed to get reservations for 7pm on a Thursday in August by doing it online the night before.  Be warned, they do require a credit card for a deposit, and they will charge you $100 if you do not show up.    This place is very popular, and it's popular for a reason.  The atmosphere is awesome, amazing views, and absolutely SUPERB service.  Yes, it is expensive, but they really deliver on the WOW factor.  It's very classy.  If you can score it, you should try and get a reservation near the windows overlooking the Bellagio fountains.  I've seen them from street level several times, but seeing them from above is really cool, and makes for an extra special evening.  The waiters know everything about all of their wines, beers, and each and every menu item.  They can describe each menu item, how it is prepared, and even offer suggestions.  The entrees do not include any sides, so they are ordered a la carte ($12) but they are a decent size, so order two of them and share.  Vegetable and Quinoa Wellington, Tomato and Heirloom Basil Coulis - it was ok, but I should have opted for a meat option at a place like this, instead of vegetarian option. You gotta live a little, right?  The Broiled 16 oz Ribeye with Roasted Bone Marrow is also an excellent choice.  One of the most flavorful, well marbled (but not full of fat and gristle) ribeyes I have ever tasted in my life.  It was a perfect cut of meat, and cooked perfectly, as requested.  Our sides were the  Brown Butter Roasted Asparagus, Parsley, Egg, and the Classic Potato Gratin.  The potato gratin was the best of the two sides - I recommend it.  If you order it and don't think it's the best you have ever had, I will happily refund your money. ;-)  Final note - it seems that the management reads the Yelp reviews on a regular basis, so I want to give a shout out to our server, Will S.  The food was awesome and I had no complaints, but without his superb service, patience, and knowledge of every menu item, this review might not have received five stars.  I really hope you relay this message to Will.  The service is definitely five stars at this place.",

There's just something about being treated well and having great customer service on top of that amazing view and that impressive menu.  Our server Anthony was very welcoming,  helpful,  attentive and professional.   Every time he came by, he had a warm smile and was incredibly pleasant.     We decided to order drinks that we haven't had before.  So we ordered Paris Paloma and Eiffel Affair.   They were both good.   Paris Paloma came with berries in the drink and a spoon on the side to eat the fruit.  It was pretty much a Sangria.   A great Sangria that is!    After couple of nibbles, we were ready for more drinks.  I got my typical Pink Velvet (my absolute favorite here!) and my husband got a bottle of Stella.   Market Greens was a delicious salad that we shared.  I loved the presentation and plating.    My Rossini Filet Mignon was tender, delicious and cooked perfectly for my taste.  Definitely something I will order again!  My husband loved his Vegetables Wellington.   He completely cleared his plate.  That's impressive as he rarely does that.  We ordered Potato Gratin to share and it was delicious as always!  Once again,  we were too full to order dessert.   But Anthony brought over a chocolate mouse birthday plate for my husband and a little tastings plate of delicious little sweet bites.  If you've never been to this restaurant,  do yourself a favor and plan it into your next Vegas trip.  Make sure to make reservations ahead as it does fill up.    It's one of those experiences where you dress up and have great service which makes you feel great.  It's definitely a must do when in Vegas.",

Arrived at the restaurant at 8:30 PM on a Thursday and got seated right away! (YAY) My boyfriend and I were lucky because we got seated near the window, overlooking the Bellagio fountains. FYI, being seated near the window is first come first serve. :P   Food: We've received a complimentary cucumber appetizer (not sure what the name was) which was a refreshing way to start our meals. We had ordered the gratinee creamed spinach, mushroom and lobster bisque which were both great appetizers and full of flavor.   Entrees, I order the individual Eiffel tower beef wellington, sauteed snap peas and it was top notch. The crust on the outside of the steak was heaven and the steak on the inside was juicy and well flavored. (Drools!) As for the boyfriend, he ordered the baked 1 1/2 pound Maine lobster, herb crust, spinach Florentine which was the prettiest and biggest lobster I have ever seen. Not only was it pleasant to look at but it was chewy and tasty as well.   As for dessert, we received a complimentary chocolate dessert and on the plate, they wrote happy anniversary. That was such a lovely surprise. Our server also recommended other desserts and when he mentioned souffle and pistachio, I knew I had to get it! (Please note that it takes approximately 20 minutes to make). Hands down the best souffle I had ever tasted. So light, delicate, and tastes like you're eating a cloud!!   Ambiance: Walked into a room with dimmed light setting perfect for romantic dates. What made it more special were the lit lights on the strip and the famous Bellagio fountains across the street. The size of the restaurant was decent. Loved the red interior, made the restaurant look classy and edgy.  Service: Our server was nice and informative. The only complaint I had is the lack of communication we had when we wanted our food to go. We only ate half our meals hoping to take the rest to go, but when we asked for our check and our leftovers he told us he had tossed our food away. :( Be sure to let your server know if you would like your food to go. This is why I had to dock a star.",

I love sitting at the bar and conversing with other patrons while watching the beautiful Bellagio fountains. The bartenders are absolutely fantastic and their service is absolutely top notch and flawless. Ridge, in particular, was absolutely amazing! I forget the other gentleman's name from 7/29 but I think his name is Matt (so sorry I can't remember)? He was excellent as well and on 7/30 Cory was working with Ridge at the bar and he was excellent as well. Actually, on 7/30 I lost a contact lens. Luckily I found it and Cory was very kind in lending me his eye drops ... lol  Ridge was present both nights and again, he was fantastic! I absolutely loved our conversations and his attention to detail. Because he was simply being himself,  and without knowing it, Ridge helped put me in a better place.   I am very appreciative and grateful for their hospitality and kindness. I'll be back in town 11/29/19 - 12/2/19 and The Eiffel Tower Restaurant is at the top of my list to visit! I'm definitely a customer for life!",

    "text": "Been here twice now and I can honestly say the staff, food and ambiance is truly outstanding here. Had a reservation for 9:30pm. Checked in around 9:15 and immediately were seated. Our view of the strip and the Bellagio fountains were breathtaking.   Maria, (I think that was her name), greeted us and gave us the drink and wine menus. Her assistant, didn't get his name, served us water as we were looking over the menu.   We ordered the Queen Filet Mignon, Brown Butter asparagus and olive oil mashed potatoes. The filet was perfectly cooked medium rare. So tender and mouth watering. The asparagus was tender and al dente and the olive oil mashed potatoes matched perfectly with the meal.   We ended the meal with Pistachio and Grand Mariner souffles. (Order the souffles when you order your food because it takes 30 minutes to make). The souffle were so light and tasted so good. Totally recommend this to finish off your meal.  We paid $239 before tip, so it's not a cheap, but this place is totally worth the price!",

    "text": "First things first, this review is not about the food because unfortunately we didn't have the opportunity try it.   My bf had booked reservations online on Jan 15 for 10pm for May 28th to celebrate our anniversary. He had made them this late because we had tickets to go Celine Dion, and we wanted to be sure we made it. Online it states that you can make a reservation up to 1130pm. On May 18th my bf got a text from the restaurant asking if we would like to move the reservations earlier to 930, to have a table seat. My bf had stated that we were going to see Celine Dion and wanted to make sure we would make it on time before he confirmed. The person who texted him (not sure if it was a manager, owner, event planner), ensured him that it was a 90 minute show and we would make it on time. So he confirmed seeing as the text was confident.   On Tues, while we were watching Celine Dion, we looked down at the time realizing it was 915 and didn't want to miss our reservation. So we left the show early, and later found out that this show does not end until 945 ( so we missed 30 minutes of it). We didn't get out of the hotel until about 930 as my bf was on the phone with this restuarant to inform them we would be about 10 minutes late. After holding for 10 minutes, someone picks up the phone and informs my bf that they weren't seating anymore people after 930. He had reminded them that our original reservation was at 10, and that we would've made it on time to that.  They continued to tell him they weren't seating anyone else and moved our reservation over to another restaurant.   I'm very unhappy with how this situation was handled, seeing as we would've made it to our original reservation. If your plan was to close early, maybe send an email stating that rather then just moving up our reservation time informing us we would've made it. Because of that text, we not only missed eating here but also missed the last half of our show.",

This time around was a much better experience.  Chris was our server and he was so much more pleasant than the server I had previously.  5 Stars for Chris! (I hope that was his name)   Food:  *Slow Braised Smoked Pork Belly Lyonnaise Style *Baked 1 1/2 Pound Maine Lobster, Herb Crust, Spinach Florentine *The King- Broiled Beef Tenderloin Filet Mignon *Chocolate Souffle  Washed down with a couple of glasses of the Paso Robles Cabernet. (Idk name)  The beef was cooked to perfection and very tender. The pork belly is always a hit and the lobster was out of this world. All these different flavors bursting in my mouth that I loved each bite.   Lastly, we were given the option to have a complimentary photo but I kindly declined. (Minus 1 Star due to the mishap of my previous visit)   Definitely will return again and would highly recommend this beautiful restaurant.",

Highly recommend requesting this table as it's the best view.  The food was very thoughtful and well made.    Warm foie gras with Apple compote was rich and decadent and was complemented well by the sweet tart apples   Avocado and seafood salad.  Such a simple dish but my gosh it is flavorful.  The seafood was light sweet and tender.  Wow!  Must get  Lobster Benedict was the star!  Wow.  Cooked to perfection and perfectly balanced with the creamy hollandaise sauce.    Steak and eggs.  Steak cooked perfectly and super tender.  Melted in my mouth.    Apple strudel was delicious and very big portion. Served with creamy cinnamon ice cream.     Trio of sorbets.  The raspberry and mango were fresh tart and creamy!!!  It was paired with sour cream gelato.  Yes. Sour cream and it tasted like it sounds.  It is interesting but paired well with the sweeter fruit sorbets   We will definitely be back!",

There is no better place to watch the Bellagio Fountain performance than from up here. The best part it's the is no time limit so you can be up there until your ready to head down. The first time I went, I was at the top for over 30 minutes and see the fountain show twice.   If you are thinking of going to this attraction check Groupon first. They often have a deal for tickets. The only feedback I have is the amount of people they allow up at once. They oversell and it can be very crowded.",

    "text": "What an impressive dining experience. I have to be honest, I had my doubts about this place being that I've dined at the actual Eiffel Tower in Paris. My assumption was it would be highly overrated; but it actually turned it to be a memorable night. When entering the tower through the elevator and arrive at the restaurant floor you are faced toward the large opened kitchen layout with many chefs hard at work. Then you walk over to the hostess stand and then sit at the beautiful bar directly next to the hostess and indulge in a cocktail while you await seating. You can't help but notice all of the other patrons dressed to impress and the smooth jazz music playing in the background. The dim lighting sets the mood for all of the couples eagerly waiting to be seated.  My reservation was set at 8:30 pm with a window view of the Bellagio fountain so when it began we would have a minor show while we ate. The view was immaculate, the service was top notch, and the mood of the restaurant was well appreciated.  As we placed our order for dinner with our server we were asked if we would like to put in an order for the souffle for dessert right then because it takes a half hour to prepare. I absolutely love souffles so of course I said yes. There were a couple of different options like Grand Marnier, strawberry, and one other I cannot remember at this moment. I asked for the Grand Marnier souffle. They also provided complimentary bread and butter and for the appetizer we asked for the crab legs. These crab legs were like nothing I've ever tasted. We almost asked for a second crab leg but I thought it may be too much food. We ordered the Bison entree and the rack of lamb entree. I loved my lamb and the bison was well prepared as well. I was randomly asked if I'd like a blanket because it was cold in the restaurant which I agreed to but was surprised it was such an adorable red silky shawl like blanket. I thought that was cute. Finally, the souffle presented itself and I swallowed the souffle like it was about to run away from me. It was gone in a minute and that's not an exaggeration. Loved it all!",

    "text": "Las Vegas is one of my favorite cities in the world, go ahead and judge me. There's nowhere else you can visit New York City, Venice, and Paris in one afternoon, or travel back in time to ancient Rome or Alexandria or medieval England. Sure, it's all fake, including the Eiffel Tower in which this restaurant sits. But you say potato, and I say po-tah-to. This is one of those cases in which I urge you to embrace the cheese and spring for a lovely dinner in this beautiful restaurant. Make sure to arrive early enough to snag one of the window seats so that you can watch the beautiful water show at the Bellagio just across the street as you dine on some of the finest food on the strip.  I've made a point of having a dinner at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant on each of my most recent trips to Vegas, and give it my highest rating. Everything is on point - the location and the views, the insanely attentive and polite waitstaff, and the FOOD. Bread service is complimentary and boasts several varieties and you wait on delectable seafood, steak, and fowl. I've enjoyed The Queen, a scrumptious steak, as well as an outstanding red snapper there. My mother pronounced their roast chicken the best she'd ever had in her life, and y'all, she isn't an easy woman to please.   Most exciting of all are their souffles, which change with the season. Last fall we enjoyed pumpkin, and this summer it was strawberry rhubarb. Both times, it was absolutely divine. Looking forward to my next trip already!",

I have been here 2x now and the food I can honestly say is sub par (this is minus their amazing souffle). It is just not memorable and not worth the $$$.  Service: prompt and friendly. Our serve made our finding experience great. The dining room is quite tight and did not have any space for people to walk through.   Views: the view is amazing, you get the Bellagio fountains  and view of Paris hotel.   Food: our party ordered the rib eye, bone marrow, filet mignon (king and queen) bison and beef Wellington. All the side dishes you order separately. The rib eye was not flavorful and somewhat tough, that's being nice. Rib eye was just not aged. So disappointing. The side dishes were prepared perfectly, mushroom medley, creamed spinach, mashed potatoes and asparagus. The bison was prepared perfectly and was delicious. The filets were mediocre, and lacked flavor. All the entrees were not memorable and was missing flavor. For the price you pay, the food was forgettable.  Desserts: if you come here, you must get one of their souffles!!! This was the most amazing part of dinner. So soft and so amazing!! We also ordered their white chocolate and banana dessert, so good.   Conclusion: we loved the views, the service and the dessert. If we were to come back, we would sit in the bar and order their souffle. Wouldn't dine for dinner again.",

Everything was delicious and that stuffed French was one of the best we've had in a long time. The molten lava cake was perfect and you couldn't beat the view. This restaurant is a must in Vegas.",

    "text": "There are many really great restaurants to choose from in Vegas so when you repeat a restaurant, you know it must be good! This was our second time dining at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant and we were not disappointed. We split the steak tartare for an appetizer. For dinner I had the individual beef Wellington and my husband had the prime aged New York Steak. Both were excellent, though in hindsight I wished I had ordered the salmon (which I had on our last visit) since we also had a red meat appetizer. I wasn't thinking about that when I ordered and was satisfied with my meal, but a little variety on the protein would have been nice, too. We split the spinach side dish and for dessert we had a complimentary chocolate dessert for my birthday and ordered the hazelnut cake which was divine! We also split a bottle of Pinot Noir recommended by our waiter. Very delicious!   I made reservations online and requested a view of the fountains and they were able to satisfy that request. All in all another amazing experience!",

Service was impeccable and very friendly - none of the stuffiness that fancy French places sometimes seem to think adds to the experience.  We were treated to a delicious little creamy corn soup amuse-bouche - ooh lala!  The wine was very good and a nice selection of by-the-glass choices.  We both had the petite filet, and both were excellent.  And we ordered the souffle, which was mouth-watering and timed perfectly to the end of the meal.  The only hiccup was a rather difficult-to-deal-with ceasar salad that we split.  The dressing was okay, but quite oily, and since the romaine was served in the \"traditional\" un-chopped style, it ended up just being a pain.  But overall we were really pleased with the meal and felt it was worth the (very large) bill.",

Or maybe ordering the Venison Medium and having it come out blood red and cold.  Or making reservations three weeks in advance and getting seated facing away from the \"Strip\" overlooking the parking deck in a converted  room  designed for storage but used for dinning.  I was told that they had 700 reservations for the night. My wife had the Lamb, with a side of undercooked Cold tomato ratatouille. We think this is what got us sick. If you want to have a $100 per person dinner, have terrible underprepared food and be put in perhaps the worst seat in a restaurant that promotes it's view and be sick the next day then call the Eiffel Tower Restaurant, they will be happy to accomadate.",

    "text": "Absolutely over overpriced. Food is OK  to decent. CaN'T BE a chef in the kitchen just a lot of cooks is what my taste buds tell me. Quality of meats fish etc is top so you are safe with a steak. However, there is no special touch added to these dishes. Place is not set up to give individual attention before being seated. They have a system that requires a queue check in. Not exactly first class The elevator leaves you in the kitchen. Young women at reception are full of themselves and not very welcoming. I sent back a soup that was supposed to be lobster based. Medium sized bowl was $18; soup was light not tasty and had never been near a lobster. Wine prices are ridiculous, even for LV. A lowly Broully goes for $70+. That's about a 500% markup. The $75 corkage charge guarantees you will pay mucho if you must have wine. This place reminds me fondly of The Jules Verne restaurant in the real Eiffel Tour in Paris. It now has 2 Michelin Stars allowing it to charge high prices. However, the food and service are impeccable at about twice the price of the LV Eiffel. The view of the Seine and Chaillot Palace are stunning. You can see the Bellagio fountains for free at street level or even stay at Bellagio for less than your tab at this Eiffel. Oh: Lest I forget. The service has always been professional here. Why am I not surprised that Michelin has stopped rating Las Vegas restaurants. Walking through the now tacky Paris Hotel is not a great appetizer either.",

    "text": "Two of my favorite reviewers, Blair B. & Elizabeth L., checked in with 5-star reviews of this joint, so against my natural impulse to RUN...RUN FARRRR AWAY from this place considering its cheese-tacular setting and it's in the Paris, which is just a gotawful hotel, (with albeit a really good Double Deck Blackjack pit) I decided to give it the ol' college try.  Hmmm. Niiiiiiice.  How do I put this?  The Eiffel Tower Restaurant is like that girl you knew in college that you'd see across the auditorium in PoliSci 103 that didn't really look 'all that' from afar so you didn't pay much attention to her.  That is, until your pal tells you that she was at the kegger the other night that you missed to study for your Stats final and it turns out she's kinda cool but deliberately hides her face in class, wears a Chargers jersey on the weekends, and can down 5 shots of Patron faster than that chick Marion from 'Raiders'.    So you check her out just for yuks and you discover that she's actually immensely cool, really smart - heck, she's acing the class - on top of being about a solid '9' & you realize you've been a total dick for pre-judging her and wasting your time not getting to know her better.  But by then your sophomore year's over and she transfers to another UC, changes her digits, and you never see her again.  Ever!   DAMMMMMMMMIT!!!  Hmrph.. uh, where was I?  THE FOOD?  THE VIEW? Oh yeah.  Food's good.  And the view's pretty awesome, what with the fountains and strip and all.  Your girl will definitely dig it.  This is classic French cuisine and eating here made me feel like I was cheating on Andre Rochat.   We're eating French here, so you should know that the dishes will be small, right?  And you should go with classic French dishes, right?  Duck 2 Ways, Rack of Lamb, or Venison.  Fois Gras & Escargot.  And so here we go: Duck 2 Ways: 5/5  Rack of Lamb: 5/5 Venison: 4/5 Fois Gras: 5/5 Escargot: 4/5 (\"When in France...\" you eat French food, right?   So who the heck goes to a French restaurant & says, \"I'll have the seabass\"?  Cripes - would you like a bowl of Miso soup with that?)  THE ATMOSPHERE? This is for the most part, a really elegant, classy restaurant with prompt and formal service.  I did notice an interesting theme however - that service quality appeared proportional to one's dress, so consider yourself forewarned.  I came in a sportcoat, dress shirt & slacks.  ....Did you ever wonder why Andre Rochat, famous for his Las Vegas French cuisine, never built an \"Andre's\" or an \"Alize\" in the only French themed hotel in Vegas?  Well, it might have something to do with the LOUD, CLASSLESS JACKASSES & THEIR OFFSPRING THAT PERMEATE THE PARIS HOTEL.  If there's one item that does not belong in any fine dining establishment, it's a HIGH CHAIR. ...I'm sorry, but I really can't ignore this point.  The food is quite good but the environment while I was dining, was downright teeth-grating at times.  I can see why they are enforcing a dress code.  Too bad it's not enough.  CONCLUSION: Focus on the food.  Dodge the tourists, go on the off season, and get to know this beauty of a restaurant.  Lest she disappear, a victim of the Vegas economy and you never get your chance.  4-stars.  ------------------ INSIDER'S HINT:  LAST MINUTE RESERVATIONS The place is the only joint that fills up with reservations at Paris.  If you get in late, and you can't get a reservation by calling into the direct line, go to <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.opentable.com&s=398d735bf96cffe64a6a11b3d7f0c486215cac974c6f01ddf01041ea38c97fa1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">opentable.com</a> and try getting a reservation there.  Eiffel Tower is available on OpenTable which often can get you reservations when none are otherwise available because the restaurant has to \"keep a few seats open\" for the service.",

It was an amazing view. The service was also well above average. Our waiter was great.   As for the food, we got a complimentary flan+braised duck appetizer which was interestingly good. I ordered the roasted pear salad and my wide got the creamy lentil soup. Both were very very good. For our main course we got braised short ribs and beef Wellington. Also some potatoes gratin and their asperigus dish. Each of these were AMAZING. The asparigus was so crisp and fresh, and the potatoes were so creamy and good. The beef dishes were cooked perfectly. We also had some really good wine and champagne.    At the end, we got a complementary shot glass sized chocolate moose and cream dessert. We also ordered an apple strudel and cinnamon ice cream dessert which was really good.   I have to say, this place was amazing. I'd go back in a heartbeat....though it also might have been one of the most expensive meals i've has too. It was worth it though.",

Perfect fo Anniversarries, birthdays any special occassion,  It makes the ocassion very memorable. But i'll make up any excuse to my fiancee just to go back there again.. lols   2.AWESOME SERVICE. Our server paid very much attention to us. Even got a Complimentary Chocolate Dessert from them, the chef put it on a plate and wrote HAppy Anniversarry on the edges of the plate. It was so beautiful. It made us feel so special..  We don't drink and unfortunately they don't serve any unalcoholic drink but we told him we wanted something just for a toast and surely after a few minutes he came back with a couple of flutes, though I dont recall what it was called his effort to get us something they dont serve is outstanding.  Service is FAST too., unlike other fine dining restaurants which takes 30 minutes to get your food done.  3.REASONABLE Price for a fine dining restaurant with a great view. We paid the same thing at Sutro's in SF and Sutro's food wasnt even as good.  4.EXCELLENT FOOD! make sure you try their FOI GRAS with grilled grapes... yummy.., it melts in your mouth.  5.The only thing is that tables are kind of close to one another so you actually hear the conversations from the other tables., But we got one of the best tables right infront of the Bellagio Fountain so were Happy nonetheless..  Would Definitely be back there Again next visit!!! :)",

    "text": "Ah the Eiffel Tower...restaurant.   You make your way up the elevator and are immediately greeted by someone who takes your coat and leads you to your table, or in our case, since we were a bit early, to the bar.  The bar is nice, great view of the city, top shelf.  Once our table was ready, they came for us, transferred our bar tab and took our drinks and us to our cozy table for two, overlooking the fountains.  It's a beautiful view. The fountains go off.  Impressive.  Ordering al la carte is not cheap.  We opted for the tasting menu ($93.00 pp) WITH their optional wine pairing ($69.00 pp)...This is a great DEAL people.  An appetizer and entree would have been almost as much and we had 5 decent courses of beautifully prepared foods, beautifully presented.  Now that said, the wines were decent but not what anyone would call fabulous; although I found their pairing of the seafood bisque with a Oloroso Sherry, right on!  Have you ever seen the show \"Hello Dolly\"?  Remember the waiter scene, waiters doing the waiter dance with trays held over their heads?  While service was prompt and well timed, there was also a frantic feeling of the waiter dance...and those trays, held over their heads, were happening over our heads and close to our back.  A little disconcerting.  But nothing was dropped or dripped on us so that was a good thing.  And remember those fountains at the Bellagio?  Well, those suckers go off every 15 minutes...so after the first few times...it's like sitting in front of a clock.  \"Has it been 15 minutes already?\"  With a large group, or even maybe a new man (or woman) in your life, that may not be noticed so much, but after 23 years of talking, sometimes you just look at the view, over and over.  The food was good, a well thought out menu, nicely, although unevenly presented.  My plate came looking one way, his a bit different.  If you are serving two plates of the same thing side by side, they should look exact replicas of each other...at least at this level of service and presentation.  Denny's...not so much.  LindySez:  It's a nice date night.  Great food, great view, if you have something to talk about after the 6th time the fountains go off or, as in our case, talking about the fountains going off...and great service (see if we had been paying attention to the view, we probably wouldn't have even noticed \"Hello Dolly\" was being played out behind us.",

    "text": "Real date night has proven itself worthy.  So this is what a celebration for a new job feels like?  Dinner at one of the most uppity up places in Las Vegas?  WOW.  I have never been blown away by a dinner like this one before.   First, the restaurant alone sits itself in the sky, practically.  You are greeted downstairs by the hostess and then personally escorted in their triangular elevator to then be greeted again by the maitre de.  Immediately you notice the breathtaking view of the Las Vegas Strip and what is right in front of your eyes is the beautiful Bellagio.  As we were walking in, the water show at the Bellagio had started and I was completely mesmerized.  No matter where you sit in this restaurant, you are guaranteed a spectacular view.    Keep in mind, reservations are a MUST at this restaurant.  Dressing up is a MUST.  And if you decide to book last minute (like we did) then you have to give them a reason why you are celebrating.    We were seated right in front of the restaurant, right in front of the Bellagio and the water show.  We were given the most excellent service by our waiter who delicately explained every plate that came out to \"stimulate our palettes\".  We ordered the \"Le Menu\" special which consisted of 6 courses and 1 choice of dessert.  I won't even go into how delicious the food was especially the dessert (get the souffle! get the souffle!) because if I did I'd be writing a novel for a review.  Just trust me on this one, it is FINE DINING at its' FINEST.  And when you're there you must ask your waiter for the sweetest Pinot Grigio wine they have.  (But be prepared to pay $90 for a bottle) Then again, you get what you pay for so for the wine connoisseur, this is your place as they have over 500 selections of wine.   Be forewarned though,  this is not a place to go to if you're on a budget.  All in all we spent a good $400 for what I can call \"one of the most romantic and best dinners of my life\".  Was it worth it?  Well , when you just won $1600 in roulette the night before I'd say hell yah.  All kidding aside though, even though the dinner was worth as much as a Gucci bag, it was an experience that will never be forgotten.  So yes, it was worth it.",

Disappointed they took fries off the menu, they were my favorite side dish over the years.  Have always had a great view in the past, but this time we got stuck at the worst table in the restaurant overlooking the pool at Paris.  I should have questioned the hostess and asked to wait for another one.  While our service was very friendly and we did order appetizers and dessert, it took a long time for our waiter to get our wine going and we did not get the check until 10:30 (we had a 7:30 reservation).  I still love this place, but was a little disappointed compared to previous visits.  I will be going back next year.",

It was a really cool view and the food/drinks were amazing.  I had the braised short ribs - yum!  Bread was served while waiting via a guy walking around with a huge tray of a variety of breads.  The drinks were to die for.  The pear vodka drink was so good that I tried to replicate it when I got back home.  Service was impecable - they didn't rush you.  We stayed at our table for an after dinner drink which was very enjoyable.  Awesome place...",

Last time, it was special for view, ambiance, food, and service, but now I think we will not be back.  Almost all tables have a view; that is still nice.  I think this place has now taken on much more of a \"tourist trap\" feel.  Waiter was patronizing, overly pushy toward up-selling everything, and seemed to want us to hurry to turn over the table.  We wanted a single app (smoked salmon) for four of us, and he told us it would be small...we had had before, and knew it was enough.  He told us we had to order entire meal at once, rather than taking our time with drinks and appetizer.  He tried to steer each of us to a more expensive plate, insisted we must order sides, and even questioned our wine choices.  My wife's chicken dish was awful, all dry dark meat, poorly-seasoned, and poorly-presented.  Understanding this was not a \"signature\" dish, we still expected quality, but when we commented, the waiter wanted to argue the point; poor form.  Frankly, for the almost $400 we paid, this experience was dismal.  Go for a drink at bar, skip the dinner.",

Ive never had duck this delicious before that now, i want to try duck made from everywhere.  The pan seared one is my favorite its very soft and juicy, it also comes in a dark wine sauce that is great! everything comes a la carte so don't forget to order some sides to compliment your entree. French food seriously has the best sauces.  so if you decide to come eat here, please please order the duck :)",

You have many choices in LV - I have eaten at most of them, but this one consistently serves top quality food.  Great job.  If I had to be picky, I suspect the cappuccino is machine made.  I asked for a wet cappuccino and the waiter looked at me like I had two heads.  When it came it looked like a vending machine cappuccino in a really nice cup.  BUT that's me being picky.

I was a bit perturbed that you can only secure a widow table via a reservation that is at 5:30 or earlier, but luckily we got one nonetheless. And what a table! As far as a date night, you would be hard pressed to find a better table. The service was very attentive and personable, but I had a major hang-up here. Unless something is jumping out at me, I often rely on the server's opinion and suggestions. It always irks me when the server finds the most expensive option (or close to it) to recommend, and that is what happened here at every step. I realize that it just may be the case that the most expensive everything is the best, but I find it rather unlikely and have been to many 'o joints were this is not the case. The scallop appetizer was outstanding, as were the lamb chops. I did not care for either of the sides (mushroom spaetzle & potatoes gratin), but everything else was great. After reading on how many people harped on the price, I was pleasantly surprised with my visit here and would consider it again for a special night out.",

Out the window! Crazy view!  The room is very open and bright like almost like an outdoor cafe. There was ALWAYS a member of the wait staff at our table with something for us.   They have a wide variety of breads they came around with. For starters I had both the foie gras and a salmon plate. Both where fantastic. For the entrees I was able to try the filet mignon and their duck. Both of course...fantastic! Their entree sauces are so tasty and look so pretty.

Having been to this restaurant a few times -- twice on a busy weekend, once on a quiet weekday -- I can tell you I never had poor service here.  The hosts always seem cordial.  The wait staff is always highly attentive and unaffected even during a packed house.  Food-wise, my favorite appetizer is their foie-gras, which is paradoxically delicate and rich.  The entrees I have tried were the filet mignon and the lamb -- both perfectly cooked and seasoned.  I highly recommend this restaurant.",

Okay I suppose I really asked these questions with no real answer.  But the answer should be: Spectacularly romantic.  I went with a dear friend of mine and we had a blast with this sorta creepy but attentive waiter.  It made us miss our significant others dearly, but then made us forget about them when delicious food arrived.  They really thought out the entry as you take the elevator up and walk through the kitchen before arriving at the dining area.  It was great to be able to have a quick glance of the ingeniousness of the people creating our meals.",

    "text": "I remember we came here for July 4.  Anyway, like every reputable restaurant in Vegas, it's expensive as shit, go figure. And like all the rest, the portions are tiny, so get ready to drop half a bill on a meal the size of your fist and if you want wine, go in on it family style.  I ordered the filet and we got a bottle of wine. My friend and I ended up drinking 80% of it and the rest went around the table.  The wine, eh, I don't know anything about wine. It was the cheapest one and it tasted like wine to me, so all good there. I would say the tiny filet was disappointing but I pretty much knew what I was in for, so no big deal there.  The atmosphere was great, as you'd expect. Very nice view. There are some parts of the eiffel support that sort of awkwardly run through the restaurant but we didn't have any issues with them.  So why did I give this place a 4? Sounds like a 3, right? It does so far, to me anyways.  Well, before they give you the meals, they serve the bread. And here, the bread came in the form of these little cheese bread balls.  Hooooly shit, these things were incredible. I'm pretty sure I could subsist entirely on these things. It was like nirvana in my mouth. I'm pretty sure these will be an integral part of my last meal someday, and they're so soft that if I'm 120 and I've lost all my teeth by that time I should still be able to eat them. Rolled in the experienced hands of Chef Boyardee and cooked to a golden brown in what could only be St. Elmo's fire, these cheese balls were the highlight of my eating experience.  Call them and see if you can get the cheese balls to go first. If not, this place is worth eating at once at least.",

Each time we dine here, they set the bar higher and higher for themselves as well as for any other restaurant. The customer service is impeccable, the food is out of this world delicious, and the view can't be beat! An added perk is that Lyle, one of the supervisors who is in charge of the Facebook page, takes extra special care of customers who let him know they'll be visiting the restaurant. Even on a crazy busy holiday, he got us a phenomenal table and took time to personally greet us. WOW. That's all I can say. He made us feel so special, as if we were the most important customers of his day. Each meal we've had here has been memorable and we expect to make many more memories here in the future. Life (and dining) are great at the Eiffel Tower in the L.V. Paris! :)",

That was the best part of our meal, sad to say.  The view was stunning, but the food left us disappointed.  For the price, we expected everything to be excellent.  My drink was the second best part of the meal.  I had the Eiffel Tower (something-or-another.)  It was like a light champagne version of sangria with mixed berries.  My husband had the Beef Wellington, and it was just ok.  I had the filet mignon, and it was tough, dry, and overcooked.  I asked for it medium, so I was really disappointed with it and didn't even finish it.  For a $69 steak, that is not good.  I've had better at Longhorn Steakhouse.  Maybe we ordered the wrong items, but everything should be good at a place like this.",

We made a reservation around sunset thinking it would be extra romantic. We got there on time (5:15pm) and were seated shortly thereafter. Our server was nice but not super friendly but the hostess was very rude and, for a lack of better words, snobby. We were given a window seat which we were happy with but the tables are small and extremely close together so your elbows bump with your neighbor when using utensils which is silly considering that we are both fairly small people. We both ordered a steak; I the New York and my husband the filet, both $59 a piece. I ordered mine medium which arrived VERY well done and my husband ordered his medium-rare which came out medium-well. Only one side of each steak was seasoned and both contained far too much fat for the cuts. The entrees do not include any sides so we shared an order of potatoes Gratin which had no flavor and the consistency if mayonnaise. There was zero opportunity to express our disappointment with our meal since our waiter seemed to disappear after the food was delivered to the table. All in all, the meal wasn't terrible but it was far from what I would have expected from one of the nicest restaurants in the area.",

Like Rick said, it is basically a restaurant in a theme park; but, the food, ambience and service negate all of that. The blue cheese souffle was not as strong as I hoped it would be; but, still good.  I had the lobster thermidor and it seemed that by ordering that I made the waiter very happy.  We were pressed for time to get to a show so we had to skip desert; but, I imagine it would have been delish. When I tried going here about 3 years ago I was wearing all black tennis shoes (Louis Vuitton mind you) and I was told that \"gentlemen are not allowed inside the restaurnt while wearing sneakers.\"",

YES! this restaurant has everything to accomodate their guests.  My friend and I started off with the Romaine Lettuce, Poppy Seed Tuile salad. I ordered the Sauteed Medallions of Veal, Braised Vegetables, Wild Morel Mushrooms and she had the Char Broiled Filet Mignon. I can't recall the exact name of the dessert we ordered but it was an entire plate of mini chocolate desserts - lots of variety and absolute heaven. I can still taste it!

    "text": "My wife and I used to make the Eiffel Tower Restaurant an annual event but we had not been back for a couple of years. I'm glad we decided to go back.  As in the past, the atmosphere is vibrant and polished. I always wear a jacket but there are some without. Business casual is fine. You should expect to spend 2 - 3 hours for dinner here but the server will ask you if you have a show or event to attend later in the evening to help you get out in time. Do make a point to arrive early and have a drink at their bar. The view from bar (and the entire restaurant) is awesome.   Only negative- I was told that we could only get a table at the window facing the Bellagio fountains if we were seated as 2. We were 4 so we settled for a table on the second tier but saw some of the Bellagio show. I was distressed, however, to see some tables for 3 and 4 set up in that first tier to see the Bellagio show as they dinned. I guess I didn't speak to the right person when I made my reservation.  My smoked salmon starter was outstanding. As in our past visits, my wife and I had the filet mignon. And as in the past it is the best filet I have ever had. Instead of going to one of the many steak houses on the strip, save your steak night for Eiffel Tower and order the filet. You will not be disappointed.   Yes, of course, we had to order their famous souffles. We ordered the chocolate with chocolate sauce and, as a twist, chocolate with banana sauce. You cannot order incorrectly whatever flavor you order. Don't worry about the flavor-just order it! Everyone also get a a small tray of sweets to end the meal.  Their wine list is extensive and the sommelier will help you if you are not used to ordering French wines. The service was attentive and knowledgeable.  It is pricey, but worth it. Save this place for you big night out and you will remember it for a long time.  I only go back to restaurants if they earn it. Eiffel Tower Restaurant earns it year after year.",

I love how we got a window seat and how the table and seating makes you face the window but slightly angled so you are facing the person you are with.  The food here is absolutely amazing. Even the bread that they give you, and you get to choose what kind of bread you want. We ordered the Black Pepper Marinated Raw Beef and that was amazing, the texture of the beef and the flavor was delicious and it came with toast.   For entree my boyfriend had the Duck Breast and Duck Leg Confit, and I had the Filet Mignon with Bearnaise sauce. It was one of the best Filet Mignon I ever had, and I really enjoyed the Bearnaise sauce... I pretty much drowned my filet mignon in it....  If you want to get a side, you should definitely try the Classic Potato Gratin. It was soooo delicious, covered in cheese and the potato was soft. It tasted soooo good.  For our dessert we had the Chocolate Souffle, which the server told us that it takes 30 minutes to make so we had to order it when we ordered everything else. The souffle was really good, it was really chocolatey but was not ridiculously sweet. Even my boyfriend who doesn't really like eating chocolate liked it.   This place was really romantic and we had a great view of the Bellagio Fountain. It was just amazing. And they have a photographer that takes your picture and puts it in this pretty frame for $24. Had an amazing night here. Love this place.",

This is no big deal, and can be easily swapped out for water.    However, our waiter took it upon himself to have someone from the kitchen melt milk chocolate and stir it into a glass of milk.  It was the first time, I have seen someone go to such lengths to appease a four year old.  So for this act of excellent service, this place has moved from three to four stars.  The food was good.  My wife got beef wellington, sorry but it didn't hold a candle to Gordon Ramsay's.  I got a well seasoned, nicely accomplanied piece of fish and my daughter took down an indulgent glass of freahly made chocolate delight to accompany her pasta.  The view from this place in spectacular but we weren't seated anywhere near a window, and felt it would be rude to go trapsing through someone else's meal to get a nice look out the window.  The view is apparently so nice, that they have employed a theme park style photographer to snap your pic and send you home with a $30 keepsake.  The fact that the place is accessed through an elevator was just incovenient, the fact that it opened up into a fast paced kitchen was offputting.  If you happen to be at the Paris you have three choices for food in my opinion and in order they are:  Ramsay Mon Ami Eiffel",

For the past 2 years I have been having anxiety and othe problems such as depression and insomnia due to everything and it only got worse this past 2 months. So my kind enough boss paid for my get away to just relax with my boyfriend and get away from it all.   I called to ask if they take emotional support animals because I've needed my dogs for my case. I have a written documentation from my doctor and everything stating that I need them because they are what ive always known and the only thing \"stable\" in my crazy life right mow. I spoke to the manager and he said yes we take service animals. I told him my dogs are not classified as service animal because under the law service animals help the blind, can call for help if there is a heart attack etc. But I do need my dogs with me 24/7. Here in Los Angeles they go everywhere with me even the bathroom when I'm in my own home. So I explained to him that they are emotional support. He said that's fine and had a girl make my reservations.   Well I decided to celebrate my dogs birthday since her birthday is on 11-11 and the dinner was the day before so I explained that I was going to order something for them to eat such as an unseasoned beef patty or something instead of their usual kibbles.   I get a call back immediately saying now I can't have dinner there because I was celebrating my dogs birthday and that i wanted a cake. I was like what I never once said cake and then he said well we don't allow dogs to eat at the table. And I said they are not eating on the table that's disgusting and unsanitary. Then I said they can eat on the floor. And he said not the floor either. So then I said ok well they need dinner but that's fine they won't eat. And he goes on cutting me off saying no I'm canceling ur reservation ur not allowed to come here with your dogs, we only allow seeing eye dogs.   So I'm fine with not eating there but then I asked him can u please tell me why I'm not allowed anymore when I first called and explained to u I'm not blind or handicapped and u were the one that said everything was fine. And he says well when I saw on the reservation that you were having your dogs birthday and u wanted a cake and them to eat, that is not our restaurants policy, I again I told him, no I never requested any cake and I said ey will bot be eating. And then he goes on saying well we only want service dogs. So which one is it? My dogs eating or your only allowed service dog, and he kept cutting me off and yelling at me saying I'm done speaking with u, etc. Definitely the worst service and discrimination against people with a mental illness and discrimination against dogs being fed,",

    "text": "Wanted to try this restaurant at lunch time with the hubby while in Vegas. When you arrive in the Paris Hotel you take a special elevator --inside the hotel--to the restaurant. There was a nice lady and gentlemen by the elevator door that retrieved the restaurant elevator for us. When we made it to the top we were greeted at the hostess stand and immediately seated. Our waiter came by very nonchalantly and handed us the short lunch menu. I asked could we sit in the middle of the restaurant but for some reason they had to fill all of the seats around the edges. What????! The restaurant wasn't even full and it was lunch time. After reviewing the menu, the hubby and I decided that we didn't want anything to eat (nothing looked appealing) but we would stay and have a glass of wine. When I informed the waiter he said we could not sit at the table to just have a drink and we had to go to the bar and he proceeded to retrieve our menus. I had enough of this wanna be restaurant by then and the hubby and I left. I was not impressed.",

For one, the menu is not very French. French toast was on the menu. That turned me off. Really? French toast is NOT French. And the drinks? My friend paid $18 for a supposed drink that was the hot seller. It was a strange fizzy pink liquid with raspberries floating in it. Did not taste good. Gross.  Our server was very quick to leave us. Don't get me wrong, he definitely had a host's personality when he spoke with us... for like 5 seconds! He would dart in and out, just before we finally would form a question in our minds about the food on the menu.  I had the Aged Parmesan Chicken with what looked like canned vegetables & a miserable pile of dry-tasting potatoes gratin. Blah. The only reason the chicken was tasty was because there was AGED parmesan. And it looked like a giant flat pancake on my plate. I paid $24 for something I could make myself.  I hear there's an Eiffel Tower Las Vegas tour. Go on that instead so you can at least check out the view. The food is not worth it.",

We ordered, menu looked great, all the foods I would expect from a French restaurant.    When the dishes came we found them to be very very very small in portion.  Price was not small however.  The dishes were not French, they are some kind of wierd fusion.  As we tried to enjoy our dinner we found the quality of food and preparation to be minimal.   Eiffel also markets itself as having high dress standards, this is laughable.  Seems to be more a marketing gimmick.   My conclusion, for 1/4 of the price (that's a $125 discount for two) you can get more, and better, elsewhere.",

    "text": "I don't know where to start! My girlfriend and I were in Vegas attending the Electric Daisy Carnival which coincided with our 2 year anniversary. Immediately we started looking for the finest restaurants Las Vegas Boulevard had to offer. We tossed around ideas, and drew up a list. The Eiffel Tower restaurant had  fantastic price point that didn't degrade service or quality. Of course we dressed up for the occasion, however I did note that some patrons where wearing beach shorts and t-shirts. Not really the kind of ambiance I'd like when spending around $400 including tip. But alas I dined like royalty and enjoyed my stay. I started off with the Heirloom Tomato, California Burrata, Balsamic Aspic, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil salad. It was beyond words and more than just a salad. The flavors that my palate were introduced to were unbelievable. My lovely girlfriend went with the Warm Maine Lobster, White Wine Braised Baby Leeks, Mustard Vinaigrette  that was sublime. Tender, succulent and bursting with flavor. A Light size portion that is more about taste and saving room for the next course. For my entree I went with the Char Broiled Filet Mignon, Rossini Style, Foie Gras, Truffle Sauce. One of the best meals I've ever had the privilege to enjoy. Definitely worth the $79 it was priced at. Ill include a picture of this wonderful bit of paradise. I was hesitant to try foie gras but my curiosity was rewarded with an delicacy  that is no longer available in Los Angeles. It was cooked to perfection and looked as immaculate as it was delectable. My girlfriend had the Prime Aged Bone-In Ribeye, Caramelized Onions and added the black truffle sauce that complimented it exquisitely. A magnificent slab of meat suitable for a king or queen in this case. Bought some cocktails that seemed overpriced but the craftsmanship put into concocting them is well worth the steep price. The servers go out the way to make you feel comfortable, and for the time that you are there like you were as important as the president. Never did I feel hovered over or stared at as if I didn't belong. My visit was a little less than a year ago and to this day 4/23/2014 I am still raving about it. We are going back to EDC Las Vegas this year and are struggling to find another restaurant to match the Eiffel Tower Restaurant. And the killer view of the fountains and strip is more romantic than can be described. Definitely a meal that will stand out for a long time. Adieu!",

It you don't feel like dropping a lot of $$$ but would still like to experience this gem, just go to the bar area.

Pricey, my dish was $44 for black cod baked in a bag.  My dinner guest had short ribs, pretty small portions for $52.  For these prices, they can do much better with the quality of food in terms of presentation and the taste.  But then again, you are paying for location and view.  I thought it would be super touristy but it wasn't at all that bad.  Probably be more like 2 1/2 stars as opposed to 2.

    "text": "A beautiful experience!  First! You get to take a private elevator up to the restaurant. That's pretty fun, just by itself. When entering the views are breathtaking!   We were sat with a great spot to enjoy the fountain show! Best view! However, it's a small half circle table and just behind us was the service bar, so it wasn't very inviting. It felt quite cramped.   The gentleman who served our bread and water was a lovely man- always a smile! And I loved how he paused when offering my selection of bread to make sure I didn't want to try the other offerings... I did!!! Being polite, I initially asked for one, but because of his nice smile and kind disposition he knew I wanted to try all 3!! They were yummy.  However, Eiffel Tower, with these prices, cold bread and ice cold butter is just not acceptable! Not enticing at all. (I still ate all of the bread :)  We ordered the scallops for an appetizer. They did not disappoint!!! Absolutely delicious!!! Yum and yum!   For dinner we had the filet. We ordered it medium rare. However, because it's such a large cut, the edges were completely well done. For $70- I can't say I was very happy. Still not happy. I've had many filet mignon, so I might advise one to not try it here, unless you like your meat well cooked. Perhaps a butterfly cut might help if your heart is set on it, though.   For dessert we had the chocolate souffle. It was not mind blowing. But it was yummy. They have 8 flavors to choose from!!! So don't get chocolate- branch out and try something fun! Passion fruit would have been fun!   And maybe I'm New School- but I feel like the lady in the restroom who wants a tip for handing you a towel is tacky. I'm not a fan. Who takes their purse to the go to the restroom? And then I feel guilty for washing my hands!!! Those days went out with Breakfast at Tiffany's.  For 3 items and a glass of house wine- the total was $140!!   I'd definitely return to sit at the lovely bar and enjoy the beautiful ambiance and views! Have a drink, maybe the scallops? But the price you pay for the food, just doesn't match the Wow factor - like when I saw the bill!!!",

Perfection a mix of lobster, potato and mushroom.  Then the ribeye with bone marrow.  The marrow was to die for.  Creamy, salty, fatty bliss.  The steak aged and intense in flavor.  The mushroom side dish upped the decadence of the meal.  Finally the best souffle of my life.  A pistachio dream.  Excellent service and amazing view.",

    "text": "I've been coming to Las Vegas ever since I was young, and this was my first time dining at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant. It was an experience I'll never forget!  Made reservations for 8:00 on a Thursday night and was pleasantly surprised to be seated near the window, it was a very romantic spot for my boyfriend and I. The server (Igor, I believe) was funny and attentive. He was on top of things and having him as our waiter was a nice addition to a fantastic evening.   For an appetizer, we ordered the steak taretare, which was amazing. I've had my fair share of taretare, but this one really took the cake. For dinner, I ordered the beef wellington and my boyfriend ordered the veal medallions, both of which were out of this world.   Overall, the food, the view, and the service were all spectacular. I highly recommend this place if you want lasting memories!",

Restaurant does have a dress code so dress appropriately. That being said, boyfriend and I had no idea so they provided him a white collared shirt without any problems and I was not treated with any ounce of disrespect in my t-shirt and jeans.

A very romantic place where we had a window view of the Las Vegas Strip. From the hostess that guided us up the elevator to our waiter--the staff was so helpful and accommodating.  We started off with our regular Hennessy and two seafood platters. The platters included, lobster, crab, oysters and clams. The meat easily came out of the shells. I don't think I have ever had crab meat come out that easy. Very good start to our meal.  The filet mignon was cooked a perfect medium rare and accompanied by a side of (classic) potato gratin.   We finished our dinner with a pumpkin souffle and espressos. A very romantic and enjoyable time. Great food, date and view--what else can you ask for?",

    "text": "We were looking for somewhere to brunch on Sunday. A concierge told us this place had a brunch special of $30.99 for the meal and $12.99 to add unlimited mimosas. This place looks like the Eiffel Tower and the elevator to get in is inside the hotel. There is one elevator to take you up there. As the door opens, you see the kitchen and the chefs cooking. Once we got into the restaurant I knew that the brunch special had to be a mistake. The servers were in professional attire and the tables had linen tablecloths and a boatload of cups and silverware for one person aka fancy. My thoughts were confirmed by the bartender laughing at us when we told him what we came for. At that point my friends and I were tired of looking for a place so we sat at a table. The views were incredible! The food and drinks were extremely expensive. I settled on the brunch special that included three courses for $40. The presentation was amazing for the appetizer and entree but didn't taste that great. The shrimp appetizer really was delicious and brought a whopping two pieces of shrimp. The entree was steak with an interesting wine sauce. It was ok. I guess I should have expected small portion sizes for this kind of place but I was blown away at paying almost $70 for a subpar meal and ONE drink. A MIMOSA WAS $18! yes I know Vegas is expensive but damn! The dessert was gross. I love dessert and it didn't do it for me. It was some sort of frozen fluffy yogurt. I don't know how to describe it. I probably would not go back to this place.",

We're more of a budget friendly kind of people and we decided that we deserved one REALLY good dinner and cost wouldn't be an issue. It was the most expensive dinner we've ever had. We wanted to find something that was the whole package and at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant that's exactly what we got. The ambiance was perfect. It was soooo intimate , romantic, and personal, you almost forget that there's a bunch more people there. There is noise but it's not noisy. You barely notice any other sounds other than the conversation you're having and the sound of your knife and fork on the plate. Having a window table overlooking the fountain just ads a really nice touch to the whole experience. The filet mignons were to die for. They had an amazing crust with just the right amount of salt and pepper for seasoning and the meat just melted in your mouth. There was no effort cutting or chewing. We had some drinks too, the Pink Velvet and the Pain Killer. Pretty pricey but soooo good. Some of the best cocktails we've ever had. Amazing flavor and mega strong!  The staff are beyond great. So friendly and professional. They're the best. Chris G was our waiter and by far one of the best I've ever had. Answered every question we had, made great recommendations, had a nice laugh with him, and helped make our experience there that much better. When I called to make the reservation I spoke with Miles and right off the bat he made me excited to go have dinner there. He was able to get me a nice table at a great time and made it seem real personal just booking my reservation. Everything was just phenomenal there. Best restaurant experience my wife and I have ever had.",

In short order the hostess placed us at a table overlooking the Bellagio dancing fountains; the romantic view for which my honeybunny was hoping!  After much discussion with Igor -- our server extraordinaire, who completely made our evening -- we decided upon the Chef's tasting menu. Each course was worthwhile, with exceedingly high marks for the venison: succulent, tender, perfectly-cooked, gently seasoned to bring out the best taste notes. The celeriac puree upon which it was seated was the perfect counterpoint.  Unlike most tasting menus, this one has large portions, and both of us were very sated before the dessert course. We enjoyed both the chocolate taster plate and the banana tower and would do both again :-)  This was a great two-and-a-half hours, Igor took care of us from start to finish, and a return to the Eiffel Tower restaurant is at the top of our list.",

Well there actually was no crepes, only a kids menu crepe. So that was kind of a bummer but then we where still hungry and excited to try something out. Important note- we don't eat pork... this actually narrowed the menu down quite a bit. I am not eating meat at all so really my choices where pasta or waffles and my husband ended up getting a burger when he really wanted something more breakfast like. Everything was good, customer service was pretty good too but the menu was really small and included a lot of pork or dairy and meat mixed. I got the waffles which where good but really rich and I could only eat a few bites before I got a sugar overload. We both left feeling tired from eating sugary or heavy foods.

    "text": "Visited here for dinner with my wife while on vacay in Las Vegas. Food is just ok - not much of a \"Wow\" factor. Don't get me wrong; the food was NOT terrible. I would try another French Restaurant next time we are in Vegas.   Wanted a table by the window so they suggested we reserve for an early time. Time suggested was 4:30pm which is a bit early for us but confirmed anyway. Scenery was nice and service was superb. Just a little disappointed with the food.   We had the Caesar Salad which to me was the best dish. They make their own dressing which was very flavorful since it had garlic, olive oil, anchovies, and other miscellaneous ingredients. We also ordered the rack of lamb and the filet topped with foie gras. Just ok.   If you like the scenery and a nice view of the Bellagio fountains and just ok French cuisine then give this place a try.",

    "text": "I'm not one to really downplay a really amazing meal but I want to explain  why I felt my experience was just okay.  I'll give the good and the bad to provide a fair review and why I would not return unfortunately.  My group and I dressed up quite nice for this place and headed over on time,  as in we were 10 minutes early just in case.  They suggested this as well.   I called ahead like I had read others do to make a request to get a window seat and the service I got on the phone had been fine. The woman made it sound like it would be easily accommodated and I believed her considering I called a whole week ahead.  She told me when I arrived speak to the front to confirm and so I did. I was greeted with a very monotone blank reply of \"unfortunately that is usually kept for 2 people so if you'd like to sit we'll call you when you're ready\". A little peek into the future all I saw were groups of four... But the reply I got was what I did not approve. No considerate explanation she just brushed it off and said sit down in a rude tone. And no eye contact? That's always a sure sign you're getting great service....  The window seat wasn't the biggest deal but we got a far seat with an overly excited group of women banging their table, laughing excessively loud and using flash photography throughout their meal. Or how about the table in front of us that was glued to their phones and since I was on an elevated platform all I saw in front of me was women editing selfies and checking how many people viewed their snapchat. The reviews who say it was classy make me think they had a better experience than I.  This place is more what you'd call \"Vegas classy\" because had I been in SF these types of parties would have been asked to calm down and remove their devices from the tables.   I give it 3 stars for the entire experience. For goodness sakes, they called me the wrong name when bringing us to the table. Not even an attempt to ask how to say my name, just a really butchered wrong name.  And most of you know the ability to say one's name makes the entire experience more personal. Then we were lead to our table that was placed for 3 instead of four so they made us go back to the lounge once again and wait another 10 minutes. That's not a fine dining experience to me unfortunately.  You've had my reservation for weeks and we get there early make us wait in a tightly packed waiting area and then get it wrong? Maybe in a casual restaurant that'd be fine, but if you tout about being the best you damn well better live up to it. A butchered name and an additional wait because they screwed up? Not living up to the expectation.   For those above reasons I gave it a 3 because it was genuinely just a-ok.   Now the food and service we got was good. Rebecca our server was wonderful and knew her information, which I highly respected as some of my friends didn't know certain parts of their meals.   The filet mignon and the rack of lamb were great, although I will say this. One of my party's steaks was a very easily rare when he had asked for medium rare. I truly believe you can tell how great a place is by the ability to cook the steaks perfectly and he had an extremely rare steak. Not a medium rare, a bloody-raw-middle rare looking steak. That wasn't okay.   We ordered a souffle which was wonderful and came out on time since we had ordered ahead. It had risen nicely and the texture was soft while the flavor was light with a nice touch of the Nutella flavor.  That was probably the nicest part of the meal.   It wasn't the worst experience and I'm no fine dining expertise, but I have certainly had my fair share of classy restaurants in LA, SF, NYC, and DC and this just didn't seem to be on par. Part of it is some of the clientele you get. They bloody tell you business casual with jacket preferred after 4 but I see a man in a opened plaid button down with jeans on?   You have a mixture of fine diners and people who look like they're going to clubs. And then you get people who are overly obnoxious at their tables without respect for others because it's Las Vegas and not some real nice restaurant in some upscale neighborhood of a metropolitan city. My friend accidentally bumped into a woman and she was so offended she had to turn around and make a nasty comment? Such a classy experience! Not to exclude the fact that he apologized profusely and was trying to make room for someone else to walk?   A mixture of good and bad service, coupled with decent food and a bad seating placement make me go with a 3 star experience. I didn't leave this establishment thinking \"wow that was the most amazing meal I've had\" I left thinking it was okay. I paid four hundred dollars for a incorrectly cooked steak, a wrong use of my name, obnoxious clients around us and the errors made initially and with that I probably will not return to this establishment and will look elsewhere for a better fine dining restaurant.",

I had the 22 oz Bone Morrow Ribeye and I requested a blue cheese crust which was not on the menu but after our server spoke to the chef they were able to accommodate the request. This was the best steak I've ever had, the bone Morrow was as amazing as everyone says, paired with a nice glass of wine and the amazing views this is an all time favorite of ours.

    "text": "Came here for dinner for my friends bday  Environment: located inside the Paris hotel, the restaurant has a very classy feel with a spectacular view of the Bellagio water fountain. The restaurant is dimly lit, they play jazz music, most people are dressed up as resort wear with collared shirts and long pants for men is required. They also have a person in the restroom that hands you towels when you are done washing your hands.  Service: my waiter was awesome, as well as the wine lady who constantly made sure my glass was filled. I felt a little bad for my waiter as he was squished in the corner table. My biggest distaste in this section was the fact that I had requested seating with a nice view of the fountain, but they still put me in a tight corner although there was some availability closer. Everyone in my section seemed a little bothered probably with the same issue. My waiter really made things better though and even gave us a complimentary birthday dessert which is super appreciated and topped off my friends birthday night.   Dinner and drinks: they have a wide variety of wine selection, mostly above the price of 70 minimum. There cocktail list was a little limited with the basic drinks like old fashion and manhattan, nothing too special.  The food on the other hand was amazing. First, their bread selection was subpar. It made me crave Mon Ami Gabi's fresh baguette right down stairs. But we ordered the escargot, the steak and lamb. The escargot came fried and sauteed. It was drowned in a delicious olive oil sauce that taste amazing with their bread. The ny steak was cooked perfectly which is medium rare for me. The crust was salty and nicely crispy, which a warm tender inside. It wasn't very large, so I left craving for me. It really tasted like butter and melts in your mouth, so good! The lamb with the ratatouille was also super delicious perfectly cooked medium rare. It also tasted buttery, but had that gamey taste. The side dish olive oil mashed potato was also good but nothing remarkable.  Overall, this place is very romantic and good for special occasions. The food and drinks are pretty over priced, but nothing I didn't expect from eating on the strip. You should probably arrive early if you want better seating. But, I really enjoyed the atmosphere, the view (even from the corner) and the amazing food. Hats off to the chefs and waiters!",

As I said the service was great, however the food was not good. The escargot was serviced cold and unattractive. The soup with scallops was very bland--no seasoning. The beef Wellington fell apart and was almost well done instead of medium rare. It was terrible. The chocolate souffle was nice. Overall I do not recommend this place to eat.

A little discretion from the hostess' when it comes to doling out the scarlet jacket would be nice.    Now, back to the wonderful experiences.  First, call ahead and reserve a table at the windows with a fountain view.  It's the best view on the strip and a perfect place for a romantic dinner.  This is a must.  Choosing a entree was difficult.  They have an excellent Chef, and their menu is fantastic, but at the end of it, I had been craving a steak all day, and ordered the filet.  It was the best steak I ever had!  And I eat a lot of red meat.  For desert?  Creme brulee; a perfect way to end the meal.  I'll be back!",

Service was pretentious at times and comical at other time. There are restaurants that I have been to that were expansive, how ever those have warrented the price tag. This place was a joke. The only reason I am giving an extra star is because we both had a good lough. I just remembered it was not a lough it was a lough upside down. I am reading all these great reviews of this glorified haute cuisine wanna be, and I am puzzled. Sooooo many places in Vegas that truly serve fantastic food with great service. This one is not it.",

The lobster appetizer and the scallop appetizer my table had was very delicious.  I had the crusted salmon with a side of green beans and it was very good.  The salmon was cooked perfectly and crusted very well.  The green beans had a lemon foam on top that was a neat touch.  They also bring out complimentary desserts (5 small desserts) that were very good.  Make sure and get a view of the Bellagio fountain, they will go off many times during dinner and it is a fantastic view.",

You cannot ruin fois gras and its nice to see it on the menu.  The lamb chops were as tender and tasty as any I've ever had,  while the Wellington wasn't the best I've had it was so nice to see there.  Souffle for dessert, a view of the Bellagio fountains.

By nature I want to hate places like this... in a hotel, overpriced, etc.. but I can't fault them on anything, really. They have a large varied menu of solid French food. Rabbit? check. Duck? check. Foie Gras? check. Also a huge array of fish. If you're looking for a run of the mill \"nice\" dinner that won't disappoint and would appeal to anyone, this is your place. Awesome view, awesome ambience, and although pricey, the food is solid. Not 'omg this is the best food I've ever tasted', just solid and predictable and good. Sometimes you don't want noveau California cuisine.. you just want something reliable and tasty.  I had the seared foie gras, and I got the ahi tuna I had last time again. Both incredible. Dessert was a pistachio souffle. They get points for originality on that one.. plus the flavor was awesome.   After eating at some of the more edgy places in town recently (Cut, Strip Steak, Shibuya, Little Buddha, etc) and being disappointed.. this place is 2/2 on fabulous experiences.",

    "text": "I was extremely disappointed in the Eiffel Tower Restaurant! This used to be one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas for the first-class experience and food that it offered. Sadly they seem to have lost their way. The service was so bad it actually set a negative tone for the rest of the evening! It seems to me that the restaurant's number one goal is to maximize the cost of the meal, rather than provide a positive experience for the guest. They require each guest to purchase an entree (no sharing, no ordering salads or appetizers only).   After getting the manager's approval to share a 9 oz. steak that cost $69 a la carte, our server's attitude turned cold. The timing of the food was terrible. I had taken about two bites from my appetizer when my steak was placed in front of me. My friend, who ordered two appetizers instead of one entree, received both at once. His scallops were cold. (I see that other reviewers mention undercooked scallops, so this is not an isolated or new issue.) Another friend ordered the \"warm lobster\" dish, and it was also cold! We had informed our server that one guest would be arriving late, and she brought his salmon out and delivered it to an empty seat to sit and get cold. Our side dish never came out, and the server said she didn't know we ordered it. We ordered the souffle at the beginning of the meal since we were told that it took a while to prepare, and waited at least 30 minutes after all of the plates were cleared for it to come out. With all of these issues, it was the server's cold demeanor that made us the most uncomfortable.  It is such a shame that the management is allowing the service to slide here, and are ruining what was once a truly wonderful experience. I hope they take reviews like this into account, and make adjustments to their poor attitudes about service!",

We repeatedly asked about the credit card.  Apparently (according to the bizarre explanation we got) the manager had to go wait in the box office line to get the dinner vouchers.

    "text": "First time in Vegas, and the husband took me here the first night we were there.   We sat near the window with a full view of the fountain display outside the Bellagio. Right when we got there we were pleasantly greeted, our coats were taken and hung up for us and we were shown to the table. The atmosphere was AMAZING. We ordered some wine (our server gave us spot on suggestions) and appetizers (Red Wine Marinated Quail) before the main course. Hubby ordered Slow Roasted Filet of Atlantic Salmon and I had the Muscovy Duck Breast. Can I just say that I absolutely despise salmon, but was so tempted to switch and steal the mister's salmon? What stopped me was that I was IN LOVE with the duck! I woke up the next day dreaming of going back, ahhh so good.   We had Classic Potato Gratin as a side and Creme Brulee as the dessert and my oh my, by this point I was in Frenchfoodecstasyland. Some of the best freaking food I've had in my LIFE, hands down.   Also the portions were perfect and though they take a long time bringing out the food between courses it was perfect for relaxing and conversing while watching the Bellagio fountain display. Veeerrry romantic :)  The staff was also very nice, especially one girl in particular who came over and took our picture with the fountains in the back and even complimented my dress. She was the cutest little pregnant person I've ever seen, ha! *creeper* We bought the picture afterwards, it's a nice keepsake :)  Word to the wise, go a bit earlier though. Our reservation was for 8:15 so we weren't done until close to 10:30p...and by around 10:00 all the obnoxious drunks had started getting annoying; men and women alike, but one loudmouth man in particular kept shouting and hooting across the restaurant. It was incredibly disturbing and put a damper on the end of dinner because in such a quiet place it can be pretty startling. I was actually surprised that they didn't kick them out because of the type of place it is. I wish they had.  Anyway. Can't waaaait to go back!",

    "text": "I had one of the best meals of my life here!  The Eiffel Tower Restaurant is a treat!  AS others have said there is a worry that this restaurant would be all about flash with no substance.  It does have flash but it also has plenty of substance to offer.  While this is not perfect it is very, very good.  The service was impeccable from start to finish with the waiter and sommelier working very hard to get us exactly the meal we were looking for.  The restaurant is designed so the spectacular view is forefront and everything else compliments that.  It is slightly noisy but not overly loud.  This place has a happy energetic hum to it.    Many couples were seated directly facing the view away from the noise so I would still recommend this place for a top notch romantic atmosphere.  We were here from out of town to celebrate an event and made the lucky choice of dining here.  We came in just as the sun was setting and watched the strip transform around us, it was breathtaking.  But this place is about more than just a sensational view.  The restaurant opened with a free amuse bouches one which paired three flavors a salmon mousse, asparagus with a lemon foam and a bit of pastry and a wonderful lobster preparation, we argued over which was the best.  We started with caviar, a blue cheese souffle pudding with salad, the fricasse of escargot, sweetbreads and fennel and finally the foie gras with pears.  The caviar was served beautifully on square platforms with indentations for the caviar, creme fraiche and chives.  It was served with a metal spoon rather than a mother of pearl but that was the only flaw.  The caviar was wonderful tasting and all the various accompaniments flawless (there were both buckwheat and plain blini AND toast points).  The foie gras was seared perfectly and came to the table at just the right temperature.  The accompanying pears in a sauternes sauce did not seem quite right as it needed more sweetness to contrast with the foie gras.  The fricasse was not as remarkable as I hope but it was a nicely balanced dish with a great contrast of textures and flavors, it seemed on the mild side for such an ambitious combination of elements but still very nicely done.  The blue cheese souffle pudding was incredible.  It was a sturdy souffle which did not fall when cut into but such a wonderful, flavor and it worked so well with the dressing on the greens.  Just wonderful, absolutely the high point of our starters.  I had the Beef Wellington which was perfectly tender and seasoned perfectly.  Done just on the rare side of medium, it was heavenly.   Our table generally loved the potato croquettes but I was somewhat underwhelmed by them.  They seemed too simple and by the time I was passed them too cool and limp.  Finally the desserts, there were many ordered and consumed at our table.  I remember the Pistachio souffle as being dreamlike in its perfection of flavor and form, the other souffles were magnificent in their execution as well but the pistachio flavor just was so intriguing and well done.  The Napoleon was lovely and just as delicate as one could wish and there was a wonderful chocolate plate that I was too full to touch but looked perfect.  Despite the magnificence of the meal, I have a few concerns about this place.  It is on the pricey side for what you get.  I almost took off a star for the very few missteps during the meal, however the overall experience was so wonderful and the great times I have had stopping by for a drink and an appetizer on past trips to Las Vegas are also terrific, I have to give this my highest rating.",

A good vantage point of Vegas and if you're in the right spot you get a marvelous view of the Bellagio fountains.  However, unless only 2 people are dining, the vantage point is mediocre for the fountains.  Dinner was delicious.  We only ordered entrees as we had to run to a show.  Beef Wellington:  Takes approximately 30 minutes but was worth it.  Very delicious at medium rare but make sure to ask for the sauce on the side as it can be a bit overwhelming.    Roasted Chicken was delish.  It's a large portion and the veggies were cooked just right.  Salmon and the duck were also very good.  Sides:   Classic Au Gratin was dry.  Creamed corn was not good.  It was like a creamy polenta and I hate polenta.  Blah!! Creamed spinach and mushrooms were a hit for the entire table!!  The downer for this restaurant is the service.  Most of the wait staff looks confused and or rushed.  A large table next to us definitely wanted to have a good time and celebrate however, the waiter was clueless.  Our waitress was not friendly and was very curt and short with us.  A real shame for such a beautiful restaurant with good food.  I have to say that I truly enjoyed the food here however, based upon the experience with the waitstaff, the Eiffel Tower Restaurant will not be at the top of my list for a nice dinner out.  There are too many other options in Vegas that have great food and great service.",

    "text": "My husband and I decided on this restaurant to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary. Eiffel Tower Restaurant was going to kick off a spectacular night of good food, strong drinks, and luck at the poker tables...and it did just that; with style!~  Upon entering the establishment, I was startled by the kitchen being right in front of me as I exited the elevator. This was interesting but it is very crowded and hurried when you exit the elevator so you dont really have time to take it in.   The restaurant itself is much smaller than I imagined but in a good way. It is very romantic... We were seated promptly as we had a reservation. Our waitress was simply a joy and I truly enjoyed her presence throughout the evening.   A server comes around and you get to choose your own bread; that was a nice touch and the server was very very friendly and attentive. I like the server nearly as much as I enjoyed the waitress.   They bring out a complimentary amuse- I believe it was a calliflower soup?- It was served cold but it was absolutely delish! At that moment, I had full confidence that this dinner was going to be amazing! Did not disappoint~  My husband had the lamb for his entree and I had the halibut. I cannot speak about the lamb as I do not eat meat but my husband said it was cooked to perfections; which I guess is difficult to do with lamb.   The halibut was to die  for but what I enjoyed more about that entree was the bulgar wheat. The restaurant called it couscous but I am quite certain it was bulgar wheat made into a splendid tabouli! I attempt to make tabouli all the time and it is quite difficult to make really well so I was very impressed! As a side dish we had the mushroom spaetzel?- To this day we still cannot figure out if we were eating mushrooms made to look like noddles or actual noddles that were mushroom flavored. It was truly bizarre but I loved it for being different (and super tasty)   For dessert we have espresso and the Grand Marnier Souffle~   I dont think I have ever had Souffle before and it stole my heart! I probably would have choosen a different flavor next time as I do not think the Grand Marnier added much to it but it was cooked to perfection!   My husband had a great idea that when the Bellagio water show comes on, the music in the restaurant should be timed to play the same music that is going on at the water show. I must say the water show does not leave as strong of an impression without the music to go along with it.    Pricey dinner at nearly $200 for 2 people but in my opinion it was worth every cent!",

I couldn't possibly cover all the superlatives this Restaurant deserves! We enjoyed a reasonably priced bottle of Wine. I had the Bone Marrow Steak & hubby had the Filet. A wonderful Lobster Salad & potato side dish and great Bread/Rolls selection. Next: The View of the Fountains and piano playing softly in the backround in a dimly lit room all comes together with the attentive service of the staff. Sommelier is spot on with wine suggestions. Next time I'd also like to try one of their specialty cocktails. Anything to stay longer and take in the whole experience! Ask for a table at the window for an exceptional view of the strip and fountains. Lyle was so helpful and our server Michael was terrific ! Some mini appetizers, a palette of asst. sorbets and a chocolate mousse were sent over compliments of ET! Wonderful ! Treat yourself to this experience of a lifetime. You only live once. And I cannot wait until next year. We could not even consider another place that could top ET for a wonderful meal/experience all the way around. A big Thank You to everyone there for our special memories !!! Check out their Facebook Fan Page for more info! Trip Advisor loves them too!",

Amazing ambience, attentive, sweet & knowledgable waitress, decadent amazing food, wines perfectly paired and one of my favorite parts-a window seat overlooking one of my favorite Vegas sights, the beautiful Bellagio fountains. I was spellbound & delighted by the entire experience. Extremely romantic & special. A couple even got engaged in the adjacent corner, it was that kind of perfect venue for it :) Neither of us will ever forget this meal and experience.",

Was very delicious, I took the servers suggestion and got it done medium rare, would have liked it a little less pink, but they know best so I went with it. Fiance got veal medallions which were great. We shared two types of potatoes which were both great. We also got the chocolate souffle which was amazing as well. Servers were attentive and pleasant. We had a table with a prime view of bellagio fountains.",

Gary our Maitre D was wonderful and took such good care of us, checking in on a regular basis to see if we were enjoying our evening. The Souffles! All 3 of them were spectacular!

I first must add that I live in San Francisco and we have many great restaurantsthat I can compare it to. That being said I found the Eiffel tower to be better than Gary Danko, Masa's, postrio etc.  Their foie gras tourchon was amazing with a fig puree. Their take of Surf and turf: an 8oz fillet with an amazing crab crake was the best( the steak with so delicate and tender and flavorful). The potatoe gratin side was delicate, subtle, and bursting with flavor. The wine list is a knock out....from chateau margauxs to california pinots and everything in between...probably 500 different wines.  For dessert we had the souffles.....bannana , caramel, and chocolate...very good.  This restaurant is very expensive but I felt, as did the other 9 dinners, it was worth every penny. I highly recommend!!!",

The service is near unmatched and superb, however the some of the food is not quite worth the price. This is another example of hype in vegas, but I will say that over all it is a wonderful place to go if you have the money to spend. the wine list is probably top five in Vegas so it's really more of a reason to stop by. I must admit that I personally took great pride and got far too much joy out of crumbling bread onto the table while no one was looking, just to see the buss boy attendee come running with his tiny crumb cleaning tool. I seriously did that like three times, (he he he).   CHAD",

    "text": "This is our 4th experience dining at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant, while the view is breath taking the \"wow\" factor wasn't there this time.  Can it be that we're used to seeing the view or it may be the new way they configured the tables.  Now small half round tables butted against the windows and so close to other couples that it doesn't feel as intimate.  My husband and I came (again) to celebrate our anniversary.  My husband ordered a couple of cocktails and I ordered 2 glasses of Pinot Noir.  We shared the kale salad that was a little over powered by a sweet yet tart dressing, tart cherries, walnuts and quinoa croutons that were a little soggy. Was a little disappointed that they didn't split the salad for us but served it along with 2 small plates so we divided it ourselves.  The NY steak and filet mignon was cooked to perfection and was delicious.  We shared the potato Anna - a crispy sliced buttery potato that was a tad too salty and green beans almondine that was very fresh and tasty.  For dessert we ordered the famous chocolate souffle which was delicate and rich along with a cappuccino and an Irish coffee.  Our server, David then brought a small chocolate mousse on a plate with \"happy anniversary\" piped in chocolate around the rim... Very delicious!  We were then presented with and got to choose from an assortment of complementary petit fours.  So stuffed at this point but couldn't resist :) David was the greatest, very friendly and made us feel comfortable, giving us the space to have a romantic dinner while making sure we were attended to.  At the end he chatted with us, thanking us for choosing to revisit.  Overall a very memorable evening.  If you haven't dined here yet, it is a must at least one time!",

Shared the warm shrimp salad appetizer (yummy marinated veggies) and blue cheese souffle appetizer (nice and light) .  Then had lobster thermidor--prepared with spinach and mushrooms in a sauce.  The downside was the grand marnier souffle which was feh.  The chocolate my friend had was a little better but still not what I dreamed it would be.  They also gave me a comp dessert for my bday, some chocolate thing in a glass that was pretty good and came on a plate decorated with chocolate that said Bonne Fete.  It was a nice dinner, but I expected even better. So many places in Vegas, don't know if I would go back.",

    "text": "OK my family ate here Christmas night 2011.  Gorgeous restaurant! Spectacular view!  Wonderful service!  Everything I ate was really good.  My only complaint were the hostesses.  All of them were sour and had the personalities of blank pieces of a paper. Luckily  there is minimal interraction with them.  The Wait Staff was really on top of it.  Awesome!  The Food...excellent.  The bread selection was extensive.  I tried about 4 different types of breads and they were all really good.  I can't think of the french term for the item they bring to start off your meal...whatever it's called, really really good.  It was a a califlower puree.  We all enjoyed it, along with the raw beef appetizer which was very flavorful.  Everyone at my table had a different entree. I can't remember what everyone had right now...I know I had the duck, someone had chicken, someone had beef, someone had fish...everyone loved their food!  A couple of people had mixed drinks...can't remember what they were.  But they liked them.  I along with my parents had red wine. Very pleased.  From the very beginning, our waiter explained to us that they are knonw for their souffle and if we wanted it, we needed to order it right away because it took a long while to make.  So my dad, sister and I went ahead and ordered the souffle. My dad and I had the chocolate souffle...my sister had the banana souffle I think.  We all enjoyed it but it wasn't ALL THAT to us.  Also, the menu said it was $8 but we were actually charged $15 per souffle.  We didn't understand why and were too lazy to inquire.  The view...I think from most/all tables in the restaurant you have a direct view of Bellagio's fountains.  It was lovely being able to watch the water show while enjoying our meal.  This place is the ultimate for a romantic dinner.  I noticed there were tons of 2 seater tables right at the window.  Which is cool, especially for their special sunset dinner they have.    On the flip side of that, I did see a lot of larger groups there, like my family.  I think because it was Christmas night, there were a lot of families like us, having their Christmas dinner there.  Great choice.  We were all very pleased.  This was one of the most enjoyable meal experiences I've had while in Vegas.  I highly recommend it!",

    "text": "Hands down, this was the best restaurant experience I've ever had. When we booked, this was what we were hoping for as my partner and I were off to Las Vegas, just the two of us, to get married and this place kept popping up time and again as being one of the most romantic in town. The reviews were good too so we sent off an email to book and explained that it would be our wedding night. The maitre d' replied back very quickly to confirm our reservation and also to say that he would make sure we got a window table. He also made some really helpful suggestions regarding the menu and the best time to eat for the sunset etc. So from the off, we got lovely service. Just to say as well, don't go into this restaurant on a tight budget as that isn't what it's about and you need to realise that you are paying for a prime view, service and great food. It's, I imagine, for a lot of folks like us a very big treat and to mark some sort of special occasion, so go with it or wait til a time you can fully enjoy! I think ours cost around 300 including a couple of glasses of champagne and cocktails. On the night itself we arrived very excited and still buzzing and from our greeting at the lift entrance to the restaurant, again nothing but friendly. Getting out at the restaurant you are immediately sure that the place is something special. The surrounding windows with their views out onto the lit-up strip - just wow. The food smelt amazing too! We had a couple of drinks at the lovely circular bar just gazing at the view as we had arrived very early. Once seated - in a fabulous corner window seat no less - we just couldn't believe the view over the Bellagio Fountains. As for the food itself, it was outstanding and I'd say best I've ever had. We had a number of little starter taster-type dishes and I also had the Beef Wellington and then the pre-requisite chocolate souffle. He had the fillet mignon and a pineapple and meringue dessert, the proper name of which I can't remember. So nice. Basically, it was an unforgettable experience and just the perfect meal to mark such a special occasion that we had hoped for. Brilliant and if ever in town again, we will most certainly be back! Thanks Lyle, Tom and Eiffel Tower:)",

I was a bit apprehensive - you know when you have a great experience at a restaurant and are afraid it can never be as good the second time?  My sister and I dined here last year and the food, service, and ambience were off the charts good -- and we had just gone up without reservations one night when we realized we were starving and managed to snag a great table.  Well my second visit was just as good.  From the moment we entered we felt welcomed.  Our lead server John Paul was everything you would hope for - efficient, helpful, friendly, there when you need him without hovering.  All the other staff were top notch, too.  Everything we had was delicious and beautifully prepared.  For example, I chose the vegetarian entree because it sounded so yummy.  It was.  Delicate crepes were filled with artichokes and walnuts and sat on a bed of the most delicious tomato coulis.  MMMM.  The view of the Bellagio fountains certainly adds to the overall experience here, but I think Eiffel Tower's food and service stands on its own even without the spectacular scenery out the window.",

    "text": "Absolutely incredible dining experience.  If you're coming here for a romantic dinner at a price point - this is not the place for you. But OH is it worth.  Let me start off by saying the dinner is an engagement of all of your senses. It has a stunning view of the Bellagio fountains and the rest of the strip. Being in the main part of the strip, it's expected. Atmosphere is dim, romantic, and classy.  Our appetizers were the escargot and oestra caviar. OH, MY. GOD.   I've never had either - what a first time experience, and probably all other from here will be subpar. The escargot were small in fried balls with some kind of pea reduction and greens, and something else I couldn't identify. The oestra caviar was absolutely exquisite. Served traditional Russian style with blini and small breads, some sour cream/creme fraiche, chives, and some cheese shavings. It left me wanting more. Again, I\"m not going to talk about price. Because if you think about a certain price at this restaurant, you will not enjoy the experience of being here.  For entrees- the rabbit and rack of lamb. After one bite,we both fully completely understood this was one of the best dining experiences we have ever had. The lamb was perfectly cooked at medium (just over rare) It was PHENOMENAL. The right flavour, you can taste the meat exactly as it's meant to be had. No frills.   The rabbit - again for the first time experiencing this. It was served in some kind of roulade style with sauce reductions over a grain - I don't remember. All I remember was heaven in my mouth. A beautiful cut of meat, that defies the expectation of any non-occuring meat - it doesn't \"taste like chicken\". They make sure all the flavours are succinct, memorable, and everything served with their food complements each other instead of overpowering it. You will neither need salt or pepper. It is not oversalted or undersalted.  I must also add that the service was amazing. They knew how to talk about all of their specials. Knew all of the details about their dishes. They were prompt, organised, and checked in regularly like on schedule. Impeccable. On top of that, someone came to change our silverware and WIPE CRUMBS OFF OF OUR TABLE. I couldn't believe it.   It is definitely an experience to be had on the finer side of things in Vegas. Vegas has many amazing restaurants, but this is a must-do. Especially if you're looking to feel \"the finer things\". A classy, romantic, sophisticated experience that you will forever remember - that is, of course, going to actual Paris, France itself....:P",

    "text": "I was not expecting this.  My girlfriend and I sort of fell into the idea of having a French  meal during this trip to Vegas when we saw a travelzoo deal for another restaurant.  That planted the bug in our taste buds, so we started looking and doing comparisons and in the end, had to decide between here and another French restaurant (I forget which).  I was worried about this one because it looked so cheesy.  French restaurant in the Paris hotel which French people probably hate America for building, at a restaurant in the Eiffel Tower, which French people probably hate America for building.  I just didn't think they would do it right.  This is the middle of the desert for pete's sake.  Stupid me.  Firstly, Vegas has some of the best chefs in America, so naturally the food would be good.  But it wasn't just good - it was spectacular.  Every bite was delicious.  And the restaurant has more to offer than just delicious food.  It has beautiful views of the Bellagio fountains.  I don't understand why anyone comes here any other time but at night.  You get the lights from Bellagio, Aria, Paris and Caesar's, and you get the fountain shows throughout your meal.  Further, our server was French (so I guess I was wrong about the French hating us for bastardizing their city).  He was gracious and helpful and couldn't have provided more perfect service.  Shame on me, but I don't remember what my girlfriend got.  I think she got the sauteed snapper without the bacon (vegetarian), but it might have been the Pacific salmon.  I got the braised short ribs.  I was on a bit of a short ribs kick this year - getting in nearly everywhere we visited, and I think I got it like 3 times in New Orleans in April.  This was, if not the best, then top 2 or 3.  It was to die for.  The sauce was incredible, the vegetables were perfect, and the meat was just right.  We ended our meal by splitting a creme brulee.  Unfortunately, still not as good as my girlfriend's creme brulee and why she doesn't market it to restaurants is beyond me.  That said, as far as non-girlfriend made creme brulee's go, then again, this was the best or at worst, second best.  This is Vegas - if you come to a restaurant like this, be prepared to leave with a second mortgage, a payday loan, and maybe even an organ or two after you sold them to pay the bill.  But, when you choose right in Vegas, its well worth the money.  This was one of those meals.",

This guy seriously ruined the experience: didn't check on us, forgot out appetizer (but didn't charge it), we had to literally wave him down to refill our drinks, which he also forgot and then delivered with an attitude... It was terrible! Granted, we went in looking super casual (we're from LA) but it was just lunch! I've never felt more contempt from a person, I was just genuinely shocked and a little uncomfortable afterwards. This guy seriously ruined it. They should promote the bus boy! He was on top of filling our water, and removing plates when we done etc...   I think if you are lucky enough to get a good server the experience here would be lovely. But the old man that we got seriously ruined the experience.",

Our food sub-standard for the price and the main reason I gave this restaurant only 3 stars.   I had the venison which was dry and tasteless. Only saving grace was the sauce they provided with it. Not worth a tenth of he $65 they charged for it.  The view beautiful, though.   My wife had the duck which was tough and chewy. Again, the sauce made this bearable. Did I mention the view?  Okay souffle dessert was good, so I'll give them that.   Overall, with all the quality restaurants in Vegas, this one not worth the money. View nice, however.",

We were afraid it might be a cheesy touristy experience, but were so happy to be wrong.  We reserved a table via Open Table for our anniversary dinner.  Through the online reservation, we indicated that it was our anniversary and that we'd prefer a table by the window with a view of the Bellagio fountains.  When we arrived, we had to wait 30 minutes for our table.  We enjoyed drinks at the bar while we waited and the bartender was pleasant and fast with drinks.  After we were seated by the window with a view of the fountains, our server greeted us and wished us a happy anniversary.  She was very helpful with the menu as I have special dietary needs (gluten intolerant) and was knowledgeable beyond what was available on their gluten free menu.  They even provided gluten free toast while my husband enjoyed the bread course.  The food was delicious and the service was wonderful.  Servers and  bussers attended to us without being overly attentive, but also did not ever leave us wanting for anything.  Overall, a surprisingly lovely and romantic experience at a touristy restaurant in Las Vegas.",

Considering that it is a much more upscale place, I thought the service would be exceptional compared to what I'm used to at restaurants.   The food and service were fairly disappointing. Understandably, its Memorial weekend and packed. Everyone around us was fairly older than us, but we had a reservation for a particularly special occasion. It felt like we weren't treated the same because of the age difference. It's easy to notice when someone is putting on airs around you and when someone is being genuine.   We had the smoked salmon to start, king tenderloin, and Alaskan cod. The smoked salmon and cod were satisfying. Whereas, the tenderloin looked like an oversized burnt lump of a meatball. It was extremely bland and difficult to chew. It costed nearly $70 and was highly disappointing. The only consistent thing was us getting water refills.",

I was greeted by the hostess who took me up to the restaurant via private elevator then to the table.  Since this was a late lunch, there were plenty of open tables, and I was lucky to be placed next to a window with a great view of  the Bellagio Hotel and the fountains.      The Server's Assistant had greeted me with incredible bread and then took a drink order.  Shortly after that the server, Mark, had introduced himself and went over the menu.  The lunch menu was limited, however, gave great options.  I had opted for the the Parmesan Crusted Chicken which included Au Gratin Potatoes and Mixture of Green Beans and Diced Tomatoes.    I was in no rush for my meal was was able to enjoy the Fountain Show at the Bellagio Hotel.    The Assistant brought the meal within ten minutes, again, I'm on vacation and I'm in no rush.  The chicken was so delicious with the Parmesan crust and the lemon wine sauce.  The green beans were crisp while the diced tomatoes were so sweet.  I wish the potatoes were little crispier, but I'm not going to complain.   Both Mark and the assistant would check in with me without being overbearing.  The decor is definitely more upper scale but relaxing enough for a late lunch. Mark had presented me with dessert options..... so I ordered the Apple Streudel.  Just like the main course, the dessert was just as good!  The restaurant has an open kitchen  - which is spotless!!  For a topnotch dinner, check this restaurant out!",

The first was to celebrate my anniversary, which is how my boyfriend fell in love with their duck fat potatoes (seriously...when we left the city and he reminisced on our trip, it was the first thing he'd bring up!) and the amazing view of the Bellagio fountains from so high up. So I took him again this year! Given that I am dairy free and pescatarian, I didn't have quite the same regard as him after our first trip, but this one left me singing a different tune! Obviously, French cuisine-- as our waiter acknowledged-- is near impossible to find without dairy, but our waiter knew off the top of his head which dishes could possibly be made to fit my diet and consistently checked in to ensure I didn't accidentally eat the little goodies they provide with the meal-- like the amuse-bouche-- and didn't even require me asking for olive oil and balsamic to accompany the bread before providing it. He was incredibly attentive and so helpful every step of the way! The best part was that when the entrees came, mine was AMAZING! I had fish that, despite not having its usual sauce on top, was so flavourful and well worth the price! Considering the view alone is worth the price of the meal, to have such delicious food (as my boyfriend enjoyed his meal again this time), a cocktail, and dessert for less than $200 on the strip and THEN have the romance and ambiance on top of that-- this place is an amazing deal for the experience. It's unparalleled, and the food was impressively tasteful considering the limitations I imposed on the chef with my diet. Overall, every second was a delight, and we'll have even more great memories from this trip to the Eiffel Tower restaurant. We might have to make this a tradition!",

    "text": "This place needs an attitude adjustment at the front of the house.  We had a 4:30 reservation for Valentine's Day. We were told to go about 30 minutes early to get a table with a view. When we walked in the place was half empty, they tried to seat two of us by the kitchen in the way back--no view. I said, \"um no, we came early to get a view\" Then, they tried to put us at a table facing a huge pole, while all the window seats were opened. I said no again, then they got upset and made us wait until they then moved us to the back again with a view of the top of a stadium or something.  I wanted to leave, they made their feelings towards us known, but they gave up and said, \"fine! Where do you want to sit??!!!\" I said, \"we came 30 minutes early to get a table with a view, we want a view.\" That section was empty, like one table had been seated, so there was really no issue. I was a server for 8 years and I know these things. They were beyond rude and it almost ruined our Valentine's Day.  Once we were sat someone came over and plopped roses down but didn't say anything, they were for me from my boyfriend but I had no idea. They were rude as hell in there.  He proposed that night, but luckily not in that place. We went to the top and he did it there.  This all said, the food was amazing and it better be for over $500, it was not worth $500 for two people. Honestly, they also added the tip and then tried to get us to add an additional $90 on top of that, what was that? The fee for treating us like we didn't matter? Like we were nothing? Excuse me, no. We were guests of the hotel and were staying in a suit too.  I doubt I'd ever go back there.  On one hand, it is the night he got down on one knee and proposed, on the other, they went out of their way to make us feel insignificant and horrible.",

    "text": "Two stars for the beautiful view. My 3rd visit to Vegas and this place had been on my bucket list, and it turned out to a complete disappointment.  Made a dinner reservation for our anniversary, as we sat down the waitress greeted us with a wine and cocktail list, I've kinda noticed she was waiting for us to order drinks or bottle before giving the dinner menus, in about 5 minutes sommelier stoped to see if we had questions ( by working in this industry I know pretty much about wines and was taking my time looking at the list) just give us dinner menus already!  The whole time being in this place made me feel so obligated and uncomfortable, I know this is place is stands for the view, in NYC we have plenty of high end restaurants with the view and we know what's that all about but our waitress kept on being pushy and make us order more then of what we want,   We wanted to share the ribeye and she said unfortunately they were out of ribeye and recommended something else and pointing out that we should have one of our own each ( stop trying to up sell and just concentrate on your service and knowledge first ) and we picked a side to it (potato gratin) and she asked if we wanted some mushroom sauce with it because steak doesn't come with any and we said sure, AFTER GETTING THE BILL THERE WAS A CHARGE OF $15 for side of mushroom that we didn't even ordered and if she suggested something she has to let the guests know that there's gonna be an up charge.  Our night was ruined after of being rushed and feeling uncomfortable we did not even want to stay there no more we asked for the rest of our food to go after getting to the hotel and opening boxes we only found the potato gratin and side of mushroom and NO ANY STEAK. Here $200 went down the drain.   Stay away from this place. Or just come for the view and have the cheapest glass of wine here because they don't worth your money. Horrible experience.",

    "text": "Very disappointing experience. When we arrived it was kind of like a cattle call-- we were herded to the reception area in the front of the restaurant by a very curt woman who \"greeted\"\" us upon getting off of the elevator in a very unfriendly manner. We were taken to the front of the restaurant where we told to wait for our table even though we had a reservation.  We  had requested twice in 2 days that we have a window seat. Finally, we were seated and it was in a booth tucked in a corner at the bottom of stairs and metal girders overhead, so we had to duck and scoot around to get in-- probably the only seat in the house WITHOUT a view of the Bellagio fountain (one of the reasons we went was for the view). We asked our waitress if we might move to the wondow seat in front of us that had just opened up and we were given an aswer about some sort of logistical miracle that would have to take place for that to happen...uh, okay!?  Service was slow, after waiting for our main course for a while and noticing others around us eating and becoming very hungry, we asked when our food might arrive...the response was less than polite- \"Why are you in a hurry?\" Um, no sorry just hungry!? The food was mediocre, not as spectacular as expected. Riding back down in the elevator with another couple, they said they were also very disappointed. We all agreed we won't be back...3 stars was being kind.",

In fact my husband said his chateaubriand at 69.00 was dry. My filet mignon was fine.  My sister's cauliflower steak was too spicy. The view is limited from tables unless you are only two people because then you can sit at the window.  The waiter is attentive but you do not get those extras like  free quail eggs or salad or sorbet between courses.  The portions are small. The wine is prohibitively priced.  I recommend just having drinks at the bar where the view is better.",

Perched upon the 12th floor or so the swank restaurant and full bar offer pent house style atmosphere.  Prices are upscale with most lunch entrees ranging from $16 to $36.  We sampled the following items:  Lamb Burger: a thick 1/2 pound crazy juicy mouthful of wonderfulness! Using Moroccan spices red peppers, onions and yellow squash this burger was one to remember.  Potato chips were served on the side $18.  Eiffel Tower Burger a classic well cooked yummy burger also served with potato chips.  The burger was good but not in the same class as the lamb burger $16  Mushroom Pasta: fresh spaghetti noodles with a light sauce and mushrooms. Great flavor and just the right size portion $18  French Cream of Onion Soup; creamy onion soup, I prefer the original version $6  Lunch was also served with a Celery root puree which was a delicious bite and the some of the best baguettes ever!  Since we were there to celebrate my daughters birthday she was presented with a beautiful chocolate mousse along with milk chocolates and jelly candies.  Service was outstanding and although the prices were high it was well a great dining experience.  I highly recommend coming for lunch.  Note: The Bellagio Fountains start at 12 or 1pm on the weekends.",

Walking up to our table we saw it was the corner table for two, definetly the best! we were amazed with the views, the restaurant is very upscale, perfect ambiance, the service was excellent, the food was exceptional. I had the rack of lamb which was the best I ever had! For a special ocassion, I would definetely recommend this restaurant. After our dinner we also enjoyed the live music playing at a lounge in Paris, we had been looking to go dancing, but not where we have to spend $ on a bottle to get a seat at a club.

They bring fresh bread and butter to your table (even at brunch), which is pretty much my favorite thing on earth. They also provide an amuse bouche which was a delicious surprise. Our main dishes were great as well. OH AND THAT VIEW THOUGH. Loved it. During the day was awesome because we could watch the fountain show. I was less than impressed with the cocktails though. My bloody mary was ok, but I had a drink that I believe was called the sparkling rose and it was just fine. But I've definitely had way better 20 dollar cocktails than that.   A side note on the service, the server's assistant (a young guy, didn't catch his name) was awesome and super attentive. The server was not really that memorable but she was adequate. However, I wanted to give the bartender a talking to...He was rude, I asked for a food menu while we waited and he responded \"I don't have one, I'll have to go over and get one, we don't serve food at the bar\", in a super condescending tone. I assumed that meant he would walk over and get one, but he didn't, so I got up to do it myself. That would have been fine, had my cocktail been 8 dollars, but I'm not paying for an extra side of attitude. And he kept calling me \"my dear\", which is only endearing if you're an older lady or gentleman, homeboy was barely 30, so it was just annoying. Any way, the service doesn't affect my review, just venting :)",

Was so tender and moist and the celeriac puree gave it perfect balance.   I would def recommend the chefs tasting menu, and prepare to be full. Usually with tasting menu's I leave hungry but not here. We also loved our server Igor, he really made the night for us. I hope this becomes a tradition and we can return again and again. PS.

Everything was amazing, their service, their presentation, their attention to detail. Our meal started with a cold cauliflower soup to whet our appetite and cleanse our palate. We were offered four different bread choices. Our fabulous appetizer was a smoked salmon with creme fresh, onion, dill, capers on toast. It was a large serving; three of us shared. My sister and I had the pork tenderloins, and my brother-in-law had the chicken breast. Both were exceptionally delicious. The servings were large. We also had some delicious green beans. For dessert we ordered a pistachio souffle that was so very unique and melt in your mouth yummy. We were celebrating a birthday, so they brought  complimentary and delectable chocolate mousse on a plate with Happy Birthday written in chocolate. In addition, we were offered tiny desserts at the end of our meal: salted carmel brownie bite, milk chocolate, pistachio, and marshmallow bite.  Each of them was phenomenal.  No, the meal was not inexpensive, but it was well worth every penny. You certainly get what you pay for.  Our waiter and busboy were wonderful and attentive. We trusted their recommendations, and their suggestions did not disappoint. Kostya P. was a superb server.",

    "text": "This restaurant was recommended to us by a colleague. We came here for dinner during sunset to celebrate Father's Day. Before arriving I received text messages from the restaurant about the dress code and any special requests we had. I asked them to write #1 father on the dessert dish and they confirmed.  The service from start to finish was smooth and professional. The view from our table was incredible. If you're looking to woo a date, bring them here.  We ordered their \"best dish\", which was the lamb chops and it was good. It didn't have that overwhelming lamb taste.  We also ordered the queen filet mignon and the veal medallions. On the side we had asparagus and mashed potatoes (good, but they are an extra cost).   For dessert we had the pistachio souffle. Now this was the dish that was suppose to say #1 dad but unfortunately they forgot. That was slightly disappointing but the dessert was delicious and skillfully made. I would return.",

    "text": "Great atmosphere, awesome view, decent food, pricey.  I took some customers out to Eiffel Tower last week and had a good time.  The decor was beautiful yet subdued (as a French joint should be).   You have to go up an elevator several floors - the result is one of the best views of the Strip.  It's great just to look out through the glass at all the lights and buildings.  If you're seated well, you can even catch the Bellagio water show from your table.  Foodwise, I think it was good, but not awesome.  For a French place, the French bread was meh - you can do better at the grocery store.  My foie gras was excellent though.  I think it scared off a couple of my customers haha.  My rack of lamb entree was pretty tasty, though it was a little hard to cut.    Being a Chicago foodie (hmm that probably sounded pretentious haha), Vegas restaurants don't automatically knock your socks off.  There are lots of great Chicago restaurants to compare (and several of them, like N9ne and Japonais, also opened up shop in Vegas).  Eiffel Tower definitely wasn't 5-star quality.  I would probably be even harder on it if I wasn't on an expense account.  But hey, it's Vegas, so you are expected to pay a lot for everything, right? :)  The view , though, is very unique and adds to a fine dining experience.",

Don't get confused when you get off the elevator. At first you feel like you ended on the wrong floor because the kitchen is literally right in front of you when you get off. I bet the chefs there get a kick out of seeing everyone's confused look each time they off the elevator. Don't get scared and run back into your elevator safe zone. Make a right and the restaurant is right there. No reservation was required during the busy brunch hour and they took us to our seats right away.   The brunch menu wasn't too bad. I got the Chicken panini, but what impressed me more were the freshly made potato chips that came on the side. I couldn't stop eating these. Pringles, you need to hand over your catch phrase to these Eiffel Tower chips because I really couldn't just eat one of these.",

New York Strip Steak w/ Bone Marrow and Cabernet Reduction was excellent (this is what I ordered and would order again) Filet Mignon was okay, not as good as the New York Steak Sea Bass was whatever, definitely not worth $44  Mushroom side was terrible, asparagus was nothing to write home about.  The chocolate cake was amazing (not the souffle, the regular mousse type cake.)  One turn off is that they had forced gratuity of 18% on a party of 5.  Considering we had a $740 bottle of Hundred Acre Cabernet, the tip got pretty high.  Regarding tipping on expensive wine, I did some research on the internet and apparently you ARE supposed to tip on the full amount of the bill including the wine, even if the wine dominates the bills.  I guess I'll be ordering cheaper wine in the future.",

    "text": "Gosh I've been writing some bad reviews lately, so lets go for a change and give a GLEAMING review!  :)  Ahhhhh....The Eiffel Tower Restaurant located at the Paris Hotel in Las Vegas.  TRES MAGNIFIQUE!!!   It was our company's annual corporate meeting and we were treated to a wonderful dinner here.  The elevator doors opened to a bustling kitchen, and might I say CLEAN as a whistle.  White and sparkling.  We were then led off to the dimly lit dining room...very romantic and stylish the VIEW is what makes this place special.  The Bellagio Fountains directly in front of us.  Spectacular!   We started with cocktails....I had a Blueberry Vodka/Soda with a lime twist.  Strong drink just like I like em....very nice.   Upon recommendation from our waiter, I ordered the rack of lamb as my entree.  This was the BEST lamb I have ever had.  Sooooooo tender and cooked to perfection.  It melted in my mouth.  It was served on a bed of a tomato puree with artichokes, which was equally as delicious.  We got several sides to share, my favorite being the Potatoes au Gratin (served in a mini cast iron dish- very cute).  The wine was flowing and I was in taste bud heaven!   After a while more of wine, dining and conversation, our desserts came.  Boss had ordered us 1 each of the different souffles...all were deeeelish but my favorites and the group consensus was on the Pistachio and the Chocolate.  Best souffle I have had!!! The Petit Fours (I think that's what they are called) came around and I got the Chocolate Caramel...again....DELISH!   Capped off the evening with a fantastic champagne toast.....what an evening!!!   It's pricey, so be prepared to drop some dollars here, but the experience is all worth it.  We had 5 star service, food and drink.  My ONLY complaint was the noise level, but it was so crowded how can you help that.   I can't wait to go back here!!!",

    "text": "Went here for dinner on a Sunday night. We got a table facing the Bellagio fountains, and got to see the show every 15 minutes.  Our waiter was this older man who was really friendly! I had the lamb and bf had the skirt steak roulade, and we both loved it. The lamb was so tender and I pretty much inhaled all of it. The skirt steak came with thin potato strings, which were cute to look and and sort of fun to eat, but we were confused as to if we were supposed to eat with out hands or attempt to stab at it with the fork.  Our waiter also helped us pick out a wine, and thankfully he didn't point us towards the $4,000 bottles, we got a nice $60 bordeaux that was really easy to drink. Also we wondered if we'd have to refill our own glasses, but we never had to worry about it, our waiter came around often and refilled before it could even get low.   You also get to chose from three or four different types of bread, as another waiter comes around with a tray of bread. I had the french bread and the wheat, they were both yummy, and you know how I love bread. Our water glasses were also constantly refilled by the same person.  They ask if you'd want a souffle for desert, and have you order it as your dinner arrives, because it takes 40 minutes for it to bake. Well, if we had to wait forty minutes after the meal, we would have, it was so good! It was moist, and smooth, and it was just all around great. It practically melted in our mouths. Then afterward, the waiter came around with a little serving tray of these bite sized treats, and we could pick as many as we want. I got a piece of dark chocolate, and macadamia, and bf had milk chocolate and coffee cookie, they were all yummy.  Would love to go back!  (total bill was a little under $200, and totally worth it)",

And because I had such a great experience the first time I recommended that we go back again for a great dining experience. Like in True Vegas fashion dinner was about 2hrs + long. This is not a bad thing I'm just not used to sitting for so long for dinner, being from NYC.   I love french food, most people don't. I really don't know why. I ordered the filet mignon with Bearnaise sauce that was great, another dish ordered at my table was the vegetarian crepes and the salmon or artic char (can't remember). I have to say that we all enjoyed our meal, and if we were not rushing over to see Le Reve we probably would have sat a bit longer and ordered dessert.  The service here was top notch and the ambiance is great too. Its a bit of an older sophisticated crowd (40+) but that doesn't bother me because that usually means the food is great. The decor here is very art deco Paris posh, with the blush burgundy booths. This restaurant does remind me of the Jules Vernes Restaurant in the real ET(i think that's what its called) but this one has a more comfy yet elegant feel to the more sleek and modern look.   If you enjoy french food, a great view and the Bellagio water show this is the place to go.   I l",

Sure it was good but truth be told, if it was 150 bucks and I had no expectations, I would give it four stars.  It tasted fine and the experience was fine.   For 320 bucks, nobody wants \"Fine\" therefore I give it only two stars. Food. - 3 (Ruth's Chris is way better and half as much) Service - 5 Price - 0  Atmosphere - 3 (loud for such a pricey place) View - 5 ... Sit on the glass facing west if you can, you'll see the bellagio water show",

I had a crepe and my dessert was a warm chocolate souffle which was mentioned to me when our dinner orders were taken because it takes a long time to cook and they would put it in at that time if I wanted one.  So I know it was freshly baked just for me!  Wonderful coffee, wonderful views.  A must for a special night in Vegas!",

Waiter's butt came right by us the whole time bc he hardly had room to move. Food wasn't anything amazing either. I wouldn't mind paying for a great meal but that wasn't the case. Can't beat the view but a little more room between tables would make it a much better experience. Won't be going back to find out though if they ever make this change, too many other options in Vegas.",

    "text": "Went here for an anniversary on my last trip to Vegas, and had a great dinner.  Made reservations for 6:15pm on a Friday night and got seated right away.  We even got a window table with a view of the Bellagio Fountains.    We ordered some cocktails that were from their cookbook, so we decided to try them.  I cant remember what they were called, but they were good.   The avocado cold soup thing that they brought out was great, it was crisp and for lack of a better description, tasted like a super fresh, smooth quacamole.   We split the heirloom tomato salad, which was so light, yet so flavorful. It was so good, we had to try to make it at home when we got back.  It had heirloom tomatoes, avocado, radish and some celery leaves.  The dressing was tomato water with a basil oil.  SO GOOD.   The bread guy that comes around is great.  He does his job well, maybe a little too well.  I was full off the bread before the meal even came.   For dinner, we ordered the Filet Mignon and the Beef Wellington.  The filet was tender and flavorful, and cooked just right.  They tell you in advance that the Wellington cant be cooked to order, because they have to cook it until the puff pastry is done, which is good for those that dont already know that.  We also ordered the creamed spinach and mushrooms and the au gratin potatoes.  The spinach and mushrooms were delicious, and the potatoes were decent. They just didnt \"WOW\" me.    While ordering your meal, the server asks you if you will be ordering a Souffle, because they have to put the order in early since they take time to cook.  We read reviews on Yelp that said you have to try the souffle, so we chose the chocolate one.  It was light and had just the right amount of flavor.  Next time, I think I'd like to try the raspberry one, if it is in season. The waiter was super nice, and he brought out this cute chocolate...thing...on a plate that said happy anniversary in chocolate.    Since it was a nice night out, we bought tickets to go up to the top of the Eiffel Tower, and it was super convenient that we could buy them through the restaurant.  We also bought a copy of their cookbook, so that we could learn to make that addicting tomato salad at home.  Our bill came out to just under $300, for 2 people.  Not too bad considering we paid $35 for the cookbook and $30 for the Eiffel Tower Tickets.   The only reason I am deducting one star, is that the downstairs staff isnt very friendly, and when we had trouble finding the elevator to go up to the restaurant, this elevator control lady was rude, telling us that this was only the DOWN elevator and to stop pressing the button.",

Everything was on point.  Best to go in the evening to get an appreciation for the Vegas strip at night.  We had s reservation, arrived a little early but was seated immediately.  Our waiter was friendly, the food came out quickly and was delicious.  I was impressed with how quickly the desserts were served, apple strudel for me, and again it was excellent.

The tower ride isn't free, but the view is soooo worth it, especially if you get to see the fountain show.  Onto the food / service / restaurant experience.  I normally only talk about the food and the service in my reviews, but coming here was truly an experience.  When you step out of the elevator, you get a full view of the kitchen.  You can see everyone in their matching chef attire.  You can see how clean the kitchen is.  It's really neat!  We were celebrating our anniversary, so we got a great table.  The view was great.  Someone came by to take a souvenir photo.  The food was also good.  Not the best food in Vegas, but the experience certainly made up for it.  This was also a rather expensive meal, a few hundred at least (plus the souvenir photo!), but it was so worth it.  I would definitely recommend this place!",

    "text": "This place is receiving a 3 star rating from me. Maybe I shouldn't have such high expectations for the place. I was here with my friend to celebrate her birthday and made my reservation way in advance to for 5:15pm to guarantee a window seat to view the sunset. Turns out the sunset time for the date was for 7:50pm. So I guess we were expected to sit for approximately 3 hours.   Atmosphere: We had a table towards the back of the restaurant, but it did have a pretty good view of the Bellagio fountain. The temperature of the place was nice and cool because there were only about 10 tables that night. It was not packed at all so the noise level was good.   Food: We were not that hungry when we arrived being an early dinner, so we decided not to do the tasting menu and ordered a le carte. We ordered 2 cocktails (Pink Velvet, The Eiffel Affair), two appetizers (Casco Bay Jumbo Sea Scallop, Red Wine Marinated Quail), two entrees (Black Cod, Altantic Salmon), and the Pistachio Souffle dessert to share. The food was all delicious, but the quail was a bit rough. Even though it was marinated, it lacked flavor in the meat so the sauces made up for that. The black cod was really good at first but it became a bit saltier towards the end as I was finishing it.   Service: This is really where I dropped the star for this place. After being greeted and lead to the table, our waiter, Mario, came by to ask us what type of water and asked if we were interested in wine or cocktails. My friend ask for the beverage menu and he came back with the just the wine list. It was later on when another gentlemen in a grey suit who came by that we request the cocktail list from him. After placing our orders for the appetizers and entrees, we didn't see our waiter much after that. Our waiter made us feel like he just didn't care. Our food was brought out to us wrong. It's only the two of us and he still couldn't get it right who's food it belongs to? He was busy attending to the table next to us with the family of four for the most part. He did not let us know that the souffle took about 20 minutes to prepare until after we ordered it. Whereas the other table, he went over to ask if they would like to put in the order in advance half way towards their entree so they don't have to wait for it. They came in after us and ordered after us, but was given their dessert first. Also, the other table next to us had flowers on the table because their dinner was for an anniversary celebration, but we didn't even get a card anything. Even a simple steak house would have had some kind gestures. I did saw the other waiter brought out a mini dessert with Happy Birthday written on the plate for one of the table (HEY, WHERE IS OURS?!)   I honestly felt that the whole experience with the restuarant was dragged down by the service we received. I did notice that the table of two next to us had a very pleasant waiter who was much more patient and attentive. They have a staff who provides consistently good service to everyone. Overall, the view was very nice and the food was good (not blow you away good), but service was a let-down. To create a great dining experience, all three aspects should be present, even if not all at the greatest, but at least at a fairly good level. I would have thought a place like this would know that. Our check was nearly $250, I definitely expected more from it.",

    "text": "This is for a special occasion only, but if you have one (birthday, anniversary, proposal - we had one while we were dining - she said yes!).  Great spot if you can't make the trek over to Paris and see the real thing.  This is a pretty good way to spend an evening.  Asked for a window table and we got a great one with a view of the Bellagio Fountains and the beautiful floor show every 15 minutes out the window was spectacular.  You should note, that there is a dress code for this place.  Guys have to wear a collared shirt.  I didn't and was handed a white kitchen shirt upon arrival...not my taste.  I did not go in a tank top and shorts either.  I wore a nice pair of slacks, dress shoes and a collarless red v-neck designer shirt that was way nicer than some of the unironed things I saw throughout the evening.  A simple reminder from the hotel would have made that less awkward for an otherwise nice birthday dinner.  A great wine list, but had to ask for it.  Good selection of US and French options.  I chose the French - duh!  But it was really from France, not a mock up.  A most excellent Bordeaux that was perfect with the meal.  The bread is offered per slice and a nice mix of options, but the butter reminded me most of Paris, so that was good on anything they offered.  I chose the Beet Salad for the appetizer.  Also really great.  This looked like it was going to be a four star restaurant on food, but the steak was only so-so.  Cooked good enough, but it was a little bland.  A Morton's or Ruth's Chris steak is sizzling hot when delivered and smothered in butter, but this one, well, cooked decent, but just didn't have the experience of a terrific steak.  I had the red wine sauce as a side, which helped it along.  For dessert, we shared a Caramel Souffle and that was a nice end to the meal.  Very light and airy, and who doesn't like caramel?  The waiter also brought me a mini-Chocolate Mousse which was a bonus.  Plus choice of a small petit-four - I picked the Salted Caramel.  Enjoyed the experience, as it was a fun dinner, but this is a special occasion place.  Save it for that.",

Both dishes underwhelmed and belonged in a diner instead of a fine restaurant.  Sadly, the much anticipated souffle was poorly prepared and missed the mark.  Pass on this restaurant and head next door to Noodles in Bellagios.  Ten times better at a tenth the price.",

The wait staff was very attentive to us and kept bringing us out samples to the table of things the chef had created that night.  After our appetizers, our main meals came and Val added on a couple sides to the menu for us to try.    Sorry I can't remember what we all had to save my life, but all of our main course meals were very yummy and so were the sides!  After our main course, we each ordered a souffle for dessert, Val once again hooked us up and gave us 3 more desserts including the gelato sampler, creme brulee,  and this other thing that I forgot what it was called.  Either way, my best friend, myself and her fiancee were completely stuffed by the time we were done there.  I definately reccomend this place if you're looking for some fancy French food in Vegas!",

    "text": "I've been here twice for dinner, once for lunch, and I'm torn between which is better.   Ambience: Everything about the ambience is great. From the fancy elevator ride up through the to-scale Eiffel Tower to the open kitchen to the beautiful romantic views of The Bellagio and it's famous fountain show, this was unbeatable.   Service: We've always gotten great service here. The waiters are charming and unobtrusive. The food is served at perfect temperatures and the presentation is always beautiful. Thankfully, the beauty of the food matches the delicious tastes as well!   Price: Yes, it's pricey, but oh so worth it! If you're going to splurge one tine for a meal in Vegas, this is the place to do it!  Food: Let's get down to business. The food is awesome. And for a French restaurant, this place is neither \"overly French\" in that uppity manner, and the food is ripe for any palate, although, yes, the portions aren't huge. The foods are very flavorful though, and don't require large portions; in that True French fashion, the food is rich and luxurious in your mouth.  I'd recommend you try something completely new for you, be it the escargot, the foie gras, or even just something fancy that you can't pronounce. And don't forget dessert! Seriously, every single dessert is heavenly!",

Take a deep breath, dress up and relax. Do NOT keep any activities after the dinner here since the dinner will take at least 2 hours (typical of a french restaurant). Here are my 3 most important tips for future patrons.  1. No tickets or shows for at least 2 hours (preferably 3) from your reservation. 2. Reserve a table ahead ALWAYS and ask for a table by the window with a view of the Bellagio Water Fountain. 3. Try the Bananna Souffle, the maitre d will ask if you want it right up front while seating you since that takes time to prepare.",

    "text": "My favorite pastime is going out to dinner. Living in San Francisco, there is no shortage of excellent food. That being said, the reason that this is my first Yelp review, is because Las Vegas, to me, has proven to be such a mixed bag in regards to its' dining. It is extremely difficult to discern in any way other than a dining experience of your own, whether or not a restaurant is good, or merely another shiny tourist trap.   My boyfriend and I dined here about a week and a half ago. Our experience was stellar. Every member of the staff that helped in providing us with one of the most pleasurable dining experiences we've ever had executed with decorum, class, and warm welcome. Our request to have a window seat was graciously accommodated, and the view of the strip and Bellagio fountains was beautiful.   We started with two delicious cocktails. Both very refreshing and inventive. Then we ordered our dinner. We had the crab salad, black pepper raw beef, beef wellington, and the flat iron steak (notice a pattern?), with mushroom spaetzle and creamed spinach. I won't lengthen this review by picking apart each dish. I must just say that every dish was EXCELLENT. The wellington was delicious in its' flaky pastry, the flat iron cooked perfectly. We paired out meal with a lovely Bordeaux. I wanted seconds of everything we ate, but needless to say (that due to the generous portions not usually associated with fine dining) I didn't even have room for dessert.   Our server, Josh, was extremely attentive and had a great sense of humor. We never had to ask or wait for a single thing. At the end of the meal, he brought out a small assortment of petit fours, which was a pleasant surprise, because as full as I was, I have quite the sweet tooth and rarely skip dessert. We just booked our next trip to Vegas, which will be at the end of September...yay! I absolutely can not wait to come back and treat ourselves to another dinner at Eiffel Tower. (Or two)",

    "text": "The views were amazing.  We saw several Bellagio fountain shows.   Don't feel too weird taking pictures, everyone does.    The food wasn't amazing but it was good.  We both had the skirt steak which was extremely well flavored and tender.  There were several extras, which was nice.  We went for our anniversary and the restaurant brought us a nice little dessert on the house.  The staff were all very nice and thorough but I did constantly feel like they were trying to sell me something from the cook book to the constant comments of this nature: \"Did you want to add a side of potatoes to that?\" (When the dish came with a variation of potatoes).  On a final note, if you're trying to decide between the Top of the World and the Eiffel Tower Restaurant stick with the EFT.  Paris is much more centrally located and the buildings you have views of aren't tiny specs in the abyss.  And Paris is just plain classier.  Having to trek to the Stratosphere takes the class out of the experience.  And when you're in $50+ pp you want a little class.",

All the reviewers have already mentioned the spectacular view esp with the Bellagio fountain light show, but keep in mind that they will stop the show if it gets too windy (and it gets windy in vegas all the time).    The food is good.  We had the froe gras which was good (but not as good as I expected) and I had the rack of lamb which was very yummy.  My gf has the filet mignon which was cooked to perfection as well.  Their souffle is good and it has so many flavors to choose from (Chocolate, Grand Marnier, Pistachio, Banana and more).    Their wine list is very extensive and very reasonably priced I thought.  This is one of the few restaurants that server one of my favorite \"cheaper\" cab that I like (Justin's Orphan)",

The food was fantastic!! I tried escargot for the first time...interesting! I ordered the Char broiled Filet Mignon with Lemon Parsley Butter. DE-LISH!! For dessert we ordered 4 souffles: Gran Marnier, Pistachio, Pumpkin and Banana. They were all fantastic!! Mine was the Pistachio and made sure to eat it all!! The service was very attentive and polite. With the room dimly lit made the atmosphere quite cozy and intimate. The only thing I didn't care for was when you got off the elevator at the restaurant you were in the kitchen. I seemed kind of awkward.",

He chatted with us about his world travels, his previous careers, his future fiance and his favorite foods/drinks.  He paired each course with a drink or glass of wine and was spot on with his pairings.  I had the avocado with fresh crab appetizer and it was paired with a riesling.  Excellent.  Then, the walnut and artichoke crepes with a fresh berry house cocktail.  Delicious!  Finally, a Pomegranate Italian-style margarita with some chocolates made on-site.  Fantastic!!!  We could not have asked for a better welcome on our first day in Vegas.  Yes, we ended up spending a small fortune for a total of 8 drinks, 2 appetizers and 2 entrees, but I couldn't be happier as I left and promptly took a nap.  Will definitely be back, probably our first stop for the next trip!  P.S. The Blue Cheese Souffle is out of this world!!!",

    "text": "My husband and I made 5:30 reservations (can we say geriatric) for dinner in the Eiffel Tower so that we would have time to eat and watch the sunset before our 8pm show.  It's a lovely restaurant with a beautiful view of the Bellagio and it's dancing fountains.  We each ordered a steak and sides and a drink and relaxed.    We were chatting so much that we were shocked to realize that it was already 6:30 and we hadn't seen or heard from our waiter in an hour.  Granted, we were busy conversing, but it seemed odd.  We asked another waiter to track down ours and 15 minutes later our waiter approached explaining that he had somehow forgotten to put our order in.  We were disappointed but understood...we asked if we should bother to have them put in the order...could we make it to the show in time?  We were assured that we could so we sat back and relaxed again...until 30 minutes later when our waiter told us that there was a problem in the kitchen and they had JUST started on our order.  We panicked.  A manager came and assured us that the meal was on the house and that we could still have time to eat.  Meanwhile I asked for a refill (which NEVER came) and when our food came we scarfed it down (so sad because it was good) and ran off as fast as we could to our show.  I don't know what happened with us...it certainly cannot be the norm for this restaurant or else they wouldn't still be in business, so I hate to judge them too harshly.  They did take care of us and the waiter admitted his mistake.  It was just a little frustrating...a romantic, relaxed night out turned little stressful.  When I am in Vegas next I would like to try them again.",

    "text": "COLLEGE STUDENT REVIEW -   Las Vegas is an amazing place but can hurt already the poor college student budget. I have been to this place not once but several times! First time, my friend and I was tired of the crowds and the strollers. I was tempted to kick one out of the way. Why bring babies in LV? So we saw the menu for lunch. We didnt have a reservation but got in right away and a great view of the strip by the window. Of course this place is a prime photo spot. Unfortunately our camera batteries was dying. It couldnt handle Vegas either. We had a soup, shared an appetizer, mineral water, and dessert. Just perfect for the budget. I went several other times  - never got an entree. Just recently, another college friend and I had a 6 hours layover on the way to Bay Area. we grabbed a cab, hung on the strip and had dessert with sweet wine by the bar. This was on THANKSGIVING day. Flights are cheap on that afternoon. People was dressed beautifully. So if you come for dinner, dress code! oh, even though we sat by the bar, we could see the Bellagio fountains beautifully. Our cameras was fully charged and we took so many photos.   The bar is a must go! They know their stuff. We were actually on our way to Napa Valley and the sommelier was discussing which wineries in Napa is good to go. Since I am from the Bay I was able to hold a good conversation about recommended places - we both ended up writing for each other. Not only that, he remembered me from the other times I came to Vegas! The service here is amazing. They saw I had a big bag and didnt want to lug it around, they put it away in a safe place for me. But But BUT.... the kicker is........the souffle....is the most amazing ever. I grew up eating French food so take it from me. ITS THE BEST! I especially loved the pistachio one and was tempted to lick it off. Good thing I was in a classy place. Plus I dont want to end up on a viral video somewhere. So this place has class - dress nice - delicious food/dessert/wine, amazing view, more isolated from the crowd yet right smack in the middle of the strip. Hence why it gets my vote of FIVE stars. Don't believe me? I was there just last week.",

I will say there is no real comparison between the two so I will do my best to rate this place solely on my experiences there and not my experiences at the other place.  That being said, here it goes! First, it's expensive and you really don't get what you pay for. It's very noisy inside and I couldn't hear my party of 8 over the buzz of other restaurant goers. The food was mediocre for the price. It felt (and tasted) as if things were reheated in a microwave instead of prepared fresh. The presentation of the food was lacking as well (instead of bringing out a little Happy Birthday dessert for me, they accidentally brought out a Happy Anniversary dessert. Luckily they caught it before I sunk my fork into it, but it kind of grosses me out that they may have given my birthday treat to someone else first). Finally, my party and I felt like the wait staff was rushing us through our meal to get us out the door.  I will say the view of the strip was simply beautiful, though.  Would I go back? For the food and service = No.  For cocktails and the view = Maybe.",

    "text": "For my birthday all I wanted to do was go to the Eiffel Tower Restaurant.  I bought a new dress and was very excited.  My boyfriend and I did a little gambling and day drinking before dinner and his stomach wasn't doing the best.  So we sit down to our table and the waiter was pompous.  He took our drink order, I got champagne and my boyfriend (not feeling the best) got water.  The waiter looked at him in shock and said, \"you know you can order a drink, I didn't ask for I.D.\"  My jaw hit the freaking floor.  I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  First off, he is well above the drinking age and I.D. is irrelevant.  Second, he is a grown man and can order for himself.  Thirdly, what if he were an alcoholic and couldn't drink.  So right off the bat we start off on the wrong foot.  So our drinks come and a bus boy brings me a water that has a bug in it.  I call the waiter over and say, \"I'm sorry, but there is a bug in my drink\".  The waiter takes the glass and doesn't say a word, not a sorry, nothing.  Immediately he comes back with water.  Because of his attitude and the quickness that he brought the water back, I am assuming he didn't pour me a new glass but just flicked the bug out of the water.  I address this with the waiter and tell him that I want the check and I want to leave.  He calls the manager over and I tell her everything that has happened.  She offers to start over, but by that time my night was ruined.  I looked at her and said, if you guys can't get my water right, how can I trust you to get my meal right?!?.  So, now everything is booked for dinner for Memorial Day and we went to Benihanna's because they could take us UPDATE - A manager contacted me shortly after I wrote this review.  He not only made me feel better about the experience but went above and beyond to correct it.  That is customer service I can get behind.  Mistakes happen, and the staff truly represents the restaurant however one bad apple shouldn't spoil the bunch, especially when I see all the nice reviews of this restaurant",

I am so happy that we were too!  We both ordered the duck, which thinking back I wish we had ordered two different meals but it was extremely delicious! I also had a drink, \"An Eiffel Affair\" and it was very good also. After reading the reviews here, I knew ahead of time I wanted to order the chocolate souffle, and we were both SO glad that we did!

I will be making sure that I eat here every time I come to Vegas from now on, it was a great decision!  I just realized I forgot to mention the view!!

The server was nice but honestly our service was very slow.  The food was delicious.  I ordered the ocean salad which was loaded with tastey things.  It had crab, lobster, prawns, artichokes, celery, avocado and best of all a delicious light vinaigrette dressing.  It was large sized which surprised me because most of the time at high end restaurants portions are tiny.  They really didn't skimp on anything.  My bf ordered a lamb hamburger that was delicious.  It was not overly gamey and it came with carmelized onions, peppers, chips, and a delectable sauce.  The bread was also really good.  It had anise seeds in it.  I have to say though I was a bit po'd when I got the bill and realized that my mediocre bloody mary cost $14!  I immediately wished that I had sent it back.  Oh well.  What can you do?  This is a great date place or reception restaurant.  I don't know how often I'd come  ($70 lunches aren't really my thing) but for a special occasion it is perfect!",

    "text": "I went this past weekend and had a good overall experience. You get to the restaurant and take an elevator at the base of the Eiffel Tower to reach the restaurant. The elevator attendant was basically Helena Bonham Carter straight out of Sweeney Todd but I chalk that up to giving the restaurant character instead of being incredibly creepy. The great news is that every table is a good table. The restaurant is surrounded by floor to ceiling windows that give you a view of the strip. I was seated right next to the window so I had a great view of the Bellagio fountain show that popped up every so often.   I don't know if all of the wait staff is French, but if not, they fake it really well and add to the ambience. I get that this can be a really special moment for some people but the little blonde teenage girl walking around with an impressively sized camera is a little unnecessary. It made for an awkward moment but I guess the intentions were kind. The food was great. It wasn't out of this world but  I enjoyed it and that along with the view definitely makes it a place that I would recommend!",

Called early in the morning to make reservation for 8.30pm. And mentioned to them that i would like to have a window table to see the fountains. i was asked if i celebrated any occasion. Thank god i did not because the experience was ruined! we arrived 20 min earlier just to give them some time. when we walked in was very crowded and no place to stand.  At 8.45pm we were approached by the hostess that took us to the very last table in the corner that oversees Paris hotel valet, you cannot even see the strip,  and i requested a window table by the bellagio fountains i told them this numerous time, on the phone and when we arrived, I was totally ignored! They make me so mad by their attitude that i told them i am local i can come back here anytime, i did not come here just to taste their food i came here for full experience. The hostess advised me that we will have to wait for a requested table a little bid more. Few min later she comes back and bring a blazer for my husband saying that you cannot wear  sweater you must wear suit and a collar shirt, REALLY? why did not you mentioned this on the phone about the dress code, and why other guys where dressed differently and they were not given the blazer? and common  its not a five star restaurant!!!! after such a rude approach, we lost appetite, i told them that i would like to leave all of a sudden at 9.15 they found a table for us, one hour after we came there, now what is the point of taking a reservation? I took a deep breath i did  not want to be scandalous never done this before but my patience was at zero.  after we made an order, the waiter was very pleasant, but his assistant was terrible, i asked for bottle of sparkling water, after we had a half full glass of water, he comes back and with out asking pours TAP WATER into our glasses!!!! seriously?????? after we told him we were drinking a bottle of sparkling water, he said no problem i will bring you another one, at the end they charge us for 2 bottle of waters! THE ICING ON THE CAKE WAS AT THE END! When i orders raspberry napoleon, and what did i pulled out from my mouth after taking a bide? yes! HAIR!!!!!!!!! i think enough said.",

We found The Eiffel Tower Restaurant after looking at the crowd gathered at Mon Ami Gabi. Being kinda hungry, we asked the gentleman standing near the Eiffel Tower elevators if the restaurant was open. And there is where our beautiful Sunday brunch begins.   We were seated immediately at a table that overlooked the Vegas strip. We were greeted by our server, Stephen, was extremely knowledgeable about the brunch menu and gave us a few moments to look over the menu while he brought us coffee & a bottle of Perrier.   I ordered the French toast - brioche covered in carmelized bananas, pecans, whipped cream and served with a side of bacon. 'Bacon is good for me' - I don't order French toast very often but this was the best thing since sliced bread. My honey ordered the Eggs Benedict - a smaller portion that we expected, but very tasty with chorizo.   The food was excellent and the view itself makes the dining experience complete. I will definitely come back here again for brunch! It's reasonably priced (compared to their dinner menu), but like I said breakfast is the most important meal of the day ;)  Cheers!",

We waited for our table despite making reservations three weeks in advance and were stunned when a guy wearing a t-shirt and flip-flops joined us in the elevator. But to make him \"respectable\" they gave him a jacket that looked like it came from goodwill and a pair of socks to wear with his flip-flops. He looked worse. The food - I'm sorry but it just wasn't good. My wife had the Beef Wellington and it arrived with the pastry well cooked but the meat raw inside. Obviously the people cooking it had no idea how to make it properly. So I ate my overcooked fish by myself while my wait had to wait 15 minutes for the same Beef Wellington to arrive back at the table in a real mess.  It's just not that good and certainly not worth the prices. If you want good food and good service go to Le Cirque.",

Mom had a great Singapore Sling (she hasn't ordered one of these in like 20 years), and  I had some ginger drink that was on their drink list - both tasty.  We just did dinner - she had salmon and I had filet - both were great (the filet was one of the best I had my whole time in Vegas and we ate at a lot of fancy places!).  If you are a dessert person, you really need to order the souffle - omg so tasty!  I had pistachio and mom had chocolate and both were amazing.

    "text": "My husband made this a Valentine's Day surprise for me.  Made 7:00 reservations and arrived at 6:40 to make sure we were punctual on what is always a busy restaurant night.  He read that this was one of the top romantic places in Vegas.  Imagine his surprise when we  arrive at a what can be best described as a madhouse.  People being herded in a line that took 20 minutes to get through.   After the crazy line, were asked to give our cell so they could text us when our table is ready. Very personal touch... Went to the bar to get a drink and wait and were TOTALLY IGNORED by three bartenders running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Romantic ambiance?  The elevator opened to, I am not kidding, the bustling, freaking kitchen!? How is that for  romantic?  As we entered the line, we passed an entirely too loud band playing what sounded like music appropriate only for a gin joint in the forties.  I kept expecting to see the lounge singer start stripping.  A romantic song was played once or twice, and I assume the loudness was to drown out the noise of the hundreds of people here.  We were acually seated at 7:30.  The most pleasant experince was the food, which was very good, but our \"waiter\" barely had four interactions with us.  When you pay almost 500 dollars for a meal, you expect great food served in an impeccable manner.   This place failed miserably to deliver the service aspect.  I felt SO bad for my husband,  because he kept apologizing for the choice to come here.  It's always the thought that counts and I was blown away only by his romantic gesture.  Only his wonderful company made the evening special. This place was almost a total waste of his money and for that I recommend that others not do the same.  For a better romantic and intimate experience,  I suggest Picasso ( where we went last year).  Really great food and truly top-notch service. Only the food makes this a two star review.",

    "text": "Wish I could have given this place 3.5 stars as I don't feel the 4 stars is completely accurate.  I'm going to start with the best part about the place: the service.  5/5 stars. My friends and I made dinner reservations for a Friday night.  As recommended by other Yelpers, I called the restaurant directly to request a view of the Bellagio so we could watch the water show.  We ended up running later than expected and I called to move our 8:30 reservation to 9:30.  They were very accommodating and let us know that our table will be ready when they get there and to take care our time.  As promised, we did get an amazing view of the Bellagio.  Our waitress was very friendly and attentive.  She offered excellent appetizer and entree suggestions.  We never had to flag her down once to refill waters or put in drink orders.  Also, we were pleasantly surprised that she had no qualms with splitting the check between the 6 of us including 1/6 of the souffles.  From my experience, nice restaurants will not do that for you.  The food: - The complimentary bread included 3 different kinds but were served cold.  We would have preferred them warm. - Blue cheese souffle pudding: The flavors were well-balanced and the blue cheese was not overpowering.  Even my friend who hates blue cheese enjoyed this dish. - Heirloom tomato salad: It was refreshing and flavorful especially with the accompanying citrus basil water. - 2 of my friends ordered the duck and said it was the best they've ever had in their life.   - Me and another friend ordered the baked herb crepe.  For $27, we were both expecting better.  There was a strong flavor in there that didn't match the rest of the dish.  Perhaps parsley?  The food trailers in Austin and La Creperie make a better crepe. - Side of asparagus and potato gratin  - Chocolate souffle and pistachio souffle.  You have to order them at the beginning of the meal as it takes at least 30 minutes to prepare.  They were both amazing.  The ambiance, view, service, and non-snooty atmosphere were my favorite things about the restaurant.  It's definitely a great romantic dinner spot.",

I ordered the filet mignon butterfly cut and it was definitely one of the best steaks I have ever had! For the sides we ordered the mushrooms which was a very different taste for me but at the end everything just went so well together. And the view is just so perfect and romantic, like I said I can't wait to go back! Oh and for dessert we had a chocolate souffle, so yummy!!",

The meal was one of the best we've ever had!   Service: I called to book a special seat for a special occasion and Lyle was the consummate professional in taking care of us over the phone. He made sure to even request the manager, Sharon, to come say hi. (He also suggested rose petals on the table- so note this is possible for a special occasion but I thought it was a bit too extra when I booked).   Sharon not only chatted with us but made us feel so welcome even though it was a busy weekend! Our table had stunning views (could stare outside for hours) and our waiter, Roman, constantly checked in on us.   Food: We ordered the most delicious salmon and cod dishes. One of my guests wanted to try a sweet wine and our waiter brought over something delicious for her palette. The presentation was delightful and the meal ended with the yummiest desserts: crunchy pistachio with ice cream.   Overall:  We will definitely return here again on our next trip! I recommend this place not only for its incredible views but also it's hospitality. There are so many amazing places in Vegas but this place stands out to us the most.",

The food is a la carte, so you need to order every individual element. (Veggies etc). The portions are actually large considering any French place I've heard of. And, yes, the food itself is the absolute gourmet experience you damn well expect in this price range. The service was beyond exceptional. For us it was almost a once in a lifetime experience due to the cost and we're glad we did it.",

If you have a 4:30 reservation, chances are there will be a line at the elevator, so you can't miss it.  We made the reservation about two months in advance and you have to fill out a secondary reservation form and put a credit card number down in case you do not show up they charge you.  My husband and I went here for a special meal, we made a 4:30 reservation for two, because you are guaranteed at seat along the windows to look over the strip and the Bellagio fountains, and boy did we!  We got a table in a nice little corner so it was a little quieter with great views!  Overall, this place is upscale, professional, and wonderful experience!  Our waitress arrived and made the whole experience wonderful with her professionalism.  Instead of bread baskets at the table, a gentleman comes around with a box of fresh breads that you can choose from.  For entrees I ordered with vegetable and quinoa wellington, my husband ordered the dover sole, and we got sides of potatoes au gratin, and brussels sprouts with roasted chestnuts.  Everything was absolutely divine.    The dessert specials that night were souffles that were baked to order and took about 30 minutes in the oven.  We ordered the grand marnier souffle as soon as our entrees came for dessert.  It arrived about 7 minutes after we finished eating (great timing), and it was one of the best desserts we had ever had.  Overall, it is an expensive restaurant and the wine is overpriced, but the entire experience and the wonderful food you get is absolutely worth this for a special occasion.  We will return again in the future.",

Excellent bar service and tasty espresso martinis.  We had a table for two on the window. Our server Igor was attentive and friendly. His assistant server Guillermo was also very friendly and quick with water refills and bread service! We shared a caesar salad, and I had the new york foie gras with a glass of sauterne! Both were exquisite! I had the seafood tower for dinner and my boyfriend enjoyed the new york strip i think. Both were super tasty!   The atmosphere is beautiful and the views of las vegas blvd and the bellagio fountain show are amazing, but what really impressed me was the overall service from the wait staff (igor & guillermo especially)!",

    "text": "This is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas and through the years its been consistently good.   Vegas is a tough place to find good food. Chefs and TV personalities  lease their names to restaurant management companies but of course don't work there which is reflected in the below average food. Also, restaurants that are successful (though not necessarily good) from cities such as New York, Los Angeles and Miami have opened up in Vegas  with increasingly regularity.   Paris is one of the exceptions in Vegas. Its a chef driven restaurant that offers quality ingredients and a kitchen and management team of professionals. This is a restaurant not touting questionable talents of food TV hosts but delivering on good old fashioned culinary prowess.  We have been there for lunch and dinner and just went for brunch and it was quite good. Our service was great but a big blunder was made by our waiter but we let it slide because even good waiters can have a bad day. Plus he was a nice guy.  We had several dishes and while we liked the crepe, the chicken was a little disappointing as it was both dry and overcooked. Oh well, those things happen and everything we had compensated for a few mistakes.  A parmesan crusted chicken dish was great, soup was nice and a seafood salad was good. The burger was also good - not the best but good.  Save room for dessert because they are consistently excellent and are a nice way to end a good meal.  If in Las Vegas and you are looking for a good restaurant in a nice setting, with professional service and even a view then this is a great choice.",

Everything about this restaurant is exceptional: service, food, decor, view, ambience....perfection!  I ordered the roasted chicken; so moist, flavorful, fulfilling in every way possible.  THAT is how a chicken is cooked, lovely!  My mother got the filet mignon; it was exceptional!  The drinks are also fantastic!  The \"Autumn in Paris\" martini is a must!  I usually don't like Martini's at all, but the flavorful depth of it was too good.   Dessert is an experience in itself.  Definitely try the Pistachio Souffle! Fluffy, light, it would just melt so delicately in your mouth.  One of the best souffle I've tasted.    Our waiter was knowledgeable and friendly.  Gave great recommendations of pairings and other suggestions.  This is a MUST when you come to Vegas, you will not regret it!  It is pricey, but hey, you're in VEGAS, indulge a little bit!  Ask for seating near the window with the view of the Bellagio....at night they have a splendid water works show with lights....incredible experience!  This place is definitely as good as it gets! :)",

I was expecting this to be somewhat of a tacky overpriced touristy spot but it was completely not the case! To start our waitress was French which added to the experience. They also had a sommelier to help us with our wine choice.  As appetizers we had a salad and the sweet potato soup. For main dishes we had the John Dory, Loup de Mar, and Chicken. They were all delicious, well seasoned and balanced dishes. The view from the restaurant is amazing which doesn't hurt. I highly recommend and will be back!!",

My entree was the beef wellington, which was my first time experiencing this type of dish. The steak was terrific and the pastry that surrounds it tastes very similar to a vietnamese / french pastry that I enjoy, called Pate chaud. Please be warned that it will take up to 45 minutes to bake so order early! The others in my party had the Filet Mignon, Roasted Semi-boneless chicken, and the Muscovy Duck Breast. We all shared a bit of each others meals and they were all great! For desert, we split the Pistachio Souffle which was very delicious! We had a great view of the strip on vegas and saw a bit of the water show at Bellagio from our seats. Very Romantic.",

The waiter is professional, helpful and folded our napkins even when we went to use the restroom.   OMG - the food here is also great! We decided to be daring and order dessert first! Yum! We shared the chocolate plate, which had like 5 different truffles on it and it was amazing. I brought 5 girls here for my bachelorette party!   I got the Queen filet mignon. It was delicous. I also got it with classic potato gratin, which was a la carte, and very traditional French.   The bread is to die for!!! And the butter too!   I also go the berry drink, and loved it!",

    "text": "This is a long overdue review and I think this review would be the only review that I actually think I owed to Eiffel Tower Restaurant to write.  My experience with the Eiffel Tower Restaurant began long before I even stepped foot in Vegas. I was going to Vegas with my then girlfriend for a weekend in late October 2011 and I'd decided to dine at this restaurant while I was there.    So in  late September of 2011, based on a lot of comments that I had read on Eiffel Tower Restaurant's page on facebook, I chose to send an e-mail to make the reservation to  the (I'm assuming) operating/general manager of the restaurant, Lyle Tolhurst, letting him know when I was going to be dining there and the preferred time of arrival (between 7 or 7:30 pm) and the seat location (by the window overlooking the Bellagio Fountains so we could watch the dancing water). I also informed him that this would be my first time in Vegas and I'm trying to have a memorable experience.  Soon after, Lyle responded to my request suggesting that if I should move my reservation a little bit earlier to 6:30 pm. In his own words, \"We are blessed with beautiful coral sky sunsets that fade into twilight and full darkness. If that appeals to you I would suggest a 6:30 reservation if you are not bowed in by other commitments.\"  I, of course, accepted his suggestion and made a 6:30 pm reservation for a Saturday night.  Fast forward to the day of the reservation, me and the ex arrived promptly at the restaurant and we were seated by the window with an amazing view of the Vegas strip and the Bellagio. To our surprise, our table had rose petals on it. Not the fake kind but REAL rose petals! Our waiter came to introduce himself and made small conversation and asked us if we wanted anything to drink (other than water). After we placed our drink orders and we were looking over the menu, our waiter came back with a small appetizer sampler plate with I think three appetizers on it. Before I was able to say, \"I didn't order this\", our waiter explained that the appetizers were given to us compliment of Lyle.  The steak that I had was great, I can't remember what my ex had but she loved it! The ambiance was nice, and the view was absolutely amazing. Lyle wasn't lying about the sunset. It was awe-some! Me and my ex had an amazing time while I was there. The only thing that I probably should have done is allow the camerawoman (there's one that offers to take your pictures with the Strip/Bellagio in the background) to take our picture.   Also, you have to try the souffle. TO DIE FOR!!!  If you're going to Vegas and you've never dined here. I absolutely recommend it. To get over the top treatment like I did, i would recommend e-mailing Lyle directly instead of making a reservation through a website like open table (which I normally use). I'm not posting his e-mail here but if you go to the restaurant's page on facebook, you'll find it pretty easily.  I really couldn't ask for a better experience while I was here. I would rate this place higher than a five, but since five is highest then I guess five it is!",

My meal was perfect, my date didn't see anything on the menu she wanted. No problem, they offered her three suggestions- all things she wanted.  Dinner was perfect, the staff as well. To top it off we had the Eiffel tower chocolate sampler. BEST CHOCOLATE EVER.   They said they would get the young lady the best seat in the house and they did, although I'm not sure there are any bad seats.   The staff really was very attentive, the meal was perfect, must of all my daughter was ecstatic. Ty!",

When we were sat at our table it took about 10 mins to be greeted by anyone (keep in mind I'm a server). Once our server showed up he did not introduced himself and asked us if we were ready for drinks. So I went ahead and asked him his name and without any apology he immediately turned around and walked away. Skipping him taking the order, food was great. Then he proceeded to ask us if we were ready for dessert and since we were all full we declined. He then had the audacity to make a comment under his breath. I asked him what he said and then he said never mind. I will never come back here ever again.",

The view: The view was spectacular- unfortunately, the servers were constantly interrupting the wonderful fountain shows to ask us to take pictures, or to move our plates.  The food: Good.  Forgettable.  The corn and bay scallop soup was decent.  The corn was off, but perhaps being from the midwest I just have a higher standard for corn- especially at $20 a bowl.  The escargot was bland, but not bad.  My wife's beef wellington was spot on, nearly as good as Ramsey Steak.  My rabbit was also bland, and the presentation made it hard to eat- I did eat it all, but I won't remember it next week.  The banana souffle was amazing, best part of the meal.  The service: Perhaps it was because we were one of the last tables of the night, but the servers were TOO attentive.  Always grabbing things off the table, moving our bread plates, trying to take pictures.  I am all for good customer service, but even for a high-end, high-service restaurant this was borderline intrusive.  Sometimes, less is more.",

We all had the filet mignon which was good, not great, but the appetizers were the ones that were super delicious. I love fois gras and their appetizer with jam was astounding. Super delicious. Somewhat built up by the waiters who said this was the best they've ever had (tough bill to live up to!) but it was super good nonetheless. I don't think waiters should necessarily say that, because anything other than best ever is disappointing. I'd love to try the other items by coming back. I also expected, for some reason, for this to be at the top of the eiffel tower but it's only a few floors up. Good view of the Bellagio fountain though!",

Right when the doors open you see the kitchen and get to smell all the wonderful aromas. This date for me was a surprise fancy date, I was told to look very fancy. I wore a very fancy dress and he wore a suit. We blended it quite well with everyone.  My boyfriend planned all of this ahead of time, which I would suggest to do, because to reserve a window table (which we did) it was $100. The view was beautiful. The fountains went off every 30min. Before our appetizer they gave us a sample of the soup of the day, it was celery something... It was so yummy! We ordered the escargot (I was expecting garlic and butter, but the escargot has more of a cream flavor, different but still good).  In between our app and our meal at 5pm (when the fountains were going off) my boyfriend became my fiance. Yes, he proposed! There was a waitress taking photos of the big moment! She captured all of the wonderful surprised reactions I had and all the love we share. I am so happy he found someone to get a photo of that moment.   My sister called ahead for a bottle of champagne for our big moment, which they poured and kept cold for us.  Our meal came after, I ordered the duck (medium rare) and he ordered the stake (rare). Both cooked to perfection and delicious!  We also ordered the  creme brulee OMG SO GOOD! If I could eat that once a week I would!  The restaurant is beautiful, the staff is quiet and polite and the view is something I'll never forget.",

    "text": "ok, I honestly cannot believe the ratings on this place.    Bottom-line, it is cute that it is the replica Eiffel Tower, but aside from that, this restaurant offers little.  There are simply far too many better spots in Vegas to waste time here.   Pro-  Service was solid and well attentioned. Not full French formal service, but definitely solid. View- nice view of Bellagio fountains and some of the strip, but honestly there are better spots for views (top of tower, Stratosphere, as a couple of others) Desserts- of all the food we had, the desserts seemed to have the most attention paid to them (versus simply mass pushed out commercial kitchen food).  Cons- Food- Food was average at best. Our group had a mixture of apps, salad, steak, fish, and desserts. Nothing stood out as particularly good. Each dish was just lackluster, and given the pricing, you should expect more.  We ate at Per Se the day before and this place does not remotely touch it and yet it was comparable (if not more) in price.  Wine- Honestly the wine list here is shameful.  They have bottles at 2x what you can buy at restaurants within 100 yards (again same bottle at Per Se was $75 less--crazy). I do not mind paying for good wine, but the markup here honestly put a damper on the evening. Just know going in you are being taken advantage of and deal with it. Just for reference, one example- 2 days before I had a bottle of Blackbird, arise and paid $80.  Here they had a HALF-bottle for $90.   Overall atmosphere- The volume of people run through this space shows. The white tile floors are dirty and the red carpet is worn. Again think hectic brassiere versus fine French dining.  Overall-this place seems to be lost between trying to be a high end French restaurant, a brassiere, and a tourist trap, and it owns none of its multiple identities.   Maybe I went in with wrong expectations, but for the $$$$, you should expect more than a decent view.",

Aside from just loving the company I was in while there, I also loved the ambiance, the view, the service (Roman was our server), and the cuisine. The design and decor of the restaurant is very underwhelming; accordingly, I deducted one star. However, the cuisine, service, and view of the Bellagio fountains more than make up for the lackluster decor.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I just so happened to be in Vegas at the one year, eight month mark in our relationship. We were originally planning to get dinner at some Cheesecake Factory-esque restaurant, but when we were walking around Paris, we decided to go with Eiffel Tower Restaurant to make it a memorable night.  We were in town because she had a singing competition at Planet Hollywood. It ran longer than we thought, and in the process I had to push back our 9:35 reservation at the last minute. The staff was very accommodating and understanding, and I really appreciated that. When we arrived ten minutes late, I showed up in a t-shirt and shorts, which, in my defense, was comfortable attire for attending a competition! But of course, not acceptable for a nice, fancy dinner. Definitely my bad! So we speed-walked back to Bally's so I could change into my collared shirt and dress pants. Ended up arriving at around 10:10. Big props goes to the staff of Eiffel Tower for dealing with my follies in such a patient, professional manner!  Now for dinner, we had a beautiful view of the Strip and Bellagio's beautiful fountain show in front of us. That alone was pretty memorable. We were treated very well by the staff, who offered us bread on a nice platter, giving us the option to choose which type of bread we wanted. Before our food was served, we were offered a nice sampling of asparagus soup, which was creamy and delicious.   For our entrees, she ordered the vegetarian option, the Baked Herbed Crepes while I ordered the Beef Wellington which came with a nice wine sauce on the side. Overall the food was good, and having never had a filet mignon baked into a pastry, it was pretty interesting -- in a good way! The wine sauce gave the dish a distinctive sweet, defined taste. My girlfriend's crepes were pretty good too, from what she let me sample... haha.  Our dessert was the Yelp-recommended pistachio souffle, which was nice and delicate. We were also given a choice of chocolates from a platter to round out the night. A nice shout-out goes to Reed, our amazing and efficient server for contributing to an wonderful and memorable dinner experience. Will definitely be back again, and will be recommending this place to family and friends. Thanks, Eiffel Tower Restaurant, for giving my girlfriend and I a great memory!",

She wouldn't give us a slice of a baguette until after we finished our meal...who wants bread after they are finished eating? Seemed like we had to beg after asking for the manager.   One of the \"helpers\" I guess you can say, Alfonso Cruz, had to be one of the absolute best. We looked forward to him actually coming to the table and asking if everything was ok even though he did not have to because he was not our waiter. Willingly, he would check on us and keep on asking if we wanted more bread (: so simple! I really would just come for his service (no lie).   Food was not bad. It was surprisingly good. No complaints.   Thank you Alfonso for the wonderful service! Made our night! He needs a promotion.",

Every step of the service was flawless from the hostesses at the casino level who were very friendly and prompt, to the seating hostesses, the sommelier, etc.  Our captain was Alix Briand and she is a star. What a pleasure to have a dining experience executed by her.  I had the salmon appetizer and beet and goat cheese salad, and veggie sides as I don't eat meat.  Guests had halibut, steak, and leg of lamb and all were completely blown away.  Wine, dessert, sorbet and cookies at the end were a special touch. Save up your calories for this spot as it's worth it and a must eat on your Vegas vacation.",

The views were good and the atmosphere was nice.  The food was good but not 5 star or what I was hoping for based on the high prices but that doesn't surprise me when you are paying for the experience and the view.  We come from the San Francisco Bay area where we are used to many excellent restaurants so my standard are probably a little high.  We had a bottle of French wine that was good, scallops cooked perfectly but didn't wow us.  A Caeser salad that was good.  Salmon entre was good but it could have been cooked a little less.  Filet mignon was cooked perfectly and was good but again for the $80 price I was hoping to be amazed by it.  Sides of creamed spinach very tasty as well at the grotten potatoes.  Again it was all good and we enjoyed this for a one time experience but would not do it again.  Mon Abi Gabi below also with a terrific view of the Bellagio water show serves similar quality food for more reasonable prices.  I think this place is perfect to have a drink and an appetizer and enjoy the view but not for  a whole meal unless money is no object.",

Amazing is an understatement. I got a salad, but everyone's food was pretty delicious. The service was good. They had 3 waiters for our table so we had excellent service. The reason why I gave the restaurant a 3 star was because, they kept  bringing us mineral water, which we did not order and charged us for it. We spent almost $50 dollars for water we did not even order. If you are eating here, expect to spend some money!!! And, the wait time to get the food is also very long.",

Received a window seat, however, it was on the South Side (vs more desirable street side facing Bellagio.)  View was nice, but, more reserved.  Recommend requesting street side with your reservation.  Wife ordered Surf and Turf which was a tender steak and stuffed crab ravioli.  Steak was good (a bit salty), the crab ravioli better.  Loved the sauce.    I ordered the Rack of Lamb which was delicious.  Waiter commented this was New Zealand imported lamb vs the more common US lamb, so it was less gamey.  I notice the flavor difference prior to his informing me, so he was right on there.  I only miss the  minty sauce some restaurants typically include with lamb.    Accompaniment, ordered the cream spinach and mushroom. This was delicious particularly with the sourdough bread that was brought fresh periodically throughout the meal.   Our only complaint was that we were not able to use our Players card  dinning credits there, as they indicated they are not an official LV Paris Hotel restaurant.  Seemed strange as they are in the Eiffel Tower within the Hotel.",

Great place for an occasion or romance.  In order to make a reservation, you need to give them a credit card.  Interesting.  The view is beautiful.  You can go see the strip at sundown and the Bellagio fountains.  The tables that we were seated near the window is very tiny.  Barely have any room. I liked how they had a bread tray to choose from 4 different types of bread.  I recommend the rustic; more Frenchy.  Service was good, not excellent like what I expected from a high-end restaurant.  Wild Escargot on Sweet Garlic Souffle:  I wouldn't have known  they were snails.  Didn't look like it didn't taste like it.  For an appetizer, it was extremely tiny, smaller than my palm.   Lamb chops: Umm...that price for 3 bones of lamb? That is seriously outrageous although it was mighty delicious and it melts in your mouth. Beef Wellington: This isn't what I expected either after watching all these cooking shows.  It was technically a meat pie with a huge cube of filet in the middle. It was good and filling but not really expecting it.   Potato Gratin: Extremely creamy.  I knew it was going to be rich but this took it to the next level. Wild Mushrooms: If you're going to get a side, get this. Armaretto Souffle: You must allow 45 minutes to order any Souffle and it is well worth it.  It was a light delicious cloud of armaretto. Banana Tower Thingy: Love the white chocolate crisp with a crap ton of bananas. It was super impressive but I would got for a souffle instead.  After each meal, they give you as much petit fours your heart desire.",

On the reservation, I noted it was her birthday and we ended up with a window seat right in front of the Bellagio fountains. That is absolutely the best view of the fountains I have ever seen. I think almost every staff member came by and wished her a happy birthday.   The meal options at this place are limited, but I do recommend the steak over the chicken. My wife was eating my steak instead of the chicken she ordered because it tasted that much better. One thing that I was a little confused about at first was before we even ordered our main course, they were asking if we wanted a souffle for dessert. I guess it is because it takes so long to prepare and is made from scratch/to order. I do recommend the souffle for dessert, it tasted delicious!  As a side note, I recommend buying the tickets for the viewing deck for after your meal. The restaurant offers a slight discount since your are dining there. Overall, will definitely be returning to this restaurant in the future (but only for special occasions, $$$$).",

Dessert (white chocolate banana elysee)... perfect. Overall service ... perfect. Thank you Eiffel Tower Restaurant for a memorable experience.",

The views are incredible, the wait staff is impeccable, and the food is top notch. I can't really remember what we both had for dinner, though, because the dessert really over-shadows it in both of our minds. The restaurant has a selection of souffles of the day, and the bff, being a nut about nuts, HAD to order the pistachio souffle. (We had a little debate over which flavor to order, as I looooove chocolate, but I was nice and let him win on his bday.) We both died and went to heaven. It was everything you'd ever want in a dessert--decadent, flavorful, wonderfully warm and rich. We both still talk about that souffle more than a year later, and we even tried to recreate it, which didn't come anywhere close to as spectacular. Yes, the prices are steep, even for Las Vegas, but the food, the ambiance, and the wait staff are all worth it. Even if you don't go for dinner, you should grab a glass of bubbly and a fantastic souffle for dessert while enjoying the Bellagio fountains.",

    "text": "We came to celebrate my father's birthday and I seriously do not understand how anyone could give this place more than a couple of stars if they've EVER had good food in their life.  The place is gimmicky, extremely loud, and for a restaurant that boasts sophistication/romance/fanciness as their schtick, they sure do seem like an expensive version of TGI Friday's. At over 120 dollars per person, I've had much much better quality food and better experience at much less expensive restaurants.  The quality of the beef (we ordered filet) was laughable. Both people who ordered the filet had to send it back because it was not cooked properly (both were ordered medium, and one came out well done, the other one rare).  Someone else got food poisoning from the salmon dish.  The only good dish were the lamb chops (cooked properly and had good taste).  Usually restaurants that have family style sides will give you a reasonable portion. Not here.  Each side dish will feed 2 people,  maybe.  The steaks and fish are served without any garnish.  We ordered a celebration cake for my father, and the cake was atrocious. Nobody even ate it.  We were taking a photo with my dad and some waiter came and crouched next to him to get in the photo. Really?? At a \"5 star\" restaurant?? All in all it was a waste of money and calories.  With so many actually good options in Vegas, please do not eat here.  It took 3 hours to leave the restaurant! The service was painfully slow, meals were cooked improperly and we got one case of food poisoning.  One of the worst meal experiences of my life.  The view of the strip is not worth that kind of pain.",

Also, service throughout was very attentively pleasant for our party of 6.  With regards to the food we'd DISSAPPOINTINGLY say 3 of 5 stars.  Much of the main courses were underseasoned, the sauces were fair (suprisingly), 3 of our meat dishes were overdone, the fish was a bit too dry, & appetizers (except for the savory foie gras)were fair & not quite the 4 or 5 star experience we expected.  For those foodies willing to spend $$$$ for French cuisine in LV we'd recommend: Joel Robuchon @ MGM, Twist @ the Mandalay, or Guy Savory @ Ceasars for a 4/5 star dining feast!!",

We only had lunch there but we were treated just as nicely as if we'd spent a lot more on dinner! From the very start when we were warmly greeted and escorted up the private elevator, to the beautiful table we were given right by the window, and the extremely attentive and friendly service, we really felt like valued customers. We really appreciate that when eating out in Vegas. The food was good but we felt it was almost secondary to the top notch service, presentation, and ambience of the place. Our server was very helpful with describing the specials and other menu items. He seemed to know a lot about the restaurant which came across in a very fun way, his pride was definitely showing! He even shared the recipe book with us, left it on the table for us to look at, but then did not try to \"upsell\" it to us, which we appreciated but were almost disappointed since it was a very cool book. We went back for it later, as we decided we needed to take it home as a souvenir. But that just gave us an opportunity to go back up there at night and check out the view then! And we were treated so nicely when we went back too. Thanks for giving us such a nice memory of this Vegas trip!",

Food was not bad, but the lunch service was impeccable. I was most impress with the professionalism of the lunch staff. We had checked in with the maitre'd and shortly after, a couple with a service dog checked-in. There was a short wait, but I thought it was very courteous of the maitre'd to inform us that she was going to seat the couple with the service dog before us because of the special accommodation she had to provide. As a waiting customer, the notification was delightful. We were sat by the window and were provided an exceptional service by Jason. After experiencing this, my husband and I decided to book for dinner. Unfortunately, I cannot praise the evening staff the same. The maitre'd was rude along with the girls that surrounded her. The food and service was just mediocre. The view was impressive, but I will not fight a crowd to have dinner at this restaurant again. I recommend and will only return to have lunch at this restaurant.",

Now I completely understand they are busy and they cannot possibly guarantee all the requests that come in, but I am sure there is a more tactful way to say it. However, once we got there she absolutely remembered my date from the phone and we got the best table on the window overlooking the fountains. The food was beyond the best of our honeymoon. I asked if they could cook my duck medium instead of medium rare and the waiter said he would have to check with the chef. This always makes me laugh because I think, wait I am paying you, but they said they would accommodate me, and of course it came out medium rare as they said they would serve it on the menu. However, this was a learning experience for me because the duck was seriously the best duck I have ever eaten and I now order my duck as they suggest it because of this restaurant. The view, food, and service was all well worth the experience. I would love to go back again.",

The atmosphere is elegant, yet lively, with art-deco inspired fixtures and furnishings complementing a spectacular view of the strip.  The staff is warm and attentive, without being intrusive.  And, the menu...an absolute delight.  You can choose from Chef Joho's exquisite seven course signature tasting menu or extensive a la carte selection.  I highly recommend the warm lobster salad with garlic braised artichokes.  A superb blend of flavors and textures.  The roast rack of lamb is also quite wonderful.  Cooked to perfection with a crisp herb crust drizzled with a tarragon jus.  Make sure you save room for dessert.  The souffles are not to be missed....I recommend either the pistachio or grand marnier.....and the raspberry napoleon is splendid.  Also, don't be surprised if you're visited by the Eiffel Tower's Manager, Laurent Ertle, during your dining experience.  He works to make sure that every guest is treated with exceptional care.  I've now been to the restaurant about a half-dozen times and each experience has been marvelous and memorable.  One final note, prices are what you would expect from a fine restaurant, but they are realistic, not inflated, and the value is outstanding.",

When we got there, were were taken to the elevator and once we were taken up and into the restaurant, the first thing you see is the kitchen and the cooks. Uhh...not so romantic?? I was a little annoyed that we did not sit next to the windows like we asked, of course I didn't want to make a big fuss over it. The only view we saw was the blue Paris balloon sign and a little of Bellagio. Again, not impressive. My cousin and I ordered a chicken dish, and the BF's ordered fillet mignon. We also ordered mash potatoes on the side since the dishes did not come with anything but the meat itself. Once our dishes came out, like typical French food, the portions looked like they were meant to be eaten for birds. The fillet mignon was soooo tiny and mind you this dish cost $68 and each side dishes was $8. My chicken was \"organic and grown on a special farm\" so this explains why it was $38??? The only thing I enjoyed was their desserts. They were absolutely delicious! We had the White Chocolate Banana Elyse and the Raspberry Napoleon, Vanilla Blanc Manger. They had a beautiful presentation, so pretty to eat. Altogether as a group we spent $400 something including drinks and tip. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind paying a lot of money for a great dinner, but this was not a great dinner! Sorry, I will never return!",

And wow, what an experience. I felt like I was in a romantic show/movie. The waiter seated us ladies first and then the guys. Even pulled out the seats for us (and my bf doesn't even do that for me!) The bathroom has attendants, whom I forgot to tip because I didn't know that was standard etiquette. And the food portions were tiny but amazingly they were filling. I forgot what I ordered because I came here about a year ago, but I remember it having spinach and some hard rice cracker type thing on top. I thought it tasted way too salty but my bf seemed to love it. Overall, it was an interesting experience. I wouldn't mind coming here again for special occasions.",

They open for lunch at 11:30, and even if there were about 10 other people that had been waiting, my cousin and I were seated first.  The meal usually starts with a vegetable mousse in a tiny cup that you eat with a tiny spoon.  I've had tomato and spinach in the past and while they were delicious, this time we had mushroom.  And it was splendid.  My favorite meal is pretty standard here: Crab-stuffed avacado, pan-seared trout with butter and wild rice, and the summer berry pudding dessert.  To drink: Ginger Peach Tea.  My cousin ordered a fois gras appetizer with fig and a salmon entree with the fish hammered flat, seasoned, and fried.  We both had a bowl of the cream of celery soup.  The food is DELICIOUS!  A huge bonus is the tiny cheese and poppy seed popovers that they give you with every meal.  The service is attentive, at times a bit much, but  way better than being ignored.  Our check came out to about $200.  Eiffel Tower is always a must visit when I'm in town.",

First off you take an elevator up to the restaurant and you head towards the kitchen.  Then to the dining room that over looks the strip (it's not as high as you would think).  We get a table over looing the strip (nice).    Our server comes and asks if we would like to order a bottle of wine, and I said yes of course.  A sommelier comes by and asks what are my preferences.  I don't like reds, nor do I like dry whites.  I said I like the sweeter and fruitier variety.  She comes back with this Sauvignon Blanc I forget what but it had lychee in it.  Oh my God!  The best wine I have ever had and I'm a fool for forgetting the name.    We get our choice of breads and we ordered our food.  I got the Lamb Chop with escarole and potato puree.  MMMMM the sauce that came with it...I would have drunk it till I drowned.  we also ordered Scalloped Potatoes, Mushrooms, and Asparagus with Lemon Jus to share.  All great sides with my meal.  My friend ordered the Steak Au Puoive and was delicious the peppercorn sauce was not as over powering as I would have thought.  Friend number 2 ordered the Chillean Sea Bass with Roasted Vegetables- probably my least favorite but it was still good.  Friend number 3 Pan Seared Chicken with Meyer Lemon Jus and Hari Cot Verts- really good chicken was moist, nothing spectacular though.  Friends number 4 Roasted Wild Salmon with balsamic reduction and roasted figs- interesting dish, lots of flavor, but I have to say I would have enjoyed it a lot more if it was prepared with a different type of fish.  Dessert?  My friend got a shot glass with a Cappaccino Mousse along with chocolate caligraphy saying Happy 25th Birthday!  Forever tormenting his demise of turning 25 in his quarter life crisis.  That alone made this dinner worth it.   Total= 475.46 plus we tipped the sommelier nicely on what was simply the best wine I ever had.",

Probably the most expensive meal I've had in my life though.  Dinner for 2 ran me anywhere from $200 - $250 depending if alcohol was involved or not.  Was it worth it?  I think so.  This is one of those restaurants where they offer just more than good gourmet French food.  Ordered their rack of lamb all 3 times, and even though I felt that it was on the salty side, it may have been that salt that brought the flavor out.  The meat was cooked to perfection.  Their scalloped potatoes al gratin and their creamed spinach were excellent, but all a-la-cart so that's how the final bill became so pricey.  Their service was impressive to say the least and I felt we had our own personal waiter.  Very attentive.  The ambiance is very upper crust and romantic, but I didn't feel uncomfortable one bit.  The best thing about this place is the view.  Spectacular views of the Vegas strip and we literally had a front row seat of the famous Bellagio water park so we has some pretty nice entertainment to go along with dinner.  Felt like I was on top of the world!  This is a must go to restaurant if you're trying to impress a date and want to have one of those unforgettable evenings that should of course stay in Vegas.  :)",

    "text": "The Eiffel Tower Restaurant sits on the 11th floor of the Paris' Eiffel Tower replica in Las Vegas; it provides a decor, atmosphere and dining experience that is fitting with its name (which you may either enjoy or find cheesy depending on your likes/dislikes).  A private glass elevator takes guests up to the restaurant (kind of an interesting view of floors and activity on the way up and the way back down).  The elevators opens up to the kitchen where the chefs plate the food.  The restaurant utilizes an old-fashioned dining room--plush red seating and white tablecloth--but the stodginess of it is cut dramatically by the view and utilization of the Eiffel Tower's metal legs within the restaurant.  The tables are strategically placed so that many tables have a great view of The Strip (with the primary attraction being the Bellagio Fountains).  Lots of big floor-to-ceiling windows create the great view.  The metal framework cuts into the restaurant and it gives it kind of an art deco feel.  The art deco feel with the old-fashioned decor really make this place feel like a restaurant from another era.  They started us off with a cream soup amuse bouche that was okay but not great.  The complimentary bread was also okay but not memorable.  We had some appetizers.  The lobster Pain Perdu was kind of like a lobster bread souffle.  It was okay though not great.  We also had some sea scallops that were served in a wine sauce with onions.  The scallops dish was also just okay.  The scallops were tender and seasoned right.  I've had much better though in terms of scallops (both in outside sear and moistness) as well as the accompanying sauces and sides.  We also had a little bit of their cold seafood platter, which included lobster, shrimp, crab, oysters, and clams.  This is not my favorite type of starter (I would rather have hot seafood where the chefs get a little more creative in how they garnish/sauce/cook the seafood).  Everything was okay, but nothing really stood out here.  I had the venison chop as my entree.  The venison chop had a nice red color, but it was not that juicy.  The meat was tender enough and had a decent though not spectacular flavor.  The huckleberry reduction sounded good, but it did not really do much here (not a particularly prominent flavor on the plate).  The main side to the venison chop was an oatmeal cake.  This is the second time I've had oatmeal with dinner (the other time was Bistro LQ).  This would not be my favorite side--not bad (definitely tastes like oatmeal).  The plate also featured black trumpet mushrooms and these were pretty good.  They had a nice crunch to them.  I also tried one of the a la carte slides--classic potato gratin.  It was kind of lukewarm.  The potatoes were tender but a little bland (and lacked a creamy cheesy flavor).  While almost all of the food was average, the dessert was a real winner.  I had the chocolate souffle and it was probably one of the best chocolate souffles I've had.  It had a great chocolate flavor (they served it with a chocolate ganache, which was also good).  What separated the chocolate souffle was the texture.  Very nicely baked.  Great texture and great lift.  Chocolate souffles are hard to get right.  They are typically dry, spongy or liquidy.  This one though was pretty close to perfect.  I also had some vanilla ice cream, which was creamy but pretty standard stuff.  Service was good in terms of getting the food out at a good pace even though the restaurant was incredibly busy (which also caused the restaurant to be quite warm and loud).  I felt though that the waiter was not as good as some of the other waiters I've had recently.  He did a good enough job, but I felt he was a little stuffy.  I think he could have been a little more personable and relaxed.  Las Vegas restaurants are typically overpriced and Eiffel Tower Restaurant is a pretty good example of that.  The food here would be in the same price range as some of the most expensive and best restaurants in L.A.  Even when comparing Eiffel Tower Restaurant to other pricey Vegas restaurants, Eiffel Tower Restaurant still feels very overpriced.  The prices here are similar to Mesa Grill, but the flavors at Mesa Grill are much better (Mesa Grill uses better ingredients too).  Eiffel Tower Restaurant makes a great souffle and I would come back for that.  The food, however, is overpriced and average (despite having the backing of prominent chef Jean Joho, who also operates the Michelin starred Everest in Chicago).  Even though I am not a big fan of Las Vegas restaurants, I think you could do much better on The Strip than Eiffel Tower Restaurant.  I walked here, but I imagine they have complimentary valet parking or self-parking like the other big Vegas casinos.",

    "text": "Ou la la, tres magnifique! The view alone will swoon you.  The service is near perfect.  The food was elegant and tres delicieux!  You will walk away thoroughly satisfied.  The only complaint I could even mention is towards a patron who asked if this place served French cuisine.  Get out of here! :-P    To get to the restaurant, you must walk through the casino floor and find the Eiffel Tower elevator.  A staff member will escort you and voila.  The service was magnifique from the start to the end.  As soon as you are seated you will be asked about beverage.  They will kindly recommend you some wine followed by a buffet of freshly made breads.  Yes, buffet! We went through a few rounds of them.  You get your classic baguet and couple of other delicieux homemade breads!  As the Yelper I am, I had to take several pictures around the restaurant.  You could be seated anywhere and still have a spectacular view of the beautiful Vegas strip and surrounding.  Be sure to get a nice shot with the Paris Ballon in the background.  THE FOOD  Started off with a couple things actually.  First was this complimentary shot of something that reminded you of a bacon potato soup.  Tres bon! Second, was appetizer--a deliciously warm sweet glazed foie gras!   For the main course, I savored every single bite of my nicely medium grilled NY-cut steak with glistening bone marrow accompanied with a side of pillowy soft mashed potatoes.  *food coma mode*  Lastly, the Chocolate Souffle! They served it by pouring warm, melting chocolate into the souffle.  It was very moist and soft with a balanced sweetness from the chocolate.  One thing I really appreciated was them filling your glass of water each time it was low.  You might not be in the real Paris, but the experience here definitely made you feel like you were in the City of Lights.  Merci beaucoup Eiffel Tower Restaurant for a magical and elegant evening.",

Valentino really made us feel comfortable and spoke as though he had known us his entire life, which was quite refreshing. His knowledge and professionalism really made the entire experience worth it. The entire staff was very attentive and friendly. Our drinks were constantly topped off and we never had to wait for anything.  We all had steak, which were by far the best steak I have had in a long time and the best, by far, in Las Vegas.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a high class, elegant meal and experience. Our reservations were on July 28 at 730pm, perfect to enjoy the sunset behind the Bellagio and enjoy the fountains after dark.",

You enter the elevator from the casino floor up to through the iron girders to be welcomed into the Chef's kitchen. They start you off with the lightest creamiest cauliflower mousse that just tickles your palette. Then fresh bread and the best butter ever made on earth come around. The filet mignon melts in your mouth accompanied by a perfect wine reduction sauce. The potatoes au gratin is delicious and good to share. The timing of the service is right on, not too long and not too rushed. Mention a special occasion and you will get a special dessert. Our fave is the smooth creme brulee that you won't find anywhere else. Then finish off with a delightful mini petit fours... I happen to like the passion fruit one. A wonderful place to celebrate special romantic occasions.",

Exciting food, delectable flavors, and ingredients that you would never think of pairing together having a party in your mouth. Half price over this place.  Echo&Rig(off the strip), but sooooo worth the drive. They have their own butcher shop! The meat is not meat, but butter meat. Unbelievable. I have never had a better steak in my life... MUST TRY FOR PEOPLE VISITING! 3 of us, bf and dad, still less than what we paid here.  I'm a local, so I've been to quite a few places here. This is NOT on my radar for the future.  Service was decent. Except for the bus boy who \"cleared the table crumbs\" by scooping over the table on to my boyfriend's lap. He saw, but didn't apologize.   I'm giving two stars for the view. We both ordered filets that were too chewy to be the quality we were paying for $70 each. The sides were bland, not exciting or creative. The only saving grace was the king crab salad as the appetizer.  We did get 6 mini little \"treats\" at the end of the meal!!! But, after a $300 tab for two of us, that's not the happy ending I would expect.",

    "text": "This review is for the Valentine's dinner experience that me and my gf had.  1. we got to the restaurant on time at 7pm, and the Maitre d' routed us to the bar to wait for our (empty) table so that we could spend money on drinks first. 2 mimosas, with pulp, were $36 due to $14 per mimosa price tag and 18% gratuity already included.  2. At $189.99 per person I thought we'd get seated next to a window, but instead we got packed into the middle of the restaurant.  3. the 5 course meal was extremely limited. Only fish or beef (not even steak) were the main course.  4. the food felt too fancy and there was no substance to it. The first course was three 1/2 inch items on one plate, mushroom, some stuffed cracker, and something else.  The remainder of the 5 course meal was: a small salad, then 2 shrimp and shredded pear(?), and then the small beef steak, not even rib-eye, or New York, and then a piece of cake with one scoop of ice cream.  The total bill was close to $500, for 2 people. Of course 18% gratuity already included.  The best part of the whole evening was the bread, it was really good. The french bread and the multi grain bread. But I wouldn't come here just for the bread.  It was really a let down to come here. Especially for the price, this was really a shit show, and I would not come here again or recommend anyone to come here again.",

    "text": "Many tourists or people who live around the area come here to celebrate a special occasion. This was my case too. My boyfriend took me for my birthday while we stayed in Vegas.   Since a lot of people  love to have dinner here, there's always a wait time. We had a reservation but still were asked to sit by the bar or just linger around for a little bit since our table was not ready. It's worth waiting though.   Service is great. They are really on top of their jobs. Because we were going to order a bottle of wine, they brought us a specialist to tell which which wines would pair well with their dishes. Our pick was a favorite of both of us - Chateau Montelena. I ordered Muscovy Duck Breast. It was cooked to perfection. The chef was very nice and brought us a complimentary small dessert so that they could wish me happy birthday until I would get my souffle.   The restaurant has an amazing view over the Bellagio where they do the water show every 15 minutes. It looks amazing from the top of the tower - more so when you have a seat near the window. So worth going here.",

I had a delicious fruit infused vodka before my first appetizer of cooked snails. Great pair. The main course was delicious and the desert was even better. The only thing that exceeds the food is the service. Our waiter made it an actual experience. The only draw back is the price. A complete dinner for my wife and I ran me about $320. And that's before gratuity!",

    "text": "Of course, there is a beautiful view, including the Bellagio fountain show every 30 minutes. Excellent service, from the elevator girl to the hostess to the waiter to the sommelier. Seriously, everything was so seamless between the staff and so well-executed, it was very impressive. Wine list is extensive, with an emphasis on French wines, of course. The sommelier was incredibly helpful in recommending a bottle that wouldn't break the bank. And the food....loved it all. We had the escargot (be warned, it's not the traditional service - the escargot are served on top of a sunchoke flan), sea bass, veal medallions, scalloped potatoes, and mushrooms. Everything was delicious, but the standout was the veal. Every bite was great. I can't exactly call it a complaint, but I would note that although well-executed, the mushrooms seemed a bit boring compared to everything else. After tip and a bottle of wine, our bill was about $300. Obviously you won't go every day, but I think Eiffel Tower is perfect for a special occasion or a splurge.  Also note that the food mostly leans toward traditional preparations...barring vegans, I think just about anybody could be happy eating here.",

    "text": "Want to have an unforgettable dinner and taste the best food in vegas? This is the place you need to make a reservation in.   Located on the actual Eiffel Tower in the Paris hotel, this restaurant is an icon in the strip. You are taken in an elevator by a hostess and brought to the bar area of the restaurant where you check in for your table.   If you call to make reservations be sure to request the fountain view. At night during the weekends the Bellagio fountains play every 15 minutes and you get to experience this great view from your table as you dine.   The service is impeccable. Once you check in you will wait a few minutes and you can enjoy one of their signature drinks at the bar.   The setting is low lighting and the noise is average. It's very cozy once you're inside. Dress code is implemented and this is a restaurant where you want to go looking your best.   When you are finally  sitting be sure to enjoy the spectacular view that the location offers.   All the waiters are very knowledgable of the menu and based on your cravings will recommend you a great plate.   After placing your order they will come with a big tray of bread and you can chose which you'll like to eat from the variety that they'll bring.   This occasion I had the beef Wellington and wow!!!! Made to perfection. The outside pastry was crunchy and the filet came medium rare inside. The flavors of the food are out of this world and you never want your plate to be emptied.   For dessert we ordered the chocolate souffle. It wasn't the best we've had but it was pretty good. It was our anniversary dinner and they surprised us with a complimentary chocolate mouse that was very good.   Our second time in Vegas and we HAD to make reservations here again. We're looking forward to going back and again having our signature plates in the best restaurant this city has!",

The restaurant, is very well appointed with coourtoues staff welcoming guest. We were direct to corner table - best in the room.  Now the food - we started with sharing an appetizer, Hot glazed crab - it  was so well presented, on the taste it was a bit shy, for me, but I am wholesome flavor dinner.  For entree, we ordered the lamb chops, which comes with point noir infused sauce and my wife ordered the snapper - both of them were just divine. Lamb chops were hands down the best I have had in Las Vegas - well done, with perfect bland of marinade and jus. Outstanding. My wife loved the snapper too -and now the best part. the dessert - we ordered the chocolate plate - it was crazy delicious - a mix n match of best chocolate offering in the restaurant - A must have. All this was enjoyed with great French red.  Now the service, our waiter was excellent, he new his job - very attentive and made the right suggestions. Overall a strong 5 stars for the entire experience - its a awesome date night dinner spot - great service, top-quality food and million dollar views",

    "text": "Terrible service from start to finish. I had requested a window seat for our 6:00 Monday night reservation. The hostess seated me in a booth furthest away from the window even though there were plenty of seats available by the window since it was rather early. I asked her if I could sit closer. She said the waitress was not there yet and it'd be another 5 minutes until she would be so I needed to wait back by the front. Why I couldn't just sit at the table for 5 minutes instead of walking all the way back to the front still boggles by mind. Fine. After about 10 minutes, she sits me one table directly in front of the table she originally seated me at. I waited 10 minutes to get 1 table closer when all the tables in front of the window are open? Wow, thanks. She said those tables were unavailable but throughout the duration I was there, only 1 table got occupied. Lies.  The waitress was very pushy. From asking what cocktail we wanted instead of \"would you like a cocktail\" to asking which souffle we wanted before we ordered our appetizers because she informed us it would take 40 minutes to prepare. Okay, just chill for a second. I didn't see her again until dinner was over and she placed the dessert menus in front of me and my guests without ever inquiring if we wanted to see the dessert menu. She just made assumptions about everything that night. Not once was my water glass filled. Not impressed at all with the hostesses and wait staff. Not worth it.",

We were led to the check in counter inside. We were 15 minutes early despite the traffic that day. We waited to be seated at the bar. We both ordered Nitron beer and watched the cool bar tenders mix drinks.   At exactly 4:45pm, the usher led us to the booth near the bar where our backs would be turned away from the Strip View which we requested upon making the reservation. We understood though that the area was still occupied by guests who were there earlier and haven't finished dining. The lady brought us to an elevated portion of the restaurant that was farthest from the window that they thought had a better view. The area felt like we're outcast so we looked around and checked out the available tables.  We chose the one almost at the center of the restaurant it was a great spot. We had plenty of room around us.  Our waitress was excellent.  She had a great energy in serving and checking on us. We loved all the food except the fish dish. I wished we ordered two steaks instead for the main course. The first time I stood to use the restroom, a waiter escorted me. And when I came back, I got a new table napkin. They changed it like 3 times as many as my trips to the restroom.  It's the 2 bottles of beer and 2 glasses of water!   We took our time eating and enjoying the $480 dinner plus tip. Overall, the service was excellent and for a romantic evening like that, I would say it was worth it.   We took home with the table roses and souvenir photo.",

    "text": "We decided to celebrate the anniversary of our engagement here... Kinda fun as we got engaged here, high up on the outdoor deck:) with my wonderful guy down on one knee.  He wanted to take me to Paris France & this was the much more affordable, next best option. Maybe someday:)))  For dinner tonight, he requested a table overlooking The Bellagio fountains & they were kind enough to arrange that for us.    The hostesses were lovely, although the person who booked our reservation & took our credit card information to hold the reservation had not properly entered it in the computer... So we had No reservation. Thank goodness they were able to resolve that & our wait for a table was not terribly long. Maybe half an hour.  Accidents happen so we did not let that make our night miserable. It was weird that they did not offer to buy us a drink or even give us some sparkling water...   Michael was our waiter & he was EXCELLENT!  He has formerly been a chef on private yachts!  His French accent was charming and his service was absolutely impeccable!!! He made great suggestions & we listened to them!   My main course came out not at all as ordered... Michael, our waiter took one look at it and said. No, we will get you a new filet... I felt bad, but he had a new order re-fired immediatelyonly waited 10 minutes or so for my meal.   Foie gras was divine... Filet was perfection, Truffle sauce was delicious. My husband had the green peppercorn sauce & it was also excellent.  We ordered wild rice as a side dish to share... For me it had too much other stuff and not enough simple wild rice, but that is only my preference & it was very, very tasty.   The wine was really overpriced.  Bottles which cost $31 in the store are priced at $110.  Some bottles had bigger Mark-Ups.  The agrivating part is that there is no wine on the menu in the $40 to $50 price range.  That is crazy as there are some really nice red wines which you as a consumer can purchase for $12 to $15 per bottle, Joel Gott Cabernet, Carol Shelton Zinfandel is fabulous, Rodney Strong Merlot or Cabernet... So even with their 3 plus times mark-up, some of these wines could be offered at $40 per bottle.    Their Wine Sommelier was extremely nice & helpful. But there was not much he could do for us as their staring wine prices were so high.  I left wondering if they had a corkage fee.  Drinking a nice red should be affordable, even at the Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton.  So I was frustrated by their lack of understanding their client's needs, wants or choices which would make a dinner much better.    So here is my summary...   Both the Bread & Butter & the cleanse your palate miniature cup came very late.   3   Foie Gras was 5++++   Warm lobster salad was very delicious, but I would not consider it a salad.  Absolutely spectacular appetizer. Not sure how to grade that.  The word Salad means salad to me.   We saved room for dessert & the Salted Caramel Souffle which Michael suggested was craaaazzzy good.  The pistachio souffle was very nice.  Salted caramel is the better of the two by far IMO.  Both are a legitimate 5. Salted Caramel is a 10 if I am being integrous.   Hostesses 5 Michael our server 5 - ask for him if you want the real deal.  He is a Great Waiter!!!   Wine Sommelier 5 considering he had almost nothing to work with.   Reservations 1   Food as ordered 3 Some was & some was not.   Portion Size was Very Small 3   Wine prices 1  Bartenders were friendly, but busy so we did not get anything until we got to the table 4 View from our table 10 No music in the restaurant, so it is a bit noisy.   Both the Bread & Butter & the cleanse your palate miniature cup  came very late.    The bill was sky high... For that kind of price, I really think that everything should be Perfect!   All in all we had a great time.  I wish I could give it s 5 star, but I can't.  In fact likely it is a 3.5 considering all the ball dropping which went on.",

The attention to service and detail was lost at Eiffel Tower Restaurant.   We were not given our table of choice, and were told that the table was unavailable. However, throughout the course of the evening, we saw that the table was available. While we waited for an alternate table, the hostess had us awkwardly wait in the front to be moved one table up. My family and I were excited to sit near the fountains. Unfortunately, this request was not honored, despite my sister noting this request when making our reservation, and upon check-in.  We also had a negative experience with our waitress. She did not make us feel welcome, and was very forceful about ordering items off of the menu. As soon as we sat down, she was pushing us to order souffle, without even introducing the specials or asking about beverages. I understand that that souffle takes longer to make, but she asked several times. When we told her \"not at this moment\", she stormed off. When we had questions about the menu, she seemed exasperated and was not very helpful. Throughout the evening, she did not come check up on us. From the angle where I was sitting, I saw her talking with her co-workers while ignoring the guests. The only time when she was quick to service was giving us the bill. WOW.   When you're spending $$$$$ at a restaurant, the dining experience should be impeccable, but instead, we were left with more to be desired.",

Dark but far from gloomy.. More like sexy but let's eat first..lol. The couples are lucky because the small tables hug the windows with the spectacular view of the strip. This is definitely the place to be is the second thought that came to mind. The third thought was, let's get to that stuffed lobster that intrigued me in the first place. Katrina G took her usual time deciding on her meal while I tapped my fingers in angst.. Lol. FINALLY she decided on the super tasty chicken dish forgoing steak two nights in a row. Again, her chicken was good, but my stuffed baked lobster tail was unchallenged! Hands down, the best meal I had in Vegas this trip and trust me, we had A LOT of meals.. Lol. The service was what you expect from a high end restaurant with an older gent dressed in a sharp tux attending to our every need.   I've been going to Vegas at least once a year for some time now. Eiffel Tower restaurant will have a standing yearly reservation after that damn lobster tail.. Lol",

    "text": "The Eiffel Tower Restaurant is more flash than substance. The best thing about this place hand down is the view. Everything else is just blah.  *Reservations: They use OpenTable, so it is pretty easy to make reservations. About 2 days  prior to actual dinner, a conformation text is sent, with explicit mention of their dress code.   *Dress Code: Like others have said, what a f***** joke. Yes they did make one gentleman take off his hoodie and barrow a jacket, but other than that it was a crap shoot of what you would find. Yes, many followed it, but it was highly questionable on some  individuals that they let in during dinner service. No way in hell did their attire meet their so called dress code.  *Views- The views were stunning, there is no denying that. Many of the tables lined the windows, and depending upon your seat, you were offered a spectacular view of the Bellagio fountains and Paris Balloon.  *Gluten Free Food- They had a separate gluten free menu with a number of different options. They did also offer a tasty gluten free bread prior to dinner.   *Food - For about the amount of money per item, I'm sorry the quality didn't match up. You could go to a handful of restaurants on the strip and save half of what you spent dining here.  *Service - Attentive and friendly  For me this is really a one and done restaurant. If you promised to take someone to dinner in Paris to dine at the Eiffel Tower but didn't say that you weren't taking them to Paris, France,,,by all means, this is your way to say that you lived up to your promise.",

Of course reservations are recommended.  Greeted by our server and very well informed of the tasting menu as well as the appetizer menu.  Was provided w/ a complimentary pumpkin soup to cleanse the pallette.  For the entree I had the 22 oz ribeye w/ the bone marrow The Mrs had the rack of lamb w/ the olive oil mashed potatoes. All food was exquisite. The steak and lamb were cooked perfectly to request. The olive oil mashed potatoes were the best mashed potatoes I've ever had. Smooth, creamy, and flavorful. For dessert we finished with chocolate cake that I do not remember the name at the moment. Very rich flavor and a masterful piece of art. Petit fors were provided as a complimentary item.  Although the menu is quite pricey; if you're looking for a total elegant experience with top quality menu items; I recommend treating yourself and/or a loved one to a visit to the Eiffel Tower restaurant.  The view of the Bellagio fountain is available which is the just the cherry on top to a fine dining experience.  A wonderful experience!!",

At the end of dinner they gave us dessert and on the plate they wrote Happy Anniversary in chocolate which won me some cool points with the wife. I don't see how anyone could ever rate this place lower than 5 stars. It is pricey, but this is not a place to go if you are pinching pennies. I would highly recommend this place, especially if you are trying to set a romantic mood for something special or if you really want to let someone know that you love them.

    "text": "Went here to celebrate a birthday was sure to do the 4:30 resie to guarantee a window table. We asked if it would be possible to combine the two different tasting options because we are Pescatarians and needed substitutions for the two meat options--one of them being foie gras. Ugh! Can you imagine? Server was a tad hesitant at first, but only because he did not understand what I was asking. Once he understood, he happily agreed to ask chef. Chef, of course was eager to please with the combo tasting. It started with three different amuse bouche options, followed by a delicious scallop, and then some very tasty brussels sprouts. We ordered a Caesar salad A la carte, and they fit that into the next course. I highly recommend their Caesar salad. After that, we have the most incredible fish called char...which is a combination of salmon and trout. Yum! This was my favorite course of the tasting. After that, we had some tasty cauliflower steak and finished it all off with a cheese plate and the passionfruit souffle. We had a variety of drinks as well starting with a glass of champagne and an old-fashioned and then moved on to our favorite drink the rice as a rack, and finished the meal with their special berries-in-the-glass French version of sangria. Sorry I cannot remember the exact name. Because it was a birthday, we were super extra and got the additional photo and a rose from the bathroom.  Be aware there is a bathroom attendant. It is awesome to go somewhere that so easily could be a tourist trap, but ends up delighting you across the board. I look forward to going back and ordering the main course option of that delicious fish.",

The waiter was fairly new, I can tell as he fumbled about the food and specials. But for the most part, I will *maybe* come back here. Had the beef carpaccio with capers (yum!), the grand seafood platter (oysters were really good but they also included some raw clams which were disgusting!) but the lobster and giant shrimps made up for it,  filet mignon (just okay), duck confit (okay) and smoked chicken (which was dry). Although, I must admit that those little puff parmesan little pastries they served as appetizers were delish!...",

Definitely a good idea to make reservations, this place gets packed!  We started off with the cold foie geas and blue cheese souffle, both were decent but not outstanding.  The blue cheese souffle reminded me of bread pudding, it tasted okay but wasnt anything special.  The cold foie gras was a tad salty even with bread, I think the seared foie gras might have tasted better.   The bread selection was good, I liked the french baguette.  Our bread came out cold, so the waiter gladly brought us hot bread on the spot!        My friends ordered entrees of salmon, sea bass, duck breast, and lamb chops.  The seafood dishes were okay, nothing to rave about.  The grilled duck breast was excellent!  The grilled lamb chops were by far the best ive ever had!  It came out tender, juicy, and had no gamey flavor at all!  It had the texture of a filet mignon and taste of a prime rib, which was quite unique...definitely a great entree!        We ordered two souffles, a pistachio and banana nut...both were great!  The souffles came out hot, super light, perfect texture..by far the best souffles ive ever had!  The banana nut tasted excellent!  The pistachio souffle was also unique, both were very tasty!  I'd come back here just for the souffles..and they are so light that you can eat two of them by yourself!     Overall, the service here is excellent, all the waiters are super nice and constantly check up to make sure everything is satisfying.  The food was perfect, but the portions were on the small side.  The souffles are amazing, definitely a must-have!  Prices here a little high, especially for such small portions, but everything was cooked perfect and presented nicely!  This would be a perfect spot to take a date, nice cozy and dimly lit place with a romantic feel, and great views of the strip, including the bellagio water show.",

Our server made sure we understood the menu and was accommodating to all of our needs. He was very professional and nice.   The food is on the pricey side, but its all worth it!!! The souffle is a must.

They didn't have to be, but it just goes to show you how immaculately professional and courteous this place is.  When we finally arrived, we waited no more than 10 minutes to be seated at a window seat with the most luscious view of the Bellagio fountains. The hostess, our server and even the random guy that came around to give us more bread rolls and cheese balls were all kind, polite and never once rushed us throughout our entire 3 hour (!!!) dinner.   If you do decide to come here I highly recommend the tasting menu. While a few of the dishes were quite forgettable, the the view and the service more than made up for it. We had:  - Trio of appetizers/les amuses bouche: The mushroom custard was incredible. - Warm lobster soup: The soup itself was lovely, but it was covered it what I can only guess was a spring roll wrapper. Curious, indeed. - Halibut: Good, but meh. - Roasted rack of lamb with tarragon jus: Highlight of the evening. The lamb was tender with a slightly crispy \"crust.\"  - Camembert wrapped in poached pears: Seriously disgusting. I like cheese, but that combo was hard to stomach. - I had the Grand Marnier souffle and he had the pistachio souffle. Both we exquisite--both exhibited a delicate taste through the slightly eggy custard texture. The server suggested the chocolate souffle which we will definitely try the next time.",

I was hoping the water show across the street would be going on during the day, but no dice.  The staff was very friendly and had no problem getting my lady friend a shaw since she was cold. You take an elevator up too the restaurant, which is really cool. I recommend going in the day time if you want to save some cash. Probably a great place to take your lady to if you want to be romantic. Would not recommend doing this on a first date though as it would probably be a bit much. Minus half a star for SLOW food. I was thinking to myself, \"Is the chef cooking the food in Paris or what?\" :-)",

I also asked if they can put roses on the table. When we arrived, everything was organized and roses were there. Joshua was our waiter. I have never seen anyone provide such high level of service. In Seattle, we ate at Canlis, Rover's, and some other expensive restaurants, but we have never seen anyone come close to Joshua's level of service. This guy was amazing. We took his advice and recommendation and ended up being extremely happy at the end of the night. Food was amazing. Wine was great. Their dessert is so good you may experience orgasm. This restaurant will not disappoint you. It is expensive, but it is worth every single penny. Right there and then, we decided to make it our annual tradition to come to the Eiffel Tower every year on March 8. Thank you Joshua, thank you Eiffel Tower!",

You'd expect the kitchen to be in the back, but here it was the first main attraction. Very clean and \"white\" themed. It was definitely the cleanest looking kitchen I've ever seen! The decor is simple and not overly done as it is made to make you feel like you are in the Eiffel Tower overlooking the view. Nothing fancy on the walls since it is fine dining. The booths are very comfortable and seat a part of 4 just perfect. You get the view of the water fountains of Bellagio every 15-20 mins or so. Although I would have loved to see the setting sun from there. The service was a bit off. Our water seemed like he didn't like out of towners (the again, who does?). He was very short with us and had a sarcastic tone. That's fine, but we were expecting a 4 star restaurant service. The meal itself was so-so. I expected it to be perfect as we were supposed to feel like we were in France, but the choices weren't that creative. Probably the best part of the dinner was the Raspberry Souffle with vanilla sauce. Mmmm. It was a good one time experience. The ambiance screamed out of towners, not really romantic.",

The amuse of cheese puffs (whose fancy french name escapes me right now) was perfect - light with a hint of fennel (i think it was fennel) and great.  Crispy Michigan farmstead Artisanal Camembert with Almond Apricot Petite Salad was our appetizer - would've been better wrapped in puff pastry instead of wonton skin, but it was a great bit of cheese and the accompaniments were sized and paired well.  I had braised short ribs as my main, and my goodness were they rich.  the fat hadn't quite melted down the way you'd want it to, so i found myself eating around it a lot, but the portion was big enough that i felt like i got plenty of meat, despite leaving quite a bit. the chestnut spaetzle was probably fine - i didn't care for the texture, but i think that's more me than how they cooked it.  my friend and co-worker loved her surf and turf - i tried the turf offering and it was definitely among the butterier, tastier tenderloins of my recent memory.    Chocolate souffle was a little much richness on top of everything else, but somehow, we managed to eat it all :) the coffee was also rich and fantastic, and came with those raw sugar lumps that i just want to dump out of the bowl and into my pocket for later.  the bill was not unreasonable for what we had once you take the view and service into account.  very lovely meal.",

Of note though is the noise level; we expected a lower amount of noise at this type of restaurant, but this is typical of everywhere we go in Vegas and the place was packed. A hint would be to request a window table when making reservations or a booth if in a larger group.

I'm glad I was wrong - The Eiffel Tower restaurant ended up being one of the top overall meals I've had in a long time. We were seated right up against the window overlooking the Bellagio Fountains.  Seating (even if you have reservations) happens on the fly when you arrive based on available tables.  So try to get there early if you want a window table.  View was everything you'd expect.  Guys - you cant go wrong taking your ladies here just for this amazing view - very romantic.  The breads they serve you were all top notch, along with a couple of appetizers we had brought out.  I ordered a filet and crabcake combo...my steak was perfect and the crabcake was flawless.  All the sides we ordered were also excellent.  We also ordered duck, which was cooked perfectly, and seasoned just right.  We couldnt fit in dessert, so I dont know what that was like here.   Service was impeccable and truly beyond ordinary.  Felt like our minds were being read the entire meal.   Bottom line:  yes it's expensive, yes it has a nice view, and yes,the Eiffel Tower Restaurant is absolutely worth it.",

I asked if I could get a vegetarian plate instead of the flat iron steak dinner and the chef happily obliged. Oddly, for me, the things I enjoyed the least were the complimentary mushroom flan (blah, only was to describe it) and the baked puffed dinner roll (lackluster, not a french baked treat I was looking forward to). The appetizer for the menu was a small salad and a nice size portion of spinach strussel. That was very good. My lunch entree (the one the chef made special for me) was crepes stuffed with artichokes and mushrooms and onions with a marinara sauce and basil pesto (?). It was very tasty. The dessert was also very good. I didnt think I would like basil flavored ice cream but it was refreshing and hit the spot after lunch. Overall I enjoyed my meal but I dont think it's a place I would come back to. For what they charge, there are much better places that I'd rather go to.",

APPETIZERS: I am a big fan of foie gras and couldn't help ordered their cold foie gras torchon and the warm duck foie gras as appetizers just to try them out.  Turned out both were excellent, though, this time the foie gras torchon easily won over the warm foie gras in both texture and flavor.   Spring greens salad was fresh and crisp.  Escargots was short of spectacular, not recommended.    ENTREES: Muscovy Duck Breast - haven't had such tender and well prepared duck breast for a long time.  The dish was done just right.   Aged NY Steak - Perfect at medium rare.  great taste and portion for any carnivore out there.   DESSERTS: Souffle, souffle, souffle - excellent, excellent, excellent! MUST ORDER! Had two more deserts but can't remember what they called, one was Flambe Meringue with sorbet inside, and one had two crisp almond thins sandwiched some fresh cream and raspberries.  I was surprised their desserts was light and not overly sweet that I think most guys will enjoy them as well.   High recommended if you'd like to spend a romantic evening with someone special.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I dined here on March 18 to top off our Vegas vacation and they did not disappoint.   I had read a review on Yelp about contacting Jennifer (manager) beforehand about specifics on our reservation. We requested for a table with a great view of the Bellagio Fountains, and when we got there, our table had the best view in the house. (There is a picture of it on their facebook page--it's almost the very first table in front of the fountains).  Jennifer also stopped at our table and she really knows how to make sure that a dinner becomes an experience that we will never forget. I honestly got so thrilled with the atmosphere of the restaurant that everything else that came with it made the night perfect. At first, I was a bit nervous about contacting the manager and making a request since it is a popular spot and almost everyone wants a great table, but it really doesn't hurt to ask :)   Tips: get a table around 530 to 6pm-ish because the restaurant is not packed when we got there--plus, that was right around sunset so we had a nice palette of colors to watch; the scallop/oxtail appetizer was perfect and fresh; and the chocolate souffle just melts in your mouth, it's really worth waiting 20 minutes for dessert :)   This is my very first review here on Yelp, I just thought I would shower this restaurant with compliments because they deserve it. Like I said, it wasn't just the amazing french dinner, but the whole thing was about experiencing the best customer service, a romantic ambiance, and the best view of the Strip. Thank you so much Jennifer and the rest of the staff at Eiffel Tower Restaurant!",

They really helped make the meal. I am taking off half a star for the prices and another half for the dress code policy. I was really disappointed that they didn't enforce the dress code. People were there in t shirts and jean which took away from the ambiance a bit.",

    "text": "My fiance treated me to a romantic dinner during our trip to Las Vegas.  We stayed at the Paris Hotel so we decided to try the Eiffel Tower Restaurant.  He made reservations on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.OpenTable.com&s=56f811c7401f0e61499895bbed3d443e04df46954fb085e7eff5958030ea0aa2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenTable.com</a>. This restaurant requires a credit card for reservations and if canceled they will charge $50 to your cc.  However, if you need to make changes you can call the restaurant directly rather than going through OpenTable.  We were seated next to the floor-to-ceiling window that boasted a beautiful view of Bellagio's water show. VERY romantic.  We started off with a bottle of rose champagne.  Their wine list is spectacular, it's more like a book.  After flipping through 10+ pages I decided to go back to the front and picked a bottle. =P  We also wanted an order of fresh oysters on the half shell but the restaurant did not receive any 'good quality' oysters that day so they weren't available.   HIS: Sauteed Veal Medallions with Braised Vegetables & Wild Mushrooms = 4 stars  HERS: Filet Mignon with Lemon Parsley Butter Sauce = 4 stars  SHARED: Potato Gratin = 2 stars Chocolate Souffle = 5 stars  My filet mignon was cooked to perfection and paired well w/the lemon parsley butter sauce.  It was much bigger than I expected and even though my fiance had a few bites, I still couldn't finish it.  I tried his dish and the veal medallions were tender and soft. Very delectable sauce w/veggies too.  The side of Potato Gratin was reasonably priced at $9 but it was below average.  My version of this dish is 10x better, I'm not kidding.   To end the meal, we went with a Chocolate Souffle and it was absolutely divine!!  They had many versions of the Souffle, such as: Banana Souffle, Grand Marnier Souffle, Pistachio Souffle, and a couple more that escape my mind.  Service was top-notch.  From the moment we got on the elevator to the moment we left. 5+ STARS for great customer service & attentiveness.  ON A SIDE NOTE: we returned to the Eiffel Tower Restaurant the next evening to have drinks at the bar.  They have a cocktail called \"Eiffel Affair\" and at $20 a pop it was worth every penny!  It resembled a sangria except that it was sparkling and 100x better.  It is also mixed with Stoli Blueberi which gives it a nice kick. MUST TRY!",

Upon initial tour of the venue by the ever gracious event hostess who showed me around the restaurant and the cuisine art room (my very own preferred reference to any \"kitchen\") prior to booking the date of event, I was informed of a table that just may leave you breathlessly full of romance and love...a table for two, that is for the romantic in each of us...

The experience: As soon as you get off the elevator you have a view of the kitchen and are greeted by hostesses.  We requested, and were seated at a window seat that overlooked the Bellagio fountain - amazing views!  The waiter and staff addressed us by our name and were very attentive and helpful.  The flavors were excellent - we enjoyed a spring salad with hints of grapefruit, cream of English pea soup, the halibut was outstanding, and the filet was cooked perfectly with a delicious red wine sauce adding to the flavor. The side of potatoes au gratin were delicious as well.  The chef sent us a beautifully presented chocolate desert (kind of something between pudding and ice cream) it was rich and delicious.  We highly recommend this place and will definitely return if we come back to Vegas",

Sadly, they lived up to an overpriced tourist trap. My husband booked a lovely window seat for our Anniversary. They knew it was our special day but, never acknowledged it at any point during our experience. The service and food was mediocre for the price point. I specifically told the waitress my husband did not like fish especially anchovies but, reassured me the Caesar salad was very mild with hints of anchovies (We are both well aware there are trace amounts in the dressing already). When the salad arrived, it have several large pieces of anchovies on top. We had to flag down our waitress and get a basic salad replacement. I choose the fish which was underwhelming but, I was hungry. We had to search for our waitress several times (asking other servers and bussers) to get simple things like refills and more bread. The chocolate souffle tasted like non sweetened cocoa fluffy cardboard. To top it all off, there was a crying baby near us the entire time and a gentleman on his phone next to us. On our way out, we saw several kitchen staff just standing around staring at people entering and exiting the elevator; no \"hello\", \"goodbye\" or \"thank you\". I've lived in Paris and this place is an embarrassment to the people and food of France.",

This was truly a night on the town, a dinner du jour, a supremely satisfying and sensational dining experience, and one of the top 5 dinners of my life!  We came for my boyfriend's birthday dinner and enjoyed, strike that, SAVORED every minute of it. It was truly divine. The view. The Bellagio fountains. The ambiance. The drinks. The wine. The chocolate souffle with cascading chocolate. The cauliflower puree to cleanse the palette. The complimentary birthday chocolate mousse for my boyfriend on his special day :) The over-the-top service on all levels. The silver platter to carry our wine glasses to our dining table. The romance. The etiquette. The savory flavors melting on your tongue. This is culinary heaven folks!  From the dramatic entrance by way of the elevator, stepping out to a hostess waiting to greet you, seeing the immaculate, sparkling kitchen, to the adjustment your eye makes from the bright kitchen to the romantic dimly-lit sunken dining room with the sensational view, it was wonderful from start to finish. Not to mention THE FOOD! It was all fabulous. Utterly fabulous. While expensive (we rarely eat at these prices and totally splurged this time), it was worth every penny and I would have even paid more! We left a huge tip.  What a pleasure to dine here. We loved it so much.  As a same-sex couple, it was 100% welcoming and full of love for us. Unlike other establishments where we have felt judged or awkwardness in general, they were warm and welcoming, treating us with the respect we deserve (just like any other couple or family is want to expect).  I recommend the Eiffel Tower Restaurant extremely extremely highly. It was sensational.  A trip to Vegas isn't complete without a dinner here. Go, enjoy, and revel in its magnificence!",

I would drink some of my tea and would think to myself....\"hmmm...I think I need more tea\" and a guy would be there with another bottle before I even ask for it.  I would think to myself \"hmmm.....it would be nice for a little taste compliments of the chef\" and whamo...right in front of me.  I have no idea what it was that they gave me...some infused something or other...but it was amazing...and free....and compliments of the chef.  Then we were prepared to order dinner.  I had the snapper before so I didn't want to get that again...although it was amazing.  I wanted to expand and try something new.  I saw Arctic Char on the menu.  Strange name....Arctic = Cold and Char = Hot.  I have no idea what type of fish this will be....and once again the waiter says \"you probably are not familiar with Arctic Char....it  tastes a little like a trout and salmon mixed together.\"  Well I be damned if it didn't taste exactly like a trout and salmon mixed together.  It was great.  The chef even seared the skin to make it crispy...which is extremely hard to do without drying out the fish.  Then dessert time.  I ordered the creme brule and my fiance ordered some banana thing.  She asked me if it would be good...and I just said \"come on...stop asking stupid questions...of course it will unless you are allergic to bananas.\"  We inquired about the gelato briefly with the waiter and he told me the gelato is great.  I still wanted my creme brule and she wanted the banana...so gelato will have to wait I guess.  Guess what!?  They send us out this big painter's pallete dish full of one scoop gelato flavors...about 10 of them or so...as a compliment for visiting the restaurant again!  Awesome right?    I am not a high-roller by any stretch of the imagination, and the restaurant is not affiliated with Caesar's entertainment.  I imagine they rent or have purchased the space in the Eiffel Tower.  What they do is they make great food and have great service.  I will say they have the greatest service...and that is a FACTUAL statement.  I have visited other fine dining restaurants in Vegas and elsewhere and they cannot hold a candle to this place.  They treat you as though you are the only customer...but they do not treat you as a customer.  They treat you as a friend that appreciates great food and they know how to deliver.  Without a doubt this is the place I will always visit when in Vegas.",

I have been coming to vegas for years but always ate at buffets or just fast food. Being it was my 30th birthday me and my boyfriend wanted something romantic.   We called the restaurant to make a reservation for the next day. They were very polite over the phone. The next day we were running late for dinner so we called to let them know. When we got to the elevator we were greeted then getting off the elevator a girl walked us over to check in. The lady who checked us in was very nice and told me happy birthday. We were seated at the window with a view of the cosmo hotel and the water show. It was beautiful.  Our waiter came over and gave us the menu and asked if we wanted water. We also ordered a glass of wine. When we were waiting for our food they brought us bread and butter and something that was white I think he said cauliflower something lol. It was amazing. For our appetizer we got the pork belly. OMG it was so amazing! Then we got our food. I ordered the roasted farm raised chicken and my boyfriend ordered the beef wellington. They were perfect portions for us and so amazing. The staff was very very attentive without being too much. They kept filling my water which was nice being I was a little hungover from the night before. At the end of the night they gave me a chocolate mouse that had happy birthday written on the plate. Everything from the staff, the views and the food was perfect. I'm so beyond happy with my experience there and will definitely be coming back for another occasion. Our bill was $195 and worth every penny. Thank you for making my birthday perfect!",

The reason why I gave it only 2 stars was because of my meal. I ordered the rack of lamb. It was seasoned well and very tasty. Problem was they gave TWO small lollipop ribs!! The dish cost 48$ and they give you 2! On top of that, one of the lollipops was mostly fat! I made the mistake of not complaining. It was literally a few bites of meat for fifty bucks...so not worth it! I've been to steak houses in NYC and other places and they always give 4-6 lollipops.

To start: if you come here, be prepared to spend a good chunk of money... especially if you plan to have any wine.    I think the prices on the wine list is what really made me want to run out backwards, but the quality of wine is absolutely fantastic!!  Not sure if the wine we had was really worth the $120 a bottle, but it's one of those special occasion/once in a lifetime meals.  And the wine was phenomenal and didn't give me a headache the next day :)  The food is absolutely amazing!! Get anything on the menu.  It doesn't matter.  It will knock you off your feet!  I love the amuse-bouche that is included with your meal.    The service was impeccable, as was to be expected.  I liked the pace the wait staff made the dinner flow: not too fast, not too slow.  Make sure to get the chocolate souffle!! You will thank me later.  I've only had chocolate souffle a few times before and this was by far the best desert I've ever had... EVER!  They serve the souffle with a side of chocolate sauce that gets poured into the middle of the souffle.  The souffle drank up the sauce like a sponge!  Lastly, make sure you get a seat by the window.  The Bellagio fountain goes off every 15 minutes and provides a fantastic backdrop for a fantastic meal.  So, overall... make this a special occasion night (if you have any money left when you're in Vegas) and enjoy!",

Everything was delicious and even though the servings weren't huge, we left satisfied and full. I had the chocolate plate for dessert and it was amazing! The service was very good. We never felt like we were waiting too long, or not long enough. We had a table right along the fountains, the view was amazing. The only disappointment I had was being charged 16 dollars for tea and espresso. I guess it was my mistake for not asking if it was complementary, but I have never been to a fine dining restaurant where I am paying 300+ for two people and having to pay for tea and coffee. Oh well, will skip it next time.",

I was so excited to be able to see the Bellagio fountains go on right as we sat down and saw it twice more after that, so I guess we were there for an hour and a half. (the only bad thing about our meal... it took so long to get our food).  We came here for breakfast for our anniversary. First they give you a corn thing almost like a pudding, but it was sweet and a nice touch. We were also given small bread puffs that were delicious! I had the souffle which was really good. It was a little bit hard at the bottom, seemed like a croissant type of thing. I really loved the top though, very light and delicious. The egg popped just perfectly over it all. It doesn't look very big but it was quite filling! Boyfriend had eggs Benedict. That was pretty good too, but how can that be bad at a high class restaurant? I had a strawberry lemonade that tasted like strawberries crushed in my cup. It was very strong and not very watery so it was gone real fast. I would not order that again... not worth 7 bucks.  At the end, we had some chocolate flutes rolled in powdered sugar and they weren't too sweet with dark chocolate on the inside. They also brought out a nice chocolate pudding out for our anniversary which was really nice. This place is very nice and romantic!! The service here is great! Constantly filling waters and making sure everything is okay.",

    "text": "When dining on the strip, your options are limited to, buffets, celebrity chef restaurants and large tourist traps that are ridiculously overpriced and well.... just shitty.  I honestly expected the same of Eiffel Tower after my last stint here in Vegas at Le Cirque.  I HATED that restaurant.  Ugh... The food was astonishingly bad and the service well... Let me put it this way, I was about to get all Mayweather on it's ass.  Anyway... Moving on...  The name alone screams TOURIST TRAP  but don't let that fool you.  Once you hit the elevator on the first floor, you're greeted by a young lady whom then leads you to the restaurant floor where the doors open to an impressive open kitchen.   Once you step out, you are greeted with cheerful faces that lead you to a window table, overlooking the water shows of Bellagio.  For a minute, you might forget how cheesy this all is and actually enjoy all the twinkling lights of this faux city.  Starting from the amuse bouche to the entree, I loved every morsel.   I'd highly suggest sticking with the NY Strip.  It was just divine.  This steak was my 2nd favorite of all time, after Mastro's BH.  Perfectly charred and beautifully bloody.  Just the way I like it.  Don't bother with sauces.  This beauty doesn't have anything to hide.  Also a must is the Blue Cheese Souffle.  TRUST ME, you'll want to lick the plate.  What really surprised me was the service.  In Vegas, you don't expect this kind of 5 star treatment.  Most places here treat you like cattle, even the $$$$ restaurants.  They don't give 2 shits about you because they've got a hundred other diners to take your place, but not here.  Our waiter would magically appear whenever we needed anything but was never intrusive.  The staff truly seems to appreciate their jobs.  It was never \"stuffy\".  From the front desk, to the bussers, to your waiter, they all serve you with a smile.  A very comfortable, beautiful setting with a sincere appreciation for fine dining.  I go to Vegas about twice a year on business and Eiffel Tower will surely be where you find me on every trip.",

We know it was going to be expensive so the sticker shock wasn't as bad for us.  We each ordered a main dish, a side, and 1 drink.  This was about $75 each person.  We passed on sweets because we were both full.    The food was really good and my wine was delicious. The view was good.  We were sitting to the side against the window so had great views.    My biggest complaint was that the tables were small.  I felt very cramped.  When I went to stand up I felt that I was hitting everything/anybody around me.  I also felt like I was sitting on top of the person at the table next to me.  I know they do this to maximize guests who can be there at the same time but I felt it took away from the ambiance of the restaurant/experience.",

They had a kids menu -- I'll add a star for that one: just because you have a family does not mean your days of eating at gourmet restaurants is over!  The 5-star dishes: escargot on a creamy sauce on top of a what tasted like a potato cake was heavenly. I'd order that again. Foie gras was what one would expect; melt in your mouth decadence, if you like this sort of thing. This is hard to cook -- as it might melt before your eyes if you try this at home.   4-star dishes: filet mignon was tender, juicy and simply cooked well.  I don't know what to say about the venison. It was served cold-blood rare, and had the iron-y taste of grass fed beef except 10 times more intense, almost pungent and bitter like arugula on steroids. Other reviews of the venison here on were pleasant. Was this a new recipe? Is this a different species of deer? Was it the charred spice coating? The red cabbage on the side made it worse. The sauteed apples did not redeem it. I had a few bites and did not touch the rest.",

The service was great and the food here was A LOT better than before.  I am not sure if they have changed the menu, but the food was definitely an improvement.  We ordered:  Appetizers - Smoked Salmon (not bad) - Butter Poach Maine Lobster (really good, get this!) - Alaskan King Crab with Melon (great as well)  Entrees Beef Wellington (yummy, the pastry was cooked to perfection) Broiled Filet Mignon with Foie Gras (this was the best part of dinner!) Crispy Potato Croquette (good stuff)  Dessert Chocolate Souffle (worth the calories)  All in all, service was great, food was actually memorable this time! Maybe it was the perfectly cooked Foie Gras that pushed me over the edge.  The view is always a plus here.",

The hostesses stood around and said nothing to us which wasn't too noticeable until another couple walked up behind us. The hostess sprang into action, \"Hi good afternoon.\" She said in a friendly upbeat voice. Both of our heads darted up, as we wondered why we hadn't been greeted. The hostess continued to engage with the people behind us, even speaking in their native tongue. We were appalled and highly insulted that we hadn't received the same treatment that everyone else seemed to get. We couldn't help but to think that the service we received before we walked into the doors of this restaurant would've been indicative of the service we would've received inside so we immediately walked away and headed to Mon Ami Gabi (where I'm currently writing this review).",

The view from our table alone, however, was worth the visit and is plenty reason to try this restaurant again. If you'd like to see the view without eating at one of the tables, you can purchase a ticket to visit the observation deck.  However, we were hungry and wanted to try their brunch menu so why not eat while enjoying the view.  Food was moderately decent. Yes, it's pricey, but this is what is expected in Las Vegas and the nature of the restaurant, right?   Service could have been better. Our server appeared distant and seemed to never smile.  The woman who helped clear our table periodically was very nice and sweet, however.   Go at least once to try for yourself. We went for brunch, cheaper price but same view. The views are still great during the daylight hours.  Call in advance and make reservations. If you can, request a seat by the window for the best views. I think we may visit again when in town.  Next time, dinner and an evening view!",

When you're walking to the restaurant you have to walk through the kitchen, you got to see the chefs at work and it smelled amazing in there.   My friend and I both got the French onion soup which isn't like the  typical kind you get at other places, it was very creamy and flavorful. They also give you an amuse bouche and delicious house bread with butter. By the time my entree came, I was already full. We also both got the classic eiffle tower burger and pretty sure that was the best burger I have had in a long time. The beef patty was pretty big and very well seasoned. Every bite I took melted in my mouth. The most moist burger I have ever had!!  I also mentioned to the hostess it was my friends birthday and they surprised her with a cute dessert!!

Super friendly and great customer service, which I'm finding is very hard to find here in Vegas. But, it does come with a hearty price tag.  We went on our anniversary and we had a great time! We'll definitely come back!!",

The service is slower than the escargot they serve as an appetizer. They take around 15 minutes to bring you butter, and then, you get to wait another 15 minutes for them to bring you a choice of bread to put the butter on, I kid you not. Then, after all of this, you get to lay down around $200-300 for the experience and that's before the 18%+ gratuity is added.  On the upside, you might get a window seat like we did and get to watch the Bellagio fountains, so at least you'll be entertained, while you slowly but surely starve to death.",

The service,  staff,  and view of the belagio fountains are all great.  But I would recommend getting a dessert and wine and nothing else.     Chicken- smashed and breaded/ horrendously soaked in frying oil and yet... Almost flavorless outside of some aged parm. I could barely choke it down.    Surf and turf burger -  how you mess this up is beyond me.  The crab was tolerable,  but the Hollandaise was bland,  as was the burger.    A general theme here was under-seasoning and extremely bland flavor profiles.    With so many great restaurants in vegas like guy savoy  or Robouchon,  or Picasso.... Stay away from this place unless it's for a drink and a view.",

The view was awesome and we never had empty glasses, maybe that was because they charged for the wine and water so empty means no money.  While the food was good, it was not close to perfect.  The lobster appetizer that I had was a bit chewy, seemed a tad undercooked.  The salad was very good and the rack of lamb was excellent.  My only take with the main course was that there was not any starch with it.  A nice mashed potato or something would have made it much better.  I had the rack of lamb and it came with a slice of tomato and egg plant.  While it was good, it just seemed to be missing something.  The Creme Brulee was very good!  I liked this place, but will probably never return, just due to the fact that there are so many other places I have yet to try, but if you have never visited I suggest you stop in.",

    "text": "I'm torn. The Eiffel Tower Restaurant is not deserving of 5 stars, yet it's not bad -- thus my dilemma. At the Eiffel Tower Restaurant, the view trumps the food. But since we're talking about a restaurant, food should always trump everything else, with the view as a perk.  When calling for a reservation, I inquired about a window seat. The man said the only way to guarantee the window at 6pm was through a special birthday dinner package, including a three-course dinner for 2, bottle of wine, professional photo at dinner, and an autographed restaurant cookbook. The package was an insane price, but since we were staying at another strip hotel for free, I thought, hey, we can spend something silly for dinner.  So here are my grades: -View: A+ (of course) -Presentation of food: A -Service: C (service was no better than what I'd expect at Applebee's) -Cauliflower puree/assorted breads: A  -Mixed greens/creamy French onion soup: A -Chicken entree: A+ (I never knew chicken could be SO tender!) -Salmon entree: B- (underseasoned and did not taste super fresh) -Chocolate cake dessert: D (frozen, not sweet and didn't seem fresh; the presentation at least made up for the cake)  While some dishes we ate (as well as the presentation and the window seat) were excellent, my main entree and birthday cake were disappointing. I felt a little slighted with dessert; to charge a customer such an enormous price for a fixed menu that includes chocolate cake as the only dessert option and to provide that customer such a lackluster dessert just doesn't seem right to me.  Our server was attentive and professional but pretty mediocre. She never chatted with us and did not explain the dishes when they arrived at our table. Similarly, the hostess in the restaurant did not acknowledge us until we said hello, and she did not say goodbye or thank you as we left. (The hosts by the restaurant elevator on the casino floor were great.)  We had a great experience since the view of the Bellagio fountains was fantastic. Unfortunately, not everything we ate was fantastic, and the service was average. For what we paid, I was expecting food and service that would knock my socks off -- and we didn't get that.   In the end, because the food and service were not 5 stars for me, I don't plan on returning. I'm glad I went, though, and I enjoyed my experience.",

Portion size for the rack of lamb is quite small, especially the grilled tomatoes. The chicken was well seasoned and tasted very familiar to something that I can't remember. Bread is served before the meal but it's nothing special. Dessert was too sweet as  I'm not a fan of sweets. The view isn't too great as the most I could see was the Bellagio fountain. One of my biggest complaints at this restaurant is the compactness of the booths. It was difficult to sit and get up and my chest was squeezed by the table. There were not a lot of room on the table for the many orders of food and drinks. Finding the restroom can be a hassle. Though comfort is lacking, the taste of the entrees make up for the discomforts.",

Pick your favorite sides, and save room for a souffle for desert. Several to choose from. Ask to sit in Michael's section. He takes excellent care of you. If you have any issues, I'll assure you it will be taken care of immediately and professionally. We were celebrating a birthday and they even had a special little chocolate mousse for that! The view is spectacular! Can't say enough good!",

The view from the restaurant was gorgeous. You didn't have to sit right next to the window to see it either. Windows from the ceiling to the floor made for a wonderful view of the Vegas night and the Bellagio. I ordered a salad since I had eaten at the wedding reception and was not hungry enough to order an entree. As simple as the salad was, it was delicious. Same can be said about the butternut squash soup. Since I did not eat an entree I can't give it a thorough review, but if the soup/salad was that delicious I can't imagine how delicious the entrees would have been like.",

It was definitely an interesting taste but it was good. I ordered the creamy French onion soup and it was the best French onion soup I have ever had. That is saying a lot because French onion soup is one of my favorite foods and I've had it many many times. I was scraping the side of the bowl with my bread. I got the aged Parmesan crusted chicken as my meal and it was perfect. It came with green beans and potatoes. For dessert, we shared an apple strudel. So good!!!  Price wasn't too bad. I think you're paying more for the ambience and the view. Which is amazing!   Our waiter, I think his name was Carlos, was attentive, helpful, and very nice!  Put the Eiffel Tower restaurant at the top of your to do list if you're in Vegas !!",

In fact, if you ask for a table by the window you get an unobstructed view of the Bellagio's dancing fountains.   The food is good. It is not Michelin star worthy (for that you will need to go to Joel Robuchon), but it is good. The service is attentive and friendly.  It is a great place to enjoy the views while enjoying some decent drinks and food.    We had a few cocktails. They were pretty good. For the main, I had the French Bucatini Pasta with trumpet royale mushrooms and aged parmesan. It was not bad, but I found it slightly salty.

    "text": "Forced to come here for a birthday dinner. As a local who doesn't want to be anywhere near the strip on a Friday night, I wasn't too excited. But, thankfully the Uber driver dropped me off right in front of the entrance to the restaurant (which is through the main entrance on LV BLVD). There was no line to take the elevator up. Once arrived I was seated with my table under a candlelight type ambiance. The view IS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL at night, it's a round two-tiered seating and my guess is reservation for the first floor with window view, even on the second floor I felt the view was spectacular with the Bellagio water show after 8pm. The restaurant was full and lively. It's not an intimate setting if that's what you're looking for. My waitress took very good care of us, she almost made us feel as if we were the only table she was servicing for the evening.  This is high-end dinning, expect the prices to be overwhelmingly high and the food is mostly seafood and pasta. The menu does not have a lot to offer, the appetizer we each purchased cost $60 a person for lobster, crab, a couple of jumbo shrimp and oysters - it was definitely all very good except for the oysters - but for $60?!  - NO, NEVER - under ordinary circumstances. I had spritzers made, that weren't very good.  I opted for a vegetarian dish and it seemed very salty to me lacking flavor or succulence. My family however, seemed to enjoy the lamb, fillet mignon and lobster bisque. Overall, for as much as we paid for the meal - it all seemed average.   My guess is, as a tourist, you will pay for the hype of having dinner in a nice restaurant with a great view. But there are certainly other restaurants in town worth exactly what you pay for.",

Pure luxury to be eating Caviar and watching fireworks at the best seat in Vegas.  I ordered the Bison Tenderloin and the lobster.  The Bison tasted amazing and I savored every bite of it.  The lobster was by far the best and most flavorful lobster I have ever tasted in my life!  Every bite was an incredible explosion of deliciousness!  This was my second time at the restaurant and I am a big fan!",

Our waiter offered us the special of the day \"mimosas\".

We made a reservation via Open Table, but I had a problem with the app when I tried to make a change, so I gave them a call and they helped me out without issue.  We arrived shortly before our reservation and were shown to our seats - a lovely booth for 4 that overlooked the Bellagio fountains.  It actually took my breath away for a second as I took it all in.    Our server was absolutely amazing.  I believe his name was Igor.  We are a curious bunch and asked him a lot of questions - like where he was from and how long he had been in Vegas.  We listened intently while he told us his story.   We also had a Somelier stop by the table to offer assistance with the wine list.  Everyone we encountered was fantastic.  Now for the food.  Oh.... the food.  What a treat!  For appetizers, we had the steak tartare and warm lobster salad.  I passed on the salad, but devoured the tartare.  It was amazing.    For our mains, we had the Queen Filet, Beef Wellington, Venison and the Rossini Style Filet Mignon.  For sides, we had the creamed spinach, the Galette of Potato Anna, and I think we also had the Brussel Sprouts.  The Queen Filet was mine and it was by far the best steak I have ever had.  Everything about it was perfect.  I also added the peppercorn sauce because it's my favourite.  The only complaint with the venison was the Chestnut Spaetzle, which I'm told was not very good.  The wellington and Rossini both received rave reviews.  We each had a cocktail before dinner, and shared a bottle of Pinot Noir with our meal.  For dessert we shared the chocolate souffle.  The only tiny complaints we had were 1) the bread is served cold, not warm.  Though delicious and 2) the spaetzle with the venison was out of place.    This was by far my favourite meal of the trip.  Made especially pleasant by the phenomenal service.",

It was like the best pot pie crust with a steak inside.  My wife ordered the salmon which was oven baked medium rare.  To cook salmon in the oven and get it to the perfect temperature is not an easy task.  I couldn't imagine cooking a steak inside a puff pastry either and having both turn out to perfection.    Lastly the service, expect to be treated like honored guests in a home.  It was very nice and all of the staff was extremely personable and happy to engage in conversation as well as offer great service promptly.",

We took him for the experience because he deserves it too. They were quick to send us a link with credit card information already asking for the tip beforehand. When we sat, my brother started getting anxious. The manager was quick to come to our table even though my mom had previously mentioned to her that my brother was special needs. She asked us to \"make sure he keeps the volume down\" he does not speak therefore has no other way to release his frustrations. My mom was extremely upset and the manager did nothing to repair the damages. Disappointed to say the least. Before anything we are human beings and we should have more respect and compassion for one another. Would not recommend.",

    "text": "My bf and I were celebrating our anniversary and decided to go to the Eiffel tower for dinner. We made reservations for a Tuesday night. Since we were coming from a show, we would be a bit late and they were accommodating of us.   We arrived at Paris and found the Eiffel tower restaurant elevators. We were taken up to the restaurant and it opened right up to the open kitchen. A host came and led us to our table right by the Bellagio fountains and the strip view.   We were greeted by our server and was handed the menu. We ordered the Escargot and Royal Osetra Caviar as appetizer. For our main dish, I got the queen filet mignon with mash potatoes and my bf got the beef wellington with snow peas.   Escargot- I love escargots! And I especially loved the sauce that it came in. It was very rich and creamy and a strong aroma of garlic. The escargots were paired with croquettes to help balance out the texture and flavors.   Royal Osetra Caviar- the whole dish was divine! The caviar dish came with a platter of assorted toast and baguettes as well as creme fraiche, eggs, and chives. I love the assortments that it came with, a traditional way of eating caviar. Definitely would order again.   The queen filet mignon- I ordered the filet mignon, cooked medium. I liked the filet but the outside was seared a little bit too much and the outside crust was a bit too hard for me. But my bf loved the filet and the crispy outside texture.   Beef wellington- My bf originally ordered the beef wellington, thinking that it would be bready but it wasn't. The outside crust was actually very flaky and light and airy. I actually enjoyed the beef wellington for that main reason, the crust. The beef on the inside was soft and moist and it tasted great with the flaky crust.   (So me and my bf actually traded our dishes because he liked my filet mignon and I liked his beef wellington. It was best of both worlds for the both of us. I also enjoyed the mashed potatoes, it was very dense and creamy. I could definitely taste the olive oil used inside)  Apple crumble souffle- After hearing about the great souffles, we decided to try it. I must say it was out of this world! It was so airy and light. I loved the crumbles at the bottom. I could taste the alcohol that was used at the bottom though. It was a bit heavier than I would have liked but the souffle overall was very good.   Our server was attentive and also gave us a nice anniversary dessert gift at the end. We were also offered petite four at the end of our meal. They refilled our waters and offered bread to our table.    Our total bill came out to be around $275 which was a lot better than I expected. For all the fancy schmancy places we have eaten at, I think this would be my favorite! The service was impeccable and the food was up to par. I really have nothing bad to say about this place. And the strip view/Bellagio fountains was a nice cherry on top.",

For brunch I don't think the reservation was necessary for brunch but perhaps for dinner. Oh and you should definitely request a window sit when you reserve. Anyway after checking in at the podium, you take an elevator to the restaurant. Elevator opens to the kitchen so you get a view of what's going on in there. The food was GREAT! The mimosas are great too. The meal came with the standard bread but also a small shot glass size soup. Amazing food + great service = highly recommend!",

Spend your anniversary, birthday or special occasion here because it is worth it. The prices are very expensive but the experience is immeasurable and makes everything worth it. The service is amazing. Food portion is great, and the taste of every bite is delicious & satisfying. I have been to many special fancy restaurants but this one is my favorite one thus far. It's so romantic, and elegant, you can feel as if you're from another country like France (because the restaurant is Eiffel Tower itself )  I recommend this to all couples celebrating birthdays and anniversaries or any special occasions. I think this place is also good for proposals! It is quite marvelous! Steak was a wow-factor, it was delicious! My favorite was also this cute birthday dessert they gave me. I think it was chocolate mousse. It was soooooo yummy! I wanted some more! Haha. We had an amazing and priceless experience here. This place marks my favorite fancy special restaurant! We are planning to come here once or twice a year for any given special event/day.",

But this if Vegas, people. Don't expect to take an elevator up the \"Eiffel Tower\" with epic views at TGI Friday's prices. You are paying for the food, service, and views :)  Ordered: x Warm Maine Lobster Salad - Beautiful presentation and huge chunks of lobster! Really enjoyed this salad. Portion was perfect for an appetizer. Don't order this thinking you'll get an entree salad.  x Slow Cooked Seared Octopus - LOVE! I order octopus everywhere I go and this one did NOT disappoint. On the saltier side, but bearable. I'm very sensitive to salt.   x Trio of American Caviar (Golden Whitefish, American Sturgeon, Salmon Roe) - served traditional style. This was just \"ok\". We didn't have a favorite out of the three.  x Wild Alaskan Halibut - Delicious cooked halibut. I must admit, it was a little overcooked, but the flavors of everything else really made up for it. Really, really enjoyed this dish. x Galette of Potato Anna - Obviously had to order this because it has my name in it... Think Au Gratin protest without the pounds of dairy. Super delicious. I think I found my new favorite way to cook potatoes ;)  The food was more like 4 stars, but what really stood out was the service we got. Our server was so knowledgable with the menu AND all the wines. So great when the staff knows every single thing about the restaurant they work in :)  The views are spectacular here. Right in the middle of the strip. Almost better than the Mandarin Oriental bar ;) Highly recommend for a romantic date night. Loved our experience here. Just don't expect Michelin level food...",

It has all of the key ingredients - ambience with a great view, knowledgeable and articulate staff, and sumptuous food with great presentation.  While I had a light meal with entree and dessert, it was definitely worth reviewing.  Server was attentive and helpful with dietary restrictions, offering an incredible vegan entree from their dinner menu - the Cauliflower steak.  It was accented with an olive tapenade on top, paired with the sauces, and kale chips - simply wonderful!  I was happy to be able to enjoy the baguette and the server offered oil and vinegar instead of butter.  Berries with micro mint was also a perfect finish to the meal.  For the carnivorous and seafood indulgent, they had some nice options, too!  My friend's seafood salad was a healthy portion and nicely presented.  It's great to go to a restaurant with freshly prepared and perfectly seasoned food and service staff that fully understands their role in making a memorable experience.",

    "text": "This place is no joke when they say it is the most romantic restaurant in Las Vegas.  Me and my GF decided to go to this place to check this place out for the July 4th weekend and had an amazing experience.    First the service is amazing.  We arrived and the person at the escalator showed us the way to the restaurant.  The servers were very courteous and knowledgeable about the food being served.  I asked for a recommendation and our server suggested the sea bass and it did not disappoint.  Our server name was George and he did everything he could to make our visit an enjoyable one.  Thanks George!  The food was overall spot on for me.  The sea bass was lightly crispy on the outside and very flavorful on the inside.  I also go to try fore groie.  It's supposed to be duck liver and it was fused with some cherries.  I am glad I tried it, but I will definitely not order it again in the future.  Just not my kind of dish.  We ended our meal with pistachio and gran broule souffles.  First time I ever had souffle and now I understand what the fuss is all about.  I am now a souffle fan!  Lastly the ambiance of the place is very nice and with a great view.  Make sure to request for a window view.  It is well worth the extra 15 minute wait.  I was lucky enough to sit at a window table and go to see the Bellagio water show every 15 minutes.  Then we enjoyed the firework show that was being displayed at Cesar's Palace.  It was quite a memorable night for us.  All this does come at a price.  Total bill for me n my GF was $200, but the experience was priceless.  I am glad I had the chance to dine at such an exquisite restaurant.    TIP: I showed up in a t-shirt and jeans.  Make sure to wear a collar shirt or else they will provide you with a jacket.  Also do not wear shorts because I saw some guy having to put on loaner slacks.    Bon Appetit!!!",

Waiters are frantically walking back and forth you can't even enjoy the view. Our experience was terrible because our soup was cold, main course ordered came 1 hour later and the waiter was probably the worst part. When I was going to order I asked the waiter what he recommended and he was really rude and short about it. Some loser French guy who hates his life. After our food took too long we asked what's taking so long he first said \"want to cancel\" then said 3 minutes which turned into 15. Of course we canceled and left. But the point is it was like he enjoyed it. As we left I saw the manger standing around I told him what had taken place. His reaction was a half ass apology. Don't waste your time and money in a restaurant that is going to give you horrible service. vegas is full of amazing places ... I'm surprised this place remains open. We were at stk night before ... Fabulous. Don't go here .. View is half ass. Service is terrible and food is limited.",

I read the reviews for this restaurant and decided that this was the place for my wife and I to celebrate our 6th wedding anniversary, and I was not disappointed!  First of all, I have to thank Laurent, one of the managers, for the fabulous accommodations that he made for us which made it a little more special.  The view was amazing!  We had an awesome view of the Bellagio fountains.  The food was delicious!  I had the halibut and my wife had the filet, both were very good.  The amuse bouche and chocolate mousse were very tasty.  We topped it off with the chocolate souffle that was amazing!  The setting, service, and the view were top notch.  I definitely recommend this place for romantic or special occasion dining.  We had a great experience and will likely go again.",

I had made reservations for dinner initially and unfortunately were not able to make it for dinner and when I called in they said to come in for dessert and drinks would be just fine. Well we got to the restaurant and a very rude and passive lady tall with blonde hair helped us and was refusing to give us a seat that we wanted claiming that it was taken by reserved dinner guest which was an absolute lie. Right than we were about had it with her nonsense and were heading out when Ridge one of the waiters stopped us and apologized for the misunderstanding and that we were able to sit there afterwards. Just after that Lloyd the manager approached us heard our complaint and was very apologetic for it and assured he would take care of the situation. I would definitely come back again for dinner I'll make my reservations with Ridge next time and make sure to completely avoid that girl as should all f you. Thanks for the dessert Lloyd you guys made my wife's  birthday absolutely wonderful",

    "text": "Was recently in Vegas for my brother's wedding and my parents, husband and I came here for a late night dinner. My favorite part of the experience is when the elevator doors open, they open into the actual restaurant kitchen! A great photo opportunity.   When we were escorted to our table we were so excited to discover we were by the window over-looking the Bellaggio Fountains! They were truly a sight to behold while sipping on my Sauvignon Blanc!  The amuse bousche was a cold cauliflower soup and was a nice way to start the dinner, as well as their gorgeous selections of homemade breads.  I ordered the cod done 'en papillote' with trumpet mushrooms and lemon. It is a fabulous presentation but I do have to say the lemon completely over-powered the mushrooms. My mom and husband had the salmon with a Pinot Noir reduction and they both said it was one of the best pieces of salmon they'd ever had. My dad ordered the surf and turf and loved the steak but said the crab was just 'meh'. I had a side of Brussels sprouts that were divine and we all loved the side of asparagus with Gorgonzola.    My favorite part of the meal? You guessed it... the Chocolate Souffle'. The souffle' was eggy, rich and decadent.   Notes:  Eiffel Tower is a fun excursion for the hopeless romantics when in Vegas. Watch the wine list, though, it's crazy pricey (I know, I work for a winery and the bottle prices are pretty outrageous). Stay with wine by the glass.",

    "text": "Called on Tuesday for a special occasion on Friday. Briefly explained to reservation-taker that I was surprising my husband for lunch on his 50th birthday and would like a table with an excellent view.   When we arrived, we were greeted by name (?) even though we'd never been there before, and since we were a few minutes early were asked to wait. Other couples came in, each celebrating something: birthdays and engagements. I was concerned that my husband's birthday would be just another ho hum event and that we'd be left in the dust. But no.  Service was stellar. Lunch menu was varied and food was tasty. Portion sizes were perfect: not the usual Vegas-strip-enormous sized plates but servings we could actually finish.   We ordered two desserts to share which I completely recommend: creme brulee and apple streudel with cinnamon ice cream, (both ridiculously delish) and afterwards, the waiter brought out a lovely chocolate mousse on a white plate which had written in chocolate \"Happy Birthday.\"  Couldn't have asked for a lovelier lunch in all of Las Vegas.  One thing you need to know if you're going at lunch time is that the Bellaggio Fountains don't start until 3 pm on weekdays so you won't see that. Totally not the restaurant's fault! But you might want to know so you can reserve at dinnertime if you'd prefer.",

    "text": "January 18th we had reservations for our party of 8. It all started out good but ended with a Hugh disappointment. First when we told the waitress we wanted separate checks for every 2 people she looked at us perplexed. We literally pointed and said those two, these two, us two and them two making it very easy for her, but again she looked perplexed. She was a blonde. Trust me I am a blonde and could have done her job with my eyes closed. Ok so let's move on. Next was the ordering. The food was very expensive, you could order let's say the venison but you then had to order a vegetable or potato dish to go with it.  Once we all placed our order we thought we were good to go. One of our group accidentally spilled her water and the water went across the table, leaked through the table to where I was sitting and drip by drip went on the floor it also got spilled on her friends piece of bread, to which the bread soaked it up completely. When the friends guest (mind you it was my brother and his wife, myself and my boyfriend and the others minus one lady we all went to school together. So getting back to this breakdown, the one lady asked for another piece of bread. IT took the waitress over an hour to bring a simple piece of bread to the lady. So after sitting for 1.5 hours our food finally arrived. Grant it the food was delicious but the wait time was horrendous. My brother asked for a glass of wine with dinner and had to ask for it again as it never came. I guess they went to the other side of the world to get it. After dinner came the checks. Can you feel the tension growing now? They had the guts to add 18% gratuity to all the checks and again mind you they can only do this on a party of 8. There were 4 separate checks.  My sister in law and I both got up, and went to see the manager. We told them the service was horrible, the food was good but should not have taken 1.5 hours for it to be delivered, we tried several times to flag a waiter or waitress but to no avail. We asked the manager how he was going to compensate us for our meal? He told us that he would take the 18% gratuity off and let us put our own tip amount in. We said fine. I told my boyfriend not to sign the check as the 18% was coming off and the waitress was redoing our bill. I guess the others didn't realize what was going on and one of them signed it regardless. We all agreed that the food was delicious and well done but we would not go back again as the service was horrible, the time waiting for our meal was inexcusable, and the waitress was indescribable.  I am being generous in giving 2 stars. The company was awesome as we the food and the wine we had paired with our meal.",

    "text": "What an experience! It's comparable to having dinner @ Pier 39 in San Francisco watching the sea lions lay there motionless. Yes. It's that epic.  The ambiance, decor, and 360 panoramic view is breathtaking. They should make their patrons pay just entering this place. But of course, those breathtaking feature do make an appearance on your bill listed next to your food items.   Service:  This is where the very annoying, yet True saying applies, \"You get what you pay for.\" There were at least 3 servers waiting on our table of 12, which felt really nice. The servers were very pleasant and willing to do whatever it takes to satisfy our visit. I was really appreciative of each and everyone of them.   Bread was served to each person individually while you choose you dinner items and enjoy your cocktails. I was surprised at how long it took before our server took our order, but once we placed our orders, the wine arrived and 15 minutes later all the appetizers, then 20+ minutes later the first course, 30+ minutes later the main course, and 1 hour+ after the desert. It was relatively nice to have that cushion to digest and tipsy chat.  I was definitely not use to the time and the leisure of having the time cushion, but considering the view, it was well worth it!  Food:  Quality wise, everything was amazingly fresh. From the oysters, clams, lobsters, shrimp and quality cut meats, it was well worth the $$$$. Our party ordered about 5 appetizers, all of which tasted good.   I ordered the surf and turf entree which is a new york aged steak with a crab cake. I was surprised at how simple it tasted. Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but it just wasn't fantastic or outstanding. If I were to grade it, the food tasted B average while the quality was an outstanding A.  After sobering up, I would really wished the chef  got creative with flavors and tastes. Using crazy herbs and spices to blend the perfect $$$$ taste, which is what we paid. Over 1800. The Eiffel Tower Restaurant is still remarkable experience I recommend.",

Hostesses were nice informed us it would be a few more minutes so we got a drink at the bar, very pricey drinks but they did have my favorite bleu cheese stuffed olives. Finally seated and they did honor my request for the fountain view, such a romantic spot. Our server greeted us an older gentleman but right away we could tell he was snobby and looked down at us since we were a young couple. Just brushed him off, for a starter we had the scallops, so delicious served with baby carrots and a  puree that I can't remember but oh man so good! For dinner I had the filet while my husband had the ny strip with bone marrow, to share we also ordered asparagus, mushroom & spinach along with pommes rissolees, these fried potatoes. Everything except the potatoes was delicious!  Just melt in your mouth delicious. Steaks were cooked perfectly, we were so stuffed. i dont know why my husband ordered a warm apple strudel because our server brought us an anniversary dessert which I noted in our reservations and we were in a food coma after that. I highly recommend this spot for a romantic dinner. Be prepared to spend some money but its worth every penny.",

The chocolate souffle was to die for! Our waiter was prompt, polite and friendly and the wine pairings were on the spot delicious!  All in all the place is beautiful and my fiance and I  definitely going back for dinner this June for our 8th anniversary. Its the PERFECT SPOT to celebrate and no other Restaurant will do.

Inside the Eiffel Tower looking toward Bellagio water fountain show as sunset...Man...Perfect place to take my girl.   Food...We ordered the Sauteed Sea Scallops, English Peas, Alsatian Pinot Gris Jus for starter. I ordered the Roasted Rack of Lamb, Tarragon Jus, Tomato Tart and Slow Roasted Filet of Atlantic Salmon, Pinot Noir Sauce. The scallops was so tender and soft and has a very great sauce. mMM..The lamb was out of this world. The sauce was mM and the juice when you bite on it omg it's so delicious. It was perfect, they cooked it very raw so if you don't wanna eat something raw ask for medium cook. I said medium rare and it came out like that and I saw other people lamb was the same. The Salmon my girl said it was amazing as well.   Service..Can't say enough about their quality in service. Our server made us feel at home and very good at what he does. We ordered a bottle of wine and he opened, pour and did everything with such grace. A handkerchief over his arms, pour it gently. He came by very often to refill our wine glasses. He really make you feel like you're at a 5 star restaurant.   The View...Wow I can't say enough. The reason I picked this place was the view. The food and everything just came as bonuses. Watching the Bellagio water fountain show was nice. The view of the strip was amazing. It was the most romantic dinner me and my girl ever had. If I am In Vegas I will definitely come back to this place. There are so many other great dishes that I would love to try. I recommend this place. 5 stars!!",

We got to see that they were diligently preparing the food. Our waiter was very attentive and helpful. He answered all our questions and gave us good recommendations.   We ordered shrimp spaghetti veggies salad, slow-roasted filet atlantic salmon with pinot noir sauce, roasted semi-boneless chicken with butternut squash, and char broiled filet mignon with red wine sauce. We ended up trying each other dishes since all the food looked so yummy. The salad came with 6-7 jumbo shrimps! The salad tasted light and healthy. My salmon dish came out to be perfect. It smelled great and tasted soft and amazing with the pinot noir sauce. The chicken came out to be the biggest portion out of all our dishes. It tasted differently from the typical marinated chicken we usually ate. Although it was smallest portion, the steak turned out to be excellent. It was medium-rare cooked. It tasted tender and juicy with the red wine sauce. For dessert, we had the banana souffle. It's the best I've tasted!!! Highly recommended!!! Our bill came out to be almost $400...it was because we also ordered wine and cocktails.  Overall the atmosphere was very cozy and romantic. They have a gorgeous view, and the restaurant itself is nicely decorated. Great service throughout the dinner. Two reasons I didn't give it 5 stars: 1) food and drinks a bit overpriced 2) small food portion.  MY TIPS:  1) MAKE A RESERVATION, SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT. (YOU CAN'T REQUEST SITTING ARRANGEMENT, I TRIED)  2) THOUGH YOU DON'T HAVE TO DRESS-UP NICELY, I RECOMMEND IT SO YOU CAN TAKE PICS. PLUS IT'S FUN DRESSING UP. :D (THOSE WHO WORRY ABOUT DRESS CODE, YES YOU CAN WEAR JEANS, BUT WEAR IT WITH A NICE TOP AND YOU SHOULD BE GOOD.)  3) BRING A CAMERA, SO YOU CAN TAKE LOTS OF PICS!! (LADIES- WHEN YOU VISIT THE RESTROOM, TAKE YOUR CAMERA WITH YOU. IT HAS A NICE ARRANGEMENT. ;P)  4) FOR THOSE WHO WORRY ABOUT $$$ AND NOT BEING FULL ENOUGH, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU TO EAT A BIG LUNCH FIRST. IF YOU'RE GOING WITH A PARTNER, YOU CAN ALWAYS ORDER ONE MEAL AND SHARE. ANOTHER OPTION IS YOU CAN ALWAYS EAT DINNER SOMEWHERE ELSE FIRST, AND THEN STOP BY THIS RESTAURANT TO ENJOY SOME DESSERTS INSTEAD. YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG WITH DESSERTS. (KIDS NOT RECOMMENDED BECAUSE THEY MIGHT NOT ENJOY/LIKE THE FANCY FOOD. PLUS I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING A KID'S MENU)  5) I RECOMMEND GOING WITH A DATE SINCE THE SETTING IS VERY ROMANTIC AT NIGHT, AND YOU WOULD HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF SITTING BY THE WINDOW WHERE YOU CAN SEE THE GORGEOUS VIEW AND THE BELLAGIO'S WATER SHOW RATHER THAN WITH A BIG GROUP.  Enjoy your food!",

The views of the Bellagio fountain are perfect. We sat down around 7pm and watched as sunset faded into evening and the fountains lit up at least four or five times while we were eating.  (Don't cheat yourself and get what you've paid for -- definitely get a table by the window with a view. Don't let them seat you in the back of the restaurant with a side view. Wait for a table in the front, make reservations for earlier in the evening, whatever it takes.)  The food was very good, but not like the best I've ever had. Get a souffle for dessert -- that was amazing. The service was good, but on par with what I would expect for a fancy French place.",

    "text": "My wife and I made the trek to Vegas for Memorial Day to celebrate an early anniversary.  Initially we had reserved at Picasso across at the Bellagio, but with the heavy traffic we were forced to find other options.  We've been to Vegas countless times so we finally decided to try the Eiffel Tower Restaurant.  I have to say, it exceeded my expectations.  The dining room was a great rendition of those Parisian brasseries.  Although there were a few open seats that faced the window, the hostess could not accommodate us due to prior reservations.  We were pretty hungry so at that point, it wasn't worth the wait.    As it turns out, this was a bit of a serendipitous turn as we were waited on by one of the best waiters I've experienced in quite a while in Rodney.  From listening to our tastes, he was able to recommend us two delicious red wines that paired perfectly with the dinner selection that we chose.   Before we even started, we were served a nice amuse bouche of chilled avocado puree.  It was a nice palate cleanser and a welcome bite after such a long drive in.  Wanting to maintain that French theme, we chose the Fricassee of Wild Escargot, Potato, Sweet Garlic Souffle and the Roasted Foie Gras, Rhubarb Compote, Alsace Spice Croutons for appetizers.  Both were quite tasty with a nice balance of flavors.  The Foie Gras had a great compote that offset the richness of the foie gras itself.  Escargot is definitely an acquired taste, but that said, the fricassee was equally delicious over the bed of potato.  In between, Rodney continually checked on us and talked with us like old friends that haven't seen each other for a long time.    The main course itself, we chose the Muscovy Duck Breast, Camargue Rice, Pistachio, Sauce Foie Gras and the Boneless Farm Raised Rabbit, Braised Carrots Confits, Mustard Jus.  Just delicious.  I looked for both of these entrees in Paris last fall and to my surprise, I just had to come to Vegas for some real French food.  The duck was perfectly cooked and the rice had a very pleasant hint of orange folded with it.  The rabbit itself was slightly crispy on the outside and the meat itself was quite tender.  (Those who have never had rabbit before, it tastes like chicken mostly but it does have another unique flavor to it)  In addition we decided to supplement with the potato croquettes and the gratinee creamed spinach and mushroom.  (We also learned from one of the French staff that croquettes are not French).  Amazing.  Slightly crispy on the outside and the middle is similar to a mashed potato texture, its something I haven't had before.  The only minus points were the creamed spinach was a little too oily for my liking.  Save room for the souffle.  Its a can't miss.  We chose the pistachio (btw, i love all things pistachio - macaroons, froyo, etc.) but I can imagine the other flavors being just as good.  The dessert itself is quite light and the souffle itself has a texture similar to sponge cake.  Afterwards, Rodney surprised us with a plate commemorating our 2nd anniversary with a chocolate mousse in the center.  At that point, I was quite full, but i did manage to get a small taste of it.  As with the rest of the meal, delicious.  In closing, as someone who visits Vegas on a consistent basis, I look forward to celebrating our future events at the Eiffel Tower restaurant and would recommend others as well to experience the authentic French food and delicious desserts.",

    "text": "So begins the most expensive meal in my entire life. $89/person, 5 course tasting menu at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant in Paris Hotel, Las Vegas. Was it spectacular? Yes it was. It was SO good. I've paid almost as much at other restaurants, but never quite as much which is why this is the most expensive meal ever. It was also the most filling and best meal!  My friend wanted to go somewhere with a view (not necessarily to go someplace to EAT with a view) and I figured HEY when in Vegas why not go eat at a nice place with a view. So we decided to go up the mini eiffel tower to have a late dinner (9:30pm). We had a late lunch at the Wynn Buffet.  Most of the entrees were close to $40. The appetizers were about $15-$20. So I figured why not go for the 5 courses for $89? It seems like an awesome deal. Triple the amount of food for double the price, essentially. The catch was everyone at the table had to do the tasting menu.  Course #1: Warm Maine Lobster Salad, Cauliflower and Romanesco It was simply delectable. For a salad there wasn't enough green for me but there was tons of lobster. The lobster was juicy and I'm glad they took the meat out of the shell for me already, lOl. I think what really made the dish was the sauce. It was creamy but not overpowering. I'm not a fan of creamy sauces usually because it's soo creamy and it makes me feel thirsty after eating it but this was just the right amount of creaminess. It went really well with the lobster.  Course #2: Cream of French Green Lentils, Braised Ham Okay when they first brought out the plate/bowl it just had this tiny chopped up braised ham in the middle and I was thinking... that's it? This tiny tiny piece of ham. And then the server said \"wait, the soup is coming now\" and this other person poured the soup into the bowl. The look of relief on my face? Yes, yes there was. However it was brown and that put me off cause I've never had brown soup, so I thought it was mushroom soup. (Yeah.. we didn't really remember what our courses were suppose to be because they take the menu away from you!). Boy was I surprised when it actually tasted good! That's all I remembered how it tasted, just good. I don't even remember the flavors. Just that I wasn't disappointed.  Course #3: Filet of Red Snapper, Salsify, Blue Kale, Marjolaien and Pine Nuts My FAVORITE dish of the meal & my life! It was SO freaking good. The red snapper was perfectly cooked. It was so juicy. I've had so many overcooked fish before and well mostly we like to deep fry the fish too. But this was just so good. Ughs, I don't know what those crispy things are called on top of the red snapper but they were SO GOOD. The best texture I've ever tasted. It was a great combination of crispy with the soft fish. The blue kale was great too! It wasn't overly salty like seaweed. This was a perfect dish.  Course #4: Venison Chop, Chestnut and Brussels Sprouts, Sweet Potato, Huckleberries Venison is deer meat! I did not know that. In fact when we were eating this we thought it was lamb. Wow. Nonetheless it was still a delicious piece of meat. I'm not a huge fan of lamb (mostly because I don't really eat it) but since it wasn't, I'm all confused. Because I thought the meat was gamey and a bit tougher than regular beef, so I knew it wasn't from a cow. Is lamb tough? However, reading about venison it seems that is the right texture for the meat. It's leaner meat than beef and has a tougher texture and tastes gamey. But I thought it was nicely seasoned. It really covered up the gamey taste. I only tasted a little so if it was suppose to be gamey without the seasoning and sauce I wonder how it would've tasted? Hms, I ponder. The sweet potato was a nice surprise. I thought it was mashed sweet potato when I first saw it but it's actually thinly sliced sweet potato. It was awesome! =) I'm also not a fan of Brussels sprouts but I don't know, I cleaned this plate and the other ones too. I ate EVERYTHING.  Course #5: Eiffel Tower Dessert - I chose Raspberry Napoleon, Vanilla Blanc, Manager Okay first off when they brought my dessert that little mound of vanilla JIGGLED. It was the most fascinating thing. I kept shaking my plate to watch the vanilla blanc jiggle, jiggle, jiggle. It was so hilarious. Yes, I am easily amused. Back to the dessert. Raspberries were sweet. There were tons of them. I love the cream filling. The coconut crisps were crispy and it was sweet and didn't taste much like coconut because I do not like coconuts. The vanilla blanc, although fun to watch, I felt wasn't sweet enough. It didn't have a strong vanilla presence so I felt like I was eating something pretty bland compared to it's partner the raspberry napoleon. Hms, maybe I should've eaten the vanilla blanc before the raspberry then it would've been tasty. Oh wells, I didn't eat it in that order.  Overall it was FANTASTIC. I would definitely recommend coming here but only if you decide you want to spend the money.",

But what really put a damper on an otherwise lovely evening was when my son bit down on a bone in what was supposed to be a boneless dish of rabbit.  The waitstaff was quick to send over a manager to check on him and take his information should he have needed to have anything done, but the damage was already done.  He had such pain in his tooth and jaw that he left the restaurant early to go back up to the room, which just ruined the meal for the rest of us.",

But reviews for the Eiffel Tower restaurant were positive so I decided to give it a chance. I had an early reservation in order to see a Cirque show so was seated right at the window facing the strip. Great view, although in order to maximize the number of tables by the window there isn't much space between tables. Expect to be listening to the conversation at the next table, and vice versa.  Service was attentive and food was faithful to True French cooking. Monkfish was excellently cooked, although the portion was small. The chef did serve an amuse bouche of a pistachio soup. Souffle for dessert was good, but not great. Petit fours are served with the check. A loud group at the bar marred the romantic feel of the dinner somewhat. Overall a cool experience but don't expect to feel like you're in France.",

Laurent, the restaurant manager whom I contacted by email before our visit, ensured that we had a fabulous window table with an awesome view of the Bellagio Fountains.  Our wait staff gave us attentive, patient service.  And the chefs provided delicious meals.  My husband deemed his salmon with pinot noir sauce \"the best salmon ever.\"  I was a huge fan of the Grand Marnier souffle and the expensive ($18) specialty cocktails.  Our four guests ordered versions of the filet mignon, and all seemed pleased except for the one who ordered her filet medium well (it was more well done, and therefore tougher, than she had expected it to be).  All of the sides (potato gratin, green beans, brussels sprouts, and mushroom spaetzle) were tasty.  The Maine Lobster salad was very good, though it's worth noting that it contained far less kale than I had expected, just a little taste rather than salad-like greens.  The meal was, of course, seriously expensive ($717 for the six of us, including tax and the mandatory 18% gratuity (the gratuity was, I assume, mandatory because we were a larger group)).  We knew that going in (the menu, with prices, is available on the restaurant's website), however, so we were not unpleasantly surprised.  If you can afford to ignore the cost, eating at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant at Paris Las Vegas is a fun, tasty, memorable experience (the views truly are unforgettable).",

From the matradee to the hostess to the server to the water guy we were treated with outstanding service.   While you can be more casually dressed here I do recommend dressing top the 9's to compliment the atmosphere, music, views and overall ambiance.  We were seated with the perfect view of the Bellagio Water Show and it was the best complement to our meal .  The only con I have has absolutely nothing to do with the Eiffel but one table of their customers. If you're turning 21, you are already drunk, looking for dinner, and you're in a group with 12 other 21 year olds please don't go here. Otherwise, if you're looking for one of the best places on the strip this is the place to go.  I'm not a wine drinker but if you are this is the place to be. There wine list is easily 20 pages with wines from all over the world. I had a few Bacardi Mojitos and they were perfectly done.   If you go here and order a steak medium, you'll get medium rare, your order medium well, you'll get medium. Just a heads up...  Here's what we ordered...with ratings...  Bacardi Mojitos (10 ea.) - perfect... Sweetbread appetizer (20)- small portion but incredible... Pea Soup w/ smoked trout (15)- perfect combonation and the smoked trout was to die for... NY Steak (49) - huge portion and perfectly done... Filet Mignon (47) - smaller cut but filling and perfectly done... Potato Gratin (18) - perfect size and best I've ever had... Chocolate Hazelnut Cake Desert (12) - perfect portion and the hazelnut makes this a great simple dessert.  Eiffel Chocolate Plate (12) - Sampler of 5 different chocolate desserts and each was better than the last. Incredible...  Food Quality: 5 star Spend-o-meter: It's up there...we spent 235 before tip (45)...for what we got, service we received, atmosphere, and view however I was expecting it to be much more. Value: I walked out feeling like I got the best end of the deal. Best meal and dining experience I've had in a long time.",

    "text": "Blech.  This place is an almost total rip-off.  Absurdly expensive.  The only obvious reason for people to book a dinner here is to watch the fountains across the street at Bellagio.  Seriously, the folks at Bellagio should charge some kind of royalty for the amount of business that the view generates.  Our waiter was in on the scam - he admitted that he wouldn't eat some of the items on the menu when we sent back the escargot app that one of us ordered.  My food ranged from poor to solidly average.  The atmosphere, despite the view, was so bustling that it was unplesant: waiters rushing all over and a too-warm temperature.  Certainly not what I would expect in a fine-dining restaurant.  The biggest insult was on the wine list where bottles ranged from 3-4 times the retail price.  When we left, we couldn't help feeling ripped off.",

    "text": "We have had Thanksgiving dinner at the Eiffel Tower four times over the last six years, including this one.  All of our prior visits had been superb in every category.  This was an exercise in how can we make the most money serving the least quantity and quality food to an unsuspecting crowd.  There were only two choices for an appetizer:  one soup or one salad.  My salad might has well have been dumped straight out of a bag from the local supermarket.  The turkey was so, so with a tiny amount of boring gravy.  The pecan pie was good.  I had been a huge fan of this restaurant and all the prior visits were worthy of 5++ stars.  The whole family was looking forward to this wonderful experience together enjoying excellent food, great service and unbelievable views.  What we got was one of the most boring Thanksgiving meals ever, great service and unbelievable views.  Prices were astronomical, but we were expecting that.  But wait it gets better, then they had the audacity to charge $6 extra for the souffle after charging $79 for the meal.  Unreal!!!  The souffle was ok at best (no one finished theirs at our table which had never happened before).  We were all so let down and we will never visit for Thanksgiving again. This is what a restaurant does just before it dies.  Don't bother.  I should have known when I booked reservations the day before Thanksgiving with no problem that something was wrong!!!  I chalked it up to the horrible economy, not so Vegas was packed yesterday.  Oh well live and learn.",

It was a Tuesday night so we didn't think they would be booked up but just in case I called ahead to see how busy they were and if we should make a reservation.  The lady on the phone assured us that they weren't that busy and that they should be able to find us a table but we didn't need to put our name in.  When we arrived, sure enough there were plenty of tables.  However, when my fiance asked to be seated, the hostess was very rude to him.  She spoke to him in a very condescending way as if he was not important enough to be seated and that we should have had a reservation.  It really ruined our love for this restaurant.  We decided to celebrate at Twist at the mandarian oriental instead and were treated with the hospitality one would expect.  We are locals and we will not be going back to Eiffel Tower.  We also will dissuade anyone who visits from eating there.  I'm really disappointed.",

The Arctic Char was light and delicate, however, there was an over abundance of smoked beets and foam. The potato croquettes were delicious, and the NY Strip steak was cooked sufficiently. Service was excellent. The souffle to end the meal was to die for....especially with a black coffee. Off to see the Jubilee show shortly.",

The cocktails we had were expensive but good, and the bartenders were very nice. We had the lamb and the beef wellington. I loved the steak inside the wellington and the accompanying sauce was great, but the crust was weird to me. The lamb was tender and awesome. The highlight was the oxtail, and scallops. So Beefy it was crazy, and it made me want to make it at home! The service was great as well. The souffle was good, i am not a souffle person I guess.

The view of the Bellagio water fountains (at night) was amazing!    This is a class establishment with a focus on service and it starts before you ever get on the elevator to the restaurant.  There is a gentleman on the first floor who helps you into the elevator and a gentleman that greets you as you exit the elevator to take you to the hostess.  The elevator opens into the kitchen so you get to see the staff working diligently to bring the food to the patrons' tables.  I was fortunate that one of the people I dined with was French and a wine aficionado; everyone agreed that the French wine he chose was an excellent selection.  As a starter, I had the butternut squash soup with double smoked bacon.  I played it safe with the entree; I chose the pheasant and wild berry risotto and green beans almondine.    Everything was outstanding including the wonderful breads that we were provided while waiting for our meal.  I topped off dinner with a caramel souffle... it was heaven in a cup.   The portions were appropriately sized for a French restaurant.  I left the restaurant very satisfied and very happy that I was invited.  It was truly a nice experience.  This restaurant would be a very nice place to bring a date for a romantic dinner.  I also believe that the prices were appropriate for the level of service and quality of food.  I look forward to eating here again next time I'm in Vegas.",

Our wine glasses were never empty--we had a total of 4 bottles.  They had a good selection of bread, server comes around to ask which one you want. Tried the foie gras---delicious.  They are known for their chocolate souffle but I am not a dessert person-didn't get it but others did and said they were good...you be the judge.  Really enjoyed it here and would come again.  The views were good from our table which was in the middle--suggest getting a table along the windows.  We had a good view of the Eiffel Tower.

    "text": "This place was recommended to me by a friend the first time I went to Vegas and was not able to go. On my recent trip to Vegas I definitely had to go. We made our reservations for dinner early while we strolled through the casino. The woman made it very clear that there was a dress code. We arrived for dinner 30 minutes before our reservation but were seated anyways. I couldn't believe the view its breath taking. Between all the Vegas lights and the Bellagio fountain show about every half hour I was mesmerized. When the menu came I was very intimidated and surprised at how small it was. The prices were very up there. This is the most expensive restaurant I have ever been to in my whole entire life I'm not much of a food critic. I ordered the filet mignon in the bearnaise sauce with the spinach and mushroom, the waiter did an excellent job answering my questions and helping me choose a wine. My boyfriend ordered the flatiron steak. We received an asparagus mousse compliments of the chef which I thought was very sweet I'm not sure if they do this for everyone. The food is a decent amount and all of it was delicious nothing out of this world though. I recommend it for a romantic intimate dinner a man even proposed to his wife while we were there (she said yes) it really was one of the most amazing views. The check came out to about $200 including tip. For the money I feel like we could've gone to another swanky Vegas restaurant and gotten a better dinner but it's just one of those things you have to experience. I was scared of a snotty establishment but the staff were all sweet and helpful.",

I wanted to see the inside and go up to the top, mostly because I haven't made it to Paris yet. The restaurant is very elegant and offers a great view of the Strip and the Bellagio Fountain Show.   I suggest making reservations and get a window table. Neither of which we did by the way :-( It was a last minute deal and it was on a Monday night, so we thought we would wing it. We didn't have reservations so we decided to wait at the bar and have a drink.   We ordered 2 glasses of wine, a Shiraz and a Riesling, whoaaaa $46!!! I made no reaction, which my girlfriend liked because the couple next to us that ordered 2 drinks, yeah his eyes almost came out of their sockets...lol. Anyway, we waited almost an hour and the bartender, JR, said we could eat at the bar, which we did. He was very nice and helpful giving us Vegas tips on restaurants and clubs. Also, there was much entertainment between the three bartenders as two of them kept making fun of the \"new guy\".   Once dinner finally came, it was excellent. I had the salmon which was cooked perfectly. Also has the asparagus which was great. In the end the total was $260 for food and wine. I would probably go again if I had a little extra $$ to spend.   Just a tip, it is a little upscale as I said. As we were going in, there were other people who had come back from their hotel because the guys were not allowed in with sandals or any open towed shoes. Ladies of course were allowed. I was wearing Dockers and a collared shirt. Most people were pretty dressed up.",

We were around the Eiffel Tower about 4pm and the security was nice enough to escort us up the tower and showed us around the restaurant.  Dress Code is enforced,.. so the boys had to go back to the hotel room and change :)   I would suggest in making reservations before coming to the restaurant.  I noticed quite a few people were waiting infront to get seated.   The view was breathtaking,. and I couldn't stop staring out the window during dinner.  We were seated slightly close to the window and was able to catch the water show at Bellagio.  We ordered the steak, rack of lamb, black cod prepared in a bag?,. a side of asparagus and cream spinach/ mushrooms.  The entrees didn't stand out to me, but the side order of the \"cream spinach/mushrooms\" was yummmy!  We wanted to order the creme brulee, but our waiter said they were sold out! x__X ,. we ended up skipping dessert =(* maybe next time!  Our waiter did bring out a special treat for the BIRTHDAY BOY!  As we were walking out to the elevator, I kindly asked a man to take a picture for my friends and I,. the man hesitated for a good minute and stated he was the photographer,. BLAHBLAHBLAH and took the photo for us.  He didn't seem to friendly and was a bit awkward,. it seemed like he was butthurt that I wanted to take a photo with my digital camera and not his,..

However, I did not like how most of that nights service was. I went with my best friend and our mothers. We are underage and are not legally to drink but allowed but our mothers wanted to order us a drink to have with our dinner. Our mothers told the waiter that they wished to do so and he did not allow it because it would cost him his job. TOTALLY UNDERSTAND! BUTTTT after he left our table he informed the whole restaurant crew and security and they watched us like HAWKS while we had our dinner. Very unprofessional and low-class for such a great restaurant. Props to the chef! but bad service.",

We were a table of junior senior citizens :) and our server TODD could not have been more attentive or friendlier...he just played the game with the ladies(..that we started) perfectly! 2 of us had the Parmesan crusted chicken which was outstanding and  2 had the steak sandwich that they loved and one had the trout and he said it was perfect. The cream  onion soup was a hit. We ordered all the deserts and made a buffet..ha the Creme broulette was my favorite but all were exceptional ' The specialty drinks were great. We got special deserts for our celebrations. Saying happy birthday and happy anniversary in chocolate on the plate. The star of the show was the service!!!  Todd could not have handled these crazy old ladies better!! He was handsome and quick with his wit!! My best birthday ever!!! Thank you Eiffel Tower restaurant!!!!",

    "text": "Last time I ate here was seven years ago for my first wedding anniversary. Eiffel Tower was my first high dollar meal. It was so good that I'm returning to give it the five stars it deserves. Here's why:  1. Very best view of the strip 2. Outstanding service 3. Amazing food at a (fairly) reasonable, fine-dining price.  4. Perfect atmosphere (great lighting, comfortable chairs, lovely windows, well-placed tables, unobtrusive music).  Compared to Renoir at the Mirage (which closed the year after we tried it), the prix fixe menu was half the price and twice as good.   The most memorable part of dinner was the Foie gras. It was love at first taste and I have not had better versions of the same dish since.  If you're just looking for a great view and place to chill, without dropping hundreds, hang out at the bar.   FYI, I think flip flops are sexy on men, but this place disagrees. Dress shoes are required for the boys.",

    "text": "Just tried Eiffel Tower Restaurant for an early Anniversary dinner. LOVED IT! Great place for a special celebration. The tables on either side of us were also celebrating anniversaries. My partner and I both had the tasting menu for $89 per head, and then ordered a half bottle of wine, and a couple of upgrades...like the Baked Camembert (could have skipped it), and the Chocolate Souffle (worth it!). Overall worked out to about $125+ per person. Somewhat pricey, but for the great Bellagio Fountain views, excellent service, creative and tasty dishes, and reasonably sized portions...it's definitely worth it for the special occasion. Tasting menu had: - Crab corn chowder - Pretty good, Nice presentation - Mediterranean Sea Bass over Quinoa - Very tasty, very inventive quinoa prep with chicken stock, champagne butter reduction and crispy shallots. - Veal with mushrooms - Only OK - Choice of dessert, upgrade charge for souffle - definitely worth the upgrade. For best views and ambiance (for couples, anyway), get the table right by the windows, and get there by 6:30pm (during summer) to get the full range of time-of-day views...sunset through night time...it's breathtaking. Definitely coming back.",

The place is an awesome restaurant the views are spectacular and the vibe is very romantic. The food was delicious. I ordered the beef Wellington which I've never had before it was really good. My girl ordered the steak and said it was the best steak shes ever had which means alot because we've had some really good steak in Chicago. The breads they came passing around were really good too. Bill was around $250 with tip which was pretty good cause we also tried like 3 sides. Afterwards we took the elevator to the top of the Eiffel tower which ended up being a catastrophe cause my girl is terrified of heights which I didnt know lol. She ended up gripping the wall for dear life she literally had tears in her eyes so we didnt stay long. Overall very nice memory though.",

However, when I arrived on that day, I was met with terrible service as my dinner did not go as originally planned.  I spent close to $1000 for this event for two people, and should have been given better service for a small piece of steak, some veggies, and soup.  I would not recommend eating here, as I went to MGM's Joel Robuchon the very next day, and received exceptionally better food and service for about the same price.  So for if you want great French food and service go to Joel Robuchon, as the Eiffel Tower was a terrible experience for me and I would not come back to eat here ever again.",

    "text": "My fiance booked a table at the Eiffel Tower restaurant last Sunday for a very important occasion--he was proposing! If you want to snag on of the fabulous window tables with the gorgeous view of the strip, they will only guarantee those table for reservations before 6pm. Otherwise it's fist come, first served.  Our reservation was at 6:30, and they were able to seat us by the window on a Sunday night. We started the meal with a strawberry basil mojito. It was pretty delicious except it was served with a metal straw, which gave it a slightly metallic taste. We opted to try the tasting menu at $98 per person to try a little bit of everything.  Honestly, I will agree with some of the other reviewers that the best part of this experience is not the food. However, my favorite part of the meal was the oyster in the amuse-bouche with caviar on it. Also, their baguette bread was actually excellent and probably the best I've had outside of Paris. Have some! The Maine lobster salad and the rack of lamb were tasty, but the corn soup and the halibut were sub-par.   For dessert we ordered the caramel souffle and the passion fruit meringue with champagne sauce. My fiance proposed right before dessert came out and he was able to pull it off discretely without causing a big scene luckily. Although all the tables by the window are very close to each other, facing out onto the Bellagio fountains made the experience more private and intimate. I was too overwhelmed to eat much of the dessert, but the little bit I had didn't blow me away at all.  The only people to really noticed we got engaged were the couple next to us who generously sent over two glasses of champagne for us since they were on honeymoon. The restaurant did absolutely nothing for us to congratulate us, which was a bit of a disappointment for me. I heard a statistic that 300 couples get married in Vegas every day, but these are still very special moments for people that should be treated as such.  Overall, this is a nice place to go to for a special occasion but I would not recommend splurging on the tasting menu. Go for the view and the bread!",

We were a bit early about 6 or 6:30, so the restaurant was not filled yet. We entered from the elevator right into the kitchen viewing area. Not sure of the reason for this, but it's nice that you can view the kitchen at work if you want to. But I don't think entering the restaurant to this area is the best idea. Anyway, we rounded the corner to a beautiful restaurant and bar area. The hostess greeted us and we were seated in just a few minutes. I think this was so we could take the place in for a moment (which we did.) We were seated near the far corner, about center of the Bellagio. I was excited as this was my GF's first trip to Vegas and this was the place to see the fountains. Unfortunately they didn't start until 7, but that was ok, because we got to meet our waitress, Alix. She was one of the most pleasant and professional wait staff I've ever encountered. She was on it from the moment she arrived. The Champagne was wonderful, as were the Filet and the Salmon. Finally during the meal, the fountains started. It was a great vantage spot and the GF loved it! Dessert was a small cake and ice cream. A great restaurant is measured by many things and The Eiffel Tower hit them all for me.",

He was super attentive, funny, and patient since we couldn't decide what we wanted to order. He also helped us pick out a fantastic bottle of wine that would compliment our entrees.   I ordered the \"Not your ordinary\" caesar salad as a starter and oh my it was so good. They make their own caesar vinaigrette and toss the salad right in front of you. The dressing was so good my friends were dipping the fresh French bread into it. For an entree I ordered the queen filet with the Bordelaise sauce. My steak was cooked to perfection (medium rare) and the sauce, oh the sauce was so so delicious especially with the side of assorted mushrooms I ordered.   We also ordered dessert and after dinner drinks. Everything was fantastic overall, and I would definitely go back again on my next trip to Vegas.",

Make sure you ask for a window seat facing the fountains. We're there for our anniversary dinner and got a window seating, just what we had asked for. The interior is dimly lit and that makes the ambiance very romantic.   Wine: They have a great wine selection. Our server was warm and courteous and knowledgeable on wine. We took his recommendation and odered a half(small) bottle champagne. We liked it so much that we ended up ordering another full bottle.   Food: The food was great. The lobster and salmon we ordered were well presented and tasted great. It could be better though, since its vegas and there's a world renowned restaurant at every corner of the strip, food is at par but not better than others. But hey, we're there to have a good time with a good view. No complaints with food.   Overall: If you are looking to have a good view of the strip/fountains while sipping a fine wine or a romantic dinner then this place gets my vote.",

My wife's salad wasn't any better than you'd find at an Applebee's like chain restaurant and her cauliflower steak just tasted like regular cauliflower for 30 some bucks. My meal was very tasty and the desert was good. Props to the sommelier for the good wine selection. I thought this would be a Vegas staple for us but I think there are better ways to spend our money while here. Very disheartening.

As for the food everything was beautifully presented, and tasted like heaven.  I think the pictures will speak for themselves!",

It was my first day in Vegas and my friend had planned a surprise meal for me, I had never heard of this restaurant and I didn't know the name of it until shortly after we arrived.  From the get go, everyone was so wonderful! The woman at the podium of the elevator, the hostess at the top of the elevator (who took our coats), the bartenders, and the restaurant hostesses were all amazing! Not to mention the service from Egor (one of the waiters). Everyone here makes you feel at home. Despite the amazing atmosphere and the great food I never felt out of place here. Thank you so much for your hospitality and amazing service!  The view we had of the city from our table was unlike anything else. We could see the fountain outside of Bellagio, and down the street to the Cosmopolitan. It was getting darker while we ate and it was amazing to see the lights come on in Vegas, for the first time, at this amazing view.  My friend ordered the tasting menu and the chef was kind enough to let her do it despite me not wanting to! I myself ordered the salmon.  My friend's first tasting platter arrived, but I also received one! That was so awesome of the chef and the waiter for making that happen! I was thrilled to have the extra food and to try the unique cuisine. My favorite thing on the testing menu was the scallop.  Soon my smoked salmon arrived and it was spectacular! There was SO much flavor. Some of the best food I've ever had. Nothing at this restaurant tastes similar.  For dessert we got the souffle and it was so so amazing! Everything here exceeded expectations and it was such a wonderful experience for me.  Thank you so much for making my early birthday celebration a memorable one. I would 100% love to come back here.  Atmosphere: 5/5 Service: 5/5 Food: 5/5 Cost: 4/5 (Actually less than I thought it would be, my salmon was only 49) Total: 5/5",

The group also went with a Trilogy of Imported Osetra Caviar which had Golden, Russian and Siberian- I never had Caviar before, my favorite was the Golden Caviar. For drinks, of course went with beer lol With the Caviar was a pretty hefty bill! But since I didn't had to pay for it, was worth the experience!",

The menu has great options, of course it is pricey.  We had the auld fashioned signature drinks and omg they were delicious. We had an issue with our food not coming out but they rectified it quickly and offered us dessert which was a nice gesture.  Our steaks were a little under for our taste but they were tender. The chicken was also really good. If you're looking for a special dining experience and don't mind spending a lot this is the place to go to.",

    "text": "The Eiffel Tower restaurant is located in the Paris Hotel right on the Las Vegas strip. While Las Vegas is now known as a foodie city with celebrity chef restaurants earning Michelin stars, the Eiffel Tower is not one of them. It does however boast a great view of the strip, including the Bellagio fountains. If you plan your dinner appropriately, you can watch that spectacular show. That might make up for the hit and miss entrees.   We stopped into the restaurant for lunch one day and had no trouble getting in. We were seated by the windows to enjoy the view and provided water and menus promptly. I had a glass of red wine that was so-so but my friend enjoyed her eggnog cocktail. She also liked her appetizer of avocado, lobster, shrimp, and crab. I on the other hand had the New York Strip steak and was quite disappointed. The first thing that annoyed me is that my steak arrived drowning in some sort of red-brown sauce. There was no sauce mentioned on the menu and I am not a steak-sauce type of gal. I took a bite and quickly realized that the steak quality could be compared to Applebee's. Seriously. The texture was off and the flavor lacking, which I'm guessing is why they chose to try to hide it with steak sauce. It didn't work.   In short, the Eiffel Tower restaurant seems like a very touristy dining venue and I can't recommend a visit.",

A lot of the times at touristy places such as this one, the food isn't always up to par, but throw that out the window because it's hand down delicious!   For starters we ordered the spring salad and butternut squash soup with duck confit. The soup was absolutely fantastic! The sweetness from the squash with the Crispiness of the duck was the perfect mix! For our entrees we got the chicken and filet mignon with a side of Brussels sprouts, potatoes au gratin and mashed potatoes. My mom said the mashed potatoes we beyond creamy and the best she's ever had. The Brussel sprouts were fantastic and the bacon mixed it was the perfect addition. The potatoes au gratin had the perfect amount of cheesiness to them! My filet was over cooked and burned/charred in some areas, but it was ok.For dessert we got the grand marnier and the apple crisp souffles. Very delicious and light. Not heavy leaving you overly full.   So why the 4 stars? Well because our waiter was not friendly and good at all! All of the tables around us, he went into detail about all of the dishes and their service was fantastic. He dropped off menus, helped other tables around us who sat down 15 minutes after we did, then came got our order. Asked if we wanted to put souffle orders in because it would take 30 minutes and we never saw him again until the check came. We had no idea their were other desserts! Really wish he would have given us more time and attention.   Overall, it was worth it! The food was great and the views of the city and bellagio foundations were pretty fantastic.",

We had been wanting to go to this restaurant together for quite some time now as we're vegas regulars.   We made reservations a couple hours before our actual seating time. They were surprisingly very accommodating even though it was an extremely busy weekend in lieu of the fight. We had a great view and were sat in a section with a gentleman named \"Guillermo\" who was our waiter and an absolute legend. We kindly asked Guillermo to send the Sommelier over, we discussed what we were having and we chose a perfect bottle of wine to complement our food.   The Food was absolutely Decadent. Steak with Foie Gras, crab oscar, etc, makes my mouth water thinking about it.  All In All this place is 2 thumbs up. But more importantly the service was superior to a lot of other places i've eaten right off the strip.  Guillermo told us that he worked his way up from being a busser and had been working at the Paris Hotel for 15+ years. His Candor, manners, and all around attentiveness is what really impressed us outside of the food. He's patient, kind, and willing to help you with everything.  Thanks for such a great dining experience Paris Hotel. can't wait to make it back.",

Reserve your table at 4:30pm, and you will be guaranteed a table by the window. It is a bit early compared to the conventional dinner, but it is TOTALLY worth it. The fountain view is amazing!  The food - We tried the lobster salad and the octopus leg for the appetizers. They were both tasty! My husband and I both thoroughly enjoyed the lobster salad and felt that it was a generous portion. We ordered Chicken and salmon for our entree with a side of wild mushrooms. The mushrooms were a bit too oily, but nonetheless tasted amazing.   For dessert, we had the nutella souffle, which wasn't too heavy.   As we were celebrating our anniversary, our server brought us a special Chocolate mouse dessert after our meal that said \"Happy Anniversary\" which was incredibly thoughtful of them. There is also a photographer walking around to take pictures and you can get 2 pictures (softcopy) for $10 which is worth it as the picture comes out pretty nice compared to a phone picture.

My date had the New York which she thoroughly enjoyed as well. We both split the au gratin potatoes along with brussel sprouts.  For dessert, we had a chocolate and a nutella souffle which were both awesome!   For drinks, we had 2 of their top 3 recommendations from our server. Mine had blueberries in it and hers had champagne. Both were awesome!   We made a 715 reservation and got there early. They were able to seat us immediately and we got one of the many table for twos that ran along the long glass window that had a great view of the bellagio watershow.  Don't come here if you're on a budget. The two of us spent just under 400 but was well worth the experience!",

Anywhere you are seated in this restaurant you have a great view it was built with that in mind! For appetizers we got the Steak Tartare with truffle oil and the Warm Lobster Salad Both tasted amazing. For entrees we got the 16oz Ribeye with Bone Marrow, the Duck, Salmon, and Chicken. All of which were cooked perfectly and delicious. For desert we had the Chocolate Souffle you have to order this desert at the beginning because it takes about 40mins to make and it was delicious and worth it! I will be back here next time I am in Vegas for sure Thank You For The Great Experience.",

Gotta love Motown and their love songs.  Headed to the Eiffel Tower Restaurant without reservations on a Saturday night.  Nothing like doing things on the spur of the moment.  Waited at the bar for about 30 minutes and were taken to our seats.  Wonderful views and ambiance!  Started with the Trilogy of Cavair.  Ordered the lobster and rib eye and shared both.  Would have liked a better selection of classic French dishes but the food was all very good.  Great place to go with that special person.  Not a budget outing but was well worth it.",

The first location that we were awarded by the window had a beautiful view, but the air conditioning vent blew straight down on us. I ended up getting a headache instantly.

We were sort of in a rush as we had tickets to a show so we had two glasses of wine and shared two appetizers, the octopus and the steak tartare. Both appetizers were good but not good enough to reflect the price. You are paying for the ambience for sure. They were very generous with the bread and the French baguette is my idea of carb perfection.   Of note, we did make a hilarious memory... we didn't know that there was a dress code (although we should've assumed...) and my boyfriend did not have on a collared shirt. They handed him this terrible, black oversized button down to put on. He looked horribly sloppy and we found it ironic that this was more acceptable than the uncollared shirt he had on. It was worth the laugh.",

Obviously the view in Paris doesn't compare but for Vegas standards it's pretty good.  I made reservations here on Open Table for a party of 7 for my sister's bachelorette party. You will need to put a credit card down to reserve here.If you make reservations and cancel less than 24 hours before, you will be charged $50 per person cancellation fee.   There are breathtaking views of the Bellagio Hotel and fountains. It definitely has that romantic feel. The window seats are reserved for parties of 2.   Upon seating a server comes out with a try of assorted breads: whole grain, white, French etc. and you can select as many as you like.  What to order:  Pink Velvet Cocktail $19- My sister ordered this and it was so delicious! Perfect girly drink! I liked it better than the Eiffel Tower Affair cocktail that I ordered  Eiffel Tower Affair Cocktail $19- I prefer the pink velvet, but this wasn't bad either. It's pretty much a sangria.  Crispy Loup de Mer- Tasted divine! I like that it wasn't heavy and you won't feel bloated after eating this.  Nutella Souffle $16- YOU MUST GET A SOUFFLE! This was incredibly delicious! It almost tastes like an egg custard! I wish I were eating this right now!  There's a restaurant photographer that will come around and take photos for you and you can purchase a souvenir photo for $25.  The Eiffel Tower Restaurant is perfect for any special occasion that you're celebrating in Las Vegas. I'd love to come back here with my man LOL Romance me baby ha ha",

My daughter and I decided to have lunch at this very fancy establishment. We had the corner window table right in front of the Bellagio Hotel fountain.The view was amazing, especially when the fountain show was on.  The weather was perfectly clear. I highly suggest making reservations on the Open Table website, lunch reservations are quite easy to make!   Our server was James, he had a great sense of humor! The restaurant had lots of great choices of food to choose from. The fennel cream soup was really great, my ten year old daughter liked it. I ordered the foie gras wrapped in duck prosciutto with fig compote. The best I ever had. My daughter ordered the steak, she actually finished it because she did not want to waste it. For my main dish I had the salmon, very moist and tasty. For dessert we ordered the Creme Brulee, highly recommended by James. He was right the best Creme Brulee my daughter and I ever had.   We will definitely be back for more of their fine dishes! I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to wine and dine someone special!",

    "text": "My husband and I dined here the other night to celebrate my birthday and what a great experience it was! I had called about a week in advance to make a reservation. To my surprise, they asked for my credit card number over the phone, which I have never done before. This guarantees your reservation, and if you cancel I believe they charge $50 to your card. A dress code is also enforced, although the woman I spoke to over the phone told me that jeans are allowed as long as they are not ripped up.   As others have already mentioned, you take the (small) elevator to the 11th floor where the restaurant is located. The elevator opens up in front of the kitchen. As soon as we arrived, one of the employees said \"What are you doing in the kitchen?\" He then gave us a warm greeting and walked us to where we would check in.   We had a great table by the window with a awesome view! My husband and I thought the restaurant would be higher up than it actually was, but it was perfect! We really enjoyed the view of the Bellagio fountains (every 15 minutes) and the strip.   What we ordered for dinner: -Maine Peekey Toe Crab Salad: with cucumber and black sesame seeds. Very light and tasty with a vinaigrette type of dressing. Good choice for an appetizer!  -Char Broiled Filet Mignon: with lemon parsley butter. It was cooked the way I wanted and easy to cut into pieces. It wasn't the best steak I have ever eaten, but I still enjoyed it. I also felt that the butter was too thick and it took a while to melt down.   -Aged New York Steak: my husband ordered this. He pretty much felt the same way I did about my steak. It was good, but definitely not the best.  -Potato Anna: as our side order. It was basically thinly sliced potatoes that were layered on a plate. Not much to say about it, but there's nothing wrong with potatoes cooked with butter!  For Dessert: -Chocolate Souffle: After we ordered our dinner, our server asked us if we wanted to order a Souffle because it takes about 30 minutes for them to prepare it. It was interesting when they brought it to our table. First they make a hole in the center of the souffle, then they pour in the chocolate sauce inside. I was a bit disappointed because it wasn't as good as I was hoping it to be. The cake was very moist and fluffy, but I felt that it needed more chocolate sauce.  -I was surprised with a complimentary Chocolate Mousse for my birthday! It tasted great and I definitely enjoyed it more than the Chocolate Souffle! I also liked how they served it on a plate with \"Happy Birthday\" written in Chocolate sauce!  Service was top notch! Our server was Pierre. He was friendly, entertaining, and very attentive. He made us laugh, smile, and really wanted us to enjoy our dinner! Also there is a photographer that walks around asking if you would like to take a picture with the illuminated Paris Balloon in the background. We decided why not, and liked how it came out. We paid $24 for a 5x7 photo. Ouch. I know, but it was worth it for us!  My only complaint is that the tables are packed in very close together. The aisles are also very narrow, so it takes a while to pass by other tables and to get out.   Our bill was expensive! But we definitely enjoyed the experience and our night here! Hopefully the food will be better the second time around if we ever come back!",

    "text": "We came here with OpenTable reservations and they didn't follow through with the seat views request that was made with the OpenTable reservation. On top of waiting for an additional 20 minutes for normal tables (even though we made advance reservations), we didn't even get a view. They said we'd have to wait an even longer for a table with a view if we wanted a view that badly. Since we were already hungry, we decided not to wait any longer.  Our order:  Market Greens ($18), Black Cod ($44), Loup de Mer ($48), and Pistachio Souffle ($16).   Loved the taste of the Market Greens - Avocado, sunflower seeds, sherry walnut vinaigrette. It sounds normal, but the taste was perfect! Very well balanced!! The Crispy Loup de Mer was also fabulous! It included spinach leaves, peanut potatoes, bacon and red wine lobster jus that was quite delicious!   A favorite that all can agree on: Pistachio Souffle!! I'm typically not a big dessert person, but wow...the pistachio souffle is mouth watering goodness!! And as a pistachio lover, whoa! Perfect taste!! I was surprised I could taste the wonderful pistachio flavor and of course the souffle was cooked to perfection!   Overall service was okay. Our server answered any questions we had but didn't think to ask if we had any preferences. Maybe he was too busy?   Let's just say, thank goodness the food and of course the famous Pistachio Souffle was perfect! If not...this would have been a terrible experience with one star. I am giving it only 3 stars because I may not come back again for the price that didn't correlate with the lack of service given.   When I'm giving a rating, it isn't solely based on the food, it's based on various aspects of the restaurant (service, timing, etc.). So, for $$$$ establishment, I expected better. Since it wasn't as great as expected from such a pricey establishment, I cannot give it the stars to match it's price tag.   If you need an example of a wonderful restaurant, check out my other reviews of a wonderful spot in Vegas that is $$$$ :D  Desole!",

A great place for a romantic lunch or dinner with your loved one.  The reason I'm giving them 4 stars is cuz  we waited a pretty long time for our entrees to come but that was fine the food was delish. I recommend the steak and eggs, the French toast, and the heirloom tomato salad. Definitely pass on the romaine salad it had fake chicken in it and make sure you get the three course meal for $10 more it's worth it. The frozen souffle was yum!!",

My favorite was the Meringue with Passion Fruit dessert!  OMG it was awesome. It  was one of the best desserts I have ever had.   The first time we went the experience was not so great it was Valentines Day and it was way to busy and crazy but they sure made up for that evening.

They have a chocolate mousse cake for the chocolate lovers that's really great--not too strong of a flavor such that it gets caught in your throat but will definitely satisfy your sweet tooth. I've also tried their lemon-raspberry treat on another occasion, equally as good with a raspberry sauce that compliments the dessert just like you'd expect. All downed with a Moscato and all is well with the world.  ... and the view of those fountains just makes for a lovely evening.",

    "text": "A lot of professional restaurant critics have called this the most romantic restaurant in Las Vegas, and I would be hard pressed to disagree.  The view is fabulous and unique.  There are several high-end restaurants on the Strip that have a great \"God's eye view\" from 50+ stories high, but the view here is more intimate - about 10 stories up and nestled right among some of the prettiest hotels in Vegas including the Bellagio and Caesar's Palace.  The interior of the room is also beautiful and (if I recall correctly - it's been a while) is modeled after it's namesake restaurant in the \"other\" Paris.  Three of our party had the tasting menu, and we all liked it.  Every course had flavor and flair.  Judging the food against it's peers at, say, Alize or Le Cirque, I thought the flavor fell just a wee little bit short, but that's putting it in with some stiff competition.  My wife opted for the regular menu.  She started with the scallops, which she pronounced to be excellent.  She also raved over a side of potatoes au gratin.  But she thought her salmon entree was not that good.  Still, there were a lot of other attractive choices on the menu, so the down tick on the salmon wouldn't keep us from going back.  My wife and I split a dessert of pastry, white chocolate and bananas, which was just fabulous.  The room was pretty packed on a Friday night, which slowed up the service just a little bit.  Still, the wait staff was attentive and helpful on questions, if not overly personable.  So that leaves the issue of price, and you have to go in with the attitude that price is not an issue.  The tasting menu is going to set you back between $200 and $300 per person - more if you get the wine pairings.  But this is a place for a special occasion, and if you can afford it I think you won't be disappointed.  If you can't afford it, try going downstairs to Mon Ami Gabi for some really fine French food without the need for a second mortgage.",

The sound level is perfect for either a group or couples.  Service - Outstanding. The sommelier recommended a fantastic champagne and the waiter also provided some great recommendations. Timing was perfect all night.  Food - The highlight. Started with the Steak Tartare which had great taste & texture with the garlic aioli adding great flavor. Scallop App was perfectly cooked with a great sear plus a great jus. Beef Wellington was perfectly cooked along with a great sauce plus the snap peas were perfectly cooked. The Alaskan Wild Cod was a great dish, perfectly pan sauteed with a ton of flavor in the Beurre Blanc. Brussel Sprouts side was full of flavor with the double smoked bacon and still had some crunch in them. Everything was perfectly seasoned and cooked.  We dined the night before at a higher rated French restaurant that didn't come close to comparing to the overall experience at the Eiffel Tower restaurant. It is on the high end of cost but the overall atmosphere, service and food quality justify the cost. On my next visit to Las Vegas this is now a go to restaurant.",

    "text": "Very pricey, but the food was only so-so. On the plus side, they had a decent craft beer list, and the waiters were very attentive. Also, the view is nice. But I would NOT recommend this place.  I went with a group for a business dinner. I had the squash soup first. ($18) It was kind of bland. Nothing made it stand out. A lot of money for a bland soup.  Then I tried the Venison, Parsnip, Braised Cabbage entry, simply to try something I don't often get. It was served red, raw and wriggling. OK, not wriggling, but I did not enjoy the taste or the soft, chewy feel in my mouth. It was not succulent or tasty. Just something to chew and swallow. For $54, I expected something far more memorable. The one thing I did enjoy was the Classic Potato Gratin side dish ($10). I should have just ordered that! Or maybe 3 of them.  One amusing thing, probably more indicative of Vegas itself than of this place, was how relentless the waiters were in \"suggesting\" things we could order. They are marketing machines. Even as we wound down with desert, a waiter was right there with a list of expensive dessert wines, just pushing and pushing them. And then when our host picked one, \"why not get two?\" Funny to watch.   Overall, expect to pay a lot for a nice view, and come away feeling ripped off for mediocre fare.",

Eiffel Tower Restaurant it is.  im always very excited to try different restaurant's lobster entrees and i seen this spot had the surf and turf for $64. me and my date go upstairs and get seated after about a 10 minute wait at the bar which had a nice bartender. the view this place has to offer of the strip and the water show across the street was awesome. nice waiters/waitresses and all that, but when i finally get my plate, the first thing i wanted to ask was \"UM WHERE THE FUCK IS THE REST OF MY LOBSTER?\" they bring out a measly piece of what seemed to be half of a lobster tail and a baby lobster claw. the portion of the lobster was very upsetting but was delicious and so was the prime beef strip loin. the portion of the beef had to be only about 4oz. total. if you decide to come here, DON'T GET THE SURF AND TURF. way too overpriced for a small ass portion.",

    "text": "It was a Vegas trip that I organized for my boyfriend who finds Vegas boring and pricey restuarants high on show and low on taste. Well it all changed when we went to Eiffel Tower. We loved it right from getting into the elevator to time we made an exit the with our souvenier (little too pricey picture).   Food : We both aren't much of foodie when it comes to experimenting and me being Vegetarian further limits the options. My boyfriend opted for chicken based entree while I had no choice but to go for only Vegetarian item i.e. Vegetarian Crepes. And my my was the food delicious!! yes it was 100%. I got too tempted when I saw the chicken and tasted for myself. It was pefect tender inside , cooked with precision and the flavors yumm.. My crepes were incredible. The sauce on my plate was to die for. I had mushroom spaetzel were amazing and recipe sounded pretty interesting. My boyfriend had potato on the side, very different and very yumm. After reading all the other reviews I took pistachio souffle. I found it little bitter, I'l ltry chocolate flavor next time. So, all the vegetarians outs there , don't worry !  View : I got lucky or may be it was my little note when I made reservations in OpenTable ,that we got the table with the view. The view was BREATHTAKING. Ambience could have been romantic but for the crowd making noise. But it was more of happy noise that saves a place from getting dull. I didn't mind it. I had enough romance going on in my small table enjoying the fountains.  Dress Code : They say that formal dress code is required but I saw men in shorts all the time. But seriusly , this place has all the makings of a special night. So, I'd suggesst make it a dressy unforgettable night !  Service : We had to wait for a while because we were about 45 mins late for our 8:15 reservation (blame my flat iron process). Service was quite nice except for the first waitress who served us wine who seemed reluctant to offer an extra napkin ! We found it wierd but it wasn't a big deal. Our server compensated for this faux pas for rest of the evening.  We even got our picture taken because it was just so perfect ! J'aime Eiffel Tower ! Highly recommended !",

Considering how busy it was, the wait was definitely understandable, and once we were seated, service was prompt. The staff was accommodating, the food was EXCELLENT, but overpriced (which is to be expected just about anywhere on the Strip). We got a window seat, so the view of the Strip was amazing, but it seemed like the seating was set up so the view would have been pretty great anywhere. Due to the crowd that was there, the restaurant was very noisy- almost comparable to a sports bar atmosphere, and it was pretty tough walking to and from our table without having to duck out of the way of wait staff and other customers a couple times. I would recommend this place for a date night or special occasion, but it would probably be best to avoid weekend nights. Be prepared to spend at least $100 per person.",

But it was my mothers first night in town, celebrating her birthday and surviving stage 3 cancer, so to say the least this was an extremely important dinner to celebrate. I chose to make this reservation weeks in advance for this occasion. My mother was so excited like a dream come True she's always wanted to go there, and I made it around the time the fountain show would go off at the Bellagio I had everything planned. The New York strip steaks were good, but for $65 a piece with no sides we asked for them medium well, and of course my mother the one we were celebrating got the bloodiest steak of them all. After 15 minutes of awaiting her return or anyone for that matter to check back, she asked for it to be cooked to temp slight pink center(medium well) so she had them put it back on the grill which to me I would've made a new steak but we said okay, we were already so happy to have my mom alive and healthy. But after the steak returned she did not ask how it was until it was time to collect all of our plates and pre bus the table. Which the \"waitstaff\" did already she just removed my husbands and fathers plates. The waiter kindly boxed my mothers food up and reminded the waitress it was my mothers birthday..... she then dropped the desert and said enjoy your desert. Not happy birthday! We're so glad your here! Nothing.... at this point I am severely disappointed, and the host at the kitchen elevator asked us how it was and we replied with totally not what we had been anticipating for years. But we paid, kindly thanked our waitstaff who assisted our table, and the lady at the door. For a $300+ bill I expected a personable, friendly service I would tip very well for at the end. I work in fine dining myself and I always give my guests an experience they would never forget and I'm left with a sub par feeling in my mouth remembering how the table next to us got treated so different by the same lady. We go out to nice restaurants all the time, but the lady we had tonight could most definitely improve her personality and maybe treat people with a little more respect for what their coming out to spend their hard earned money for. I am a local my parents are not not too thrilled this is where I chose to spend a good chunk of money. Thank you to the kind waitstaff, and hostesses, and for the wonderful window seat you had arranged for us all to sit at. Yadira I bet your a kind woman, but I did not get that impression, you gave us the impression that we were unimportant and I don't think that we got the same quality of service as your other guests did, I am sorry if you were having a bad night, but you most definitely ruined ours, sincerely someone who truly just wanted a friendly server to give us the friendly experience we always see and expect from high quality restaurants.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I came here during CES week (2nd week of January) on a Thursday or Friday night. I was looking for something that had a good atmosphere, and I've heard stories about the view at this place. I'm not sure if it was because it was CES week, but this place seemed a lot louder than I expected.   Venue: - Gorgeous views: you can see the Bellagio Fountain show go off while dining! - Very intimate: the window tables are quite small (half the size of a normal table), but it is a great excuse to get closer to the person you're dining with. - Pretty loud during CES week: it was similar to a casual sit-down restaurant, in terms of noise level - it was hard to have a good conversation without raising our voices or leaning in really close. We were seated at a window seat, so we had a perfect view of the strip. If you reserve ahead of time, I think you can request a window seat - I'd highly recommend it! It's beautiful, the only con for me was the amount of people coming to the window side to take pictures of the view. Overall, considering it was CES week, I give the venue a 4/5 - minus one star for the noise level.  Service: - Helpful service: the waiters were not only friendly, but very helpful! This was our first time trying French Food, and our waitress was very insightful and patient when we ordered - Perhaps new waiters?: Some of them might have been new, ie: while pouring water into my cup, a waiter splashed some over my  plate.  - Average speed: the speed our food came out was pretty average, not a huge long wait, but not super quickly either. I personally didn't notice it that much, simply because the view kept us entertained until the food arrived In terms of service, I'd rate this place 4/5. Although the waiters/waitresses were friendly and helpful, I wouldn't say that it's up to par for the cost of the meal (roughly $450). They were great in terms of how helpful and insightful they were, but trying to get the attention of our specific waitress later in the night was a little bit more difficult.   Food: I don't usually eat French food, so in terms of food - but I still thought it was pretty good. I ordered the filet mignon with foie gras on top - medium rare, which was delicious. In terms of food, I'd rate it 4/5. Although it was good, a few months later, the taste doesn't stick for me (personally). Therefore, I wouldn't rank it the best filet mignon I've ever had, but maybe that's just me. It's pretty big portions, however, which was surprising.   Overall, I thought the atmosphere outranked the food, for me. I feel that the food wasn't worth $400+ (2 main entrees, 2 appetizers, 1 dessert and 1 cocktail), but it was still good. Maybe I'm not a huge fan of French Food, but the combination of the gorgeous venue and the good food would make me come back. I figure that the price you're paying is equivalent to the premium views as well as the food - so overall, it was a great experience. I'd love to try it again next time I return to Vegas, just maybe on a less exciting week. Maybe then, the noise level wouldn't be as crazy, and I could actually have a good conversation with my boyfriend without raising our voices :]",

Would recommend the French onion soup. I've never had it prepared the way they did (was a bisque like soup), but the flavors were amazing",

    "text": "The service and views are amazing and worth the price of the meals, HOWEVER, if you're visiting from a city or town that has a decent culinary presence you probably won't be overly impressed.  We come from Wine Country with San Francisco less than an hour north.  San Diego and Los Angeles are a couple of places we like to frequent down South and up North, Portland and Seattle are our stomping grounds. The food was \"good for Las Vegas,\" but not outstanding when you're already accustomed to eating some of the best food in the world.    The hollandaise sauce on the green beans was so lemony that it overpowered the dish and made it too bitter to eat.  The au gratin potatoes were surprisingly bland.     There are only so many buffets and chains that you can eat at, so this was a nice reprieve but overall you could grab tickets to the elevator in the eiffel tower to take in the fantastic view and save yourself more than a few bucks.  Glad I went but most likely won't be back.",

The duck lacked flavor including the foie gras sauce and the rice tasted like it was cooked in a orange juice deduction in lieu of the claimed red wine. Next, it took almost an hour to get our food which was quite a disappointment. Beware they charge 18% gratuity for parties 5 or more.",

    "text": "A girlfriend and I came in for lunch on Saturday to take advantage of the prix fixe menu they offered in support of Las Vegas Restaurant Week.   I loved the seating/reservations coordinator downstairs. She checked my name in the computer, confirmed to the restaurant upstairs that I was in the building, and led us into the elevator. It was, at once, very posh and attentive, but cool and casual and welcoming. Definitely a good start.  The elevator opens up to the kitchen. A great touch; I love to see the kitchen and have a sense of what is going on with my food! Walk to the right and you enter into the bar area and see the hostess desk. You also see that there really isn't a bad seat in the place. It is tiered so as to offer, as much as possible, a view to every diner. Great idea. The decor is upscale and comfortable, simple and elegant without putting off the casual diner.  We were seated at an intimate two-person table on the window, facing the Bellagio and fountains. C'est parfait! Tres jolie! We loved the show against a somewhat dreary day in Las Vegas; the lights lit up the water and made the view (and by proxy the ambiance of the restaurant) that much more beautiful.  Service was spectacular. Everything was timed perfectly, from the amuse to the apps to the entrees to desserts. Wine service was expedient and attentive. Everything was explained well, if not a little too rehearsed; we heard the same spiel over and over, almost verbatim, to tables around us. Hint: change it up a bit, add some personality and personability to it! Still, friendly, capable, and humorous when appropriate, everyone was on their game.  Mmmmm, food. This *is* a restaurant, after all.  Drinks: We opted for wine by the glass, but they did have some yum-sounding signature cocktails... for about $18 a piece. Just not worth it to me... I can have three glasses of wine to your one cocktail and be happier for it. Others around us were loving their drinks, and I see value in that on occasion, but it was something we skipped... this time.  Amuse: a light but flavor-FULL mushroom flan with a small piece of mushroom on top. Savory goodness in less than a bite and one of the best fungi preparations I have had the pleasure of eating in a long time.  Apps: The foie gras (not on the LVRW menu, but ordered as an extra) was absolutely phenomenal. Served cold, it was a large, thick slice straight off the liver. Nothing formed or cubed or otherwise manipulated, it was marbled by veins and perfect. As if that's not amazing enough, it was wrapped in duck prosciutto. Yeah, drool-worthy.  The spinach and grueyere streudel was good. I hoped for more cheese, and I found the crust to be a bit too hard. That said, the flavors were solid and the spinach was fresh. Not a bad dish.  Entree: The flank steak had a great flavor and the cabernet jus was delicious. But there was something about how it was cut... almost against the grain? Sadly, it was also a little tough. We ordered them medium rare (I even added \"more on the rare side\") and they were closer, I think, to medium. Great flavors, but a little lost on execution.  Dessert: The peach tartin was fantastic. The pastry was light and crisp, the peaches were fresh, sweet and tender, and the basil ice cream with piece of crispy basil was a lovely, sweet and savory complement to the rest of the dish. Really, really done well.  I never felt rushed, the meal was very good and the prices were good. Aside from the prix fixe decision we made, the foie gras was only $20 (and compared to other places I have been lately, that's an amazing deal for what they offer. Definitely a fave!). With 2 glasses of wine each and all of the above, it was only $65 or so each before a tip. Very much worth the visit!  For next time... I see wine and foie gras and dessert at the bar. Casual yet still surrounded by the intimate elegance... and with a fabulous view.",

    "text": "So this review is a tad late, but still holds True I'm sure. The meal I had here was hands down one of the best, if not maybe even the best (or maybe I'm just saying this cause I can't afford to eat like this anymore since I moved to Europe) meal I've ever had. You can't get foie gras in California anymore, so of course I had to go with the legit tournedo rossini, which was pretty much, and I don't know if I've ever used this word in a review, probably not on Yelp at any rate, orgasmic. Yes, orgasmic people, I said it. It was melt in your mouth, and the textures and the flavors, me oh my. The foie gras was velvety and a great contrast to the tenderness of the filet. I don't think I even used a knife, didn't have to, I kind of just sliced through with my fork because it was like butter.  I also splurged, cause I like to go big on vacation and this was one of my last meals in the states, on the raw seafood platter. Yes it will break the bank, but again, so fresh and so clean. The lobster tail, crab legs, oysters and mussels, basically tasted like they had just been caught and brought to your table in under an hour, which we all know in the middle of the desert, wouldn't be possible, but my taste buds enjoyed thinking that it was.   Very pricey, but you know what they say in Vegas (well other than the thing about blackmail fodder staying there, cause with facebook I think they had to scrap that particular ad campaign) go big or go home!",

It was dinner time and we took an elevator up to the level of the restaurant and once you get out, there is a hostess waiting for you. You see the kitchen immediately and the hostess brings you to your table. We didn't have to wait at all.   Just as I hoped for, we got a table right by the window. Perfect view of the Bellagio and their water show. The only thing that ruined the view was cloudy sky. But I wasn't going to let that ruin my dinner.  The waiter was on top of everything and our glasses were never empty. I ordered the Baked Alaskan Halibut with vegetables and a side of potato gratin. I ordered the side because I had a feeling the portions would be small, but boy was I wrong. The fish was huge and the sauces so delicious.   For dessert we had the chocolate souffle, which I must say, is DELICIOUS! I still remember the sweet warm chocolate melting in my mouth. Ah, I'd definitely just return for dessert.  The only reason why I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is for one thing. When I took my first bite into my fish, there was a bone in it. And that's just not right. At least it was the only bone in my fish I found.",

LOL :)  This is my absolutely positively favorite place to have dinner in the United States! (Sorry, the restaurant in the real Paris are to die for and no comparison but let's focus on U.S.) Every time I fly to Vegas I just have to have dinner here. We definitely get the royal treatment. The view is stunning. If you make reservations around 530pm, hope that they seat you at the window and you can watch the sun setting while the water show is playing at The Bellagio and sipping on some wine. The wine is a bit pricey, but they have some reasonably priced bottles. (Look for Justin's Vineyard from Paso Robles-Cabernet Sauvignon) I think is was about 60 bucks (grt price for that particular restaurant) and the wine is excellent.  Try the Filet Mignon and the Asparagus in a carmelized butter sauce. Ok, I am getting hungry now.",

I totally thought we were at the wrong place when the elevator door opened up. We walked out of the elevator and the kitchen was right there. You could see all the hustlin and bustlin of the background scene. Totally different from what I expected but kinda cool at the same time. We got seated in a booth towards the back of the round restaurant but we still got this gorgeous view of the water front of Bellagio and the strip. The tables closest to the windowline were all two-seaters so no go for us.   The atmosphere is great but the food is only so-so. We had the pinky toe crab salad and seared scallop for appetizer. It was refreshing but nothing too special. My sea bass was significant overcooked...it was like chewing overcooked chicken. Since we were on a time schedule, I didn't bother to send my dish back. My friends' dishes weren't too impressive either, with the exception of the rack of lamb. The most memorable dish of the night was the souffle, which you should order at the beginning of your meal. It takes 40 minutes to make and they only make 20 for the entire room at a time. We had the Grand Manier and Caramel....omg....absolutely heavenly. I could eat that all night long. We also had the Banana Towel thingy (forgot what it was called) It wasn't too special either. I thought it would come warm but it was icy cold. It was just stacked banana slices swimming in white chocolate sauce. Again, nothing too special.   Overall, I enjoyed the meal because of the company and the view. I'm not too thrill about the food since I had much better in SF.",

Often I feel almost uncomfortable when going to nice restaurants because I get the feeling I have to show my best manners or talk in a relatively low voice.   Although we did not have a window seat, we still got an excellent view of the Bellagio water show. Not being a salad orderer, I was greatly surprised when my aunt ordered the warm lobster salad.  Wow is all I have to say about that, I have never \"enjoyed\" eating a salad, except this particular time.  The freshness of the vegetables shines, all salads should be prepared with this much dedication. I got the surf and turf and was was disappointed when I finished it.  The steak melted in my mouth, along with the flavor explosion that came from the crab.   I was a bit disappointed by the wine list, although larger than a Websters Dictionary, did not have a bottle under $100.  Because I was lucky enough not to pay, I was happy enjoying my beer instead.   Dessert was an experience in itself as everyone at the table sat silently while closing their eyes during every bite.  We ordered 4 different desserts and all were worth writing home to mom about. I would go back, but make sure you bring a credit card with a high limit.",

    "text": "I seriously wanted to avoid coming here, and I really should've after reading some not-so-consistent reviews.  But we were celebrating both of my parent's birthdays, and they were insistent on eating at Eiffel Tower.  (oh well, gotta make the parents happy)  Ok, well let's get started.  As you get off the elevator, you're immediately presented with the kitchen which is actually kind of cool.  The nice lady walks you to the hostess and so far I'm feeling hopeful.  We get seated immediately in a decent booth, but we really can't see much of a view.  I did specially request a nice view, but that didnt work out so well.  The atmosphere was just ok, and kind of on the loud side.  We started off with with the Roasted Foie Gras, White Almond Dusted Sea Scallops and Warm Lobster Salad for appetizers.  The foie gras was good but I've had much better, and the accompanying marinated grapes weren't the best match.  You really need something sweeter to go with the rich flavor of foie gras.  The scallops were cooked perfectly, and the lobster salad was probably my favorite.  At this point you're probably wondering - why 2 stars?  Well, read on my friend...  For entrees, we ordered Filet of Seabass, Venison Chop, Surf and Turf Beef Tenderloin, and the Bone-in Ribeye.  The seabass was cooked just right but the seasoning was non-existent.  The Venison was cooked perfectly as well and we were pretty pleased with that dish.  The Surf & Turf Beef Tenderloin was quite a disappointment.  The crab meat was like a dried out crab cake, and although the tenderloin was cooked perfectly, it had no flavor at all.  It didn't even have a nice char, which definitely makes a good steak.  The ribeye was probably the best entree of them all.  Nice and juicy and actually seasoned well too.  We also had a side order of scalloped potatoes which was a total waste of money.  At this point the food has been just OK and if you look at the prices, it's really not worth it at all.  But I guess it is Vegas and almost all of the high end restaurants are at least $40 per entree (easy).  Am I just spoiled with the quality and service of San Francisco restaurants?  I haven't yet mentioned anything about service yet, but it was just ok at this point.  Nothing like the Dining Room at the Ritz in SF, and our server seemed way too busy with another table that he really didn't come to check up on us at all.  The rest of the staff was fairly attentive, but I would expect way better service for a restaurant like this.   Ah yes, dessert.  My absolute favorite course of any meal.  I'm hoping that my opinion of the restaurant will change with dessert.  Of course like everyone else, we did get suckered into ordering a souffle at the beginning of the meal, so that was already on its way.  So we wait, and wait, and still no dessert menu.  Someone finally brings us new place settings, but still no dessert menu.  Do they not have a dessert menu?  We can't even find our server because he obviously has way too many tables.  Someone finally brings our souffle, and at that point we asked him for dessert menus.  He says he'll bring them right away....yeah right.  The souffle was delicious I must say, and they were kind enough to bring out complimentary desserts to wish my parents a happy birthday.  But where's my dessert menu??! ! At some point I just gave up because I was so annoyed.  Now you know why I give Eiffel Tower Restaurant only 2 stars.  By the end of the meal, I am annoyed that we have a huge bill to pay and we got a less than satisfactory fine dining experience.  I'm really wishing that I had just made reservations at Picasso in the Bellagio or at Guy Savoy instead.  I could've even just gone back to Delmonico's, Michael Mina, Bouchon, Fleur de Lys, all where I've had way better experiences than this.    In conclusion... Food=3 stars Ambiance=3 stars Service = 1 star (pretty much non-existant) Dessert=1 star (for not ever bringing me a dessert menu) Which averages out to 2 stars.",

I highly recommend the chicken here, it's the cheapest entre on the menu, and trust me you will not be disappointed. I personally am addicted to the Beef Wellington, but please...and I stress that you have to have the Pistachio souffle (it's a must). The service is the best I've ever seen, your glass of water is never empty and that's no lie! They really treat you like royalty here, and the view of the Bellaggio Water Show tops it off.",

They seated us right in front of the water show (which I saw like 7 times without the music). The food was good but the dessert was fantastic. We got a tower of thinly sliced bananas and vanilla  chocolate shaped in a tower. The other desserts looked good also but we were too full from the main course.  If your looking for  romantic restaurant to take a love one, this is definitely the spot.",

    "text": "The girls and I decided to treat ourselves to a nice dinner.  Only problem - we didn't have reservations anywhere and it was 11 AM Saturday morning.  No worries, we whipped out an iPhone, went on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fopentable.com&s=897c359bd752b4f5407d5ea86453c82be2d1913c8d0b51b18d81fc58f52a6497\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">opentable.com</a>, and scored a reservation for 7:30 PM.  Of course, being Vegas, we showed up 45 minutes late to dinner.  Unlike Tao, they didn't give away our table and they didn't scold us.  I like the Eiffel Tower Restaurant already!  Did I mention we all wore jeans to dinner?  Score!  Yes, this is a very romantic restaurant; yes, there is a beautiful view.  Service was impeccable, decor very lovely, yada yada.   Really though, it was all about the food.  We started off with cocktails - I recommend the Autumn in Paris (it's like a pear slushee, with booze).  For an appetizer I had the sea scallops (Sauteed Sea Scallops, Cauliflower Mousseline,Riesling Jus).  Best.  Scallops.  Ever.  I don't even like cauliflower!  For my entree, I opted to try the sea bass (though next time, I'm all about the venison).   The sea bass was perfectly cooked, and served with potatoes and bacon (helllooooo!!!  How awesome is that??).  But the best part of the meal was dessert.  My friends and I are all greedy beyotches, so we each ordered our own souffle:  chocolate, pistachio, and banana.  Each was amazing, but the banana took the cake for me.  Next time I'm in Vegas, I'm going to order all 3 just for myself.     Tab:  2 cocktails, one appetizer, one entree, one souffle = $119 (not including tip).",

    "text": "Rose petals were scattered on our table and a long stem rose was left just for me. Top that with an awesome view of the water show, great service, and delicious French cuisine. Need I say more?  The lights were dim and the ambience was very romantic. Our server, Maria was very helpful in making suggestions and answering some questions we had about the menu. After taking our order, we were presented with diff types of bread we could choose from to start out with. I got the multigrain which was hard, and the bf got the baguette, which was alright. Here's what we ended up having after the bread: 1. Tasting plate(asparagus w/goat cheese, duck pate w/pork, and some kind of tomato bisque w/shrimp)- asparagus and cheese was deelish, bisque was ok, pate was \"real good\" according to my bf. 2 . Appetizers( thinly sliced salmon w/toast and a side of capers,onions, and creme fresh and escargot w/bacon and red wine reduction)- salmon was real good but probably would've gone better with a diff type of toasted bread rather than reg bread. We both couldn't get ourselves to finish the escargot. I don't know if it was the red wine reduction or what, but it tasted like liver and blood. 3. Entrees- The bf got the surf and turf with a side of potato gratin and I got the Mediterranean sea bass and a side of creamed spinach and mushroom. According to the bf the steak was \"perfectly seasoned(peppercorn) and juicy\" while the lobster was just tasty. The potato gratin was also good and very light. My fish was real good BUT it was sitting on top of  bread crumb and some kind of sauce which was very sour. I ended up eating the fish with the spinach and mushroom which turned out real good, but opted out of the bread crumb and that sour sauce. 4. Dessert- Ofcourse we had the souffle, which was ok for me but orgasmic to the bf. Then they brought out sorbet samples. Flavors were: mango, strawberry, chocolate, and sour cream(the best). Second best was chocolate, then mango, then strawberry.We then had chocolate mousse and cappuccino, both were awesome.  Dinner then ended with a 263 dollar check, but was very much worth it. It was just a great anniversary dinner and we couldn't be any happier. We already have plans coming back on our decade anniversary next year!  What a great night we had here! From the food to the views, everything was amazing!",

We were stopped in the Paris Hotel casino floor near the base of the Eiffel Tower Restaurant by one of the greeters. She was so kind to give us a look at the menu and give us details as to what to expect. She took us on a tour of the restaurant. The server greeted us as we entered and left the lobby greeter, I must say it was the smoothest transition and hand off ever. The server seated us by the beautiful window view. I don't know how she knew but she took our pictures for our anniversary. I will say, the Bellagio Hotel is the biggest view and attraction for people eating in the Tower, however, the water fountain show doesn't play M-F until after 3pm so don't be shocked there's no water show but it is still a beautiful view.    She was more than gracious to explain to us the menu and selections. The food was Deliciono. The servers were all so prompt, professionals and informative while still polite. The entire experience was awesome. Great place to eat at if you want fine dinning and stellar service. The prices are seasonable and affordable.    I had a Salmon seared dish. Perfect!! My husband enjoyed a medium rare steak, Perfect!! A must eat location!!!!!!!!",

Yeah, we spent more than we planned for lunch thanks to a pricey but tasty cocktail and wine menu, but we also got more thanks to nice views, formal service and above-average fare.  This place was loaded with French tourists when we were there, which is something that's both heartening and depressing. On the one hand it shows that the food must be reasonably good and authentic, but on the other it makes you wonder if the French are the least adventurous diners in the world. You fly thousands of miles for vacation to sit in a replica of a famous landmark from your home country and eat food you could get on any city block in France? Bold move, Jacques! As Midwesterners, however, we thoroughly enjoyed the upscale French bistro food and relaxing setting for lunch. Seafood options were particularly good, as were the baked goods.",

No reservations, but pouf! A dress code. And, while not inexpensively dressed by any standards, my friend was showing an alarming amount of shin and toe cleavage. Luckily, the reservation manager was well-prepared and had tuxedo pants loaners stashed under his table, plus a large cache of black socks.  So, my pal pulled on the pants over his shorts, and put socks on with his, O-MI-GOD, sandals. Quelle horreur!! La scandale!!  Anyhoo, we were seated right away, up against the window overlooking the Paris balloon and the Bellagio waters. With the setting sun in our eyes, we had a spectacular view.  The service from our waiter, Oliver, was 90% fabulous. He went MIA toward the end, but had been flawless until that time.  But, that brings us to the food. The appetizers and sides were delicious. The main courses, not so much. A bit dry and drab. So, my recommendation would be to do a series of appetizers and side dishes (the entrees are a la carte, naturellement), and save room for dessert!",

The restaurant is at the Paris hotel and offers a panoramic view of all the neighboring hotels and the strip, such as Planet Hollywood, Cosmopolitan, Bellagio, Bally's, etc.    We called to make dinner reservations and found out that they could only guarantee window seating for 5:00 and 5:15 reservations during Fall. Window seating after those times was based on availability. (Note: Their reservations require a credit card.)  Taking our chances, we made reservations for 5:45 p.m. for an anniversary dinner celebration.  We were very pleasantly surprised when we were led to one of the coveted window tables directly facing Bellagio after we arrived for dinner.  We enjoyed a leisurely dinner - first admiring the beautiful sunset behind the Bellagio hotel and then watching at least five different water fountain shows at Bellagio after the sky darkened.  I have never watched the water show from up above and it was the most amazing sight.    The food was magnificent!  We had the beef wellington, the vegetarian crepe, a side of the potato croquettes and enjoyed the pistachio souffle for dessert.  The restaurant also gave us a complimentary chocolate mousse.  It was perfect.",

Overall, I was very impressed with the Eiffel Tower restaurant.  I expected to find very over-priced menus with food unworthy of the hype.  I am happy to say that this is not the case.

    "text": "One of my top ten restaurant experiences of all time.  Really spectacular service.  Outstanding food.  An amazing view.  Expensive (although not the most expensive meal I've ever eaten) and worth every damn penny.    Your experience starts off on the casino floor where you take a special elevator up to the restaurant.  The doors open and you are greeted by an adorable majordomo standing in front of the gleaming glass and chrome kitchen which is a positive beehive of activity. You round the corner into a cozy dark reception area with seating and a small bar area.  The couple next to us was eating at the bar so I supposed if you are too spontaneous to make a reservation you can still enjoy the restaurant.  Our table was ready after about 10 minutes (we had a drink at the bar, which seems to be stocked with at least one bottle of every liqueur known to man, meticulously organized and labeled)  We had a window table with a great view of the fountains and strip.  Service was flawless.   They select and train staff very well.  And the food....  Starters Me:   Cold Foie Gras Boyfriend:  Warm Foie Gras Set the standard for the dinner to come.  Phenomenal.    Main Me:  Venison Chop Boyfriend:  Rack of Lamb Side Dish:  Brussels Sprouts As tender and amazing as the meat was on my chop, the star of the plate was the little oatmeal cake it was served with.  For many restaurants the starch is kind of an afterthought (\"Umm, yeah let's throw some potatoes on here to take up space\").  I am still thinking about that sublime little round of deliciousness a month later.    To my absolute surprise we learned from the it is a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant from the lovely manager who visited our table and chatted with it.  I wholeheartedly recommend this as a great special event restaurant.    And please fellow Yelpers, DRESS APPROPRIATELY.  Yes, it is Vegas where you can wear a tee shirt and jeans 99% of the time, but this is the 1% of the time you shouldn't.  I know you'll argue that you are paying good money so why should you dress up for others but go ahead and wear those heels and dress shoes.  Enjoy it.  Savor the fanciness.   It is a special meal, so relax and enjoy it for what it is.  You deserve it, right?",

    "text": "BEST customer service in the world! So it's Valentine's Day, traffic is terrible and I have 8:15 reservations here.  After fighting traffic and waiting in a loooong valet line, we go up to the restaurant and realized it wasalmost 9 o'clock.  Would you believe it?  On one of the busiest nights, they still held our reservations and it only takes them 15 minutes to get our table ready.  After being seated, our waiter serves us our choices on their V-day menu.  Everything tasted great, the second we finished something they took our plate, the restaurant was pretty, the view of the fountain was nice, and my wine glass never was empty until the end.  I already was thinking in my head to give it four stars (only because I thought it was just a bit over priced).  However, I ended up giving them five because of this...  My waiter came back saying what NO ONE ever wants to hear, \"I'm so sorry, but your card was declined\".  The room went black and I died (at least that's what I wanted to happen in that moment).  Immediately, I called my bank.  After having the worst experience on the phone with my bank again (review of Chase customer service coming soon, and it won't b,pretty) and not having any way to pay, I expected the worst.  With no questions asked, the waiter and the manager informed me in the kindest manner that they'll just do a copy of the card and my ID and to not worry whatsoever, to come back tomorrow was just fine and don't let this ruin my Valentine's Day.  Eiffel Tower, I loved your decor, food presentation as well as taste, the live singer and nice views.  But what I loved most was the superb customer service and understanding.  Thank you for not making me feel like such a cheap skate.  Will you always be my Valentine?",

The kale salad had just the right amount of dressing and was delicious. However the onion soup had a hair in it and I pointed it out to the waiter as soon as he dropped it off he apoligized and brought me another soup which was ok but hard to enjoy after there was a hair... For our second course I had the flank steak which was just ok and my mother had the salmon which she really enjoyed. We both loved our desserts. We both had a few cocktails and they were all very good.   all the choices on the strip I dont think I will come back due to having a hair in my soup and not having anything taken off the final bill....  I worked in the restaurant industry and if there is a hair in your food a manager comes to the table!",

The food was excellent - I got the Beef Wellington with ratatouille.  The souffles were PERFECT! OMG the souffles were so freaking yummy I was scraping the bottom of the dishes. You must get it! I had Gran Marnier and pistachio. I'm drooling.  Make reservations. Dress up. A lot of the men were with suit jackets and women in cocktail dresses.",

Found out that we could get guaranteed night time view of the fountain if reservations were made for 5 pm or 5: 15 pm, for a maximum of two people.  We were not disappointed - saw 3 fountain shows (every 1/2 hour).  We had a not so friendly waiter (thus, the 4 stars) and a slight problem with luke warm soup - but management quickly stepped in to rectify to our satisfaction with the soup.  Would have given 5 stars but the waiter was stiff and unfriendly and a tad edgy....  Food was pretty good, and the dessert was DELICIOUS!",

    "text": "thanks boyfriend for an amazing early valentine's day dinner!  out of all the award winning restaurants and famous chefs here on the las vegas trip, i choose to dine at the eiffel tower restaurant because the view looked beautiful from pictures i've seen and for now, this will be the closet thing i'll get to the real eiffel tower in paris.  the eiffel tower restaurant has its own private elevator that takes you up 11 stories. i had requested a window seat when i made my reservations through opentable and fortunately enough, we got window seats directly facing the bellagio fountains  while we waited for our table to be ready, the boyfriend and i each started off with a cocktail. i dont remember the names, but i know the one i got was the eiffel tower's signature drink - a sangria type drink with a mixture of berries and bubbly like champagne. the other one was a type of pear infused drink.  for appetizers, the two of us shared the grand seafood platter which could have been an entree by itself. it is a little pricey ($98) but i think its well worth it. we got a whole lobster split in half, a giant king crab leg with a good amount of meat in it, several oysters and clams, and jumbo shrimp with three different cocktail sauces. i loved the crab, oysters, and shrimp  for my entree i got the roasted rack of lamb with tarragon jus and glazed turnips. the lamb was extremely tender and really flavorful with the sauce. i tried a little bit of the boyfriend's cured duck. we asked what it meant by cured and we were told that it was soaked in coffee the night before. coffee duck sounded a little strange but you cant really taste the coffee and the duck was pretty tender as well. it's not the usual chinese bbq duck im used to. the duck tasted more like some sort of red meat, but still good nonetheless.  for dessert i went with majority of people's suggestion on yelp and ordered the chocolate souffle. it was delicious! im not a big fan of chocolate but i loved this dessert! the warm chocolate sauce poured into the soft yet slighty crunchy souffle. a must try! and remember to put in the order when you first order your other things because it takes awhile to make.  price wise, it was on the more expensive side, but it is las vegas. the service here was excellent, the view of the fountains were beautiful, the portions weren't disappointing for a fine dinning restaurant, and i was very happy with everything we got. the only thing i regret not doing is riding up the eiffel tower after dinner. oh well, next time! i would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to treat themselves and/or other people to a great dining experience",

Both times we were seated by the windows and the view was awesome at evening/night time. The service was good. It is kind of tight squeeze in there but the food and view make up for that.

Let's start with the view...amazing, we lucked out and got a window table with a perfect view of the Bellagio fountains and a nice sightline up and down the strip, I can only imagine the views to be even more breathtaking at night. As a whole the food was just slightly above average (but still above average and I have higher expectations than most) but there was a few hints of awesomeness tossed in. They bring out a bread basket and one of the little flatbread things in the basket was simply amazing, we sent the waiter back for thirds LOL and the potatoes crouqet were delish and I don't even normally like potatoes. Service was great as well.. Summary, you can definetly find a better meal in Vegas but probably not a better view/meal combo.

    "text": "I would give this place 5 stars if it weren't for our snooty server. Eiffel Tower is the perfect special occasion restaurant for a romantic evening with your S.O., girls night, bach party, etc. I came here with my best gfs for a bachelorette dinner and enjoyed it for the most part.  My only gripe about the restaurant was our pretentious server. As we were seated we were only given the drink menu. Which is completely fine, but we were also hungry and didn't have time to take a 3 hour dinner as we had to book it to Omnia to see Afrojak! So we asked for the food menu and she kept making us feel bad bc not everyone wanted to order $20 cocktail when we could drink for free at the club!   There is a bread guy that goes around to all the tables. Wheat and multi grain is my favorite. I did try to lay off the carbs on this trip, but the bread here I just couldn't resist! Also, their butter is some bougey butter bc it was good AF!  Lobster, steak, cod and beef wellington were all very well executed to our liking.  If you have time for dessert, definitely get the Pistachio souffle. Trust me you won't regret it! Just FYI - let your server know in advance bc it takes ~20min to prepare.  Put in a request with the hostess to be seated in front of the Bellagio fountains. If you go for dinner around 8pm, you'll get a perfect view of the fountain show with your dinner.  Take into consideration, this place is not cheap. We spent at least ~$100/person.  The restaurant is located far from the self parking deck (Free parking at Paris btw).",

Remember you eat with your eyes FIRST!!!!!!     Our cocktails all superb, mine a whiskey Sour and my girlfriend ordered a speciality gin cocktail with a rose petal that they raved about the other drink were more typical martinis & scotch & water, no complaints anywhere.      My starter was a Alaskan King  crab & Avocado layered upon layer and a VERY generous portion too! They do not skimp at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant ~    My main was the Queen Steak, cooked perfectly and melted like butter in my mouth  ~    I did order the chocolate souffle for dessert  and well worth the antisapation.       This is a special occasion restaurant for sure as the view in unbelievable, the service impeccable!!!! Our maitre 'd was Constantin~ and set the pace for our dinner as we did have Show tix later, offered a quicker route how to walk there all without being stuffy! I will request his station upon our next visit, Just perfection in his over 6ft frame a True professional~",

We always make reservations especially on weekends since it does get busy here! We are always seated right away. I love the ambience of this place because of the old school fine dining seating and at night they leave it dim so that your attention is more focused on the beautiful view outside! Every time we've been seated we always got the window in front of the Bellagio Fountain View. It is absolutely amazing to see the water show from a higher view.   As for the food, we ordered the steak tartare and foie gras as our appetizers. The steak tartare was buttery and the garlic with aoli gave it such a yummy umami flavor. The foie gras was smooth and had a clean salty taste which paired very well with the sweet fig compote.  For our main course we ordered the Lobster with spinach florentine, the veal, and lamb chop dish. All were cooked perfectly and had distinct/tasty flavors. I love that the menu is simple yet still has a lot of options for appetizers, main courses, and sides!   We also ordered the souffles for dessert! If you are a dessert person and love something perfectly sweet, light, and a bit creamy; their souffle is perfect for you! I recommended to anyone that decides to dine here to ORDER THEIR SOUFFLE!!  My mom ordered the orange flavor, I got Nutella, and my gf ordered chocolate. They had the right amount of each flavor, they were puffed out perfectly with a thin crust on top, and pairs with a creamy melted sauce to pour into the middle of it.   Overall, this restaurant has the perfect ambience for an intimate dining experience with a beautiful view of the Bellagio Fountain! Their food definitely lives up to French Standard and service was spot on. There was always someone who checked up on us, refilled out waters, and were very friendly. We will probably be back for our 4th time haha",

The view is to die for, with a perfect view of the Bellagio's fountain show, and the bustling strip below. The cuisine is elegant, and the staff are fantastique in their description of each dish. We enjoyed a variety of starters, entrees, and desserts, those that stood out were the olive oil mashed potatoes, and the creamed spinach and mushrooms, for starters. For entrees, you can't miss the Muscovy duck breast, tender, mouthwatering...heaven. For dessert, the decadent classic chocolate souffle is light, fluffy, creamy, and sinfully rich. When in Vegas, the Eiffel Tower restaurant is a must.",

No pina colada due to no blender, so I ordered another tropical drink which was tasty.  We were given a window seat and it was a fabulous view of the Strip, loved the floor to ceiling windows!  The servers were very attentive and our waiter was very elegant looking with a European accent.  I had beef wellington which was nice and for dessert the chocolate souffle which was just ok. The green beans were buttery and delicious.  The view was the best part of this experience, so glad we got a window seat.  Even got to see the Bellagio dancing fountains!",

Every single meal was just hmmm tasteless or bad   This is not my personal opinion only all of our friends and other guests complained   Now the way they serve the meals was really unheard off non stop misplaced the right dish , many times they deliver out meal then apologized and took it to different table .  But pretty much the worse experience was checking in desk with poor hard working girls that was placed in front of loud music band . People pushing on each other backs and can't hear nothing .  I would like to send warm regards to the management that setup this event and I pray for you poor people that god will bless you soon with more brains then money since at this point you have it seriously backwards   Literally we have recommended to all friends to never go there",

Only complaint which isn't really a complaint was that the waiter asked if we were celebrating anything we said my birthday. He was like oh great! And that was the end of it, tables next to us also celebrating birthdays and anniversary's got a lot more enthusiasm and a cute dessert from the chief. We didn't get any of that but we were so stuffed by the time we were done it didn't really matter, just a aww factor.",

Frankie and doc had salmon and bear had the chicken which he described as the best he's had. For desert we had a raspberry souffle and the special apple desert.

Usually I cook dinner for me and my GF every night that I'm not working, but sometimes we like to eat out to enjoy the LV Chefs and support them. Honestly I know it's french food and the plates are small but when you offer small plates you better make sure every bite makes your heart skip a beat. The food here is like a 6/10 and for us paying $400 for the meal the food is a 2/10. Probably one of the worst Beef Wellingtons I've ever tried. The lobster salad was very bland too. Deft not worth $400 for a meal. Probably won't come back unless forced to.",

But I definitely recommended the duck and put in an order for the souffle. Our waiter told us prior to dinner being served if we wanted a souffle we would need to put the order in prior Bc it can take 30 to 40 mins to prepare. And boy oh boy we're we glad to do so. The souffle was so light and airy, I got passion fruit and it was the perfect tart. Can not wait to return to Vegas to go back!",

The service was great, the server spoke French, English, and German (and God knows what else) so I spoke to her in German, just to match the cost of the food.  My partner and I ordered the tasting menu with the wine paring. Both were almost flawless until the main meat course, which sucked my donkey's ass (some chef experiments aren't meant to be charged for).   We began with an amuse bush of three small items including lobster, sausage, and cured vegies. Our first course was a raw scallop appitizer. This was my favorite course of the evening. After that we had a delicious seared fish followed by the main meat couse which was a tenderloin of venison with a spice rub. The venison was totally overpowered by the rub, which tasted so strong it was almost like powdered pine needles (I am thinking, pepper, star anise, cloves, allspice, and maybe thyme). We packed that in a box to eat later, which I tried to do but gagged every time until I threw it away.  The desert course was lovely, I recall it being a chocolate mouse which my partner gobbled up as her favorite course of the night.  The wine pairing flowed nicely and in fact so nicely that I gave my partner my last three glasses, and she got sexily buzzed.  The best thing about the evening besides the service was the view. We sat sat right at the window in the middle of the fake Eiffel Tower, overlooking the Bellagio wather show, which we got to see multiple times.   It was a lovely dinner (except for the venision which was like a poop in the punchbowl) and then proceeded to our hotel room for some after-the-culinary-orgy exercise.  A very nice night - at the cost of $450 for two of us.",

My friend and I were staying at Paris and made reservations to eat dinner here because we thought it would be fun and that we would have a nice time.  I figured the food would be ok but probably not great, just overpriced due to the gimmickyness of everything.  So we got all dressed up and took the fun elevator ride up the tower to the restaurant.   We took a peek at the cool open kitchen and then took a seat at the bar since our table wasn't ready.  The drinks, like everything else were overpriced but really delicious and well made.  After a few sips our table was ready and we were seated right in the front by the window.  The views are totally worth the expensive food.  You can see the strip lights, watch all the happenings from above and see the fountain show across the street.  The service was really good and our waiter stayed on top of everything the entire time.  The beef wellington I had was amazing!!!  I love, love, loved it and I am not really much of a beef eater.  My friend and I also shared a pistachio souffle and it was also delicious.  Made correctly, one of the best souffles I have had in a while.  If you are looking for a romantic dinner spot, or just a nice place with a great view and good food this is a good choice.",

The lobster was not actually a whole baked lobster - it was pieces of lobster mixed with mostly spinach and cream. It was salty and underwhelming. When asked about the preparation method, we were told it was \"French with a twist\" which apparently means very little lobster with lots of cream and salt. The lamb chops were okay, and not particularly fresh. The beef wellington had a very thin almost non-existent crust, and the cut of steak was chewy. Salads were the best part of the meal. If you're looking for a good view of the fountains, there are much better food options at the Bellagio.",

Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and gave honest opinions about the dishes that we had questions about. Love the fact that I wasn't rushed to do anything. That's from looking over the menu to paying for the bill. The Sommelier was very knowledgeable and a great help. Although we ended up going with a cocktail she was truly a help.   We had Tartar Salmon, followed by Creamy Onion Soup,  then for our main course my wife had \"the Queen\" (filet mignon), while I had the neapolitan of rabbit. For sides dishes we shard a chessey potato dish and a mushroom spinach dish. Then finished the night off with a Grand Marnier Souffle. And because it was our Anniversary they gave us a chocolate mousse desert, with a special writing in chocolate drizzle.   I would definitely recommend this place to a friend.",

    "text": "This was planned as the Highlight of a Romantic Vegas Getaway... Turned out to be the one blemish on an otherwise fantastic Weekend.  Things that might be interesting to a Yelper.  1.  They require a CC at booking.  There is a Dress Code.  Don't show or cancel within adequate time and they charge your card.  Fair Enough.  2.  The View-  They have a view of the Fountains but without the music from the Fountains the effect is not as high as you might expect.  Plenty of their tables lack a fountain view.  Ours was overlooking a Hot Tub at the Paris where two individuals were engaging in the kind of PDA that was rather unfortunate for all involved.  3.  The Staff-  Uppity was brought to a new level here.  Our Waiter could have been the Maitre D from Ferris Bueller's Day Off.   4.  Problem 1-  The Order-  I ordered the Lobster.  We both had drinks as we sat and we were certainly having dessert and likely another drink (or two).  This was not going to be a small bill.  (You don't book this restaurant looking for a cheap date people).  My Wife ordered the Asparagus Soup and Crab Cake as her entree.  It was listed as an appetizer.  Response-  You MUST order an entree per seat in our restaurant Madame.  In retrospect... This was a WALK situation if I have ever experienced one.  Just a get up.  So Sorry.  Walk.  It was all downhill from here.  Wife was taken aback-  And pivoted into a $32 Vegetarian entree.  I think that was maybe a $8 jump in price? Offended for essentially being called cheap.  Mood changed.  Suddenly on the defensive for no reason.  Did not want the Vegetarian Dish.  Wanted the Asparagus Soup and Crab Cake.  Solution on the odd chance management reads this and cares=  Propose to Serve the Appetizer as an Entree.  So Simple.  Just throw an additional Crab Cake on there and bump the cost up to that of an entree.  Or-  Simply advise that you must charge a minimum of the lowest entree.  Anything.  But \"You must order an entree\" forces a patron into a dish they never desired.  Success never follows here.  5.  Problem 2-  The Lobster was Cold.  Ice Cold.  No idea how you botch that.  Seafood in the middle of the desert is not to be trifled with.  This was the first meal I have ever sent back to the Kitchen in my life.  The Chef came out to apologize... Agreed that it was ice cold and seemed baffled as to how that happened.  Replaced or Reheated (Wasn't really sure) and we waited while my wife stared at her disappointing entree selection.   End of day they brought us a complementary dessert as a \"So Sorry\" for botching the Lobster.  At that point for me I just wanted out of the restaurant.  With all of the spectacular options throughout Las Vegas-  Its a shame this one skates by solely on location.",

You must Reserve and try to get a table overlooking the fountains... Very nice. The bar area is also quite nice and the entrance once you get off the elevator is spectacular... One of those movie kitchens.... Service is above average and the somelier Jennifer was very nice, she tried to pick a wine that suites our budget and did fine. Wine Is extremely overpriced, so be prepared for that! Remeber to bring a collar shirt, they do have a dress code. Now the food, this is where this place stands out period! The steak tartare is above average with hints of dill that made it unique... Well balanced, good texture and elegant. The main course was way above average... Sinply reaching those levels of perfection... The chef did just what needed to be done, cooked to perfection and giving the plate the correct balance even though I would have substituted the \"fried brioche\" under the steak ( that was there for texture and crunchy balance) and done something different..... The meat, well, see the pictures... Tender, flavourfull, thick, juicy and the foie gras on top, well I'm just getting the texture in my mouth again and is making me drule... Don't forget to ask for the souffle ahead of time as it will take time to prepare... Again, try thinking outside of the usual chocolate and do yourself a favor... Grand marnier... Simply soectacular... Perfect consistency, temperature, size, texture.....  Loved this place, my 1 star off, sinply absurd procing for the wine... They should let people have several wines that could be recommended by the somm at decent prices... As for the chefs, Congrats!",

There's no wait at all around 12pm during Valentine's/President's weekend and been seated at the window seat right away..wondering why?? hmmm....Our waiter is very friendly, service is GOOD and the view is GREAT  We ordered the following plus 2 drinks 1) Cold Foie Gras Torchon      It was okay, nothing special 2) Lamb burger      It looks very delicious when the waitress bring out the dish, but the bun is very soggy due to all the sauces and juices 3) Beef tartare -- this is where it went wrong      When I first look at it, my first impression is.....the color of the raw meat looks a little funny. But I ate it anyways since the raw beef was over powered by all the spices they put in it, I couldn't really tell if the meat is bad at this point and I don't like wasting food. I started having upset stomach after we left the place. I have very strong stomach so if I get sick, that means the food is reallllly not good   Anyways, the bill come out to be $100 before tips. The food quality does not match their price point. For great view I would still go back to Mon Ami Gabi, for great food, there are alot more restaurants to choose from at the same price point or even pricier I would still think it's worth paying than coming here.",

Made reservation at 8, changed to 9:30, still requested a window seat with Bellagio fountain and strip views, host girl was so nice, gave us a window seat before 9:30, great job! I had a specialty cocktail at the bar, red velvet, it was so yummy! Sweet but strong, liked it a lot.   I can't even describe how amazing the views were.... I had photos of that, please check them out! Our waiter greeted us very friendly, gave us wine list first, expensive bottles of wine, red, white, sparkling, I didn't see one bottle less than $70, we ordered bottle of champagne around $100, it was so good! We took time to look through the menu while sipping on our champagne.   Their complimentary bread was a big tray, server carry it around for dining people to choose what kind of bread we want, they gave us a creamy soup as dipping sauce,  butter too. I didn't like the cold bread and soup, but it was a great dipping sauce, bread tasted so delicious with it.  Our amazing food: Trio of American Caviar, Golden Whitefish, American Sturgeon, Salmon Roe, 28 grams each, with Creme Fraiche, Chives, Blinis and Toast: they were heavenly delicious! Beautiful presentation! We enjoyed every single bit of it very much  Cream of mushrooms soup, wild rice galette, crispy shallots: so delicious, soup was very flavorful  Maine lobster salad, roasted butter squash, wilted kale, old cider vinaigrette: the kale was so yummy! The lobster was very tender and flavorful, loved loved it!   Fricasse of escargot, sweetbreads, fennel, farm raised poached egg, Pinot noir jus: the escargot was so tender, but not very flavorful, the poached egg was perfect, I still loved it cause I wanted something light as entree for that night.   Char broiled filet Mignon, red wine sauce: hubby asked for extra red wine sauce, he said the filet was one of the best he has ever had for a very very long time! He absolutely loved the red wine sauce!  Gratinee creamed spinach and mushroom: too creamy to our liking, but still yummy  We didn't order desert, the portions were really big for French cuisine! But the restaurant gave us chocolate mousse for our anniversary! They even put chocolate \"happy anniversary\" on the plate.... Aww... It was just too sweet and beautiful!   I was so happy for our memorable anniversary dinner, with beautiful views from our seat, over the top service, tasty champagne, delicious food, what more could I ask?.... It was just amazing! $350 dinner was very well worth it....  A perfect restaurant for romantic dinner date or special occasions!",

The view is great, and the ambiance is kinda fancy but not over the top. We really enjoyed the complimentary bread and butter, and they come around offering more bread which is hard to say no to.  I've enjoyed a brunch menu which was $39, and came with a shrimp appetizer (2 pieces), salmon omelette (really good), and a yummy strawberry champagne ice cream that was a pretty decent size.  They also sometimes give complimentary candies or \"amuse bouche\" which i never heard of before until one time i went lol... like a little tiny appetizer before a meal.  I would recommend the BLT sandwich.  I don't know that I would order anything too fancy or expensive, but to order a fun meal under $20 (like the BLT, or soup and salad),  I think the view is worth it.  The coffee is good but it's like $8!  So you can get a decent meal for not too expensive as long as you don't over order....   I've never had a problem with the service, they've always been friendly and attentive.",

The restaurant is up towards the building, we had to take the elevator by the receptionist. The bathrooms had employees serving us with paper towels, offering perfumes and waiting for tips. The service was really good and friendly.   We had the Beef Wellington and roasted Chicken and Potato Gratin. They were all good. But I didn't like the potato Croquette. The desert souffle was good also. Prepare to have a fat bill even for a couple. I spent more than $300. Half a dozen roses cost $30 and a small photo cost $25. I would still comeback coz I liked the food.",

Definitely get the chickpea frites side-amazing! One of the best meals I've had in my life.",

The main dishes were large portions of the snapper, salmon,  and pork chop.  The potatoes au gratin were a hit at the table.  Excellent service and  good food in a nice upscale atmosphere.  If not a bit overpriced it would be five stars",

As for the entree we ordered, Salmon, Halibut, and Snapper.  They were seasoned well. Unfortunately, the snapper had a couple of small bones and scale. We shared the chocolate souffle for dessert.

A year ago we tried to go for our anniversary dinner and when we got to the restaurant, they had a broken water pipe and had to close. It was a sat night and everywhere we liked was booked. Sharon walked us over to Gordon Ramsey Steak, spoke with the manager and in moments we had a great table. We didn't forget the gesture and returned a year later. I phoned ahead and when we arrived she had the best table you could ask for waiting for us. We had a seat directly across from the Bellagio fountains and saw the show 4 times during our meal. We ordered a la carte with a bottle of wine after a couple cocktails and were happy with everything. The Escargot and the steak tartare were both excellent and the filet Rossini was beautifully prepared, plenty of fois gras and excellent sauce. The meal began with a couple amuse bouche and a few complimentary deserts came along afterwards then we had the souffles, one grand mariner and one carmel, both perfect. It was a perfect meal and I can't wait to go back. Thanks again to Sharon , our waitress Carmen, a very helpful sommelier and the whole staff.",

    "text": "This is definitely one of the more romantic restaurants on the Strip.  I took my GF to dinner here shortly after we first met and asked for one of the tables by the window, which offered us stunning 180-degree views of the Bellagio fountains that made us both swoon.  The restaurant is located in the Paris Hotel's scaled down Eiffel Tower of course and is serviced by a single elevator, which sort of adds some fun and a sense of exclusivity to your evening.  The dining room is intimate, with both booths and floating tables scattered around.  Everything is about the views here, so almost every table has a least a peek of the fountains.  However, there is this odd waiter's station in one corner that I was seated by when I treated my family to dinner on another visit that completely blocked our table's view, which was a bit of a let down.  Steer away from that area if possible.  The cuisine here is French of course, and while it is certainly well prepared, nothing really ever stands out for me.  This is usually the case with themed or view restaurants;  They live in their own niche and therefore don't really have to compete with others in their category.  Thus, in terms of food there are certainly more impressive restaurants in the area, but they don't have these views.  Note that I'm not knocking the food here;  Just don't expect it to be an epic Michelin 3 diamond experience and you'll be fine.  The service has been top notch each and every time I've eaten here, although the kitchen is a little less accommodating.  Last visit my old-school father wanted a baked potato with his entree, but the chef flatly refused the request (even though there were obviously potatoes in the house).  My parental unit was about to do the diner scene from Five Easy Pieces on them, but the waiter was very professional and calmed him down, talking him into another one of the sides on the menu, thank God.  Reservations are an absolute must and sometimes they'll ask for a credit card and bill you a non-refundable fee ($50, if memory serves, which is applied to your check) to place it.  I've noticed a few other places do this as well;   I guess it stops people from scatter bombing reservations at a bunch of places for the same evening and then cancelling last minute once they make their choice.  If you just want to come up and take a peek, they do have a bar, but it's been totally packed every time I've been here.  I don't know if they do the velvet rope thing or not to limit the crowds, but expect to wait for a bar seat if you decide to make the trip.  Long and short:  A four star French restaurant with five star views. Definitely one of those places you must try at least once.  Perfect for a special night out, a proposal, or an anniversary.  Highly recommended.    Bon Appetit!",

    "text": "I have two sets of comments here, one for the general public, and the other for the truly discriminating foodie.  First, if you're looking for a lovely dining experience, you won't be disappointed.  Everything that came out of the kitchen was presented beautifully, the pacing was good, the ambiance, lovely.  Probably 'nuff said here, but if you're a foodie, read on.  I have to lead with the wired, Secret Service earpieces the waitstaff sported.  As you exit the elevator, you're facing the state of the art kitchen, and beehive efficient staff.  If you have lead time on your reservation, do request a table overlooking the Bellagio's fountains.  It's a mesmerizing view.  Casual diners, stop here.  Foodies, read on.  Now for the prix fixe.  98 pp for the meal, an additional 69 pp for the wine pairings, and if you're dining as a couple, you will both need to opt in.   The amuse bouche was the prelude, and consisted of an onion vichyssoise with a white fish top that was divine.  After this there were three petits of smoked salmon, foie gras, and mushroom streudel.  The foie gras was served atop an almost meringue-light crouton, but it was still too much bread to balance the foie gras.   From there off to the first course - a lobster salad over cucumber papaya relish, paired with a Feuillatte blush champagne.  This is, of course, where my palate first deviates from the sommelier's, as I didn't find the blush, well, necessary.  I would have been perhaps happier with a light champagne or chardonnay/chablis sparkling.  Lobster, in my opinion, should always be the star of the show.   The next course was the butternut squash bisque, and that pairing was literally too close for comfort.  No, really, the Pinot Gris was astoundingly similar to the soup.  In this case, I would have looked for a little more contrast.  The soup was quite wonderful.  Sea bass was served next, over a bed of smoky tomato quinoa that was nothing short of brilliant (the quinoa; not the bass, which I actually found a little leathery and over-done.)  A quintessentially Russian River chardonnay was served; I would have gone for something un-oaked and less buttery.  I love it when a restaurant *knows* how the beef should be cooked; just a few degrees shy of medium rare.  Paired with the perfect Ferrari-Carano blend, these tiny prime beef roulades were absolutely top-notch.  Prime beef roulade, horseradish mousseline and a nod to brussels sprouts  I can't comment on the dessert wine, as they are not to my taste, and beyond my scope. Clos Uroulat.  What I can tell you is to scratch the apple streudel with cinnamon ice cream right off your list of considerations - the pastry was tough enough to need a knife, and the filling, totally forgettable.  Way too heavy-handed on the raw sugar as well.   By contrast, however, the White Chocolate Banana Elysium (I believe they called it), was a work of art (photo attached).  If you got to the end of this whole review, without thinking I'm  certifiable, you better link to me.  I want to read your reviews, too.  Overall, the restaurant experience was excellent, and someplace I could recommend without hesitation.  Bon Appetit!",

    "text": "maybe not my very favorite meal, but was excellent in every way.  my hubby and me went here as our last meal.  our last day we were leaving the paris and walked by and randomly made a reservation.  we figured it was an over priced old lady restaurant!   our favorite part of vegas are the fountains, so we figured lets watch them while eating dinner.  our midnight flight meant that we could not change all day so we were both dressed in sneakers.  no joke- from the menu downstairs we had no idea how lavish a restaurant it was upstairs.  so imagine a friday night arriving and being surrounded by evening attire!  many people were celebrating, many women in long gowns.  but the treatment we were given was ultra professional.  i felt well taken care of. and the food!  we enjoyed their lentil soup and the salad with tulle.  the tulle was so delicious!  parmasan and poppy seeds i think. in fact it may have been my favorite part of the meal.  also, the french bread was crusty and tasty.   the salad was crispy and delicious, the soup hearty and classic.  i had fish and the hubby had pork.  both delicious.  the greens served with both seemed a bit heavy- too much butter?  but the whole experience- food, views, service was classy and very well crafted.",

    "text": "I was so looking forward to this restaurant experience, because it's one of those not too often in a lifetime, spendthrift extravaganzas. I was quite disappointed because the expense did not match the food quality or service. Whatever you do, don't order Roberto Cavalli vodka. It was $23.00 for that brand martini. I almost fell of the chair. Utterly ridiculous! Moving to our scenic table, we found the service to be lacking. We weren't greeted by waiter, busboy, anyone for several minutes. Ordering the escargot got us what seemed to be one escargot cut in half swimming  around in a filo dough, saucy conglomeration. However the manager did apologize and remove it from the tab. The rest of the meal was nothing we couldn't get anywhere else for a lot less. In fact every other restaurant I passed wherever I went made me mad that I didn't go to it instead. For half the price!  We paid $320.00 for 2 drinks, 3 wines, 2 entrees, green beans and dessert. That was 4 days ago and I'm still not over it! Way too much competition in Vegas to get away with nothing but the finest,  when that is what you're portraying.",

    "text": "If you are looking for a romantic night then the Eiffel Tower Restaurant is where to go at the Paris Hotel in Las Vegas. I just went there this past weekend with my boyfriend. We made reservations at 9:30 but got there at 9 and they still sat us right away. We sat at a table near the window which had a perfect view of the Bellagio fountains. Every ten minutes we watched the water show. Our server was very nice and knowledgeable. He picked out the perfect white wine for our meals. I got the skirt steak which was amazing. My boyfriend got the filet mignon also delicious. We shared the asparagus and gratin potatoes as our sides since the menu is a la carte. Of course we had to try the chocolate souffle that everyone talked about on Yelp (which is the reason we even came to this spot). And man oh man....it was soooo good. The ambiance of this fine dining restaurant is surprisingly casual. I figured since it was fine dining then it'd be full of stuck up rich folks...but that wasn't the case at all. Everyone was laughing and having a good time. It made our experience that much better. The night was magical and a perfect date! oh btw - the bill came out to $193...not including tip but worth every single penny!",
