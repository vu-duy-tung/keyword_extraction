The pizza was good but they took too long to make the pizza that everyone wanted. They kept making other pizzas that nobody was asking for. Their cinnamon rolls are delicious if you get it right away. Their bread sticks are amazing. The pasta was dry & needed to be cooked longer because it was still a little hard. Didn't get to try the ice cream because the ice cream maker broke down. It was super packed. Very loud. Many different themed rooms to sit & eat in. All buffet style, all you can eat. They have a small bar for the adults.",

    "text": "Price wasn't bad. The food was ok. What ruined the experience for me was the clientele. Before we even went to get our food a fight breaks out between 2 parties so we were forced to find another room to sit. Saw people grabbing food off the line with their bare hands instead of using provides utensils. Saw multiple kids dispensing ICEE and soda into their hands...disgusting. Maybe their parents didn't want to pay for drinks? Which brings up a good point...include the drink in the price of the buffet!  Every other buffet in this town does. On a positive note my children greatly enjoyed the games and rides provides here. Love the fact that the tickets you in are kept track on the play card so you don't have to carry stings of tickets around after killin it on the skeeball machine. If it were up to me I probably wouldn't come back but since in have young children it'll be hard to keep that promise.",

    "text": "Overall this place is pretty awesome.. And if you have small kids or nieces and nephews you'll pretty much end up coming one way or another... I ended up being there on a slower night, a Wednesday as I decided to surprise my 26yr old boyfriend with a small party between him and his friends to check out what the fuss was all about and as a goofy memory to remember later on. There's a large variety of games which is cool for both adults and children.. Angry birds on a large screen, air hockey, bumper cars, floppy bird, a little bowling alley and many more. The pricing for the games isn't too bad either as its done with a preloaded game card and it's done with a credit system and you can always check your balance on. 2 downsides to this place that I found.. 1. You have to pay to come in, no matter what. If you're hosting a party there, I would say to let your guests know ahead of time if it's there first time attending as it can be confusing the moment you walk in. The fee is suppose to cover the buffet pricing... Which leads to the 2nd downside.. The buffet.. It's just not good and there were so many items missing on the night I attended. There's a salad bar, pizza bar and dessert bar.. I'm possibly missing another.. But I would say that the pizza bar was the best one. No real complaints here- just kinda wish there was a way to go there for just the gaming opportunity then having to pay for buffet pricing to come in..",

I gotta express myself. Bc I wasn't gonna yell at the inexperienced assistant managers or the lost and confused \"manager\". Everyone's checking in gets a bad attitude bc no ones on the same page. The reason for my review here today was bc. I reserved ahead of time for a b-day party. When they took us to our area there was no reserved tables. My family was scattered everywhere in there sectional rooms in between other guest the whole night. . It took them 1/2 hour to clean and pull tables together so half of us can be together. This is after already had to wait to get in. . (So pissed) Ok I only spent 700 dollars here. I'm just saying money is good anywhere. So expect disappointment. It is over priced for the quality of food and service John's has to offer.. For big parties they offered to bring full pizzas to the tables, they never did... U decide moms. It pissed this dad off all they tried to give me was a $30 credit vip card. That's 2 kids no game time. Maybe your good for party of 2. It won't be so bad. (It's new and none of the self portrait machines work) sorry selfies CHUCK-e does take pride in memorable days. This is a kids place and dudes be coming here with open carry weapons. And the managers know it. She noticed it when I was the next complaint waiting patiently.. Frustrated managers must be getting divorced soon.. (Work sucks babe super hectic today!) They get it left and right all day long. (Complaints that is) Enjoy.. Cheers mates! I won't be back. And 60 other people that witnessed it with me won't be back either for there events. (Shady place) bring a liter of sanitizer kids end up with black hands form filthy gaming area) blame the host bc managers don't care.",

    "text": "We had a birthday party event here on Monday February 8th for our son's 6th birthday. Booking the event was flawless. Our server for the event, Amber, was also good. She had gone over the sequence of events with my wife and was very attentive to our needs. The manager, Brie, stopped into the room one time. She waved my wife numerous times to get her to settle the remaining balance outside the room which was in my eyes unprofessional. We were told that their mascot was going to come into the room to say happy birthday to our son..they didn't. They played a few games in the room but had to move tables to play.  Seemed to be a little unorganized especially when Amber asked my wife to be in charge of the music system during the games. We had ordered two pizzas that came out the same time they brought our cake into the room (after about 20 minutes) so we had requested if we could take it home with us. Amber came back into the room with a white 13 gallon kitchen trash bag and said that her manager said to give it to us to use..definitely a bad first impression when this happened. When we tipped Amber she counted it right in front of our face..again, unprofessional.  We filled out a survey, but no response from \"corporate\" to follow up.  For a kids birthday party it was a great value. The kids had fun which is the most important part, but the place needs a little work in their professional and managerial skills.",

    "text": "I came for my nephew's birthday party on a Saturday afternoon. It wasn't packed at 3:30 p.m.  It was my first time at John's Incredible Pizza. I expected an arcade, but I had no idea it had a buffet & rides.  For how much the buffet is per person, it was overpriced for the quality. I was not a fan of the food. It also wasn't clean. There were plates, forks & cups that clearly were not washed all the way, which is a big turn-off for me.  I did like the themed rooms, which each had a different vibe & a lot of tables to sit at for your group. My brother didn't book a party, but it's easy to get together & set-up an area in a room.  All the kids received a game card with $5, which is 20 credits. The games seemed to average at ~2-4 credits & rides ~8-10 credits. Each time you swipe, you can see the remaining credits you have & you can have tickets won transfer to the card.  I was going to ride a ride with my nieces, but because one of my nieces was under the height requirement & needed an adult, I was able to ride the ride for free.  Overall, I can see that this is a spot for kids to have fun & it stands out with the rides, but the buffet quality & cleanliness is what makes me think this place is a no-go.",

Had to ask them to change out the pasta cause it was dried up. The chicken was over cooked and looked like a piece of rubber. Don't think I'd eat that food again. Also took an hour for someone to clean off our table. After we played the games we waited for at least 30 min for someone to come help us. A lady came over to tell us they were helping other people on the rides first and we had to wait another 15 min cause they only had one girl working. RIDICULOUS! This place was a joke! Prices are way too high and definitely not worth it. I don't recommend this place save your money and go somewhere else.",

For the amount of money spent I just feel we should of been able to hang until we were done. Which we stayed another 30 min .  The buffet was great!  Turning & burning pizzas and what nots .   My first time there was a little confusing but it all worked out. We sat in the room w the big screen tv! Our servers in that room were wonderful ! Always on it w rebounding dishes and making sure the room was clean!  At times customers were being rude and just throwing food on the table! These employees are not your servants!

We had a family gathering here for my nephews 10th birthday. My 80 year old grandmother who was only attending for the joy of celebrating with her family was not allowed in without paying for a full price buffet even though she had no intentions of eating. After speaking to a \"manager\" they decided to allow her entry but only after being forced to pay a $2 fee... unacceptable...  NONE of the food was stocked. When we asked where the food was we got nothing but attitude from the kids working who seemed like we were bothering them by asking for the food we paid for. There were 10 different kids of desserts listed, 7 of which were empty. We were told the items had to be made and one hour later they made EIGHT cinnamon rolls. There is three times that amount of people in our party alone.   The silverware, trays and plates were not clean at all. You do get what you pay for but for the $12 (that you're forced to pay to celebrate a family members birthday) you shouldn't have to worry about hygiene and germs. This place is literally disgusting, unaccommodating and should be ashamed of themselves for the way they treated my grandmother.",

    "text": "So this place has a pretty cool concept and looks awesome. Buffet, multiple themed dining rooms, private party rooms, games, rides, and prizes... The facility itself is nice...   BUT...  Came here for a party on a Sunday afternoon, and it was CRAZY busy. As in, watch your step or you'll probably trip over someone.   When we first got here, seems like they were able to keep the food up with the crowd... But by the time we were about ready to leave a couple hours later, there were lots of ppl waiting around empty food displays.. And, only one ice cream dispenser was working at first, by the time we left, that one wasn't working either. Otherwise, I kinda like their buffet, especially for a kid party. But they have a decent salad bar with the lettuce looking clean and crisp.. And I like their Alfredo pizza, garlicky!   The play area is huge, geared mostly for grade school kids, but there's also a few games and a play area for the younger ones... A noticed several games \"out of order\", which is kinda surprising given that this place is relatively new...   So I think this place is a decent place to bring your kids, on a not so busy day (if that exists in this town). They may still need to work on how to handle the crowd..   And some tips for you PARENTS...   Teach your kids to share! If they see a line of kids waiting to play a game, don't sit there playing it OVER & over... Play it once (or maybe even twice) then get back at the end of the line!   And...   Just because you are \"all together\" in a group, doesn't give the 5 of you the right to cut in front of the long line of waiting KIDS, because you decided to join the ONE lady and kid actually waiting in line (in front of me). So yea, the passive me spoke up, and yea, I didn't let you cut. That's just rude! I swear my earrings were about to come off, hold my purse! Haha totally jk.   Yeaaah, for a much better experience, come here midweek or something.",

Half the games are broken. Great concept lots and lots of work to make it better. For 10.99 you can get a crap buffet any where in this town with many more options that are available. Endless lines of empty trays. Here's an idea pay more staff and cook more food. Clean your floors and bathrooms. Just close and start over. I attempted to talk to who I believed to be the GM. Tall and gray older man. He said what can I go for you sir. I explained I was at the establishment with 19 other people. Business owners in the food industry as well. I told him the place was messy, no food, rude staff, and down right filthy. He said I'm sorry you feel that way and he walked away. Really what a bum.",

    "text": "This place sure beats chuck e cheeses out of the park except for the live entertainment part that kids love. The place is huge and busy. It is pretty cheap for a family night out to enjoy some games and pizza. There are different seating areas to fit the mood and age requirements. I.e. Bar and sports lounge, music video room and children eating rooms full of cartoons. Johns pizza offers a soft serve salad bar full of food to pick up. Not only there is a soda fountain, but they provided a slushy machine too. At the entertainment area, there are a ton of arcade games families can enjoy together. There are also several attractions to productively interact in. For the little children who couldn't reach height requirement, there is a little play area for them. They have a mini golf course, miniature bowling alley, bumper cars, and rides. Keep in mind it's not an amusement park, so it's not that big. Please enjoy when u see my post",

    "text": "I could not wait for this place to open. I have been to two of these in California and they were so much. The variety of pizza and games was so fun. I was able to go to this location a few days after it had opened and I was very disappointed. I had talked this place up to my family and my son so much they were very excited as well. Of course there was a long line but we got through it pretty fast. They even handed out fresh bread sticks while we waited. Once we got in we found a room with movie screens all over with cartoons and other things to keep kids entertained. I thought that was great but the audio was to loud and it made hard to talk across the table. The buffet was ok, they had a hard time keeping up with the pizza and people were waiting around for certain pizzas. The bread sticks on the buffet line were the opposite of the ones we got in line because they were dry and crunchy. When we went for dessert my son wanted only ice cream and of course both of their machines had signs saying they were out of order. While picking the dessert we wanted we saw people trying the ice cream machines and they were working fine. Yet they had signs saying out of order. We got out to the games next and started looking over how everything worked. It was a bit confusing because sometimes the card readers didnt work and we wondered how e-tickets worked. All of the games were fun and the rides were pretty cool. Definitely a step up from chuck e cheese and game works. The one thing I didnt like was paying 2.50 for the mini golf ball then having to give it back at the end on the last hole. There were just so many people there that night it wasnt much fun at all. I figured we could go back and do it during the day mid week.  So a few weeks later I took my son mid day on a thursday. As we were paying I saw the manager asking our cashier questions on how the packages worked and how to bill customers out for it, he had interrupted about 3 times. Once we got in it was so nice and very relaxed compared to the first time. When we went to the buffet I noticed that 5-6 different spots for pizza just had covers on them and were not being used. The variety of pizza was almost half of dinner time which was frustrating because the price was the same as dinner but with less selection. When walking back to our seats I saw the same manager cleaning the bar area and acting as if he was working the bar, which I thought was weird. We ate and went to play a few games, when we came back our entire table was cleaned off. They told us to leave our ticket face up and they wouldnt clean the table, but they did. so we went back and got for more food. While eating we needed more napkins so we got up to grab more napkins and they cleaned our table again before we got back. I went and complained to the manage and he said they are just short staffed today and the staff was just trying to stay on top of it. We went back out to do more game and some of the card readers were not working. We tried to go do the bowling and that same manager was there with another worker walking up and down the lanes and in the back of the alleys. I asked if we could use the lanes and they said there was only one ball and they did not know where the rest of the bowling balls went. They said it appeared someone may have stole them! The manager said he was looking around trying to find them but as we walked out I looked up and there was a camera in the bowling area, not sure why he was standing there scratching his head instead of looking at tape. We decided to go get dessert and come back to the games in a little bit. We got a few things and of course when we got back our table was cleared again. As we ate I my son got ice cream on his hands so we got up really quick and went to the bathroom to wash our hands. The sinks are very unique, they have a hand dryer and water faucet combo, its very cool but doesnt work well. its very obvious how they work but the dryer part would not stay on and kept shutting off. It was very frustrating but we got all cleaned up really quick and headed back to our table. And you guessed it, they cleaned our table. We were gone maybe a minute and a half. I went back up to the same manager and told him they cleaned our table again and how it was so frustrating they kept cleaning our table even when we got up to clean our hands really fast. He again said they are just trying to stay on top of it, he didnt even apologize for what was happening. I told him This was so frustrating that we were just going to leave and he said he would go talk to the staff, the same thing he said to us earlier and it did nothing. I was very disappointed once again with this place so we will not be back for a long time. Hopefully its just the beginning and they can get the kinks worked out and we can try it later. As for now I am sticking the chuck e cheese. Even my son said he liked chuck e cheese better and hes 4, hes an expert on these places.",

For a pizza a place you think it would be at least good pizza..nope...little Caesar's was way better..which is cheap and poor quality as well.The only thing that was decent was the icees....Then we went on to play games and half of them didn't work or broke down as we were playing ,so it ate our credits down..the rides were 10 credits each so we only got to ride 3 but they were fun.And then the prizes were extremely high prices so we got dinky toys for 600 tickets!needless to say I'll likely goto Chucky cheese before I ever go back here..DAVE AND BUSTERS ,I think is the best so far..I spent 120 on 6 people but I will save my money and stomach for something better!oh I forgot it was my son's birthday and we left a gift bag on the table and went and played games and when we came back it was gone!

We got there around 11:30am and went straight to the Buffet area. There wasn't really much of a selection, chicken and pizza needed to be replenished as well as the salad area. We went to the room with Disney decorations. I was pretty amazed to see how big the room was. After we finished eating we went to the arcade area, played for a little bit. Before we left we grabbed desert and went back to the same room and sat down at a different table. When we were about to leave I noticed that our plates from earlier were still at our first table. Overall it was a good experience, I really enjoyed the pizza and the chicken.",

I waited a good 5-10 min along with 10 other customers just to get some chicken that did not taste that good at all... The food is horrible and plain plus it looks so nasty like parents don't care and let their kids serve them selfs. It really just grossed me out, so food wise I rate it a zero!!!!  So when we got to the play area we got the card which I like that better then carrying tokens around. I did not like how long they took checking the cards that took like 5 minutes each person just to get in the rides, also some of the seats In the twister they did not fill them up with 4 people instead they put two people on each knowing they had a huge line... (And the workers they look miserable sadly this is a kids place at least act happy)A majority of the games did not work we were so exited to play them and like a good six games were out of order. I did enjoy the bumper cars that was fun and some other games. But I would not dine here maybe just bring the kids to play!!!!",

And when talking to an employee they said it just wasn't mixed right. Than you should of never put it out. They said they mixed it and I work in the culinary and never have I seen it look like that. Plus doesn't look like they were fully staffed for both the arcade and the dining area. I have been here a few times because my kids like the games but for the price you pay for the buffet they need to do a better job. I mean for being in Vegas and competing with the buffets here they need to step it up.",

    "text": "I went to John's Incredible Pizza Company on Sunday evening about 3 hours before their closing at 930.  At first me and my boyfriend were really shocked that it cost $50 for entry. Our two adult fares for $14.48 and my 3 y.o. fare for $7.48 and then another $10 for about 40 credits to play with in the Arcade. At first we did not want to but we decided with the included buffet and additional activities apart from the arcade the fare would be worth it. Plus Sea Quest was closed and we wanted our little guy to enjoy his weekend evening. Since we went straight to the arcade we didn't really pay much attention to anything else but did notice about 10% of the games were broken -- not a big deal-- our son is young enough that things like this don't matter to him. We decide it's finally time to try out the buffet and we're severely disappointed: dirty tongs and nothing but old dried out pizza -- seemed like they were missing very many flavors as well -- a messy pasta station with low pasta sauces that needed replacing and wrappers and mess everywhere. Again we mostly shrugged this off as we know Vegas is a messy place and the business looked severely understaffed. There was nobody behind the buffet counters and I only saw one or two employees running cups out or a rare pizza from the kitchen. We went to the salad bar which was a little better but were extremely disappointed that the entirety of our visit (almost 2 hours) the dessert bar was never refilled -- just dirty tongs, scattered plates and an empty kitchen and bins. Both ice cream machines were broken and every other soda machine ice dispenser was brok, etc. I saw someone waiting for an extended time at the \"bar\" area and even asking an employee to please call the bartender to serve him a drink and when I came back to double check on the dessert bar -- still no treats :( !! -- he was still impatiently waiting for help. My boyfriend said there were no paper towels in the bathroom and nothing but trash on the floor. Every dining room was dirty and each table needed wiping down. I wiped down our table myself and went in search for a trash can which was surprisingly nowhere to be found -- in fact when I asked the waitress where the trash can was she simply took my dirty napkin from me and added it to her other hand also full of dirty napkins. We were severely dissatisfied with our visit to Johns Incredibl(y) (dirty gross and understaffed) pizza company and unfortunately we will not be returning anytime soon. I recommend you save your money and go to Chuckee Cheese instead or the McDonald's play area down the street.",

I mean they don't have much of a buffet, they should have atleast 2 pizzas of each kind, not one and we have to keep waiting. My family wanted regular cheese and so did other families and they literally had one mini one and 5 min for another, then 10 min the lady said next. The salad bar doesn't have much, no onions, cheese, no regular stuff and the dressings are so scary looking. The prizes also are sooooo high with tickets and they don't even have cheap ticket little prizes. Sometimes little kids don't get many tickets. We were like 4 tickets short for a 150 ticket prize and there was nothing we could do because the guy said he couldn't hook it up. This place should be about fun and seeing kids smile, geez 5 tickets short is not that big of a deal. My kids were not impressed with this place.",

I really appreciate when other people take the initiative to try to help others when she could of just finished on her busy day and left me since i don't ask or bother to ask people for help.

We were taken to the party room pretty quickly which was great. We only have limited Time to spend in the room and also to have fun with the games and rides, our time was from 8-11pm. Once we leave the party room and start up our game cards we can not re-enter the party room which is a bummer. The 3 girls that were helping us had no clue what they were doing. They did not even know how to work the radio which took time from playing the \"games\" that were chosen for the kids to play.  Once we got out to the arcade area and the kids received their game cards. They went crazy and of course, as kids that they are, couple of them lost their card. Their game card system should be reevaluated because.. Once we told a worker it was lost, they blindly deactivated a card that \"might have\" been the one that was lost but not 100% sure. He just deactivated the one that was used on the last ride it was used on BUT a few of the kids were also on that ride too! The one that got deactivated was actually the BIRTHDAY GIRL'S! So a suggestion, have the cards be specifically named for the person not just card 1, 2 or 3.   The buffet portion of the restaurant is pretty awesome. They have different types of pizza, pasta, salads, lots of desserts. Also they have Icee for the kids which is pretty cool. They also have alcohol for the big kids lol. That gets a star for sure.  I still can't believe where this place is located is where Dillard's used to be!",

    "text": "4.5 stars.   Had to update my review as I recently visited for a 2 year old's party. Sunday afternoon at 11am and the place was refreshingly empty! The party room was spotless and well-decorated for a kid's party. The staff were all friendly and accommodating. The ones making balloon animals were so patient and kind with the kids, and they even taught some of the adults some balloon-animal-making skills. Staff were constantly clearing away our empty plates and asking if we needed anything. I'm not sure how much the party host paid for this, but it seems to be worth EVERY penny not to have to clean up after your toddler's party LOL. I went to another toddler's party recently at Bouncy World in Henderson, and this far surpassed in terms of service and ambiance.   Each kiddo received a card pre-loaded with 60 points, 2 rides, and some bonus tickets. I thought this was extremely generous for a party! We got tons of play time, and our toddler got to do everything he wanted and more.   As a parent, I realize that I've started to judge experiences according to how they benefit my children, and not how \"happy\" they make me, LOL. So if I were rating this place simply on my own rating scale, it would be 3 stars. The food isn't that good. They don't offer any juices for the kids. It can get pretty crowded and some of the games/machines don't work properly. But my son had a BLAST, and so did all the others at the party. And I was pretty impressed by the service.   That half star comes off simply because of the location (ugh, the Boulevard mall). Also, I do think they should give out the cards for play a bit earlier on in the party.   I will definitely be keeping this on the radar for a party in the future!",

    "text": "Im sorry but there is nothing really incredible about this company. For starters, why are drinks like soda, coffee, icees, etc not included in your buffet price which is $1.99 more? What is pizza without soda?  Here's the lowdown.  Adults 13 and older: $11.49 Seniors 55 and older: $10.49 Kids 2 and under: Free with paying adult Kids 3 to 6: $5.29 Kids 7 to 12: $7.29  Weekday Lunch Special Monday through Friday 11 am to 3 pm Adults: $8.29 Seniors: $7.29  Military Discount for members, their spouse and children are 10 percent off with ID.  There is an express entrance meaning you skip the line and walk right in. This is an online purchase only for an additional purchase of 5 bucks a person.  They serve alcohol which in my opinion is a bad thing.  Beer (Blue Moon, Bud Light, Dos Equis Lager, Lagunitas, Stella Artois) Regular $5.29 Large $7.29  Wine By The Glass (Robert Mondavi: Chardonnay, Merlot, Moscato) $8.29  Margaritas (Lime or Strawberry) $5.29  As I mentioned above, the fact that there is alcohol available here is not a good idea. How are you gonna look after your kids if you are buzzin or worse yet, drunk. Then you have to worry about driving home safely. Im surprised I havent heard more stories of people fighting because they are drunk.   As for the food, its similar to Cici's Pizza but with a little more options and the quality is just slightly better.  Service wise it is also similar to Cici's and Chuck E Cheese. The staff tries to keep up with the cleaning of tables and the floors but people nowadays are just pigs when it comes to not caring just how much of a mess they make.  The number one gripe I have with this place is that the supply for the demand is not always met in an orderly manner especially when it gets really busy. Sometimes you will see people just standing there waiting for things to be replenished. To add to that, if there are no available tables for people just now showing up, you have a 2 hour limit at the table you are sitting at. I have been here about 4 times and it happened twice where we had to leave our table after about 2 hours because new incoming people did not have a table to sit at. Given the fact that most of the employees are teenagers still in high school, the way the place is run is sometimes very questionable.  In closing, I rank this place slightly higher than Cici's and Chuck E Cheese. All three places you will never find more positives than negatives. If these guys resolve the supply demand and keep the place alcohol free this would easily be a 4 star review. Until then, It's just an ok place to come to occasionally.

    "text": "My daughter dropped her unused gaming card in the booth of the restaurant which they were unable to recover. In the beginning we purchased 2 gaming cards which had 140 credits in each card and in order to get her a new one they needed the other card to identify which card is which along with the receipt and that was fine.  So the lady who I assumed was a manager gave us a replacement card for the lost one. My daughter uses it and nothing was on the card. Went back again to customer service which inconvenienced my son who had the other card had to come back up to customer service to show them the card again and another \"manager\" said the \"dropped card\" credits went into the 2nd card. My husband said no there was only 92 credit left. Manager not listening to us as we explained how we got this in the first place. She still said they transferred the credits in the 2nd card. Eventually they managed to get it right  During this whole exchange one of their workers stood by smirking at my husband and my husband pointed out to this manager tell your worker to stop it and she said oh he doesn't work here he's waiting on someone else. Which was a lie because he had the same work pants as everyone else. As soon as we left that \"worker\" went up to to her and started talking.  An hr later that same worker was now inside talking to another worker by the Buffett are knowing he was definitely a worker.    Overall Next time I'd rather spend the extra cash at Game Works or Dave and Busters and have at least a decent pizza.  Food wasn't that great either. That was my first and last time there. I felt bad because we were there for my 10 year old. He had fun and that's all that matters.  PS.. I only see a response from them if you give them all 5 stars",

    "text": "If i could rate it less than one star, i would.   First of all, there's a line that stretches to the sidewalk if it was a special day or something. When you get in there, it smells like how a child's dirty hands smell (you know, the smell if they didn't wash their hands after using the bathroom etc) Food options for salad are okay, pasta is mediocre because it's just four to choose from, pizza is alright (barely), but the dessert \"bar\" is so disappointing and gross looking. I was looking forward to the pasta, however, it was so tasteless! I bet if John's Pizza hired my mum, they'd have more success because she actually seasons food and the sauce wouldn't have much of a watery consistency. Really disappointed with the pasta part and the dessert bar, there was literally nothing to get from there except ice cream from the machine.   Be careful when you're walking back to your seat with your tray because some people will blatantly walk in front of you and out of nowhere just turn, almost causing you to drop your food.   Oh yeah, the staff barely even assists. Tables are dirty and not cleaned up until one of them sees that you're about to sit in one of the tables. I'd do a much better job cleaning up all the areas if they accepted my application. Anyways, i didn't try the gaming areas because they were all packed and waiting til somebody was done with one would've been a big waste of time. Save your money if you think this place is going to be fun, it's not worth it for adults, but i guess it's worth it if you want your child to play and get tired while you just eat and sort of relax.   I wouldn't come back in my opinion.",

    "text": "High hopes, big let down again.   This was my 4th visit to John's.  1st visit = bad.....Food Missing and not replaced, bad customer service.  (Yes, I do give places a second chance, they have off days.) 2nd visit = Good....no issues (Although still slow to refill food on buffet.  3rd visit = Fair....... (Still slow in food on buffet)  (Due to life being crazy busy, this post is a week late.)  So now we come to visit 4 - Last Thursday Dec 1st, I took my daughter back to John's.....having a Daddy/Daughter night.  We get to John's about 7:20 PM. Waited 15 minutes to pay for entry. One person working the register and 6 families ahead of us in line.   Finally after getting in, my daughter and I went through the food line before getting a seat.   Both Soup vats empty. Dried old crusty soup remnants sitting in the pots.   No potato fritters (Ask about them and told its going to be 15 minutes....Hmmm ok)  .....few pizzas on the buffet.   We go and sit down with our food in the Kaleidoscope seating area.   Get back up after 20 minutes and still no potatoes and no chicken. Ask the girl working in the area where's the food and she just shrugs her shoulders and says I don't know. So we grab a few more things and go back to the table.   After about 15 minutes my daughter tells me she doesn't feel well. All of a sudden she vomits all over the floor. No employees around so I begin to clean up. The first employee Ive seen in the Kaleidoscope area (female) walks in and totally oblivious, even though we are at the table right in front of her. I tell her my daughter has vomited and she says \"Oh, I'll go get someone\" and walks away. NO ONE COMES.  I am a responsible parent so I finish cleaning up the mess with the help of their little sink area thats in that room. STILL NO ONE COMES.   I have had enough at this point and I go to the front desk and ask for the manager.   A lady tells me she is the supervisor and I tell her about the missing food and the lack of customer service. Instead of first off saying she is sorry, she asks me, \"WHAT FOOD IS MISSING?\" in a demanding tone. WOW......So the customer service issues start at the management level and trickle down. So I tell her what is missing and I watch her walk over to the girl at the area with chicken and potatoes and ask her if they have been missing......the girl tells her yes. She asks her why and she doesn't have an answer. So instead of turning around and saying,\"Im sorry\" or ANYTHING she walks into the kitchen and disappears. THANKS A LOT!!   So in conclusion, honestly this was our last visit to John's. 50/50 isn't a good ratio when it comes to how a restaurant is. I shouldn't guess which one its going to be on this visit. (The lack of food seems to be every time.) The lack of customer service is bad. It's really sad because this could be a great family place. Also honestly, I think the reason my daughter got sick was because the food had been sitting so long.   HAD THE MANAGER/SUPERVISOR NOT ACTED LIKE A COMPLETE JERK, I WOULDN'T HAVE LEFT THIS REVIEW. HOWEVER, HER LACK OF CARING AND HER ATTITUDE TOWARD ME SHOWED ME THIS WAS HOW THEY HAVE DECIDED TO DO BUSINESS WHEN A PROBLEM WAS BROUGHT UP.",

Don't buy the drink soda cups are at the soda station and they will never look at a receipt to verify you wasted your 2$. After looking at my receipt I found out I was charged an additional 1$ priority check in fee... because my wife wasn't actually there when I swiped my card she was in the car getting my daughters sippy cup. Food was complete trash, pizza was beyond stale, and everything me and my family touched was practically inedible. Nobody in my group of 6 ever finished a single plate. Games were decent, same price as Dave and busters, just not as many games. Glad I got to try it, now I know never to go back. Go to Dave and busters if your looking for this type of environment, foods the same price, games are as well, and you get unlimited free play on half their games.",

With clear red letter, 500 showed up on top of the screen. When we were ready to check out, we were told we only had 100+ tickets. After speaking to 2 associates and a manager named amber, we were repeatedly told that \"We must of been confused\". My daughter, whose 4, understood the game and what had happened but apparently my husband and I cant comprehend how to play this game. The manager gave us 20 tickets because she felt \"bad for us.\" and told us we could buy tickets.  We considered it but truthfully unless you have 2000+ tickets the toys are pretty cheap.  If Amber honored the 500 tickets like she should have, they toy would've cost maybe 3 dollars retail at the store.  My daughter was crushed because she didn't want anything with her 100+ tickets. Thank god for amazon prime, she picked out a toy and her world is better again. My suggestion to you is take pictures of winning tickets or print them out. DO NOT PUT THEM ON A CARD!! Maybe a little while before I decide to return with my kiddos.",

There's such a huge selection of food and again on all the times we've been, it's always been stocked. There are so many choices of pasta (spaghetti, fettuccine, macaroni, pene) and all kinds of different sauces like marinara, meat sauce, Alfredo and even cheese sauce. Same goes for different types of salads and dressings, plus all the toppings you could ever think of to put on a salad. The restrooms are always clean, the arcade area is always clean, if there's ever a problem with a machine they resolve it for you right away.

    "text": "It was Monday night, and baby it was cold outside, but no problem, we wandered in here with the kids, drawn like moths to a flame by the colorful sign, and were immediately engulfed in a tropical swamp of teeming humanity (at least, some of them were). There was a long line to pay, and I  realized it was a holiday and we may have erred, but we were already jammed in with at least four families cramming in behind us, so we decided to tough it out.  And tough you must be to make it through a night in this hellhole of disorganization. The median age of the employees appeared to be about 17, and they all had the enthusiasm of teenagers everywhere who are working for minimum wage and would rather be anywhere else.  The place is actually pretty clean, but suspect that is more a testament to its relative newness than to any effort put in by the staff.  The buffet had a lot of items - correction: the buffet had spaces for a lot of items. The salad bar boasted empty containers of mushrooms, cucumbers, croutons, vinaigrette, and ranch. Two varieties of soup were offered, but only one pot actually contained any. The pizzas were the cheap, puffy, doughy kind with a faint reddish smear of sauce and a few scattered ingredients, and were torn apart by grimy little grasping hands as soon as they appeared. They also had fried chicken (I saw only legs), and signs indicated there were mashed potatoes, corn, croquettes, and other sides to be had, but those were also an illusion.   There actually were some bread sticks, of quality comparable to the Olive Garden, which floats some people's boats, and a few varieties of pasta and some empty sauce pots.  The dessert bar featured a tray of what had been apple crisp in another life, but was now a few mummified fragments of brown fruit studded with a couple of hardened clumps of oatmeal. \"Cheesecake\" was the kind you make from a mix and doesn't require baking, (there were two pieces, both flopped upside down and smashed and abandoned), and some dry and tasteless squares of something that claimed to some sort of peach delight. Hmmm.  On the other hand, one of the more ambitious employees had just got around to replacing the cinnamon rolls (warm, sweet, and gooey), fresh warm chocolate chip cookies that weren't half bad, and some little freshly fried donuts that were fluffy on the inside and just a little crispy/greasy n the outside. OK then.  The soft serve (I hesitate to call it ice cream) machines were labeled to give the impression that chocolate and swirl flavors were available, but only the vanilla worked.  So, I was not pleased that we had paid for a mandatory buffet that was mostly non-existent, but figured most of the staff must have been assigned to the \"Fun World\" attractions in the back. Ha!  You guessed it - the line for the (very fun looking) bumper cars was snaking around since about half of them didn't work, and just when Little guy got to the front, they decided to stop and fix them. Fine, except \"fixing\" involved a lot of idle chatter and standing around. The little teacup ride wasn't working at all, nor were about a third of the games. The situation was exacerbated by the size of the crowd; you had to wait like a vulture and grab at anything that opened up, whether it was what the kids wanted to play or not.   We were so irritated that no way were we gong to wait for the lackadaisical attendants at the prize desk to cash in for some crappy prizes, so we were just gong to grab a balloon for Little girl at the stand on the way out. Guess what- they don't take cash- they want you to get back in line.  No thanks. Never again.",

    "text": "John's Incredible Pizza Co. is almost a unique place.  I can best describe it as Chuck E. Cheese's meets Cici's Pizza.  Though John's takes the best ideas of each and improves upon them.    The Chuck E. Cheese aspect is in the arcade section in the back of John's.  There are standard arcade games like the type that you shoot aliens or fly hover cars around a race track.  There are further arcade game still.  The type that give you tickets for your winnings.  But these are all updated games new(ish) to the 21st century.  I believe I saw such current obsessions like Angry Birds.  If it is not enough to have built upon the gaming aspect of Chuck E. Cheese, John's has added rides like bumper cars and some sort of dizzying spin ride.  They also have a miniature bowling alley and a half hole (9 hole) black light mini golf course.  Taking a page from Dave and Buster's, John's has token cards for all their games and attractions rather than physical coinage.  There is a lot going on here.  It would have been more entertaining if all the various games were functional.  Many weren't which was disappointing.  It was also kind of hot in there given all the people running around and all the arcade games bleeding the local power grid dry.  The Cici's Pizza idea of a pizza buffet is amplified here.  The salad bar has options to choose from both in full salad fixings and dressings.  It is a standard buffet salad bar but a noticeable and appreciated improvement over Cici's.  Some with the pizza.  There are more varieties and better quality pizzas at John's.  I wasn't so sure about it going in but I was impressed.  It isn't the best pizza I've had but also far from the worst.  The food doesn't end here either.  There are several pasta selections.  All pasta is undressed allowing for you the customer to customize your meal by combining one of the many pastas with one of the many sauces.  If Italian food isn't your first choice, there is also fried chicken, mashed potatoes and a few different soups to try.  For dessert, if the crowd has not totally decimated the selection, there is a peaches and cream dessert, fresh baked chocolate chips cookies, cinnamon rolls, and my personal favorite, fresh fried doughnuts which you can watch them make.  Not a bad selection.  There are many different themed rooms for you and your party to be seated in. My group was in the Kaleidoscope room towards the front.  There is a log cabin theme room, a Disney room and some private party rooms.  Probably more that I didn't get to see.    If you chose to come to John's, be prepared to park a ways away.  And be prepared for a crowd.  This is at the Boulevard Mall and people come in droves.  You'll see families, parents and kids, running wild between the dining rooms, the buffet and the arcade.  It is a zoo akin to an amusement park.  It can be pretty fun especially for kids.  For a guy like me who would rather not be around kids, its a little too much to handle.  I was only there for a nephew's birthday.  I don't think I will make a habit of going but only because it is not a place for me.  For families, you can get some good hours of entertainment and some good food for a fair price.",

    "text": "I got to check out this place shortly after opening, as I am drawn to kooky stuff.  Make that DRAWN to kooky stuff.  The appeal of a Chuck E. Cheese style place with bumper cars, arcades, and a full on, large pizza buffet was too much to resist, so of course I had to come here.  Personally, I liked it well enough.  The buffet is huge with plenty of pizza, pasta, and salad options.  Unlike the \"slightly flavored cardboard\" taste of ol' Chuck, the variety of pizza flavors had me finding a few respectable choices.  The greatest pizza I've ever had?  Perhaps not, but I did find some unique and fun flavors to snack on.  Also, it's cheap as everything, too!  Great price for what you get.  Also for adults: The serve beer and wine and margaritas.  If the dull roar of too many kids is wearing you down, you can at least find solace in sweet, sweet booze here.  Each room has a different theme. The missus and I opted for the Tahoe style room, and it was cozy enough.  But they do have crazier choices for room themes.  The place is colorful without being overly obtrusive, and I liked all the styles.  The arcade....  Overall, I liked it.  Bumper cars, mini golf, a few rides, a few arcade style games.  I will be picky as I am a professed child of the '80's, and remember the days of rows upon rows of arcade games.  I know times change, but a \"classics\" row of some Donkey Kong, Centipede, Street Fighter II, and Ms. Pac-Man would go a long way.  Is it fun?  Yes indeed.  Am I going to drag hapless friends to it for bumper cars? Kicking and screaming, I will.  Do I hope this place sticks around?  Absolutely.  I love kitsch, and this place screams it.  Worth checking out.  Bring your goofy-hearted friends, stock up on drinks, and play some games for a pretty enjoyable outing.",

Lines everywhere ESPECIALLY in the buffet!!!! We had to wait 15minutes for a fried chicken!! People yelling at everybody!! Even salad we had to wait for it to be refilled!! Not enough food for all the people they let in!!! All our time wasted on getting in line for our food than actually enjoy our party!!! People pushing everywhere!! It was a mess!!! At some point, i actually missed chuckie cheese!! They just keep letting people in without realizing the capacity of their kitchen to provide a lot of food..  They should have a separate food area for the private party area... It was NOT worth it!! Also vape smoke smelled everyhere.. LOOOOONG lines for the rides as well!!!! Uggghhhhh!!!!",

The place is clean and so is the restroom.    Now for the games...well its a typical arcade...with variety ..for toddlers to big kids...they have some fun rides as well. Other than the bump car not working today..everything else works. To add to the arcade games and rides..they also have a glow golf and glow bowling..its for kids period..so dont expect to much.   Overall..I'm a mom of 2 little kids..and been to a lot of kids place here in town..this is by far my favorite.. I hope they keep up the cleanliness and the price..as I will definitely recommend it for others to try. lastly..I visited this place on a weekday so make your call.",

They do some really mean things to the veggies on the salad bar, slightly depressing as it effects the flavor. Baked potatoes with topping bar. Desserts leave a lot to be desired but there is a nice variety.  All of the games and rides are on a play card so it helps keep them from losing tokens and it automatically collects the tickets for them.  Prices area reasonable at about 11 bucks for adults, and great prices for kids.",

I'm used to the one in Rocklin, Ca where the machines in the arcade actually worked and the food was hot n ready to be served. I understand that it is a buffet themed dinner but the pasta station for spaghetti, penne pasta, etc. were really cold (even the meat sauce). I decided to give their fried chicken a try but needed hot sauce, so I asked one of the station workers where I can get some. She led me to the cafe dining area and handed me an empty hot sauce bottle and walked away so fast I couldn't even get her attention. That was annoying because now I have to flag someone else down and my chicken was getting cold. My children have their birthdays every year at the Rocklin, Ca location and the service was always good. I expected more from Vegas locations.",

    "text": "Went here for the first time today, and it was not nearly as bad as the other reviews said.  You go through a maze to get to the cashiers, similar to Golden Coral.  You pay for the buffet, which is a requirement to get in.  Adults and Kids 13 and over are about 11.49, this does not include drinks, but you will have to buy a drink.  I do agree it is kind of silly and they should just include it in the price even if they have to raise all the prices. Drinks are $1.99, and your choices include soda, coffee and slushies.  They do sell alcohol but that is a separate counter once you get in. You also pay for your game/ride tokens at the same time, which will get loaded to a card, similar to Dave & Busters and Game Works and even Chuck E. Cheese now.  They charge you 50 cents for a card.  There are three different costs for kids, I think 2 and under are free with a paying adult, 2-7 is another cost and Age 7-12 is 7.49.  The salad was the usual buffet salad bar. The only disappointment was the imitation bacon bits and not the real thing.  They have pasta, bread sticks, baked potatoes, rice, mashed potato, chicken, pizza, and a large variety of desserts.  I would say the only few things that were annoying was there was never sour cream for the baked potato, the butter was frozen and literally impossible to get out of the container to put on my potato and the noodles tasted water logged from boiling too long.  The pizza was way better than Chuck E. Cheese and I'd say better than CiCi's.  Now for the games and rides.  All rides have a button to push, so if there is no attendant and you want to ride, all we did was push the button and by the time there was worker we had enough people to ride the ride.  There was only two games that did not work, Fruit Ninja and a crane game to get dinosaurs.  The prices for the games were very reasonable, with the majority averaging 3 credits.  The games were alot like the ones at Dave & Busters, cost less to play but you get less tickets.    As for the employees, they are all pretty much high school and college kids.  I cannot recall seeing anyone over 25 working there.  They did not go out of their way to be friendly, but every one we engaged with (at least 4 separate ones) were pleasant and polite and helpful with whatever issue we had.  We will for sure go here again, not as much as Dave & Busters but that is because it is not in the best neighborhood.  Leaving at 9 pm on a Friday night was interesting for sure.",

They have a yummy cheeseburger pizza, spicy peanut pizza and my favorite Alfredo pizza. In addition to pizza they have pastas, salad bar and a dessert bar. The drink station is pretty cool they have coffee brewing all day and hot chocolate for the kids. They just opened so expect some glitches here and there but over all the key component \"SERVICE\" was a plus and that surpasses the opening pain. This is an all you can eat buffet and is reasonably priced. Enjoy!",

The arcade is quite big and there are lots of newer games available. There are also a few small rides too.  Addressing these things would make this a 5* review for me:  - a couple more healthy entrees. It's very Jekyll vs Hyde; pizza vs salad. Healthy options don't have to be rabbit food :)  - keep those arcade games updated! You purchased the latest machines but having them at old versions is no good!  - Very kiddy orientated. Adults need some fun too :)  Anyway, sort these out and I'll adjust my review! Thanks!",

If you could just include the soda price with the buffet price it would stream line your bottom line and profits. Doesn't make sense to eat with drinks. VIP program could use more work.   it would be nice if you hired some adults rather than people who appear to be in their teens. I understand it is a minimum wage job so you will get a lot of teen. But balance out the credibility of the staff by hiring some adults. You will see the difference.  Dishwashing could use a lot of work. I am tempted to bring my own cutlery and dishware because I've picked up \"clean dishes\" that still had food residue. Yikes!  The trend with this business on yelp is that the \"owner\" will only respond if the review is good 4/5 stars. I've been reading pages and pages of reviews here and wonder why you do not respond to the lower rated reviews publicly.  Maybe you do send an email or whatever it is.",

As I do not know how much it cost since I was not allowed to pay, I would assume between 11-14 per adult.   The buffet style pizza,pasta, wings and salad was way above average for a kid style entertainment eatery.  When I walked in I excepted cardboard pizza but I received real pizza with flavor.   The Game Center in my opinion could been a bit more up to date.   Seemed to have minimal games for about of ppl.  The ticket to fame ratio was average and yes toy prices where below their competitors.   Over all this is a good place to bring your kids for a night out.    My only issue with this place is the area it is located in.  I did see a lot of unruly people walking around outside.",

It was a little tight with the long table right in the middle of the room while the kids ran around you. Definitely a tight fit. Would have been better if they put the table on one side so the kids can do what kids do on the other side.  The buffet looked ok. Carb overload with different varieties of pizza, pasta and sauces, baked potato, 2 kinds of soup(potato and chicken pot pie today), fried chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy, a salad bar, a dessert area, soft ice cream machines, soda machines, etc.  The chicken pot pie soup was VERY salty. I used it as a dipping sauce for the flavorless fried chicken. Tried a slice of jalapeno pepperoni pizza and it wasn't bad. The pasta didn't look appealing so I stayed away. I did like the salad bar though.  Donuts are fried on site. It got me super excited. Unfortunately, it wasn't very good. Very greasy.   It takes a while for some items to be replenished but everyone was nice and helpful.   By 3pm, the place was packed. People crowding the buffet, piling their plates high with pizza, pasta and chicken, one of the ice cream machines was filthy, food on the floor. It was pandemonium! I felt terrible for the staff who were constantly cleaning spills.  All in all, the kids had fun. It was an ok experience for the adults. We were all glad to get out of there when we did.   If you decide to come on a weekend, I suggest coming early to beat the crowd.",

I never thought this was buffet style... Salad bar is okay, pasta selection and sauces suck. Chicken had no taste... pizza selection poor with very little ingredients on them... Dessert sucks as well ... I will not be back !!!",

    "text": "Wow. What a shame. This place has gone down hill bad. We loved our first experience so we decided to take our kids again for my sons sixth birthday. It was a Monday night so we figured it would be slow which would be nice. We spent over 150.00 for dinner, games and rides. The rides and games were fun but the food was AWFUL. Like, disgusting, gross, they should be embarrassed and ashamed awful. There wasn't any food on the buffet. We had to ask for everything! After we ate what little we could scrape up to eat, we played some games and rode rides which the kids loved. We really wanted dessert but guess what... no dessert. What was on the line looked disgusting and we didn't want to eat it. We smelt cinnamon rolls but by the time we got over there, they were gone. We waited for another batch to come out which took over 1/2 an hour and basically had to fight the other people over the eight cinnamon rolls they put out! So we think maybe if we play more games, they will put more out. I came back about 30 minutes later and still nothing but I could see a pan cooking. I took my spot next to the plate and was going to wait so I could snatch them up. I waited and waited and waited. The chick behind the counter was basically hiding in the back by the ovens and never did come out to ask me if I needed any help. I was shocked. Here I am standing there, clearly needing something and was completely ignored. I then saw a man walking who looked like a manager so I figured he would stop...:nope. Didn't even acknowledge me. I finally approached him and asked about the cinnamon rolls. I explained that we had been waiting for almost an hour and had paid a lot of money to be there that night and what could he do. The manager explained that it was a slow night but that doesn't explain the poor service or bad food. That should make the food awesome...not a lot of customers means they can keep the line stocked, right. Apparently not. We have company coming in to town for spring break and talked about going before this night happened but we won't be doing that. I would be embarrassed to take people here and have them waste their money like we did.",

The rides are timed to go when the food is served. So if you wanna eat you miss the rides and if you wanna ride you miss the food. This is a brilliant business model.

Each person pays for the AYCE buffet. Can't get in without paying that. Then you have to buy a \"Fun card\" to play games and ride on the rides. The arcade portion of five a 5 but nothing else. What is included in the AYCE price? Hmmm.....soda! I say this because everything was empty, each and every time we went to the buffet lines. No pizzas, no desserts, no chicken, pasta and salad. You'd think that you give them a few mins and it'll be refilled. Nope! The first time I came was a weekend. Okay, they were packed. I can see why there was never food available. Second time, we came on a Tuesday. Yes, Tuesday! Place was empty! Maybe total of 30-40 people which included our party of 25 lol   On top of that, they only had once cashier! ONE! Didn't have one for general admission and one for the party line. They had ONE for both lines. So, what's the point of going through the party line?  Don't waste your time and money here people!",

The salad bar was empty (no one refilled it), they kept running out of chicken, the pasta station looked very dry and the ice cream station was so dirty. Soda spilled everywhere. We kept asking when more food would be refilled. They kept saying 15 mins. It took 35 mins. Food has no flavor. And we payed$75 for a family of 7. 2 adults, 5 kids. Even my kids have decided we will no longer go there. Not worth it! Disappointed.",

The cheese for the Mac and cheese had a layer of dried cheese on top of it. The baked potatoes were wrinkled from the inside and outside. I asked the lady behind the counter for ketchup but she stated they didn't have any. I asked about the refill for the fried chicken and she was working on it. We were there for 2 hours and now fried chicken. The fried potatoes were burnt. They only had 3 kinds of pizzas out that were available.

The workers are messy and always talking to each other. My tables where I ate with my kids were dirty. You can tell people don't Carry their own weight here. Most of these kids need to be let goo !! I had high expectations even for place that caters for kids.  ~ I've been to other locations and it's the same. The place doesn't take their guest seriously and the workers look like they hate their jobs and us. Does it hurt to smile ? I went to San Diego location and the girl in the prize counter was on her phone !!   ~~ this place definitely will not be open much longer I can promise you that !!   ~~ the only good thing about this place were these two young men that took care of me and my family in our dining room. Very sweet and polite. (R) and (E)   ~~ there was even employees taking naps where the guest eat !! It made me very uncomfortable. And not all the rooms are open",

    "text": "Wow where do I start! First I guess I should preface this review with the fact  that I'm not familiar with this chain at all and noticed it while we were driving by one day. The sign is very catchy! Kudos to the company for great curb appeal and selling us immediately. When I looked it up I said Wow! It looked like a glorified chuck e cheese, I was instantly sold on the idea and was looking forward to our visit.   Well today was the day for that visit, Its a Sunday, the day before MLK, I admit probably not the best day to visit but we were determined to have fun and see this place. We had no idea what we were in store for! We just spent 3 long, stressful, hot and sweaty hours there. Let's just say I am not looking forward to our next visit. I will EVENTUALLY patronize this place again but under no circumstance will I EVER GO BACK ON A WEEKEND. EVER. This place was so packed our party of 4 were all a ball of stress from the moment we walked into the doors up until the second we left. I've never left somewhere so eagerly and with such a sigh of relief.   -Buffet-  The buffet area is one big hot mess! It is situated in the middle of the hallway that connects the front entrance to the gaming area. This hallway not only includes everyone trying to get food but also everyone walking from the front area to the back. There are no lines or any sense of order to the buffet, people just cut in front of you with no regard to anyone but themselves. I am not sure if it's the location but the type of people here were very interesting. Rude and lacking basic manners! Parents who had no control of there children. Children and even some adults just pushing there way by you to grab whatever food they want. Groups who leave there strollers in the middle of the muggy dining areas so you literally have to push strollers out of the way to get to your table. The food gets turned over so fast and there are so many people grabbing food all at the same time that you stand around waiting for it to be replenished. The buffet areas were not as clean as one may want but how could the workers get them any cleaner when there are literally a hundred people shoving there way around and making a mess of things. Buffet area is CHAOTIC! It needs to be double the size and have some order to it. It's one big free for all with a bunch of rude people who lack manners.   -Games-  The gaming area is great. Huge, lots of games I've never seen before but again it is just so crowded I wondered if this was a joke and we were in Disneyland. I've actually had a more enjoyable time in the heat of the summer at Disneyland on a holiday weekend than I had at this place. Also why is it so damn hot? My whole group including my child were so clammy and uncomfortable. Again, children running wild everywhere. I can't even guess as to how many little kids were unsupervised. While my daughter was playing games we would have random kids come up and stand next to her and just want to take over the game she was playing. Again, parents missing. This happened too many times to count.   The plastic cards that stores your credits for the games/rides were not very easy to use. You literally have to scan it 2-5 times on each game before it recognizes. Do you know how frustrating that is? To have to slide your card that many times to get it to recognize, was at my wits end.   Had a unique experience at the bumper cars waiting in line, again a group of young unsupervised kids who just cut in front of us in line. One of their mothers who eventually came up to the front only to yell at the ride operator about how her child was tall enough to ride. \"That the operator didn't measure him right, she was a nurse and she knows how to measure someone\" wtf! Mind you, I am giving you the non graphic, non ghetto version of what was said.   After all of this we had enough, grabbed our 450 credit pez dispenser from the prize area and beelined for the front exit. On our way out the breeze coming into the front doors was so refreshing that we were happy to be walking into the cold night air!   I have some questions for the operators of this place!   Why are there 4 large dining areas that can accommodate an ungodly amount of families but there is only one buffet area?  Why is it so hot and stuffy in the dining areas and gaming areas?   I want to love your place but I find it hard to get pass all of these things and I hope that it was just a bad night and not the way your place always is.",

    "text": "This place is fantastic. We have been here twice and we spend hours here on each visit. My kids are 7 and 5. On the second visit we got the VIP card for $5 to get you an extra $5 in ride/game credit every visit. I have to compare it to Chuck E cheese because of its similarities. I have to say John's has way more to offer. My son is terrified of Chuck E and jumps in my arms whether he is a rat or mouse. John's has a bear, but for some reason he is not as scary. My favorite thing is that you get a card with all of your \"tokens\" and you can also get your \"tickets\" on there to redeem prizes. I was always a germ-o-phobe when it came to using all of the coins and my kids would drop them or leave them on the rides. At John's you just swipe and go. I also used tickets to get one of the stretchy wrist bracelets and had them hole punch the players card so that I can attach it to my wrist. So easy! It is nice to have more rides and more area for older kids. There is a good variety with food including pasta's and chicken. The variety in drinks is awesome! They have hot chocolate, coffee, icee's , ice tea and all of the regular soda's as well. They also provide pizza if that is what you are looking for. Bowling, bumper cars and the ride that spins around is a house favorite.",

    "text": "To start... We decided to take our kids here on Valentine's Day! Bad choice, partly our fault as well!!! The line to get in wrapped all the way outside the entry doors, it took about 25mins to get in (I didn't even want to go in at this point, but the kids were so excited!) :( Now we're in, yeah!!! We'll sort of yeah! This place was PACKED! I am talking over capacity kind of packed! I immediately took my bigger two kids to play, while my husband stalked around for a table. We had to wait in line for every single game... Some games had make shift lines on both sides of the games;( So who goes next?! After about 40mins, I decide to go and find my husband... Lol, he finally found a table, 10mins prior to me finding him;( Now he was to scared to move because he didn't want to loose our precious table! So I went and get him some pizza... Pretty good selection! They do offer fried chicken, but let's just say that they had some fried chicken eaters in the house!!!! So I only saw the chicken on other peoples plates;( The line was too long to get any! After an exhausting 4hrs, we decided to head out, yeah! So I took my little whiners (At this point) for some dessert!!! Are you kidding me?!?! No anything left, not even a scrap!!! Clearly, somebody didn't prepare for such a big turn out, considering that it was only 5:30 when we left!  The concept is awesome and the games are too...  Bad location, iffy customers (Go, you will understand) and a little pricy for what you get! We bought the midrange game play card, but then immediately realized that it is one card and you cannot be in two places at once... 2 kids, 1 card. So basically you are stuck buying one for each child:(  I may try it again on a weekday, daytime hours and with a coupon (If they offer them.) Only because my kids thought that it was cool:)  PS. If you decide to go on a holiday like us, leave your stroller at home! Wear a carrier instead!",

Also came with 2 cards that cost $25 for 125 credits with 2 rides each. In Las Vegas there isn't much to do for kids. So when my niece and nephew came to town I was happy Johns opened up. We all had a blast and was stuffed full of food. My favorite game was the bowling. I'd say that's a stress reliever lol. Make sure you have the points loaded on the card. Return at a later time and cash them all in at once. Also love the themes of dinning rooms. Something for everyone.",

It is kinda pricey, but for a few hours entertainment what the neck why not. 3 Buffets with drinks (2 kids 1 adult) and 2 $20 fun cards cost $73. The arcade area is quite big, with a wide assortment of games. They do have some rides here as well (bumper cars, a tilt a whirl type ride, and even mini golf). Food assortment is mediocre. To be honest I was hesitant to try most of it so I just stuck to the pizza. They do have quite a variety of different varieties such as nacho, alfredo, spicy peanut butter to name a few. We didn't wait that long in line to pay, less than 10 minutes. At busy times they tell you there is a 2 hour time limit to stay in the seating/dining areas. Don't know if this gets enforced though.",

    "text": "Was excited to take the kids here because there aren't too many options besides Chucky cheese.  Let me tell you this place is so much better than CC.  It's like a Cici's pizza combined with Chucky cheese.    The food is buffet style standard fair nothing special, but ok for what it is.  There's of course pizzas, fried chicken legs, pasta, salad bar and dessert.  None of which were great just ok.  I do like how everything was setup. You pay at the door then find a place to sit, which there are 5 different rooms for seating.  The prices are $10.99 for adults + $1.99 for beverages and kids are $4.99 age 3-6 and $6.99 age 7-12.   The game room had a carousel ride, miniature golf, a boat swing ride, bumper cars and a kids bowling alley.  There was also a play area for toddlers.  The kids loved the rides and games.  The venue was clean and new.  Employees were nice and courteous.  You can definitely spend the better part of the day here with the kids and they will love it.    Couple things I want to point out that I hope they remedy soon is the men's restroom had soap, but no paper towels and the family restroom had a hand dryer, but no soap.  Overall I would definitely recommend this place for kids of all ages.  I will definitely be back!",

The bathrooms were disgusting with trash every where I don't even want to use them . The ice cream machine filled with cones that people didn't want cups everywhere full of soda next to the machine . It Was just a mess everywhere. They constantly run out of food I know the place was busy but it's suppose to be a buffet but you had to keep on waiting and waiting to bring more food . They really need to get more staff for the amount of volume they have . The only plus size is the games are not expensive and they have quite a few games to choose from . The kids had lots of fun and even with it being so busy you didn't feel crowded like when you go to chuck e cheese .",

I've been to several John's pizza in California but nevada has poor customer service and cleaningless establishment.  Let me start with entry they had a huge line and only 1 girl working who was new and didn't know how to run the front by herself while the other 2 ladies in the side office were talking about what they were doing this weekend! Second : the food area was a disgrace all you can eat buffet yeah right the salad bar was half empty no spinach no garbanzo beans no ranch no carrots etc then the pizza station everything said will make on special request their was only four different pizzas out. The brocolli cheddar sauce looked so old then I took a picture of the floor behind it and their was all kinds of good on the floor. They only had 1 person working all 3 stations clearly understaffed or poorly managed. Then off to the gsmes they have the candy crush game and I won the jackpot and the game froze called customer service over and he seen it and said wow congratulations but I can only give you your credits back sry and I was like that's not fair and he said that was the rules but to top it off this place offers bday parties and etc and when I ask for matches or something to light the bday cake with the manager told me I'm sorry it's against the rules to light anything in the building. Freaking ridiculous. This place should be shut down or should invest a little bit more money and hire people who want  to work their. It's sad   ***update*** The manager did call me and make it right so I'm very optimistic about returning their in the future.",

There was barely any food out and when I asked one of the staff members were they gonna make more food she told me no, I asked why and she said because it takes 30 minutes to prep and did I want to wait... The manager did go back there to make the food when I complained, They should always make food  it's a buffet no one should have to wait 30 minutes for food. The pizza was nasty and old I will not be going back. That's my 3 time going now and I always have a problem and it seems to get worse. I'm from California they need more training...

    "text": "The best parts of Cici's, Chuck E Cheese, and every Indoor Playground, rolled into one!  I was super impressed with this place. Reasonable price, all you can eat and drink, and plenty of games and a few rides!  FOOD All you can eat fried chicken, need I say more? Ok, well also fun pizzas constantly being served like Thai pizza, Chicken Quesadilla, BBQ, and others. They even had fresh made donuts, cinnamon buns, and a solid salad bar with rare toppings like garbanzo and beets (and everything in between). Oh yeah, and the bread sticks were amazing!  GAMES I love the e-ticket system. Unlike other arcades that spit out paper tickets, which you then have to hold onto, and have counted, this place tracks them all electronically. Swipe your play card, and forget it. It basically becomes a rewards credit card, which is really convenient. They even have cool little bonus is like a dance party that brings out with their mascot, then throws out free tickets at the end. And when you redeem your tickets, it seems like they round up whatever remainder you have at the end, to make sure you get to use every last one.  FINAL THOUGHTS I was also impressed at how big this place was. I never had to wait for food, or games, or drinks, or anything else. The only thing I had to wait for was parking, because it was so busy, but that's a good thing. It's good because it means this place is doing well and will be with us for a long time, And I for one am glad!",

Not much has changed in my behavior full disclosure. I had never heard of this place until my niece had a birthday party here. As soon as I walked in, I felt overwhelmed by all the kids and neon lights of where food stations were located. I enjoyed the set up of the salad, pizza/pasta/chicken, and dessert stations. The staff attempted to keep the stations clean, but with kids ranging from crawling to knee kicking that was an impossible mission. The food was edible, and I didn't get sick so that is where star 1 came into play. Star 2 alcohol. Star 3 digital tickets- no longer do I have save a bunch of paper tickets that I will probably lose or trash in a few months.  The games are \"doodle jump\" or \"candy crush\" and many more that are similar equals silly because you have that on your phone. The place did have activities, such as: in door golf, bowling, bumper cars, etc. The place lost stars because of price and the fact that it takes a minimum of 1000 tickets to get anything fun.  Overall, I liked my experience, and I had fun celebrating the birth of my niece.",

Salad, Pizza, and other pasta dishes are served buffet style just like CiCi's. The chicken Alfredo pizza was good. The barbecue pizza, little heavy on the sauce. I went back for seconds in regard to salad. One slice of pepperoni was a bit extra greasy.  There is an amusement side to things. Plenty of games and tickets to be won, Chuck E. Cheese style. There are also rides, a tilt-a-whirl style ride that takes you counter clockwise for a good minute and a half. A bumper car style ride. (FUN!) A 9 hole mini golf course. Mini- (Duck Pin Style) Bowling. The lane I was using for the mini-bowling game had trouble resetting the pins. I had to walk over to the prize counter to get it reset. Kind of an inconvenience. A person dressed in a mascot / bear costume came out to make an appearance. I heard no announcement or anything. Just came out of nowhere.  The food is okay at best. The kids had fun in the amusement center. Service however did not impress. The staff seemed to be just running through the motions. No one seemed to be motivated.  Like I said at the beginning of this review, my nine year old daughter returned from camp today at 10:00am and she wanted a buffet for lunch.  What she got was John's Incredible (but not so motivating) Pizza Company.",

The place is well organized, and if you can read, everything makes sense. If you can't read, they have that covered too. When you arrive at the cashier, you are asked if this is your first visit. There are six themed dining rooms for you to choose from. Food was good reasonable quality. Some items were not readily available but the signs right in front of you said items were available upon request. Food and games are separated and are supposed to stay that way.

Then I went two other times on a school night, the buffet line was clean and stocked with fresh food.I guess they can only handle slow nights, went on Tuesdays. Tonight was deja vu, a repeat experience of my first visit. A dirty empty food line for over twenty minutes.  I spoke with the manager he blamed it on a big party that just came through and being under staffed. HIRE more people. It is managements job to schedule their employees to meet the demands of business. This establishment can not handle busy peak periods.  Obviously this is something management needs to work on, maybe paying attention to the Clark County School district school year calendar might help. I will not be going back. I would not mind spending money for a fully stocked and clean buffet line.I will not be taking my daughter again. I'll take her to Game Work's, maybe Dave & Busters.",

There was a long line and we couldn't see what was up ahead. Once we got in it was so loud we could barely hear what the employee was trying to tell us. Basically they charge anyone over 3 for the buffet. They tried to sell us tickets with game credits included which I'm so glad we didn't buy because the party mom had bought game credits for us already. You'd think since we were checking in for that party the employee would know that and not try to upsell us. Thank baby Jesus we had a private room to eat in because there is a 100% guarantee you will lose your child in this place. It was SO CROWDED. They do sell beer and wine which was one plus. But if you aren't hungry you are spending a lot of money for a buffet you aren't using. There was a lot of food to choose from. You get the party room for 2 hours and there was someone making balloon animals. However it was over an hour before they brought the cards to use for the games that the party mom had purchased and she was very angry. Once we got to the floor to play the games a lot were broken and a lot seemed to just take your money and spit out tickets but had no real point. If you don't have a party room you have to brave the jungle to try to find a place to sit and eat. The employees were very nice, but didn't seem to always know what was going on.",

It is very on organized, and unsanitary. People are Grab and slices of pizza from the buffet and there's no lines, the drink area had Slurpee's mountain high because no one was polite enough to turn off the Slurpee machine so they let it go. So there was Slurpee all over the place. The employees were doing nothing but talking to other employees. Our table had dishes stacked high, there was no trashes or any place we can put our dishes and no one came around to grab them. And then the worst thing yet, is that someone stole my friends daughters phone!! And do you think employees were helpful?? Absolutely not! \"Just write your phone number here and will call you\" no trying to help anyone look for the phone whatsoever, and we told them where we left it. I recommend that nobody will ever go here, not only will your things be missing, but your food will suck and people are rude and will push you out of line, and it's in a horrible area, I was afraid that if I said excuse me I would've gotten stabbed or shot. Very ghetto. No one should ever go here. Specially bring in their child, they will get robbed mugged and stolen from inside this place!",

I think it was $7.99 for adults and depending on how old the child was 0-6 it was $4.99. So admission and 75 game credits came out to $30 which wasn't bad. The buffet was ok, it was mostly full. But when they ran out of things it took a while to fill it back up unless you specifically requested the item to be put back onto the buffet. I had a few interactions with the staff. They were fairly pleasant and professional. Except when I told one of the managers the machine did not give my daughter any tickets, her line of questions led me to believe she thought I was lying. Other than that it was a fun time and a cool place with a variety of games. I would go back. But looking at the reviews weekdays are probably the best best, less crowded = more food readily available on the buffet and cheaper pricing.",

Even if you don't want the buffet you have to pay anyway so reason number 1 why other game places are better. You must also pay for a drink and credits and rides if you want to do the rides.  Go to the buffet and it's basically like Chuck E. Cheese without the pizza right there.  So you get a salad section, semi healthy, pizza, and desserts section.  Reason 2 we got there 30 mins after opening and the food didn't look so good.  The chicken didn't look good at all. Reason 3 they have 2 ice cream machines and one wasn't working and the other you could only get vanilla. So I paid for the buffet but everything isn't up to par. Ok!  The games are same like everywhere else. The bowing lanes don't work correctly. After your kids have spent all your money the prize section isn't all that. Needless to say I won't be going back or going back anytime soon. The price isn't worth what they have to offer.",

I took my 5 year old a couple of weeks ago on a Friday at 11am when they first opened and we had so much fun.  It was pretty empty and very clean.  I felt like we had the place to ourselves.  First we had salad and pizza at the buffet. To my surprise the salad bar was really good.  Lettuce was crisp and they had all the veggies you would expect and more.  The pizza was just okay, the slices are small and the pizza is a little doughy.  I liked the chicken alfredo and he had the pepperoni.  They also had pasta, a few other sides and fried chicken.  I would've tried the fried chicken but it looked absolutely disgusting, like some steroid genetically modified meat.  The whole time we visited the salad bar I noticed an employee near by keeping the area clean and another employee stopped by our table to clear dishes.  Now on to the fun. They had all the games you would commonly find at Grand Prix or Chuck E Cheese as well as games I never played before.  I really like how the points go on your card for redemption instead of spitting out tickets.  We played almost every game and I didn't encounter one game that was out of service.  The only annoyance was swiping the card but once an employee told me you have to swipe it real fast I had no more problems.  I didn't really care for the mini-golf or bowling.  We go bowling all the time so their little fake bowling alley was lame.  The bumper cars was so much fun and there was no waiting for any ride or game.  On the way out we had swirl ice cream.  The ice cream dispenser is too fast which causes a mess but an employee came right over when we left to clean the tray.  John's Incredible Pizza is definitely a step up from Chuck E Cheese.  For maximum enjoyment go during the week when they first open.",

    "text": "This afternoon we went to John's for the first time.  We had a fairly large party and were able to pay, find ample seating and pick a good variety of food/drinks at the kid friendly buffet (pizza, pasta, fried chicken, salad bar and desserts) fairly quickly.  The food isn't spectacular by any means but if you have toddlers, fast casual works well.  I was very impressed w/ the size and layout of the place.  They have a good variety of games geared for toddlers along w/ some that would keep a tween pretty happy.  My 3yr old loved the glow bowling, it was the perfect size for him.  The bowling requires 6 credits for 5 frames.  My cousin's 4yr old loved the glow mini-golf which requires 10 credits. Majority of the ticket awarding games require 2-3 credits to play.  They had some toddler rides that require 3 credits and some larger rides that had height requirements that require 10 credits.  The staff were quite meticulous about ensuring that each child met the height requirements, good for safety.  The prize selection was larger and better than most kid friendly arcades.  Our total came to ~$56 w/ our 10% military discount on the food/drinks (2 adult weekday buffets, 1 child buffet, 3 drinks and a $24.99 fun card yielding 125 credits and 2 free rides). We went w/ another family and spent almost 5 hours there eating & playing, my son had a blast!",

The line was a disaster and the cashiers were hurried.  We had never been there and had questions.  But, she had no time to be thorough with her answers.  And agree my request neglected to add a coupon we had for some free rides.  We paid $45 for the two of us to eat pizza and play games.  We had to ask a random employee how it all worked.  It is a buffet, you pay then sit and then go get your food.  Great, got it.  Where is the seating?  A few neat theme rooms off to the side.  Three rooms later we were able to find a table to share with another pair.  Granted it was kinds bust but not slammed by any means.  Paige helped up in the dining area.  She was great, clone her.  Then after eating off to games.  Bowling first, machine issues.  OK let someone know.  For the benefit of all, really.  Attendant called a manager, a rude and bias manager.  She could use some diversity training.  She had to be called twice and was rude both times.  At this point I'm done.  Let's kill the game credits and cash on for our prizes.  Whoa, ticket value is super low.  I'm cool not getting more junk!  My son however loves it.  All in all l, I'm pretty sure you lost us as a repeat customer.  But I will spread the word about how disappointed we were.",

They need to reduce the price of admission if the food is gone. They were so overwhelmed they weren't checking tickets for drinks so you can just get multiple cups even if you didn't pay for it. This place needs more employees, more food, and more locations.",

If you get there between 11-3pm it is lunch prices so it's only $7.99. The food is descent, especially for the lunch price. They have a variety of pizzas along with pasta, salad and desserts. Drinks are included with the buffet price, they even had an Icee machine. You only pay for drinks if you want alcoholic beverages. The arcade was big and had a great variety for all ages. I saw a lot of new games that I haven't seen anywhere else. Overall I really enjoyed it and staff was nice. There was a lot of seating available. I believe it was 5 or 6 different themed seating areas. Great for the family and ALL ages. I recommend going early, it's a better experience. By the time we left around 6 it was getting more crowded with kids.",

One was for unlimited games and the other was for unlimited rides. We ate lunch then went to try to used our card it said we had no credits. Ok so I went to the front desk and a manager fixed the problem and added the credits. So we started to play the games. We played 3 games and then our card says account locked!!! What is going on. Again I went to a manager they said I have to wait two minutes between games to be able to use it. Ok fine we did that. Then I tried using my fun card for the rides AGAIN NO CREDITS!!!!! I  went to see the manager again he added the credits. I went with my son to try and ride the twister ride they scan the card NO CREDITS!!!!!! THIRD TIME WENT TO SEE A MANGER AND ASKED FOR A REFUND!!!! What a waste of time. They only refunded the cards they didn't refund our lunch my boys wanted dessert and didn't can't a chance to... You are better going off to go to chuckebe cheese or boomers! Don't waste your time here!!! Not worth the aggravation!!!",

Now, for food wise I give it a 1 STAR! They ran out of Pizza very quick and waiting for a new tray took quite a while to come out! They also had ran out of Chicken at 8pm on a Saturday! Most busiest evening Iam sure of, but come on to say they ran out of Chicken and wont serve anymore thats pretty crazy! One last thing, parents were not supervising their kids as they were in the food area and drinks. Kids were grabbing food with their own hands and picking at the Pizza. I also witnessed a few kids taking their fingers and taking the last drop of their Icee at the Icee machine. Dessert area was pretty bad, kids as well picking at the cookies, people working at that area didnt care as they witnessed it. Ive been to the one in Bakersfield, CA as they were much more sanitary and clean. Good Luck Las Vegas Id wait a while to go to this place!",

Plus I had to pay full price for me to eat even tho I have a meal card that shows I just had surgey so 13 bucks for me to eat a small slice of pizza. Then to top it off there was no where to sit and ALL the unoccupied tables were FILTHY. Food crumbs all over the floor water and soda spilled everyehere. Have heard good things about this place and this was our first time there but I was highly disappointed. Only good thing about it was the games were reasonably priced like 2 or 3 credits per game!

I was disappointed with the buffet I have pictures showing the salad bar with almost all the containers empty not filled with salad, spaghetti all watered down, lights off like the buffet is closed, And the pizza only had three or four pizzas on the whole buffet during peak lunch hour 12:45pm, It did not look anything like the website 20+ pizzas pictured full stocked salad bar with 40+ toppings, Every time I go I ask why doesn't the buffet look like the website, managers Jason & Stewart don't know what to say? And say corporate is making us do this. Included are the pictures, It is not right misleading so sad for a company to show a website with a full stocked Buffet 20+ pizzas, For a such a expensive Buffet no wonder why there is no one eating the Buffet when you have to pay $15.00+ and there is so very little food on the buffet. When a company makes a customer upset, rips off the customer, the customer doesn't want to come back, and then spreads the word of there experience. The company will not make it and will go out of business because of bad corporate decisions. Other Buffets or so much less in price $$ and offer so much more food. It is very sad, upsetting, disappointing for Johns Pizza to show you pictures on the buffet pizza pans of what should be getting, and not receiving! I would like to post a video online to show what you get for $15.00 with Johns Pizza. I will give John not so Incredible Pizza another try coming up, this buffet is so sad and needs improving and I hope it can get better I hate to see businesses close and go out of business.  Thanks",

I had to ask for to cook a few more just to have some kind of variety for dinner service, and the 3 they had were baked potato, cheese, and vegetarian pizza. The bussing was non existent, I had to almost put my dirty dishes on another table. The pizza was sliced so thin that toppings could barely stay on it when you taking it from the buffet line. No one was working the bar area so didn't bother to buy a beverage..... pretty disappointing",

The buffet was sad looking, under stocked, ignored, and some items were borderline gross looking. Most of the items were empty, so you didn't get to have them, and some items were sitting so long that they looked so unappetizing. The dessert area and pizza area hardly had any staff working to restock and keep things fresh. The ice cream machines were broken and good luck having some pizza.. this was all on a Saturday night! The staff in the game and ride area was super nice and attentive at least. It's a shame that the rest of the experience was incredibly disappointing. I don't think we will be going back : (",

That being said this would have recieved a 5 star review if it wasn't for the food replenishment times. Food wasn't horrible but was okay decent pizza and ice cream and the selection was small. The salad bar didn't have a huge variety but wasn't as bad as the chicken. For a busy Saturday night they were very slow to replenish the chicken with lines of at least ten people, they should of had back ups standing by.         Moving on to the rides yes actually carnival full sized rides. Bumper cars, The twister, mini golf, and a small bowling alley.They are 10 credits for the bumper car and spinner, 6 for bowling, and 8 for mini golf. For that space it actually works and there are room for a few more games as well. The bumper cars was slow to ride due to about 4 cars not working and only 4 operational. The twister was great best one, the attendant working was very fun and energetic. We got our car to spin at least mock 1 haha.    Now the games were actually fun and gave quite decent tickets. It's like Dave and Busters but a few less games and geared more towards kids. The fun card works like D and B credits on the cards along with your tickets as well so don't lose your card. They have a huge claw machine that is 8 credits and gives you a big stuffed animal was a line all night for that one. Another one where you drop a big bouncy ball and try to hit the monster bonus which was over 3000 tickets by the end of the night. I hit the bonus balls to try which was 14 of them and won over 500 tickets. Everyone was trying for that monster bonus.     This place is like Chuck E. Cheese and Peter Piper pizza on steroids. The prizes are 100x better than either of them. You can even get a PS4 for a mere 60,000 tickets so you better save up. The also had an Xbox one for 36,000 ipad, ipod touch, Camera, R/C car, and a gps. To name just a few. I wish I would of taken a picture of the wall of prizes. Great stuff and for a decent amount we walked away with a total of 3,000 tickets on our card.      This is a great place to have a Birthday party. There is no time limit on when you actually have to leave the place. Besides the room you rent which was 2 hours we spent a total of 5 hours there. Being a Saturday at 6pm it wasn't really all that busy. It's more spacious than Chuck E. Cheese by far. You do have to buy buffet just to get in which is understandable being in the middle and avaible to all who are there. It's well worth the money. Like I said I was there for a birthday party and didn't spend a dime but I saw the prices. Sorry for the long post but it was a great experience. 5 stars if the replenishment was fast had to wait on multiple food items. Not sure if there short staffed or what.",

For our family of five (husband, me, a five year old, and a one year old), the bill was $69. Sometimes we get coupons via emails, so make sure you subscribe if you want discount. Our bill included buffet, 115 credits + 2 rides, and VIP card renewal.  We arrived at 7 pm, and it felt like we were late to a party lol. There were still food, but half of the trays were empty. Salad bar was sad today. Last time we came, they had chopped, hard-boiled eggs as topping. There was none this time. All salad toppings this time were straight up from cans. There were corns, pickled jalapenos, tiny ham bits, olives, and diced tomatoes.  Pasta & More bar was ok. There were Mac n cheese, pasta and tomato sauce, pot pie chowder, loaded potato chowder, whole baked potatoes, fried chicken drumsticks, roasted cauliflower and green pepper, and breadsticks. Roasted cauliflower and the loaded potato chowder were my favorites. Fried drumstick was the only meat dish, so it ran out fast.  Pizza bar was a hit for my son. There were cheese, pepperoni, chicken fajitas, jalapeno pizzas. My sons were so excited to start playing that they couldn't focus on eating. They were done after a slice each. We decided to save dessert until after the games.  The game arcade was amazing! There were many, many, many games for all ages. Shooting games, racing games, air hockey, bowling, basket ball, angry bird, etc. The kids didn't really care about redeeming points for presents as they had a great time with the games. There was a small, gated area for little ones to hang out.  Although I gave this visit three stars, we will come again. This place is like heaven for 5-7 year old kids. Pizzas and games",

It was super messy though, there was spilled ice cream melted all over the machine that had looked like it had been there for hours. The line was long, but that was due to a customer wanting to find coupons.overall, I will be back if the kids want to come for an event, but definitely not because I'm craving the pizza",

Most of the food trays were empty or dried out and they didn't refill anything except the pizza (salad bar had no salad, pasta sauces empty and dried up in the containers, etc...). We went at 6 and some of the group started eating at 7:30....they close at 9:30. If they don't plan to keep the buffet stocked after a certain time that should be posted or mentioned when you are paying. I paid for 11 people so I spent a nice amount of money.   We live in Las Vegas the buffet capital of the world. If you can't provide a great buffet stick to pizza only .  If you go for the games only you'll be good.   The manager was helpful with the game cards. We were missing tickets and he fixed that problem for us.",

    "text": "Came here for a birthday party so we had a private room. That said, my suggestion for parties is that the food should be brought to the room for the partygoers. The frustration with this place is that while it's AYCE buffet style, you literally have to stand where the food is otherwise it will be gone. I was there for the party from 4:00pm - 7:00pm on a Saturday. Myself and pretty much every member of the party had to constantly check the buffet line to see what was put out because the pans were constantly empty. Aside from that, you could clearly tell what foods have been left out for a long time. I shouldn't expect much variety from a place that caters to kids but regardless, the quality of the food was poor. The pasta sauces were way too runny, the salad was watery, the chicken pot pie (soup) and chowder just looked unappetizing after sitting in the same warmer. The best food(s) they offered, and the rest of the party agrees, was the fried chicken and mashed potatoes which is what I ultimately had seconds of because nothing else was satisfying or looked even remotely appetizing.",

The party room my cousin got was small & congested, so I think they should expand some rooms.  The place is HUGE with lots to do for toddlers, children, and even adults. (They have rides, bumper cars, mini-golf, and mini-bowling)  The buffet selection was pretty good too & quite delicious. You even see them toss out old pizza (even if it's a whole pizza) ensuring that what they're serving is fresh. Don't expect Bacchanal, but I'd say their food was WAAAAYY better than Chucke E. Cheese's & Cici's Pizza.  They even allow you stay after your party is done, and they have ample seats & tables.  The price is reasonable, and I think they even have a Groupon.  The area though, is a bit sketchy (just being real), and it's right next door to Boulevard Mall.",

They started out strong but the last time we went there we all agreed it would probably be our last.   The prizes for The tickets won weren't worth the money or effort put into getting them. The arcade was 50-50, many of the games were down or broke plus there are fighting games in their whole arcade. Just racing, shooting, and ticket games. I don't know why i let them talk me into becoming a VIP member. Hopefully one day they will improve but for now the place is good for taking young children. For an adult, your better off going to the pinball hall of fame or press start same location.",

All the climbing toys were almost black so that part I wouldn't take my toddler back in. (Point lost there) Had tons of stuff to do, my money felt like it stretched farther in their game room vs chuckie cheeses! Even my older kids enjoyed it! It was not crowded at all which was the best! The buffet was really good and they had a good rotation of fresh food coming out! It was a bit pricey but for a bday last min I will definitely choose this place again!",

Actually birthday party day was total chaos. I was told I could've been in 15 minutes before my start time so I had my guest come early just for us to be packed in the entrance  way and no workers can tell me what was going on and kept giving me the run around. How embarrassing. I had balloons and decorations with me so they asked if they could set it up in the room.. They literally kept the balloons tied up together and the decorations in the box when we got in.  The hosts were TERRIBLE! I understand that it's a new place but they definitely should've been trained more. Even with simple instructions from me, they couldn't even handle. They were too quiet and too shy and had no itinerary.   As someone who paid well over $1000 for a 2+ hour birthday party I was expecting to have a better time. I would have never done this if I knew how unprofessional it would have been. Better off going to chuck e cheese paying fraction of the price.",

    "text": "This is the weekend hangout in a once revitalized part of Las Vegas, the boulevard mall.  I heard many good things about this place and that it was great for kids, etc.  However, I just simply was not 100% impressed.  It's nothing more than an over glorified Chuck E. Cheese.  There are no choices of food and there is just one buffet section immediately when you enter and then there are dining room areas with many different themed sections.  This part I actually thought was well thought out, because there was plenty of seating for families of all sizes.  The gaming area is completely saturated by the smell of sweat, dirty socks and not enough arcade games.  I had to constantly wait in line to play a game with my 3 year old son.  Even something as simple as fish tank in a bowl average wait was 5-10 minutes.  There was just too many people and why they picked the Boulevard Mall for this venue beats me.  I'm sure it was past the legal code for how many actual people were allowed there.  It's one of the ghettoiest places I've been to in a while.  Some other little kid tried to steal my son's bday gifts and the parents weren't even around to correct them.  I won't be back.",

    "text": "Eek indeed. Somehow I thought this would be a classier version of Cici's pizza. Instead, it's like a more ghetto version of Chuck E Cheese. The place is huge with multiple huge dining rooms. We went on a holiday Monday around 4:00, and it was packed. We had to go into 3 dining rooms just to find an open table! I can't imagine how it looks on Saturday at lunch or dinner time! With all those folks wanting to eat, the kitchen needs to be CHURNING OUT some pizza! But they are not. Patrons are waiting 3 and 4 deep for the next pizza to come out to the buffet and then you have to be willing to throw elbows on some kids to get a slice. I got a salad from the salad bar, and they were out of 2 of the 4 dressings! Like completely out. I couldn't even scrape together a tablespoon or so for my sad lettuce. Same with the dessert bar. There are about 6 or 8 different desserts on the buffet, plus soft serve ice cream off to the side. Sounds pretty awesome, right? Not when literally ALL BUT ONE of the dessert stations are empty. On the plus side, they have fried chicken, and it seemed to be well stocked. The pizza is ok, when you can get it. I think it's on par with Cici's, which is about all I can possibly expect from a pizza buffet. Seeing as how there are hundreds of people moving through the buffet area, picking up drinks and foods, there are lots of spills. John's does not have the staff to deal with these spills. There are cones set up everywhere, blocking off sticky areas, which forces the foot traffic around the buffet to be even worse. Plus, it's dirty and off-putting in a restaurant. The games are ok. I appreciate that it's big and they have a couple rides in there, too, but there were very few games that younger children would enjoy and of those, seriously half were broken.  $11/adult. Glad we checked it out, but I won't be back.",

The one here in Vegas is okay. I would like it more if the staff weren't so lazy. They don't clean tables right away so when i go inside of one of the eating rooms ( few themes to choose from which is wonderful) there is a bunch of tables dirty no staff around to clean it. Then there wasn't much pizza out on a Saturday night. They are not making the pizza right away. In California the one there on there busy days they would have pizza out right away knowing they will go fast. Even when they first open up like in 2000 they were on top of things (the one in cali) but the one here they are just plain lazy staff",

We reserved the room for 20-30 people at 1-3pm on Saturday, 5/13/17- the second to the last room. The hosts seemed to be friendly at first and then being unprofessional. They kept telling us to hurry and clean up and pack our presents to leave the door by 2.45. It was 2pm and they told us to close the bill. At 2.15, we had to beg them if we can stay to open the presents and thank the guests for coming. We walked out the room at 2.35 -Our guests had to carry the plates of food and eat outside while our kids are still playing. It was so terrible. They didn't even get the kids to play games. The staff act more like busboys and bouncers at the club.  My husband and I didn't want to make a scene and were trying to entertain the guests who were very upset and annoyed by the staff.  I'm sorry, guys. Your food is very good but the service of the party room is less than one star!! Horrible!!",

To make it worse, horrible yelp reviews had me walking in here with an attitude way before i even the fun began.   We paid $17 total 4 the buffet & $20 for a preloaded fun card. Given the volume, it's quite impossible to keep the buffet items fully stocked. I think they would benefit by hiring buffet chefs who have culinary experience in keeping up with the large masses. The buffet would be so much better if the food stations had stanchions to control entry & exit. No need to pay for drinks. The cups r a free for all kinda thing.   We arrived at 1pm, ate n the Fun began. I like the huge variety of games they have. A few were out of order. $20 lasted us from 2-6pm. If we all ate & cleaned after ourselves, the place would be clean. 80% of the families left their dirty plates and cups on the table.   I like the idea of multiple dining rooms they had. Surprisingly, some of the buffet items empty at 1pm, were still empty at 6pm. I got my money's worth. My daughter and I visited the buffet 4 times. Wasn't gonna let my $17 worth so i think it was more than worth it.   The gaming technology could use a little tweaks. The fun loaded cards can only be swiped upside-down n then u tap on the screen to get credits. Yeah!  A little retarded. I feel like I double paid on some of the games b4 i figured it out. It was never explained during purchasing.   So, lose the attitude. Go there hungry, stuff up n have fun. Parking n sales lines r not that bad. U got legs? Then u can find a parking spot n walk inside.   Lastly, the bathrooms needs paper towels. I hate that bacteria spreading blower that just recycles the stinky air while u dry up.   I'll be back next time. This time, I'm skipping breakfast n wrecking a harvest at the buffet.",

We didn't have to wait long to enter, the place is really big with lots of seating in different themed rooms. There was a salad bar, pizza station, pasta station, dessert station, soda station, and a station that had a variety of foods like fried chicken, rice, and potatoes. The food was fresh and tasted decent considering what type of establishment it is. My kids enjoyed playing the games and they weren't too expensive. I guess we came at the perfect time because it wasn't a lot of kids running around and all of the employees were very helpful.  I will definately visit again, I will make sure to arrive when they first open. When we were leaving there was a long line of people coming in.",

There is a mini bowling alley, bumper cars, mini golf etc.  The arcade and ticket games are all current.  It's basically a D&B for kids.  Although a little pricey, it was worth it.

    "text": "There is nothing incredible about John's Incredible Pizza. We wanted to take our 3 year old somewhere new today so we tried out John's. The price point was higher than I expected at $12.98 for adults with a drink. I was optimistic when I saw the 4 food buffets, but that didn't last long. Pizza is the obvious staple on a pizza buffet and it was all wrong. The pizzas at John's are cut 10 times instead of the standard 5 cuts for a medium pie. What you end up with are thin micro slices that are not fun to deal with. Another mistake is that the cutter did not cut all the way through to the ends so when you dish up a slice, all of the pieces stick together which again is not fun to deal with. Every single pizza was cut that way. All of the pizzas I tried were doughy and undercooked. One bite was all I could choke down of each pizza.       I decided to try some of the soups, figuring I could fill up on something before I go. The baked potato soup was watery and broken down because it had set on the buffet too long. I moved on to the Fiesta soup and it was the exact same, watery and broken down. I thought ok, I'll try some salad bar and get my family out of this place. When I got to the salad bar, I noticed that all of the veggies were micro cut (Apparently that's a thing at John's). The tomatoes were diced too small and were breaking down into mush. The ham was the same way.       When I got back to the table my 3 year old spilled her water on the booth seat and some ice spilled on the floor. I tracked down a kid to help clean up the spill. When he came back with towel in hand he saw the ice on the floor and immediately went to get a mop instead of wiping off the booth first.  We had to stand there and wait another two minutes for him to return.       The food at John's is low quality. Be prepared to be underwhelmed if you try them out.",

Not sure if it was because it was the end of the day, or they just don't really care about the quality of the food? Example, the sweets tasted too generic. But the pizza was pretty delicious. Would have given 5 stars but the food was sort of a damper. Overall, friendly service and we have to thank Billy Lee for his professionalism and hospitality.",

    "text": "Not sure if we were completely oblivious of the chaos as children when we had the glorified opportunity to run around a place like Chuck-E-Cheese or Peter Piper Pizza while the adults cringed in horror or If this place really sucks and even a child would notice how awful it is.   We came in with friends and all of our children on a Saturday night (not the best choice on our part). We stood in a line that wrapped around the outside of the building for 45 minutes (expected). Finally got to the front and paid for our buffet, games and ride fees. The only positive thing I CAN say about this place is the prices are extremely cheap.    On to the nightmare. Upon walking in, this place is complete CHAOS. Spilled soda every where you walk, lemons on the floor, ice on the floor, RIGHT WHEN YOU WALK IN. The endless \"buffet\" we paid for, was completely empty every. Single. Time. Each time a staff member would replenish a pizza or pasta, it was literally devoured by an over crowd of guests within seconds - no exaggeration. We were able to fight our way for a couple pieces of pepperoni and cheese pizza but if you want to eat, be prepared to get pushy or its gone in a flash.   That fabulous buffet price even includes all you can drink beverages! Hot coffee, lattes, sodas and icees! Sounds great! Except every machine was either of of syrup, carbonation and Icee machines were all broken the whole time.  When we grabbed our trays and tried to find a place to sit to eat, all tables were filthy. No staff to be found. We had to wipe down our own table to sit down to eat, 6 children in tow and I'm not talking just wiping off a few crumbs..  We moved on from \"dinner\" to the games. It's for the kids after all and it was time for them to have fun. Oh. But wait. 75% of the games we had already paid for on our pre-paid, loaded game Card were OUT OF SERVICE. Now at this point, even the kids were unhappy.  Obviously, we came In on a crazy Saturday night with sugar crazed children running everywhere, it was chaos, I get that. But this place is clearly understaffed. The staff wasn't able to keep up with the large crowd of people that just kept pouring in. It was a literal nightmare.   Never again. If you have young children that are itching for a fun time, pay the extra and go to Chuck E Cheese, they've obviously been doing it for years and even they don't screw up like this.",

Cleanliness of the place still an issue, but i think that has alot to do with patrons ..kids and adults ...who I see drop food or spill drinks and dont even try to help clean or pick it up.  That is just rude! We saw numerous staff who were busy bussing tables so it isnt that they are not working. They were very nice. The place is busy.  If parents controlled their kids a but more around the buffet, i think everyone would have a better experience.  Nothing like watching another kid shove his way in front of your own child so he can get his food first. No manners.  Yes..we do plan to return next time we are in town.  Money better spent here than circus circus.",

Either not tasty or just not appealing. Love the fact they have more variety than other arcades, and like the fact it's basically adults appropriate.   Seating - 5/5. Always where to seat, cool rooms, always way too cold though.   Arcade - 4/5/5. Tons of games, for little ones and for older kids. Bowling, Mini golf, racing cars. I came in with my 5.5 and 1.5 and they had a blast. I will say that at the weekends or busy days this place is much less recommended. Our first time coming in was when it opened. Tons of people, huge lines and it just wasn't fun in general. But we did come in couple of other times and it was great.",

    "text": "My wife and I went to John's to see if it was a good place for our son's 1st birthday; obviously the type of place that is geared to an older child, but we figured we'd get dinner out of it at least. What we didn't know was that we would experience the worst buffet of our lives.  We arrived at about 4:30 PM on 06/20/19, and there is a huge colorful sign that advertises $9.99 dinner buffets outside; we went inside and at the counter, we were told they only do that if you use a coupon from their website, and we would have to do it separately. So we each grabbed our phones and searched for the website; I was not able to use it at all, and my wife was able to select the coupon screen, but it didn't work correctly. After nearly 10 minutes of waiting, we gave up and just ordered it at the regular price of $12.49. The cashier was kind enough to give it to us at the senior discount of $11.49, and off we went.   I wish I could tell you that was the worst thing about the experience. Now, there is an old adage about not eating in empty restaurants, but considering this is a family party place midweek, I gave it some slack. but it was really empty, maybe 3 or 4 other families in total; they have multiple themed rooms so I can't say for sure, but the room we were in was mostly empty. It was also incredibly noisy; they were blaring ESPN at a sound loud enough to warp wood. My wife and were 2 feet apart and could not hear each other without yelling. I would have asked some staff to help, but there was never anyone around. We waited to see if anyone would collect our used plates, but no one did. (We later saw on the ad attached to our receipt that they clean the tables after you leave)  So if the pricing and the loneliness (the place is really big) and the noise and the scant employees were not enough, the food will be. It was an incredibly bland, uninspired, sad excuse for a buffet. From pizza with tasteless crust to bland noodles with a watery cheese sauce, everything there looked like it was placed with no care for how it looked or tasted. The baked potato was the best part of the meal, with freshly shredded cheddar. The desserts were the worst part; small isolated trays of cake or brownies that looked old and hard, a cobbler my wife said was terrible (I had already lost my appetite), and a broken soft serve machine (I later saw one was working, on the other side). I glanced at the salad bar but it had the same general sense of \"whatever\" that the rest of the food had, so I passed.  Now, you might say I expect too much, that this is just a kid's place to eat pizza fast and get back to the fun. While that is True, they charge the adults $12.49 a dinner plus $2 for the soda, so if you do plan on bringing your kids here to play, I'd suggest you eat somewhere else first. Anywhere else.   Suffice to say I will not be having a party here. I hope someone from the restaurant sees this and some of the other reviews and thinks about some changes.",

    "text": "This was our first and last experience here. We decided to take our daughter here for her last day of summer before she starts school and i had coupon so it worked our perfect.  Upon entering you have several dining rooms, a beverage station, a mini bar as well as the buffet (Salad bar, pasta & more, pizza and desserts) the back area consists of the arcade, rides and prize area.  Our appetites weren't fully there just yet so we decided to play some games first. Everything is pretty reasonably priced between 2 and 4 besides the rides, mini golf and bowling which are more. But if you have ride tickets there is no need to use credits on those which our between 8-10. Games selection are good, mini golf was a 8 or 9 hole which was not too long and perfect. Bowling game is pretty short with only 5 frames. They have bumper cars, spinning wheel and the boat ride. The 2 stars is pretty much for the arcade only.  Now lets get to the food. I have to be honest and say that passing the buffet area as we were walking in, we scanned over and thought okay nothing special but at least there's pizza if push comes to shove. This food was horrible from start to finish. The salad station was decent with the fixings but kind of hard to enjoy with the 2 choices of lettuce being wilted and water logged while sitting on the line. 1 star. Pasta and more had soups, pasta, baked potato, chicken and some side items like mash, corn, etc. The only decent item here was the fried chicken ONLY not even the pasta was worth taking a look at. 1 star. Pizza area was decent with many choosings but taste wise mediocre 1 star and dessert station will get 2 stars because of the fresh mini donuts getting fried on the line and soft serve station.   I'm not sure how this place even runs the way it does and still stays open. The buffet line isn't fresh, the beverage station cups sit in the same rack that they run through the dish washer with. Gross.   After this experience we would only be back to play games and ride rides but seeing as you need to pay an admission as well as pay for food that'll be a no for us. Don't waste your time with this place. Dave and busters or even chuck e cheese a better choice!",

    "text": "\"Incredible...\" yes Incredibly TERRIBLE! I actually see a good review that was posted today and I'm like.. we're we at the same place! This is my second time here and I have to say the first time was pretty good actually.. But today was seriously maybe the worst meal I ever had out at a restaurant! I should also say this was 5pm on Sunday!   Salad bar-- limited options to begin with, and one side completely closed. Only boring iceberg lettuce to choose, and I'll excuse that, it's a kids place, I wasn't expecting arugula. But the cucumbers looked like they had been cut and sitting in the fridge for 2 weeks! The ranch was so watery it wouldn't even stay on the lettuce.   Hot food bar- over half of the items there were little to none left of and when asked when they would be replenished, I was told 30mins!! WTH at buffet? On a Sunday eve? At a kids place??! When the fried chicken FINALLY came out, there isn't enough salt in LV to make it have flavor! My 1yr old literally spit her first bite across the table and handed the rest back to me!   On to the pizza /pasta bar- pizza options to choose from were ok. But there are all these flavors posted and it says something like \"available upon request.\" So there was a label for Thai chicken pizza, I asked for it, and shockingly was told, oh I'm sorry we don't have the chicken for that. OK.. so my 5yr old wanted pasta with marinara sauce, shouldn't be a stretch at kids pizza joint? Once again, it'll be 30 mins! Now I get things run out, but this place was not that busy, and 30mins! Seriously I highly doubt there's a chef in the back crushing tomatoes and roasting garlic.. so WTH is going to take 30mins exactly.   On to the dessert bar- of course one of the soft serve machines was \"out of order\" at least the other was working but the sorry excuses for cheesecake bars etc looked less appetizing than hospital food! I will say the mini donuts were very good and freshly made. Of course when we went back for round two of the soft serve (since that's pretty much all we ate for dinner) surprisingly (not) was \"out of order.\"   Drinks- 2 out the 3 ice machines had no ice. The ice tea was brown water and had no taste.   Bathroom- severely under serviced, no soap in the soap dispensers. A horrible smell, and yes I get it's a bathroom but the stench was like dirty mop mixed with poop. BARF!   The game area was fine but nothing spectacular.   The place is crawling with \"employees\" but most of them standing around biting their nails (literally) and when you dare ask them for something they act put out.   I'm sorry John but you are WAY less than incredible and I won't be back.. and to think when we walked in my 5yr old thought she might wanna host her 6th bday here...",

The drink station is stocked with coke and hot cocoa, even slurpee's.  The different types of fun one can into here is unbelievable all under one roof.

It's a lot more confusing to learn how to load the cards here and to get the best bang for my buck especially with my coupons .. Admittedly I do not always plan my visits so keep in mind they do have deals but paying attention to their website will help with that ..  Today after a visit for the mall that this place is next to attending another attraction they ran out of pizza and I decided to let my son have a chance to come here ... I have another daughter who is 11 so we always opt to get two fun cards and we joined VIP but I always forget ... the cashier we got was Ibrahim and he's super sweet but shy and wasn't sure the best route to help me get the most bang for my buck when I saw my total got to $86 when he consulted Billy one of the managers he simplified the process with a smile and made sure I got my $10 off a $100 like the email I got in the easiest most value friendly way without making me feel dumb or upset for spending $90 .. honestly for all you can eat even at places with about the same level food my kids get to have fun and play .  Depending on your kids there may be other options that are better but for mine ages 8 and 11 this option beats competitors close by because my son isn't old enough to do a lot of the adrenaline stuff and that isn't my daughters thing ..  Listen I'm giving this place 5 stars for an all you can eat gaming experience for adults and kids to be able to enjoy without breaking the bank or causing tears of upset for not being big enough or boredom for not having fun ..  Sometimes I've been and I have wondered why the food and the mess isn't taken care of but as I was reminded today management here wants to help so if you're friendly and ask ..  Managers like Billy will take care of you ...",

The rest of the place smells like parmesan cheese, stuffed in the dirtiest gym socks you've ever smelt.  From the minute you walk in this place, the only word that comes to mind is DISGUSTING!!  As a local, and a human being, this is the worst place to waste your hard-earned money in the entire city!!",

It takes about two hours for me and my family to spend the $20. The tickets are digital so you don't have to worry about losing them. This place is fun for the whole family. I really love it. The buffet is really good too. They have a variety of food and a variety of beverages they offer. I really hope to come back here soon.",

Had to wait 45 min for fried chicken and when it came out, chicken was still undercooked. They had staff standing around in the front cashier stations while the kitchen was short and had no food going out. We called the manager and she tried to help. Kitchen cook gave attitude and said that most of the staff were on break that's why she was getting backed up trying to food out. We also had to wait 15 min to get a attendant for the rides. Never will go back again.",

    "text": "I've been to John's Incredible Pizza Company in California so my expectations were high.   -The first time I came here was for my God son's 6th birthday party. My family rented a private room. To be honest, it was just okay. For the price they paid, there was nothing special for the kids and the experience wasn't great.   -The second time I came was for lunch. It was so dirty and messy everywhere. The salad bar was empty (no one refilled it), they kept running out of chicken, the pasta station looked very dry and the ice cream station was so dirty.   -The third time I came, I decided to celebrate my 35th birthday here since I'm a VIP card holder and I got a free dinner for my birthday. It was about 40 of us. I didn't rent a private room since I didn't see the value in it. I went 1 hour early and just blocked off an area. It was a Thursday night so it was pretty dead anyways. I had a blast for my birthday. Downside to things is I had to ask the staff to come and clean our area too many times, the food area wasn't stocked, and I did notice they made the game area smaller than before.   Tips: -Order your pizza fresh -Take a tray of food cause the walk from your table to the food is pretty far  Here's the prices: Adults 13 and older: $11.49 Seniors 55 and older: $10.49 Kids 2 and under: Free with paying adult Kids 3 to 6: $5.29 Kids 7 to 12: $7.29  Enjoy.",

John's has more food options and better games, even rides, bowling and mini golf.  Food is not great.  They have soup, salad, pasta, pizza, bread sticks, chicken, desserts.  Lots of options at least.  There's a bar that serves beer, wine and margaritas which you might need after being here for awhile.  Every time we have been it has been busy, like a madhouse.  Dirty tables everywhere.  I think the clientele is a big part of the problem here which John's can't really control.  Kid running around putting hands in the food, acting wild.  Many of the adults not much better, making a mess, not caring.  It's unfortunate because really that is what keeps us away.  Prices aren't bad and the kids love the rides and games.",

We waited awhile after pressing the button for the attendant to work the ride. When she got to us, she was very polite. There are many different areas to sit at, each having its own theme. There are lots of games each costing 2- 8 tickets each.",

So you are stuck eating overpriced buffet food, if you are lucky to get any, just to play the games and rides. We came here at 6:00pm, normal dinner time, and the buffet had hardly any food. I counted 4 large parties and everyone was scrounging the buffet like vultures just to get a piece of something.   Management needs to do a better job at enhancing the quality of food and prepare better during the dinner service.",

It was so messy and sloppy looking that I could not bring myself to have any and niether could my nephews girlfriend.

    "text": "Lets rename this place JOHN'S INCREDIBLY DIRTY AND DISGUSTING PIZZA COMPANY!  I would give this place -10 if I could.  First of all, i was charged for drinks that I DID NOT PURCHASE nor did I want to purchase!  When I tried to speak to the cashier after it happened, she ignored me. Then when I asked for a manager from a different employee, the manager never came.  Nearly 2 hours in to our visit we ask for a manager again, and finally once comes to the dining area where we were seated. Low and behold the \"Manager\" who identified herself as Tamara (which was likely a fake name - since our receipt said AMBER on it) That is ok though, because I have her on video stating her name and have an account of her rudeness. She was in fact our cashier.  The first thing I asked her is WHY she charged me for drinks that I didn't want? Me and my children DO NOT drink soda or carbonated beverages, which is all they offer, besides coffee (but even the coffee machine wasn't working)! She said they always charges for drinks and if you don't want them they will take it off the bill. HELLO I NEVER ASKED FOR A DRINK, DO NOT CHARGE ME FOR SOMETHING I DID NOT SPECIFICALLY ASK FOR. She got rude and offered a refund but said we would have to leave after we got the refund because the buffet was the price of admission and we can't stay if we aren't eating, however I bought play cards for all my kids! Eating an playing are TWO DIFFERENT THINGS!!! I asked her if she would eat any of the food I had on the table, she refused to answer me.  The rice was hard and dried up, mashed potato's had a hard crust on them from sitting.  The yellow corn was literally BROWN and clearly left over from the day before and semi-reheated and put on on the buffet for opening today. So lets move on to the food:  the food on the buffet when they opened was DAY OLD, STALE food!  There was one piece of chicken I took off the buffet solely so I could take a picture of it that literally looked like someone took a bite out of it  then threw it back in the pan! For the entire 2+ hours we were there, the buffet was dirty and most of the food remained old and not replenished.  Corn (yellow corn) was BROWN and shriveled, clearly day old and put back out on the buffet in the morning.  I took LOTS of pictures of how dirty the place was, it was insane!  If what i saw was on the buffet, i can only imagine how bad the kitchen was.  Definitely  someplace the health department needs to keep their eye on!  Literally the corn bread was as hard and stale as a brick, no lie! all of the pasta was dried out, literally dried out and hard, the \"sauces\" they had available had a film over the top of them and were luke warm at best, not even steaming, not hot at all. Some of the sauces had other sauce dripped into them and some actually had crust on the top of them. The soups were old and crusted over as well, and NOT HOT.  Clearly left over from the previous day or days ago!  The nearly non-existent desserts were as stale as everything else. OH and don't get me started on how disgustingly dirty the ice milk machine was! OH holy mold batman, it was so gross it appeared it hadn't been cleaned in weeks, if not months! AND if that wasn't enough there were young teenage employees all around, none of which were doing much just standing around.  In the play area, there was ONE adult working!  Seriously, one adult who had to work 3 of the large rides AND the Prize Area!  Needless to say many unhappy guests! OH and one poor older lady who only spoke spanish and was clearly upset with her service as well could not find anyone to help her.  We tried to help her but we could not speak spanish so we were unable to help her.  When we got home, we called Corporate, they could care less about the rotten dried out food and the overcharges.  We will be taking the pictures and video not only to the Clark County Health Department but also to all four local news stations, and every social media outlet available to spread the word!  Save your money, there are better buffets and better places to take your children for lunch/dinner and fun in this town.  This place was beyond horrific and EVERY SINGLE EMPLOYEE working there needs to be FIRED! No one take pride in their workplace. But that is what you get for minimum wage paying jobs I guess.  GET NEW MANAGEMENT but at the very least hopefully the health department will shut it down ASAP after seeing the video and photographic pics from today!",

We purchased the three fun play cards of $24.99 that gets you over 100 play credits+ 2rides per card. Not bad pricing. I love how they have five separate dining areas. We sat in the kaleidoscope and it had lots of Disney tv for the kids to watch. The food quality is poor. I would rate it a 2/10. I only really liked the chicken & rice, fried chicken, and salad bar was somewhat decent. They have icees! : white cherry flavor is the best. The pizza was doughy(inedible), the dessert did not taste good: the flavor and freshness was unsatisfactory.   The play area was fun for the kids. They had plenty for the kids entertainment. We were there for a total of three hours. I think they should spend more money and time trying to improve their food quality. If they did I may rate them higher than three stars.",

    "text": "I think this place is awesome as far as the following: - The staff is amazing and are super positive and helpful. - The games are super legit I would put them ahead of Dave and Busters and Chuck e Cheese as far as value and wow factor. Although Dave and Busters has a bigger selection, I believe the games are overpriced there versus here where your kids can play longer with the same amount of money. I believe Chuck E Cheese games are a little bit cheaper but are nowhere near as fun as Johns Incredible Pizza. As an adult I am literally playing 80% of these games right along with my kids.  I have been here twice and was really impressed with the selection and having the ability to put tickets on cards versus hard tickets.  - Cleanliness is pretty good they have a buffet that seems to be more tailored to kids. They do a good job of having staff clean up the area and the bathrooms were impressive.   Things that can be better- I like what they are doing but I think to bring in more customers they may need to revise price points for entry and things of that nature. I would recommend if members want to just come play games that they have an option with a reduced entry or something of that nature. Although I said I liked a lot of things the buffet was not one of them. I do not feel it was worth the price, as some of the items could have been restocked better and that was an observation from both times. If the buffet is a keeper than put some work into making it better. After leaving the second time I was still wowed with the concept of the place overall but  I cant imagine coming back if I have no intention of eating at the buffet. This is coming from a customer that really likes this place and I am still saying that.Paying for the buffet for me was an  absolute waste of money the second time and if I wasn't trying to show my significant other how cool the games were I would have opted not to go in at all. None of this is meant as a slight to the company. I think they are doing big things and have something special that may need some tweaks to take it to the next level.   So BLUF (Bottom line up front)  Games 5 stars/buffet 2 stars. I'm giving it a 3. This is just my opinion which does not mean much. Your kids will still have a ball here and they will be ok with the buffet more than likely.",

We only had the ice cream. It was good. :-) The kids can play in the connected Indoor Amusement Center. There are rides, games, arcades, and a miniature glow golf section. We took our 2.5 year old and spent several hours here. He had a lot of fun.  Note: Very crowded on the weekends so keep a close eye on your kids.

First, the terms of the groupon was not clear and I was a bit confused with the limited unlimited play. Then, when we sat down the area was FILTHY, stains on the seats and floors. There was a sickening smell liking vomit/sour/musty. Then the air felt thick and sticky. This place looks like it needs a deep cleaning! The food areas are not what they used to be. The salad area was not attended to and it was hardly appealing. The pizza area got a little more attention as they were refilled regularly. The employees couldnt be bothered as they mostly hung out in the back of house. The pasta sauces and other items were dry and unappetizing. The dessert bar was skimpy and BOTH soft serve machines were down.  I am so disappointed because, this place was a god sent to people in Vegas with kids since there is very little to do. We left JIP with a few germs that day as it was truly disgusting. The family restroom was okay and stocked. The play area looked clean and the games and rides were working.  I will not be taking my family here anymore. Its really sad to see that happen because this place was so awesome. Shame on you management.",

    "text": "I am so upset with my recent experience here. We came here during the week since I had a bogo coupon for teacher appreciation week. We drove all the way across town and wish we wouldn't have. The place was dead. There were a couple tables of people in each room. A lot of the food looked like it had been sitting out all day. The sauces for the pasta were dried and crusty. A lot of the food items had one or two pieces left or were completely empty. I spent a lot of time tracking down someone to make fresh food instead of getting to sit down and enjoy my dinner. What pissed me off the most was that I had to wait an hour, yes an hour, for them to make more of their donuts. I asked 4 different people. They all told me they would start making them and they'd be out shortly. Every time I asked someone new, nobody had heard anything about it. They told me they still had some out. Ummm...yea they did, but they were hard as a rock. I couldn't even break them with my hand. No donut should feel like that. I finally had to go up to the front and a manager finally heard me and made them make me some. It should have never been an issue. They should be checking up on their food constantly and not leaving left out old food for customers to eat. We were there for almost 2 hours (due to waiting for the donuts) and I didn't see any desserts or any of the hot food ever get replaced or filled up since they were empty, except for the pizzas. Half the time, there was not a single person working out on the floor to get help from. It was absolutely ridiculous. I asked what the issue was and they blamed it being on one of their \"slow nights.\" Slow night or not, you should always be producing good quality food and keeping the food available to the customers who are there. I used to like this place, but it's been going downhill, quality of food is not what it was when they first opened. After this experience, I will not be coming be back here.  The arcade part is not part of this review. If you want to take the kids to go have some fun, it's not a horrible place to take them, but I'd definitely not get the food here. Save your money and go get food elsewhere.",

Everything was smooth and the people that worked to help keep everything organize and fun for the kids, were great.   The pizza is delicious and they also have other buffet style options on the main floor. I saw salad bar, pasta, pizza, donuts, drinks and slushes.   All the games pretty much work unlike Chuck E. Cheese or something lol. And there's a ton of variety of games.   They also have rides, mini golf, bumper cars, and mini bowling.   The kids really enjoy themselves.  And there's even alcoholic beverages for the parents to enjoy themselves as well.   The only thing that really sucks is the parking. There isn't a lot of parking so when it's busy it's pretty impossible to find one near by. There's also sea quest next door that shares the same parking.",

    "text": "First review of 2019! I've been here a few times now, most recently being for my son's 2nd birthday. There are plenty of different themed rooms, so finding a place to sit is never a problem. I do suggest to arrive early for a well stocked/clean buffet and less wait on games.   The one huge draw back is that you can't just come here to play games. You still have to pay the entrance fee even if you aren't going to eat. So just play some games to work up an appetite and then grab a bite afterwards.  On to the food, it's not amazing, but it's not totally terrible. You can't expect gourmet food at a place that caters to kids. So everyone needs to get off their high horse and lower their expectations. The salad bar is fairly decent. There's plenty of toppings and the lettuce is fresh and crunchy. I usually get 2 plates of salad. The pizza is comparable to frozen pizza from the grocery store. There's fried chicken and pasta as well and that's just whatever to me too. There's cookies, cinnamon rolls, ice cream and mini donuts for dessert. There's a soda fountain with an Icee machine. And for the adults there's a bar, which I think is a horrible idea because you're supposed to be watching your kids.   A few of the games were out of order the couple times I've visited. And some of the machines weren't dispensing tickets. So we had to call an attendant to give us our tickets. Just an FYI, a lot of the games just load e-tickets onto your play card so you aren't carrying around a bunch of paper tickets. Just a forewarning, the prizes they offer for ticket redemption are pretty terrible. After $15 worth of play, all we got was 2 plastic unicorn rings for my niece and a styrofoam airplane that my son ripped apart in 10 seconds. But it's the enjoyment of playing with the kids that counts.   Overall, I've had fun at this establishment and I can overlook the below average food. My son enjoys his time here, so I'm sure we will be back.",

    "text": "What a crock this place is for customer service! My sister just had my nephew's birthday party here, the booked a party room for 1pm weeks ago. Today comes she gets a call at 11:30AM asking if they are still showing up for the bday party.... Somehow there had been a mix up even tho she made it online, and got an email confirmation that her party was 1pm somehow the restaurant still got 11AM. Anyhoo they say no matter what we will accomodate you, they actually gave us a whole room like one of the rooms in the main dinning area, the Kaledescope room all to ourselves. Seemed pretty sweet at first thought! So all was well. Until the pinata and balloons my sister had ordered as add ons for the party at the time she booked where no where to be seen. But if they thought the party was at 11 and they called her at 11:30 asking where they were, shouldn't the pinata and balloons be ready already? As well as the center piece? But nothing. Normally when you get the regular party rooms an employee is in there the whole time, doing balloon animals, and games and clearing the plates and getting anything you need. We had no one. Someone came for minute and did balloon animals but no games, no one was there to cut the cake or clear any plates. If you book a party there it literally gives you an itinerary of times like 1pm balloon animals 1:30-2 games and music 2-15 incredibear so on and so on and we received nothing but the balloons and then zip. Well my sister had to ASK not to be charged for the pinata and balloons she did not receive, she also had to ASK for a discount for the mix up that was not her fault and for literally not getting the whole birthday package that she book and that discount was 10 dollars...... W....t.....f... Thats ridiculous! She did not get what she paid for! It was kinda cool to have the whole big room to ourselves, even tho people still kept coming in it despite a sign that said reserved for private party, and we did not receive the whole birthday package which she booked and paid for. And like where are the pinata and balloons? Like if you thought we were coming at 11 and you called at 11:30 like where are you, it should just be a matter of transferring them to another room but we never saw them. Oh they were on the bill tho. Oh and they ran out of cups in the dining room, like completely. There are 3 tray sections with cups all were empty for a while and we had to ask for <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmore.cuosnto.be&s=1e75f52440e1522253dafff5c80b4c87de0c436d804a65fa393a01c72842ac7c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">more.cuosnto.be</a> brought out and wait for them to come out. On a Saturday. Like they know they are gonna be busy. This place is a hot mess!  Go to Chucky cheese instead for your parties for real. It was a terrible experience and not a person there seemed to care. At all. This place sucks",

    "text": "This place has gone downhill since it opened. We stopped going to Chuck E Cheese and started coming here because the games at Chuck E Cheese were always broken, failed to pay out tickets half the time, and it always felt dirty.  Now John's seems to have fallen under the same demise.  Our most recent visit, it seemed every other game was jammed.  The working games ran out of tickets rather frequently, and trying to get a staff member to help you was near impossible. We waited over 20 minutes, asking staff members at least three different times, to help us retrieve our tickets from a game.  It seems they were very short staffed.  We pushed the call bell for a ride, and after waiting 15 minutes with no one coming over to run the ride, we eventually gave up.  And this was on a Friday night, which I would think would be prime time and thus have prime staffing.  (BTW, Friday night was not prime time. We expected it to be packed, and it was like a ghost town.)  The mini golf wasn't even open, which is one of my kids' favorite part.  All the balls were removed, so maybe they are shutting that part down.  The food is terrible   Just very bland food options, poorly made.  (The pizza at Chuck-E-Cheese is actually better!) Most of the desserts were inedible.     So while I'm not a fan, my kids still love it, and it is still better than Chuck-E-Cheese, so with no other option in town, we will probably continue to come.  They could be soooooo much better though. There is so much potential for this to be a great establishment and it just fails.",

ASAP.  I cannot begin to explain the disgusting practices I witnessed during our visit. In general, you take a gamble when going to any buffet, however, when you mix in unsupervised children serving themselves, understaffed stations, and a FILTHY ice cream machine and surrounding areas, you must pray that you don't get food poisoning.   Staff moved around slow as molasses, kids were dripping food, dropping food, and licking fingers. It was absolutely revolting. The area meant to keep \"clean\" dishes had crumbs and food particles EVERYWHERE.   Onto the family restroom: Poopy diapers in open trash containers, debris, filth and soap container wide open with the broken lid on the floor. John's Incredible Pizza should be absolutely horrified by the amount of 1 star reviews they deserved. Do something, your customers could get sick!!",

I will never trust this parent's recommendations again.  I guess John's is a good idea for kids.  They have kid friendly food - pizza (obviously), pasta, and a selection of desserts.  It's all you can eat, so the kids can fill up.  They have games, and the kids can win prizes.  So, all in all, it is a kid friendly place.  It is not adult friendly.  Food was terrible - wilted salad, suspect veggies on the salad bar, tasteless pizza and pasta.  They were constantly out of veggies on the salad bar and the dressings looked like they had seen better days.  I ate very little.  There is a small bar where you can get beer, wine, or wine based margaritas.  A couple beers made things sort of tolerable for me.  Our other option was to go bowling.  I would have rather eaten at a bowling alley any day.",

Ive been to some pretty bad Buffett's but this was by far the worst.   Once we got to the arcade we were a little more impressed because of how much bigger their selection was. But we noticed majority of their games were either out of order or broke down. Never again. Honestly, should have gone to the Rex-center next door.",

The worst part was, they only cooked half a pan, and the re e were at least 50 people waiting on all of the dishes. They had to cook another batch of chicken because again, they ran out dur to cooking so limited.   Another 25 minutes of wait, we finally got their chicken. OMG! CHICKEN IS STILL RAW!   Their rides? please, don't fooled and buy the unlimited rides. They don't have enough staff to cover each station, or each ride, at least. Waited 5 minutes for someone to start the ride They only have 4 rides. You will be frustrated with this place. I know my kids, my family, and I were, including the other customers with their kids.

The buffet was not kept up seemed like no one cared about their job. I know this was no fine dining experience but there is no reason it should have been this bad. I'm so disappointed because growing up in California I always went to johns incredible Pizza and never once had a bad experience. Our server never once came back to our table to clear our plates. We had to find an employee everything we needed anything. We waited 15 min at the bar for a bartender. It was one thing after another. We spent 115 for 4 people and what a waste of money. The games were decent but nothing exciting as many were not even working to begin with. I spoke to a manager and she said this is just how it is. :(",

    "text": "If I was a kid I would have the biggest boner for this place.  I'd be begging my parents to go here every weekend!  It's like if Chuck E. Cheese & Cici's pizza had a baby and named him John.  And then John grew up and built this sick-ass indoor buffet/arcade/mini amusement park.  Went on Sunday 1-3-16 around 11:30 AM.  You must pay for the buffet in order to get to the rides and games.  Adults are $10.99 and my 18 month old was free.  We also bought 75 \"credits\" for $14.99.  Instead of tokens you get credits loaded onto a card that you swipe at each game.  You can pick whether you would like paper tickets or electronic tickets.  I chose to fist-bump mother earth by choosing electronic tickets.   The buffet was one step above Cici's to me...they had some higher quality ingredients for the salads, desserts, and pizzas and definitely had more variety. Once you fill up your tray with goodies you pick one of five dining rooms.  They have a sports themed one, a cabin one, a cartoon one, a kaleidescope one which was like a diner, and the fusion room which was just playing 90's music on a big screen.  They have a lovely toddler area, kiddie bowling, mini golf, bumper cars, and two rides.  Everything in the place is brand spankin' new and absolutely beautiful.  The place is huge as well...I bet it would hold at least 300 people.  They have 4 or 5 private party rooms as well.  Each game took around 3-4 credits so 75 credits lasted quite a while and we were quite satisfied with the value.  I wish my son was bigger so he could appreciate the awesomeness of this place!  If you've got kids go check it out!!!",

The prices to get in is very reasonable. $10 for adults and  $5 for kids.  It includes unlimited buffet and drinks. I believe there are 3 or 4 dining area. But each of them are dirty and lack bussers. Food and drinks left all over the tables, chairs and floors. I could only find 1 worker cleaning up the whole dining area.   They serve same food as Chuckecheese but a lot of trays in the buffet are empty. People are taking them faster than they can make.  They had a good selection of games but I'd say 1/3 games are not in service.",

I purchased 2 one hour unlimited ride for my children and $20 card(100 credit)The guy gave my kids one of the $20 card instead of 2 unlimited ride card. I had no idea about it. I put one card in my bag. Planning to use it after they are done with the ride. Walked inside and had to wait at least 10 minuets for the first ride because nobody is working. And then the next ride we had to wait at least 10 minuets also ( nobody is working). One employee saw us and said \" I will be back \" and she never showed up. Lol. Then we had lunch and play the first game with the card that I had in my bag. Come to find out that the card that I had was a unlimited ride card. And the whole time my son had $20 card. I went to talk to the manager. She was useful. She gave me 50 credits instead of the full refund of $20. She said that the best she can do. Really!!!!! I never go back there again. This place is a rip off. And nobody working there. I prefer Dave's & Busters. I never had problems there and if you have a problem with the machine they help you right away and alway do the right thing by giving your credit back.",

    "text": "Short review: Definitely worth checking out. Tons of fun for the kids. Very reasonably priced, and a decent buffet.  Long review: We brought the kids and relatives from out of town on Friday. You can only get in (to the games and rides) if you pay for the buffet (10.99 adults, less for kids) I actually loved that because it gets rid of the people who are just going to hand their unsupervised kids $5 and leave them to their own devices.   We got there early and they were just putting out the food. There were a lot of choices, pizzas, pastas, salads, chicken, rice, many dessert and drink choices also...much better than CiCis, everyone was happy with their food and thought it was a good value for the price.   They have many different themed dining areas which was very cool. We sat in the sports themed room. Everything was very nice and clean, which I'm sure is helped by the fact that this place is new but I am hoping it stays that way . All the employees we encountered were really nice too, especially the ones working the rides and games area.   After eating we went to the games and rides area, and stayed 2 hours! The kids had a blast. We bought the 19.99 cards, which I think came with 100 credits and 1 free ride. The games were very reasonably priced at 2-4 credits each, I believe the rides were 10. The cards lasted the kids a very long time and the rides were awesome. They loved them. We opted to have \"e-tickets\" (the tickets you win automatically load onto the card after the game) and that worked perfectly.   We think this is a great addition to Las Vegas and really hope it stays nice and clean with everything working. It is a great place to take the kids :)",

    "text": "First off I'm a big fan of John's, I use to frequent there locations in California all the time. When i heard they where coming to Vegas I was a happy camper..   Well they opened their Las Vegas location on Dec. 29th 2015. I'm a bit confused as to why they did not advertise this more..  I went on News years day and was surprised at the amount or lack of business. Talked to a few employees and they said the opening has been a lot less the expected.   But that being said.. This place is done up very well.. 5 themed rooms to dine in.. from cartoons to sports to just a quiet room to relax. Its a buffet style restaurant , so its a serve yourself..   The buffet offers a nicely stocked salad bar, baked potato bar, pizza bar where the show case some unique pizzas such as a peanut butter ( not my fave ), cheese burger, bbq chicken, chicken ranch and a host of others.. And if you do not see what you like they will make it for you. they have a pasta and bread stick bar, fried chicken, mojo style potatoes, soups and of course your desert bar. Good selection of drinks including beer and wine ( beer and wine is additional cost ) . Milk is also available from the bar. ( think outside the box here people, make shakes with milk and ice cream ). its all you can eat and drink. the food is better then cc's and way better then chucky cheese.   After dining they have a nice arcade of things to do.. Now I am a bit disappointed in this area.. its seems rather void of games compared to the California locations..  although they do have some very nice high hd type that I have not seen in Cali.. They have glow in the dark miniature golf, mini bowling, bumper cars and a tilt a whirl type ride in the center.   Games give out tickets that can be redeemed for prizes.. most machines are a bit stingy on tickets but a few pay off rather well..  The prize booth has a nice selection of prizes to chose from..    All in all a very nice 3 to 4 hours can be spent here with the family..  Another stop for those with children who visit Las Vegas as well as the locals..",

I can deal with the $11 bucks a person and $2 extra for a drink, but when I purchased the \"best value\" fun card I was under the assumption the rides and games would be working. The bumper cars were out of order and that was one we wanted to ride. Even some of the arcade games weren't working. I feel like I should get half my money back. The pizza was old, and the food was dry. The bathrooms were dirty, as well as the silverware and plates. Far from the Johns I'm use to in LA, but that's what happens when you put a place like this smack dab in the middle of the hood! Maybe I'll come back during peak hours and hopefully they get it together! Will come back one more time to give another review. This place shouldn't be open with all the crap going on here.",

Only half of buffet was open because I'm assuming it's not busy enough for the place to be fully functional, but with that being said, since it was not a busy night I cannot understand why things weren't more tidy and replenished sooner, if at all. When it was time to visit the game area everything seemed to be working, nothing was out of order. But there were not enough attendants operating the rides. So more then a few times tonight my kids waited until someone showed up to be able to get on the very few rides they have. I understand that business demands dictate staffing, but what's the point of me purchasing unlimited rides for 3 hours when your rides aren't being offered at an unlimited pace? I'd definitely seek out other kid friendly places before spending money here again.",

    "text": "We went a Friday afternoon, it was SO MUCH FUN!  We spent about $90 for two adults, a 6 yr old and a 7 yr old: all you can eat buffet, and 120 credits to play with a VIP card... We were there for about 3 hours, my kids had a blast with the bumper cars, the bowling, miniature golf, the spinning ride, and the boat. It was like a perfect family day and we pigged out!   The buffet was well stocked, pizza was ok. Salad bar was awesome! The fried chicken is good, And the cinnamon rolls and cookies were hot and fresh!!   I've seen the bad comments about this place being dirty, but I think it's exaggerated... The floors were a bit dirty but it's understandable for a place that big with food and play for CHILDREN to get a smudge here and there... However, we didn't go over the weekend, that's when it seems to get hectic..  Over all we loved it and will for sure make this our family Friday fun spot",

They are supposed to pay attention to the rides while someone is on it, but they were busy texting someone ! These people do not care about our safety.",

Love the idea that I didn't have to give my kids tokens for them to drop and lose, instead it was a card which was reloadable. Purchased a $20 deal and it lasted wayyyy longer than I expected.

    "text": "This place was a pleasant surprise.  My daughter really loved the games and especially the rides.  It was very spacious and not too crowded when we went anyways.  Prices end up being pretty reasonable even after having to pay admission at the door.  I wasn't sure I liked the fact that they charged admission but the prices inside were reasonable enough that it probably all balances out in the end and probably keeps people from just coming in and taking up space by hanging out and not spending any money.  Actually a smart move the more I think about it.  Anyways... great variety of games and rides.  Mini bowling and mini golf were nice.  Rides were good overall.  Food wasn't very good as is to be expected for a low end buffet type place.  But edible enough.  You probably aren't coming here for the food so it is acceptable.  Several dining areas which was kinda cool for different age groups.  TVs in all rooms with different things on for various age groups.  One complaint would be that we sat in a kids room that had a cartoon on for about 5 minutes then a 30 minute infomercial on the shark vacuum cleaner that they couldn't seem to figure out how to change.... so we were exposed to a full 30 minutes of that junk.  Lol  But the pros outweighed the cons and we will be back.",

That someone and their group of people would invest in a space as big as this, create tons of new jobs AND be interested in giving you a healthy option for kids (with a beer station still for adults), the only word should be appreciation, unless you want them to close. I was appalled reading some of the reviews. I actually didn't want to review them because it was so packed and I didn't want to compete for space, but these reviews are not fair. I am a business owner myself also. Stuff costs money. Look at John's Incredible Pizza Co. How could people even complain?? They tried to provide five different rooms and this lady complained about only one serving area. I own a restaurant. It's one serving area because of licenses and handwashing sinks and bathrooms that needed to be provided. They have five different dining rooms. Let's focus on that! They have nine TVs that create this big screen, any sports fan's dream. They make pizzas on demand.  They have tons of awesome games and digital tickets to boot. They are still new and need to figure out how many technicians to staff for the machines. But even though the machines were down easily, they were also up again easily. My son was having a blast. He was enjoying the lights and pizza. He thought soft-serve was yummy. I may not have really enjoyed the pizzas as much but they weren't bad. And choices were amazing.",

After an hour all the sudden it appears. We could not find any attendants to ride the rides but then had to wait for the employees to finish riding it when it was open. i heard them say over the walkie john from john's was in all of the sudden the food was fresh they were cleaning the food bars.

    "text": "Went here yesterday for an end of the year party for our Troop. First off they put us in a party room that was too small for our party so not everyone could even sit down and eat. Then they tried to do party games with our 18 kids and trying to do them in a small corner of the room was ridiculous. Half the kids couldn't even get any tickets or balloon animals.  Now for the food. I've been here 3 times before and this was quite possible the worst the buffet yesterday. First off there was very little selection and the workers told us fat we had to ask for any pizza that wasn't out there. What? You don't have plain cheese or pepperoni pizza in a pizza buffet? Then we asked for a pizza and that took forever to make! We also asked for a second soup (the potato one) and it took almost an hour for them to \"make\" it and then they literally put out one bowl. Not a pot, but enough to fill one bowl. My girls asked if they were going to put out any more desserts (there was a chocolate cake but some idiot had let their child smash all the pieces with the tongs.)  and they said \"no we aren't wasting food.\" Seriously? Is this food coming out of their mouth? Not to mention this is Vegas, I can spend $14 and go to a real buffet where I don't have to ask for food to be made and can actually eat more than one slice.  The games were good, most in good repair, the kids always like the rides. However claiming our tickets was a total nightmare. The scanner gun wasn't working. Then we tried to combine 2 cards and she accidentally erased all the credits!!! What?! Then the manager came but didn't know how to put them back on so they gave us paper tickets to go feed into the machine and put back on the card. So because of your mistake I now have to work twice as hard for some cheap toy. You can't just take the card and give me the toy?  Needless to say the kids like it because I don't think they care about anything, but the logistical nightmare of this place is ridiculous. You have multiple people working there that I think are just there to make it seem like there's workers but don't really do anything. For the amount we paid, we will be going elsewhere next time.",

We took the kids to the new Johns here in Vegas and I have to say that I have mix reactions.   We arrived and the entrance looks really cool which is what you expect as it is a kids fun center. We paid, the prices are reasonable for a buffet style restaurant. We then went in straight into the buffet area to get pizza there was just one problem.....No Pizza!   There were a few slices of pizza from two old stale looking pizzas. There was two pcs of chicken that looked stale, and mojos that we're stuck together and we're as hard as rocks.  I was very disappointed at the food options. Not what I expected from Johns.   After 5 minutes they started to bring pizza out and more options, this only happened after more people started showing up at the stations.   As far as the games for the kids, no issues there for the exception of some games that were out of order which is expected when they are in use every single day.   Overall not what I expected, I'll probably give them another chance but will not be spending my money here anytime soon.",

Those are the pros, the cons are the food selection is very poor.  Many stations were empty and they were not replenishing dishes!  We came around several times and the remnants of the same sorry food was left out, dried up and unappetizing. The ice cream machine was very dirty with loads of piled up ice cream and no one around to clean it up.  Not the workers fault, poor management.",

At times the food supply goes empty, just tell someone and they refill it. I've never had problems with my requests when something wasn't available. This is a great place to grab some tasty food, drinks, let the kiddies run around to get on rides and play games and tire themselves out!! It's reasonably priced too, as long as you actually eat, maybe twice at that. The staff has always been awesome with us and I've never had issues with service here.

Now, I can understand not being able to keep some standards of cleanliness in a buffet mainly catering to a younger clientele I can overlook... but, I need the kitchen staff and management ask themselves this question \" Is the food that is  placed out for the public to eat, Would I eat it?\"    Having to tell the ONE staff member who seemed to be behind the 5 food corals \" that the fresh vegetables at the salad bar were rotten and the new replacements were as well made me sad that they DIDN'T KNOW THEY WERE ROTTEN, JUST BY LOOKING AT THEM,  Hint, to the young kitchen staff if vegetables and or fruit are producing white milky liquid, and if the vegetables are supposed to be crunchy NOT SOFT AND SLIMY.... THEY ARE ROTTEN!!!!!!  Five times I had to pull a set of 4 FORKS, each time 1-2 where still with food,  chips on most drinking cups, 1 of the staff members was giving a tour to a potential customer and walked over food that was on the floor for the entire 25 minutes we stayed... SO LOOKING BACK... $40 lunch +60$( 2 funcards) not even used for 25minutes.  For Shame on management. You need to lead, not make friends!!! The only pleasant experience was as we were leaving speaking with Darcy I believe was the grey shirt I spoke with.",

    "text": "I have to do a review on this place from my last two visits . Last Monday I planned a day with the kids that included John's Incredible Pizza Company around noon . I did get a email from Johns that ha a special only on Mondays for kids being under $4 so figured that's a good deal so I planned a week prior by getting the day off and making sure I actually had the kids that day. When we arrived at the location they had security at door saying that there is a special event so they won't be open till 5pm . I'm like why would they schedule a special event on a day (they only day of the week) that they have a special coupon deal . I called the contact line they had and they did call me back saying they will give me a free pass so just give them my email. When I get email it was for an$5 play card . My issue is not that they only have me $5 but that if they have a special coupon day , maybe it would be a good idea not to plan a special event that closes the place till 5pm .   The kids love this place so I took my son today , I couldn't take the other two kids (niece and nephew) because they had other plans . Today we got in with no issue, ate , played games for about a hour or so but when it came to redeeming the tickets that my son earned from game we had to wait over 30 mins till a employee showed up to serve us . The places looked pretty busy but only seen 2 employees working in game areas one (looked like manager) was manning one ride and the other was manning the other ride . I seen more people on registers then actually working on floor . 4 on register 2 on floor . Sorry for the rant but it's just hard to find things to do with kids here in Las Vegas so you would think places like this would do better .. thank you to whoever reads this !! Not saying not to go here because kids love it but be careful because it might be closed and prepare to wait if you need anything ..",

I mean the foods nothing to write home about but coming to a place like this you know it's primarily to have some fun with the kids. And that we did! It was clean, food was hot, wasn't over crowded, nice selection of games, spent 3 hours there and kids had a blast. With the selection of games, rides, the ease of using the play cards, and not dealing with tickets this was far better than going to chuckle cheeses, CiCi's, or Peter Piper.  Yeah I said it lol they also served beer n wine! I'll hit that up next time though because We'll definitely be back!",

The food was as good as you'd expect it to be from a family buffet, so that wasn't necessarily disappointing as it was anticipated. The staff was kind in our dining area but the manager on duty didn't mask frustration well regarding a party mixup for my nephew.   Ultimately the front area handling that mixup was the only thing that brought this from 4 to 3 stars. That and it took the table next to us was dirty from arrival to departure of our time here. Better maintenance would be nice in the future.",

Their buffet advertising is also misleading. Half of the pizza flavors are not \"hot and ready\". Many others items are out of stock at the buffet.   My five year old neice had fun at this place, but it is nothing special. The concept is good, but poorly executed. The buffet is a poor value for money.  The game selection is slightly better than Chuck E Cheeses and is more spacious.  A few games were broken, which is pretty typical for these kind of places. You would save a lot of money by going to CiCis for dinner and Gameworks for the arcade.  Definitely not worth a drive across town.",

You have families and big group parties with children excited to eat and play. Of course its bound to get a bit messy. There was plenty of staff trying their best to replenish and clean up the areas. I will say the whole time we were dining there was a few dirty tables around us that did not get any attention. The food was decent, you cant expect 5 star dining, but we ate well and had a great time!  Kudos for the arcade and the rides! It definitely makes it easier to play and you dont feel as crowded as other places. The kids cant wait to go back.",

    "text": "Update:  While I stand by my review below, I was impressed with 1 thing: The manager at the prize area gave my daughter an 850 ticket prize even though she only had 790 tickets just because she saw it was her birthday. They also aren't picky about you moving from your party room to the general seating tables which is cool. If you come for lunch you can likely even have an early dinner which is cool. I added 2 stars back for this. I hope they address the other issues.  Original Content:  I am so disappointed by the birthday package we purchased and our experience today. I was all jazzed when I booked the party yesterday and I feel so let down.   We paid $22.99 each for 6 kids and $12.99 each for 3 adults. When I booked online, I chose the option to pay the entire bill at the time of booking. Today, one of our kid guests backed out of attending but I figured I would just eat the cost of that extra kid's fee. We checked in which was a longer process due to a large party in front of us which dug into our party time since they only had 1 party line open. Now keep in mind that if your party starts at 12pm and ends at 1:45pm and they hold you up at the register checking in, you do NOT get extra time in the room. We were about 15 mins late getting to our party room due to their delay.   So we finished checking in and met our VERY nice attendant, Lizeth (may have been Lizbeth). She was fun, friendly and seemed to enjoy her job.   One thing I found odd was I thought the room would include decorations like table cloths and cups but it's just tables and balloons. They do have a cable TV in there and the kids put on Disney.   One odd thing is that although I paid for everything online when I booked, the manager still showed up wanting us to \"settle\" our bill. Apparently when I paid online it was only a deposit although they had offered me the option pay a $75 deposit which is when I decided to pay the whole bill because I didn't want to bother with financials on the day of the party. Also ofd because they took the full bill out of my account online (my online receipt shows this). So when we checked in with only 5 people we went below the minimum booking amount of $170.   So the manager shows up and pulls us to the back room to ask about our bill. Long story short is that instead of just charging me for what I paid for online, they adjusted the people who did show up to a higher package for 5 kids and 3 adults. Pricing was almost the same at the end which is fine but just the hassle of having to be pulled away for another 10 minutes from the party was annoying after the delayed check in. And the kicker? They wouldn't give us the token cards until the manager ran my bank card so we didn't get the kids their tokens until about 1 hour and 30 mins into our 1 hour 45 minute party. And you bet they kicked us out of the room at the 1 hour 45 minute mark.   One other thing that made it awkward was the manager asking us how much to add for the hostess' tip. While I had planned to tip the sweet girl who had been so nice to us, it was awkward and uncomfortable to have the manager ask us and stand there while I decided what to give. Some things deserve some privacy for goodness sake.   Regarding the buffet, pizza was super scarce. They really need to speed up production, after all it is a buffet and mid-Saturday in Las Vegas. The donuts they made were crunchy (overcooked)  The games are fun but good luck trying to win a stuffed animal. I spent about 180 credits/tokens trying to win just one (and never did).  The prizes you can redeem are so overpriced. Other places that I'm not naming offer much more reasonably priced prizes and allow you to pay with cash the balance. They had a weird, complex policy here about only being able to pay for 25% of the value of the item or something like that. Maybe being a paramedic with a masters degree makes me less able to figure out complicated policies and procedures.   So overall, I'm disappointed. I took a chance on Johns Incredible Pizza and it was a bust. I honestly think I may just do home parties in the future or even try somewhere else. I'm sorry it wasn't better.",

My kid always has a good time here. We mostly play games and will probably try out the rides, bumper cars, and mini golf on a weekday. This place blows Chuck E Cheese out of the water. There are games for everyone, like kiddie games, racing, shooting games, etc.. There is even a toddler area with a small slide and other fun stuff for older infants and young tots.   The food here is alright, nothing to brag about. Lower your expectations and be realistic. This place is for kids, not a Las Vegas strip buffet or a foodie destination. It's an all you can eat buffet that offers salad, soups, pasta, pizza, breadsticks, fried chicken, desserts, and ice cream.  There are some pretty odd flavors that I would probably not try again like the cheeseburger pizza and spicy peanut pizza. I did enjoy the freshly made mini donuts, cinnamon rolls, and cookies! The different themed rooms for dining are pretty cool. We normally stick with the cartoon room closest to the front, which plays Disney cartoons and decorated with kid friendly characters.   All staff that I have come across have been friendly, helpful, and are constantly cleaning and clearing used plates.   4 stars for the games and good experiences here!   *****Yelp 2016 100 Challenge***** 18/100",

    "text": "We've been here a couple times for birthday parties, once just with the family and the other time with a big group in one of their party rooms. It's pretty cool because there are several rooms that are adjustable in size and there are multiple party package options from $12.99 to $29.99pp.  There is a lot of pricing information, so I would recommend viewing it here: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnspizza.com%2Flas-vegas%2Fadmission-and-pricing&s=dc0716cf50dd693fafc3e7ba0eda605043ab66d9cbae7b691431be9dd050d89d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">johnspizza.com/las-vegas...</a>. Basically, if you're just here to eat, the AYCE buffet is $8.29 to $11.49 for adults (13+) and it's FREE to $7.29 for kids depending on age (12 and under). These prices do not include beverages though. Unlimited beverages is $1.99 for everyone. There are a lot of beverage options including soda, Icee, coffee, hot chocolate, cappuccino, etc. And yes, there is alcohol for purchase at a dedicated bar (beer, wine, and frozen margaritas).  In short, the food is terrible. I took a tour of this place before they opened and given the whole spiel about the food being made fresh in-house, etc. So, I was expecting quality or at the very least, tasty food. Let's start with their namesake, pizza. This probably has the most potential, but the toppings are shamefully scarce and if you're in the market for the more exciting options, you won't have much luck; very few are offered and even if they are, it's always out. The pasta options are okay, but the salad bar is severely lacking. I didn't like the Chicken Pot Pie Stew or Fried Chicken either; both tasted very strange.  If you're here for the entertainment as well, you need to purchase a FunCard for 50 and each credit is 25. Games cost 1-6 credits and rides/attractions cost up to 10 credits each.  Fun World is very impressive; the rides and attractions especially. Their version of bumper cars called Boogie Bump is much cooler than the classic, there's Glow-in-the-Dark Mini Golf, and a twirling ride in the middle of all the action. They seem to have all the games at you'd typically find at an arcade or similar business. I really enjoyed the Galaxy Collision QuadAir Hockey Table during our recent visit (imagine four players and four pucks for an ultimate air hockey game). Some games dispense tickets that can be redeemed at the prize counter.  Bottom line, you're here for the kids. They enjoy it, so I guess you put up with the bad food, plus, it is really inexpensive.",

    "text": "The Urban Legend of this place called John's Incredible Pizza came to light about two years ago when someone told me they serve a PB&J Pizza.  While driving down Maryland Parkway last week I saw this flashy facade that looked like the Children's Discovery Museum.  I had to do a double take and I am glad that I did otherwise I would have never discovered this new family fun center others have been boasting about.    The perfect day to come was a rare rainy Tuesday afternoon.  Upon entering we we impressed by the sheer size of this facility.  After purchasing everyone's meal pass we went right for the food to keep the fun zone hidden from the kids otherwise we would never get them to eat.  John's Incredible is a buffet style restaurant that has a great selection of salad bar items, pizza, pasta, dessert and beverages.  For one price of $12+ for adults and $5 for kids, you can stuff your face and afterwards you can go have a great time in the fun center.    I really enjoyed the salad bar section.  All items were fresh and diced so you can have great topping distribution.  They have at least 6 different types of noodles and several sauces for endless pasta creations.  The bread sticks are huge and they also have other dinner items like soups, baked potatoes, chicken, rice, and steamed veggies.  All food is labeled clearly for dietary restrictions like vegetarian and gluten free, I think that is a huge plus for this brand. They have so much food its INCREDIBLY overwhelming.    The pizza choices reminded me exactly like Cici's combinations.  For example, Fiesta Pizza, Cheeseburger, Alfredo, Chicken Alfredo, Pep + Jalapeno, Ham +Pineapple, Pepperoni, Chili pizza,Spicy Peanut Butter and Garlic Pesto were some of the offering's.  The pizza is by no means incredible.... but it is edible.  Kitchen workers were working hard to keep everything fresh and well stocked.  The crust and sauce were the downfalls for these pies in my opinion.  The slices were to small and floppy and I prefer a more crispy crust.  And if you did not get enough food off the salad and pizza buffet line John's hits you with a huge selection of sweet treats in the dessert line.  Items like, cookies and cream cakes, brownies, cinnamon rolls, apple crisp, peach cobbler, fruit salad, coolies and even ice cream.  WOW! there is a lot of food to choose from at John's.  The place is so big they have 6-7 different themed dining rooms that I am assuming you can rent out for birthday parties and such.  Once you clean your plate then you get to go play in the game center.  I was surprised to see the different high quality games that can be played here.  No dirty coins or money accepted here.  All games require a special credit type card that can be swiped to play each game.  Each game varies in cost from 2-6 credits, rides vary from 8-10 credits.  My favorite was the \"Boogie Bump\" which is a 21st century version of bumper cars.  I could have ridden those all day.  They also have mini bowling lanes, glow mini golf, a tornado type ride that spins, and also a toddler area for the little babies to have fun.  We were only able to be here for about an hour because of a school night but we will be back to John's Incredible Pizza because the entire family had a blast. I think we might do our next Birthday Party here.",

Walk over to the buffet 1 pizza sitting there stale and hard as a rock ! Asked for pizza and they said $10 mins  Walk over to the pasta section , pasta looked brown the Alfredo sauce looked disgusting more brown than white . Asked for chicken they only fry per request 20 mins !  Nothing out in the salad bar . Keep in mind I have 4 kids who are hungry and I bribe them to eat with the games they get to play . So we decide to leave . Ask for a refund they call a manager , young african American lady didn't get her name . She tells me it's over $100 she has to call corporate and that will take about 30 mins or so .... 4 kids hungry ... not to mention we are hungry aswell . So she tells me well I can refund you the food and you keep the fun cards . $60 I had no choice but to agree needed to go feed our kids . So I threw away $60 . Well didn't throw it away gifted it to a horrible company who has no customer service !  Of course she kept the original receipt because she \"needed\" it to explain the partial refund . Bullshit ! We leave and I call corporate they supposedly take down everything that happened and will call me back in 2 days .  Meantime we went to Chuck E. Cheese on eastern and 515 fwy ! All you can play $25 for 90 mins soooo much more customer service oriented  here !! Trust me don't waste your time at Johns incredible pizza there is nothing incredible there !!!   Fast forward to today Thursday the 7th  Haven't heard back from corporate . So I call them back ! They have no information at all from what happened ! Nothing in the system ! The 20 mins I spent on the phone were all for show ! She didn't input nothing ! Now this lady tells me I can't get a full refund because u have the cards and they don't refund it because I can go and use these cards !!!! That her manager is not in but he would not approve of that ! That she can email me comp buffets and since we didn't like the Las Vegas location we have 90 days from today to go to California to use them in either Montclair or riverside. !!!!!! The balls the ***** had to tell me I'm more than welcomed to go to any other location ! I have never ever ever experienced  such horrible customer service !!!! Never again will I go there ! And you shouldn't as well !!!!",

    "text": "One thing that I've always said about this city is that they need to have more places to take kids too. The fact that there is only one location for this place and it's in a \"Not so great\" part of town doesn't help at all. I've been here 3 times already but and my experience has been the same. Super chaotic with kids running everywhere with no super vision from parents. The drink area is always a sticky mess again kids come and drop and spill their drinks and no one to clean it up. I would say the same thing with the food area. I couldn't keep track off how many times I've seen children with no parents come up and grab a pizza slice with their bare hands or just to throw it back with the rest of the pizza. Very unsanitary, you're just asking to get sick. The pizza was okay most of the pizza was stale unless you got lucky and mange to get one right out of the oven. I would say that the chicken here is pretty good but a negative is that as soon as it comes out, it's usually gone within seconds!  The staff here just looks miserable like they don't want to be there. I understand most of them are teenagers but you still have to keep up with customer service.     I would definitely like to see them open up other locations in the Spring valley,  and Henderson area. Just to see what a difference other areas can do for their business. Picking this side of town was a poor mistake.   Overall I wish the business would in prove it's services. My nieces did enjoy the games over all. But I would rather have take them to chuck e cheese  or Gameworks",

Our visits here, it was jam packed with people and its understandable that the buffet was going to be often empty and a mess. It was a brand new kids buffet, so that was expected. The games are fun and there's also a cool ride within the space. Today tho, my family and i did not encounter the crowds nor the long lines. It was almost empty except for a few families including us. So we thought \"ok, wow, cool.\" We get to the buffet and nearly everything was  empty. Sauces looked like they were sitting for hours, and splatters of who-knows-what were all over the serving stations & counter.   OH YEAH! They raised the prices and all the portions are now crazy small!  Smh..  This place has the potential of being one of the cool spots to stop in to when you're near the Boulevard Mall..",

We had a fantastic time, and since we came early in the day, we didn't have to deal with screaming kids, folks fighting over food, or not having anywhere to sit (which was True of my first few visits, so I'm glad I'm reviewing it now). This place is for kids... I can't stress that enough. IT IS FOR CHILDREN. Can adults go here and enjoy the food and games? Definitely. But it's not Dave & Busters. You're going to be navigating through throngs of children. The rooms are themed to cater to children. Can you get a beer or margarita? Sure. Will you enjoy it? It's alcohol, of course you will. But with a backdrop of yelling, Disney toons music and video games, it's fun for the fam, but not if you just want a bite of pizza.  Speaking of the pizza, it's great. You get a fresh variety of basic staples like cheese and pepperoni, and then you can get a little crazy and try the cheeseburger or nacho pizzas. I'd pass on the desserts, they all taste like someone knew the general idea of a dessert, but something was missed in the preparation. The breadsticks are the holy grail, tho. People literally fight over them. STAY AWAY FROM THE OREO CAKE. Those are NOT oreos.   If you're looking for a place to bring your family to tire your kids out before bed, this is your place!",

The buffet items on the salad bar & pasta stations were pretty empty every time we went up there. The napkin holders by all the food stations were empty, both times I went in the women's restroom there were no paper towels to dry off my hands & there didn't seem to be any garbage cans by the tables and only saw one server somewhat cleaning up plates and trash on the tables. That being said, the kids had a blast & even the adults had fun on the games. I will definitely give this place a second chance & hopefully the service is better & more friendly!",

They also shut off the TVs so the kids couldn't watch tv. We talked to a manager and they came back and turned the TVs. After about 10 min of eating again the staff turned the TVs off yet again. So i went back to the manager and complained about the staff they gave us $5.00 play card. As we all proceed to play games and it was time for the prizes. You get one staff member trying to take care of numerous ppl. My friends kid worked hard for one specific lava lamp and they would not allow the display to be taken. If it's not in stock do not display it. He sent us to a manager and who I thought was the manager but they staff didn't know who is in charge.. after 20 min of getting a manager finally got the lava lamp. Very rude staff and do not recommend. If I can leave a review in the negatives they deserve it.. I do not recommend this place and I definitely will not come back here.",

At first entering it seemed reasonable. All u can eat for a flat price then u add on for tokens to play games. Got in and tried to grab some pizza. Wasn't thrilled with the selection and both my kids eat only cheese pizza. The cheese pizza was almost gone so we gave our kids what was there. I decided on a salad and was disappointed to see that that too was almost gone. Even toppings. Figured it's lunch they just might have had a rush come in.  Ate my mediocre salad with the hopes that they had time to refill toppings and lettuce.....NOPE! When I went to get another salad i was even more disappointed. Not only was it low like the first time but most were practically gone with no one even manning the station to refill. My kids who usually scarf pizza like starving wild animals barely touched this pizza.   Oh well, moved on to games. Those were decent. Kids had fun. The dining rooms were fun. My kids LOVED the Disney room. Decided we were ready for dessert, I grabbed and tiny donut and OMG it was hard as a rock. Horrible. My daughter wanted ice cream and there was ice cream spilled EVERYWHERE! If it weren't for the food selection and service I'd probably be willing to give this place a 4th star.",

When we were done playing games we decided to eat since we had already payed for it. First, I had a difficult time finding a clean plate. All the plates in the \"clean\" pile had old mushy food still stuck to them. After about 5 or 6 plates, I found a clean one. There were literally 2 slices of pizza on the whole buffet-and one was a jalapeno pizza my 6 year old will definitely not eat. Most of the food items were out. I managed to find a breadstick to eat while my son had the only slice of pepperoni in the place. If it werent for the fun he had playing the games, I would give this place 0 stars. If its just games you want, go to Dave and Busters.",

    "text": "TLDR: This place helps fill the hole left in the city by the closing of the original GameWorks (which the new one my family calls ChicBarWorks), and is our new favorite to-do. We will be going here again!  We didn't even know this place had opened until we saw a billboard. So we decided to have a late night Sunday adventure.  The place was packed and had a long line, but it was moving fast so that didn't deter us. One of the workers even came out with breadsticks to help keep everyone in a good mood. I never saw a place do this before, and it certainly helped keeping my autistic sons and their friend happy.  They have all dining rooms and rides, whereas what my cousin from Victorville was telling me the one she grew up with didn't have as many options.  The plus side about it being busy is that the food is fresher (although the pasta was cold, at least what I had), and the waiters are picking up dishes and trash often. The pumpkin bars are my favorite, and the apple ones are good as well. The brownies and cheesecake were so good (apparently) that they went fast. Managed to get some cheesecake and was disappointed because it tasted more like a sort of instant custard and didn't taste like cheesecake (rest of my group liked it). The staff was also very kind to my boys.  The downside, as expected on both a weekend and night before a holiday-it is so crowded. When people finally get their turn on a game, especially the ones where most rounds are very short, kids seem patient to let that person play more, while the grown ups snort and are rude if the person at the panel wants to play at least one more time. [Welcome to Vegas, we're full of rude people. I don't down vote places for this.]  Also someone's toddler ran off-thankfully the other lady who was next to me when the little girl came up to us was helping me look for the mum and they were reunited before I could bring her to a worker. Be careful of your smallest ones when it's busy!  Again, the cons were because it's a weekend and the night before holiday. So of course it was packed.  Also, it's very cold outside in the city, but very hot in the restaurant. I brought a sweater expecting it to be cold like Chuck E. Cheese's. Just a heads up for others.",

    "text": "I had my party here (Turned 21, but lots of children in the family) and we all had a great time.   First, for parties, they have a minimum purchase. For one room(maximum occupancy 24) it is $320. I had 26 people, so I called and they were able to book me for 1 room, no problem. They just told me to bring an extra chair in. They saved me so much money when the online portal would not allow me to get one room.  The food is fantastic in my opinion. The pizza is standard, but the breadsticks are pretty good. And they also have lots of desserts to choose from. Unlimited drinks make it great when there is an ice machine.  While it may be a bit expensive to come here just for fun, having a party is WORTH IT not only for the reduced buffet/funworld credit price, but for the service. They played games with the kids, brought in incredibear to take pictures and made all the kids balloon animals to take with them. When we left the party room, they even gave us a trash bag to hold all the balloons so the kids could still play! While I do admit the hosts were a bit shy, the kids still worked great with them.  When the fun cards were handed out, one was dropped, and the manager replaced it after searching for a bit. When we found it and tried to give the extra back, they let us keep it.   The oldest of our group had no issue sitting(and eating) at the cafe area for the rest of the night with all the presents and strollers.",

    "text": "Looking for a step up from chuck e cheeses? Well this would be the place.  Almost the same concept with lots of fun games to play but add on rides and a mini bowling alley, 8 holes glow in the dark mini golf course and all you can eat buffet. How can you not have a blast.  Cons: they make u purchase a buffet weather ur eating or not. And that's because it's hard to tell who's paid to eat and who didn't. Second the buffet itself was nothing to jump for joy. The pizza was so so although they have like 8 different choices. They offered a simple salad bar, and some pasta station as well as dessert station. Can't complain too much since the adult price was 10.95 and kids 3-5 4.99. The pros were the ticket package we Went with the 125 tickets for 25 bucks. We literally had left over tickets after being there for 3 hrs. Over all we would come again.",

They have actual rides and miniature golf which is cool but no arcade games like Street Fighter or NFL Blitz which are multi-player and fun!  Pizza was solid and dessert looked good but didn't try it; Wouldn't try the rest of the food..  Various rooms where you can eat/drink while watching sporting events and movies. I would say it's a better version of CiCi's Pizza and Chuckie Cheese merged.",

    "text": "I visited John's last night for my daughters birthday. At first the price was a little high but compared to Chuck E Cheese it was just a little more. We walked in the place and it appeared big but as you walk in it is more open space with not much really inside. There was only 1 ride opened which was very disappointing as we paid to get extra rides not knowing that. I feel that the lady at the counter should have said something when we bought it. We found a place to sit and the area was clean. The person did a really good job keeping up with cleaning off tables. The food was nasty. By far the worst pizza I have ever had. The salad bar was NOT clean the dressings that should be cold were warm. The soda area was not as clean as I would want but it is a kids place so I understand. Now to the games. We walked into the game area thinking it would be big since what we had seen so far was rather big. What a disappointment. The games were not that great. They cost about 8 credits each. There really isn't enough to do for the amount we paid for. There was only 1 ride open and the attendant was not friendly AT ALL! After about 45 min we were bored and wanting to go home. The kids ended up just using the rest of the card on the 1 ticket spinning machine hoping to at least get something cool at the rewards counter. NOPE! The cost to get just a small little spinner was  like 50 tickets or points. RIP OFF! My son used all his tickets after using his $30 card on a plastic Frisbee that was supposed to make noise when you throw it. He tried it once no noise and it broke when it hit the ground. Chuck E Cheese increased their fees and cost per game. So we said lets try Incredible Johns. At least at Chuck E Cheese you get more at the end. I will NEVER go back. I really feel that I got ripped off and taken for the over $120 I spent. Very disappointing! With Game works, Chuck E Cheese and Dave & Busters I don't expect this place to stay open much longer.",

    "text": "This was my first time here and we had so much fun! We arrived on a Monday during lunch hour so it wasn't super crowded. This facility has several very comfortable dining areas so that you can really enjoy your meal. Some areas had multiple televisions playing sports which was a huge plus for my hubby. We really enjoyed the variety of pizzas, drinks, and desserts. My sister ordered a beer and I ordered a margarita. The strawberry margarita was tasty but I do think it could have used a bit more alcohol. I especially loved their pizza crust recipe. It is very soft and delicious. I had Hawaiian and nacho pizza which I enjoyed very much. There was quite a stampede every time they put out a cheese pizza. So, if you have someone in your family who really wants cheese pizza, be prepared to stalk that station. My 6 year old unfortunately arrived to the cheese pizza station just as a child was taking the last slice. However, it was only a few minutes before another fresh pizza was available. The games and rides were fun for many different ages. The selection of arcade games was substantial and they also have a large variety of prizes to choose from. My daughter especially loved the bumper cars and spinning ride. The staff was very friendly. Everything was very clean and well maintained. My nephew had an accident and the manager promptly offered us a free shirt because we unfortunately didn't bring a change of clothes. We were there for hours and still had many more activities to try. We just couldn't do everything in one day. We will definitely be returning back!",

Remember, it is a pizza buffet in Las Vegas.  You are not going to get a Chicago style pizza, but the pizza is good.  I actually really enjoy the spicy peanut butter!  The themed rooms for eating are great.  My kids love to sit in the cartoon room and watch tv.  If you are looking for family friendly fun at a good price this is it.

    "text": "So.. Where to begin with this experience... It was definitely a mix of many things. First off it took a looong time to pay and get in even though we were first in line. Next, after seeing that it was $11 they tell us that drinks are $2 extra.. Just to get in... The games I suppose are extra. Once we got in we found the rooms were very cute and we chose the cabin themed one. I read on here that there servers come around often. We were there about a half hour and I never saw the server. The food was also a mix. The pizza selection seemed good, but they were out of a bunch of them and most of the others were cold. I did manage to get a piece of a semi warm bbq slice and it was actually pretty good. Later I tried the pepperoni which was fresh and that was decent. I liked the chicken legs, mashed potatoes and corn though.  Then the weird stuff: a fight broke out near us by the mini golf and a bunch of the help had to break it up. We decided to work up the courage to try some games and they were fun. Of course that's after we had a problem with the air hockey game where there wasn't a puck to be found. So after putting in 6 credits without being able to play someone had to come help us. She was very nice and did fix it and gave us our credits back. Much nicer than the guy who told us that since we didn't mention that we signed up online at the front right away it was too late to give us the 10 free credits that we were promised. Totally lame and frustrating. So, I guess I'll round up to 3 stars and chalk it up to opening problems. However, I'm not sure I see paying all that money for cheap food for the right to overpay some more for the games. Let's see what people think as time goes by...",

I am assuming the majority of this has to do with the people who were there, if you drop a whole slice of pizza on the ground you should probably pick it up! A good 1/3 of the games were not working, they either said please stand by, closed or were dark. With the place as busy as it was that meant long lines. There were no employees on the floor trying to fix these issues. Hopefully these are growing pains and they will figure it out soon or open another location in an area of town where people have manners!",

    "text": "I will never come back to his place again! Overly priced when I can get better food at 7-11 and little caesar's pizza. The pizza was raw in the middle. No matter how many time we waited for more pizza to come out every time it was raw in the middle. Along with the breadsticks. They were also raw in the middle. Disgusting!!! The food stations were dirty. There were plates left next to food at food stations. The ice cream bowls were left all over the ice cream station with ice cream piled up in the bottom of the ice cream machine. When you would go get a new dish for food they were dirty along with the bowls for ice cream and the silverware. We only saw a person one time to take dirty dishes off of our table. We have five children and all five said that they didn't ever want to come back to this place. I would never recommend this place to anyone. It was the worst $222.81 I have ever spent.  We have a family of seven total that went and that was the cost for all seven to eat and five kids to play games. We will NEVER be going back!",

    "text": "Took my family of 5 out on a Monday night figured it was not going to be croweded, it was and there was not enough food for the amount of people that were there so we had to wait everytime we went for food. The quality of the food is not the best you can compare it to a frozen dinner box. Half the arcade was out of order including one of the rides for younger kids. Being our first time there we did not have a good first impression and it'll be our last visit for sure. Spent about $120.00 total not worth the experience. The place seems to have potential for a much pleasant experience only if they had a better selection on food (quality) and ALL of their equipment in the arcade were functioning.",

    "text": "I recommend visiting John's incredible on a weekday, hopefully it'll be slower then. I went on a Sunday with my family & it was congested with people. The entire place is loud & overwhelming. The lines for the food, drinks & games are long & chaotic. The food is mediocre, nothing special. If you have kids & they are dying to visit, save money by buying the buffet without drinks. No need to pay extra when cups are left out for all guests. Prepare to deal with large crowds & excessive noise.",

    "text": "Went there for lunch today, was amazed how big the place is. The decor is beautiful, the 5 different theme rooms look like casino restaurants! Wish they had spent more on the food than the rides & other stuff. Pizza are disappointing, good flavor but not much topping, salad bar has good selection & dressings; fried chicken, soup, vegetables are okay, except everything has a generic look & taste to it. Surprisingly, desserts are all good, including cheesecake, cinnamon roll, donuts, ice cream......Of course this place is geared towards kids, so they think food are not that important, I give them credit the restroom is clean & modern!",

    "text": "This place is a little smaller than other John's incredible pizza companies than my family and I have been to but for what it lacks in size, it makes up for in food and service. The people that work here are incredibly friendly and polite and made us feel extremely welcome. We had our sons' combined birthday party here and they have made it an experience to remember. My girlfriend was even waiting for mashed potatoes and the employee, Nique, chased her down to tell her they were ready. That's service!",

    "text": "It's what I expected for a kids pizza place. Not the best pizza, but salad bar was ok, lots of pasta and sauces to choose from, chicken legs, and desserts were ok. I liked the fact they had different rooms to eat in, we are the Disney room where the tv kept her interest. For taking a 2 year old I was pleasantly surprised that there were several games and 3 small rides that she could do. This kids play land is where I was disappointed, just a few little tykes type slides and a house, and two plastic animals to climb on. I could tell right away it was dirty, candy wrappers from the night before and a wad of gum are just the things I saw upon entering. We were there at open on our trip this day, by the way. The staff needs to be taught to clean these playhouses and slides and definitely keep the carpet clean, this room has kids on the floor. Staff needs a check list for cleaning.",
