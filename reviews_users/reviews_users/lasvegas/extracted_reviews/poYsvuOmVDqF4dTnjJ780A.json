    "text": "Yet another review to say that the customer service needs work. I came by today for a latte after finding this place on the Yelp app- it's still difficult to find, as it's in a nook of the plaza and can't really be seen from the street. I guess their exterior signage is still being developed, because right now there's just a tarp printed with \"Coffee & Waffles\".  Went in and there seemed to be some sort of lounge affect going on. I made my way around a group of women clustered near the entrance talking, perused the posted menu, then stood behind a guy chatting at the front counter for a good five minutes before the woman he was speaking to realized I was a paying customer, and said she'd help me.  I find it a little tacky that the employee (who seemed to be one of the co-owners) was not more attentive to the fact that I was waiting in line to place an order. As it is, she excused herself in such a way that I felt I was inconveniencing her.   Regardless, I ordered a skinny vanilla latte- originally planned on getting a sandwich, but it seemed this would have really been a problem to her, so I just stuck to the drink. It was tasty, even if the foam was overflowing along the lip of the lid.  Found a table of samples toward the back as I waited for my drink- the cinnamon sugar waffle and the bacon-cheddar waffle were both really flavorful, though the former was nice and crisp while the latter was more on the limp and soggy side.   Location seems like it'll be good for students, and they seem to have a lock on the niche market- doubt bistro waffles are offered anywhere else nearby. Hope they succeed, maybe I'll be back when they work out the kinks- namely waiting for the novelty of business ownership to wear off enough for them to prioritize customer service. Their product seems like it'll do well.",

I also tried the refreshing coconut cooler, delicious and quenched my thirst. I had the avocado grilled cheese, yum. My husband devoured the breakfast sandwich. To finish it up, I was impressed by the gender neutral restrooms, thank you! We will definitely recommend and bring more friends next time!",

    "text": "Tell them you're staying if you want your latte in their cup with a foam design. They didn't ask me and put it in a to-go cup. Such a bummer for me since my whole reason for coming was for a fun latte.   It was a 3 star but the menu still has me curious (half the fun) so I give it 4 stars. There are lots of vegetarian options (even a coconut bacon, bacon alternative which is shredded, roasted coconut with ketchup/liquid smoke and other ingredients that give the coconut a more savory flavor over a sweet coconut flavor. They also offer a V ice cream alternative).   (4/5) I got a small pistachio latte because of my love for pistachio ice cream. It did not disappoint in terms of flavor. What brought me here, though, were the pictures of the fun drinks with waffles on them. Visual appeal simply makes everything taste better. My latte got defaulted into a to-go cup  even though I was never asked for here or to-go. I'd even set up my spot to study and my drink came after 3 others drinks so there was time to simply glance over and see I was staying (not populated at all, regardless of the three previous orders). So if you come and want a foam design, verbalize that it's for here.   (2/5) I also got the kale chocolate chip cookie- the green cookie. I'm all about the healthy way of life but this did not make me want to stay on track. Yes, you could taste the kale. The cookie was fluffy (I'm thinking lots of flour), and had I not had my coffee I wouldn't have finished it. It wasn't sweet like a cookie, but it did remind me of a scone without the shape. I probably would have liked it if I was thinking I was getting into a scone, actually. Subbing out for larger chocolate chips would have also added to the texture in a positive way.   I asked a lot of questions, some were answered with \"I don't know\" with no intention on finding the answer (such as when I inquired about the different types of cookies) and others were answered by the guy making the drinks. I sort of felt like an inconvenience and like I should just go and sit back down because they wouldn't elaborate much without me 'pressing.' But the cashier could be new. I don't know.   I loved the menu. It looks really interesting and I love places that have originality.   The restaurant didn't have a warm, cozy feel but it was nice, nonetheless. Fun, far chalk wall mural. Actually, chalk was the main art theme. I liked it.   The music was reggae. I dig. Perhaps a little loud. Startling at times.   Definitely give this place a try, though.",

I was picturing a cute little cafe with table service. What I got was essentially a coffee shop that happened to have waffles in a strip mall. This is not necessarily a bad thing, it just was completely unexpected. I was planning on getting a waffle and egg sandwich, until I found out that they use those weird egg patty things (they don't, you know, cook an egg), so that was out. Ended up getting the Elvis, waffle with peanut butter, bacon, and banana.... of course this was good, how could that be bad?!?! I also had their specialty latte with the cinnamon that comes with a triangle of the cinnamon vegan waffle (got the latte sans vanilla syrup, you know, being healthy and all... lol).... oh ya, super tasty. Definitely a dessert. The waffle was crisp and delicious, the latte was sweet and dessert -y. The breakfast was cheap and satisfying. I would return!",

Do you like food? If not, this isn't the right place for you. Actually, you should probably go to the hospital (please see my Yelp! reviews on my favorite hospitals) 2. Do you like food that tastes delicious? 3. Do you like breakfast, lunch, and/or dinner? Do you like smoothies? Do you like coffee? 4. Are you a vegan? If not, are you an omnivore?  If you answered yes to all of those questions, then you will probably love TIABI. Waffles are cooked to a perfect texture that's not so chewy/thick that you want to die halfway through. All of the smoothies are delicious (my personal favorite are the Health Nut and the Avocado, but you do you). Breakfast, lunch, and casual dinner options. Additionally, very extensive vegan menu. Do you have an enemy? Don't tell them about this place. Do you have friends? Do them a solid and meet them there over a Waffle Macchiato and a Break The Fast sandwich.",

I came to TIABI after purchasing a Groupon and assuming it was much closer to where I live. Though we drove 30 minutes to get to TIABI, it was worth it 100%. When you walk in, you're hit with a wall of delicious smells. Then choosing your meal is nearly impossible because EVERYTHING sounds incredible. I highly recommend any waffle with Nutella on it, as well as the Tiff's Waffle Macchiato. It's basically dessert for breakfast, in the best possible way. The service is fantastic. Come, enjoy the free wifi and delicious food, and then come back and try something else on the menu!",

This is perfect for breakfast, brunch, or lunch. They have amazing coffee too. The drinks are so yummy and cute. They have a special menu in front of the cash register as well. They have a lavender vanilla latte that is so yummy and it has a soft lavender flavor. Also, I am not a big fan of honey but they have a honey creme latte that is so soft and decadent. It makes me smile and it is perfect.  The workers are also very friendly! They are also so nice and help out.  This place is serve yourself though, so they make the food and the coffee but you get the utensils and the maple syrup on a table across from where you pick up the food.

    "text": "This place really took a beating on Yelp from some of my friends. Did they have a bad day or what? Maybe they've just improved overall? I love this place so far.  TIABI has been over on Maryland near Flamingo for a quite a while now. Maybe it's just out of sight, out of mind for me (since I haven't been to neighboring restaurants like Sakana that often), but it's certainly not too far from one of my workplaces. I was able to stop by for lunch to try their menu at long last.  They seem to be having some issues with music skipping (streaming lag perhaps), but it's a pretty quiet place either way with plenty of seating for studying or just enjoying food and drink. Baristas have all been friendly so far, and it was easy to use the Groupons that I'd recently purchased.  The iced Snickers coffee ($3.35 for 20 oz large size) is appealing, even mildly addictive. Although it doesn't perfectly capture the peanut-y essence of the candy bar, its chocolate and hazelnut combo are a reasonably sweet flavor fusion that provide both fuel and happiness. Plus, it's quite reasonably priced compared to other places.  The West Coast waffle sandwich ($6.59) is an obvious choice for a savory lunch. I was pleased first and foremost by the lightly crispy and spongy, fluffy waffle that's creased so that you can just pick it up. The chicken and bacon satisfied my carnivorous sensibilities. The delicious, fresh veggies (avocado, tomato) brightened the dish up. Finally, although the sauce wasn't that distinctive alone, it served as a perfect complement. Nothing was limp about any of this.  I went for the Pumpkin Truffle Latte ($4.65 for a large) on my second visit, opting for hot rather than iced. What a treat. It's a perfectly sweet, creamy drink with a moderate spice accent, and I wish it wasn't just a seasonal item. Maybe if I just ask nicely and bat my eyes, it won't be just seasonal? It's the drink that has finally sold me on that whole annual fad.  I also had the seasonal Zombie Waffle ($6.50). This red velvet waffle has bacon cooked on the inside. I had to ask because they're not immediately visible, but using a knife (obtainable at a station near the counter) to cut and even cross-section the waffle, I saw the thin fatty strips. This dough otherwise had the same texture as my wafflewich, which means it rocked. Flavor-wise, it's actually mostly savory, with the chocolate syrup drizzle serving more to accentuate the red velvet batter than to tilt the balance toward sweetness. This also needs to be a year-round treat.  TIABI has impressed me so much on my two visits that I wish I hadn't been so apathetic before. It's a great spot for caffeine and fuel to carry you through the day, and I'll be back even after I use the last of my Groupon 3-pack.",

I didn't even know that this can be done. We also touched on a few lattes. I recommend the pistachio latte (mind blown) plus everything they have to eat. I will definitely make this a routine every time I'm in town.",

There is plenty of seating and it's nicely decorated. We were instantly greeted by the friendly staff and very helpful as to what recommendations in food. My husband ordered the West Coast Wafflewich (waffle folded in half with chicken, Tiabi sauce, bacon, avocado,tomatoe and cheese) and I ordered from the Waffle Bar a Golden Waffle with Thrifty vanilla ice cream, strawberry, powdered sugar and whipped cream. Hands down this has been the most tastiest & creamiest waffle I have ever tasted.   When in town come to Tiabi and check this place out you will not be disappointed.",

Everyone got what they wanted, the food was delicious, and made with love.  The people were super friendly and the ambiance is both casual and welcoming.  I've eaten at many of the well known places on the strip and have frequently been disappointed.  Venture out to Tiabi Coffee and Waffles, you will be so glad you did",

    "text": "What Will You Get At Tiabi Coffee and Waffle?  Tiabi Coffee and Waffle is a rather unique counter-serve waffle place in Las Vegas. Located at 3961 South Maryland Parkway, it is at the Mission Center just north of the main UNLV campus. This place has some appealing waffle options that are different from what you'd expect elsewhere.  This spot focuses heavily on unique waffle creations. These include traditional waffles as well as some sandwiches that use waffles.  A Different Approach  Tiabi Coffee and Waffle is a contemporary dining spot that offers various types of waffles. It has many vegan food options and plenty of different coffee choices. It was established in 2013 and continues to be an entertaining place for waffles.  This spot has a rather modern look that isn't too unique or different. Still, it is an intriguing place to visit. It has a friendly look to it that stands out as an inviting spot for all members of the family.  What Does It Take To Get Waffles?  The food here at Tiabi is excellent but it can take a while to get. We waited about twenty minutes to get our food. However, we assume that this is because the food is so intricate and designed with an immense approach to detail.  The people here are friendly and do well with getting orders down. They always ensure that the food is made precisely as desired. The fact that these people can work with vegan requests if desired is an attractive point too. It ensures that people can get a great waffle even if they have particular limits on what they will eat.  Great Foods All Around  The foods here start with plenty of great signature beverages. Tiff's Waffle Macchiato has cinnamon vanilla macchiato with a churro waffle and whipped cream. This has a brilliant design that is creamy and detailed.  The Stiles Java Jolt has a vanilla breve misto and vanilla with a bit of extra espresso. This adds an extra amount of caffeine to create a good taste. Various frappes and teas are all around the place too.  The creative nature of this place is particularly highlighted in the waffle sandwiches it offers. The Waffledilla features chicken, Tiabi sauce and melted cheese and an optional avocado. This is carefully made with waffle patties to establish a great flavor all around.  The classic options here are interesting to see as well. The Strawberry Kisses waffle mixes sliced strawberries with a chocolate drizzle. The Viva Las Elvis waffle has bananas and peanut butter plus chopped bacon. A bit of honey is added to create a stronger flavor too.",

No matter how many people are here, be prepared to wait a looooooong time to get any food or drink. The restaurant itself reeks of old oil or some sort of thick grease smell that stays in your hair and clothes for hours after you leave.  Took 25 minutes to finally get my Tiff's Waffle Macchiato with a kind of cold, moderately crispy churro waffle. The drink itself was sweet and tasty, and the whipped cream is quite thick. But 25 minutes for a drink?? Way too long.   10 minutes later, got the Red Velvet waffle w/ whipped cream, strawberries, and bananas. Boyfriend ordered the Waffledilla w/ avocado. Although good, it looked and tasted like something I could easily make at home in half the time.  People who came in after we ordered would order food to go and get it in 10 minutes or less. Some would then sit and eat inside. Maybe the key here is to order your food to go regardless of eating there or actually taking your food to go?  Will not be coming back due to the extremely slow service and decent quality food.",

They have a decent selection of drinks and quick eats, I'd go back if I was in the mood for waffles.  Overall the quality of food was good, the staff was friendly. The only critique is when I sat down the bench was wobbling and the table was sticky.",

    "text": "Coffee and waffles? YES PLEASE!  Came across this great spot on the Yelp app - on the hunt for something sweet. We skipped the coffee, but sure got our sweet tooth craving fulfilled with one of their delicious waffles.  They have various waffles to choose from with toppings such as nutella, banana, strawberries, chocolate and other sweets. Then they also have savory waffle sandwiches with bacon, turkey - and even egg and cheese!  We stuck with the Banana Tella which has banana, nutella drizzle, almonds and whipped cream. You can make any waffle a \"dessert\" by adding a scoop of ice cream. YES PLEASE! The waffle was incredible. I would of liked more of a \"home made\" whip cream - this one was possibly from the can - but it was still great.  We got the chance to chat up the owner and she was so nice! We asked her about the concept and apparently it started as a coffee shop - then they wanted to add some desserts and decided waffles would be a good fit - then decided to hit the lunch crowd so they added the savory waffles. Genius!  Awesomee concept - great folks working there - and a delicious product! Wish I had tried the coffee! Aw, well - gives me reason to come back to Vegas!",

Honestly my friend ruined waffles for me. She made a ton one time, 3 different flavors   The one that stands out in my memory was the cookie butter flavor. These waffles were so insanely delicious that now whenever I have waffles, I compare them to the ones my friend made and they are never as good. The other issue is I'm personally more of a fan of the Belgian variety of waffles over the eggo variety. Tiabi has more of the eggo variety, thin and crispy rather than thick and somewhat doughy. They have a nice presentation but I'll probably not visit them again.",

They have lots of table room, which I definitely like taking advantage of when needing to study and catch up on homework. Wished they stayed open longer, but what can you do? Overall, a great place to grab a bite while studying for those exams. Always leaving focused and content after coming here! :-)",

There is nothing worse then someone working at a coffee shop in the morning who hates mornings.

My only disappointment came when they were presented to us in plastic drink-ware instead of the cute little mason jars we saw pictures of here on Yelp.  Bananutella Waffle- 4/5  Came out perfect with just enough crunch on the outside and soft fluffy waffle goodness on the inside. Covered in Nutella drizzle, bananas, and sliced Almonds. It was very, very rich. I ate 1/3rd of it I had to take the rest to go. I feel like this would of been better for dessert, too heavy for breakfast for me at least.",

There's lots of chalk writing on the walls with a bunch of UNLV references and other scrabble, which gives it a local and laid-back feel. It was kinda cool but the colors get obnoxious if you stare at them for too long.  I was pretty impressed with the waffles here. I ordered a sugary cinnamon one, and my boyfriend had one of their waffle sandwiches. I think the only thing slightly disappointing was the coffee. I got a pumpkin spice drink, and the espresso/coffee they made it with tasted burnt and old.  I'd probably return here, but not for the coffee.",

Waffle breakfasts, waffle sandwiches, waffle coffees. We went here in the afternoon when it was slow; no lines and plenty of staff running around. My party ordered three food items and three drinks. The first two waffles came out in about 10 minutes. The third took 30 MORE MINUTES. The first two were done with their meals (and then drinks) before the last waffle came out. There were three staff members basically standing around looking at the waffle makers. No one looked like they were in a hurry to get our food out. There was no apologies or anything as to why the food took 40 minutes after ordering to be prepared.   The food and drink were good once they were out, but I expect a business, whose sole food item is waffles, to be able to put out items in a reasonable amount of time. I suggest they order an extra waffle maker (or dozen) so this isn't a hamper on their business anymore. I sincerely hope they fix this, for an otherwise fine cafe.",

I decided to try the sweet waffle today: banana nutella and pistachio coffee. The waffle took a while to be ready but hey, it tasted soooo good so it was worth the wait. Waffle was crispy, light and gluten free! What's not to love. Pistachio coffee was also perfect, I tasted the delicious coffee, pretty strong coffee, it smelled really good too.

We ordered Strawberry Kisses, the Breakfast waffle, a plain churro waffle, and 2 large iced twilight lavender lattes.   It took about 20-25 minutes for our lattes to be ready. That's a bit too long to wait, but we didn't mind too much after tasting it because it was delicious! Unfortunately that's where the positives end. It took 58 minutes for our food to come out. While we were waiting I could hear multiple parties complaining on the wait time. At some point they also had to deny customers because they could not keep up. There was 3 workers working but it didn't seem like there was any leadership so it was unorganized, which may have contributed to the long wait times. When we finally got the food they were not that apologetic that we had to wait an hour for 3 waffles.   The Strawberry Kisses & churro waffle was quite good and had crispy outsides. The Breakfast Waffle had good flavor but for waiting an hour the waffle was extremely soggy. It's unfortunate that the service was bad, maybe it was an off morning. Will probably come back for their Twilight Lavender lattes, but the hour wait wasn't worth it for the food.",

    "text": "I didn't think I'd be that impressed by a coffee shop that specializes in waffles and I was correct. I guess if you view it as a coffee shop first and a waffle shop second it's not so bad but I think most people that want breakfast want more options than just waffles. I tried the pistachio latte and build your own red velvet waffle with Thrifty ice cream and fruit. My boyfriend had an iced Americano and the bacon waffle sandwich.   I was surprised to see that the coffee came in to-go cups even for a dine in order and I heard the couple behind me remark about the same thing. I guess if their menu shows pictures of fancy lattes with designs in a mug, that's what I expect to get. Regardless of presentation the coffee was quite good. I asked for skim milk and assuming they still used skim milk I found the latte to be very creamy with a nutty pistachio flavor that wasn't fake or overpowering.   As for the waffles... they're just waffles ya know? My boyfriend's breakfast sandwich was pretty bland. If he hadn't added bacon to it it would have just consisted of scrambled eggs and shredded cheese. Adding the bacon added a bit of flavor but without drenching it in syrup it didn't taste like much of anything. Plus think about the texture of a waffle and scrambled eggs.. bacon is pretty much necessary for a crunch factor. My waffle was a little better, it had a bit of crunch on the edges and the red velvet was rich and gooey in the center. My favorite part was definitely the Thrifty ice cream though. I had a choice of strawberries and/or bananas for the fruit and I just got the strawberries. Overall it was a bit of a sugar overload and I can't see myself eating here very often if at all. Prices are definitely a little steep for what it really is. Not understanding the hype of this place at all.",

    "text": "I really like the concept and service at TIABI. Laid back atmosphere where you can hang out solo or with friends. There are people working on their laptops or hanging out with friends. Their specialty is their vegan waffle. Either sweet or savory they have options for both.  There is a a big board on the left when you walk in for the menu. The customer service at the ordering  counter has been consistently friendly. I've had the West Coast waffle sandwich and that has chicken, avocado, bacon, and their signature aioli sauce. I really like it, but sometimes I get it without the bacon. Their chicken waffledilla is a quesadilla made out of waffle instead of tortilla. Very cheesy and hits the spot when you're in need of comfort food. The only drawback is that sometimes the food takes a while to come out. I've tried calling ahead for pick up, but was put on hold for a while and ended up driving there instead. However, I'm never disappointed when I get my food though.   I do want to differentiate that this particular shop has a more soft and fluffy texture than a super crispy outside kind of waffle. I personally like the softer version, but for some people the waffle texture was too one noted. I have yet to try their dessert versions, but the strawberry and whipped cream seems to be very popular when I've dined in. The prices are very affordable too. Lunch with a drink will be around under ten bucks. All in all, it's a cool and casual spot worth giving at least a try. May call way ahead of time before the busy lunch hour, but it's definitely on my rotation of lunch options.",

The two owners were super sweet and Alumni rebels!!! I have not seen them in a while though :( I loved the Snickers coffee. It was not too sweet and a refreshing addition to their tasty waffles. The waffles are crunchy and a great vessel for their sweet toppings. If you are in the mood for something a lil' sweet... highly recommend this place to settle down that craving!

We had the Tiff's waffle macchiato and it come with a churro waffle, kind of reminded me a pumpkin spice latte, must've been because of the cinnamon spice the kids had the bananatella with vanilla ice cream and my partner and I shared the viva las Elvis, I will definitely be coming and we highly recommend this place! Just look at the last pic to see how much we enjoyed it!",

There were a lot of coffee options (which I don't drink) and simple substitutions are easily handled by staff. It was a clean and welcoming space to sit alone, or at a shared table. Staff were friendly, and delivered food and coffee drinks as soon as it was available. Looking forward to going back someday. Hopefully they expand to LA.",

My friend and I came here for some grub before a music festival and thought this place was unique and had great reviews. Those reviews did not disappoint.  I ordered a West Coast wafflewich and since I'm not the biggest fan of bacon, they allowed me to sub it out for ham. This one entree was freakin' amazing, and I need to come back to Vegas to eat here again. I think my friend ordered one of the sweet waffle entrees, and I'm sure that was good too but I don't quite remember.  The place itself looked nice, and the service was great. Looking forward to coming back.",

The best thing about this place is they have lot of basic stuff that you can expect at a waffle shop but then their own creations AKA Wafflewiches kills it. Their espressos and lattes are nice. More of the darkers side. Being a vegetarian, I tried the Guru burger. It was good size and I was set for the day. Try it with their special TIABI sauce.",

I tell her to forget about it, then she tells me it'll take 30 min for my order to be ready so I told her never mind and she has the nerve to give a 10% off for a future purchase which to me it was a joke.  I was not asking for a discount I just wanted the items I had paid for that were not in the bag.

    "text": "I made the mistake of discovering this place on Groupon as something new to try while visiting Las Vegas. The deal was for 3 - $8 vouchers to be used by 1 person with only 1 voucher per visit. Understood. So I go over from the Strip and plan to order and leave then come right back; then I was going to come back again before leaving town. Well I get there and they tell me I can't leave and come right back because it has to be on a different day or at least a few hours later. I tell them that is not ideal because it's a $40 taxi ride roundtrip from the Strip, plus that is not what the fine print says. They tell me it's up to them to determine what qualifies as a visit. I tell them that needed to be included in the fine print since they want to stick to the fine print. They said it's their decision and I can't leave and come back within a certain time period. ((So if I order something and decided it was really good and want another one, I have to wait a few hours before I can come get another one with my Groupon. Foolishness)) At that point I didn't want any of the food because the poor customer service and the bad attitudes of the employees made me lose my appetite. So I can't comment on how it tastes. But as far as the customer service and employees' personalities are concerned, they left much to be desired. If you don't mind crappy service then go for it. But if pleasant service is an important facet of your dining experience, then don't waste your time.",

I really love that there are decks of playing cards at every table and board games to play if you so desire.  Now for the food, my boyfriend and I asked for the cashier's opinion about what was popular and we went with four of her top recommendations. Both she and the guy in the back were super nice and helpful. I ordered the Kale Champ and one of the waffle sandwiches. My boyfriend got a hot caramel coffee (which they brought him a cold version instead of the hot he ordered, but he enjoyed it) and the Elvis banana peanut butter bacon waffles (Seriously amazing, the crispy bacon worked so well with the all the other ingredients, a must have). Everything was really delicious and despite the small mix-up we'll definitely be going back again.",

Gross waffles, I am assuming someone screwed up the waffle mix recipe that morning because if that's how the waffles taste everyday I'm truly surprised that place hasn't gone out of business yet.  The waffles just had a weird texture and an off taste. They just did not taste right. We also ordered a \"hot\" coffee but it was cold, probably had been sitting out all day. If you serve nothing but coffee and waffles you better have fresh brewed hot coffee and decent waffles but they couldn't even get that right.  Worse than the sub par food was the service, when the server came to check on us and asked how the food was I told him it was not very good and he just said \"okay\" and avoided eye contact and walked away! Wth!!! What kind of service is that?! No apology, he wasn't even interested in asking why I didn't like the food for the sake of feedback. He did not offer to call a manager over, just said \"okay\" and left... That is NOT OKAY!",

You're greeted with a smile and upon looking at the menu excitement builds as you can tell that this is no ordinary coffee shop. It becomes obvious that the proprietors Tiffany and Mae put a lot of effort into creating menu choices that are not only healthy, but delectable and unique. The coffee is wonderful and flavorful especially if one's tired of the over roasted bitterness of Starbucks and many others coffee. As far as the food goes I have trouble ordering anything other than either the hashtag breakfast sandwich or the mixed berry salad. My favorite smoothie would definitely have to be the kale champ as it is not too sweet and tastes incredible.  frequent this establishment as I feel others should as well. Oh yeah and if you're having a bad day you should pop in for an ice cream waffle. It makes everything better.",

    "text": "Tiabi is great for a lighter version of Belgian waffle plates! It's located next to Target and there's a huge parking lot. I was a little hesitant to order the Bananatella because I thought it was going to be one of those heavy hitters that would make you feel overly full, bloated, and that it would be like having dessert instead of breakfast, but it was just perfect! The waffle was light, warm, toasty, and cleanly presented. For me, the dish was a good amount of sweetness topped with banana, almonds, and whipped cream. It definitely filled me up but if you're coming in famished, you should probably check out the savory wafflewiches. The woman taking our order was super friendly and was more than welcome to give us suggestions. I can definitely see this place being popular with UNLV students because there's a couch closer to the front of the store, free wi-fi, and random decks of cards at the tables but since it's the summer right now the place wasn't crowded. I'll probably have to come back and try some of the other items on the menu!",

A coffee date with a couple of friends turned into a couple of hours of eating, sipping and go-fish.    (This place has cards on every table and when you're sitting there you can't help but pick them up and start playing card games from childhood, which was a blast.)  I ordered the smore's waffle -- which probably wasn't fair because I've made some extremely delicious smore's waffles myself in the past..  But it was quite delicious! My friend ordered the bananutella waffle (which I actually preferred to mine) and my other friend ordered a waffle sandwich + the captain berry crunch smoothie (which was bomb, but only order it if it's all you're going to have because it was dense and filling and super sweet.)   I have already been back to this place to order the Honey Cream Latte, which was amazing and will definitely have to make a point to stop by whenever I'm in the neighborhood!   The staff is very friendly and the place is inviting.",

Up the street from the Boulevard Mall, in the Target parking lot.   When I arrived I was kind of nervous because we were the only people there on a Saturday around 4pm. I took the lack of business as a bad sign, but I was wrong!! Maybe not enough people know about it?? I'm not sure, but if you aren't going to Tiabi, you are totally missing out.  As I said, this was a recon mission, so I had to order a little of everything, right?? We ordered 3 of the Wafflenuts - the white chocolate macadamia, the red velvet, and a vanilla one that wasn't listed on the menu. For waffles we got the Strawberry Kiss, but instead of strawberries we subbed bananas (on a Belgian waffle) and customized a classic waffle with blueberries and white chocolate. Everything was fantastic!! Everything was cooked to order perfectly. Hot, melty, sweet and so delicious!! I almost always get a to go box, and this is one of the few times ever that it was so good...I couldn't stop. No to go box needed.  The have lots more on the menu I would like to try...including their coffees. I am excited to go back. I, also, heard there might be ice cream coming in the near future. Fingers crossed!!  You should definitely check them out. They are worth a drive even if you don't live down that way. They are pretty affordable...$20 for everything I ordered plus a bottle of water. Portions are perfect...not too big or too small. The establishment is clean and relaxed. They have games and decks of cards on the table should the mood strike. Staff is super friendly and helpful.  I will definitely be back!",

Unfortunately, their Belgian waffle machine was down, so we couldn't try that type of waffle. Also, the drinks look yummy, but we just opted for water.

Although there is a chalkboard menu on the wall grab a menu to get the full details of the items. Order your food at the counter. Ordering was slow when I went, but hopefully will get better with time. Then find your own seat. I would recommend ordering 2 wafflewiches since they do not come with sides (besides chips) or adding items to your sandwich to make it bigger. They are petit. Here's what we ordered:  Break the Fast Wafflewich- The actual waffle is delicious. I like that it's a little sweet. It's also a harmonious texture combo- sturdy and moist. Inside were scrambled eggs, thin bacon, and cheese. The items inside were sparse and the bacon was the thin kind. The price is right (about $5), but I would gladly pay more for a fuller sandwich. I think next time I will ask for extra eggs and maybe avocado on the side.  B.A.T Wafflewich- Same great waffle housing bacon, arugula, tomato, and a delicious sauce. We also wished this sandwich was fuller. The tomatoes were great. I bet this one would be great with avocado.  Regular Coffee- I drink mine black. This coffee was a-ok and came in a to go cup.  Iced Americano- Also a-ok and definitely caffeinated.  I'll definitely be back now that I have a better idea of what to order. Businesses in this area need our support so give Tiabi a try.",

    "text": "Very solid little cafe off the strip to get a waffle and coffee fix that won't leave you broke. The creations are also pretty darn creative so you don't really lose with any choice, sweet or savory.  I went with the Viva las Elvis cause peanut butter, bacon, and honey are a match made in heaven. My only complaint (and I feel like I'm disappointing so many people saying this) was that there was too much peanut butter. It completely overwhelmed the bacon. I also had visions about adding some chocolate to this dish so I stole a chocolate chip off my brother's waffle and yes, it was 100% worth it. Also, paired it with a honey cream latte - yum!  Brother went with the red velvet waffle. He said it was pretty simple, but it was still very good. Mom and dad shared their choices a wafflezilla and west coast waffle with a fruit cup. Both enjoyed the savory/sandwich twist for their breakfast and they were also impressed with the fruit cup which featured fresh chopped fruits. Mom had the pistachio latte, which is definitely more on the sweet, not really coffee side. The only caveat was that food prep was a tad slow. Each person's meal came out one by one. Hard to have a holistic breakfast this way....but it's a small operation.   All in all, it was a delicious experience.",

It's a subtle end note that really makes the drink shine. Our Maple Bacon and Strawberry Kisses Waffles were perfectly crisp. The toppings were just enough to add some except flavors, but didn't over power the delicious taste of the waffles themselves. Overall, very impressed! Go check this place out!",

All of the ones I have tasted were superb.   They are carefully made and have REAL taste.   The potato chips are the best I have ever tasted.   The coffee is perfect.    I admire their ecological water station with real cups that are washed after each use and no ice.    With Big Agriculture producing more and more food with GMOs and no taste or flavor; with the fast food mega-chains offering caloric junk, cutting corners and showing no concern for their customers' health; and with American grocery stores stuffed with packaged products chock full with corn syrup or sweeteners, it is an earnest deed Tiabi does by offering flavorful real food.",

Coffee is good also. It's nice to be able to get good coffee and breakfast in the same place! Staff is very friendly as well. It's located near Target if you need RT supplies, so a great place to have breakfast to begin your road trip!!",

When I'm in the mood for something sweet I always go for the Tiff's waffle macchiato. It comes with a slice of their churro waffle which is perfect to enjoy with your hot or cold macchiato.

Even bakeries often sell out of their GF options or simply don't have them in stock when we arrive. When we read that TIABI had vegan, gluten free waffles, we hurried over from our hotel. She loved her GF waffle with strawberries, and I enjoyed my bananatella. I also liked the honey cream latte. They have lots of fun coffee drinks. It was hard to choose one.",

Their west coast waffle sandwich is really good. I've been tempted to try their Thai Basil sandwich, but I get nervous taking a risk because what I usually tend to get hasn't disappoint so why should I stray away from what I'm used to and already enjoy? Lol  Maybe someday when I build up the courage.  Their coconut coffee was so delicious as well. Not too sweet and not too strong. Just my cup of \"tea\"   Service is nice too. Overall a good experience every single time.",

My husband and I are both big fans of hole-in-the-wall places, so when we came across Tiabi on Yelp, we had to try it. It is a bit of a drive off the strip, maybe 10 minutes. But it is SO WORTH IT! This place is a GEM. Every time we are in Vegas, which is 2-3 times a year, we go to Tiabi every day. And pro-tip - this place is VEGAN! I'm a meat eater, but it's worth mentioning!   I've probably tried every waffle on the menu, but the Elvis waffle is my absolute favorite. Peanut butter, bacon, honey, bananas...heaven. The last time we were there my husband told the waffle goddess to create a concoction of her choice and go nuts. She delivered.   And the COFFEE!!! The coconut truffle iced coffee is liquid of the gods. I've had the snickers one as well, but the coconut truffle has my heart. It's SO GOOD!!!   The vibe of the place is really cool. Very laid-back, and it's obvious the employees put a lot of love and pride into their food.  Do not pass this place up!",

    "text": "Who would have thought having waffles as a sandwich and enjoying it with a nice cup of joe would taste so amazing. This adorable place is a central hit to all things waffle, latte, and coffee. Whether you like your waffles savory or sweet, they have something great for everyone. They have a Waffledilla, Guru Burger, Savory Thai Basil, and if you prefer to stick to the Classic way of having your waffle, they do offer Bananatella, Strawberry Kisses, just to name a few. Also they have a waffle bar where you have that option to build it your way.   I ordered the West Coast Wafflewich ($6.75). This comes with tender chicken, Tiabi sauce, avocado, tomato, cheese, and I omitted bacon. The waffle is served crispy, the tender chicken taste like its seasoned and grilled, and I really like the flavor of the Tiabi sauce. As a side note, I can't even tell these waffles are vegan. All I can taste is how savory and delicious my wafflewich is and when I dip it with a side of syrup, it makes the meal even worth ordering for another one.   Now one of the most popular Signature Drink is Tiff's Waffle Macchiato ($4.55), which is a blend of cinnamon, vanilla, and macchiato topped with whipped cream and a churro waffle. I ordered this as a regular size hot drink with almond milk ($0.75) and requested a light whipped cream. This drink taste incredibly good! I never knew there is so much enjoyment eating a crunchy cinnamon flavored waffle churro and dipping that on a nice frothy cream. It's just so heavenly.",

    "text": "Tiabi is a unique and extremely well executed concept See below for Pros and Cons  Pros From a very quirky minimalist design that makes the very industrial space feel like a cozy coffee shop.  The Coffee is very good, one of the 5 best coffee shops I've tried in Vegas and I try a new coffee shop almost every Saturday. The Waffle based food is delicious and unique The Staff is super friendly Meeting people in the social collision area of the shop makes meeting new people super easy!  Cons It's location is kind of hard to find. It doesn't have enough space to accommodate it's rush There is no bicycle parking  Overall, everything that Tiabi can control is really really well executed, the things beyond their control they've done a great job of mitigating.",

A very relaxed but nice place to go and enjoy a waffle and coffee. The Recommendations given by one of the employees were perfect. Extremely friendly staff and very polite. The Java Jolt, and Tiff's Waffle Macchiato are very delicious. As well as the West Coast Wafflewich. The price is pretty decent for the quality. Definitley will be back again soon!",

My two year old ate most of it. I also got the pistachio latte. Amazing!!!! The things I didn't like, there was only two people working so it took a long time to get our food. Each meal came out one at a time. My youngest fell asleep before his breakfast came. The other thing I didn't like was that they didn't have high chairs. That means that I can't bring my kids back. So I would say great food but not really as family friendly as I was expecting for a waffle place.",

It was the quanity and quality of your other ingredients used that were not good especially for the price.",

The girl at the counter was very nice and everything came out super fast... but it was not busy at the time. As soon as my sandwich/waffle was ready I dug right in but it was already soggy and just fell apart. Kinda disappointing but oh well, I managed with a fork and knife. The waffle was tasty on its own but together it did not jive with me.  Honey espresso was yummy, almost too sweet for my taste so likely wouldn't order again. But they have a lot to choose from.   If I come back I'm just gonna stick to traditional waffle with minimal extras on top to play it safe.",

So eat the darn waffle, and then repent by drinking blended kale. Yup, pretty much,  As we walked in, we were greeted by happy faces and the scent of warm, delicious waffles. I was very impressed by the selection of vegan goodies they offered. But luckily, im not vegan, so it was time to indulge with deliciousness. We ordered the Banana Tella waffle and sat down. They make the waffles fresh for each order so we had to wait a couple of minutes. When the waffles came out I had one regret: we had ordered one to share. And although one is actually pretty big, this is the kind of dish that should never be shared with a lived one. Its seriously good enough to break friendships and end marriages. Luckily for my husband, I had a big lunch before it, so it  wasnt so bad (the sharing, that is).  If you like waffles, GO. If you like smoothies, GO. If you like coffee, GO.  Just go. Seriously. And order the banana tella. You are welcome.",

Joe came in my office and asked if I wanted waffles for lunch, I was like that seems odd, but Joe is a standup guy so I trusted him, and I was down for an adventure after my extremely boring day so far. So we loaded up a couple cars or coworkers and we rolled on over. The inside of the place was cool, actually it was a little cold. I liked the painting of princess leia and Vader. They have a waffle sandwich named the West coast, which is what I got, mainly because I like to say \"West Coast\" in my white \"Gangsta\" accent. They have Mexican coke in \"medio litro\" sizes, that was good. Exp date on it was august of 2017, so that gives it plenty of time. I liked the music, it was like a funky sax beat that got my jiggy flowing. Jami got the Guru Burger, she said \"it's delicious\" Joe said his waffle was \"primo\" he got the strawberry kisses or something. \"The kettle chips are delicious\" - Jami. Alex said the Guru burger was \"good so far\" Jamie said the Strawberry kisses was \"really good!\" Byoungha said about the WestCoast \"it's good....real good\" In addition they had playing cards at our table, me Jordan, Alex, and  Sarah played \"go fish\", Jordan won with 8 matches.",

The smoothie wasn't icy at all and you could actually taste all the ingredients they put into the drink, unlike most places. IMO, $5.25 is a lot for a smoothie, but I would say it was well worth it's price.  I also ordered the west coast ($5.99). I was torn between the steak and egg waffle (a new addition to the menu) vs the west coast. I went with the west coast since the person at the register suggested it and I'm glad I did.  The west coast was the perfect balance of sweet and salty. The avocado didn't over power the sandwich which I feel most sandwiches do. It was definitely enough to make me full since I also ordered a side of house chips. The house chips tasted like kettle cooked mesquite bbq chips, but they season it themselves kinda like potato corner. Would recommend. We have a place like this in Cali called Bruxie's, but I'd rather come here because their items are more flavorful.   P.S. They play a variety of girl power songs from Ciara, Beyonce, Nicki Minaj, Destiny's Child, etc... lol",

Once your senses are completely overwhelmed from casino dwelling on the LV Strip, head over to Tiabi for something a bit more down to Earth: smoothies, coffee and waffles.   It sounds a lot more decadent than it really is: an honest to goodness cafe. No gimmick, no half naked servers, no gaudy decor or slots. Plain and simple good eats, drinks, wifi and everyday people.  Tiabi opens early, around 6:30 am on weekdays. Which is good because I arrived around 7:45, parched and hungry. Strawberry banana smoothie took the edge off for a few hours, then the West Coast waffle sando took care of the rest.   A few hours of normal does a body good. I headed back to my hotel feeling recharged and ready to take on the Strip again.",

At the front desk, they displayed some of their deails, like 10% off for checking in on Yelp, and buy-one-get-one-free on their classic waffles.  The place itself was a good-size hipster cafe, and the employees were all very friendly. The only complaint I had was that the service took unusually long. Our smoothies and coffees came out relatively fast, but for the three waffles we ordered, we waited about 25 minutes. Luckily, they had a few deck of cards that you can play with to pass the time.  Aside from the wait, the food was really delicious. They had a good selection of waffle dishes, and there were a couple substitions that they make to cater to vegans. Overall, definitely recommend this place if you're looking for waffles.",

They have great smoothies and a awesome choice of waffles. But definitely let them know you're vegan maybe tell them twice because I told them I was vegan and they made my waffle completely not vegan so I had to order something else and by the time I got it my boyfriend was already finished and ready to leave. :/ The Viva La Vegas is super filling and yummy. The waffles also feel very light and not heavy in your stomach! Defiantly check it out if your in town!",

It honestly didn't look like much when I got it, but the delicious taste will pleasantly surprise you. My parents got the West Coast wafflewich and the Savory Thai Basil wafflewich. Both of them loved it! I also got an iced Twilight Lavender Latte, which tastes like a lavender white mocha. It's on the sweeter side, so I personally LOVED it. However, if Starbucks type coffee drinks are not your thing, perhaps that's not the drink for you. ABOVE ALL, even if this place is a little out of the way from where you live, I still think it is definitely worth a try!!",

I added the extra shot to the drink as I'm used to 3 shot large drinks and a previous review recommended it. The extra shot made it more of a balanced taste rather than overly sweet.

My bf & I came in on a Friday at about 8:30am and we were the only ones in the restaurant at this time so we were served right away. It's cafe type ordering so you just order and pay at the register and seat yourself.   Since it was our first time, I asked the girl which items were vegan and she told me the only one was \"Viva Las Elvis\" which had coconut bacon, peanut butter and agave syrup on top. I'm not a huge fan of PB but decided to give it a try since she said it was the only vegan option. Little did I know, after I ordered I saw on yelp reviews that they do offer vegan butter to top your waffles which sort of bothered me as to why she didn't give me the heads up on that since I could've technically ordered another \"non vegan\" waffle and just customized it to be vegan. I mean I did like my waffle but it wasn't the greatest and wished I had opted for the butter pecan waffles instead but maybe next time.   My bf absolutely loved the Guru Burger and couldn't be more satisfied! We liked the fact that the patty isn't made of soy and is made of superfood ingredients that make the burger so much more enjoyable. We also got a free \"snickers\" iced coffee with check in which was also pretty good.   Overall, we had a good first time experience. The staff was friendly, I love how big the cafe is and it's a perfect place to study for students especially since it's right by UNLV!",

I asked how would I know I didn't like it if I didn't try it, and if I didn't drink it what would he do with it. He said he understands and he would save it or put it in the fridge till someone else ordered the same kind! So make sure your drinks are fresh when served and not just fresh whipped cream added on top. I think the health district needs to pay them a visit.

    "text": "Introduction: Always looking for a good coffee place. Came across Tiabi on Groupon and decided to try them out.  I must say, it was delicious.   Quality: 5/5 We had the snicker \"iced coffee\" and  the honey \"I'm home waffle\".  They were both equally good.  The coffee had the perfect sweetness and so was the waffle. However, if I must rate between the two, I enjoyed the waffle  slightly better.   Quantity: 4/5 For the price, I think it's good, but not great. Although the large coffee was plenty, I usually see that as a medium size. So fyi, in case you are considering a small. It's really good, so I recommend the large.  Customer Service: 4/5 Nothing spectacular, although there was only two parties in there including us, we were not acknowledged when we walked in like most places do with incredible customer experience.  However, they were good once we were assisted.  Atmosphere: 5/5 It was kind of cold in there, there were us and one other couple that was in the shop. Mainly because we went about 4:30 p.m. Coffee shops are not known to be busy during that hour.  The music volume was however perfect tone. Not too loud or too soft.   Cleanliness: 4/5 The place appeared a little older, but was clean and organize.  Price: 5/5 The price was good, however, we got Groupon promotions, so it made their pricing exceptional :)  Tips: You can get three $8 groupons for $14.25.  So we have two left to utilize. Will definitely be back to try out their other items.  Keep an eye out,  It's located in a plaza, so it's not a stand alone coffee shop. We almost missed it. Enjoy! You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "OMG!!! The best Waffles ever. Went here with my beautiful daughter and ordered the West Coast sandwich with house chips and a red velvet waffle with a 20 oz Coca-Cola and a 20 oz Dragonfruit Vitamin water.  First both waffles were cooked to perfection with a crisp crunchy texture and served warm fresh from the waffle iron.  The West Coast was loaded with chicken slices, bacon slices, avocado slices and tomato slices with Tiabi Sauce and cheese.   The house chips were very good with a awesome seasoning that was a little sweet and savory. I'm glad I ordered them and I would recommend that everyone must try it for themselves. You'll thank me later.  The Red Velvet Waffle was topped with of chocolate chips, hot fudge and whipped cream.   They have some great coffee drinks and other beverages to choose from.  There is free wifi and a roomy seating and study area and outlets to juice up your gadgets.  We will definitely be back for the best waffles that I have ever ate.",

I can imagine it being something similar to heaven's scent. The music isn't too loud... it could be better but some of it was decent.   We were greeted at the counter by a very nice young man. He was knowledgeable and gave us great suggestions. They have a variety of vegan options in both coffee lattes and waffles. We chose the Java Jolt and the dark chocolate lavender latte both with almond milk. They were great and I would highly recommend. Both were priced like any other coffee house in Vegas, nothing outrageous and totally fair.   We ordered dessert to go... vegan the cinnamon churro waffle with vegan vanilla ice cream. It was so amazing. The ice cream was like nothing I've ever experienced. The waffle was made perfectly. We put it in the microwave to make it extra warm and soft, since we took it to go... and it was just so amazing. I can not wait to go back and get it again. If you've never been here, I definitely recommend giving it a try!",

Got coffee orders quick, a good sign. Then we proceeded to wait like 45 minutes for our food to come out. How long does it take to toast a damn waffle and put some toppings or sandwich meat and eggs in the middle?   The service is friendly. The atmosphere for the restaurant is nice. It's laid-back and relaxed. Clean bathrooms are a plus. But perhaps the laid-backness is what caused the slow food.   We got the Green Nut (?) the super green smoothie, the breakfast sandwich plus sausage and bacon, and the western sandwich. The green smoothie tasted like what you'd expect of a green smoothie, I wouldn't really want to get it again cuz it wasn't much of a wow. The breakfast sandwich was tasty. Not too flavorful but I didn't mind it. The western was delicious and the highlight. The waffle was perfect.   3 stars because it doesn't deserve lower. But I don't think I'd come back based on how long it takes to get a WAFFLE.",

Go for extra decadence with their drinks - boyfriend ordered their tiff macchiato (comes with 1/4 churro waffle!) and I ordered their tuxedo frappe, both of which were fantastic, if a little on the richer side. We are visiting Vegas only for a few days and so far we just haven't been able to have something other than Tiabi for breakfast.

The waffles (also vegan) are crispy on the outside with a fluffy center, and slightly sweet. Probably the best waffles I've ever had, vegan or not.

The guy at the the register asked if it was our first time, and it was. So he gave us a few minutes to decide, we asked a few questions and he recommended us a few things off the menu. After we ordered, the food took no longer than 10 mins for everything to come. Plus free wifi (can't say no to that lol). The food was great, enviornment was great and the staff is great. I will definitely come back here and try the other drinks and food. I highly recommend this place.",

Waffles are light and crispy crunchy with light soft inside.   Waffle breakfast sandwich was delicious. The cheese was great.  Service: very friendly and bubbly like. Offered more dressing and asked if we needed any else a few times. No gossiping behind counter unlike most casino cafes. They seemed all very happy, adding to the light atmosphere.   Clean restrooms  Definitely going back.",

We weren't planning on eating breakfast here until the owner told us they had gluten free waffles!!! The chef thoroughly cleaned the waffle maker for 10 minutes before making our waffles. It was well worth the wait and he did it right in front of us ( the kitchen is open).   The owner is welcoming and told us they have vegan and gluten free items. I also noticed they had bakery items (from a different maker) that are gf and vegan.  I ate the wafflewich with eggs, cheese, and turkey sausage. Yummy! Best of all, The (regular) waffle was flawless: warm, crispy on the outside, and chewy on the inside. Even better dipped into the tasty maple syrup!   My boyfriend got the gf waffle. He loved  that the whipped butter was soft and spread evenly. Melted right away!",

    "text": "Waffle bar. Those two words were what initially lured me into this place. I mean, who could resist the thought of personalized-topped waffles? Add the incentive of a groupon, and I'm on it...but unfortunately, I have to say that I was slightly disappointed both times I went.  I had gone to eat here when they had opened a few months ago. I didn't particularly have an optimal experience - my boyfriend's hashtag waffles were served a little cold, and though we were the only customers there, I remember we had to wait a good amount of time for our food to arrive. I understand that this place was just starting out and just getting into the groove of things, so I chalked it up to that factor and refrained from writing a negative review. Additionally, the location is kind of sketchy, but they have no control over that really.   Flash forward. I decided to give it another shot a few months later. I ordered a dirty mocha chai and a West Coast waffle sandwich (bacon, chicken strips, avocado, tomato and cheese), which was the same exact order I had the first time around. The sandwich is what I'm giving the extra star for. It's worth a try, pretty good. It was better this time too as far as the amount of toppings go. Very filling.   The bad news: Service time is still pretty lousy. I even added the pre-tip in hopes of speeding up our food, but it was in vain. The employees are friendly, but I was expecting a smoother and more efficient delivery. They should train the people in charge of preparing the food a lot better. It shouldn't take long to make a waffle and add the trimmings. Especially if the trimmings don't require much maintenance and cooking at all. I'm all about trying small businesses and was really rooting for their success, but it was just disappointing to see that this place hasn't fully quite worked out its kinks yet.",

Compared to other coffee shops, the menu at Tiabi is reasonably priced.  My large macchiato was $4.75, and it came with a churro waffle. The macchiato was delicious and had a prominent coffee flavor while also tasting sweet from the caramel and vanilla.  I wish the churro waffle contained more cinammon sugar just like an actual churro, but it was still good.  I loved how there were playing cards at the sit down tables, and my friend and I ended up staying way longer than we expected from playing a game of cards.",

I dropped in and it smelled great. I'll admit I'm not a big fan of waffles (prefer eggs/hashbrowns kind of breakfast) but the menu of waffles looked interesting. I tried the waffle with bacon inside. When the server was getting it ready, she asked me if I wanted butter and I said no, which was okay.  At any rate, waffle was good, bacon was crisp and I switched out the sugar free syrup for real stuff. The downside was that sadly, I was still sort of hungry but decided not to order another one :) Price is reasonable. I don't do coffee, so I can't speak to any those offerings. I'll go back and try it again sometime.",

We were greeted friendly at register despite being indecisive for a few seconds. So many options, all sounded so good.  We ordered the West Coast waffle and Butter Pecan waffle with Tiff's Waffle Macchiato for $27.  delicious!!! The butter pecan waffles was a great alternative for the pumpkin (since they ran out) and I was glad to have ordered it as a random decision since I'm not weary of ordering any kind of waffles that are way too sweet. I initially ate the waffle without spreading the butter at first and actually preferred it that way. There was way too much butter once I decided to spread it around.  This place got me wishing that the 805 area has a place like this!! Loved the macchiato!! Definitely would recommend this place.  We also ordered a 3rd waffle (forgot which one, but similar to the west coast) and the same drink to take back to my sis at the hotel... Well, my 17 month old ended eating the entire waffle and loved it, too!",

Prices are low, coffee was excellent, and waffles were tasty. I had a bacon waffle and the latte with the churro waffle. Both were great. Service was quick. My wife loved her egg dish. It's about 3 miles off the strip which seems like forever and I imagine it could be if hot, but when we went early in the morning in April, we enjoyed a long walk to work off breakfast and see other stops on the strip. If you want to save some money on breakfast in Vegas definitely worth a stop.",

The problem was the flavor, or lack there of. I got the West Coast, which comes with chicken, avocado, bacon, tomato, cheese and Tiabi sauce. Somehow the sandwich was really dry and missed the flavor the mentioned ingredients should have given. The waffle had no crispiness or flavor at all. Super bland. This is my second time having Tiabi, the first was probably about a year ago and as i remember it was underwhelming as well. I will try ONE more time and see if sweet waffles are better.",

    "text": "I decided to come here on a Friday at 1 p.m. while visiting Las Vegas. The pictures on Yelp looked absolutely wonderful which made me really want to go.  Parking is free and was easy to find. The store is located in a strip mall with okay ambience, but nothing that I was too impressed with.   I decided to order Tiff's Waffle Macchiato because the combination of a coffee and waffle seemed amazing. While the churro waffle was tasty, the coffee was super gross and I could not finish it. It made me wish that I had only ordered a waffle and not gone for the coffee.  While the service was friendly, I was not asked whether I wanted my order for here or to-go and their default was to make it to-go. It was only after they tried to hand me the waffle in a paper bag that I corrected them that I would like it for here. That was sort of disappointing and I wish I was asked while ordering instead.  If I come back it will be for the waffles only and to try some of the vegan menu items. I would definitely not recommend getting coffee here.",

    "text": "Oh Tiabi.   \"To Inspire and Be Inspired.\"  My visit yesterday was definitely inspirational.  I came out here last month for the Yelp Coffee Cruise event, and have been trying to make it back since.  Yesterday, I was in the area for a birthday party a little early, so I popped in for coffee and a waffle.    Tiabi is an adorable little coffee shop, hidden away in the strip mall near Target on Flamingo and Maryland Parkway.  Before the Coffee Cruise, I had no idea it existed, even though I frequent that area all the time.   Yesterday, when I stopped in,  I took a look at their drink and waffle menu, and decided on the Twilight Lavender Latte, and the Golden Waffle.   Service was super friendly.  The cashier was polite, and the girl who made my waffle had an infectious smile.  Tiffany, the owner, remembered me from the Cruise, and said hello after I had been seated.  We chatted for a minute, and then my waffle was ready.  So...the coffee.   Light.  Flavorful.  Aromatic.   Delicious.  I may have done myself a disservice in ordering the Twilight Lavender Latte on my first time back, because I may not ever want to order another drink as long as this is available.  It is SO good...I shared a sip with a friend when I arrived at the birthday party, and her whole face lit up, it is THAT delicious.  Home Run, Tiabi.  Home Run.   The waffle.  Oh, the waffle.  The Golden Waffle is simple.  Its a light, crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside, golden, perfect waffle.  Its dusted with powdered sugar, and served with butter on the side.  There was syrup on the table, but I didn't need any, and I normally drown my waffles in syrup.    Sweet.  Delicate.  Awesome.    Tiabi, I'm so glad I had the time to pop by yesterday.  You've excelled at making me feel welcome, and the quality of your offerings is truly inspiring.",

The somewhat nondescript, simple interior had the menu on the wall.  The lady gave me a run down of the 5 Wafflewiches, point out her favorite as well as the most popular West Coast Wafflewich.   I ordered the #Breakfastsandwich and was somewhat underwhelmed. The waffle was soft but the flavor was very distinct and there was no sauce to liven it up.  I ask for a side of the Tiabi sauce, a basil based sauce that was ok, but not a compliment for the entree but probably pretty good on another entree that had Chicken.   I guess my biggest disappointment came from the limited menu selections and the fact that there was only one \"breakfast-like\" sandwich.   A lunchtime meal might be perceived differently.   To their credit they had quick and friendly service, but I would have to try something else to \"wow\" me.  Would I go back? Sure. Would I make a special trip to visit this specific place? Nah.",

    "text": "I tried this place this morning and it was a great experience. I ordered an iced Tiff's Waffle Machiatto and it was bombdotcom. Just the right amount of sweetness, just the right amount of milkyness, and just the right amount of ice. The quality of the coffee is legitimate. A+ on the drink.  I also ordered some golden classic Belgium waffles. Finally, I find a place here in Las Vegas with real waffles. Waffles are supposed to consist of a juxtapose balance of crispy exteriors and soft almost custardy interiors. These waffles had that. They were so delightful to eat that I didn't even bother drenching them with maple syrup or butter.   I would definitely go again for their coffee and 2 nice little Belgium waffles to accompany my delightful coffee. Great job Taibi! -Ozzy",

I ordered the red velvet chocolate chip waffles. Some of the coffee beverages sounded yummy but I held off from getting one. I went during the evening so it was pretty much slow but there was some what of a wait to get our food. The waffles were good but it wasn't filling enough for me. Compared to Babystacks, Tiabi was just average.",

We had the new vegan waffle burger, a caramel syrup macchiato with almond milk, a hashtag breakfast sandwich with bacon waffles, kisses waffle, and a strawberry sunrise smoothie. Everything was nom to the max (see first line). The sauce with the new vegan burger sandwich was amazing and we loved everything else.   The employees were very friendly and we loved playing cards while our food came. Thanks, Tiabi, for a great breakfast and living up to the hype! We'll be back.",

The kids were served their food & finished eating (20 minutes) before the other food arrived. I was truly floored!  The kids initially wanted to wait for our food to arrive, however, had they waited their food would have been cold.   We also ordered a side of eggs & bacon to accompany the waffles we ordered. That too was served 20 minutes apart.   The hostess/owner apologized & said their was a \"mixup\" but I wasn't impressed with the lack of concern that was given with our poor dining experience.   I know this is a new venue & only opened a month ago but sometime & effort really needs to be put into the flow of business. We came to eat as a family & that did not happen. I'm extremely disappointed.",

The two sandwiches I tried was flat out BLAND, the waffle in itself was uninspired with no actual flavor. The break-the-fast was overwhelmed by the bacon, I could not taste the cheese or egg. And the other was completely forgettable, left a \"why\" in my mouth. Why did they add two together, it tasted gross.   Maybe I'll come back and try to test out other products they sell, see if standalone items like waffles or coffee would be a reason to comeback. But don't let the hype fool you, it's a 2 Star at BEST. And that's because of how the atmosphere felt.",

The place itself is adorable and throughout my various trips to Vegas (yes, we explore off strip, weird I know), it seems like small local businesses just aren't as popular like here in Austin so I love to see that..but I digress.   Onto the yummies: The hashtag breakfast sandwich was the shit. Not too heavy but totally delicious and filling! The waffle my fiance had was outstanding! Forget what it was called but it had Nutella and pretty much blew my mind.   The owners were there and we chit chatted and they were so nice!! Wonderful food, GREAT staff, and overall a much needed break from the Vegas strip. Can't wait to try it out again in April when we go back!",

I know come here and expect to get any one of their signature drinks or waffles and it to blow away my taste buds like no other. I also know that I can see the same great attitude and customer service from anyone in the staff. They are all kind and eager to help in any way they can and are always professional. If I ever find myself frequenting this location as much as the location in the north I know I will never be disappointed which is something that few coffee or waffle or both can guarantee so well as they do. No matter where you are in Vegas do not be afraid to venture out or go somewhere so delectable that should blow your mind. I know when I see opportunity for something Fantastic I am always down. Ps. I am always excited to see the new items they have to offer. Yum!",

As she replaced the cup she said, \"We wash our hands.\" Second: When the same employee brought us our silverware, it was wet and dirty. I took them to the counter and asked for clean, dry silverware. Third: The service was extremely slow. A party of four ordered before us, and they received 2 of their orders in approx 10 minutes, and the other 2 orders approx 10 minutes later. The employee explained that they can only make a couple of orders at a time, and offered some cookies as consolation. Fourth: We got our order 30 minutes after we ordered it. I had the egg, sausage, cheese waffle sandwich. The egg and sausage were heated in the microwave and tasted like rubber. The only good things: The gentleman that made our coffees did an excellent , and the strawberries on my husband's waffles were fresh. I spoke to the manager, explained why we were there, our experience, and that we will not be back. I do not recommend this restaurant.",

Hot White Mango Tea - I was having a huge headache and getting this hot tea definitely made me feel better. I'm not usually a flavored hot tea person but this will be my togo when I'm craving a hot and healthier beverage.  Iced Caramel Macchiato - The coffee taste here is suuuper heavy - not too much of my thing, will skip this for the future.  Tropical Siena and Just Peachy Tea - they are separate teas and I've tried them both. The taste for both were a bit subtle, can live without it in the future.  Red Velvet Frappe - holy crap is it good here or what. Per me since I don't like too much chocolate, I've asked them to lessen the Cocoa and oh my, it is delish. Per bun it's probably the best we've found out here so far.  Waffle Sandwiches:  The Waffle Dilla - add the avocado. You'll thank me later.  Cheers!",

And from what I saw, they only had three waffle makers. You would expect a waffle place to have more waffle makers than just three, which probably added to the wait. Unless, they have more waffle makers hidden from view, which makes the waiting a little worse if they do. However, I suppose the waffles were worth the wait.  They are pretty cheap for a big (at least for me) sized waffle. Here in California, waffles that big cost about $9-$10 but in Vegas, they were half the price. They have a variety of different waffles to choose from if you prefer waffles or a waffle sandwich. They even have a vegan menu if that's for you. They also have a huge variety of drinks.  I'll definitely be back here again when I return to Vegas. I look forward to trying the different waffles and drinks on their menu.",

    "text": "First off, Tiabi has both a Groupon and Living Social deal. The Groupon is $14.25 for 3 $8 deals. The Living Social is $4 for $8 or $6 for $12.   The shop is in the same plaza as the Target on Maryland Pkwy. It is to the right of Target if you're looking at it straight on. The shop itself is cute with some couches and drawings on the walls. Unfortunately, that's the only good thing I have to say.   The girl at the counter did not know how to use the Living Social deal we had. After calling 2 other workers over and charging us the wrong price she had to refund the entire order and start over. Also she never scanned the app so if I were not the good person that  I am, I could re-use the deal and get $12 of free food haha. You should probably teach your workers what to do with it!  After our food was made they placed the food on the counter and called our names, however we didn't hear them and the food ended up sitting on the counter for a couple of minutes. There were four workers in the store all standing around behind the counter talking. Take the time to bring the order out guys! It was obvious we didn't hear you and it wasn't like you were busy- it was the only new order you had.  I thought it was a little rude that you would call our name out again instead of just walking it over.   We ordered the bananatella waffle and pac man waffle. The bananatella was good, but nothing I was impressed with/would want to go back for. The presentation of the pac man waffle was horrible. I hope there's a picture of it on here, because I forgot to take one. Who wants a waffle that's a quarter missing?   The dirty mocha chai sounded amazing on the menu board, but it was all disappointment in my mouth. It was just a strange combination and did not work for me.",

While we were staring at the menu the cashier asked us if we wanted help with ordering (LOVE be asked as opposed to someone just jumping in!!) he asked what my taste preferences were and offered examples, sweet, savory, etc. he then made suggestions based on our answers. We took his suggestions and we were very pleased! He was totally on point!! I also had the coffee of the day, Guatemalan. Smooth and robust! Not bitter like another coffee place we all know and love ;) ! I cannot wait to come back try a few other items! I definitely want to try their Kale smoothie next, sounds divine!",

I would always go to the target in the same plaza and Sakana sushi right next to it, so I always saw Tiabi's sign... I just never actually went in until a few weeks ago! Since then I've been addicted and wish I walked in to try it sooner!  So far I've tried the Break Your Fast, Hashtag Breakfast Sandwich, Tokyo Sandwich, Guru Burger, and the churro waffle as well as the Honey Cream Latter, Lavender Latte, and my favorite yet - the Pistachio latte!! I am seriously addicted.   Needless to say, customer service is amazing. The staff are all so welcoming and kind.   As for the food.. The way they make their waffles is so different than I'm used to. They're thinner than typical fluffy waffles, which give their sandwiches the perfect crunch and texture! I assumed the waffle sandwiches would be soggy, but they weren't at all. Also, for the dessert waffles, the waffles have the perfect texture. While the outside is crispy, the inside is still quite fluffy despite how thin it is! Specifically for the churro waffle, the cinnamon sugar was not at all too strong, it was perfect.. Not too sweet and not at all lacking flavor. Also don't be shy about trying out any of their waffle sandwiches, at first I was skeptical because I've never tried a waffle sandwich, but each one I've tried have been really good. Tiabi puts flavors and items that really compliment each other. I don't even know what their Tiabi sauce consists of, but it's a great flavor in many of their items.  Okay now for the drinks... If I had to single out my ultimate favorite Tiabi menu item I would have to say 100% the PISTACHIO LATTE. Hahaha. The staff must think I'm crazy because I've been coming back so many times for that drink. I get it hot with soy and ahhh it's literally heaven. It's so good that I make any of my friends around me to try it and each one of them were in love too. It's so silky with that perfect flavor of pistachio - seriously spot on pistachio! I have also tried the Lavender Latte and the Honey Cream Latte, which are good as well, but no where near the pistachio latte! Hahah  So by my review I think it's only obvious that I'm in love with this little whole in the wall and would recommend anyone to stop by. Aside from their food and drinks options, the little cafe itself is so adorable!! The decorations are cute and it's so cozy to do homework/study or even hang out with friends. Even though it's a bit small, they actually have plenty of tables/seats and even a cozy couch! Plus each table has a deck of cards and they also offer of board games for people to play as well. Awesome place, great food/drinks, with a lovely staff :)",

This past weekend, I took my cousin who was visiting from So Cal to try out the food/coffee. It was my first time seeing the other workers at the shop..  I was shocked to experience a customer having to clean a table for her and her family  when it clearly is not a customer's job to do so. The customer asked a worker for a wet rag so she can wipe down a table that had not been cleaned and still had dishes from the last customer who sat there. Four stars because the worker actually handed her a wet rag. Wtf who does that?   Then, not too long after that, I experience an angry customer storm out because nobody was at the cash register taking orders. C'mon guys, get it together.",

Unfortunately, I can't eat the food there because it's not gluten free, so my review is based upon the coffee I got. My friend and I decided to come here because it was a local coffee shop and it wasn't Starbucks. Not a fan of their coffee. Tiabi's coffee selection was pretty good but their waffle selection was better. They had creative coffee drinks like the Jolt and the Snicker's bar which I got. My drink was ok...it a little more on the mocha side than I would've preferred but my friend's drink was amazing. I would definitely go back and get the Jolt next time I'm in Vegas. Definitely check this little coffee shop out. It's got a cool concept going on and who doesn't love waffles?!",

The second time, I had a Red Velvet frappe, which was amazing and a sandwich. The sandwich was my least favorite item. I don't know if it was the batter used for the waffle of the sandwich or the fact that it took 20 minutes to be served the sandwich, but I was not pleased. I would recommend this place, especially the Groupon if you plan on being in the area for a few days. I do suggest more staff to accommodate the orders.

I didn't like the sauce at all, and it just wasn't anything special at all. I think it was around 6 bucks, however I also got their pistachio iced coffee and LOVED that. My friend got a regular waffle which just tasted like a waffle lol & got the peach tea which she said tasted like water but I thought it tasted good. So overall good place if you think waffle sandwiches are cool and you just want to try one but don't expect anything outstanding.",

I absolutely love it if they were open longer I would be spending more money there than waffles are simply amazing tasty sweet and just hold off we should be they make their own syrup with some funky way and it's delicious always asked for extra encourage them to make bottles to sell. My favorite thing about this place is the black lemonade also known as charcoal lemonade. It's literally black and it's delicious anyone I'm way as I put drive-by I instantly think of them and have to stop so they can try it and they all love it, I wish that they came in different sizes but at this point I'm just glad that I discovered it.

Parking was a bit of a tight squeeze as this location is crammed in with other small businesses next to Target, but the restaurant itself was quiet and laidback.   I decided to try the Red Velvet frappe, which the employees upgraded to a large for me for free because it was my first time! Nice! The frappe was delicious but a little too sweet for me to drink the whole thing.   Now that I know where Tiabi is and have had a good experience with the employees, I definitely want to come back and try the waffles and other drinks.",

    "text": "Even though I'm only giving Tiabi 3 stars, I'll be back. Why?  -The prices are fair -the atmosphere is clean, welcoming, and work friendly -the employees are extra helpful -the food is just okay  While the waffle alone is tasty, there's nothing extremely unique about it. And when put in sandwich form, the only unique thing is that it's sandwich stuff....inside a waffle. If you're expecting to be full, you may need to order another menu item as well.   Here's what I've had: -Golden waffle- tasty basic comfort food -Vegan Tiabi Waffle- no difference in taste/texture so also tasty -West Coast Wafflewich- bland and not filling  -Tokyo wafflewich (i think that's what it was called. pretty much chicken, lettuce, and special dressing)- bland and not filling -Avocado Dream Smoothie - not my jam -I had a really delicious Coconut/Lime drink not listed on their menu online  Like I did state before though, the atmosphere is top notch. Everyone is warm, friendly, and very helpful when it comes to making food decisions. The other day I was there to pick up the golden waffle and I was kindly offered syrup, utensils, a back, all with a smile :-D The service definitely makes up for the okay food, and I'll probably just stick to ordering things on the sweeter side as opposed to the savory (bland) sandwiches.",

Despite living in the area, and walking as my primary mode of transportation, I hadn't noticed this place before as it is tucked away on the East side of the Target shopping center.  What a delightful find!  This corner of Las Vegas is not known for it's culinary delights, and Tiabi Coffee & Waffle is a gem.  We ordered a nutella, banana, and almond waffle which was delicious, and my constant companion ordered some sort of coffee.  Honestly, I'm not a huge coffee drinker, but my constant companion didn't seem overly awestruck by the coffee.  The waffle was delicious, though, and the waffles at the tables near ours looked equally scrumptious.  I look forward to slowly eating my way through the entire menu in future visits.  I definitely recommend as this as one of the better breakfast places in the immediate area, and the waffles beat any of the waffle/crepe places I've eaten at on the Strip.  Definitely worth moving off the Blvd for a better breakfast meal at a much better price.",

Which to me is silly.  We ordered the white macadamia waffle nut which was good but they put the toppings on top, not inside the batter which would've made it better. The toasty Tokyo was good along with the waffle club.   The groupon and punch cards are a nice touch.

I thought I walking through heaven, this is intense.    These guys have a great list of waffles ranging from sweet to savory. My favorite sweet waffle is the Vivas Las Elvis Bananas, peanut butter, chopped bacon and honey on a Belgian waffle. Vegan version-sub bacon and honey for almonds and agave.  I believe the place stands out for the Wafflewiches.   The West Coast wafflewich is chicken, tomato, avocado and bacon in between a toasted waffle. The lightly crunch with the saltiness of the chicken and bacon combination is over the top. Definitely something you must try!  On top of that they make fabulous coffee too, complements the food. They carry all types of coffee you would expect with few specialties the one I'm eager to try is Tiff's Waffle Machiato; Cinnamon vanilla latte, whipped cream and caramel sauce and served with a churronimo waffle on top.   The customer service there outstanding!!  Mae is a delightful person and shes cool to have conversation with. I was fortunate to have similar food interests with her as far as finding new things in town to eat.   I'll definitely be going back!!",

They were hesitant 'cause they hadn't been here before and were expecting to to one of our usual brunch places, but they ended up being extremely happy with the experience. Customer service was awesome. After greeting us, the cashier noticed that we were probably new to the place, so he told us a little about the ordering process and menu (regular items, faves, and seasonal specials). Pretty chill and nice guy.  The sister ordered the Halloween-themed menu for a waffle and a cold latte. Mom ordered a Halloween-themed hot latte with a West Coast Wafflewich. I ordered a cold Chocolate Coconut with a West Coast Wafflewich. Hahaha... The sister liked her waffle and her drink, but she wished she had ordered the same wafflewich as us. It had a pretty amazing sauce, and the ingredients tasted as fresh as can be. I will admit that I wish I had their latte though. Don't get me wrong 'cause I liked my drink, but I tasted more chocolate than coconut, and I'm looking for a balance.  The cashier also kept making sure we were okay as I got the food whenever it was ready to be picked up from the counter. He also happened to be the busperson, nice enough to pick up after us when we were done. Sorry sir... I'll be sure to put our stuff in the bucket thing on the side when we're done. Thanks though!",

It truly stole the show. However, my desert waffle (kisses)looked 10 times better than it tasted. The waffle was way too crunchy.   Needless to say, my overall experience was fantastic. I had very little wait time to receive my food. The staff was nice and always smiling. The place was clean, cute, and comfortable. It really wasnt with complaining about the overcooked waffle because at that point I was pretty full. To full to eat a perfect one.  Definitely go check this place out if you are a Lesley Knope!",

We ended up buying the Groupon because we knew we would be back for the remainder of our stay :)  You walk in & the menu is to the left.  I love how it's set up, cafe & you can see them making the food. They take your order & ask for your name (they will call you name when your order is ready)  The FOODS: - Lemonade: So yummy! Sweet, just how I like it! - Tiff's Waffle Macchiato: THE BEST DRINK EVERRRR! lol. It comes with a waffle that is dusted with cinnamon sugar, it's messy but worth the mess. So yummers! - Pac-Man Waffle: Exactly what it sounds like. Pac-Man shaped waffle with blueberries & raspberries as the thing that Pac-Man eats. Lol. Super cute! - Vegan Wafflewich: Tomato, spring mix, avocado & Tiabi sauce toasted. Pretty much like a salad in a waffle, sandwich styled. Sooooo good! I ordered this with the Macchiato every time I went here.  The employees are AMAZING! They remembered us & they're super friendly.  I totally recommend this place, RECOMMEND, RECOMMEND! You will not be disappointed!",

They're smiling, genuine, often funny, and it always feels like they really like their product as much as we do. The only downside: weekend mornings, like many breakfast spots, get busy, so service slows down a little and seating can be difficult to find if you're a group of 2+  Food: I've yet to have anything that I am not pleased with. My favorite is the churro waffle with ice cream (breakfast of champions, obviously), but even a plain golden waffle is pretty great. Simple, but quality taste. It's even better that they have options for dairy-sensitive peeps, and all your vegan friends.",

The menu is impressive with a lot of options. You can have breakfast or lunch, I opted for breakfast. I had the Viva Las Elvis waffle (peanut butter, bacon, bananas, and honey) and it was pretty good although I could of done without the bananas and I added maple syrup. Others in the group seemed to enjoy their meals. Due to the small size of the place and how popular it seems I did notice that there were several people who came in but left because of the lack of seats. I am not sure if I would come back again just because of the location. It is a little farther than I would drive just to have a waffle but if I was in the area I would go back.",

    "text": "I wanted to pick up some morning macchiatos, so my friend suggested I try out Tiabi. I was greeted by the friendly cashier who was open to answering all of my first time client questions. I ordered two regular caramel macchiatos and also received a macadamia/caramel Lolly waffle for checking in. The macchiatos barely had a caramel taste, but did showcase the fresh coffee it was made with. Definitely better quality and more refreshing than any chain coffee shop. The Lolly waffle was satisfying but had an awful amaretto after taste and was undercooked in the center. If they gave their waffle maker a good scrubbin' and ditched the almond tang, I think the lolly waffle could have a chance to be great. Overall, the customer service was friendly and coffee was tasty, but the lolly waffle and cleanliness of the establishment need improvement.",

    "text": "Ok let me start off by saying i absolutely love this place super offbeat in the best possible way, the quirky decor and i love the huge chalk wall the message is totes me. Right away when you step into the doors you feel relaxed and welcomed. Between the chill atmosphere friendly staff you never want to leave, bonus they have playing cards on the table to entice you to stay a while. Perfect for an after work chill spot or rejuvenate after a long day of shopping!  The prices for the portions are redonculous! Averaging about $6 buck. I got the Banatella Belgium waffle and i know you can see my face but its covered in drool! the waffle is crispy on the outside and fluffy warm goodness on the inside i had mine topped with a scoop of Thriftys (yes i said Thriftys) ice cream and my waffle stood up to the scoop the bananas, delicious Nutella drizzle and almond slivers without ever getting mushy! My friend got her own creation (she's a bit of a mad scientist) She had the traditional waffle with chocolate chips, strawberries and caramel and she had no complaints. I will definitely be back hope to see you there!",

Seriously, the woman behind the counter was even moving slow, no sense that people might be coming to her food establishment because they are hungry. And - the reason for 1 star- I could see her work because I was facing the counter, she was handling all the food with her bare hands. Picking up waffles, slicing strawberries, AND taking cash, answering the business phone, texting on her cell phone, never putting on gloves to handle food AND never washed her hands. Disgusting, I won't be back.",

    "text": "I've gone here twice now after buying a Groupon worth $8 each for three visits. My first visit was early in the morning on my way to work and I decided to try one of their lattes and salads out. I ordered the green tea latte to drink there and the kale salad to eat for lunch later on. The green tea latte was very good. The size was reasonable and the price is what's expected even without the Groupon discount. The kale salad was also very good, decently proportioned and reasonably priced. The lady that was working there was very kind and helpful. It's good to say that my first experience there was rather pleasant and I was excited to drop by again to try the waffles.  I came in the second time with my boyfriend so that we could both try the waffles. I was looking forward to purchase the red velvet waffle since red velvet is one of my all time favorite flavors lol. After ordering, I sat down and waited for our waffles to be done. I noticed an uncleaned table the table over us. This table was not cleaned the entire time we were there. Now, I used to work at a food establishment and I can be very understanding in certain situations. One, the place wasn't busy. There were probably 4 people eating including us with a few customers coming in to order. Two, there were three people in the back because I counted 2 guys and 1 lady. One of the three could have easily cleared out the table the entire time I was there. It's just professional to keep your establishment clean. The workers seemed rather distracted and too busy talking to each other rather than checking the dining area for mess.  We finally got our waffles after 15 minutes or so. I feel like that's rather a long wait for just two small orders of waffles. I ordered the red velvet one (of course) whereas my boyfriend ordered the regular golden waffles. We both agreed they were good after finishing them. They only gave us two waffles per order and you'd have to pay an extra $2 for another one. But for the price, you get what you paid for so it was fine. However, on the website's menu, it says that you get more with the waffles like bacon and eggs. This is very misleading because I did not. It doesn't say on the menu at the store so I wasn't so surprised when I got my food. I just think that the website menu should be updated so that future customers are not mislead.  Overall, the waffles were good, the coffee was good and the salad was good. The customer service may need a little work however.",

Hashtag waffles - I have to assume they were excellent.  The kid devoured both of them in addition to the fruit toppings they came with.  This was the first time ever she finished an adult sized meal by herself!  Hashtag breakfast sandwich - This was good - the standard eggs and sausage.  If it was a runny sunnyside egg, that would have been much better.   I'd probably pass on this one to get a...  West Coast Wafflewich - now this  was a good combination of flavor and texture.  Put bacon and avocado on anything and you have a winner.  The sample of strawberry kisses was a nice way to end the late lunch.  I think i prefer the round crunchy waffles over the thicker style just because they retained their crunch.   But the coffee will definitely bring me back the next time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "I found this place randomly about a year ago when I was craving some breakfast food on the way to UNLV. Just a quick search for \"waffles nearby\" and I came across this lovely gem, and boy, I am glad I did! I've come here often enough for the staff to recognize me and have tried a number of things off their menu (and there's still plenty more to try!). I've recommended this place to people and have brought friends and family here, each trip ending up in a generally positive reaction the the food, atmosphere, and service. The waffles and drinks offered here are numerous and delicious. From savory wafflewiches to sweet treats, theres something for just about anyone. The most popular item amongst the people I've brought here is probably the West Coast wafflewich or the Bananatella waffles. But if you can't find anything tempting on the menu or can't decide, you're welcome to create your own. And that can be anything--drinks, waffles, sandwiches, salads--if you can think it, they'll make it for you. Just to prove it, my boyfriend decided one day that adding chicken to their Bananatella would be a great idea (he's an interesting one). And while our server found it an odd request, they fulfilled it anyways. (Surprisingly, it didn't turn out that bad!) For the less daring, my personal favorite is a customization as well: the Strawberry Kisses waffle with bananas, paired with the Snickers iced coffee. As for the place itself, the atmosphere is chill and welcoming. They have a nice rotation of music playing and a deck of cards on every table. The furnishings are quirky; tables with mismatched chairs, antique-style lights, and plenty of photographs and waffle-and-pop culture inspired paintings on the walls. It's a perfect place to eat and chat with friends or to catch up on some studying while sipping on some coffee. The servers are nice and friendly, always up to explain the menu and the new, seasonal items they're promoting at the counter (ex. Egg Nog Latte at Christmas-time or the Pumpkin Spice Waffle during the fall). The downside is that it gets pretty busy in the small space during peak lunch hours, and service can begin to get slow. The place isn't usually meant for a take-out and run, it's definitely better suited for people willing to sit, eat, and chill. I definitely recommend this place to the Leslie Knopes of the world. In other words, it's the perfect place for a waffle-lover with time to chat.",

Swapping bread out with Tiabi's waffles didn't really change the overall taste of my breakfast sandwich, which contained eggs, sausage, and cheese. Their waffles aren't very flavorsome alone. I doused my order with srircha.   Despite my table's seemingly simple wafflewich orders, we were left waiting for our food for an unreasonably long time period. There were only two people working in the shop, sharing the responsibilities of taking orders, preparing and carrying out the food, and attending to guests. Needless to say, the service was definitely lacking. One of the owners actually asked my friend and I to wait before ordering, but she completely left us hanging. There was a moderate amount of people in the shop, but it wasn't terribly busy.   By the end, I don't think anybody in my party was super impressed with their wafflewich nor their wafflnuts, which tasted super doughy and undercooked. However, all of our meals were savory. Tiabi's sweeter breakfast choices might be a better option when ordering.",

Tiabi gives you the option of the classic waffle (thin, round waffle) or a Belgian waffle (thick, square waffle) for the sandwiches. The classic waffle reminded me of the one at Bruxie, but the quality and service were lacking.   I ordered the West Coast sandwich and it was decent, but I felt like it was lacking flavor and thrown together a bit sloppily. I also got the red velvet wafflenut and it was super sweet, doughy, and just seemed like it wasn't fully cooked. There were only two people working, so it took us about ten minutes to order and another 20 minutes to get our food. For the amount of customers that were there, they definitely would benefit from having another employee.   Overall, cute place, vegan friendly, but they just need to work on their consistency and their service.",

It is two square belgian waffles topped with whipped cream, sliced almonds, and Nutella. The waffle is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.   I am taking off two stars because the interior is unappealing. The decoration does not look good, the paint color is unappealing, the furniture is mismatched, the table looks old and dirty (even though it was clean).

They stopped by our table and shared with us that they were UNLV alums (go rebels!) and friends who decided to open up this cute spot together!  Since their opening, I've tried plenty of their menu items. With my go to being the West Coast. It's savory and refreshing (thanks to the avocado). Other notable favorites include Kisses and the Red Velvet Waffle for those with a sweet tooth.  The only thing about this place is that you never know what to expect with service. There are times when it would be swift, friendly, and efficient. You are going to be welcomed with a bright smile from the cashier and get your order in a reasonable time. But there are times when you are greeted with a blank, cold stare as if you've obviously interrupted them with their cleaning and get your order after a longer than usual wait.  Do yourself a favor and if you are return guest, do a call-in order. You wouldn't wait as long and you have more time to eat and less stressing.",

Right when we came in, they greeted us. Since it was our first time here we took a while to choose what we wanted.  I ended up ordering a West Coast. It was okay! I wish they put more chicken. The cheese melted with the waffle which made it taste good! I also ordered a honey cream latte. I'm no coffee person so I can't tell what coffees are good but my friends and boyfriend said it was \"really\" good. The last thing I ordered was a Red Velvet. I personally liked it because it wasn't as sweet. It kinda bothered me because it was so perfect... (Hahahaha). I had a weird urge to stab the holes... When I'm near Vegas again, I am definitely coming back!   Stars for the customer service! There was one lady who was kind of rude but then two other employees took her place right away when they saw our faces from smiles to me and my friend looking each other giving \"She's so rude\" look. (Yes, it's a thing haha.) Usually they would charge for Avocado and Chips but they just gave it to us for free with a smile. Thank you again! :D",

The Baristas are very engaging and accommodating to your needs. The owners are very passionate with Coffee and inventive with their food items that they offer.   **A little FYI, I'm good friends with these former green apron workers for years. If your interested about their background ask about their story and how they come to have a coffee shop. Personal favorite is Stiles Java Jolt and West Coast Wafflewich, must try items along with Tiff's Waffle Macchiato and Coconut Truffle Iced Coffee drinks. Ambience is pretty much straightforward with emphasis on artwork and pictures of random travels of the owners with a hipster vibe.   Cool place to hangout with friends and expect a lot of millenials and tourist here since it's near LV Blvd.",

If you're a visitor to the city, it's worth the (very quick) drive to make it here. Much tastier and less soggy than Bruxie on the Strip.",

When you order, you are looking at that filthy floor, filled with food remnants, looks like it hadn't been cleaned up since last night. It turned my stomach inside out. The waffle machine was filthy. So was the counter. There was no clean silverware. When we asked for some, the guy in the back wearing plastic gloves (who was just carrying a bucket of dirty plates) cleaned a knife and handed it to me holding it by the blade while wearing the same disgusting gloves! The garbage can by the door was gross, drips all over, what a way to be greeted.  There was no plastic glasses by the water fountain. That's what happens when you let a place be run by kids. No one cares and no one has any clue about food safety. If the health department had walked in there today, they would have had a field trip.  Oh, and the waffle we got served had a piece of crushed avocado under it. Gross. The coffee I was given had a cardboard sleeve with a bunch of grease stains on it and finger stains. Seriously!!  Gross.  It's a shame bc the waffle was actually decent. But the owner needs to start getting his/her act together or this place will close down in no time...",

Maybe you just need a latte and a place to set down your laptop, they have plenty of tables and space for you to do that!  The employees are kind and take care of you promptly. They have fun there and it's nice to see an establishment where the employees enjoy working together!",

Their signature drink is Tiff's Waffle Macchiato and it's really good! Plus it includes a mini churro waffle to go with it.  I've had their Thai Basil sandwhich and it's great! Their Tiabi sauce is savory!  The avocado grilled cheese and west coast are both delicious as well. I like to get the tea latte and every time it's a hit.   I've been coming here for quite some time and  I always leave happy knowing the food and drinks were delicious and service is exemplary.  They off BOGO 1/2 off on Wednesday's and offer student discounts.   The place is clean, prices are fair, and waffles are wonderful.    Go for this local gem. You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "My friend and I came to TIABI because they had good Yelp reviews and it seemed like a quick place to grab a vegan-friendly breakfast before I took her to catch a flight. Let me start by saying that my food was actually pretty good - I had one of the (non-vegan) waffle breakfast sandwiches and a pistachio latte - my friend thought her waffle was a bit overcooked and also ordered a hot tea.   Although it was in no way under the restaurant's control, a health inspector stopped by just after my friend and I had ordered for a surprise inspection. This seemed to be a fairly standard visit to someone who used to work at a coffee shop and had encountered health inspectors myself, and in no way a reflection of poor practices. It was however a bit disconcerting that the staff seemed to fly into a complete frenzy and totally disregarded the customers in order to deal with the inspector.   My friend and I sat for about 20 minutes without receiving even our drinks; at that point we asked how long it would be because my friend had a flight to catch and were told about 5 to 10 minutes; we proceeded to wait for another 10 to 15 minutes without observing any action in the open kitchen, at which point we asked again how long things would be and were told probably another 5 to 10 minutes. In the meantime, we saw people who had arrived after us receive their food.   When our breakfast fare finally did arrive, we had to get it to go and rush to the airport. Fortunately, my friend did make her flight, but at what cost?",

WAFFLE: I am a big waffle fan and usually of Belgian specifically light and fluffy, not too heavy. This place had thinner waffles, not belgian, but I liked the texture of them. Because they were thinner it wasn't heavy, but if it were a Belgian waffle it would've been quite heavy. I had a churro waffle which was pretty good but a little too sweet for me... I dusted off most of the sugar cinnamon seasoning. I don't really have much of a sweet tooth, not sure why I ordered it. Retrospectively, I should've ordered the red velvet. I am a little sad they don't have sides like eggs or protein selections available either, but that would definitely require a bigger restaurant. It's more of a snack or light brekkie.  What I didn't know was that they're vegan, which I'm not much a fan of vegan and gluten free foods, I couldn't tell the difference.   SERVICE:  pretty fast about 10mins. They give you your waffle order and leave the strips on the counter for your ease of access.   RESTAURANT/SEATING: tiny restaurant longer than it is wide, however still can seat parties of 6. They do have a bathroom towards the back",

The calm & graciousness of his soul really exudes from him from the very first words that proceeded from his mouth. The experience of being sereved by him was a delight within itself, even before we received ANY food or drink! Once the drink were ready they were very cold and both tasty with natural herbs (from the Citrus Mint) and beans (from the coffee w/Dark Chocolate). They both were hitting the spot! Afterwards, the food begin to arrive...first, the Avocado Grilled Cheese! Ping, Pang, Pow...it knocked whatever idea we've had for a grilled cheese sandwich, \"OUT THE PARK!\" The \"just right\" sweet flavor of the waffle combined w/the avocado and basil special sauce as well as cheese, was a perfect combination which provoked a symphony of taste throughout the palate! The other Waffledilla sandwich was not as tasty w/an AWESOME waffle still until Jay gave me some of honey sarachi sauce on the side, which elevated the sandwich to what was needed. Oh, oh, OH...dont2 let forget how awesome and \"should be bagged\" were their homemade crinkled chips were...just perfect seasoning w/salt!  This a \"Gotta Go To Place!\" Will definitely return!",

Being vegan, it's extra difficult to find interesting breakfast food, especially on the strip. On this particular trip to Las Vegas, I had already had oatmeal several times, and I was ready to just skip breakfast at this point. Fortunately my friend found this place and off we went on a waffle adventure.   I was super excited at how many vegan and gluten free options they had. I ordered the Thai Basil waffle sandwich with a gf waffle and veggie patty. The flavors were on point, DH even liked it. He got something that looked meaty so I didn't even examine it. His feedback: \"It was good\" He had more rave reviews for the Pistachio Latte. I ordered the Waffle Late with Almond Milk and it was pretty tasty. I recommend asking for it less sweet if you don't like your coffee drinks super sugary.   The whole group (there were 5 of us) enjoyed their waffle sandwiches and we decided we would definitely come back on our next trip to Vegas. Yay for vegan breakfast options!",

Unfortunately for this place I had left and had to throw the coffee away. Ordered a Medium Drip coffee to go to take to UNLV. They had made it really fast and to order which was pretty cool I thought, speedy service and fresh coffee will make me happy. When I had a sip it was anything but pleasant.   The coffee was lukewarm at most. When I make my coffee at home its right around 185-195 Degrees during its brew time in my siphon Coffee Maker. So it was a bit surprising that it was so almost cold. When I drank it my taste buds were shocked at how sour it was. It was definitely under-extracted. If you've had a bad espresso shot that was sour, just imagine a whole coffee sour. Absolutely horrible. Unfortunately I had already left and couldn't really go back. I ended up taking a few more swigs out of it and throwing it away due to how sour it was. For a place that has 'Coffee' in the name I was really hoping they wouldn't have messed it up so bad.",

The strawberries were really fresh. I probably could have just ate those and been happy. The waffle itself was not very memorable. It's flat, not fluffy. I'm not sure if it's a special kind of waffle I'm not used to or just happens to be the waffle iron they use. The lavender latte was unique.

It's a nice little spot and the owners have really tried to change up the place and make it unique. As far as seating goes, there was were plenty of people when we arrived, it was about noon. My sister in law had to go snatch a table once people started to get up. The menu is simple and creative, you can even create your waffle (waffle base, toppings). I ordered the Strawberry Kisses (fresh strawberries, chocolate drizzle and whip cream, I added bananas). My bf ordered the Breakfast Sandwich, same as my brother and my sister in law ordered the Churro Waffle. The iced coffees were good and strong. My waffle was delicious and mouthwatering. The breakfast sandwich was a surprise. Let's say looks are deceiving, it looked simple but it just melted in your mouth with all the ingredients. The Churro Waffle was good but not a breakfast meal, more of a dessert. It was sweet and the ice cream on top completed the duo. Highly recommend if you're looking for something different and unique. The bathrooms were also nice and clean with a bit of modern decor.",

When you walk in it is a very cafe vibe-not so much coffee shop. The decorations are super cool and there is a lot to see inside this small place.  They have a nice variety of waffles both regular and vegan. I think this is a good choice for breakfast and even for vegans and non vegans so they can eat well together. They also have meat waffles such as bacon, fruit waffles and tons of other tasty choices.    They have a hot lavender Infused latte which I loved, and many options for cold coffee as well. If in the area its a great choice for a nice homemade waffle and a good coffee.",

    "text": "Bought the groupon so I had the opportunity to check out this spot 3 times. Suffice to say, after all 3 visits, I thought that it was OK.  I guess that this place focuses mainly on waffles used in a traditional sense, with sweet toppings, as well as savory preparations, such as using a pair of waffles as a bun for a sandwich.  First off, I would say that using the groupon was pretty difficult here. I had 3 of them, good for $8 to spend. The waffles ranged from 5-6 dollars, and the coffee drinks ranged from 4-5. You do the math. I think it would have been better to offer 2 $5 for $10, instead of the 3 $4 for $8.  The good news first. The fillings and toppings they use are great! For the hashtag breakfast sandwich, the egg and turkey sausage was cooked perfectly and well seasoned. For the Tokyo sandwich, the chicken was moist and tender, and the veggies were very fresh. The sauces they use are well balanced, the sweet ones aren't too sweet, and the savory sauces are packed with flava!  The bad news. I hated the waffle. I've tried both the thin waffle they use for sandwiches, and the thicker Belgium style one. My conclusion is that I frankly don't like their waffle recipe. They both had a strong metallic taste that resonated the more I ate it. This happens when I eat biscuits or other quick breads that use too much leavening, such as baking powder. This may be the culprit. The interior of the waffle is pretty doughy as well.   Also, it took a little longer that I though it would to receive my order. On my last visit, I ordered a waffle sandwich, lolly waffle, and small hot coffee, and I timed them at 16 minutes. It would be better than to rather than to stack 3 separate customer orders at the same time, it's better to do one order at a time, because the 2 other people received their orders 1 minute after mine was ready :/  The coffee is ok but pricy for the portion size. The employees are nice and friendly, but also they seem to be easily distracted.  Wasn't the worst waffle, but not the best. Slightly middle of the pack is where I would put them. If you are in the mood for a savory waffle sandwich, this place would be the place to go because no one else in town is doing it (RIP Bread and Butter). Liked everything 'cept for the waffle itself. 'Nuff said.",

Side note and its kind of unrelated: Why can we have a place like this in Tucson? Last time we had the lemon puppy seeds waffle at Mother hubbard's it was disaster...They effing poured the lemon syrup and sprinkled the puppy seeds over the plain waffle. And we waited for 45 min for that lousy waffle. Still pissed me off today!!!    Solid 4 stars.",

    "text": "Wait time was way more than expected, 38 minutes for a waffle is insane. When my partner and I finally got our waffles, they were cold and hard.    My partner requested no whip cream due to her being lactose intolerant. Watching you guys scrape the whip cream off is lazy and unprofessional. There's still traces of whip cream on there...  Customer service wasn't very friendly. We found Tiabi through Yelp based on their reviews and the overall experience was NOT up to par. It was very disappointing.   Environment was overwhelming crowded. The layout is a bit compact and not ideal for a large group of people. We had to sit at a dirty table until 2 mins before we received our food. It was disgusting.   Our drinks (teas) were also not given to us until 2 mins before our food arrived. Water wasn't even offered.   Don't get me wrong, we weren't expecting Ritz Carlton service BUT the basics of dining at a cafe. We might try it again when it's less busy, but I would give our overall experience 1 out of 5 stars.",

I got the hashtag breakfast sandwich with waffles,  turkey sausage, egg and cheese.  The waffles are made fresh and they're so good.  Also I tried the waffle Macchiato and although they took a long time to make the waffle for my Macchiato they gave me an extra waffle and it was muy delicioso.  I will be back even tho I live all the way in summerlin!  I will be recommending this place!",

Most places ask you what you want and want to get on with their day, but it's nice to walk into a restaurant for the first time and get acknowledged like they are happy you chose them as a place to eat today. It was a very cute/creative place. I love how there are cards at all the tables. I will have to bring my boyfriend just for that! Lol. I ordered the guru burger. (Vegan) and it was  interesting. I tasted the waffle and burger and it was weird at first but not gross. I definitely will go back. There is a few smoothies I would like to try.",

OMG, I normally don't order cinnamon sugar items but this was so good. This makes me wanna leave Maryland and hike it to Nevada. The \"chefs\" were friendly and accommodating. My only gripe is that it took a long time to get our food. Other than that, I would go back in a heartbeat.",

Even worse was watching the cook literally man handle every waffle that came out. Hopefully his gloves aren't latex because he would send anyone with a latex allergy to the hospital with his pulling waffles hot from the iron off with his fingers and then flipping the waffle between both hands then shoving them back on to the iron if he decided it wasn't dark enough. Despite the constant fiddling my waffle still managed to come to me cold.  It couldn't even melt the butter on it.  Flavor wise its not worth anything. My mocha was so over chocolated that the only flavour from the coffee was a bitter under note.  As for the waffle it was so nothing I might as well have had an eggo or poured bisquick shake and pour into my waffle iron   Oh, and they no longer offer Belgian waffles.    Just skip it.

    "text": "I heard from some people in the neighborhood that a new waffle place opened up right down the street on Flamingo & Maryland Pky, so I had to try!  It's a small order at the counter type of place, but everything is reasonably priced (use a Yelp! check-in to get 15% off, or UNLV students get a discount as well!)  The special here is waffles done in all sorts of ways (with toppings, or as a sandwich in some cases).    I went with a waffle with almonds, bananas and Nutella on it for about $6.  The taste of it was OK, presented and cooked well, but nothing too special about the batter.  The disadvantage was it took what seemed like forever to get it (maybe just because I was hungry?).  I also got a hot chocolate which was just so-so.  For the price it's a wonderful place, and it's close to Target so I could see coming here for brunch and doing some shopping, I know I'll be back, but the location and low pricing is the main driver.",

I got the waffle breakfast sandwich (mine had avocado, egg, vegan cheese, and sriracha) and it was one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. The lavender twilight latte is also amazing. Even my carnivore buddies liked this place (they have bacon waffles too).

Cant go wrong with a side of bacon. We had the Just peachy green tea. That was pretty good too. Nice and refreshing. My sister got the West Coast. The tiabi sauce is to die for. I would come back for that sauce. If you want savory, get the west coast. Overall great place to have breakfast. I would come back. I would have given 5 stars.

I'm not a waffle person (I'm personally a pancake or crepe person) and I absolutely LOVED my meal here. I passed by this place probably a million times since it's near UNLV but decided to come here since I got a free coupon from my school for their Tiff's waffle macchiato. I ordered their West Coast waffle which had chicken , their signature Tiabi sauce , melted cheese , avocado , tomato and I subbed their bacon for egg instead. It was pretty delicious and savory for breakfast/brunch and it wasn't too pricey ! And I was impressed w/ their waffle macchiato - I loved the cute little churro flavored waffle. Service was very friendly however they make everything by order so don't plan on rushing here to eat if you have class , etc. Also it's not a good place to study , tables are a bit dirty - it's more of a place to just to sit down & eat. They have Groupon and Yelp-in deals available too so more of a reason to come and try this place out :) and vegan options available. Will be back again to try the Savory Thai basil waffle and other menu items !",

It's worth a try if you're really into waffles, but for me the food menu items are just whatever. So far I've had the cinnamon waffle, elvis, and vegetarian wafflewich. I'll keep trying more items and update if anything deserves recognition. The location is a bit shabby so I make sure to bring my stuff with me. I wouldn't think of this place as comfortable- so it's not a place that you would want to study at. Eat, chat a bit with friends, and go.  As for customer service, don't expect too much.

Friendly customer service. We ordered a \"bananatella waffle\", which was basically a decent sized waffle with bananas, whipped cream, and a drizzle of nutella. Satisfying, however, seemed to have skimped on the nutella a bit. For my coffee, i ordered a small size drink (two shots of espresso blended with almond milk and ice) It was made perfectly to order.  Two stars missing are for the price, my small coffee beverage cost over $5 and i was just a little disappointed by the meager amount of nutella on my \"bananatella\" waffle.  Overall, would probably not return due to the price of the coffee, even though i did enjoy it. :/",

Looking at yelp reviews, I expected it to be more or less a Belgian waffle with cinnamon and sugar (which still sounds delicious). However, this waffle was much thinner than a Belgian. This kept it nice and crunchy, even with a huge scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.  Super delicious! And the staff was very friendly. I'll have to again next time I'm in Vegas.",

The prices for everything on the menu blew my mind because it's worth it as they cook from scratch! At least it tastes like they do. It's not the typical humongous servings. It's ideal servings.

We tried their cold brew coffee (really good), their strawberry waffle (fresh strawberries on an excellent crispy but fluffy waffle), and the Waffledilla (I added avocado and would recommend to everyone to do the same). We loved everything, the only thing I will do differently next time is to add more cheese to the Waffledilla. It was delicious, don't get me wrong, I just hoped for it to be a little bit cheesier after seeing pictures of it online. Will definitely give it another shot though and will also get the churro waffle next time to try that out. But this place is definitely worth visiting.   PS: the interior design is great, from the different seating options to star wars pictures and the picture line of totoro's adventures in the back.",

I tried a variety of foods the west coast wafflewich, the combination of avocado, chicken, bacon, etc was very flavorful highly recommended. I also tried the waffledilla and of course added avocado I think more cheese would have made it banging but it was good overall. Lastly, I had the famous Viva Las Elvis which was scrumptious. After all these foods all do contain a waffle so I topped all of it off with syrup and gave it that final taste! We had a party of 8 and the food was still out in a timely manner. The service was great to us. The inside is very cozy and unique. Waffles are messy but they manage to keep the area clean and organized.",

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?  You've got a comfortable atmosphere and solid service here at Tiabi. As embarrassed as I was to do it, I pulled out my phone and asked the server if he could mimic a honey ice cream sandwich that I'd seen on instagram, and within a few minutes I had a great replica right in front of me. Star.   Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  Because what I ordered wasn't on the menu I don't think myself or the server were really quite sure what to charge me for it, but it turned out to be a reasonable $8.25 for what was a sizable desert. Star.   Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  It's all. about. the waffle, and Tiabi absolutely nails it when it comes to the waffle. Their churro waffle was both one of the better waffles I've had in a while AND one of the better churros I've had - quite the feat. From there the ice cream and honey were standard, but were what I'd asked for. Single Star.   Star 5: Would you be excited to go back?  Great spot. I'd be excited to go back. Star.",

The waffle sandwiches actually are better for lunch or dinner. It has a pretty large menu for being a small place. Most items here are vegan.   I like the smoothies better than the coffee. It's about $6 for a smoothie. The banana peanut butter is my favorite. It's made with non dairy milk. This is a pretty good size. It has lots of waffles of course. They serve them as just waffles or they use them to  make sandwiches. I like the avocado waffle sandwich. It's about $6. They can make it vegan. Just substitute the vegan cheese. The check in  allows you to save 10% on an order.   It's one of the best places in Vegas for breakfast. It's actually good any time of day. The waffles are all vegan but they are made with gluten if you need to know that.",

    "text": "Very delicious place to take a few friends on their way to the airport.   I ordered the Groupon a few days ahead for us to use, which was a great deal. We all did either a waffle or waffle sandwich with a small or medium coffee to go along with it and with the Groupon ended up spending only about a dollar extra at the register. The Groupon deal we used was 3 $8 vouchers for ~$14, so each voucher cost about $4.60 or so. If you see the deal on Groupon, I highly recommend it, I'm going to be looking for it again, so I can go back on my own too!   I ordered the banana Nutella waffle, which was a made-in-house waffle with banana slices, Nutella drizzle, almond slices, and whipped cream on top. Definitely something I'd get again. It was perfectly topped, any more toppings would've probably been too much. I also got the snickers iced coffee which had hazelnut and chocolate syrups and was absolutely delicious.   The waffle breakfast sandwiches my friends enjoyed looked super delicious as well, and I'd like to come back to try one of those or one of their more lunchtime type waffle sandwiches.   Overall, I'd recommend this spot. It's not far from the strip and is only about a block away from UNLV. They make great waffles and coffee and the staff are friendly and helpful. All of our items came out in about 10 minutes for our 4 separate orders. I'll definitely be back and can't wait to bring more friends too.",

Could be better, staff seemed more interested in talking to one another but our food came out in an appropriate time.  EXPERIENCE: small indoors seating with multiple tables. Nothing terribly exciting about the wall decorations.  VALUE: most waffles were under $7, add chips for $1. Coffees around $2. Definitely appropriately priced.  SUMMARY: Great breakfast place with interesting waffles at an awesome value. Perfect change of pace for tourists who are sick of hotel food!",

Anyway, came across this shop while looking for some good coffee in LV. This one had a lot of amazing reviews so I knew it was a must try. I was greeted very nicely by the guy in the back. He said he would be with me shortly so I went and looked at the menu. They had a few signature drinks that I was so intrigued to try every single one! Instead I had the first one which had cinnamon and vanilla with a waffle. My husband needed the extra kick so he got the java jolt. I wanted the cinnamon one with soy and the guy forgot that he didn't put soy. He was nice enough to give me the one he made for free and made me A new one with soy. I love excellent customer service! The excellent customer service came with good tasting coffee as well. The waffle was also good. I wish I could try all the other drinks but I guess I'll have a list when I come to visit next time.... can't wait!",

    "text": "Sorry, but I'm not impressed by the food at this place.  I'm wondering if the other Yelpers only gave high stars for the aesthetic b/c I can admit, it's a cute restaurant but for me, it's mostly about the food.  I ordered the Viva Las Elvis waffle (banana, peanut butter, bacon, and honey.)  The ingredients paired well together; however, the actual waffle itself was hard as a hockey puck.  I could tell it was cooked a little bit over.  To make matters worse, there was no syrup offered and I was told by the postmates driver if I wanted syrup it would be an additional charge.  Uhh..no thanks.  $7.50 for the waffle, no syrup and no side items.    The snickers iced coffee was also on my radar, but again I was disappointed.  For it to be snickers, there sure is no sweetener.  They could've simply labeled it iced coffee and I would've known to add my own flavour.  Since chocolate, hazelnut, caramel, and creamer are listed on the list of contents, I wasn't expecting to need additional sugar.  Boy was I wrong.  It cost $2.65 which I can get behind.  All in all, it was an average experience.  I most likely won't be back.",

When I started to look at the menu and read everything that was available I was like Whhhhhaaatttttt is this place. A Coffee and Waffle  bar Genius!   This place had speciality waffles or build your own. I wasn't hungry at the time so I ordered a coconut cooler for my daughter and a Coconut truffle iced Coffee. All of it was bomb. The coconut Cooler had fresh mint and some juices that came together very well I might say. Oh! and my coffee was Fabulous just Wonderful. I drank it so fast I should of savored it. Well since I am a frequent visitor of the sin city.;) I will be back to try a waffle and more coffee.   You will no be disappointed when you get here. Kid friendly and the waffles looked so good. I can't wait to come back. I need those waffles in my life!  Great execution on this concept! Kudos to you!",

The waffle was crisp and crunchy which was good. Breakfast wafflewich was delicious but needs a little maple syrup, which we didn't get to have anymore bec we took the food to-go. Prices are reasonable.   I'll think about whether giving this place another try. Otherwise, they should add more staff.",

The staff is always friendly and before they expanded, it was the owners Tiffany and Mae working everyday and they would try to know everyone personally. The drinks and food are great but it's even better knowing you're supporting genuine people.   If you're into coffee, they have some quality beans and drinks for you. If not there are smoothies and teas. Lots of veggie options for food, which is nice but they pretty much cater to any preference. They are from Guam, and I've found that islanders have a pallet that leans more towards sweet flavors, so expect that when ordering food lol. It's not a bad thing, you can definitely taste that a lot of their inspiration comes from their home. Food is made fresh and to order.   Anyway, check this spot out and tip your baristas.",

    "text": "I was craving a good breakfast place when I found this little beauty. Oh man, did this place not disappoint. I got the maple bacon waffle. First off, I like bacon, but most of the time I feel like people overdo it. This, however, was the perfect amount of crisp, fresh bacon mixed into the BATTER and then cooked into an amazingly soft but crisp waffle. Offset the saltiness of the bacon with a sticky sweet maple syrup and you have a perfectly balanced waffle. I also got the honey cream latte. I do feel like the honey needed to be intensified a little more to cut through the bold taste of the espresso, but overall it was a nice fresh taste on a normal latte. Will definitely track this place down again the next time I'm in Vegas.",

When I found out about this place on my last trip, I was excited but I had no idea what was waiting for me. These aren't just waffles. They are delicious, fluffy, soft waffles with just the right amount of crisp and crunch on the outside. I got the Thai chicken waffle sandwich without cheese. It was the best food I've had on my vacation by far. You can get a more classic waffle dessert with different batter options and customized toppings if you want more of a dessert. Also, yes, they have vegan ice cream.   The drinks are nice too. I've tended to stick to tea blends to hydrate on hot days, but they have a few interesting looking blended drinks and, of course, fun coffee options.  The waffles take a little bit of time to make, so go in with a little patience, but know that it is so worth it.  I fully recommend this place to anyone with a mouth who enjoys food.",

    "text": "The Good A very pleasant and nice staff with reasonably priced items.    The Bad The food and the wait. My wife ordered the banana Nutella waffle which came out first and the waffle was overcooked and very dry. The Nutella was flavorless and limited as it was drizzled on. My only other experience to compare this type of waffle with was at Disneyworld and there waffle was moist, soft and warm with the Nutella adding a great accent.  I ordered the hashtag waffle and a banana Nutella for me. The hashtag was again an overcooked, dry and burnt in some areas waffle with turkey sausage that tasted like they came out of the frozen foods section at Von's supermarket.  Completely flavorless. The egg that came with it I cannot not even explain what it looked like.  My banana Nutella waffle did not even look like my wife's as by the time I got it I was told they were having issues with there waffle maker. It reminded me of one my 12 year old made me for Father's Day.   The Ugly Due to technical problems everything took twice as long as long as it should.  I even saw A gentleman get up who had been waiting there before us asking why was it taking so long for his food.  For my inconvenience of waiting so long they offered me a cookie. At that moment they should've offered to discount my food at least.   One of the things I hate having to do on a yelp review is do a negative review. Hopefully, for others they will not receive this type of food or delay.  My goal is always to stay away from the chain restaurants and find those little hidden gems in the city.  Unfortunately, I didn't find the gem.",

While I really like waffles, I can also make them at home, so they are usually just okay, in my opinion.  I ordered the waffledilla sandwich without tiabi sauce. It was spectacular. The flavor of the waffle is off the charts. It had just the right about the sweetness, and the texture was a perfect balance of soft and crispy. The chicken was also moist, and I really enjoyed the whole thing. The chips are also pretty good too, which was unexpected as, again, they are just chips.   Finally, for dessert I had the cinnamon sugar covered waffle with ice cream. It was really good. I surprisingly enjoyed my sandwich more, though, because the sandwich was more so something that I would not be able to replicate at home.   Tiabi also frequently has living social or Groupon deals, so this place ends up being super, super cheap.   I will definitely be back for more.",

We both ordered the Frankenstein thinking it was going to be a hot coffee.  Our cold frothy drinks were presented to us at the counter.  We didn't realize that a blend means it is blended with ice. We thought it was a blend of roasts.  We spoke to the nice gal behind the counter and she explained the differences to us.  My friend then ordered the Java Jolt (which is out of this world good).  The cashier brought out the J.J. when it was ready and wanted to make sure we were satisfied with our drinks.  We tried to pay for the third drink but she refused and said it was on them and apologized for the confusion.  We also asked for a low carb option, she said they could do a sandwich without the waffle, so we opted for that.  It came out perfect and the eggs even had the waffle iron griddle marks.  They have earned a spot on my list of local favorites to visit for Vegas.  Thanks again and keep up the great work.",

    "text": "So it's located in the plaza with Target on the Maryland Parkway side. It'd be easy to miss it if you don't know where to look!   It's a small cozy cafe with seating for around 30-40 people? It's super close to UNLV which makes it a prime place to go to for a coffee break and possibly to study. They do have free WiFi! And the owners are pretty cool and really nice.  I ended up getting waffles and tea, more specifically I got the vegan version of Viva Las Elvis with vegan ice cream. It's a waffle with peanut butter, honey (agave if vegan version), and coconut bacon with a scoop of ice cream on top. It was pretty good, nothing too spectacular. The peanut butter melted into the waffle which was pretty awesome, because I mean melted peanut butter on anything is delicious! And the ice cream was well vegan vanilla ice cream and wasn't too special to me.   I'll probably not get tea again, only because it was $2 for a bag and one cup of hot water. I'm not sure if they'll give you more hot water, but one bag and one cup of water doesn't seem like it's worth it.   My biggest gripe was that it was DIRTY. I mean the tables, I went through two tables and they were both dirty. There was dried syrup on them and stains from the last customers. I looked down to see if there were any other tables, but most of them seemed like they were dirty to me. I tried cleaning some of it off, but most of it didn't come off with a napkin and some water. That to me is disgusting especially since it seems most people leave their dishes and the owners clean it off. That's just how it looked to me, when other customers ate and then left. When I got there the whole cafe was empty but as I sat there there were people that came and go. So they didn't really have an excuse to be dirty.   I do however want to try some other menu items the next time I go. I just hope it's cleaner this time. I like the owners, they're pretty nice to talk to. I like the atmosphere. I like the location. I like some of their food so far. But I don't like dirty tables where I'm going to eat especially at cafe/restaurants/etc.",

I love small businesses like these, especially in a place like Las Vegas, they are diamonds in the rough!  Trust me, we went to some pretty bad spots using Livingsocial/Groupon deals before here.  John, our cashier was very polite and friendly, and the food was pretty unique. Definitely recommend hitting up this little gem next time you're in Vegas and don't want that tourist Vegas service. :)",

Also, today we came in and were told we couldn't order food because of a catering order they have. I do love the honey cream latte and waffle sandwiches, and the owner is really nice.",

It's one of those home town places where you want to bring your friends. You can hangout and have brunch or stop by for a late snack and dessert. They have all different types of waffles that will satisfy your craving. I personally love the waffledilla. It's the cheapest waffle sandwhich and will melt in your mouth! It's chicken, cheese, special sauce (that is sooooo yummy) in between a waffle folded in half and is super scrumptious. You can add a fruit bowl (variety so I'd ask what kind they have that day in case you are allergic or don't like a certain type of food) or homemade chips just for $1! Sweet deal! And it's pretty much a meal. They have a water pitcher towards the back. But they also have teas and smoothies. I haven't tried the smoothies but I want to! I like the \"Just Peachy\" tea. It's not too sweet but has a good taste. I always suggest this place because it's very central, it's cheap, they have dessert waffles too (try the red velvet) and they're friendly. It's located inside the Target plaza so there's a lot of traffic goin on around the place. But definitely a place to try if you haven't!",

They wrap bacon, cheese, chic...  I decided I needed a pick-me-up and Tiabi popped up on my coffee radar (the yelp app) and I headed that way. As I parked my car and walked towards the door, I became skeptical about this place considering this neighbor can be non-friendly at times. I walked in and did the classic Hanna-Barbera/ Scooby Doo surprised look. This place was clean, inviting, and I was greeted with a giant smile and brief intro on the place. Great way to start my waffle fueled experience.    I ordered the, \"West Coast Waffle Wafflewich\" and the \"Stiles Java Jolt\". The \"West Coast\", I was told is the fan favorite and if you read what I wrote above, that's easy to believe. This sammie is big, about half the size of an average dinner plate. The tasty ingredients are added to the savory waffle, then folded over to immediately give you this pocket-like snack item. As I ate, I was afraid of two things; all of the food falling out of the opposite biting side, and a weird sweet waffle paired with cheese. My fears waffled away as the crunch of the bacon filled my ears, the tender & juicy chicken, cheese, and veggies came together in the warm waffle. This sandwich was fantastic, and turned out to be one of those food items you realize you haven't put down since the first bite. This Wafflicious sammie was paired with seasoned homemade waffle chips. Fantastic mutated breakfast/ lunch combo.  The Stiles Java Jolt was delicious. Espresso, coffee, and just a tad of vanilla flavoring. I went half on the flavoring, because I don't have a huge sweet tooth, but Normally it comes with four pumps of vanilla. I could have drank two more of these delicious caffeinated bullets, but then I might turn into Spider-Man and climb the walls.",

So far I have not tried the sweet waffles, but on the savory waffle front I'm in love with the Waffidilla add the avocado and the West Coast. Both full of cheese and meaty goodness inside a perfectly cooked waffle.   The coffee is amazing! On your first visit you must have the Tiffs Waffle Macchiato. It has a churro waffle in a very strong, slightly cinnamon flavored coffee. My favorite is the Espresso Frankenstein. It's perfect if you enjoy the taste of coffee. Plus, as sweetener they use is agave. Yay!  The service is spot on and everyone is talkative, energized and helpful. If you go in often you will get to know them and how sweet they really are. The atmosphere a is pure coffee shop, random tables that don't match and chairs that are odd. I do love the long wood bench that runs the length of the wall. Plus, the cool art on the walls are really unique and cool.   My love of coffee shops runs deep and Tiabi Coffee has definitely become close to my heart!",

You get two waffles which is perfect if you're hungry or to share if you're just looking to snack. The coffee was fresh/strong/sweet/milky which made for a great combo.

The staff is incredibly friendly and genuine. You can tell they at happy to serve you. They smile when they work and seems like they all love what they do, like it's more than just a job to them. They also take the time to get to know their customers. While we were there, they greeted multiple customers by name and had casual conversations with them.  There are a lot of options on the menu, for both drinks and food. We got the Viva Las Elvis (amazing), Tiff's Waffle Macchiato (amazing), Hashtag Breakfast Sandwich (good, but sausage seemed like it was a frozen patty), and Snickers Latte (good, not too chocolatey).   Overall, this place is a gem! We'll definitely be coming back :)",

The place was slammed and the four employees behind the counter were busy making fresh smoothies, espresso, waffles, and the like.  My iced honey latte was perfection. Fresh espresso, cream, and a touch of honey. It wasn't overly sweet and it still tasted like coffee. Really enjoyed it. It was just too small. I had to order another.  I got the Hashtag Breakfast Sandwich. Really nothing too special about it. Fresh made waffle, egg, cheese, and sausage. Wasn't awful, wasn't knock my socks off. It was offered with either a side of fruit or house made chips for $1, I opted with the fruit (because this was a total fat kid breakfast).  As I stated previously, the place was slammed. My friend and I snagged a table after a group of four left. We stacked up the dishes and ate at the \"dirty\" table because we are savages and needed the immune system boost.  We sat at that dirty table and the place had died down, not once did the 4 people behind the counter begin to clean the place up or even clear our dishes.   Decent spot, coffee was the bombDOTcom, food was meh. Definitely would go back for the coffee, but I'd skip the food.",

    "text": "We chose to eat here at tiabi before our first day at Edc, with my husband and I from Sacramento and a bunch of our friends from Los Angeles, we were really excited to try out this really cute waffle shop. Seeing the pictures and menu on Yelp, I already super intrigued by the banana and Nutella waffle.  With a big group entering the shop, we were sort of aware that maybe we would have to split up our group to sit down and eat.  It was self serve, so we each ordered our meal, standing around at first trying to find a spot to sit. Eventually we found a table big enough for us if we all squished together.  The food sort of took a little while to get to our table, but we did get our drinks first.  I ordered the Serena tea (or something like that I don't remember), but it was super refreshing. Especially against that Las Vegas heat. Some of our friends had also ordered several other drinks, and they loved theirs as well.  When our food finally came, we got the sandwiches first. Most of my friends had ordered the west coast sandwich, and they were super pleased with it. Another one of my friend ordered the Thai chicken and he was really glad with that one as well. Overall I'd say that tiabi was pretty satisfying for my group of friends. Although small, it does give off a comfortable vibe. Very easy going and relaxed, the customer service was also pretty great.",

    "text": "If you love waffles, you won't be disappointed. I was visiting Vegas for a week and just stumbled on Tiabi. It was so good, I returned twice. The breakfast sandwich is a standout. My one complaint is the time it takes to prepare your food - about 15-20 minutes - even though the restaurant had no more than four patrons on each of my visits. One person prepares the food and another your drink, and either one is also taking orders, all of which makes for slow service. So if you're in a hurry or just want to grab something for the road, it's probably not the best place to go. If you're not, it's worth the wait. I'll definitely return whenever I'm in Vegas.",

My husband I went shortly after they opened and we were the only guests dining in - there was a couple take-outs while we waited and dined (their website permits for online orders).  We were assisted by Mae (one of the owners) who was incredibly friendly and welcoming about our first visit.  My husband had the red velvet waffles, I had the #breakfast sandwich. I had a Carmel apple cider (by far much better than Starbucks) and my husband had a mocha latte (great also).   While we did wait about 15-20 minutes for our food (not bad by any regular standards) - Mae was apologetic for our time waiting and treated us to a sample of their Churronimo (delicious!).  Will definitely revisit in the future!",

I am not a big sweets person so I put very little sweet and low in my tea if any.  This flavor did not need any sweetener.   Then I ordered their B.A.T. on waffle instead of bread. It was just ok.  The waffle seemed overdone to me and the sandwich was lacking taste.  Nice fruit side bowl, but strawberries were on their last leg.   I think most of the positive reviews were for the waffle desserts. So if I ever come back again, then I will stick to the sweet side of the menu, even though sweets are not my favorite.",

    "text": "I'm all for helping out small, locally-owned shops, but to get me to visit a second time the food has to be good. With Tiabi, I'm on the fence. On one hand the B.A.T. wafflewich ($4.95) with its bacon, arugula, and tomato was delicious. I don't know what the Tiabi sauce in the wafflewich consisted of, but in combination with the other ingredients it made it unbelievably tasty. On the other hand, the Break-The-Fast wafflewich ($4.95) was a complete disaster. The whole thing looked sad. The sausage was barely warm, the cheese looked like it was straight out the fridge having had no contact with any heat to melt it, and the scrambled eggs looked like prepackaged/pre-cooked eggs found at McDonald's.  Somewhere in between in quality were the two waffle dishes I tried. Ordered as a Belgian waffle, the maple bacon waffle ($5.99) was thick and soft, as expected, with large chunks of bacon in the batter. The savory and saltiness of it in combination with the sweetness of the batter and syrup made it a solid choice all around. The red velvet waffle ($5.50), ordered as a classic thin waffle, lacked any crispness around the exterior. The flavor was well balanced with a moderate amount of chocolate chips and whipped cream giving it enough sweetness without making it too overindulgent.  With classic, Belgian, and vegan waffles, specialty coffee drinks and frozen drinks, there's plenty of promise here. Unfortunately, some of the execution on my visit was lackluster. And, don't expect fast service. Even with three employees hustling in the back we waited a while for our orders despite being the first ones through the door in the morning.",

My waffle was obviously homemade from scratch and even featured house roasted pecans and caramel drizzle. Both my father's coffee and my iced mocha were absolutely fantastic as well. We were very impressed by the friendly ambience and tasteful signage throughout the establishment. Would recommend coffee and waffles here for any one any time!",

The menu is on the wall and very easy to read. I got a coffee and it came with a churro waffle! See the picture. It was sooo delicious! My banana waffle had bananas, nuts, and nutella drizzled on it. It was so amazingly good. I would have gone again if we were staying longer. Definitely will go again next time I'm in town!",

Owner (?) was super patient, kind, and helpful, and even went back and printed a receipt when I forgot to ask for one initially. This place deserves to be way bigger and pricier than it is.",

    "text": "I hate leaving negative reviews, but hopefully this well encourage management to make some improvements.  First of all they're basically a self-service breakfast restaurant. I wish I would have known that before coming, because the last thing I want to do when I go out to breakfast in the morning is carry a bunch of stuff to my table. For instance, my order required 3 plates, how was I supposed to carry that, they didn't provide a tray.  The floors were dirty, my table was dirty and the tables all around me were also dirty. It's hard to enjoy a meal when there's so much uncleanliness around. Please clean your floors more often and take the time to clean tables once customers leave. Small details like this say quality. My waffle was also crunchy and cold... Sorry, again I don't like leaving negative reviews. The restaurant was super cute I think the self serve concept might be good enough for some people but when you're half sleep and just want some food it's not ideal. They did complete my order very quickly.",

Waffle Dilla (chicken, tiabi sauce and melted cheese) - chicken was moist and chopped up and the sauce/cheese/meet proportions were just right.   Viva Las Elvis (bananas, peanut butter, chopped bacon and honey on a waffle) - peanut butter was warm and creamy, bacon was thin and crispy bits. Overall, it was pretty good.   The prices match the serving size. It's a tad on the small side, but I didn't mind because it allowed us to try more items and not be overstuffed or have leftovers.  I didn't care for the pistachio latte. The pistachio taste was really difficult to find.   We went at an odd day/time, so service was fine. After we got our food, the line was super long. Since they have limited staff and equipment, I can definitely see them getting backed up.",

Visited on Sunday 6-26-16 at 10AM.   $28.34 got us a breakfast waffle sandwich, two drinks, a side of fruit, a cookie, and a variety waffle. This restaurant is located two doors down from Sakana on Flamingo & Maryland behind Target.    I had the viva las elvis waffle for $6.99 which is a waffle topped with honey, peanut butter, bananas, and chopped bacon.  I was literally in heaven.  It's one of the best things I've ever eaten.  My only complaint would be they serve real maple syrup which I hate...I'd rather have the fake Aunt Jamima stuff clogging up my arteries and killing me slowly.  #DIABEETUS  I also had the Tiff's Waffle Macchiato for $3.95.  I had the iced version and it was wonderful.  I loved the whipped cream topping and the waffle on top was still warm and covered in cinnamon and sugar.    Service was fast and friendly.  I highly recommend this place.",

I came in with a suitcase as to make a quick last minute stop for breakfast and get a caffeine fix. The girl at the front was so friendly and welcoming!   What I had:   Breakfast Sandwich + well done bacon + extra cheese:  This was the perfect combination of sweet, fluffy, and savory (and crunchy from the bacon). One thing I was worried about was the waffle being too sweet, but instead it had subtle hints of maple flavoring. Perfect.  Tiff's Waffle Macchiato: A cinnamon vanilla macchiato topped with a churro waffle. A perfect creamy consistency, and the churro waffle adds the perfect touch of crunchiness- if you dip it into the drink. What dreams are made of.

I love waffles, I love strawberries, I love tea, juices, sandwiches, quesadillas... so I was REALLY looking forward to this place. We came in and we ordered the strawberry kisses and the west coast. Get a taste of sweet and savory. We also got the snickers coffee and some juice that was seasonal.  I'll start by saying I liked the snickers thing. But then I have to move into the bad part.  They seem to use the same waffle mix for their sweet and savory waffles. What does this mean? It means my breakfast was too savory and my lunch was too sweet. And I was very bummed. I swear, I wanted to like it. I might even try it again some day, in hope of a good wafflewich. But it fell short. The strawberries on top helped amp up the breakfast, but the lunch could not be saved. So be it. We had a great time at SeaQuest afterwards, but I'll keep dreaming of the perfect waffle and hope Tiabi can make it in the future. Still rooting for you, but can't justify more than 2 stars for now.",

I had an enjoyable experience the waffle and the coffee were good. The place is clean and the staff is warm and friendly. My only issue was the location. I went early Sunday Morning around 830. There are some homeless men in the area but this part of Vegas has not gone through the revitalization that Freemont East has enjoyed yet, I do like the fact that Tiabi is located there, the area needs businesses like Tiabi to revitalize the area. I would like to support this local business, but I won't return. I was very uncomfortable with the homeless men in front of the shop. There was even a homeless man inside trying to make a purchase with change, he didn't have enough money and went back and forth with the cashier half the time I was there. I wanted to make sure I left the restaurant before Him so that I could get to my car. While He was talking to the cashier I quickly grabbed my purse and went to the door to leave, the homeless man was right behind me. Luckily He went the opposite way from where I was going. I was a little scared by this. I went to my car and locked my door. I noticed the homeless man that I saw inside was near the shop yelling and cursing at an invisible person. Also noticed that there was another homeless man in sitting in the parking lot singing very loudly to himself. Unfortunately I won't be back unless I go with a group. The neighborhood is too sketchy.",

This place makes a bomb espresso for your training espresso shot.   This is my favorite place to grab lunch or breakfast in Vegas.  I live within walking distance and go about 1-2 times a month.  The staff always remembers me and I don't even have to mention that I'm vegetarian since my first visit.  My favorite is the Viva Las Elvis, they make this awesome vegan bacon that is made from coconut flakes in place of all their regular bacon items.  Another favorite of mine is the Guru Burger.  They are happy to try new combinations too if you ask.  My roommate is a carnivore and we always go together.  He really enjoys their non-vegan options as well.  Edit/Disclaimer.  I work here now as of a month ago.  This review was prior to my employment.",

The items felt like it came from a box and wasn't that much of a difference from a fast food breakfast \"sandwich\".    I do not like the type of groupon they put out. You have to literally come back a couple of times to use all of them. The instructions are there but from now on I'm literally avoiding all groupons that expect you to come back each time to use. Actually I'm not even a fan of groupon but a friend convince me to try this place with her. Even she wasn't impressed due to the fact that she can make waffles at home that tasted better ( her words not mine).    Coffee drinks is a hit or miss. Some tasted ok and some tasted bitter.",

    "text": "Came here for the first time the other day and really enjoyed it. I got the Guru Burger and thought it was quite good- this is definitely a compliment from me because, honestly, I'm not usually a huge fan of waffle sandwichs! My previous waffle sandwich experiences have always left me feeling like I could have made the sandwich at home with two Eggo waffles (and it, honestly, would have probably been easier to eat than the folded, taco-ish style they all go for!). This waffle sandwich blew my Eggo creations to the wayside- their waffles are really flavorful and fluffy, better than I've had in ages. I also had one of their seasonal lattes- the Fa La La Latte, because I'm a sucker for anything mint!- and a bit of the lavender latte on accident... which, leads me to my only complaint about this place. I came with a friend who has a very similar sounding name to mine and when the barista called out her name, we both thought it was mine because I had ordered a few minutes before her... well, we were definitely wrong! I thought the latte didn't have much mint to it (but it was damn good, either way!) but didn't think anything of it until the barista called out my name followed by the name of my latte about 5 minutes later. That could have been avoided so easily just by writing the name on the cup. Having to remake a drink sucks way more than taking the 5 seconds to write a name on the cup! Either way, great coffee and great waffles- would recommend! :)",

My husband and I got the west coast and hash tag breakfast sandwich and strawberry sunrise smoothie. The west coast was good BUT the hash tag breakfast sandwich was hands down..the best waffle sandwich I ever had. The waffle was so airy, fluffy, and buttery and the sausage and egg was puuuurrrfect. The smoothie was the best I ever had.  The guy at the register was so chill and patient while we couldn't make up our mind! We also had a red velvet lollie and it was was such a treat. I give this place 2 thumbs up!",

It's on Maryland and flamingo in the target shopping center. We walk in, there's no where really to sit. It's a very cute shop but really small. Super clean. Everything on the menu sounded sooo good. I literally couldn't decide for like 15 minutes lol. The service was great. I got a waffle and coffee, and my total came out to like 14 bucks! I was so confused. I could've gotten Starbucks and a Belgium waffle from Egg Works for less than that. Definitely not worth that much money. I would go there more often if it wasn't so expensive and in the hood of Las Vegas.",

The waffle had a good balance of softness and crunchy. I also had a side of chips which I believe were barbecue flavor and it was way better than the Lay's ones. 10/10 would want to come here again to try their other items like the normal waffles or the dessert waffle taco.",

Try the coconut bacon and the banana peanut butter smoothie. And the Tiabi sauce is great. Yay, waffles...!!",

    "text": "SMOOTHIE IS THE BEST THING HERE......not coffee....or waffles  For a place that is specifically a coffee and waffle place... Both the coffee and waffles are not that great. The coffee is mainly milk and barely any coffee. We tried a skinny latte, iced coffee, tiffs coffee with a waffle on top. The coffee flavor is not strong at all but mainly milky ... Maybe next time we should just order black coffee.  The waffles on the other hand are kinda soggy. They are topped with so much whipped cream and sauces that is what probably took out the good crunch in the waffle.  The best thing at this place was their smoothies surprisingly. I would give their smoothies a 5! The Green Nut is absolutely the best smoothie ever! And it is healthy with almond and kale it is so refreshing!! I would highly recommend it to anyone. I would come here again but ONLY to get another smoothie not for anything else.   Also there is a good groupon for this place my friend and I tried it out we each bought $24 worth at this place. But interestingly enough the Groupons  come in three separate Groupons worth $8 each. I am ok with that because we can come multiple times, but when I came with my friend he had his groupon and I had mine and they had the audacity to question us and tell us that we cannot use it when coming within \"one visit\" well he bought his separate and I bought mine. It is a different transaction who cares it is also separate visit because it is his visit, then my visit.  Also,what if I wanted to use my second groupon would it be considered a \"different visit\" if I walked out the door then came back in? They are sticklers about this rule so if you bought a groupon then watch out they are going to grill you about it!",

    "text": "Used to love this place. The food tastes delicious and they have wifi, so I can study here. I introduced many of my family and friends to this place.  That being said, the service is below average. Not only is the wait time long (they only had 2 or 3 waffle makers, understandable bc they're a small mom and pop shop which I loved), but the owner/worker takes customer requests and suggestions personally. I asked for strawberries and Nutella on my waffle, as I always ordered it. When I received it, there were no strawberries. I hate to complain about food bc they have the power to spit in it when you're not looking, but I thought they'd be ok with me asking since I'd been there several times previously. When I asked, they took a few minutes and handed over a small bowl of sliced strawberries. I thought they were going to add it to my plate, so I brought it up to the counter. When she saw I did this, she grudgingly said,\"Oh, you wanted ME to put those on there?\" I replied that I could do it, a little embarrassed.   The reason this was a red flag for me is because one of my earlier stops there, I heard the staff talking about a recent Yelp review. The review spoke of the bad service the customer received. The girl in question defended herself and stated she did nothing wrong. I didn't think anything of this the first time. A subsequent time I was there, a foreign couple (Italian accent?) was asking why their 2 waffles were not similar and if they could remake one because they enjoyed the crispier one. The same owner/worker who didn't take criticism well kept insisting that it was made the same and they just had to let it sit longer to get the crispy consistency.   At that point, I hadn't been crossed by one of her moods yet, so I continued visiting to get my delicious coffee, waffles and to study. Then, that day hit as it inevitably would. I haven't returned since and don't intend to. Customer service is key, any business owner should know this.   Since I know you (the owners) read the Yelp reviews, I'd like to offer up some constructive criticism: you should cater to your customers. If you take these comments personally and become defensive, your customers will only continue to be dissatisfied with your service.",

(next time, I'll get all the sweetener--who am I kidding).   Later, I additionally had an Almond Milk Green Tea Latte and it's possibly my favorite Green Tea Latte I've ever had.

If you're confused on any part of the menu, they will take the time to explain anything to you. No pushy upselling either which is definitely a plus. Be prepared to wait based on the amount of people ahead of you since everything is made to order. However, definitely worth the wait!",

They have waffles for every kind of meal from breakfast to dinner.  I had the bacon waffle and my husband had the Western waffle (chicken bacon avocado etc) and their coffee is excellent and he had lemon ginger tea.  Kids would love that place.  The only thing that keeps us from giving it the 5th star is that it is too small and the tables and chairs are not that comfortable and really no decor...so you are there primarily for their menu and they don't let you down there.    PS...if you order something that requires butter, have them butter it.  Those little butter things are a bugger to open and they said they don't mind pre buttering for you.",

My waffle breakfast sandwich was also very tasty and my grandparents loved their meals as well. My grandma had a red velvet waffle and my grandpa had a blueberry waffle. Cute little place and I would return next time I'm in town for your not so traditional breakfast experience.",

Today I had a random craving to get the one drink I sideways get from them, kale champ smoothie.   Out of all the kale drinks I have tasted and tried theirs was by far the best and I literally had it every other day. Today though, years later, my bf went to pick one up for me.   When I first saw it my initial reaction was that it looked more green than usual. And then when I tried it, it was definitely NOT the kale champ I knew and loved. It was waaaay too bitter and I felt they left out an ingredient, maybe banana. Had I gone there and ordered it myself and tried it before leaving, I would have asked them to recheck it or add something to it to make it drinkable. I feel it's a waste of money just throwing it out so I'm forcing myself to gulp large amounts of it. I may have to adjust it myself too but it's just disappointing...",

Crispy on the outside and fluffy in the inside and best of all, their waffles are thin! Menu is to your left as you enter, went with the breakfast waffle. Scrambled eggs were cheesy and slightly undercooked, which I also really love (don't judge please)... they were yummy, but the bacon was super thin and I seemed old. 4 stars because the lady who took our order never took off her glove and after she touched my cash she went to the coffee machine and touched some things. Unsure if she quickly changed it when I turned around but I'm leaning towards no because when I watched her in the kitchen prior to waiting for her to take our order, she touched some waffles to check if they were ready then she came to the register and took our order. :/",

Well, it's a great idea for a business using waffles on every single plate but unfortunately their waffles are not unique.  We ordered: - Kisses Waffle - Golden Waffle - Waffledilla  - South West Sandwich - Breakfast Sandwich  - Americano - Chai Latte - tuxedo frap - waffle caramel ice coffee  While the whole menu idea is creative, some of the waffles were burnt and crunchy. The kisses waffle, golden waffle and Waffledilla were so toasted that it would hurt to eat them.  All others were soft and done the right way. Flavor was ok but nothing to wow anybody. I just feel that they are missing something that makes their waffles in general stand out.  Their drinks were amazing. I would definitely come back for drinks. Tasty and several options available.  The Good: - Great cafe in a random strip mall - Nice Staff - Great Drinks - Only one of the very few places that have Stevia  The Bad: - Burnt Waffles - We got all coffees on to-go cups although we ate there.  - No High-Chairs available",

The grilled chicken I had was similar to the grilled chicken at Subway and the back is extremely thin. The Tiabi sauce I couldn't even taste. The sandwich should have better quality of ingredients and more sauce. Staff was very nice and patient, gave great recommendations.",

Well, fast forward to today and I decided to come in for a coffee and bite to eat. I was instantly met with a lovely charm that was warm and refreshing to my soul. Adrian greeted me with a smile and kind patience as my indecision kicked in. I ordered a white mocha with almond milk (huge win) and the flavors that came from my cup tickled my senses and angered me because I deprived myself for so long from this treat. Anyway.. I look forward to being back soon and seeing where else this Vegas gem can take my senses..  Thank You Adrian!",

    "text": "I really want this place to succeed (who wouldn't want two young entrepreneurs to be successful?)  but some improvements are needed. We were lured here by a Groupon offer. I hope this critique is viewed by the owners and taken into consideration with this in mind. I love the concept of a waffles and coffee shop. Our coffees and waffles were very tasty and we did enjoy the food (maple bacon and red velvet). However, a place that specializes in waffles really needs more than one regular waffle iron and I would also like to see the option of a Belgian waffle added. Heck there are even waffle irons that make waffles shaped like the state of Texas...that would be a fun addition. Invest in more waffle irons! When ordering coffee to drink in the restaurant it is much, much better served in a glass coffee cup/mug. The paper plates and very cheap plastic utensils did not provide the best presentation. At the very least try to budget for a better quality of eating utensils. Again- the coffee (an iced snickers coffee, a latte and a cupcake coffee) were all very good, so maybe glass mugs can be added to make them perfect. The atmosphere is okay but I would encourage the addition of some cozier seating and decor...I would have ordered another coffee and stayed longer. I liked the chalkboard wall. The place was a bit cluttered with trash, overflowing trash cans and our table was sticky with dried syrup from what seemed to be days old. There were no pastries in the pastry case which made me sad. The music was too loud at first but was adjusted and included a nice variety of genres. This place has big potential. I realize it takes a lot of money to open a business and hopefully the owners can make some adjustments and improvements to make Tiabi a place to return to. Good luck girls!",

Their choices for waffles and drinks are really unique. I'm not a fan of waffles, but the B.A.T. Waffle Sandwich was so delicious. If you like iced teas, Just Peachy is perfection. Best of all, its located near UNLV. I highly recommend this restaurant!!!!",

Apparently named as an acronym of the underlying motto \"to inspire and be inspired\" with free WiFi and an innovative drink list including a rich caramel and cocoa infused iced coffee for myself plus a heavily praised honey cream iced latte for my friend it was after only a few moments of indecision that our order was placed and chatting while we waited the tasting soon began with a duo of $2.50 \"lollies,\" the single strips of spongy dough pressed between hot metal proving paltry in portion and largely flavorless save for the sweet finishing drizzle that unfortunately warned of things to come.  Entirely eschewing savories in favor of items far more sweet it was after perhaps a twenty minute wait that our proper order arrived and beginning first with a doughy Belgian topped with fresh berries beneath artificial tasting chocolate I quickly turned my attention to the alternatives, the Elvis faring a bit better by balancing sweet and savory over a slightly more study base while the \"Honey I'm Home\" proved the best of bunch in its sugar-crisp coating overlying a somewhat dense crumb - its \"veganism\" thoroughly compromised by honey and ice cream but the result all the better for it.",

I cannot believe how long it took to get my food...and the nice gal at the cashier took down my name incorrectly so after waiting an excruciating long time for my food, I wasn't sure if my name was being called. They keep calling \"Maria\" when my name is \"Nadia\"...I looked around and noticed no one was responding to \"Maria\" so I went up to the counter to clarify the name...With an attitude, one of the girls making a drink said \"isn't that what you  ordered?\" (as if the sandwich was exclusive to me alone)... I said \"yes, but before I take the food I want to make sure it's actually my order and not some Maria that could be nearby\". After taking the food I sat down and immediately overheard the same girls  gossiping about me, laughing and saying my name. Whatever. At least wait until the customer leaves to trash talk. The Thai sandwich was just okay. The waffle was too soft and when I bit into it it was unpleasantly soggy. It's been that way on each visit. The idea of a waffle sandwich is good, by if it isn't cooked crispy enough, it ends up tasting like dough. I think I'm going to scratch this place off my list.",

Being that I'm always in search for new and exciting places to experience, this place is now my goto coffee spot for the Vegas Road Trips.   If you love Belgian waffles, you will enjoy these.  They make the Vegan batter here in the premises.  I'm not Vegan, but I am for the period of time it takes to scarf one. They have many of sandwiches and desserts to choose from, all made with waffles, including the Churronimo(a waffle churro), which I wolfed down yesterday.    The coffee items that I've experienced so far are the Red Velvet Latte, speaks for itself, and the Espresso Frankenstein.  One would think the Frankenstein to be a very strong and intense drink, one would be correctamundo.  Four shots, ice, and agave, all blended together into a very light and frothy monster of a drink...don't be scared, try it!  Even though it's strong, it's not bitter strong.  You can really taste the roasted smoothness of the beans.   Yes TIABI has hit a home run with me.  The staff is lively, informative, accommodating and diligent.  To the owners Mae and Tiffany I thank you.",

The waffles itself reminded me of the HK egg waffle taste, except not as sweet.  For my drink I ordered a Dirty Mocha Chai. It came in a cute mason jar cup.

It's a subtly sweet, overly savory serving of food heaven layered in a healthy serving of cheese, chicken, and their very own Tiabi sauce all densely packed in a crispy yet soft waffle, usually accompanied with a side of deliciously flavored kettle chips (add $1.00).   I guess the only complaint I have is that the sandwich isn't big enough to satisfy my hunger, and at $5.79, I really wish it came with two waffledillas. Heck, I'd pay a little extra if there was a special two wafflewich combo. Make this happen, guys! There are too many times where I just end up ordering two anyways.",

I ordered the Strawberry Kisses waffle with vanilla ice cream. A thin, soft & warm waffle covered in strawberries, cream, ice cream, and chocolate is a great afternoon treat. They also offer vegan ice cream ;)   The space itself is cute and surely a spot you could hang out for a bit and read a book, but it might be more of a quick hang-out & eat spot than an all day hang out & work spot.   Can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu.",

This is a small feat considering how high my tolerance is for caffeine. I love it.   The atmosphere is great for having a conversation, grabbing some lunch, or lounging about and I love the Guam seal incorporated in the back drawing! Also, Tiffany the owner is often working along with the other baristas and is great to have a conversation with, always remembers me, and the other baristas are friendly as well.  My fiance loves their black coffee and waffles too. I am pretty sad that I'm not near UNLV all the time any more during the day so stopping by for now will have to be a treat but whenever I'm in the area I will make it a point to swing by!",

If you like more of a big fluffy pancake then this really isn't the place for you. The location of this place is a little weird it's almost like a hole in the wall.

Every combination of waffle you can buy is good, prices are fair, staff is super nice. There is also no waiter it's just a walk up order and you can sit and eat it in the restaurant with silverware. The coffees are so interesting and amazing we tried three different kinds, Java Jolt was my favorite. To make it even more appealing, the atmosphere inside is very hip and enjoyable to dine in.

I've had the avocado grilled cheese and a few other different sweet waffles too with ice cream  so good! I came here once with my mom and husband and used the groupon for 3 $8 vouchers. The next time I came in here my husband tried to use the vouchers and the guy with the cross earrings was really rude and aloof about the whole ordeal. He told us we couldn't use the three vouchers at the same time (last time we did three different transactions and lady was super nice and chipper). He said we could only use two in a visit, to which we replied ok no problem. We told him what order we wanted on the first voucher and he asked us for the next order. He tried to put the entire order under one voucher after we explained our situation. He didn't seem to understand what we were trying to do.   I usually love this place but during this visit, it was not a good time. I come in here even without the vouchers to spend money because I love this place. Unfortunately the last encounter left me with a sour taste.   Side note...if you're out of something for over a week (like all other flavors of ice cream) why not take it off the crumpled paper that you put all your flavors on? Or maybe cover it with a post it note? So all your patrons know you only have one flavor, vanilla.",

I asked the cashier about the latte, and she admitted to making a mistake of omitting the latte from our order. She asked if I still wanted it, she would have to ring me up.

    "text": "I used to hate waffles once upon a time. I've never been a breakfast gal, so waffles never tickled my fancy.  But in 2014,I found myself pregnant and working in Alaska. I happened upon a waffle house and ate there with my co-workers. They had the best pancakes I have ever had, with a ham and egg waffle that was divine.  Since then I've been on the hunt for a waffle that could compare. I thought maybe those waffles tasted good because I was pregnant, like how many foods taste better when under the influence of certain substances.  But I persisted. I have eaten at a few waffle places here in town and the waffles here are the best ones I have had yet. The maple bacon waffle reminded me so much of the waffle up in Alaska that it is all I can think about wanting for breakfast. The only thing that stops me is that I live in green valley and I already drive for a living so I avoid it at all costs.   COME HERE AND EAT THE WAFFLES. Take it from a formerly-pregnant-lady-turned-mom-who-used-to-hate-waffles-but-now-only-likes-the-really-really-really-good-ones.",

I used napkins to wipe them down.   Decor is boring.   Food didn't take long to come out, maybe 10 minutes.   We ordered a pistachio latte; delicious flavor, lightly sweetened with a beautiful nutty aftertaste.   Bananatella: these waffles are different from what I have had else where. They are on the thinner, slightly doughier side. Nice crunchy exterior and softness as you bite into it. The almonds on top added a nice texture to the bite. Fresh, firm banana slices.   Veggie breakfast sandwich: they use the same waffle for these sandwiches, which works great. The veggies were fresh, great tasting. No complaints.   We enjoyed this place but for $16.XX I don't think we will be coming back. I'm still hungry.",

I had the Elvis which includes banana, peanut butter, honey, agave nectar. It was the perfect waffle and portions are just big enough to be very satisfying, and not so massive as to be overwhelming.  My husband gobbled up his bacon infused waffle and exclaimed this place a solid 4!! Now this isa tough reviewer, who when he sees the word 'vegan' scrunches up his face and his head folds into his shoulders. This is huge!  I want to return for their blendies, smoothies with a great variety of ingredients, and the black lemonade which is infused with charcoal for digestion.  The cafe is cute and staff are super helpful.  You may find us here pretty often now!!",

We started with a maple bacon waffle. I really liked it but my wife said it tasted like an eggo waffle.   We both had a west coast sandwich despite it being \"breakfast\". Both really good. Warm waffle as the bread and creamy avocado with bacon and chicken unside-Yum!  We also both had coffee. I had a honey cream iced latte- awesome! My wife had a regular latte with sugar free caramel-also awesome! There coffee is amazing. No bitterness in our milk drinks for sure.   Overall we loved this place. Great coffee and pretty decent food. Me: 5/5. Wife:4/5. I round down.   We will be returning for sure!  Btw it is counter service but it was friendly and quick.",

The cashier was friendly took all my orders quickly there was only two working at the time so we were in no rush. The lay out of restaurant gives a nice mellow vibe has some pretty cool stuff on the walls....now on to the food. Lol  One of my coworkers and i got the Westcoast Wafflewich bannatella waffle maple bacon waffle and a veggie sandwhich peach ice tea redbull cider and tropical tea (i cant remember the whole name) While we were waiting the family before us had their order come out and their stuff looked amazing! So i became anxious to eat my wafflewhich before i got to the office. Anyways i get back unwrapped it took a bite and a chorus of hallelujah went through my head. It had the right amount of seasoning the waffle itself was nice and fluffy the chicken had seasoning it was just awesome and awesome doesnt even do it justice.  My friend loved her veggie wafflewhich and the whole office was happy about this place. Oh and the peach tea was good also. One thing is that if they could have an option of battered chicken to give a little crunch that would be good!",

As we pulled up we seen a Guam sticker proudly represented on the entry way! It made me feel proud to be a Chamorru but even prouder to see a small uniquely owned island business in sin city! Strange how this place stuck out and so happened to be of the same cultural background. Amazing customer service by the young lady and man who was working. She thoroughly explained good items in which we were interested in regardless of how many questions we threw at her. I myself being a server in the food industry know how tedious it could be. We ordered a few items off the menu!  Red velvet waffle  Maple and beacon waffle  Southwest waffle sandwich Banananutella And the Tia waffle iced mac. Coffee  All tasted lovely and reasonably priced! Go support a small island owned business!",

The lady noticed that I was vegan when I asked for almond milk with my mocha frappe and she gave me a heads up and let me know they use milk for the base so I ended up just drinking water instead (which is free, they have a cute little water station). I ended up ordering the guru burger and my boyfriend got the vegan wafflewich and we also decided to get the churronimo. It's a quick little breakfast bite but it was so good! I know I'll end up coming here from time to time now that I know about this place.",

    "text": "This place is really cute- the atmosphere is hip and eclectic, and they even have decks of cards to play with at the tables. The establishment is clean, and they have a few  yummy looking things for vegans on their menu. The staff is passionate and friendly, and I loved the small business vibe that it had.  I didn't personally have a great overall experience there, but I realize from other's reviews that my experience was definitely not the norm.  When my fiance and I ordered our food, I didn't think it would take much more than 20 minutes to get it on the table, but the guy working there did warn me that it might take a couple extra minutes. No big deal. After waiting about 45 minutes, I needed to leave for work but we had already paid for our food- which I found out hadn't even been started yet. There was only one other couple in the restaurant, so I went to find out what was going on. It turns out, the one person working there was filling a 30 sandwich catering order before making our 2 sandwiches. The owner/manager person came out to see what was wrong, and ended up basically yelling at her employee for not offering us a free upgrade to Belgian waffles so that he could use the other iron and get our sandwiches out quickly.  Now, yes, that would have been a smart thing to do, but what about the possibility of putting the only two waffles ordered in the last hour in front of the 30 catered waffles? Or the possibility of not charging for the meal we had to take to go and I still ended up late for work? Or at the very least not chewing out your employee for a unfortunately handled circumstance that could not have possibly been covered during training?   Also the manager/owner lady was worried that I would give her a bad review on yelp, and kept bringing it up and asking that the employee's mistake wouldn't cost her a good review. I don't go on yelp just to give people bad reviews, but it's not often that I have an experience this bad either.  The sandwiches and coffee themselves were absolutely fabulous, and since the service was definitely situational, I would not be opposed to going back sometime to give it another shot. Even more than being late for work and not getting any sort of complimentary item as an apology, I just really don't appreciate the lack of professionalism that the management showed the day I went in. I've been in situations where my boss embarrassed me in front of customers before, and it's really the worst thing.  But like I said, it was just a poorly handled situation, and the food was so dang good that I would not be opposed to giving them a second chance- I'm just not chomping at the bit to walk through those doors again.",

He said the were slammed and the coffee would be up soon . Seriously??  It was regular non fancy coffee !?  It finally came 10 mins after we got the waffles.  Coffee was like warm and the waffles weren't very good .   Oh  and there were maybe 14 people in this place, and 7 of them was our family !",

    "text": "It's been a while since I wrote a review, but I wanted to write one about my favorite cafe - TIABI.  TIABI - \"To Inspire And Be Inspired\". I discovered this little place through a student organization at UNLV. They are super close to campus and an excellent place to \"be inspired,\" in my case this is the only place where I know I can sit down and focus on writing and studying. I've been here several times already and have accomplished so much (yelping reviews is the bottom of my list up until now).   First, the only downside I can mention is that there is only one wall outlet (that I know) where I can plug in. That little area has become my personal spot. Other than that, I thoroughly love this venue.  Location/Open times: TIABI is down the street from UNLV. It is in a secluded area of the Target shopping plaza right next to a great sushi place. As a potential schoolteacher, the 7am open time is right when I have to get to class but it is open until 8pm on most days making it a good place to have breakfast on my off days, lunch, or chillax after class/work.  Aesthetics: Local art, waffle \"hashtags\" everywhere, a couple of couches and sturdy tables and seating. The wired art light fixtures  add a nice rustic look (though they tend to accumulate dust quickly). Nothing is too distracting, and I can zone into my work or a conversation easily. Their playlists are provided by Pandora and varies by the people working, but I have enjoyed the musical tastes of the staff thus far, ranging from islander to indie.  Food: In the words of a lego dude, \"EVERYTHING IS AWESOME!!\" There are plenty of options, especially health and allergy conscious, handcrafted on the spot. I have always enjoyed that \"fresh\" taste and have never suffered a regretful feeling leaving (as is sometimes the case with Chipotle or even Starbucks). As I am writing this review, I am having their red velvet waffle (so sweet and delectable) paired with a new beverage, the Frankenstein frappe, a cool and refreshing drink lightly sweetened with agave but not so much as to overpower the taste of the coffee. I am enjoying myself and am getting my morning kick (which is why I can write).   Service: The owners, Tiff and Mae, are both super awesome and have taken care of me on numerous occasions. Their staff are just as kind and sociable, and I haven't had a problem striking up a conversation as I am often here alone. I feel as welcome as sitting at a desk in my own living room. I'm surprised that not as many people come to just hang out, but I'm certain that will change as more people come to know about TIABI.  I like small hole-in-the-wall local places, and I feel especially at home at this one. Hope this review was inspiring!",

My family and I make a semi annual trip from CA every year...and we usually always settle for the renowned hotel buffets. This time however I decided to change that, and we stumbled on this location for breakfast.  I was fascinated with the originality of their menu, especially with waffles. Savory or sweet...many different options were available to satisfy. I appreciated that this restaurant was vegan friendly for my own personal choice. But my family loved it as well. Although a little pricey, the food we ordered  was indeed very filling and delicious. Anticipate an average wait time as they make the vegan waffles by scratch.   The restaurant itself had a very welcoming cafe environment. And the employees were kind.   I highly recommend the visit and the try the Waffledilla and the Twilight Lavender Latte! Heaven!",

On this particular visit 3-7-16 I believe one of the owners was in the store because the staff was not as warm and friendly as in the past.  There was a totally different vibe in here then in the past 3 or 4 visits.  Not sure what was going on but the food was still amazing, the drinks were amazing and this is a place I not only highly recommend but will come back to as well.  To me this is one of those places you just cannot seem to get enough of.  You can get breakfast or lunch stuff anytime and you always leave satisfied.",

We sat and perused the menu for a while and I was a little disappointed that no one really checked on us or even asked if we wanted waters or more menus than just the one for our group of three. We finally figured out what we wanted and went up to the counter to order.  The lady behind he counter kept interrupting my dining companion as he started to order by yelling behind to another person who worked there. I thought that was a little rude, so that definitely put me off.  Our food took a while to come, but it looked really pretty.   What we ordered: -red velvet wafflenut  -Nutella and almond wafflenut  -The Fat Elvis waffle -Strawberry and chocolate waffle -Vegas churro waffle with honey, cinnamon, sugar and vanilla ice cream  Everything was solid. The consensus was that the churro waffle was the favorite and I personally enjoyed the strawberry waffle, minus the chocolate sauce.   Service needs work and the location is awkward, so I don't see myself making much effort to come back to this place in the future.",

Today I tried the Waffledilla and that's my new favorite sandwich, with the sweet fluffy waffle and savory inside it hits the spot!  Love the trendy coffeehouse atmosphere, music and friendly staff. I would give 4 and a half stars if I could.  After more perfect visits I will give them 5!",

Another crappy-overpriced hipster wanna-be \"cafe\" . . .  chalkboard paint, hand-drawn menu, attractive employees that are smiling. Dammit. I reluctantly ordered the Vegan Waffle-\"burger\", with a side of peanut sauce, for 6 bucks. For 6 bucks, that's amazingly cheap for Vegas. Ok, then I added the Frankenstein and my friend ordered. A Steel Pulse song came on the overhead, and now, breakfast for two, was under $20. Yes. This, is what is up. Definitely my new go to spot.",

    "text": "OK, this is a lengthy review.  here's a summary:  The wait is FOREVER.  If you're disabled or in a hurry, skip it.  If you're fully-abled with plenty of time on your hands, Tiabi is probably worth the wait.  Now for the actual review:  This place is very popular - there wasn't an empty seat in the house.  This is a problem for me as I'm disabled.  I was feeling halfway decent today and decided to take my daughter out for a (long overdue) mommy/daughter date, since I don't get to do that very often.  We went inside and stared at the menu for a few minutes.  It's big and on the wall near the front of the store, which is convenient.  After deciding what we wanted, I walked around to find the area for placing an order.  There are 3 sections where the counter is open, so they all appear to be there for communicating with the people behind the counter.  After examining the other items at the counter (there's stuff everywhere), however, it wasn't obvious where to stand to place an order.  One of the staff members saw the lost look on my face and directed me to the right place.  Once there I noticed an ipad on the counter which I assume they use to take orders.  We moved to the appropriate counter spot (which is at the front of the store, by the menu), and then waited to be helped.  I was able to wait for 10 minutes, but that's when my back issues kicked in.  In that time, we were given an apology, but no other eye contact or acknowledgement.  I got the impression that they were overwhelmed and didn't WANT to take anymore orders.  I've worked in retail and food service, so I know how that that is.  It was probably a blessing that they didn't take my order, as I wouldn't have been capable of standing around much longer to wait for the food.  In their defense, all 3 employees were shuffling around and working very hard.  The place was just seriously understaffed.  They could've used AT LEAST 2 more people today.  Since my back issues don't allow me to stand for extended periods of time, I hate to say that I won't be able to return to this establishment.  For anyone in the same boat - having limited physical abilities - I'd suggest ordering Tiabi for delivery if you live close enough, or just try a different waffle bar.  The one at Tivoli has plenty of seating and wasn't busy when I went.  I was very disappointed.  My young daughter was VERY excited to try some new and desserty waffles.  It kills me to get that far into the process, only to break her heart and go somewhere else.  It also sucks because I'm usually in too much pain (or too medicated) to even leave the house.  So when I do leave the house, every minute counts and is very special to me.  Don't take your good health for granted!!!!!!!!  Not entirely related, but worth noting:  Across the street from Tiabi, the wash runs between Toys R Us and Seafood City.  This part of the wash spawns a lot of water pokemon, which are hard to find elsewhere in the desert.  I kinda wish I could leave a review without giving a star rating.  Although I couldn't try the food, it's obviously good.  They wouldn't have been that busy if they weren't doing something right.  I just REALLY REALLY REALLY wish the owners would staff it better, or maybe expand or something.  We aren't all fully-abled college students with the ability to wait around all day.  I also want to mention that I'm NOT the type of person who expects everyone to cater to ME and my specific needs.  My belief - no matter what side of the counter I'm on - is that if your customers are important to you, you don't make them wait more than 2 minutes to be rung up.",

    "text": "My TIABI experience was top notch! It's locally owned by these two young girls from Guam who works there too. Mae is one of the owner & greeted us with a genuine smile. She gave us recommendations for a health nut like me and I was not disappointed! I always opt for the gluten free options and I tried their Hashtag Waffle with turkey sausage & eggs- it was delicious!!! My friend had the West Coast Waffle that had bacon, chicken, avocado with their TIABI sauce & she was speechless! The waffles had the right amount of crunchiness & sweetness at the same time- & the portions are huge! We had the Kale Champ (kale, bananas, orange, almond milk) & Tif's Waffle Macchiato that came with a cute tiny churro waffle with the drink (like an umbrella in cocktail drinks but you can eat the waffle & dip it in your coffee- yum!). Kale Champ was a champ! No bitterness & just a tad sweetness. The macchiato- Wow! Smooth, aromatic with a hint of cinnamon. The price is very reasonable- where can you have gourmet coffee or shakes with an out of this world waffle entree for just a little over $10 bucks?!  The place is simple with a local vibe touch to the interior- chalk board with cute drawings, a locker that has graffiti signatures from customers, and couches to relax or study. It's right next to Target near UNLV.  We came here after our Spartan race yesterday because we were craving for some good waffles. We heard about this place from the locals & drove there from the race site as fast as we could without getting a speeding ticket :-) We were still wearing our medals. It was such a perfect place to celebrate another successful Spartan race!",
