The food took literally 30 - 40 mins to get on the table, my crab was very blah and the menu is pricey. I truly don't mind paying more but the food has to be at least good. Bottom line the food ruin my night, it made me sick. In Vegas for my friend's bday and couldn't go out and party bc the bathroom was my best friend. No wonder SW was packed and Lakeside was not. Don't was your time or money. #totallyfail #gameoverfridaynight :(",

    "text": "This place was good, but not as good as I expected, given that it's (a) in the Wynn, and (b) pretty expensive.   I came with a party of 5 late on a weekday evening in January, so there was no trouble getting seated immediately.  I think the total bill for all 5 came out to somewhere around $300 with tip and most people did not have a full, multi-course meal.  A few people had 1-2 glasses of wine, and I think there were a couple of appetizers and desserts along with each person's entree.  The good - Lakeside Grill has both vegetarian and vegan items.  That's great when you have a variety of diets in your group.  Unfortunately, the menu as a whole is pretty small.  I wasn't asking for Cheesecake Factory menu-length by any means, but it would have been nice to have a few more choices.  I ended up sharing the mushroom risotto and truffle pizza with a friend.  Both were amazing, but the pizza should have been called \"Onion Pizza with Truffles\" rather than a truffle pizza.  The onions were completely distracting, and the pizza would have been about a million times better without them.  The risotto was delicious - not like the \"Rice a Roni\" tastealikes you get at most places.  Dessert was not quite as good, unfortunately.  I had 2 of their small desserts - a peanut butter cup thing and a s'mores dessert.  Although they were pretty good, they tasted a lot like stuff you'd get over at the Wynn Buffet.  I was hoping the s'mores dessert would be gooier, and that the peanut butter cup dessert would at least be possible to eat with the spoons they brought.  Neither one was silverware-friendly at all, which made for some awkward dining moments.  The atmosphere was great, albeit a little cheesy and weird when the giant Max Headroom-style head was being projected out over the water.    My only major complaint was that the service was surprisingly bad for the price range of the meal.  Our waiter was extremely bad at reading signals (like all menus closed, making eye contact, etc.) and the delays in service easily added at least 30-45 minutes to the length of the meal.  Even paying was difficult, as they guy basically stopped coming around after we received our entrees.  We had to flag down someone else for dessert menus, and to order, and again to get the check.  They dragged our guy back to us, but you really shouldn't have to go to that much trouble when you're eating at a place with caviar on the menu.",

A little disappointed by the beer selection.  Ended up switching to Wine when my meal came.  The food wasn't terrible, but wasn't great either.  I had the Crisp Dover Sole.  Being from New England I expected a lot more for $58.  The presentation was great, but fish itself  was strange, I'm not sure if the sole was wrapped around another fish but the flavor was definitely not quite right.  The saving grace of this restaurant was the Vegan Menu for my Fiancee.  She loved the fact that she could get a truly vegan meal with protein and she had options.    After dinner we saw La Reve(WOW amazing) and had a great breakfast the next morning at another Wynn restaurant.",

The cocktail sauce was just wet. I had the steak and i ordered it medium. Im pretty sure the steak was still moving when it came out. When i asked for the steak to be cooked a little more, the server said he'd grab it but noone ever came to get it. Im assuming they thought it would cook while its on the table. The steak was small so people were finishing up their meals so i decided just to what wasn't bloody. The desert was lackluster and then the bill came out. They charged us for the max amount of people because they already \"bought\" the food...most ridiculous thing ive ever heard in a restaurant. Like they had to make a special order for food when we made reservations. We cleary stated it was reservations for between 20-25 people not knowing we'd be charged for people not showing up. We had 22 people. Go figure, save your money and eat at the mexican place next to strip burger. The food went right through me, worst $180 ever spent. That was per person by the way, you'd imagine the service would be better at that point!",

I was prepared to pay for a good dinner, not a 58 dollar plate with 3 gigantic fake tasting shrimp that were swimming in a tomato sauce that tasted like it was from a jar from the local neighborhood market. Our salads tasted and looked like they were from Denny's or something alike. Yes, the patio looked nice and the decor was entertaining, but IMHO the place and the food were over rated. The next night we dined at La Cave, it was much better!",

    "text": "So, part 2 of my conference stint in Vegas. After Bradley Ogden -that somber cave- we ate on the next night, Sunday at 8 pm, at the Lakeside Grill in the Wynn. A completely different atmosphere. The space was occupied by Daniel Bouloud last time I was in Vegas. A prime spot in a luxurious hotel. Bouloud is obviously gone (mmmm, wonder why?) and now it is the Lake Side Grill. The restaurant was half empty that evening like Ogden, and we still did not order any alcohol, but we immediately got taken care of. And courteously so. The decor in the restaurant is refreshingly perky (orange and white) in that \" tasteful over the top \" Vegas oxymoronic way ( Vegas can be so quaint, ah ah!). A note on the ladies' bathroom: what an amazing cocoon, lovely and precious, with just enough glitter to make a lady feel grand.  The hostess placed us at a fabulous table on the terrace overlooking the man-made \"lake\" and its \"waterfall\": a luxury we keenly enjoyed. The service was friendly and at the same time very professional, sprinkled with discreet touches of personalized care ( I requested an ingredient should be taken out of the quinoa dish and another added, and both wishes were granted to me after consultation with the chef. Yeah, power, baby! The exchange felt mature and not phony.) My co-worker and I shared a fois gras appetizer that was just scrumptious (don't hate us) . His main course grilled chicken was juicy and plump. My quinoa was tasty. On the dessert menu, lo and behold, we spotted a Strawberry Napoleon, like at Ogden's, so we ordered it to compare; I don't know if it was the atmosphere, or the decor, or the great service, but it tasted fresher and more flavorful than the Bradley O. one. Atmosphere, baby, is everything.  We ended up spending 2 leisurely hours on that terrace, basking in the peace of the \"lake\" landscape placed in front of us by the Wynn architects' s crazed imagination. Every half hour, I think, some electronic 3-minute show pops up to animate the waters for the diners' enjoyment. Some of it was silly but inoffensive, and some of it unexpectedly touching, like a Pixar cartoon. Nor here nor there: it was a full experience, and a very pleasant one.  And I loved -LOVED- being de facto outdoors on that terrace, enjoying the night's natural desert heat. When are Vegas' powers going to learn that there is nothing pleasant about being stuck in a dark corner of a freezing casino eating under fluorescent lights, when sunshine beckons all around?",

Service was impressive and food was better than expected.

My only complaint is that food came out a tad bit under on all orders (fish and meat).  Desserts need improvements.  This place fills up and dinning on the 2hour interval   food- king crab & guacamole- ok, good amount of crab, but flavors lost and muddled by the odd and slightly difficult to handle presentation  fried calamari-pretty good.  fresh and crunchy.  nice flavor  rib eye 20oz-nice and juicy!  small bone and a bit of gristle.  Ordered med rare, but felt more rare than what i was use to.   orange glazed salmon-good.  nice and moist.  asked for well done, but came out under possibly to save the fish.    sides-nothing to be desired.  ordered something that had roasted Brussels spouts and was ok people who ordered fries received large portions",

When I mentioned that it was a little cold outside the hostess asked if I would like a wrap.  I said yes and she returned immediately.  That is where the great service ended. We waited over 5 minutes for a someone to come and take our drink order, during that time we were not even offered water.  Once our drinks arrived we did order our dinner but had to wait to do that as well. The soap was OK and my husband enjoyed his salad.   Apparently this restaurant is known for it's seafood.  Guess mine missed the boat.  My fish was dry and tasteless.   My husband did enjoy his steak - image that a good steak at a seafood restaurant.  When the waiter came to clear our table he asked my how mine was and I said that it was actually very dry.  His comment can I bring you something else?  Don't you think that if during our meal he had of stopped by it would have been more appropriate and I could of told him at that point and he could of fixed it then?  I said no thank you we need to be leaving and to that he returned with our bill - no discount, no nothing.  Summary, nice hostess, poor poor food, poor service, nice atmosphere but I don't go to a restaurant that charges what it did for poor service, poor food and nice atmosphere.  I would prefer great service, great food and OK atmosphere.  Won't be returning there.",

It was extremely uncomfortable, I finally asked our waiter to do something- the manager stood behind us  listening to him drop F bomb after F bomb, calling each other names out loud. She finally saw me say this is ridiculous, and asked them to quiet down. By this time I was fuming. Our food came during this 30 min fiasco, was not enjoyable by any means. The server was embarrassed, I told the manager she let it go on WAY too long. Our check comes- 245.00, didn't offer desert, or anything!  I will never take anyone to this restaurant again. Very unprofessional of the manager. I worked in this business in the past, I would have comped the entire meal since we had no alcohol on it. Just a terrible night. My customer and I didn't get to talk, we could only talk about how bad that situation was handled. Very disappointed.",

We had reservations and were seated out on the patio by Natalia, who was a friendly helpful hostess, with whom I bantered a bit with about wishing there was no smoking allowed on the patio.    Our server was Vince and he provided excellent, efficient and affable service throughout the meal.   It was also nice that Richard the manager dropped by and chatted and made us feel very welcome.  I told him that some reviews on Yelp have been kind of negative and he acknowledged the issue and we both realized that it's hard to control opinions on a public forum like Yelp.    But regarding some of those complaints about slow or poor service, our experience was exactly the opposite.  We had superb service throughout our evening.  We started with the crab/avocado salad and the shrimp cocktail, My favorite of the two was the shrimp, though the shrimp crackers that came with my wife's crab/avocado were super tasty.   Our entree was halibut for me and scallops for my wife.  I asked that my halibut be cooked simply without sauce or embellishment and this was done to my satisfaction with simple butter and lemon. This time, I think my wife's sea scallops were my favorite.  They were super sweet and very tender.  Not that my halibut wasn't lovely, it's just that I liked the scallops a bit more.  Sides were asparagus and fried mushroom rice.  This mushroom rice was very good and made a great side.  For dessert we went all out and had a super sundae, and man-oh-man, this was over the moon and over the top good.  So rich, so decadent, so yummy.   Again, we were very pleased with our dinner at Lakeside and like all the Wynn/Encore restaurants this one is top notch.    I know there are lots of other places in town, but as you can tell from some of my recent reviews we have become Wynn regulars and we couldn't be any happier.",

    "text": "We dined here at Lakeside on Saturday night with two other couple. It's located inside Wynn right across the SW steakhouse. This Restuarant is beautiful & has a waterfall outside. They played a laser show every 20 min or so. It was so nice. The lighting & the colors of the restuarant is just perfect. The bathrooms are so nice with orange sink. Very unique & trendy ambiance.  They have the Rib Eye Glatt Kosher steak!!!! I personally asked to see it, it was sealed & had the OU sign. I was so happy that they had this service.   We ordered the Glatt kosher Rib-eye steak, the black bass & 2 of our friends ordered the regular steak with chili & crab on it. All dishes were very delicious. Mine was a bit more well-done than what I wanted it to be but I was so happy I was having kosher steak in a Restuarant like that with the beautiful ambiance, I didn't care at all. Usually when we go to restaurants, my husband & I are forced to get sea food because they don't have a kosher option. We just have to sit & watch our friends eating their yummy steak while we eat our boring salmon!! So the fact that we could have our kosher steak with everyone else was just priceless.  I also heard all restaurants at Wynn have vegetarian & vegan menu.  For desert, we ordered the coffee creme brulee (very unique), orange chocolate & macadamia donut with tea & coffee. The desert was so delicious. Perfect amount of sweetness. Not too sweet.  We asked to be seated outside for the desert part so we can watch the waterfall show better. Jason, our waiter was so nice, respectful & he made that happen. The service was outstanding, I highly recommend this place & will go back to it next time I go to Vegas.",

Both of us ordered steak and admittedly, were not understanding what add-ons meant so, we opted for bleu cheese gratin and didn't know that meant steak with melted cheese on top. Whatevs..call us hicks or ghetto..we just didn't know and I felt SO bad, as I was the one that suggested we add that on to my man's ribeye and..then it came and the steak was smothered and I was like BOO! But, my filet mignon was naked, charred/grilled and naked! I wish it tasted better.. the meatiness was not easy to cut into.. I'm used to filet with butterknife texture and this was more like.. I dunno..jagged meat!  It was such a turn off, I ended up switching steaks with my husband..and by then he was so fucking wasted he had NO idea I switched things up on him!  Side dish of mashed potatoes was good and our waiter was hella swanky and was ON IT for all our needs.  If I'm back in Vegas, would I come here? Nah.. nah.. But, it wasn't bad.. just not actually worth it. We had better meals in the Wynn/Encore properties and for the same price.",

We initially tried to sit on the patio, which was lovely but unfortunately allows smoking, so we went indoors.   Our server was really put off that we were only there for dessert. He gave us the menus when we requested, but didn't give us a wine list, and immediately went over to another server to complain to her about us. It was less than a foot away and she rolled her eyes.  This was uncomfortable; should we leave? The server brought us our wine, but spilled dessert wine over the side of my husband's glass and grinned about it instead of apologizing.   The dessert and wine were wonderful and well made, but it was really uncomfortable and upsetting to be there when our server kept glaring at us from across the room. He did not check to see if we needed anything. I'm a bit disappointed by the service, since I was told this was a good restaurant. We probably won't go back.",

The entire party was present.  A 15 minute wait was given, which turned into over 45 minutes to nearly an hour before, because it was a professional business dinner, the host of the party who made the reservations felt embarrassed enough to have his clients wait and wait and wait that he had to take issue with the front desk to which the squeaky wheel I guess got the oil and we were seated.  An apology gesture of a free appetizer was given in lieu of their tardy seating.  The food overall was good, it's a bit expensive, especially The Lobster.

Do something different than steamed or as a thermidor, to show off the flavor differences... Something...  Crustaceans are delicious, and have different and unique flavor profiles. I'm probably in the minority, but I think I would have rather seen them showcased and prepared so the differences popped, rather than leaving it up to us to pick out the subtle nuances in our typical/favored preparation.

The service was top notch, the Sommelier knew his shit and they've got several bottles for under 100. Oh, in the lounge theres a chick with fake boobs (duh) that will play anything that you request.  Just like SW you can see the lake and the shows if you go after 7:30. The Lakeside mojito was excellent as well, but pretty steep, 15 bucks. Pretty standard prices though if you're drinking in Vegas.",

I really liked how the kitchen was visible but blocked by glass to prevent noise.   As for the food, I ordered South African lobster stuffed with crabmeat and carrots & peas as a side dish. The lobster was a very big serving, and cooked perfectly. The only reason I can not give a five star review is for price. I feel that everything was a bit over-priced. Perhaps it had to help put that huge rock on Steve Wynn's new wife's finger. :)",

Our server was attentive and took the time to talk scotch with me so i always appreciate that.  The food was great, i got the prime rib, my girlfriend got the swordfish which i was glad i didn't get.  It is a little pricey but if you sit outside you get your money's worth in atmosphere (besides the middle-aged women who were having their birthday dinner a couple tables away and they all decided to relive their youth and order shots).  if you dont want to have dinner or are more cost conscious, then go to the bar upstairs and order a drink or two there.  they have chairs and an outdoor patio where you can watch the show as well. OH, MAKE RESERVATIONS!",

    "text": "We decided to start our night with dinner here as my fellow diners had already tried several of the other restaurants at the Wynn.   The atmosphere was wonderful - peaceful, calm and serene yet refined and elegant. We sat on the terrace overlooking the \"mini-lake\" and waterfall were entertained every half hour or so with a 3-minute show emerging from behind the waterfall. The first one was a frog singing Louis Armstrong - yes, you heard that right - even at the height of classiness, this is still Vegas. The second feautured two glowing orbs that danced around the lake before giving birth to a baby orb - again, yes, you heard that right - although mostly an adult-centric atmosphere, I could just hear any children who may happen to see this choosing that moment to ask, \"Mommy, where do babies come from?\"  But I digress. The first thing that impressed me about the food itself was the fact that they were able to bring gluten free and vegan bread, as well as vegan butter, to the table upon our request. I've been to places where you could order a sandwich on gluten free bread, etc., but never had that option as part of a bread basket that has been brought to the table prior to the meal. It wasn't bad, as GF breads go, either.   My main course of scallops was absolutely delicious. The scallops were fresh and perfectly sauteed and the celery root puree, apple chutney and vandouvan sauce that came with were all excellent. My fellow diners seemed to really enjoy their meals, as well.  Overall this place is on the pricey side but the atmosphere is amazing and the service was perfect. My water and wine glasses were never left empty and all of our requests were attended to promptly and professionally. Definitely an enjoyable and relaxing experience.",

The setting in front of the Wynn waterfall is great and a lot of fun to watch the show every 30 minutes. But the food was just average. They bring a giant cage of lobsters out...which our painfully overpriced...115$ a pound hahaha! Oh by the way they only have lobsters over 3 pounds. They pride themselves on being the only restaurant on the strip with south Australian lobster...well when you charge that much it's not doing you any good!! I've had those same lobsters shipped to my house for half that price! The bread they bring you is pretty good, I love pretzel bread. We had oysters on the half shell...they were just okay. My husband had swordfish which was pretty tasty and the lobster poutine which was the star of the meal!! I had Maine lobster which was just okay. They split it for you so you don't have to do any work. We also ordered Brussels sprouts, they were very undercooked. Drink selection was good.  When we called to make reservations they told us gentlemen must be wearing ties and slacks. That's fine...except we got there and people were on shorts and a polo. You can't have a dress code and then not enforce it, my husband would have been more comfortable in other attire, but we wanted to ensure we didn't get turned away. Turns out they don't turn anyone away- super but tell people that!!!  Tons of other options in Vegas, go somewhere else!",

    "text": "I have to say, it is is extremely difficult for me to write a review with 2 stars but I was completely underwhelmed by my experience at Lakeside Grill. I'd like to give it maybe 2.5 stars for the fact that I love the Wynn for most of its venus, and I was happy mostly with the food when dining at Lakeside.   We're frequent diners about town and really wanted to go someplace neither of us had been. (Between the two of us, that's few and far between:) We decided on Lakeside because we both really dig the Wynn property and wanted to give the old space where 'Daniel Boulud' once was a try.   It started to get a bit wonky beginning with reservations. We went to 'OpenTable.Com' to make a reservation for 9pm. Apparently the 'Restaurant Week' menu we wanted to try was only available after 930, and would end at 1030pm. (Though numerous websites with the 'Restaurant Week' menus stated that many of the started at 6pm...) The menu was priced at $50.11 per person and offered 3 courses. The choices wern't so spectacular, but we figured we would add on to the menu if needed.   [sidenote: For some reason, when trying to reserve on OpenTable, the website would not allow us to make a reservation later than 715pm. I then called and the hostess at Lakeside moved it to 9pm for us. ]  Ok so 845pm rolls around, we head to the bar to have a couple of Stoli martinis ($28.50) and waited for our table. We were seated around 910pm after we indicated we would like to sit on the patio since it was a nice evening.  We get outside to a table nearly in the doorway and looked around for something else. All other tables for 2 were taken, so we stuck with it. Here's where it started to get bad.   The table was directly downwind from the 'Parasol Down' bar terrace that sat in the water next to us. MUCH cigar smoke was blowing in my direction as a result. With the door from the restaurant open, it was tolerable due to the draft from inside the restaurant.. so I dealt with it. Then the server closed the door to the restaurant. lol.. I asked if he could re-open it, to which he told me he had to ask his manager. The door never got re-opened. My friend even decided to take a Benadryl to combat the allergy she has to crappy cigarette smoke ;|  We wern't  trying to make issues so we dealt, as the smoke had started to subside due to a breeze. THEN a guy in a seat directly behind me began to literally chain smoke. A guy in the restaurant where we were eating.. This guy was lighting up like he was in a contest. Cigarette after cigarette.. im like.. ok dude, you win.. stop! It was so bad.  This pretty much began the ruin for me. Due to new laws voted into existence by the residents in Jan 2007.. smoking is banned in all establishments which sell food other than prepackaged snacks. Im pretty sure at nearly $100 a head, this is not a prepackaged snack kind of establishment. I was getting less tolerant.   * Then the very nice bread basket arrived that included warm fig rolls and that kept me quiet for a bit :) The food started to arrive and we enjoyed the 'King Crab Guacamole' we ordered to add on to our tasting menu. It was excellent!  Crisp, rice-like tortillas sprinkled with what tasted like Togoroshi spice accompanied a very well seasoned and tasty guacamole that was accented with sweet corn. Very light, very good. This was  the best part of the meal.   My friend and I both had caesar salads as the first course on the tasting menu.. and they were so-so.. pretty basic caesar and that was it. You can't expect too much from a caesar salad, and you wern't going to get much from the presentation of these.  Boring at best. The other choice was a crab cake, and I have had my fill of those.. so caesar it was. (should of had the crab cake)  Her petit filet mignon garnished with a potato slice arrived, my swordfish with tomato sofrito came, both cooked perfectly and very tasty. No sides to accompany, but we were filling up right about now, so that was ok.   The food at this point was very good. My friend even noted that whatever they are paying the grill guy, it wasn't enough.. because of the quality of the grilling. It really was excellent.   From this point on, it was mini desserts offered with the tasting menu (a chocolate bar and a buffet-style piece of caramel cheesecake), 2 luke-warm, very short shots of espresso that we ordered, and just disappointment after disappointment. No check-backs from the server on any course, nothing to write home about for most of the meal and alot of smoke.   I don't know what else to say.. it was a less than stellar dining experience. I know that having dined at many Wynn establishments, it's not usually something I regret.. but this was just bad. I don't see myself rushing back. The bill was just under $250 and was sort of disappointing for the price.   Maybe it was an off night, maybe it was that most of the staff seems to be under 25 and inexperienced, but overall it was nearly a fail situation. Sorry! Better Luck to you!",

    "text": "We try to come to Las Vegas at least a few times a year.  Although we generally stay at the Venetian, I make a point of researching the best restaurants before we arrive as the fine dining and concerts are what Vegas is all about for us.   There are a few restaurants that we dine at each time we are in town.  Although this was our first visit to the Lakeside, it has made \"the list\" and we will be returning in the future.  We asked specifically to have a nice table outside by the lake and it was spectacular!  The temperature was perfect and it was a wonderful experience.  I think that the only restaurant that can really top the view is the Eiffel Tower.  And while we had an amazing view at the Eiffel Tower the previous night, it was very hot and stuffy there.  The Lakeside was far superior.  (Likewise, we were at Delmonico's several nights ago and our \"view\" was an exit sign near the door even though the restaurant was not crowded and we will not be back.) When you are paying $100 per person, you truly want the whole ambiance of the restaurant to be perfect.  Our waiter, Douglas, was superb.  He was knowledgeable in suggesting a wine when I asked for a dry, \"oak-type\" white wine.  He was helpful in every way and went with the flow when I engaged him in conversation.  He suggested that the side dishes were quite large and I appreciated this information.  The entire staff was excellent and even the waiter who brought the bread and other amenities was THE BEST.  I have to state that the Lakeside has the most unique and delicious breads of any restaurant we have eaten at in Las Vegas.  Their raisin bread was AMAZING!  Additionally, I had one of the most enjoyable appetizers consisting of an Alaskan King  Crab/Guacamole combination.  It was excellent!  My main entree was jumbo shrimp and they were huge.  Moreover, the restaurant fulfilled my every request when I asked for specific ingredients    on the side.    The Lakeside also has some of the most unique (and yummy!) side dishes.  We had a scallop/shrimp fried rice dish and an Alaskan King Crab type of macaroni dish.  Both were superb!  The dessert menu was extensive, but nothing really grabbed my attention so we decided to pass on it.  I know if we had not been so full that we might have sampled it, however.  The ONLY criticism that I had of the restaurant was that they do have the fresh lobsters on a cart and wheel them to your table to help with enticing you to order the lobster.  Although I love the taste of lobster, I personally don't like being their \"executioner\" and having to look at them.  I realize that this is simply good form, but I just found it to be really sad.    The Lakeside is a marvelous restaurant that lives up to its reputation in every way.  I spoke with the Manager and it was clear that she values the feedback from diners.  The place is exquisite without being pretentious, yet is impeccable in following fine dining etiquette.  However, when their diners are of a more relaxed persuasion, they have no trouble adapting.  It has my highest recommendation.",

There are 5 shows running every half an hour. From Louie Armstrong to Rachmaninov's Vocalize presented through visual effects and dancing flowers and singing frogs. Take a seat outside and enjoy while dining. Now to the food. The menu is pricy but worth it. You can find anything you like from steak to lobster. We  shared Main Lobster and few sides. Compared to other place this was enough for two of us and we did not finish the sides: sauteed mushrooms and lobster potatoes with mozzarella. The bottom line is the food is great. Wine and drink list is vast and quite expensive, so If you have a couple of hundred dollars to spend you can get a decent bottle. We decided to go by the glass and ended up with California Cab and French Pinot. The service was impeccable and we ha an overall great experience for only $210 including tip. The place os pricy so be prepared. Other vise this is the place in Vegas!",

Let me start off by saying the computer systems were down when we arrived so we were lucky enough to have one of the gentleman managers helping out our server. Sterling insisted on taking our cocktail orders and gave a full breakdown of their menu. Lakeside (as well as all the other Wynn properties) offers an exquisite menu for vegan guests (I am pretty sure you have to request the separate  menu). Not only do they offer a variety of options but they even brought separate bread and butter options for the one vegan in our party. As most vegans know the options at most restaurants are very limited, but the Wynn is taking Vegan life to an entire new level!! I am no longer vegan, and opted for some of the fish dishes, but the highlight of our dinner was the Vegan Beef Wellington!  The puff pastry on this thing was cooked to perfection and the gravy was salty and delicious.  Yes, I do expect great things from the Wynn, but Lakeside exceeded our expectations. Thank you to Sterling and his staff for allowing us to have such a wonderful dinner!!! Can't wait to go back for that Beef Wellington!!!",

All good but when we got there they kept making us aware our bill was gonna be short and really it felt like they thought we didn't have money? Imagine ordering something and the waiter turning to your friend \"the host\" and asking them if what your ordering is ok? I paid $500 of the bill by the way numbnuts. And a couple of us asked to see a desert menu but they said it would take 20min for them to be ready and wasn't available,so we just drank and ordered drinks until we met our quota? Needless to say when we left 45 min later after we spent $3k and didn't even get offered a dessert.  We looked around at different steakhouses, and chose Lakeside for menu, availability and it was owned by same as the SW. We made the wrong choice and this is for the people unsure of where to go looking for a genuine review and I'd recommend another restaurant. We will spend our money at a different place for the next conference.  Also for the manager I'd suggest using docusign for your contract we had to find a Fedex while we were out just to reserve the table.",

Love the appetizers, we had grilled octopus and Alaska king crab they were excellent. We both ordered the Dover sole for our main entree, as we both love Dover sole.  My husband was fine with it but I didn't like the way  it was perapared, with a breadcrumbs and  parmesan coating which makes it too salty for me. Our wonderful waitress instantly said they will cook me another fish without the coating. Which it turned out better but it was still too salty. The dessert she recommended was great, pineapple upsidedown cake for two...which was a good ending for an enjoyable evening.",

From melt-in-your-mouth onion rolls to fish exquisitely prepared (three dishes: Scottish salmon, mahi-mahi, and mock abalone for a vegan diner) to scrumptious sides, a complimentary mini-cake for our petite birthday celebrant, and attentive waitstaff who graciously and professionally navigated my food sensitivities with the chef (bringing me baking soda and buttermilk to counteract culinary acids and heat). One of my favorite restaurants. Thank you, Lakeside, for another memorable outing. When meals are this good I keep the receipt and tuck it in our memory box. This one was a keeper.",

Everyone was friendly and the men were even asked to cut down the middle of their steaks to make sure their temps were correct. The cocktails were delicious and flowing and our view of the lake show was a perfect added bonus.  Not to mention they offer a vegan menu and the items ordered were incredible.    For the 3 Star part. When we initially made our resos over the phone, the Lakeside employee informed us there was a dress code...collar shirts and no open toe shoes.  We packed our dining clothes accordingly but called back 2 days later to confirm the open toe shoes for women and the 2nd Lakeside employee said the open toe shoes only applied to men, not women and added men could not wear shorts either. Men had to wear long pants and collar shirts. As we were dining, we all clearly witnessed other guests (men) dining in shorts and T-shirts. We kept noticing throughout our meal men not dressing to the \"dress code\" and still able to enjoy a meal. Clearly they were not turned away at the door and that upset the men with us bc where we were seated in the restaurant, the men were sweating. The a/c was being sucked right out the sliding doors and they were wearing jeans and slacks with collar shirts, occasionally wiping the sweat off their foreheads.  The food and ambiance was top notch but the \"dress code\" needs to be adjusted and fit for every guest, not just certain guests. At Lakeside prices, the dress code shouldn't be a priority, but treating every guest the same and offering delicious meals with impeccable service.",

It's difficult to rate Lakeside: the ambiance is 5-star, and the food was delicious, but the prices kill the place.  We had the cold seafood platter, and split the ribeye, an order of creamed spinach, and an order of lobster poutienne.  We also ordered two desserts to go.  I could go to King's Fish House in the District at Green Valley Ranch and get the same meal at half the price.  But this is the Wynn, so I should expect things to be a bit pricey.  Another thing that got us: you're right on the Lake of Dreams, and it's a spectacular view, but the sight of a giant animatronic frog singing, \"I've got Friends in Low Places\" every half an hour kind of kills the mood.  If you're at the Wynn, this is a go-to place.  If you're just out and about looking for a good seafood place, there are others.",

Let me tell you why.  The menu has a nice variety of fish and shellfish. They let you decide how you want it cooked and what if any sauce you want on it. They have a separate gluten free menu which made ordering for my wife very easy.  The fish we ordered was superb. Perfectly cooked with some very nice garlic mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables.  To add to the experience they baked some gluten free bread for my wife and served it right out of the oven. The chef also stopped by to personally check that her allergy concerns were addressed.  There was literally nothing to critique so I am giving them 5 stars. They will definitely be a must do for us next time we are visiting,",

Perfect for dinner with friends and family.  We ordered scallops in almond butter sauce, filet mignon and the snapper also in almond butter sauce.  We finished it with vanilla, salted carmel and coconut sorbet. The scallops and snapper were pretty good. The steaks were tender and flavorful. The sorbet was meh. The coconut flavor tasted artificial, not fresh coconut. For a dinner of 5, we paid $850, includes a bottle of wine ($200). For this kind of money,  the food should be flawless. It was good,  but could be better.  Despite this,  I'm giving a higher rating for the ambience.",

The crab legs had a weird taste, the lobster tail was OK, long story short the shrimp was the only edible thing on tower. We ordered the blue lobster as entree and if the lobster itself  was not known to be tender, it wouldn't excite your taste buds. The lobster macaroni and cheese--HORRIBLE. Do not recommend this place. If you want good seafood check out American Fish at Aria",

    "text": "Five stars for customer service alone! After a less than par customer service experience at another restaurant on the strip the night before, my husband and I decided to head the lake for a drink before seeing David Spade. When we got to the lake, we realized that the wait for the cocktail-only area was going to be pretty long, and since we were hungry for dinner, we decided to give it a shot and ask if they had any tables at the Lakeside.   We walked up to the hostess desk and timidly asked if there were any tables available outside. Now keep in mind, it was 8:30 PM on a Saturday night with the beautiful Wynn lake shows going every thirty minutes, so a patio table was gold. To our complete surprise, the host very nicely said yes! He said that we got very lucky and that they had a couple no shows, so he quickly showed us to an amazing table right on the lake and sat us within two minutes of a show starting. I was completely blown away by their level of customer service. But it doesn't stop there. We didn't have a ton of time (unfortunately because I could have sat there all night), since we were seeing a 10 PM show but when the waitress came up and took our order she was extremely receptive to our time crunch and put our order in right away. She was extremely friendly every step of the way. From there we enjoyed the beautiful weather and atmosphere and watched the spectacular shows on the lake that were going on every 30 minutes.   If you are anything like me and love atmosphere, you must (I repeat must) eat here. It's expensive but so is every other nice restaurant on the strip. Is it overpriced? Well of course! But they can do that in Vegas and don't think every other nice restaurant isn't doing the same thing! I will spend my money here because they treated us like royalty, accommodated us on a whim and listened to our needs in rushing our meal. This was one of my favorite parts of the trip because of how relaxing and beautiful the environment was. Oh and the food isn't bad either! In fact, it's quite delicious! I highly recommend the lobster mac and cheese with huge chunks of lobster and the crab cakes. Their Cesar salad is a hearty and flavorful salad to start with.   In summary, if you want a romantic evening with your honey, under the stars, watching a performance on the lake created by the same man behind the Bellagio and a delicious meal to accompany it, dine here. It's going to take a lot to convince me to leave the Wynn properties next time I come to town!",

I didn't like the weird mesquite sauce that they put on top of the steak, but the actual meat was tender and done medium rare as I ordered.  The bread platter variety was good too. Cocktails were delicious as well.  If you order any of the steaks, be sure to get the creamed spinach side!!! Might be the best compared to all the other steakhouses I've tried, Donovans, Peter Luger's, Ruth Chris, etc. Lobster mac n' cheese was just all right - will pass next time.  If you sit in the right area you can even watch the Wynn show. It's a little disturbing though with Disney like animations and voices. But not bad.",

For the entree we had Chilean Seabass schnitzel style and a pink snapper with a soy sauce glaze.  I expected the Seabass to be lightly breaded and pan fried.  Instead it had a heavy flavorless breading and was deep-fried.  Completely tasteless to be honest did not taste anything like Seabass.  The pink snapper was also a little disappointing but much better than the Seabass.  We finished off the meal with three tastings of the small desserts.  Brownie with ice cream. Cheesecake balls covered in pop rocks.   The desserts were very good.  Service was good nothing special but definitely adequate.",

I have to say that steak was cooked to perfection and the kick of spiciness was spot on. My wife had the scallops, and they too were cooked perfectly and a good portion size, unlike other places that sell scallop dishes. Our waitress was great, always checked in with us to see if we needed anything.  The only flaw is the weird show with the robotic singing frog. I could without that.",

We weren't super hungry, so we took a little time to order our food.  Afterward though, their service was a bit slow and they didn't come back to check on us often.  I ordered their lobster soup, which was really delicious and then I simply ordered a side of mushroom fried rice.  The waiter wasn't kidding when he said the sides should be shared, as they were large (enough for three people).  The rice was good, but on the salty side, so I wasn't able to finish it.  My boyfriend had the prime rib (even though one of my coworkers who was originally from Vegas insisted that we never, ever order prime rib  anywhere).  The rib was good and tender, but contained lots of tendon and fat.  My boyfriend liked it overall.  I think the view was the best part.  We stayed there for about an hour and a half, so we saw three different shows. They play a little show on the lake every 30 minutes where they project images and music onto the waterfall.  They had a singing frog and a little animation clip.  They animation clip was my favorite, we saw that part shortly before we took off.  The staff even surprised us with a mini cupcake for my birthday.  That made me feel very special.",

The view of the water while dining, almost makes you feel like you are in a totally different place, it is a very nice and relaxing contrast from the action of the casino and the strip. I would recommend the Chilled Shellfish Platter shared as an appetizer for all, and the Mesquite Smoked Prime Rib for the main entree with a side of their Grilled Asparagus, just fantastic!!!!!!!",

From 2005-2012 the space contained the Daniel Boulud Brasserie.   The space itself is truly unique. Inside the color palette is primarily orange and is spacious yet intimate. Most tables offer good views of the Lake of Dreams performance that takes place every thirty minutes on the lake that the restaurant's primary views overlook.   The food is pricey but very good. There is a vast wine selection. This is an outstanding and very unique restaurant and location to host clients. If you have an interest in the performance, there is no better seat than outside next to the lake. Seating there is \"first come\" but worth the wait if there is one.",

We each had a dozen and corked a bottle of Champagne. The corkage fee is $50, so beware. And if they have your particular bottle in stock, you will not be able to cork it! I got lucky- Vintage 2004 Don Perignon was not in stock- hehe.   We loved the experience here and the beautiful view of the Lake waterfall. The complementary bread basket they provide is to die for! Our server was extremely attentive and kind- I wish I knew her name. She was great!",

    "text": "Enojoyed a fantastic dinner with colleagues at this beautiful restaurant. We were seated facing the massive fountain and really enjoyed the Vegas style entertainment during dinner!  For the appitizer, I had grilled spanish octopus served over diced potatoes.  The octopus was very tender, though the sear was a bit harsh and left somewhat of a \"char\" flavor that was more than I would have liked.  Overall though, an enjoyable appitizer.  For the main course, I had the Chef's selection of rack of lamb served with spiced onions and lovely mint sauce - served rare.   The flavor was lovely; well seasoned and nicely balanced with the accompaniments.  The meat was tender, nicely seared on the outside and soft and juicy in the center.  Very nicely done.  For sides, we had the creamed spinich, sauteed baby bok choy,  asparagus and lobster poutine - crispy potato, lobster, and melted mozzerella.  The sides were were all delicious.  I finished the meal with a small scoop of manderine and thyme sherbet.  Very refreshing and a nice palet cleanser.  Service was on point, just as you would expect for this style of dinning.  We had a large party of about 20 and they handled it very well without delay or confusion.  Each diner received the requisite attention one would expeect.  Overall, well done.  The only thing that kept me from 5 stars was I found the food overall very well done, but I did not come away completely amazed as I have with other restauarants of this caliber.  Still, I would highly recommend.m",

    "text": "Dined here on a Sunday night with another couple and requested to sit outside. The restaurant is very beautiful and so is the scenery (waterfall)   Since we had a big lunch, we decided to order an appetizers and entree to share. For the four of us.   We ordered the following:  1/2 dozen oysters Crab cake-1 piece LOL Yellowtail Carpaccio 1 Steak  2-glasses of wine And a BIG FAT CHECK $500+  Um....this may sound like a lot of food but not if you saw the portions. TINY!!! Crab cake did not go around since it wasn't even enough for 1 person rather than 4 people. We asked for the steak to be medium and it came out EXTRA CRISPY with a side of charcoal flavor. We sent it back and it took another 25 minutes for a new one to come out.   During dinner, the lake that has the waterfall would put on small shows with random artistic pictures, dancing with balls, etc.. you have to see it to know what I'm talking about. BUT it was  kind of weird, awkward and scary.   Prob never go back here when there is Mastros and so many other places",

Located in the Wynn which I think is the most tastefully decorated casino in Vegas, if there is such a thing.  Made a reservation on open table about an hour before arrival.  We were quickly seated with an inside table looking out over the pool and waterfall.  Perfect seats for being inside.  Our meal was great.  I had salmon that was done very well and my guest were equally happy with their fish dishes.  The service was great and the wine list was adequate not fantastic.  Overall a great place on the strip.  A little less hectic then the rest of the strip.",

We had an appetizer of king crab with avocado that we split between us, and it was excellent. I ordered the filet mignon and my husband had the ribeye. Both were excellent. The only disappointment was the desserts. My husband ordered the vegan carrot cake, which was truly awful. He thought it tasted like some frozen Sara Lee cake from the freezer section at your grocery store. It was my birthday, so I was given a free birthday eclair. That also was not good, but it was actually better than they the vegan carrot cake. In other words, go for the ambience and the main food. Skip the desserts.",

Especially at those prices!!   Service is what you're really paying for. We had three guys on us. Pulling out my chair, putting the napkin on your lap. Making sure everything was right. Everyone was super friendly.  Looking at the menu, we recognized everything. So it wasn't THAT fancy! Husband and I knew what we wanted and our waiter gave us some great recommends for our sides. All in all, the standout dishes were the appetizers. I really loved the Tuna Tartar and Clam Chowder. The New Zealand Sea Bass had a lot of flavors. Sweet, salty, peppery I didn't know if I liked it. The actual fish was amazing tho! Soft and juicy.  We had to see how the desserts were. We ordered the truffles and Root Beer Float. I love root beer float and to have it infused with Root Beer Flavored Vodka? WIN!!! The truffles were fun. The champagne truffle took us by surprise... they we were crackling in our mouth! Like Pop Rocks!! Turns out they do put Pop Rocks on that one. That was fun :)  All in all had a great time. I enjoyed that everything came out slowly and we were able to enjoy our meal, talking and watching the show. Great date spot! It was a really entertaining show and I felt service was top notch. Would I come back? Sorry, no!",

First I have to say it was not my first choice but SW steakhouse which is my favorite and I ate there a lot of times and I has to get our dinner at the Wynn and that place was mostly empty, took more then 30 minutes for our drinks to come and the appetizers 10 minutes later and tables that had another servers sat 20 minutes after us got their much casters. I should have ordered the steak because I've been told was the same as SW's but my friend told me since it's a fish restaurant I should go with seafood and I got the lobster risotto which was under cooked and without flavor my wife got the fish the waiter recommended and so did my friend try another fish he never came back to check and it was flavorless! It was very hard to get the our attention  of the waiter and none of the porters or the managers came to check on our food which most of us didn't like and in the end when was time to pay the waiter was there right away very nice and ready to get his tip! I would never go to eat there again and the only reason I put two stars is because the location which is Beautiful.",

It was horrible and I took a few bites and passed it to my date who said it was fine. To  me, it tasted like it had undercooked flour in it with poor flavor. Next, I had the chili rubbed ribeye and crab. The strip of crab was steamed perfectly and I loved it. I ate 1/4 of my steak and could not finish. The chili rub was horrible. There was mild heat (from the chili, which was nice) but the seasoning was bland and lifeless. However, it was a great cut of meat and was cooked to perfection (medium rare). I took it home and will season it and enjoy it for breakfast. The Yukon whipped potatoes with lobster were disappointing and tasted like they were made with water instead of cream or milk (this may be wrong because I did not ask but the taste lacked the richness that milk or cream provide). The mushrooms were amazing and perfect. The chicken (sampled from my date's plate) was very good. A spinach porcini cannelloni accompanied it, which was horrible. Again, it tasted like it had undercooked flour in it and lacked any real flavor. My date did not eat it, which shocked me because he eats everything! In two years of dating, this was a first.   I love the view and the ambiance was great even from the booth at the back of the restaurant. The service was slower than we would like but still within an acceptable period. If I did not dine out as much as I do, I might not have found this to be an issue but for a high-end restaurant, they need to step up the service.",

    "text": "I have nothing but great things to say about Lakeside.  I recently proposed to my girlfriend there and they went above and beyond to make our evening special.    I called two weeks ahead and made reservations requesting outside seating by the lake for our proposal dinner.  The receptionist was very friendly and made annotations in the reservation reference out special night.    A day prior to our dinner I arrived at the Wynn and spoke with Lakeside manager Elian.  He was extremely helpful and suggested a few creative ways to execute the proposal.  I had a special jewelry box crafted for her ring and did not want to risk her seeing me bring it to the restaurant the day of, so he held it at the restaurant for me.  He assured us prime seating by the lake the next day and guaranteed a magical evening.  The next evening we both arrived in anticipation of a spectacular dinner, and a little surprise for her.  We arrived 30 minutes early and were immediately seated next to the lake.  I excused myself for a moment and met with Elian to give him the ring.  He assured me the staff was informed and would do everything they could to make our evening special.  I went back to the table and we were both treated to a spectacular dining experience.    They start by bringing by a large tank of lobsters directly to the table.  A description of each is giving with a price attached.  My girlfriend (fiance now), thought they were too adorable to eat....lol.  Our waiter, Renee, was personable and very knowledgeable about every item on the menu.  We ended up sharing a bowl of delicious king crab corn chowder and prawn cocktail to start.  The chowder is seriously some of the best we have had.  For entrees, she had the chili rubbed prime rib with king crab, and I went with the 20oz prime rib with a roasted lobster tail add-on.  Everything was excellent and cooked to perfection.  After finishing our entrees, a small tray was brought out with my custom made jewelry box on it, flanked by two complimentary deserts.  She took one look at it and was speechless.  I removed the ring from the box and took a knee to propose to her.  After she said yes, complimentary champagne was poured and staff and patrons gave their congratulations.  We stayed and had more drinks, enjoying the fun and quirky shows they have every 30min right on the lake.  We never felt rushed and Renee continued to stop by to make sure we had everything we needed.  On our way out, I stopped by and made sure to let Elian know how much we enjoyed dinner and the extra special attention given to make our evening special.  He thanked us for choosing the Lakeside and hoped we would return.    After the excellent service we received, I assured him we would definitely return to their wonderful establishment.  My fiance suggested we return every year now for an anniversary dinner.  I don't have any problems with that.",

    "text": "My review is for the Sunday jazz brunch. This used to happen at the Wynn country club. It was fantastic and I mean was.  The last time we came Lakeside was for Mother's Day brunch. It was good. The dessert bar wasn't all that great and the seafood bar was just OK. Otherwise it was good and I gave it four stars. When I heard that the jazz brunch that used to take place at the Wynn country club would now be taking place at Lakeside, we decided to give it a try.  I loved the jazz brunch at the country club. There was a long beautiful display buffet with fresh seafood of different varieties, an area of charcuterie and fresh bread, an area of southern choices including incredible shrimp and grits, and an area of bagels and cream cheese and lox, you could order off the menu with a lovely array of choices, and the dessert area was unreal: a vitrine incredible cakes almost like being at Payard or Jean Philippe bakeries, and the atmosphere was relaxing and calming with lovely jazz playing in the background. This was all inclusive with a price of about $68 per person and was well worth it! The current brunch is not the jazz brunch that I knew! We were grossly disappointed. Quite frankly, it is now officially a rip off. There was a seafood area and it is limited but you will like it if you're into crab legs and shrimp. They bring a basket of a few breads/pastries to your table, a fruit platter, and someone comes around with a few choices of a ham and cheese grilled sandwich or a small avocado toast, both which were just OK. The bread/bakery basket was disappointing and we would have not picked up over half of what they gave us so it was a big no-no for us. The fruit platter was good. The choices up the menu that we ordered included a buckwheat and chicken crepe, a mushroom and cheddar omelette, steak frites, Lemon ricotta pancakes, and a yogurt with granola and berries. They were all just OK and that was really disappointing because nothing made me say wow or made me want to order another either now or in the future. The coffee was OK and not as good as I remember it. The price is $68 per person and this does not include alcohol. The price is exorbitant and simply no longer worth it. So I would have given it three stars despite this, but here is why I chose to give it one star: we had reservations and we were put at a table that was pathetic. We had no view of the waterfall and it was poorly positioned. Being someone who comes to The Wynn a lot, including having been to Lakeside, I know the level of customer service expected and we were placed at a table with no view and other tables that were available with views were still empty. That was extremely disappointing. I did not feel that I needed to say anything as they should have known to sit us at a better table. Our waiter was, and I am not exaggerating, one of the three worst waiters I have ever had. He never came to take our order and we had to keep making eye contact with him to give him any clues. He was barely around and just provided the worst customer service possible. I will not be coming here and this place is getting one star because, for how expensive it is, I expect top-notch customer service, top-notch food, and a top notch environment. This time, it's failed in all three areas. Will not be going back.",

We loved the live jazz music and the set up. It was a little different, you could order unlimited from a small menu and the kitchen would prepare it. Afterwards, you could get your helping from the actual buffet set up. In addition to that, they set your table with complimentary fruit platters, a large pastry assortment, and servers would walk around and offer small hors d'oeuvres. In the end it was quite a lot of food and definitely worth the money!",

As a vegan you would not notice much that they have a regular menu that caters to everyone else unless you actually paid attention. You are served with your own basket of vegan sourdough rolls with vegan butter to start, I ordered the vegan crab cakes it really didn't taste much like  crab cakes but it was very tasty. But the beef wellington was out of this world!!!!! For dessert I choose the carrot cake (bad choice for me) Great taste but very rich, and a little too dense. The wait staff was just great (the best that I've ever seen) I would give this place ten stars if I could. This will surely be one of my new places to dine, I'll be back very soon after making my rounds in the rest of Wynn's and Encore's fine dining establishments.",

We were able to watch the light and waterfalls show. The staff was very attentive to us all since it was a dinner celebration. However the food isn't the best. The scallop entree and the King Crab Avocado salad were a bit salty. The rest are ok but the desserts are the best. They have a big desserts intended for big occasions. And the bread is quite alright.   If you want to watch the show by the Falls then Lakeside Restaurant is the right place. Quite romantic if you don't mind the food. Drinks are always good though .",

I want to start by saying our waiter was beyond excellent. He has worked at Lakeside for four years and you could tell he was very familiar with the menu and each individual item. He was also well versed on the various wines available.   The food was fine to very good depending on the item. The shellfish was excellent, the fish good, but nothing special. The meats were cooked beautifully but bland. The biggest problem with Lakeside were the prices. Everything was about 20% more expensive than it should have been.   A minuscule portion of caviar was $13, but contained so little actual caviar, that you couldn't taste it. I ordered a blue lobster special and while it was as delicious as the waiter promised, it cost over $250.   The Wynn is considered a luxury destination and I'm not against spending a good deal for a special occasion, but the food has to merit the price point. It didn't quite do that at Lakeside.   Lastly, the lakeside shows were bizarre and while they were running, the patio became overly crowded. The glowing balls that ultimately mate and give birth to a baby ball was particularly odd.",

Only complain I might have is that the selections are pretty small.  Just a few items in the seafood boat at the center of the restaurant.  There also are about 8 items hat you can order from the brunch menu.  Dessert selections are pretty good.  Compare to other Sunday brunch such as a Sterling., selections at Lakeside are about 10th that of Sterling.  However, quality of food at Lakeside  are so much better.  It's like comparing Four Seasons with Motel 6.  I believe the people that's complaining about Lakeside's price and others are so used to eating at everyday buffet place that's got tons of selection for cheaper prices that they can't tell the difference between those and this high end Sunday only brunch location.  I prefer quality over quantity, so, I will choose Lakeside over others every time.   Only other, their champagne price at $65 is a bit high compare to the price of brunch.",

    "text": "Normally I wouldn't be coming to a $$$$ restaurant but since I was invited, why the heck not. Upon coming in, we were warmly greeted by our host who took us to our table right away. They even offered us a Shaw for one of our co-workers that only had a dress on and she was cold. Talk about service :)  The ambience was good, imagine gold river rocks covering all over the walls as decorations. They tried really hard being more ocean friendly but I don't think that worked to their advantage but I'm different, I like the all natural look.  Appetizers: We had the octopus as an appetizer along with lobster bisque and the crab cakes. The appetizers range between $16 to $25 for a little bite size but that's kind of expected for this high end restaurant. I would recommend the lobster bisque and the octopus but skip the crab cake since I didn't find that very good..too fishy for my taste   Entrees: it was okay for the price point. For the fish, they are all freshly caught within a day or two and ranges between$50 to$60 a plate. Notice that this does not include any sides which range between $16 to $27 per side dish (mac and cheese, asparagus, mushrooms, mashed potatoes, and broccoli).   I personally had the pomfret fish which was a great delight. Very smooth and unlike any fish I've had prior. My only caveat was that the broth it came in was way too salty. Otherwise I highly recommend.  The blue lobsters were $39 per pound and each lobster weighed 2. 5 lb.  If you want lobsters, you are looking at dropping $100 per dish. Granite, you do get a LOT of lobsters with 3 different sauces.   Drinks: we order a bottle of theirnNew Zealand Sauvignon Blanc and a bottle of their red blends, once again, you're looking at dropping roughly a $100 to $150 per bottle and a few of us had their cocktail. Nothing special but rouhky $16 to $20 per drink.   When all the food and drinks, we were too stuffed to try the desert so no comments on that.  Overall, I would recommend this restaurant if you're in the mood for dropping quite a bit of money on a meal. if that is the case, make sure you get outside seating since you get a much nicer view of the colorful waterfall in the dark.",

Way to seem all prestigious before we dine and then find out no one even really eats here.. And now I know why! The food is way overpriced and mediocre. For a restaurant only 20% occupied food took forever to come out too. Clam chowder was ok. Scallops were ok. Steak was cold. Tuna carpaccio was salty. For 20 bucks, the single crab cake was tiny and bland. Only thing I really enjoyed was the lobster mac n cheese but who can mess that up??? Especially at a \"$$$$\" restaurant.

They offer gluten free bread to start if needed (not good, but nice they have available.) The carrot side is OK...big chunks of carrots dripping in butter. Asparagus was ok, nothing special.  The lobster potato side is decadent, rich, cheesy and memorable.   Great spot to dine.",

I called ahead to reserve a table outside for 5 (my parents & 2 sisters). Last time I was here with my fiance we were seated outside and loved the view of the beautiful water and little shows that go on.  We ordered a nice bottle of white wine and my father had beer. We ordered: MANHATTAN SEAFOOD CHOWDER (Medley of Seafood, Smoked Sausage) $16 FRIED CALAMARI Ancho Chile Aioli, Chimichurri, Lemon $18 CHOPPED VEGETABLE SALAD Cherry Tomatoes, Garbanzo Beans, Bacon, Blue Cheese, Avocado, Zinfandel Vinaigrette $16 (note: I ordered the vegan version of this ---they have a full vegas menu, it was $2 less and had no bacon or blue cheese) ATLANTIC SEA SCALLOPS Celery Root Puree, Apple Chutney, Vadouvan Sauce $38 ROASTED JUMBO SHRIMP Confit Peppers, Capers, Melted Tomatoes $35  SAUTEED MUSHROOMS $11 LOBSTER RISOTTO Bahamian Lobster Tail, Leeks and Fine Herbs $52  So since I am a vegetarian, the comments are from my family regarding the seafood. The calamari was excellent. Risotto dish was quite dry, my mother regrets not telling them at the time. Scallops and jumbo shrimp was really tasty. Overall, if you're a seafood fan this is the place to go for a gorgeous view and tasty seafood. They even came by with the poor little lobsters on a tray to show which ones they can kill for you. LOL I felt so bad! Great service too!",

While it was cooked to the proper texture, the flavor was simply inedible. They may have prepared it by poaching in salted butter with extra salt, although this was not a butter - poached lobster dish. Those are divine. This was gross. Noone came over to inquire, I did not order a replacement (only dessert), and they charged us for the entire entree. I had taken 3 bites. If I had known, I would have boxed it up for a homeless person instead. My boyfriend withheld this information until today, which was smart, because I would have demanded a meeting with the manager. Quite overrated and inappropriate, in my opinion. Service, other than that egregious mistake, was friendly and prompt.  The view was beautiful, but I would not like to return for dinner at any time.",

It was obvious you were paying for a mediocre view of the waterfall show at the Wynn.  Awestruck that they charged for the refills of the smallest glass of coke, filled to the brim with ice, $4 a pop.  I ordered a pepperoni pizza, the menu said it also came with mushrooms and red peppers, I saw none of the last two.  I had to ask the waiter for crushed pepper flakes too.  The pizza was super thin, about as thin as you can get, and oval shaped.  The crust wasn't crisp, something you'd expect for something so thin.  Instead, it was soggy.  It seems the higher price you pay, the less food you get.  Don't think I'll be coming back to this overpriced dump again.",

We decided to check it out and it turned out to be the find of this stay at the Wynn. The special is $1.50 oysters in the bar. They were amazing. We loved them so much that our first night we ordered two orders of a dozen (two of each of the six varieties they had that evening). When they arrived, the waitress explained which were which (I always find this helpful) and left us to just be wowed. The oysters also arrive with a nice garnish tray if you like saucing yours up. An Asian sauce, vinegar and onion, and a cocktail sauce. Lots of lemon and horse radish accompanied.   We enjoyed our oysters on the nights we visited with very nice dirty martini's. They came with traditional pimento olives or blue cheese stuffed (these were always being made and never available when we asked for them)  Swing by Lakeside. If this special is offered, take them up on it. It will be well worth your visit.   We will try the restaurant next time.",

My theory: People are in Vegas to party and have a good time. They often eat at these places while they're having a great time regardless of the quality of the food or restaurant. When they go to write a yelp review, they assume that the high price tag and the fun evening must mean that the restaurant was great.   Lakeside is the epitome of this phenomenon. Bland overpriced fish is masked by the conveniently distracting singing frog light show in the lake overlooked by the patio. Sure, it is a fun experience and everyone is having a good time. But the bottom line: the food isn't good.  I had the mahi mahi, prepared with citrus and olive oil, and it was just bland. I know, I know, I picked the most bland preparation. But the fish itself was nothing special. The favorite part of my meal was the pretzel breadsticks.",

The menus are covered in this weird orange rubbery material that reminded me of Howard Johnson's. We ordered apps and mains and a glass of wine each. It's not like we were being cheap, but he kept up selling and it was annoying.  The pretzel roll was the best thing I had. I ordered Ceaser salad because I needed a little crunch. It was pretty soggy. Over dressed. The scallops themselves were delicious, but whatever the puree was was tasteless (and it looked like someones thumb had gotten stuck in it on the way out) and the sauce looked like it had just been thrown on the plate.  Disappointing. The husbands crab/avocado was tasty, if not a major throwback, but his fish was just heavy w butter and under seasoned.   On top of everything, I felt like we were really being pushed through. I just never felt like I could relax and enjoy my not inexpensive meal. The only time I felt like we were wanted was when we didn't buy into the upsell for coffee and dessert.   The bathroom was cool, though.",

The \"Lakeside\" is a funny man made lake where they do a water show starting around 8:30 (think singing frogs, dancing globes, cowboy hats- a real eclectic variety show). We sat outside to see the show, and can't deny that it was weirdly entertaining. Everything in Vegas is expensive, especially when you stay within the hotels, but this place was crazy expensive for a pretty OK meal (expensive = $500+ for 3 people, drinks, apps, and sides- no entrees or desserts!).. The sommelier was not so helpful, and was borderline rude. I guess that's what happens when you ask for a good value wine and the best options he can give are upwards of $200.  We ordered apps to start (4 for the 3 of us) and were not so much feeling full entrees after the first round. We went with the King Crab guacamole, the tuna sashimi, the octopus and a salad. Everything good, not great, with the salad probably out-shining the seafood which should not be the case at a seafood restaurant! We ended up ordering a few sides as our second course and we were plenty full. Of the sides, the lobster Mac was pretty good, along with the creamed spinach. We may have gone out raving about the entrees if we ordered them, but based on what we ordered I would say average seafood meal, nothing spectacular, and probably wouldn't go back.",

I ordered the scallops from Hokkaido and my hubby order fish fresh from Hawaii.  Both entrees were delicious.  In fact, I must say that my grilled scallops were the best scallops i had thus far.

    "text": "I would like to give my experience with this restaurant. Lastnight myself & my boyfriend had reservations, we requested outside which we had to wait approximately 40 mins at the bar, where one of the bartenders asked us to sit at the table if we wanted faster service, mind you he he was cleaning his station & he wasn't waiting on anyone. Nop we like to sit at the bar & we can wait. As others came to the bar he told them the same. I think he was in a hurry to get off. Later another bartender asked if we would care for snacks which was very nice of him bc we were very hungry. Finally we get seated & i was very pleased with the ambiance, the water show was very unique. By the time our server came over she tells us we have to hurry up with our order as the kitchen will be closing soon. I guess it was late 10ish but we were waiting for our table for so long at the bar. They still had several people eating. I was very pleased we sat outside it was a beautiful evening & the water show was quite fascinating & intriguing. We ordered the filet mignon steak  & chicken with a side of broccoli. Boy was i disappointed!! The steak was seared to a crisp on the top layer which gave the entire steak a burnt flavor, my chicken was so dry i couldn't & wouldn't eat it all. I really wanted to enjoy our meals but this was not the case. I told our sever who had their manager come over. We will never come back to this restaurant. After the complaint the manger said he would relate our message to the chef. Did nothing to accommodate us & with these prices this is not what we expected. Again very disappointed",

I had the potato leek soup which had a nice presentation but I fully believe the potatoes were of the frozen bagged nature (thumbs down). At the urging of our painfully slow waiter my group of 5 ordered the family style surf and turf. We choose the Maine lobster, tomahawk steak, king crab mac n' cheese and black truffle creamed spinach as sides.  Lobster - decent. Didn't try any of the 3 butters since I prefer only lemon on my lobster.  Steak - fine to decent. Since most of my party preferred their steak midrare most of the meat was undercooked for my liking.  The cipollini onions were delightful.  Mac n cheese - did not like the seasoning Creamed spinach - meh, again the seasoning Iced tea - tasted like the smell of a fresh opened bandaid, totally weird. I would be hard pressed to choose this restaurant again in a city packed with amazing dining options.",

They bring the seafood by on ice so you can see what you're going to eat and the cuts of meat are very similar to those offered at sister steakhouse SW Steakhouse. The lobster options are all decadent and you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The variety of butters that they bring along with the lobster are amazing. Make sure to order fries as well to round out the meal.   There is an incredible view of the Lake of Dreams, which has shows incrementally that light up the waterfall as well as the lake. 10/10 would recommend for a date.",

Doesn't mean its the fanciest for you people who dine like this regularly :) So the two dishes we ordered was lobster and steak.  The steak (i dont remember which cut) was cooked to perfection when we asked for medium. As a side we had mashed potatoes. They were the creamiest mashed potatoes ive ever tasted. So good. The Lobster was cooked perfect as well. It came with a couple butters if i remember correctly.   The bill: two dinners and two alcoholic drinks came out to $200. :x Kinda a lot but it was a special occasion.   We requested over the phone to be sat outside in the patio by the water but after several attempts we got denied saying it was booked for the night.   After dinner we decided to quickly try our luck on the nearest slot machine just for fun.  Ended up winning over $450. Lol.  So that paid for our $200 dinner. (So dinner was free and on the wynn hotel) and its like they also paid us $250 cash as a thank you. :) So needless to say.... it was a great free night plus they paid us.",

Small but large, gorgeous but unpretentious, that carousel of flowers when you walk thru the gorgeous lobby and gardens, it is heavenly.   Lakeside is the designer bag completing the already perfect outfit. You enter the hotel by a curved escalator and pictured outside is an incredible waterfall.   The interior decor of the restaurant is lovely. Bright and cheerful and clean and ornate. We were greeted by a handsome host who found us the perfect table.   After we were seated, we were immediately greeted by our server. I cannot remember his name but he was fantastic! I loved that he cared enough to immediately introduce himself, and said he would be back in a few minutes. He was so personable and knowledgeable.   We dined on the shrimp cocktail, and decided to split the filet and lobster risotto. All three were perfection. But the best part? The chimichurri sauce he brought us for the filet. Oh my word: divine! Dessert looked amazing, but honestly we were too full to even attempt. I would have gone with the Sugarloaf cake. Don't miss this place and definitely don't miss LaReve. It was incredible. I will definitely be staying at the Wynn on my next Vegas trip!   Well done!",

I had a meal with 6 colleagues, 2 of whom are vegan and one vegetarian.   Lakeside was the first restaurant in forever that had real vegetarian offerings.  They had vegan old bay crab cakes (omg frickin amazing), gardein chix pot pie, meatloaf, and a quinoa dish as well as some great appetizers, salads and even some vegan desserts.    It was the first restaurant in a long time (Vegas or elsewhere) where I didn't feel like an afterthought.  Large wine list.   My colleagues who ate the fish were all thrilled too, we had an extremely knowledgeable waiter who enthused about the recommendations.  I cannot wait to return.   Oh and the Wynn is beautiful and much more upscale than the huge old places.  It was decorated beautifully for Christmas.",

Well, the happy hour specials are gone, but the oysters are still around and fresh and tasty as ever. We've always eaten at the bar, so I can't comment on table service,  but the bar staff is always friendly and fun.  No attitude.  They always have honest menu suggestions.  Some food highlights:  Spanish Octopus with white bean salad Hudson Valley Foie Gras with bread pudding.  It's ridiculously decadent.  And amazing.   Any of the fresh Hawaiian fish offerings and choice of preparation and tasty sauces.  And of course, oysters! Beautifully decorated space- just enough Vegas glam.  If you're at a table or on the patio there's the Lake of dreams show (think waterfall, lights, giant singing head, singing frog, dancing balls...) that happens throughout the night for some bizarre entertainment.  Don't worry, it's not intrusive.  Just a bit of fun Vegas ridiculousness.  Go! Enjoy!",

Then when the table was ready came up to us and address us by name to leads us to our table.  That nice touch instead of calling out a name to a room of people.  The table service started out good.  They rolled our the lobster cart and we ordered immediately.  Great energy and sense of humor.    Then we get turned over to our waiter and table staff.  All down hill from here.  Once the food arrived, there was no check back to see if everything was good.  To get drink refills we had to rudely call out at wait staff as they dashed by - at times more than once just for drink refills.    Price point - Vegas reasonable.  With menus online, if you are surprised by a bill you just didn't plan ahead.  But the service concerns WILL prevent me from bringing guests back here in future trips.  Botero is safer option at Wynn.",

    "text": "We came here for my Bday dinner on Sat night. The drinks were incredible, my bf had the vodka martini and I had champagne. We had crab cakes (which were mind blowing) and oysters for appetizers. The oysters were delicious. The bread basket was fun because they had lots of different types of breads, one for every taste bud.   I had the lobster risotto, very delicious but very filling. My bf had a different pasta dish. The waterfall show was romantic and entertaining. It was fun to watch and funny at times. It totally added to the overall ambiance of the dinner. View was amazing. We had a great time. Food was a little overpriced for what it was and compared to LA prices, but when in Rome...   At the end of the dinner they brought out a tiny cupcake with a candle for my bday with a little wafer that said Happy Bday. It was pretty much the best Bday ever. Great Dinner.",

    "text": "My husband and I had dinner here with 2 other couples a few weeks ago.  I was very excited because the menu looked fabulous and I've never had less than a fabulous meal at the Wynn or Encore.  We were very excited about the fresh Hawaiian fish they boast about.  Three of us had the Opakapaka (pink snapper) and although the fish was fine, the preparation was completely lacking in flavor, unimaginative, bland and boring.  Two of us had the scallops with the same preparation and we all felt the same way about our meal.  The only satisfied person in our party had a filet.  Considering Lakeside is a seafood restaurant, the fish should knock your socks off.  The desert trio which includes cotton candy was very good though.  The view from the outdoor patio with the light show made a nice background but since we had just seen LeReve, (fantastic!!), this light show was about as disappointing as the food!  I think it's tired and needs updating.  So I give the food a one star, the environment 3 stars and the service 2 stars.  Our waiter didn't have much personality and when he overhead one of us state that this was the worst dinner she's ever had, he came over to our table as if in shock but did not offer us anything to make us happy, nor did he apologize.  He could of at least given us the $21 dessert free!  We will NEVER go back there as we wasted over $600 on that meal.  There are so many fantastic restaurants in Vegas, many of which we've eaten at before.  It wasn't about the money, we don't mind paying for a sublime meal and that is why that meal was so disappointing, not to mention I took 2 other couples who ended up paying for my bad recommendation.  Save your money.  Go elsewhere!!!",

    "text": "Lakeside did not disappoint!  I made a reservation for after le reve and when we arrived I requested a table outside by the lake.  We waited in the bar for 10 min and were then given an excellent table.  Rene was our server and he was honestly the best waiter I've had in YEARS.  He was so pleasant to talk with and made EXCELLENT recommendations when asked.  We had the chef's special (halibut) and the seared yellow-fin.  The quality of the fish was impeccable and it was so very well prepared.  Again, I can't complement Rene enough for the quality of service.  He was always there when we needed something but never a bother.  The lake shows were a bit strange but offered some amusing entertainment.  The lake itself is gorgeous.  I'll definitely be back next time I'm in vegas.",

    "text": "What a wonderful surprise we stumbled upon. We stopped on a whim before the Garth Brooks show, not realizing what an awesome place this is. We were seated on the patio overlooking the lake and the wall of water. Immediately a team of servers went to work lighting our candle, removing extra place settings and assisting my wife with her napkin. We literally had five different people offering us outstanding service during the course of our meal.   For example, we order the meatballs and when they arrived, they were brought out by a manager who introduced himself, told us a bit about the meatballs, dished them onto our plates and then waited for our approval before excusing himself. We were treated to such remarkable service the entire evening.   Obviously we knew nothing about this place beforehand as we didn't even know about the impressive interactive shows that take place on the lake every half hour. The musical light shows were quite cool and left us entertained and impressed by the technological feats.   Great drinks. Wonderful meal. Outstanding service. Awesome atmosphere. A bit pricey, which is why I docked it a star, but of course the prices are on par for the Wynn.",

This restaurant will have one of the most unique layouts in Las Vegas with huge windows and outdoor seating next to the sight and sound of a large waterfall. It really makes the experience. Very bright and classy interior and, of course, excellent service. The food was excellent. I really have no complaints. It just wasn't memorable. The reason I know this is that one week after the meal, I can't remember what we ate. To me, a 5 star restaurant has to memorable on the food. But still if you are visiting Vegas this is a must go.",

    "text": "Really enjoyed dinner last night at Lakeside Grill. David was our waiter and took charge once he knew I am vegan and my wife is not.  It was nice to dine at a restaurant where a vegan and a carnivore can co-exist. The service was paced perfectly and our wine that we brought with us and dropped off a couple of hours prior to dinner for the sommelier to decant was perfect temperature. I had a vegan clam chowder with a cashew cream base followed by vegan old bay crab cakes. I even had vegan carrot cake that was wonderful. I recommend you give Lakeside Grill a try, particularly if you have a group with a mix of people with varying dietary preferences. Try and sit on the patio if weather permits so you can watch the show. The corkage is $50 per bottle, which seems reasonable, especially if you're asking them to chill and decant your wine ahead of your reservation.",

Price: the main sticking point,,, I know it's the Wynn but couldn't help but feel it was a little overpriced for the offerings and fairly unoriginal menu and the drinks really double up the price QUICKLY.  Service: The service has always been excellent here,, but sometimes the bussing by committee and expediters get confused.  Ambiance: Excellent ambiance, great view of the lake, extremely clean, wide open.  Some people think the music is loud, but I found it to be a non-event.  Cool bonus to see the show as well!  Food: The food varied in quality but I would err to 4/5 stars on the food.  Some of the fish seemed overseasoned imo.  A little buttery in some instances as well.  Very nice though overall.",

    "text": "I was looking forward to a good steak dinner. Unfortunately I chose this restaurant.    The ambiance was very bright and loud with Chris Isaac music playing loud enough to make talking difficult. At the tables around us people were constantly on their cell phones. There was a \"show\" put on every 30 minutes that consisted of two beach balls falling in love and having a child beach ball. And then there was a music video of a woman riding a snake. This was very different then the last restaurant that was here, Daniel Bouloud, that was a great place.   The food was not worth the $300 price for two people. I started with a Mac and Cheese appetizer with crab and asparagus. This was the best of the dinner. I then had the \"rib chop\" which was a ribeye steak. I ordered it medium it started out ok but about an inch into it it got rarer and rarer. And it was tough. The wine list was impressive but expensive. We had a $72 bottle of Chilean wine which was the cheapest on the list and fortunately very good.   Service was ok but no one came to our table to ask how we were enjoying the meal. Maybe they already knew the answer. Our waiter didn't know anything about the wine list but he called over the   sommelier who was able to answer my question.   All in all go somewhere else. This is way to expensive for this kind of experience. I wonder if Mr Wynn has eaten here.",

We both were beginning to be concerned that it might become a bit loud once this party was seated, however before the party arrived and without us saying a word, Emma came over and said there was a table that had opened up away from the party and asked if we'd like to move.  This was service above and beyond; proactive rather than reactive.",

We had the seafood platter, bake-lobster, swordfish and the best grilled octopus appetizer we ever had!! Seriously, tasty. It accompanied with side grilled mushrooms, a mist of sourness which make this dish perfect. There was a delayed (over 30 minutes) in serving food between our appetizer to the entrees. But the manager came to our table, personally extended her apologies for the delayed in the kitchen due to a large group in the back of the restaurant. She offers us the desert as a complimentary. Delicious ice cream & lemon cake. It was a kind gesture but it took another 20 minutes before the desert was served. It was 11:30pm. We were exhausted and didn't really enjoy the desert in fullest. But we will definitely come back and try the desert again. Highly recommended this place.",

It's nice, because it is generally not as crowded and loud as the SW, but has the same quality food. They require a business casual dress code, (no shorts, no open toe shoes for men). I ordered the bone-in filet steak, a Cesar salad, and the lobster Mac and cheese. The food is very high quality, the service was awesome also! The atmosphere is the best part, we sat on the balcony in the shade, and watched the water show over the peaceful sound of the waterfall. Highly recommended!",

Unfortunately,  our waiter wasn't the most pleasant person.  From start to end, his unprofessional behaviour only declined over time.  As a person who despises unprofessional behaviour in any setting, this takes one point off.  I'm being generous since I loved my stay at Encore and always feel at home in the Wynn properties.  We ordered... Crab cake Lobster bisque soup Tuna sashimi  King crab avocado   I can't recall the name of the drinks we had but they were good.  The food was very fresh.  The only one that popped in flavour was the tuna sashimi.  It was the best item that we ordered.  Rest of the items were fresh but were missing a zing that makes food pop.    I have to make it clear that I did get a call from management regarding an incident that occurred that night.  But I still can't justify giving 5 stars for this experience because of the unpleasant and unprofessional server.  Although I gave him a tip, it wasn't my typical generous tip.  He also couldn't find a receipt copy to give me.  Told me that I'll get an email since I charged it to my room.  Typically I give restaurants another chance, but not sure after this trip.",

(We did choose to wait but didn't think it would be an hour lol). The bread and butter they give you while waiting was freaking delicious. For alcohol, the Strawberry Spritz was good but my favorite wine they had was by far the Riesling. For appetizers we had the chilled shellfish platter, tuna shashimi, charred strip steak tartare, and the roasted beets and goat cheese. I'm very picky with seafood since I grew up catching and cooking my own fish but HOLY HELL it was good and tasted so fresh. And the tartare was TO DIE FOR. For the main dish I had the filet medium rare and it was cooked to absolute perfection and the flavor needed nothing else. However my friend got the bone in filet and hers was very chewy and wayyyyy too fatty. They tried to say it was regular marbling however half of it was straight fat (the other half was marbled. For dessert we had several dishes but the only ones we ended up eating was the coconut ice cream and the lemon semifreddo which was devoured before I could remember to take a picture  for the atmosphere it was nice but not what I had anticipated.",

All the kitchen options are amazing, you can eat as much of them as you want,  and you get an all you can eat seafood and dessert bar too. Combine this with being lakeside at the trippy straight-outta-west world natural water setting and you have he recipe for an absolutely perfect brunch. Try the Lemon Pancake with Blueberry butter!! Get here early (10AM) to get a table right next to the water.",

The weather was just perfect. The food had such great flavor and wasn't a tiny amount of food. The portion was pretty good for a high end restaurant. It was the perfect place to end our Vegas vacation with the non vegan in-laws. If I could give it 10 stars I would. We ate later in the evening so it was not crowded at all and it didn't make a reservation and they accommodate us after a show we saw. Must go! Can't say it enough. Especially for vegans!!! Great staff! Worth every penny!  Oh and the bathroom, I wanna swing on the chandelier!!",

The food was delicious, the customer service was amazingly perfected, the ambience was calm/romantic, and the view of the waterfall was exquisite. As far as the food goes, it is over-priced. The steak served here certainly isn't the highest grade filet, however it was close. I highly recommend getting the lobster mashed potatoes and the crab cake! The asparagus was flat out soggy and non-appetizing. If you're in the mood for a fruity cocktail, go with the strawberry fields. Oh, did I mention, quite pricey for the food you will be eating, but worth the experience.",

We started with braised meatballs and wild mushroom arancini. I ordered the crab bisque and Hawaiian day boat fish for my appetizer and entree. The crab bisque was alright. It didn't have enough crab in it. The fish fish, however, was served with two pieces of fish so the portion was more than adequate. But, the flavor wasn't bold enough to entice me to even finish one of the pieces. I needed more of the teriyaki sauce to put on the rice cake which was actually pretty good.  During dinner, people kept getting up and running to the windows to watch the rather bizarre water shows that occurred right outside the restaurant.  Considering the other dining establishments in the Wynn and Encore complex, Lakeside wasn't really up to par with those.",

If you are staying at the Wynn/Encore, or plan on spending time here seeing a show or gambling, this is a great location to enjoy the Lake at the Wynn and some wonderful, fresh, Hawaiian seafood.  I've eaten here twice recently and both times, the fish (flown in daily from Hawaii) has been expertly prepared.  Nothing is like eating fresh fish on the Islands, but if you can't be in Hawaii, this is a great place to enjoy the same flavors.  On my most recent visit this last week, I thoroughly enjoyed my Opah cooked Japanese style, with a side of fresh baby bok choi.  Perfectly cooked and full of flavor.  The restaurant offers lots of steak and seafood options, but I really enjoy being able to have fresh Hawaiian seafood.  You can select your fresh fish and then your choice of preparation.    The setting is beautiful, the service is excellent, and even the bread selection is amazing.  And don't forget yummy desserts!  Iced Tea Rating:  4 stars!  Delicious black tea (the same served throughout the Wynn) and plenty of refills.",

    "text": "The typical New American seafood restaurant, with the prerequisite fresh raw bar and delicious, fish offerings sauced and dressed to turn the good into the sublime.  Solid.  So why Lakeside?  One word:  lobsters.  Lobster lovers, this might be one of the few opportunities to try four of the worlds best cold water varieties side by side.  Grab a friend.  This tasting is four mains, over four pounds, and a $450 price (don't gasp, you know you paid more for other \"services\" in Vegas)  Simply roasted in a wood burning oven and served with drawn butter.  Light smoke permeates the dense tail meat, enhancing its flavor while maintaining its juiciness.  Pronounced flavor differences make for a mind blowing tasting.  My notes:  1. Maine - Classic.  Clean flavor with a hint of celery.  Well balanced sweetness.  Firm texture.  2. West Australian - Incredibly sweet.  Citrus and cucumber back flavor.  Not as firm as the others but far from soft, pasty texture of warm water lobsters.  3. South Australian - A powerhouse.  Complex sweetness mixed with a subtle hint of fresh seaweed and iodine (Hawaii yeeps, think ogo).  4. South African - A blank canvas.  Enhanced by anything on it (ie herb citrus butter).  Firm texture.  Deserving of mention, the grilled octopus with white bean salad, sherry vinegar, and roasted garlic aioli starter is a party in your mouth with its charred bitterness on the octopus, sweet and sour of the vinegar, heat from the garlic and a creamy, richness from the aioli.    The decor is modern and not for everyone.  Request an outdoor table.  Service is good with the only distraction from obnoxious diners taking calls on their mobiles.  Good wine list.  Resort prices.  Indulge.  It's Vegas!",

I gave my husband a bite, he too got shell in his bite.  I'm not talking little bits I'm talking about about an inch of shell. I sent it back.  The bread was good. Husband said his steak was great! We ordered The asparagus as a side. It had no flavor at all.   The restaurant was so loud and the tables were so far apart, it was hard to hold a conversation with my hubby during dinner.   Yes the view was great, service was horrible, my food was so bad I just had the bread for dinner.",

The fresh catch from the Pacific waters of Hawaii was the specialty of the house, so that is what we all ordered.  We all choose different accompaniments, so all if our meals were unique in taste and visual presentation.  The food was plentiful and very tasty, but the best part of the evening was the incredibly gorgeous waterfall view from the restaurant patio.  Every 30 minutes the waterfall ignited with light and displayed a new and different musical/visual performance.  It was so fun, so cool, and so Vegas!",

We came here for a wedding reception, including dinner, held in the separate room which can easily accommodate 50 guests. The reception & dinner was very nicely organized with an excellent selection of appetizers, starters and main courses. I went for the crab cake and fish option, both were excellent and tasty. As desert a beautiful wedding chocolate cake! Superb!",

    "text": "This is one of my favorite of the many excellent restaurants that Wynn Las Vegas offers.    First of all the place is absolutely stunning.  Located across from Wynn's premier SW Steakhouse, Lakeside sits right on the Lake of Dreams.  Patio dining at this restaurant, on a beautiful evening, is almost 2nd to none.  The service is professional and can be friendly but I've also noticed a little snooty at times.   I have enjoyed both the Chopped Salad and the Caesar but, the Manhattan Seafood Chowder is my favorite starter. The Shellfish Platter, Maryland Crab Cakes (sometimes I get this as my entree) and Steamed Littleneck Clams are all excellent.  The steaks that they offer, which are all scrumptious, are the same steaks that you would find at SW across the hall.  Lakeside's specialty is their seafood.  They feature several lobster options and also a variety of Hawaiian fish.  My favorite is the Opakapaka (Pink Snapper).  Additionally, the Lobster Risotto is absolutely excellent.  If you're in the mood for a steak and don't mind a little kick, I would recommend the Chili Rubbed Ribeye & Prime King Crab.   A little warning, the serving of crab is definitely on the light end. Want to pass on the spice? You cannot go wrong with the filet.  It literally melts in your mouth like butter.    Dessert Tapas!!!  Need I say more??? Probably not but I'm still going to. I love the dessert here. They are priced and sized to enjoy a few at a time. My favorite is the Key Lime Pie and the Strawberry Shortcake.   I noticed a lot of reviews mention that this restaurant is pricey. I firmly believe that you're getting exactly what you pay for here. Highly recommend!!!",

There was no wait and we were given an awesome table outside overlooking the Lake of Dreams. Very romantic and perfect for a special occasion!  Definitely recommend requesting an outside table to watch the show on the Lake of Dreams. It is a different show about every 30 minutes. The show makes dinner fun and spiced up the evening.   We started with the calamari. It was a generous portion. It had a little kick to it. I had the roasted jidori chicken. The only negative was that the chicken was on the bone, which made it a little difficult to eat. My boyfriend had a special that was a fish with lobster and scallops on it. It was really rich. We were too stuffed to order dessert. But the dessert menu looked great!",

We had Dover Sole and Snapper entrees that were very rich and cooked perfectly. Our fish was moist and perfectly seasoned. Also, I really enjoyed the whipped potatoes and how smooth they were.  Our table had a great view of the shows that ran every so often on the lake. I would recommend Lake Side to couples looking for a high-end date night.",

I made reservations and was running late so I called to let them know (which was appreciated) and while we waited a bit we were blown away not only by where we were seated...on the terrace front and center for the amazing light show overlooking the lake, but by our attentive server Brandy! After the wait at the chic bar, she made sure we were well taken care of! The wine selection was great, we ordered Rose and it was one of the best I've ever had. The seafood appetizers were delicious and the entrees ranging from surf to turf all looked delicious and were made with fresh, organic ingredients. The Mahi-mahi was delectable. I usually don't eat Mahi unless I'm in Hawaii but I'd never think otherwise. It was so fresh and prepared light and perfect. We also ordered the Lobster Risotto. Delicious! The sides were plentiful and Brandy never let our wine glasses get even close to empty. She made the experience even better and added extra little touches to keep us happy. We shut down the restaurant and went about our night happy, satisfied, and promising we'd be returning the next time we were in town.",

The waiter brings my salad provides me one turn of the pepper mill and runs off.   So I wait for several minutes and have to flag him down to ask for the pepper mill back. Next comes a steak that was medium well and if cooked 30 seconds more would have been well done.  Disappointed I wait until the waiter comes back and request a new medium steak.  Wait 15 minutes and get another medium well steak that is again 30 seconds more cooking away from well done.  To boot the spinach was lukewarm at best and lifeless.",

I have always enjoyed the food, but this last visit was below my expectations.  I ordered my steak medium; my husband ordered rib eye rare with a side of scallops.  When the meal arrived, the scallops were on my filet mignon instead of my husband's plate.  We told the server who brought out the meal, and I moved the scallops off my plate to my husband's.  After several bites of my filet, I noticed it was not cooked long enough.  The server agreed.  She offered to start cooking a fresh steak, or to put my partially eaten steak back on the grill.  Since we were going to see Le Reve at 9:30 pm, and needed to watch time, I said to just cook the filet a bit longer (it was nice that she offered to start fresh).  My husband's rare rib eye was overcooked.  We realize what happened - the kitchen cooked my steak rare instead of medium; and my husband's steak was cooked to my request - medium - and thus overcooked from his rare order.  That explained the mix-up with the scallops as well.  For over $200 for the meal (without wine) - I expected more and was disappointed.  The mashed potatoes were good; but the creamed spinach was only warm and not hot enough.  After a couple of very nice meals - I was underwhelmed with this last visit.",

From what I've ate here, and what Ive sampled from others I was there with, it seems like you cant make a wrong decision on meal selection. So why 4 stars not 5? Well one lets start with price. Im not cheap; In fact im in need of better decision making in terms of spending my money, but spending over $400 each time i visit is excessive. Sure I could go the cheaper route, but Im ordering what I want and thats not changing. The other reason this place gets 4 stars, is because my best meal I ever had, put my other times visiting here in perspective. The location of this place is awesome. Staff is perfect.

Presentation was beautiful and that's fantastic -  if you're not hungry... Lobster was rubbery and had no flavor. Actually had to ask for salt. Ended up salting and peppering to try and get something out of it. Risotto was also flat, could have been eating spackle. Co-worker ordered just a lobster tail and his was undercooked and had that weird undercooked rainbow sheen to it.

    "text": "I have been there twice so far and absolutely LOVE that place. It is located at the Wynn hotel overlooking the Wynn lake of dreams where you can enjoy a water and light show. So let's just say the ambiance is really nice. It is a seafood and steak restaurant  but they have, as in any Wynn restaurant, a very nice vegan menu. My boyfriend loves the calamari's appetizer, swears they are the best he has ever eaten. He also really enjoys the  lobster with a chili rub. He ordered the same thing on both our visits since he liked it so much. I had the arugula salad on both visits as my first course. I have a thing for arugula, it is my favorite type of green and the way they prepare it with lemony dressing is just fantastic! I also tried the crab cake as a main course on visit number 1 and the fried Gardein vegan chick'n with corn sauce the 2nd time. Both were really good. I asked for extra sauce both time. I loved the sauces! The second visit we were there with 2 friends who also loved their food. They all tried my vegan chicken, loved it and said they could have been fooled if not told... Well done lakeside! They had a vegan carrot cake as dessert  that was really small and yummy. Actually was perfect size since I was so full from dinner. It s definitively one of our favorite spot in Las Vegas for  fine dinning.  I can't wait to go again! :)",

    "text": "While my wife loved Lakeside, I thought it was little more than fare that tried to be imaginative, wrapped in mediocrity. The calamari was slightly better than average, coming with Ancho Chile Aioli, Chimichurri, Lemon dipping sauce. I used just lemon, finding that the sauce was, well, nothing special so why ruin passable calamari with it. Frankly, the chopped vegetable salad was the best dish I had, but at $16, again overpriced. I gave the Marinated King Prawns on Toasted Israeli Cous Cous, Salsa Verde at $38 a try and it was clear they tried to hard. They were jumbo and I were four in number, a more than reasonable portion for a dish that lacked flavor, or if it had it, I missed it. I have to idea what \"Israeli Cous Cous\" is, notwithstanding spending a lot of time in Israel, though the components were relative large, about the three times the size of regular cous cous. My wife had Pan Roasted Striped Sea Bass with Braised Fennel, Oven Dried Tomatoes, Saffron Sauce, which she characterized as very good but a tad dry.  It was my wife's birthday dinner and she selected the restaurant. She did enjoy immensely, though I think the ambiance had as much to do with it as anything else. We were fortunate enough to have them fulfill our request to be seated by the lake and the view, with the waterfall and dancing balls is wonderful. We very much enjoy the Bellagio's Dancing Fountains and thought this was almost, if not equal in entertainment.  Lakeside is clearly overpriced for the quality, though probably not for the quantity, as the portions were about the only thing that was perfect, other than the ambiance.  I suppose, overall, that was my major disappointment...but that my wife was happy with her selection and enjoyed herself mitigated that somewhat. Oh, knowing it was my wife's birthday, they did give her a small cupcake with a candle which she said was very good....not enough, however, to share.  This has been a rather prolix review for me, so I'll leave you with this thought: There are many far better restaurants in Las Vegas...skip this one.  Oh, and my repeated final note: It is neither polite nor classy to be tapping out messages or talking on cell phones in a restaurant. Save it for a truck stop. You're neither that important nor do you need to be that well-connected.",

Their Lobster Risotto is great, the organic chicken is good too along with their Prime Rib and New York Strip.  The best part of this restaurant is the waterfall/lake show.  Eat outside or at least indoors in front of the waterfall so you can see the mini-shows that go on.  They're soooo fun like the GIANT singing frog or the swimming balls that fall in love (yes...I said balls).  The water itself along with the trees light up in different colors throughout the night which brings a pleasant and romantic (if that's the purpose) ambience to the dining experience that other restaurants don't have in Vegas.",

I ordered the filet mignon, and my wife had the scallops, and both dishes were cooked to perfection.  When we arrived, we informed our waitress that we were seeing the 7 PM show of La Reve (it was our fault for poor planning), but our waitress informed the chef and had our food out with time to spare for our show.  This restaurant has only been open for a few weeks, but the ambiance and setting for this restaurant is definitely memorable.  From our table, we had a beautiful view of the cascading, multi-colorful waterfall wall outside the south side of the restaurant, which is all glass.  I don't spend much time at the Wynn when I'm in Vegas (mostly because I can't afford to), but this was definitely money well-spent, followed by one of the best Cirque De Soleil shows that I've seen in Vegas!  I highly recommend this restaurant with 2 enthusiastic thumbs up!",

You have to request this menu for some of the restaurants and its only for a certain time of day/night that you can order from it.  If you want to be entertained then you should grab a table outside for their water shows. But you can kinda still see the show from inside. Ive sat inside and out and still managed to see the show from inside. I had the chilled shellfish plater with some friends. Kind of disappointed that their wasn't that many pieces for us to share. From the taste of Wynn menu I had the crab cakes and caesar salad. Main course was oven roasted stuffed lobster tail w fregola pasta. The crab stuffing on the lobster was delicious and paired with 3 diff flavored butters to dip in. The desserts are petite but very tasty. You have a choice of two. I tasted the caramel apples, coconut almond bar bar, cappuccino cup, strawberry shortcake, triple coco cake(my fav), and butterscotch pot de creme.",

It felt awkward that he too did not make eye contact. Almost as if he was looking elsewhere for a queue card. The arugula salad was simple and delicious. The tuna poke was good, but not great. I could do better in my own kitchen. The bone-in New York was excellent and could feed two. The halibut was good as well.  These were probably the only highlights of the evening. The decor is full of vibrant orange colors.  Fine, but it felt like the hotel coffee shop would work out better with this decor.

    "text": "My husband and I decided to end our trip to Vegas with a fancy dinner out. The concierge at Encore, where we were staying, was very helpful making the reservation. Since it was over 100 degrees outside, we opted to dine inside. Luckily, we got a great table in front of the window overlooking the patio and the Lake of Dreams. This is definitely a nice restaurant (business casual, no shorts) but it wasn't overly pretentious or stuffy. The slightly funky decor and unusual music choices (Gwen Stefani, Michael Jackson) made it feel a bit more comfortable. Yet this is the type of place where they place the napkin on your lap and show you the bottle before pouring a glass of wine.  Our server was friendly and attentive without being pushy or intrusive. We started with the calamari, and it was the best I think I've ever had, not at all chewy or rubbery, with an even, crunchy fried coating. It was a large portion, too. My husband and I each had a plate of scallops for dinner and these were cooked to perfection, too. Melt-in-your-mouth on the inside with the perfect sear on the outside. We also split a side of king crab mac 'n' cheese, which we should have passed on. It didn't taste like anything special, just an odd-tasting mac and cheese. It also had peas sprinkled through it, which seemed strange.  I had expected this to be the kind of restaurant where you leave still hungry, but we were surprisingly stuffed. I had mentioned to the concierge that we were on our honeymoon, and the waiter brought us two complimentary mini-cupcakes with \"Congratulations\" written across the plate in chocolate syrup. We had a great view of the little lights and music show out on the lake. Our final bill wasn't as high as I was anticipating: about $135 before gratuity for a shared appetizer and side, two entrees (granted, some of the more affordable entrees on the menu), and one glass of wine. Not cheap by any means, but not bad by Vegas (and Wynn) standards.  It did get pretty busy by the time we were leaving, around 8:30 pm on a Wednesday, so make a reservation or dine earlier, like 7:30 pm or so on a weekday.   Visited June 2013",

    "text": "I visited this restaurant on a girls trip for our 30th birthdays. We were in the mood for seafood and had wanted to check out Wynn. So, Lakeside worked out great. We made reservations and were greeted at the hostess station. When it was our turn to sit, they said the reservation name, and we obliged. Apparently, the name they said was in fact not ours, and we misheard. We realized once they walked us to our table, which was in a private dining room with a pre-fixed menu (clearly not for us!). When I shared with the hostess that I think there has been a mistake, she berated me like a child stating that she \"said the name three times!\". So disrespectful! Your mistake is not my issue. I dismissed her and decided to approach a manager to address the situation rather than deal with her. I was assured he'd be right over to speak with me, which never happened. She must have let the entire waitstaff know her experience with us, because the whole time we were treated so inappropriately.   Here we are, six hard-working girls from all over the country coming together to celebrate each other, and we were treated as if we were 18 years old on spring break. I'd also like to make mention that none of us had been drinking, we were dressed our age, and all of us have an appreciation for a nice meal and are willing to pay the price. In fact, our only intention for our final night was to enjoy a relaxed, beautiful dinner together. We were so disappointed.   The food was subpar. My swordfish was okay, the scallops were good. Small portions, large prices. The waiter was not interested in sharing specials or suggestions with us.   I've been to so many restaurants in my life...I've had good, great, indifferent and bad service. My experience at Lakeside was by far the most insulting and negative dining experience I've ever encountered. Needless to say, I would never return, nor recommend this establishment.",

My fiance's entree was a real disappointment.  He ordered the filet, which had a char on it that was more of a charcoal flavored burn. It was also not cooked as he ordered it (a pet peeve of mine, if you don't know the difference between rare and medium rare you don't belong in a professional kitchen).  It also came with a \"chimmichurri\" sauce, which was not even close to being chimmichurri, it was more like salsa.   The worst part of dinner was dessert. We ordered the chocolate doughnuts, expecting a fluffy doughnut with a chocolate glaze on top. What we got was 4 pieces of raw dough that had been microwaved for 10 seconds and dipped in Hershey's syrup. They were gross.   The ambiance really saves Lakeside, watching the waterfall at night is stunning, and the drinks and service are great, but especially given the prices (everything listed above and 4 drinks was $180 before gratuity) I expect the food to be much better.",

The water shows every thirty minutes are  unique and very original.   However, we were very disappointed by the food. The chop salad was very sour and never of us enjoyed it. We did not like the bread either.  My girlfriend got the crab legs and they were really good but not worth the $86 price tag. (Much rather got to Joe's at Caesars for the stone crab but that just my preference).  I got the Maine lobster & it was the worst lobster I've ever had.  I would have much rather went to Red Lobster. I took two bites and couldn't even chew it was so over cooked and chewy.  My girlfriend took one bite and wouldn't take another.  I understand that this kind of thing happens but the biggest issue I had was with neither the waiter nor the manager on the floor asked if everything was okay.  I was extremely put off by this. I understand they are busy but I spend $87.50 on lobster that we took 3 bits of and no one said a thing to us. Overall, very cool place but the food we had was a let down & for the price tag we definitely won't be going back.",

We arrive, sit down & they send over some guy who clears tables to give us the bad news, it doesn't start till 10:30. Said it doesn't say that on the website, he agrees. We decide its not going to spoil our evening. This poor guy was their sacrificial lamb to give us the bad news. Nice of them, isn't it.   However we were on to the game they thought they were so clever in playing. It was a charity fund raiser, the difference in what they made  screwing the charity was nil compared to the good will they would of got. Good judgement trumped by greed. Now I after reading another post on here, someone else was told something different about the timing. Yet all of this was absent on the 3 Square website?  We've eaten at several dining places in the last 2 weeks. This isn't a new event in Vegas. They bait & switch using a fundraiser.      Have dined here a few times, I liked the food. Past tense. Last night was very underwhelming & the last time we dine there. The quality has been cut to squeeze out the biggest profit margins. Those into fine dining can see it. The descriptions would emphasis the most expensive ingredients & those would be missing or barely there. We've experienced this at the last few times we dined out at the Wynn. doubt if we'll be going back. But the beauty of Vegas is there are plenty more places to go.     After hearing/reading Wynn's greedy paranoid rants over the current administration, I said to husband, watch the quality of offerings go down on his properties.  Well its happened.  Never enough for these kind.   Next move will be Wynn charging using a form of measuring he understands very well - Grams.  Something has changed at the Wynn properties. The employees seem on edge, almost scared.",

If that is possible.  The lobster Mac and cheese looked a bit brown and strange, but was delicious and one of our favorite dishes.  To start, try the tuna poke or the king Crab and Guacamole.  Both were very tasty.  If you like foie gras, my friend said it was one of the best.  I had the key lime for desert which was a very small portion and perfect after a big meal.   The service was also incredible.  Very attentive.  My glass of tea did not ever reach 1/2 way because it was refilled.  Overall a great experience.  Not cheap, but great.   It's about $120-140 a person for what we ordered.",

Located downstairs of the Wynn, I absolutely fell in with everything at the Wynn and this restaurant and hinted how this hotel and restaurant is great for weddings/rehearsal dinner, boyf begged to disagree. (ouch) Either way, he booked on Open Table and in typical Persian fashion we arrived 10 mins late to our reservation. Even though, nothing mentioned on Open Table of preference of seating, we requested to sit on the patio upon arrival since there were in fact seats but the hostess wasn't the mostess and told us that those were reserved months ago. Boyf is Type A and always books things in advance and he was getting sassy; he booked way in advance as well. We came to a compromise and was seated across from the  patio but not on the patio.   Ordered a yummy pinot noir, had the lobster rubbed with tamarind butter and was out of its shell. We got a yummy summer salad and cream truffle spinach.  The wait staff push around three live lobsters in a bright crate for your picking-kinda sad but at least we know its fresh. Also, there is a show of lights and songs on the actual lake. We had a singing frog singing wonderful world.   Will come back for my friend's bachelorette dinner that I am planning.",

    "text": "Lakeside is a hard restaurant to give a rating to. Generally, I like to break it down into ambiance, service, and food. In this case, I want to add a fourth category of value for the dollar. In terms of ambiance, Lakeside gets a definite five stars. We sat on the patio right next to the lake and waterfall. SPECTACULAR. The tables are nicely spaced so you are not too close to other diners. And there is a \"show\" on the lake/waterfall about every 30 minutes that is just a lot of fun to view (a huge animatronics singing frog, dancing light orbs that procreate, musical laser imaging projected onto the waterfall, and more). Very entertaining. The service is a bit harder to rate. Our server came to the table almost immediately, explained the fish special, answered our questions about the menu, and took our drink order. He returned n a timely fashion to take our food order. However, after that we didn't see him again until the end of the meal. The food runners and busboy did a nice job bringing the food in a timely fashion and keeping our water glasses filled. But the waiter should really come by to make sure that things are going well. We had a couple of problems (minor) but no one to talk to. So for service, 4 stars at best. Next, the food. For the 4 of us, we got 2 tasting menus and 2 entrees and a side. The tasting menu, for $125 each, consists of 7 smaller courses that should give the chef a chance to show off what he is famous for. We had done this at Wynn's Country Club restaurant and it was one of the best meals I had ever eaten. Not so much here. It started with a caviar slider. Disappointing at best! While it was a very impressive presentation, all you tasted was the bread. Next came the seared big eye tuna. This was done very well, seared on the outside and near raw on the inside. Very flavorful. As good as I have had at Bone Fish or Kings Seafood locally. But not better. The remainder of the tasting menu was okay. Each was very impressive on presentation but just ordinary in flavor. Which brings me to my \"new\" fourth category - value. For $125, each dish on the tasting menu should knock your socks off with special preparation and flavor. This certainly didn't. For my separate entree, I ordered the tuna special, seared rare. It was quite good. At $48, much more than it would cost at one of the local upscale seafood restaurants for a comparable dish, but you expect to pay more on the strip, especially when they throw in the animatronics show. So Lakeside gets a begrudging 4 star rating from me. But will I come back? No! There are just too many upscale restaurants in this town that will knock my socks off at $500 for 4 people.",

    "text": "Lakeside is for when you're too cheap to pay to go watch Le Reve, but still want to treat your special someone to a show. Sit outside if it's not too hot/cold and if seating is available. You'll be treated to a dazzling display of colors, along with animatronic blue balls, colorful butterflies, and more. The show sorta incorporates all the feelings of a first date. All this takes place against a beautiful man made waterfall as a backdrop.  While we weren't able to grab a seat outside, the hostess put us in the next best spot. A seat in the middle of the gorgeous dining room looking out onto the water show. Once we were seated, the waiter placed a napkin on my lap. Not too sure I'm diggin' some of these fancy dinin' traditions.  They brought out a delicious looking spread of various breads. Unfortunately we were told only the raisin bread is Vegan. The guy did offer to swap out the butter for margarine. The raisin bread made for an excellent tasting appetizer.   I brought my girl here because I had read about the \"clam\" chowder. Clam Chowder was always one of my favorite things back in the day, and one of the few things I missed when I first went Vegan. Since I've never seen a Vegan version before I was excited to try it out. Now, my memory may be slightly hazy since It's been over 15 years but it tastes just like Campbell's used to make. I say that seriously since that's my memory of what clam chowder tastes like. It was pricey ($15) for a small soup but totally worth it. Besides with a cashew base, it's a very rich dish so you probably wouldn't want to eat a giant bowl of it anyways.  My sweetie and I both spotted the Old Bay \"Crab\" Cakes due to the fact the sexy orange menu description noted that it sits on a bed of toasted pasta. The idea of getting two meals in one sounded good to me. The \"crab\" cakes themselves were amazing. Even better than the pasta that originally drew us towards this dish. The chefs at all of these places in The Wynn really know how to dress up these Gardein products.  I'm not too keen on the sad looking lobsters being carted around from table to table being offered up for a boiling death at $95/lb. Something else that always annoys me at these high end restaurants is that they look at you like you have a dick on your forehead when you don't order \"enough\" food. Since we intended to sample many of the Vegan options throughout the Wynn during our stay, we only ordered the two things here. The waiter seemed to be disappointed by the fact that's all we ordered. It's ok dude, The Wynn as a whole will earn the majority of my spending money throughout this and future stays. I'm not gonna drop it all in one place when we're not even that hungry.  Other than that, Lakeside is a beautiful restaurant with delicious Vegan options that are sure to impress. I would come back here again once I tried all the other offerings in The Wynn first.",

Heaters outside so you can sit out there comfortably by the water. Pricey but if your looking at these reviews, your expecting it to be. Make sure you make a reservation in advance, i made mine 5 days in advance on a dead weekend and they only had limited time slots available. Steaks are phenomenal so is the lobster!!! Will be back next time we are in Vegas",

These are also good friends and I was not on a mission to get invited to the most expensive dinner I have been to in 4.67 years, but it ended up that way.  I did show them the oversized menu before we walked in to potential numb the pain of the final bill.  1) All the server staff from the check gals with the firm boobies to the the waiter staff all knew their stuff to the tee.  My buddy was trying to trump him on his alaskan king crab composition, and the chef was not intimidated.   2) Menu is really all you could hope for and more.  If you could not find your fav on this menu, then you only eat at McDonalds. 3) The ambiance outside having the waterfall \"shows\" as a backdrop is really 100% perfect.  Nice rhythm of mild to showtime to mild.  We ended up doing \"family style\".  Three big hungry guys.   We got the steak, two Cesar salads that they split up on three plates, potatoes, Chilean lobstar tails (2), sashimi and scallops....none of us had any alcohol and the bill was around $450.  More than I like to spend on a meal BUT you could not deny  that every morsel, and the service was really perfect.  Why not 5 stars, you might ask?  The same meal in mexico is $38.",

Large pieces of crab meat tossed in a light creamy dressing and served with avocado and plantain chips. I was in heaven. I could have done without the calamari. It was beautiful to look at, but the batter went soggy too quickly.   The drinks are really what brings Lakeside down. The apple sour was one of the worst drinks I have ever tried. The Sinatra Smash was much better. At this point in the night, I was done.   The service was good. My water never ran more than half empty and they kept a clean table.

We got a very nice table that was close to the buffet and had a view of the waterfall.  Our server was nice, friendly, attentive, informative and pretty darn handsome.    My rose sangria was probably the best I've had ever.  Perfect balance of flavors and sweet but not too sweet.  So glad I chose this to try.  The menu had a nice variety of items to choose from.  We ordered the fried chicken and mochi waffle.  That waffle though!  So gonna make that at home.    The seafood station was to die for.  Huge shrimp, sweet and luscious oysters, not too salty crab legs, an amazing crab salad and superb poke.    The hot food was good as well.  The tomahawks they were carving were cool and delicious.  I really liked the salads they presented.  The dessert station was the only thing I didn't like.  Maybe it's because I'm a pastry chef but I was unimpressed.  Everything felt not house-made and the sizing was off.  How can you have all one bite items and then a huge slice of diner cake?  I mean the cakes tasted good but they were too big.  Also, the pecan tart was hard as a rock.  How can you serve me this after I just had the BEST oysters and filet?  Sad.",

I love it there, especially at the Country Club Brunch.  that was wonderful and the the best smoked salmon I've ever had, and I'm from Seattle.  At the Country Club, the music was much better, actually New Orleans jazz, impeccable service and great food.  The Lakeside failed in comparison.  The \"boat of seafood\" was just fair, crab legs and shrimp, some veggies and cheese. All, rather boring.  I missed the waffles at Country Club and off the brunch menu steak when I wanted it. Lakeside had no such option.  $200 later and now I'm still hungry, I will not go again.  But it was an experience, however,  I'm waiting for Country Club to re-open, a classier clientele as well..",

    "text": "Amazing restaurant with great vegetarian options!    The bf and I were fortunate to get dinner reservations at this upscale restaurant the day before our visit, a Sunday at 8PM.  Outdoor seating by the Lake of Dreams with its huge curtain waterfall (which is where the one-minute light/water show plays every half hour) was booked so we ended up inside. The interior of the restaurant was dimly lit and of amber, gold, red and white modern retro decor.  The atmosphere inside was relaxed and quiet enough for conversation.  Every seat inside the restaurant had a view of the outdoor waterfall through the huge window so even if you are seated inside, you can see parts of the show.  The menu housed a wide selection of mainly seafood and meat options.  A separate vegetarian menu which had a wonderful variety of options was available upon request.   From the vegetarian menu, we ordered the roasted mushrooms, the crab cakes, the Beef Wellington and carrot cake. From the regular menu, we ordered the Market Salad, Scottish Salmon paired with Grgich Hills, Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.  Before our meal arrived, 2 small bread baskets were delivered to our table- one with a regular variety of bread with regular butter and the other with vegan bread and vegan butter.   Our ordered food arrived in a timely manner and everything was artistically plated and absolutely delicious.  The carrot cake was especially amazing for being vegan.    Our charming waiter, Chas, was professional, very  well versed in the menu, patient, friendly and attentive.  Other staff was great, too!  Restrooms matched the decor of the restaurant and were clean and functional.   The outdoor 1 minute shows were fun and entertaining and were different each time.  Dress code was business casual.  As far as upscale restaurants with vegetarian options in Vegas go, I'm sold on this restaurant.  We will be back!  Solid 5!",

My transgender friend and I were all dressed up and ready to dine at the wynn Lakeside restaurant. We each had 300 bucks in our pocket and Were ready to spend it all and have a great evening. When we requested a table by the water fall the front desk lady/manager Christine said that my friend would need to be in pants, Rather then shorts. I said to the manager Christine, But I'm in shorts, I'm allowed to wear them why can't my friend Bella? My transgender friend Bella stated that she indeed was transgender and was transitioning and that this was discrimination. Then Christine said that you still look like a man and were presenting yourself as a male (which is absolutely cruel and intolerant of all LGBT community )My friend Bella is so courageous for going through this transition she doesn't need insanely rude people like Christine to remind her of her stage in her transition. We were told we would not be able to dine there unless Bella put on Pants ( instead of knee high shorts) For one,  we are in 2019 this type of discriminatory behavior between the male and female sex is should be blacklisted. Number two we had money to spend and the Wynn forever lost our business. Christien needs to be fired. And the wynn rules and regulations need to be revised immediately.",

Very nice greeting at the restaurant. Our waiter Marek did an excellent job. Very attentive, very polite.   The bread baked in their in-house bakery is just incredible. The cheddar herb rolls were addictive.   I loved the vegan smoked mushroom chowder while my wife had a very tasty Caesar salad.  Great dressing but maybe slightly too much of it.   We both had the snapper. Lakeside advertises the snapper as having been caught in Hawaii 24 hours ago. I don't know if that's possible, but I'm not sure I've ever had a better piece of fish. There was a curry fish broth that added a little bit of spice to the salty fish, which was covered by a sour carrot slaw.  Snapper cooked perfectly.    Was a perfect meal. PERIOD. Only regret was too full for dessert.",

Sat outside for dinner great view of the lake didnt like the the lake shows were  unfitting for fine dining restaurant a little too hoakie. Service was excellent! Had crab avocado for appetizer was a good amount to share, lots of crab and very good with the taro chips. Main entree did the swordfish with a glass chardonnay recommened by server and was excellent! Green sauce under it complimented the fish and was not dry cooked well with still juices which can be tough to get with swordfish. My friend had the salmon minus all the dressings and fish was still good. Portions for the price were fair. Was what I expected great fresh tasting seafood, service, and ambiance. I will opt to sit inside though since show kinda would ruin the ambiance for me.",

I loved it from the moment I stepped inside. The staff were wonderful, attended to every detail, the service was superb and the food is SPECTACULAR!!! The seafood was super fresh, cooked to perfection and absolutely delicious. The fresh seasonal oysters were fabulous! The lobster was divine!!!! Coming to this restaurant is an \"experience\" to be savored. It looks out over a lake with a curtained waterfall and there is a short show that happens using the waterfall as a backdrop that's totally brilliant every 30 minutes. If you are looking for a high end restaurant that has it all and more then this is for you. If you want to be transported to sublime wining and dining then come to Lakeside!",

We had to ask for our bread and they forgot the coke we ordered, when we got the bill and paid with a credit card he asked for my husbands ID in a pretty rude way.

I can see why people would expect a lot, since the competition is tough as sh*t. But putting other restaurants aside, I did enjoy my meal here. The food and service were great, and the place was very very pretty :)  I came here with my bf's family (+ a friend) for my bf's brother's birthday. The good thing about going with his family is - they don't seem to have a budget for food (or anything, really). Big, wealthy gamblers.. lol yup.  Anyway, they ordered two chilled seafood platters, a couple small plates of foie gras, a dozen kumamoto oysters on the half shell, and one fried calamari dish for appetizers. This was appetizers for 6 people lol... a bit much, but I wasn't complaining.  The seafood platter came with cocktail shrimps, king crab legs, lobsters, ceviche, and oysters. The oysters (both from the platter and the kumamoto) were as fresh as it gets, and comes with the usual tabasco, cocktail sauce, etc. BOMB. I love raw oysters. The cocktail shrimps were huge and crisp, and although it was probably as good as cocktail shrimps get - they were outshined by the lobster and king crab legs. Lol, but of course. Everything on the platter was great though - fresh and flavorful.  I ordered the rib eye cos I was feelin meaty, and it was YUM. It came with a chimichurri sauce that was a bit spicy and it paired well together. It had this delicious peppery char on it, mmmmmm.. I only ate like 15% of it though... the appetizers filled me up good :( My bf ordred the rib eye as well, and added a bacon and blue cheese crust. It was GOOOOOD. We also had sides of mashed potatoes, lobster mac and cheese, and asparagus. Mac and cheese was just ok, but I didn't try the other sides.  The birthday boy ordered a 5 pound lobster because why not........................ which totaled to $575........ which puts it at $115 per pound. WTF. LOL. I mean, it was shocking.... but I suppose not that surprising...... haha. I did get to try it, and it was amazing. Succulent, fresh lobster meat, and I LOVED the green dipping sauce. Maybe like a basil-y butter sauce? SOO delicious.  So like I said, I enjoyed my experience here. Oh and the show at the lakeside... lol, they were weird I guess. Very whimsical but also kind of random... floating, colorful balls and singing frogs among other things. LOL but I don't really care about that stuff. The meal was wonderful :)",

She first told me that it's my guest's choice that didn't ask for another glass at the first beginning, and she brought up the normal whiskey instead of Yamazaki which caused my guest headache. After this unpleasant beginning, we found the crab shell in our avocado appetizer and another shell in my lobster risotto! At this point, i was totally disappointed. For over $400 bill, I would expect better experience!!",

My friend saw Mr. Wynn dining in the restaurant the night before my meal. Lakeside is an experience but I am too starstruck by all the celebrity chefs starting restaurants (even if they never visit their Las Vegas creations) and therefor  I find it hard to recommend that you spend one of your few meals at lake side.  For non-foodies: If you do not live and breathe food and you'd rather pay for spectacle than a chefs name then you may think lake side is a more exciting restaurant then the  other places that keep the surprise and delight confined to the menu.",

We arrived a few minutes after nine, instead of hello or good evening, the first comment we got from the \"greeter\" is we cannot dine there since my husband is wearing \"sandals\" - now let me be clear, first he is not wearing flip flops (as ladies that wore friggin havaianas sat down to eat!!!!!) but he was wearing $1000 leather sandals. Regardless the obvious and obnoxious gender discrimination(!), their confirmation (photo attached) does not say ANYTHING about shoes. Even though i stated that to the manager he kept repeating the same thing like a robot. The greeter kindly suggested he can go home and change. Seriously? I live thirty minutes away, and Im hungry.  As a local, I will never go back to dine in Wynn.  Thank god for Aria's Jean George's - where I am always welcomed!",

The service was average at best, which was likely the worst part of the experience. Again, being at the Wynn, I'd have expected better. Items were forgotten, waitstaff skipped some of our party when checking in, and Lakeside's idea of an iced coffee is to bring you a glass of ice and then pour hot coffee from a carafe into the glass right at the table.  For such a high standard that I hold the Wynn to be at, and I do love the resort, Lakeside didn't meet what I was expecting. There is an all-you-can-eat seafood buffet but it wasn't overly special. There is a menu you can order select dishes off of and this menu I left being more impressed with than the buffet. The eggs benedict was good, but small as you only received one half of an English muffin and not two. The pancakes were good.  Overall, I think you can find better places to spend your money.",

Beautiful lights and everything is opened up. The whole place is stunning.  They are known for their seafood and they have the freshest fish. There was a huge bed of ice with lobster, king crab, and their daily market items  We started off with oysters, and a bunch of appetizers. And they were so good! Our waiter was fabulous and he gave amazing recommendations. I had the halibut with lemon and it was so light and cooked to pefection. We also had lobster, steak, salmon. It was all amazing!  Since it was my sisters birthday they came out with birthday cake shots and a huge whole chocolate cake! The cake was massive and so beautiful!! They boxed up the huge cake for us and then brought out a cute smaller version for us to eat there!   I am blown away with this place and I can't wait to go back!!!",

But, there were two interesting types bread; one was like a chive with garlic and the other one was cheese with garlic, they were both amazing. The butter had some spices on it for added flavor.   For the appetizers, we got the shrimp cocktail and the crabcakes. Both appetizers were great with their accompanying sauce.   I had the ribeye with a lobster. I ordered my ribeye medium & chard. It was cooked perfectly. For the sides, we got lobster mashed potatoes and some king crab mac & cheese. We love the mashed potatoes and it had lots of lobster.

Bread and pastry's was super yummy  Service: we were seat close to the band and  the kitchen. They bring around pastry's and another tray that we never knew what it was cuz it never made it to us.

For my entree, I ordered the ribeye and added scallops to it. We shared the asparagus and mashed potatoes which were excellent.   The ribeye had great flavoring and the scallops were large, very fresh and good. But the train fell off the tracks when I found a large hair on my plate. The manager took my plate and they later brought me a new steak. That was appreciated and they comped my steak as a result. I still got charged for the scallops which I thought was wrong. They were on the same plate after all. I will give a shout out to Brandy, our server, though. She was attentive and nice and had a great personality.",

    "text": "We came here for Sunday jazz brunch and it was awesome. Because it was Sunday morning it wasn't as packed or crowded. It's 68 per person and seafood selections are cocktail shrimp, crab legs and oysters and some poki. And this selection is unlimited along with the dessert bar and a la carte menu items. We ordered the Benedict, fruits, fruit parfait, steak frites, and salmon. Steak was a little hard to cut and too chewy to bite and swallow- maybe because I got medium rare. Salmon and the Benedict was okay. the yogurt parfait was by far my favorite- the lemony zest taste to it was the best part. I ordered two of this!  The view is absolutely gorgeous on a sunny breezy morning. It is so calming to just sit and enjoy the sun.  Four stars because the seafood selections were not fresh... especially the crab legs. Everyone should be careful of seafood choices on a summer day though... and I felt like the waiter with Pastries were only going around more so inside than outside so I didn't get to try any pastries until I was done with my meal...",

Brunch dishes are all expected egg and steak and burger type of foods. These are made to order and are paced well. Small plates with the omelet a scene stealer and must order. Steak is good (fries, eh) as well but the rest were just average dishes on made to order side. Pastries and desserts were as good as any buffet. Small sizes but super flaky and fresh. Lemon pie and cake pops super good and the chocolate croissant mind blowing. Oysters and crab legs and shrimp cocktail on display as well. Quality is fine with crab but tough to break open. Oysters were tiny but considering all inclusive makes the price worth it as a dozen of these would be $40 on its own on strip. Drinks fine and ambiance great. Love jazz is throughout the meal 10-2, but they're kind of in the back of the room so not an intimate experience. But not too loud and service is good until it gets close to 2pm and then they get antsy and start ignoring you. So come here and get your fill on raw bar and Prosecco. $100 late lunch may be pricey but vibe is phenomenal and think of it as a show meal with music and view. Better than Sterling Brunch but I always prefer a good meal to a brunch and pacing rather than stuffing my face.",

    "text": "Lakeside totally exceeded my expectations! This was my first time at a fine dining restaurant at the Wynn and it was one of the best meals I've ever had. We got to sit outside next to the man made lake. The lake is beautifully lit and has a massive waterfall that provides a tranquil ambient background to your dining experience.  First of all, I've never had such a delicious bread basket before a meal. It came with three different types of bread, all of which were delicious, and butter with olive oil and Himalayan salt. I loved that our waiters didn't shame us at all when we asked for a second basket...must happen a lot! The appetizer we ordered, the King Crab and Avocado, was amazing. My boyfriend can't stop talking about it days later. Both of our entrees, the lobster risotto and sea scallops, were also delicious. The seafood tasted so fresh, flavorful, and succulent.  We ended our dinner with a smoked s'mores dessert (because I am a s'mores fiend) and coffee. They brought the dessert under a bell jar full of smoke and it made it taste JUST like a freshly charred s'more.  All of the wait staff were excellent - attentive, helpful, and professional. I was so impressed with the food, the service, and the experience at Lakeside.",

    "text": "We dined at Lakeside on Saturday night while staying at Encore. My husband booked the reservation on OpenTable almost two weeks in advance. On Thursday he received a call from the receptionist confirming our reservation and quite rudely asking if we 'understood the dress code of long pants and close toed shoes for gentleman'. We were celebrating our anniversary so we said we'd be dressed for the occasion. Yet, while dining at Lakeside we witnessed numerous patrons in the dining room in shorts and non-collared shirts. My thinking is, if you're going to make sure your guests 'understand' the dress code, you need to enforce it.  Our server Alex was absolutely phenomenal, he honestly was the best part of our evening. Kudos to him for helping us order and giving my husband the lobster of his dreams. I was not impressed with the sommelier. I had been asking about a bottle of Gruner, a grape variety that I had tried in Australia, but the bottle they had on the menu was from Austria, so I wanted to understand what the different region would have on the impact on the taste. He didn't have an answer but instead recommended two different Italian varietals that were double the price of the bottle I was looking at. I'm all for recommendations, but I believe you should stay within at least the same range of bottle as being asked about.  I had the bone-in filet, nothing to write home about, however the tuna sashimi was very good. Honestly, way overpriced in my opinion.  Don't think we'd eat here again or recommend to friends and family.",

    "text": "We stayed at the Wynn were going to see Le Reve later so we decided to dine at the Wynn too. After looking through all the restaurants that the hotel had to offere we chose Lakeside for the view and the more affordable prices. Yikes were we wrong! Our dinner ending up being over $200 and it wasn't even that good. Portions are small and over priced for what they are. They gave us bread and butter at the table and we ordered the crabcakes as appetizer and it was good. I also ordered one of the specials that was not on the menu - crab, guacamole, and corn salad...what I got was more like a chip and dip so I don't know why they would call that a salad AND it was $22! For drinks we ordered two glasses of red and entrees were a rib eye steak, seared foie gras, corn succotash, and scallops. The seared fois gras was the size of half your palm, was $22, and not that great. The rib eye was a little bit too rare but was probably the best thing we ordered. It had a nice seared crust and the steak came with a sweet tomato salsa that was pretty good. The scallops were cooked perfectly but the puree that it came with I could have done without. Four scallops for $39. Thomas our waiter was very nice and I had made a reservation with comments saying we were celebrating our anniversary so when we declined dessert he insisted that he bring us something from the kitchen to celebrate. Two mini red velvet cupcakes with happy anniversary chocolate on top. We had originally requested seating outside next to the lake and waterfall and when we checked in the host asked if we still wanted outside because it was rather warm and suggested that we test the weather outside before making our decision, that was nice. Service was good, food was mediocre, prices were high.",

We almost didn't walk down the 'grand staircase'. But we did. So much for second guessing the quality of the food by the name of the restaurant. The food was great! We had: uber fresh, briny, sweet oysters on the half shell--YUM!, a generous serving of thin sliced Iberico ham (but not paper thin) served with arugula, small wedges of manchego cheese, green olives in olive oil and grilled ciabatta points, super soft grilled octopus served nestled on a tasty white bean salad with sherry vinegar and roasted garlic aioli, braised wagyu short ribs with gnocchi, parmesan cheese, roasted tomatoes, english peas, and flavorful wood fire grilled lemon garlic king prawns. The food was fresh and the flavors bold and forthright. No complaints about the food at all. The food was deeeelish! The 'show' in the 'magic pond' (aka the pond of dreams) was entertaining and great photo op amusing. Our waitperson, Douglas, was personable, polite and very accomodating when we asked to be moved indoors (the outdoor tables were too cold for us). So, the flaws with this reastaurant?...The outdoor patio is the place to be, however, the outdoor 'heaters' don't throw off enough heat to keep the outdoor patio diners warm and cozy. We had to ask to be moved indoors. Unfortunately the indoor tables lack the 'ambiance' of the outdoor tables. The lighting in the indoor dining area is bright and when combined with the modern dining room tables and the overall modern decor, feels jarringly harsh. The combination of the bright light and modern furniture gives the dining area a 'cafeteria' feel. So, to summarize, great food, junk name for the restaurant -- come on--you guys at Wynn can come up with a name more creative than \"Lakeside\"? and junk ambiance in the indoor dining area (too bright and not cozy).",

    "text": "We are a local couple who eat out frequently and have tried many of the fine restaurants in Las Vegas. It was a surprise the Daniel Boulud was closing. What a shame that a fine eating spot died and the exquisite space filled with overpriced mediocrity. After taking in the great show - Sinatra - we decided on a late night bite and thought about trying the new Lakeside Grill. Without a reservation, we waited around 10 minutes to be seated in what looked to be a half empty restaurant. The nice woman at the reception desk lead us to our table and got us seated. That was about the best treatment we had, considering the hyped up status of the place. A polite young man took our drink order and promptly came back with a bottle of Pellagrino. Our waiter showed up soon thereafter and handed us the menu. I am totally used to paying decent money for good food and service to match, but I was sort of surprised to see the prices on this menu. I think $50 for a 9oz Fillet Mignon is a little high. Everything is ala carte. We were not starving and decided that we were just going to order a quick lite bite - Strip Steak Sliders, fries, and braised greens. The steak sliders were $7 a piece, 10 bucks for the fries, and 10 bucks for the greens. The sliders consisted of a mini slice of steak stuck in the groove of a sliced mini-baguette. The fries were great - but $10? Greens were so-so. Bottom line - $60 for some mediocre snacks is a joke. I am glad we did not go for a full blown meal. Oh - one more little thing - after the waiter took our order - we never saw him again. Not once. Later in the meal, another woman came by to clear the plates and ask if we wanted any desert. She also brought the check. For that kind of money, someone should have asked if we were satisfied with our meal. nuf said -I warned u. Many better choices. Walk over to Encore - Society Grill.",

First, we walked in with no reservation and although there were multiple tables available at the \"lake side\" the entire time we were dinning, we were told that those are reserved for people who make reservations.  So yes, I joked with the guy about going outside and calling him... but, in fact we were \"punished\" and had to eat inside for being walkins!   Next, I know this place has a $$$$ rating , but we didn't know that, and what was shocking to me was that there was no bottle of red wine available under $70.  Period. Zip. Never seen that on the strip before. Next, the food...  I had the scallops, and my wife had the Lobster risotto, and while it was ok, it was highly unremarkable for the price.  Also, the portions are \"euro style\" so if you are a hungry American used to decent sized portions, better give it a miss. Finally, the \"shows\" over the water are really tacky.. there's one with a giant mechanical frog that sings \"it's a wonderful world\" and then some \"dancing colored balls\" on the water that act like a flirting couple that eventually has a baby ball!?!  Embarrassingly tacky at the very least and just makes you shake your head.  Imagine the people in a meeting designing that... \"yeah, and then we'll have this giant frog sing on top of the waterfall!  It will be amazing!.. Yeah!\"    Suffice to say, this was sufficiently bad as to assure we never step foot in the Wynn again.  There's plenty of choice in Vegas after all.",

    "text": "Food: Great quality, but there is better quality around Vegas. For the price,  I expected better. During our 20 minute bar wait (see below) we had their Lobster Mac & Cheese. That was amazing! The bread was also really unique and delicious. I had the \"Saute'ed Atlantic Sea Scallops', with celery root puree, apple chutney, and vandouvan sauc. It was four pieces, nothing special. She had the Roasted Organic Chicken. She didn't even finish it, but said it was really good. Our desert was the Smores, which was unique and really good. It's strong point was the graham cracker, and it's weakpoint was that it had too much fudge, and a little too much salt. I hate to sound too picky, but at a restaurant like this, I think you invite scrutiny.  Atmosphere: Beautiful, 5/5, perfect.   Service: Not the best we've ever experienced, but far from the worst . We reserved a table at 8pm on the lakeside area. When we arrived, we were taken to a table in the inside. When we told the host that we really wanted an outside table, he advised us to wait in the bar. We waited 25 minutes, before I went back to the host to see what the status was. He quickly and nervously said, 'Ah! We're ready for you!' We saw a few open tables on the outside, and I think he may have forgotten about us. :\\  When we were seated, the staff was very attentive, except for the very end, where they forgot to give us our desert (after a 12 minute wait) and handed us our bill instead. When she realized, she didn't ask us if we still wanted any, she bolted to the chef counter and we were given the desert about 3 minutes later.  Conclusion: No one is perfect. All in all, this was a good experience, and I would go again.",

    "text": "Went to the new Lakeside Grill over the weekend for the first time, not impressed. It's like an upscale diner that serves typical Vegas food, steak, fish, risotto and pizza... I'm not sure what the exact concept of the restaurant is, american or italian? I shared the lamb and lobster risotto with my boyfriend, the lamb was undercooked and they had run out of white truffles for the lobster risotto, our friend ordered the prime rib which was so undercooked that it wasn't edible, our girlfriend ordered the dover sole but didn't like it, sent it back and ordered a salad instead. Overall I wouldnt go here again, nor would I recommend it to any of my friends, it's overpriced and probably the worst restaurant at the Wynn, definitely doesn't fit at the wynn. The only good thing about this restaurant is it is in the old location of Boulud, which looks over the lake of dreams at the Wynn.",

The food - good variety of bread, had the pork loin and a side of truffle mac and cheese. To die for! The pork chop had this great layer of breaded herb stuff on top and it was cooked perfectly. Wife had a filet and was very happy with it. This place has a perfect vire for the Lake of Dreams and in the middle of dinner an acapella from South Africa came in and sang. It was very cool, except a lot of people seemed to ignore them which was a sad sight because they were very good. Even with all the restaurants in Vegas, this will be a comeback stop.",

We carefully booked the table after making reservations making certain that we had time to dine before the show. This was to be a special evening celebrating our 50th anniversary and our son and daughter -in-laws first anniversary.  We were hustled by the wait staff after being made to wait by a bar and sipping $20.00 glass of wine.  When seated we were given liquor choices.  My husband took one, I had hoped to have my wine included in this (not) and my son and daughter in law had iced tea, also not included. My salad was wonderful but the lobster with risotto ordered by two members of the party was not eaten due to over salting.  I ordered vanilla ice cream (up charge of course) and wondered what we had for $360.00.  The water show was colored waterfall and a stuffed frog sang.  Really??? The stars are for the ambiance.",

    "text": "Reservation-seater problem. The hotel owner kept telling about Lakeside on TV, and what a great chef is there. So we reserved a table there the day before from our room in Wynn and asked for outside one. On the phone they told us about great food there and dressing rules, so we dressed up. When we came in, they asked us to wait. We ordered a couple of drinks. In 20 minutes the seater calls us to follow her and leads to the inside table at the entrance. We were really confused. Why we waited 20 minutes, if the restaurant inside was less than half full. We told her that we ordered an outside one. She asked, did we say to the hostess here, that we want on \"the patio\". No, when we were reserving from the room we asked \"outside\".  She didn't check and just said, that they don't have this information and if we want the patio, we can wait, but she will put us down on the list, so it will take an hour or more. This sounded like ultimatum, and we got a feeling we had no choice, so we sat down at the table. But the sitting was not comfortable - entrance and under the air conditioner. We didn't want to spend $200 like this. My husband approached the main hostess and explained her the situation, she was very courteous and professional and we moved outside.   Ambiance and service. The lake is beautiful and shows are interesting. Waiters are friendly and courteous.  Food. Everything was delicious, but the highlight is spice crusted big eye tuna. That chef and cooks did a great job.  Overall, I guess it would be a much better experience if not a reservation-seater problem.",

Nice ambiance, table outside and fun with the Lake of Dreams show. Considering the cost I thought that the bright orange plastic menus were a little cheesy. The service was good but again at a place like this I would expect excellent. For apps we had the crab and avacado dish which was just ok and the crab cakes which were delicious but small. The chef also sent us fried risotto balls any they were fantastic. For entrees we had Swordfish, Halibut, the Lobster Risotto and the Scallops. The entrees were good but my main complaint was that none of it was very hot. I want my food served piping hot and I tried three of these dishes and they were barely warm. We also ordered the beet salad and the crab mac n cheese. I had read good things about this mac n cheese so I was really looking forward to it and it just didn't stack up. It was overly cheesey and just kind of gross. The bread basket was fantastic as well as the drinks.",

    "text": "After a great experience on my husbands 59th (see review) We returned to Lakeside for my husbands 60th, when I called to request outside, Lucy,at the desk berated me like a bad child,saying I had NO chance. When I got to the manager he finally said \"we will do all we can for you\" (all I was asking).We were seated 45 min late (which was ok, because we did get an outside table) our nice server ,already had too many tables,which was no problem, because we were in no hurry.  Which was a good thing since the dinner took forever. No problem until they sat a group of 30 (very demanding and loud group) next to us, then we became invisible. We had to ask for each course and ask  to have plates removed. We had the seafood appetizer which was great, a salad/soup course (the lobster bisque was ok at best) then steaks which were good.  But, to have to flag down someone to take away the dirty plates, each course was annoying and they made no apologies for this group that screamed from table to table and kept bumping our seats When the server was bringing the check and I reminded him of my husbands 60th (which I had put in the reservation and certainly mentioned a dozen time to reception)  he had the busboy bring a minicupcake with a candle (something you would pick up at walgreens (the obnoxious guy at the next table leaned over and said \"you couldn't afford a real cake?\" That was the kicker!!  I complained to the female manager who dismissed me with a \"this is what we do!\" When I said last year, they brought a lovely dessert with happy birthday \"written\" on the plate, she dismissed me with a \"well, that must have been a special arrangement\"   No apology, no questions about our meal, just irritation.    The only reason I am not giving a \"terrible\" is because the Manager Alex was accommodating, and the food was good.   This was the only thing we \"preplanned\" for his big 60th birthday, so we probably had too high of expectations (expecting the service we had last year).  I can no longer recommend Lakeside Grill.",

Lakeside is next to the SW, Steve Wynn's signature restaurant.  Upon entry, nothing spectacularly appealing as far as decor. But the staff was very courteous and friendly.  It is an upscale restaurant ad priced accordingly.  I love children, but this is and can be a romantic restaurant and I did not see any children here.  Wait staff was extremely knowledgeable regarding wine and the food and was very prompt. We started off with some crab cake appetizers, which were excellent, and then sauteed mushrooms.  We added asparagus because we all like it and it was fantastic.  But the best thing we ordered was the Yukon Gold creamy mashed potatoes.  Outstanding.  We may have never had mashed potatoes this good.  For dinner, I got the Salmon, which was large and delicious in itself, but I did not care for the base sauce and onions.  Friends got steak, which they said was delicious. For dessert, we finished it off with three types of sorbet.  Hit the spot after such a nice meal.  Aside from the bland decor, everything was excellent and hope to return.",

The menu looked so appetizing, however the food was terrible.  Two of us ordered the lobster risotto, one ordered the pasta with prawns & a scampi sauce and the other ordered the short rib pasta.  The lobster risotto sounded so promising.  What a disappointment!  It was terrible.  We kept joking around that they pulled out a box of broccoli & cheese rice-a-roni and threw in a tiny piece of lobster to spruce it up a bit.  Both pastas were so mediocre.  Olive Garden has better food than this.  All of these dishes were around $35.  Originally planning on going to SW, we knew we would be paying out of our noses for dinner, so paying $35 for pasta wasn't that big of a deal.  However, $35 for crappy, half-ass food is a crime.  If you ever come across this place, turn around and run as fast as you can.  What a waste of money and what could have been a great Vegas dining experience.",

LakeSide is lucky to have great food because the service was not great for a $300 dinner for two.   Food: was amazing! New York strip, lobster, crab Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes were amazing!

    "text": "My husband and I have been wanting to come here for sometime, but because it is a fine dining restaurant, we really needed a good reason to come. So we came to celebrate my birthday and our wedding anniversary.   My husband easily and quickly made reservations online and added to the notes what we were celebrating and that we would prefer patio seating.  A few hours before our dinner reservation, my husband received a call from the restaurant to confirm our reseravations. My husband also took the opportunity to ask what the dress code was and they did let him know that it was business casual. It's nice to get dressed up when my husband loves his t-shirts, shorts and sporting his kicks.   Upon arrival, because of our request, we waited for a bit. During this time in the bar area, my husband got a chance to enjoy a \"STELLA!\" Apparently something my husband and the bartender have in common on how to say Stella Artois.  While waiting, instead of a dessert cart or dim sum cart wheeling through the restaurant, it was large very alive lobster cart. Apparently, the Maine lobsters don't even compare to the lobsters served by Lakeside. The most expensive and largest lobster feeds 8 people, which includes the whole lobster and the meat goes through half the  body and into the legs. It is an Australian lobster at $178/lb. Great learning experience, but not in my budget. Additionally, I am not much a lobster person and prefer crab. I learned from my father and have experienced that the larger a crustacean,  the tougher the meat and lacks flavor.    As our table was ready, the hostess led us to the patio where we were met by the restaurant manager to wish us a happy birthday and anniversary. Apparently, the seat they had for us is the best in the house and I would agree. We were able to see everything and enjoy the \"cultured\" watershow.   My husband ordered a glass of syrah. As I get older, alcoholic drinks just makes me tired. So I ordered a refreshing raspberry fizz. I also recommend ordering the bottled water as the house water does not taste filtered. They serve Fiji water.   Being from HI we appreciated the Hawaiian fishes that were available. The bread selection included little french baguette, foccacio and naan. The naan was my favorite as it was made with furikaki (sesame seeds and seaweed flakes). For starters, my husband enjoyed the oyster Rockefeller and we shared my king crab chowder. My husband loved his starter and the chowder, not only tasty but filling.  My husband's entree was a medium chili pepper rubbed rib eye with grilled crab leg. The steak also had two grilled chili's on top so there was a small portion of his steak that was a little too spicy for him. The steak portion was large that my husband could eat only half of it. I ordered the Hawaiian sea bass. You can choose from 4 preparations, I went with the Mediterranean which included artichoke, olive oil. The fish was a little smaller than my fist and it was thick. I felt the outside of the fish was cooked just a little too much that I used a knife to cut through. However, the inside was cooked perfectly. For our sides, we ordered the lobster poutine and bok chow. They definitely don't skimp. The bok chow had 8 bundles. When you go to the Asian market, there's a dozen to a bag. The bok chow was cooked well and went well with the steak and fish. The poutine was just okay but I'm a poutine novice.  The water show runs every 30 minutes which is perfect to take a break in between bites because it is a lot of food. Did I mention that the water shows are very \"artistic\". I like all the technology used.  Dessert was yummy! I ordered the creme Brule which was made with lychee and passion fruit and topped with mamgo. Lychee is my favorite. You can taste the lychee in the dessert and the mango pieces were a little tart so it was a perfect compliment. Because it was also my birthday, they gave us a small red velvet cupcake. It really was a perfect size to follow our filling dinner.  Before we left, the second waiter who delivered the desserts offered to take our picture. Super sweet, and they made it a point to refer to us as Mr and Mrs Santiago, even upon leaving, wishing us a good night and one last happy birthday and anniversary.  Mahalo to all the Lakeside staff for taking the time to make this a beautiful evening for my husband and I.",

Our dinner started at 8:30pm and we were seated near the outside view of the waterfall/light show.  As I walked past the other tables, the server had brought out a live lobster on a tray to show other guests.  Too bad I am not a fan of lobster!  This restaurant doesn't offer a tasting menu.  Everything is a la carte.  The average price for each dish is around $40 which I find it being very reasonable for its location and ambience.  We ordered couple appetizers and four entrees.   The only dish I thought was average was their foie grais.   The seafood dishes were all above average.  Even the bread basket they served was pretty good.    My favorite dish was the lobster risotto.  The shrimps, scallops and fish dishes were good but I would order their lobster risotto next time.  And yes, this is one of those restaurants I would dine over and over again when I'm in Vegas.    We looked over the dessert menu after our dinner and noticed they did not serve coffee ice cream.  The waiter tried to best to find that flavor ice cream by calling the restaurant next door since the pastry chef works at both restaurants.  We suggested a shot of espresso and a scoop of their vanilla ice cream instead.  Affogato style!  He was able to make that magic happen and we happily ate this amazing ice cream that was made from scratch by their own chef.   Next time I am ordering my own!   The espresso was from illy which made the overall dessert taste that much better!     Lobster risotto and Affogato for dessert.  That's all I can say about this place that makes them 4 stars!",

It's definitely a no-brainer that you need to call early and make a reservation especially on a popular dining night. Which is basically any night in Las Vegas. Ask to be seated by the lake so that you can enjoy the show and the view of the lake. I would suggest making a reservation around six - 6:30 PM, as that way you get to experience the Lakeside view during the day and night. I think, if I remember correctly, the shows that are done on the lake, start around seven or 730 and performed each half hour there after. The service is wonderful, very classy and intelligent wait staff accompanied by a sommelier to help make your liquor & wine choice. The food itself is delicious, no question about it. Definitely pricey. Save up your pennies for this one. At least, know that the experience will be worthwhile. Steve Wynn knows how to throw party! Also, this is a great restaurant for a special occasion as not only is the service, food, and cocktails incredible, but the environment is amazing.",

The atmosphere is amazing and the shows are fun. We were there during the rodeo and they had the frog singing Friends in Low Places. Super cute. Great place for a quiet dinner (by Vegas standards!) with friends or a partner. You definitely feel like you're not in Vegas!  We started with wine and they did an excellent job recommending one that fit not only our taste but our budget as well.   Now on to the food... We ordered a little of everything. The tuna tartar, split a piece of fish with the citrus dressing, creamed spinach, and lobster risotto finish. Everything was on point. The fish was perfectly cooked and quite honestly, I'm glad we split. The portion was actually bigger than expected. Perfect for two with the sides and app. The lobster risotto was creamy and had large chucks of lobster meat. The spinach was also super creamy and seasoned perfectly. The tuna app was also a substantial size and had a nice kick to it.   For dessert we had the creme brulee. It was the perfect amount of sweetness and had a coffee flavor to it. Different twist, for sure!  Service was superb as well, stopping by to check in but also giving enough space to feel comfortable and not rushed.",

Like every Wynn/Encore restaurant, with the exception of Country Club Steak, it was exceptionally over priced and had luke warm service for the money.  We had a large group and several servers and they were functional but with little personality or passion.  Maybe they are trained to serve stoic people from other places, but this is Vegas so let's at least have some energy.  I had the filet which was solid but no comparison to STK, Delmonicos or Del Frisco.  The atmosphere was much flatter than I expected for a Friday night.  We brought a fun group with the intention on being in the middle of some action.  The show that goes on over the water was a bit disappointing.  The upside was it was so quiet, it felt like we had a private dining room.  Overall very functional food and a pretty venue, but you can do better within Wynn at Country Club Steak and the other venues noted above.",

I think my favorite part of the meal was the warm pretzel bread that was served with the dinner rolls, I know its not high-end, but it was damn tasty. We had an appetizer and two entrees and were very satisfied with everything. The cocktails were delicious and refilled promptly.  Finally, make sure you don't miss the singing frog show. I love that freaking frog.",

Its situated by the lake at the Wynn hotel which was nothing to get really excited about. My husband had the lobster with drawn butter which was excellent. However the rest of the dishes we ordered were mediocre.  The steaks were ok. I had the pomfret or monchong. The fish was dry and needed more sauce.",

Kingncrab guac was ok but more like crab and and avocado not guacamole and no chips.   My steak was ok but i ate maybe half as it was nothing special.  Lobster poutine was very bad call to use mozzarella as it was more like congealed wood glue rendering the dish one solid piece. Maybe a few pieces of lobster were free but almost impossible to eat/serve without a knife.   Creamed truffle spinach was quite good     I am so disappointed i want my money back and hope i dont get sick.",

DJ music also can be heard in dining room. Nice modern dining area setting in white and bright citrus orange hues of leather chairs and shiny resin tables. Mirrors to catch reflections of everyone and anything. Cocktails can be acquired from a bar. Service was good. American menu. Vegetarian menu. Seafood and Steaks in menu. Liked the Strip Steak Sandwich that's moist with heap of juicy caramelized onions and truffled Robiola cheese which made it even taste marvelous with every bite. Large portioned. For the love of chocolate or sweets, there's a sweet cart named Desire that is desirable for sweet cravings in bite-sized dessert portions in chocolate, nuts, fruits and with creamy fillings. Listening to it called sounded like American playwright Tennesee Williams' 1948 Pulitzer Prize Drama \"Street Car Named Desire\". If not for each meal charges being on the moderate to upper values, this would be a regular dining spot. For occasional fine dining, this may well be fine restaurant for creative American food.",

Proved her copy of reservation from Edee concierge at Ceasars she told us we had cancelled them.  What?  She told us to wait in bar we did for over 45 minutes.  We tried and tried order drinks (only 10 people at bar @ that time we were totally ignored) finally got some after 15 minutes sitting at bar no less When she came to get us hesitantly put our drinks on her tray ... Not sure why she did it for the three other couples she sat before usnot sure why she apparently looked down on us  Fortunately the show La Rev prior to dinner awesome and the food and our waiter fabulous  Would have given a 5 star but hostess sets the tone and she needs to realize whether it's the first or 100th customer of the night be nice, smile, believe your customer and don't stereotype or make them feel like liars when they have proof BTW I tried to tell her that it was my husbands birthday.

    "text": "Expected more for the price.  Our 2 person meal cost more than $300 with one glass of good wine.  Adequate sized portions but still too pricey.  Starters: Ahi poke - tasty with jalapenos Soft shell crab, fried with a spicy sauce - just ok (reminded me of an Outback bloomin' onion)  Salad (most disappointing course of the evening) - should have gotten the lobster bisque.  The heirloom tomato salad was icky (soggy cut up big chunks of tomatoes and bits of mozzarella and they forgot the pistachios and the flavor; when I asked the server about them, he looked confused.  Shouldn't you know the dishes?  This salad was definitely not worth $20!  Wish I could give this dish negative stars. (Maybe I've been spoiled from eating the most amazing heirloom salad at Jaleo in Wash, DC.  Now that's how it should be done!)  Entrees: Dover sole - covered in dry, crusty bread crumbs, couldn't even taste the fish, and the broccolinis were mostly hard stem pieces.  Hope all their other fish dishes aren't as disappointing. Lobster risotto saved the day - very well done Sides - crab mac&cheese and asparagus were good but pricey at $14-$16  Dessert: Absolutely the highlight of the meal and saved it from being totally mediocre. Get the Strawberry Napoleon, but only if you like basil.  Who knew ice cream could be basil flavored?  Surprising and delightful combination of flavors.  The service was very good and brought the star rating up.  I read some of the other reviews, but we found our waiter to be very attentive and, unlike the server, he knew everything about the menu.  Wish he had turned me off the dover sole, though.  He was the one who recommended the Strawberry Napoleon, so all is forgiven.  We never had to ask for drink refills and plates were cleared without our even noticing.  The manager took the time to come speak with us and that was nice and unexpected.",

Why I was seated next to the kitchen without a view of the waterfall when the restaurant wasn't full as I'll never know how wait staff make those decisions since we were very well dressed. The waiter was not very interested in making it a nice night for us either. At least the Sommelier was interested enough to show some attention. My steak was good but a little too charred on the outside. I can't remember the rest of the food so I guess it would be considered unremarkable.  The restaurant lighting is also kind of funny, it's not dark or light...just something in the middle which gave you a weird feeling. I'll never come back.",

After several days and countless hours of trying to secure a reservation at this restaurant that was recommended by a friend, I was told that they could not seat us all at the same table-no problem and completely understandable, we are a large group. And I will have to have a preset menu to select from due to group size- no problem we will make due with that, we are a pretty easy going group. And I will have to sign a contract and put a 50% deposit down to hold the reservation- a little extreme, but again, no problem. The problem came when after all of this was said and done and HOURS spent trying to secure the reservation I was told that only 4 credit cards could be used to pay the entire tab.  Really, I am not a corporation we are jsut a group of people wanting to have dinner together. Well that is several hours of my life that I will not get back. I will NOT be recommending this establishment to anyone that may have a large group to coordinate.  thanks for nothing, Lakeside. We took our business else where...",

I had a very pleasant experience here with a large party of friends. Our servers were all super nice, and I've always loved the ambiance and location, especially getting to overlook the colorful fountain show that's outside.   We started off with a 2000 Brunello Di Montalcino, which was one of the surprisingly tastier red wines that I've had. Appetizer wise, their ahi tuna delicious! It was very addicting as well. Once u stop, u just couldn't stop! I ordered the filet mignon with bone marrow as my entree, which was very good, but I must say that the LAMB was THE BEST. If you like meat and lamb, definitely order that! It was just so flavorful and tasty, just melted in ur mouth! But the BEST thing that's not on the menu has got to the the TRUFFLE MAC N CHEESE! it is by the far the BEST mac n cheese that i have EVER had! seriously...order it and you WON'T regret! I would go back to this place anyday just to get the truffle mac n cheese, even to go!   Once you're done with dinner, they roll out the dessert cart which totally sparkled in my eyes. There were a lot of choices and being a dessert fanatic, it was hard to choose. We finally decided on the chocolate covered caramel apples with nuts, a peanut butter cappuccino mousse (SO DELICIOUS omg), and a tirimisu in a cup. They were all very yummy and I definitely wanted to finish it all if only my stomach allowed.   Overall, I really enjoyed my experience here and would definitely come back again!",

The wedding was almost two weeks ago and that is how long I've been thinking about the meal I ate here. If you are looking for shrimp large enough to put a saddle on and ride, this is your place. I am still dreaming of the amazing steak and lobster tail I had- the steak had a delicious, salty crust which surrounded tender and flavorful meat. I am not usually a steak eater but I almost turned into Spalding from \"Caddyshack\" asking the table \"Are you going to eat your fat?\" The lobster was perfectly cooked and buttery and the whole she-bang was put on a tomato sauce that tasted like the most intense, flavorful marinara you have ever had. I had one of the truffles from the dessert menu and it was this interesting combination of rich chocolate and salt- sounds weird but if you are like me and love sweet/salty, this is your jam. One cool part of the meal is the Lake of Dreams show that occurs every 30 minutes. It was weird and quirky and the highlight of my kids' dinner. Try to sit outside if you can so you can really get the full effect.   I hate to fly, but I'd gladly hop on a plane to get another steak from Lakeside.",

    "text": "My husband and I went here last night for dinner and I booked the restaurant ONLY because it had outdoor seating by the Wynn lake. I made the reservations on OpenTable over a week beforehand. When we got there we were told that an outside seat would be an hour wait...immediately I was annoyed because this is the reason I made reservations ahead of time and I requested a seat outside. I've worked in the restaurant business...if you can't guarantee outdoor seating then make a note of that on reservations sites etc. OR don't overbook your patio. If wait had been 15-30 minutes I would have been understanding and had gone to the bar to wait...but an hour wait is ridiculous...poor planning in my opinion.  Dinner was pretty good. My husband and I ordered a bottle of wine and got a dozen oysters to start. Usually at restaurants they will explain where the oysters are from etc. at a seafood restaurant I would expect that an more...nope...nothing. If I'm paying $40 for oysters I'd like to know a little bit about them and since I noticed we got 2 different kinds it would have been nice to have know the difference between the two. I guess I'll ask next time.  Next, my husband and I ordered the specialty...whole lobster from their 4 different choices offered. They bring live lobsters to your table beforehand and explain where each one is from and the price per pound. My husband got the Scottish Blue ($160ish total for 2.5lbs) and I went with the classic Maine ($100 2.5lbs). We opted for the chili rub. Food arrived beautifully prepared. Butter came on a warming dish but flame underneath was not lit...so butter got cold quickly.   My husband's lobster was perfect but mine had a little surprise waiting. I started with the tail and once I started cutting into it there was a massive amount of slimey black/dark green ooze coated on the inside of the tail. The lighting was dim so I kind of ate the parts that weren't covered and finished off the claw meat. I then asked the server what the black/green slime was and he said it was \"roe\" meaning lobster eggs. My lobster was pregnant. He told me I was lucky that I got a lobster with roe...however, it's not what I ordered and was expecting...plus it's slimey and not pretty to look at and there was so much it made it so unappetizing. The server also said one time they had a live lobster that they picked up that had been oozing roe just before cooking. He explained that it was apparently illegal for it to be sold in that condition...I'm assuming for ecological reasons but then why would you still serve that? He also said I got a lot of it...  I was looking forward to dessert after dinner but because my lobster was not appealing at all I lost my appetite. I'm a huge fan of cavier but because lobster roe is slimey and black and there were huge gobs of it...it was not something I found to be a delicacy and I did not feel \"lucky\" at all.  I didn't have the heart to tell them I didn't like it because I ate the claw meat and as much of the tail as I could muster despite some chewiness. My husband looked up online regarding the situation and found different reviews regarding lobster roe being a delicacy and other reviews explained that usually the lobster should not be served if roe is found inside.   I felt really disappointed with our $500 meal. Won't be going back. If you get lobster with roe make sure you put all your money on black then...you're lucky I guess...",

    "text": "Steve Wynn is a radical vegan these days, so all his restaurants feature vegan options. I am most definitely NOT a vegan...but I like to try new stuff, so a friend took me out for a little sampling one night. We started with appetizers at SW steakhouse (see my other review), and then walked across the hall for dinner here.  Food-wise, the vegan menu was about the same as at SW. We ordered the \"clam\" chowder, which was ASTONISHINGLY like real clam chowder -- they use chopped oyster mushrooms to give that rubbery clam mouthfeel you know and love, and I swear even the crustiest old sea dog out of Nantucket wouldn't know the difference.  For entrees, we had the \"crab\" cakes and the \"fried chicken,\" which was made from this weird protein substitute called Gardein. Whatever it is -- it is AWESOME! Tastes like chicken, feels like chicken, looks like chicken...who knows what the hell it REALLY is (knowing the capitalist kingpin proletariat-grinders who frequent the Wynn, probably Soylent Green).  The waiter (actually, now that I think about it, it was the sommelier...the waiter wasn't too engaging)  was very attentive to our desire to try vegan stuff, so he had them send us a vegan bread basket, with vegan butter (more soylent green). It was great! We also had some wine, and then strayed from the vegan shtick for dessert, and ordered a few fun fruity little things that were fantastic.  Atmosphere-wise, I appreciate the fact that this restaurant is half open-air, on a sort of patio overlooking one of the fake lakes at the Wynn, facing a giant waterfall. Every 20-30 minutes or so, a cheesy 5-minute \"show\" takes place on the waterfall: two balls of colored light dance around, cooing and making weird sex noises until a little baby ball pops out. Weird! Another show features two giant steampunk-esque mechanical flowers that bloom and sort of flirt with each other in a creepy flowery way. Another mini-show is a weird avant-garde 80s pop-art extravaganza set to that lame-ass 80s song \"Oh Yeah\" by Yello. YOU know the one. And the last vignette (or whatever the hell you want to call this weird/lame-ass shit) is this SUPER-cheesy giant frog in a UBER-corny black Stetson who sings Garth Brooks's \"I've Got Friends in Low Places.\"   W..............T.....................F!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I know Steve Wynn is a vegan.....but maybe he should lay off those MUSHROOMS a little...ya know?!?!?!?!!!!!!",

    "text": "Very pleased that they honored our request for a table near the windows with a view of the Lake of Dreams, and that they got us out in time for our show.  It's a steak and seafood place.  Wine by the glass is surprisingly reasonable, though their bottle start a little high.  They have an interesting bottled beer list, as well as some number of \"normal\" choices for those so inclined.  The bread basket was very good.  We ordered the octopus app - correctly cooked, though a relatively small serving with some salt bombs.  The foie appetizer arrived nicely seared, though the biscuit it was served with was both a little large for the portion and somewhat dry.  The appetizer assortment was nicely plated, though it took a while to show up, and contained some cool squid on sticks, pieces of wagyu, whole shrimp, little bowls of scallop, four rather strongly fishy siu mai and a small serving of tuna tartare with what appeared to be trout roe.  A shrimp entree in tomato sauce contained four large, if slightly over-firm shrimp.  The scallop entree likewise had four large scallops, but was overly salty.  Salmon arrived nicely moist for being ordered medium-well, on a shallow bed of rice, and the Blackened Swordfish was a generous portion.  They offer a \"Dessert Cart\" where you can choose from some number of options, though the cart itself appears to be more theoretical than actual.  At $18 for three small items to share, it was a better value than many other things on the menu.  I wouldn't say that anything we had here was amazing or done to a notably high standard, but the location is excellent, the food decent and the service workable.",

She really helped me get everything together and I could not have done it without her.    We chose this location based on a couple of things.   1.  SW would not accommodate a party our size  2. We have eaten here before and liked the food, although the service left something to be desired 3. It's a beautiful space in a beautiful hotel   The menu we chose was their priciest at $150.00 pp.  Mostly everything was great but there were some misses.  Our menu consisted of...   *Antipasto including iberico ham, manchego cheese, marinated olives & bread -  this was a hit.  everything was delicious  *Black Truffle Arancini -  Delicious and they went fast  *Whipped garlic feta cheese with mushrooms and bread - Could have skipped it  Shellfish Platters - made up of the largest shrimp I have ever seen, lobster tails, oysters and Alaskan king crab legs.  These were awesome.  everything tasted fresh and great.  Nice portion for everyone at our table  Salad Course was good, tomatoes, garbanzo beans, peppers, manchego   King Crab Risotto -  This dish was very rich and very tasty.  the risotto was perfectly cooked.  Our entrees consisted of  Dover Sole - my guests who ordered this said it was OK and wished they got something else.  It was not prepared properly  Filet and Lobster tail -  the filet was perfectly cooked as were the lobster tales but the tales were tiny.  I mean baby lobster tiny.  Still very good though.   Bone in NY Strip - The steak itself was very good, however, our guests did not get a choice on temperature.  So most were very rare.  I know that this is typical for most large parties but still..   For dessert we had an assortment brought to each table.  Nothing was really a stand out unfortunately.    The service for the most part was great, the beginning of the meal felt very rushed to me.  I'm not sure anyone else noticed but overall it was a fantastic meal.  I will definitely return.",

    "text": "\"Wine-ing!\" We were a party of 8 for dinner at Lakeside. I ordered the identical 2011 bottle of Spanish red ($86) that I previously enjoyed at a different restaurant the night before. They inadvertently brought the 2013 (which was noticeably inferior). After a few sips, I called the waiter over and said I thought the wine list said 2011 not 2013. He checked and said they gave us the wrong bottle and can collect the wine, dispose of it and give us the 2011. I didn't want them to just throw it away an acceptable but clearly inferior year, so I kept the 2013 and ordered a 2011 when that was finished. In retrospect, I thought they could have comped the wine and given us another bottle (which I subsequently ordered and paid for). As the evening progressed,  I called the sommelier over and asked for them to comp the bottle; but he said their \"policy\" didn't permit it. Apparently Vegas has policies! He said they would refill the bottle and return it to the vendor for credit. First they said they would throw it away and then they later said they would return it for credit - a bit unethical, wouldn't you say - or is that their policy as well. The bill was $1200 so an $86 bottle it should have been no biggie to comp when the bottle retails for $23. For a classy upscale restaurant, they didn't show a lot of class. Won't go back and drop $1200 on a dinner there. I'm sure other restaurants in the Wynn / Encore would welcome our reservation. This story didn't stay in Vegas!",

I wasn't sure how expensive this place was, so when I saw the prices I had some sticker shock!      I rolled with it and picked the Prime Rib.  It was 20 ounces of pure DELIGHT!  I had it cooked medium rare and it came out perfect. It had some mushrooms on it and it was the best rib eye I've ever had.  The prime rub is GRASS FED.   We also had the Salmon and Far Qua.  Service was spectacular.  This was real fine dining. My Cherry Pepsi was always full, except for 10 mins when a large group next to us sat down.   The waiter was very nice and friendly. No stick up anyone's behind here!  We got to sit next to the window which is next to a lake that plays a unique little 3-5 minute show every 20 minutes.  Had a fun time here for sure.  This place and its ambiance is great for a romantic evening with a significant other.  Highly recommended for sure!    The best prime rib I ever had here.  I will be back.",

All 4 plates had to be sent back to the kitchen: 1 was undercooked and 3 were lukewarm. After all 4 have been brought back to us again, 1 of those new 4 turned out to be undercooked. Again! Mine seemed fine, so I ate it. The restaurant tried to make it up to us, so they brought us free desserts, which tasted very good. About an hour and a half after the meal I started having a stomachache. No need for further details, but the rest of the night - till 4 am was very unpleasant for me. We have not heard back from the customers, so my only hope is that, since my fish was cooked differently (mine was with Japanese vegetables, while all of theirs were with citrus), I was the only one at our table to get food poisoning.",

I had the wellington, mushroom chowder, and vegan carrot cake.  The wellington was so flaky and light.  In my opinion, there was a little too much spinach.  The asparagus was crisp but well done.  The mushroom chowder was amazing.  It was creamy.  To me, it tasted more like potato leek soup.  I could not believe that the carrot cake was vegan.  It was moist and delicious.  The frosting was not too sweet or heavy.  The wait staff was attentive but not overbearing.  They had excellent recommendations.",

For entrees, the BF got the filet mignon, lobster, and king crab Mac n cheese, which was enough to give him the \"sea sweats.\" I got the pomfret with the Mediterranean treatment - per Chas' recommendation - and we both got Pinot Grigio.

This is a very high end, luxurious restaurant with amazing service and even more amazing food.  We ordered the larger Rib-eye steak, Ceasar salad, a few appetizers and fries.  The steak was cooked to perfection, and was like butter.  The salad was standard, but you could tell was made with fresh ingredients and the sides were all perfect.  The tiramisu souffle was very unique and equally amazing.  For my birthday, they brought over a tiny cake -like the size of a dollar coin - with a candle, and that tiny cake was even more delicious than the souffle. The wait staff are so kind, knowledgable and they genuinely care that you like the food the drinks.  I love that everyone is dressed up and really makes the dining experience memorable.  I personally don't like going to a high-end restaurant and seeing people in shorts and flip-flops - so they mandatory attire requirement is really something I appreciate.  I highly recommend this restaurant for dinner and I can't wait to return.",

    "text": "This was a disappointing experience. We came to celebrate multiple birthdays as we were in town together. I had a reservation months in advance and requested a table by the water but somehow we still could not get this. The hostess was friendly enough and gave us the best table available which still had a decent view. The first server we had did not really explain the menu and seemed put off by my questions about the lobster options. We were sharing some appetizers and trying to decide whether to get it to all come out at once or appetizers first or a combination and he offered no advice except silence. We placed orders and he was to come back to take the wine order but I sat there for 10 minutes with the wine list open and no service. I ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio and they poured this from the bottom of an open bottle and this tasted like it sat overnight or for out for too long. The server had to change shifts and I had to request another glass of wine. Our appetizers arrived and there no serving spoons provided to share and we had to request these. During the appetizers we still had not received bread and we had to request. The mains arrived as well as my lobster order but no butter was provided. I had to ask again and they brought out the 3 different butters but these were not heated in advance so I had a lobster entree ready to eat but cold drawn butter. Many restaurants get the table ready and start heating up the butter well in advance. On eating the lobster it was undercooked and I had to request assistance again to cook it a little more. When It came back there was the same issue and for the first time ever I did not finish lobster on my plate. The whole evening was a series of unnecessary requests repeatedly which was not enjoyable. There is a bizarre light and music show lakeside which did not go well with the restaurant and intended ambience. Washrooms are nice. Overall nicely decorated restaurant with promising menu that fails to deliver due to various kitchen issues and mediocre service. The amount of money we spent was not worth it. There are plenty of high end restaurants in hotels on the strip that would offer better food and service. Will not return again.",

The crap cake was crisp and delicious the sauce added a kick but a good kick in the mouth. Yummm. I wasn't too found of the ricotta to be honest. I felt like they just stuffed it with ricotta and called it a day with tomato sauce on the side. But I did end up using the tomato sauce to dip my bread with it though. That was my entree.   I was doing just fine til a waiter walks around carrying live LOBSTERS in pushing cart. Selling it!!! Like really?! You couldn't have it on the menu? Why walk around, having a live show to see what lobster you're going to slaughter for dinner. It's not very vegan if I must say so myself.  Over all. It was a great dinner. I would come back.

If you're dining in the winter months, it starts closer to 7:00pm. Be sure to confirm with the person booking your reservation if this is something that you really want to see.   We chose Lakeside for our 11-year wedding anniversary dinner and sat outside to enjoy the amazing weather, tropical sights, and waterfall sounds. So you can imagine my surprise when a waft of cigarette smoke came billowing over me head. Needless to say, I was less than thrilled. Shockingly, you're allowed to smoke outdoors here, even though other patrons are a mere inches away from you, trying to enjoy a gourmet meal. (It's 2016 people, why are you still smoking?) Anywho, we asked to be relocated and they happily did so, immediately. I was not about to let my filet taste like an ash tray. Poison your own body if you want to, but to force it upon my anniversary dinner is quite another story.   Our food was prepared to perfection and the whipped potatoes literally melt in your mouth. The strawberry martini was refreshingly delicious. My husbands Moscow mule was good, but he was disappointed that such a fine establishment would not have copper mugs, maybe that's something they can get in the future (hint, hint).",

We left our friends for a couple of hours and came to have dinner at Lakeside since a several of his colleagues recommend we come try it. We started off with the king crab and avocado - it was whatever. The crab wasn't fresh and the dish was pretty bland. We both had the ribeye and it was okay, again kind of bland. We both ordered our steak medium and it was prepared very well. The steak was huge I barely got through half of mine. We sat outside the ambiance was really nice and the service was outstanding. I have to rate it three stars though, being in Vegas where you're surrounded by superb restaurants I guess I expected more. Also being from Los Angeles we have incredible steakhouses so I guess I didn't really think Lakeside was better than anything I've had here in LA.",

    "text": "Lakeside is SW's neighbor on the lake of dreams. A great place to go when the weather is nice and you can sit outside overlooking the \"lake\" and it's entertainment offerings.  It's a dramatic setting with excellent food and service to match. Lakeside often gets overlooked within Wynn's portfolio of fine dining choices including SW, Wing Lei, Mizumi and Costa di Mare... all excellent... But Lakeside is the perfect balance between SW and Costa di Mare offering great steaks and freshly caught expedited Hawaiian fish in an upscale but still casual setting.  This is the perfect place for party that can't commit to either a full steak or seafood experience. The Hawaiian fish offering is the real deal and usually boasts Mahi Mahi, Mongchong and others with a variety of preparations.  Our 7 person party left stuffed with smiles on our faces. I had the veal ravioli and Dover Sole and thought the chef nailed both dishes. Yum yum.",

Had to wait and wait to get the servers attention that we are ready to order. Had questions about some items, which the server wasn't sure of. Very impersonal service. Only saving grace was the water shows every 15 mins .. Not recommend or going back",

We ordered the seafood tower, wine and the ribeye steaks. The food was expensive but delicious! The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star review is I ordered my steak medium rare and it came out medium to medium/well. They did get me another piece of prime rib but by the time I received it my husband was done with his so we ate separately. We didn't order dessert but they brought us out a lovely complimentary dessert. Service was fantastic. Our bill came to $400....not cheap but for a special occasion worth every cent.",

Fresh seafood and quality products. Exciting light show over the gargantuan water display. Intimate and comfortable seating. Fabulous food.   Varietal bread basket with artisanal butter. Outrageously yummy ceasar and house cobb salads. BEST shrimp cocktail. Infamously prepared bone-in rib eye and filet mignon. The beef is marinated, well seasoned and cooked to perfection. Both cuts were very juicy and tender. I prefer the bone-in rib eye. High quality lobster plates prepared your way. No tiny pieces either. Only large lump lobster in YA MOUTH!! My favorite side dish was the yukon gold mashers with lobster. It was unexpectedly delightful and decadent. It arrived pipping hot in a little cast iron pot with a lobster claw on top. Boooyaahhh!  Good wine and comprehensive wine list. Abundant and artistic desserts. Cotton candy with real gold is a must.   So pleased to have shared such a magical meal and perfect bottle of Pinot with my two besties on my bachelorette weekend.",

The serving sizes are substantial, the food is solid (grilled saffron octopus with very spicy chorizo is good if on the edge of too spicy, the lobster risotto is rich, creamy, and bordering on too large...a great split dish maybe?, and the other Hawaiian fish are solid and simply prepared.  The bourbon souffle is light yet rich. Be careful not to fill up too much on the amazing breads too. Wine by the glass choices were sufficient and reasonably priced.   The service is fantastic. Very accommodating and not haughty.   Expect to pay about $360 for 2 people (appetizers, entree's, two glasses of wine each, splitting a desert).",

I wanted to order the 20-ounce Chili Rubbed Rib-eye and King Crab plate but they ran out of the rib-eye so they gave me a 16-ounce New York strip steak but it did not look like 16-ounces. Mind you, it was only 7pm, how do you run out of steaks 2.5 hours after opening?! My portions were smaller than what I was expected, was not worth $82.",

The filet was delicious , but all this talk about kobe beef being sooo much better and bla bla bla .. Eeeh again it was a steak. The mac and cheese was terrible. Id say almost not edible.

Lobster cooked right,  Arborio creamy yet with a \"bite\"  - very good;  Foie - Seared rare, served with sweet brioche, delicious. Superbly fresh;  Crab salad with guacamole - very nice.  Guac was perfectly spiced and seasoned.  Crab was just a tad over-dressed, but very good nonetheless;  Halibut - Delicious, cooked right and moist inside (not an easy feat with this fish)  Pasta had some green peas inside - more interesting, it had a few green pea shoots that gave the pasta an interestingly pleasing taste;  Miniature Desserts: Tres leches, cheese cake, and molten chocolate cake.  Other than being not quite miniature, each dessert was  very good.  The last one listed was least interesting (prepared in a cup and a touch too sweet).  The Leches and Cheese cake were superb  Overall, - great-to-very good food and service, - good value ##",

But if you really want a \"Wow\" this is definitely it. My dinner consisted of crab cakes, scallops, asparagus, cake for dessert and all of it was impeccably prepared and served.  Great place to celebrate an occasion or for a romantic meal. The multimedia shows in the waterfall are somewhat bizarre but entertaining. After dinner stroll upstairs to the balcony bar to just sit and look at the waterfall.",

We had a beautiful view with the garden wall that is a quite a show but not to the point it takes away your interaction with your spouse. Just perfect! We had one the best waiter we ever had in Las Vegas. He understood our love for wine pairing and surprised us with very creative wine pairings with our foods. It was truly a great experience. Food, well it was just amazing! I had the vegan menu and what a menu it was! My husband had the other menu and was as happy as I was. He ate a lot of my Wellington and was very impressed. When I looked around, I was pleasantly surprised to see that many diners had vegan menus in their hands! This was an expensive dinner but worth the splurge! At Wynn there are a lot of high end restaurants and Lakeside might be my new favorite! I always look at quality/price/service/taste/ambiance to grade a restaurant; and Unfortunately my least favorite is Mizumi!",

It was either the lowest quality rib eye ever or, and this is what I told them, a sirloin being passed off as a rib eye. Again, when I pointed this out I was told it was indeed a rib eye. I didn't buy it which means I didn't buy it. They did take the steak off the bill which is to their credit. We should have mentioned how dry my wife's moonfish was but at that point we just wanted to get on with our evening. I love the Wynn. It's the best on the strip but this place is not up to Mr. Wynn's standards.",

    "text": "I feel like Lakeside Grill did not quite rise to the occasion of such a beautiful and tranquil location near Wynn's manmade lake.  We came here for a nice anniversary dinner with no expectations.  Service was sub-par and food was just average for the amount of money that we dropped.  Food:  The sides... - Lobster Macaroni and Cheese - cheesy and delicious, but this was just the side. - Crab Fried Rice - The wok flavor was there.  The slight kick of curry was just enough to create a happy party on my tongue, but the rice was slightly dry.  The main dishes.... - Smoked Ribs - They were cold and not fall of the bone tender.  I couldn't make myself eat more than two and just give up.  Couldn't bare to waste precious calories on non-delicious food. - Prime Rib - It's hard to compare to Lawry's Prime Rib's glorious meat, and Lakeside's prime rib certainly was NOT the juiciest and most tender.  My man even complained about the meat and the sauces, and he usually enjoys EVERYTHING.  Service: Perhaps it was an off night and they're point of sale computers were acting up, but service was spotty.  It was difficult to flag anyone down, and if we could get someone's attention, they left as quickly as they came.  In the end, it took 45 minutes to get the check due to the POS system glitches, and we were glad to just get out of there  Conclusion:  $240 for the bill of food and drinks, and we left disappointed with the caliber of food.  Maybe we should have went over to SW Steakhouse instead?",

The portions are huge and the food is generally very good. I ordered a prime rib that was the thickest I had ever seen while dining out.  I had an add-on of scallops that were fantastic, but 2 scallops cost me an additional $20.  The bread is very good, especially a pretzel type that s served in a basket. The staff was very attentive and met our needs efficiently.  Despite the heat, we sat outside on the waters edge. Lakeside is good for a special occasion or romantic dinner, but be prepared to cash in a lot of chips to pay for it.",

    "text": "Dining at Lakeside is an EXPERIENCE!  All in all, although it is pricey, you will definitely get what you pay for thanks to the deliciously decadent food, attentive service and incredible ambiance - indoors or out, it is a nice treat to have the gorgeous view overlooking the Lake of Dreams and being able to view the show.  Set to various types of music, the show is every 30 minutes and sometimes romantic, sometimes lighthearted and fun (even for kids).    We \"conservatively\" ordered what turned out to still be a ton of food & drinks between 7 of us and after gratuity, I believe the final bill was just under $800.  As our company was footing the bill, nobody ordered anything very extravagant (ie. Caviar for $165 or Rock Lobsters at $95 per pound), but we totally had many reasonable options to choose from at fair prices for the quality and substantial amount of food.  One coworker is Vegan and was thrilled with not only her Old Bay \"Crab Cake\" dish, but the fact that ALL Wynn restaurants feature Vegan menu options.  A few of us ordered and enjoyed the Alaskan halibut and could not even come close to finishing it due to the heaviness of the starters and shared side dishes that we ordered for the table.  Some people ordered salads while some of us shared the oh-so-yummy Crab Guacamole.  We also ordered Asparagus with Balsamic Cream, Alaskan Crab Mac & Cheese (rich & creamy is an understatement) and Harissa Spiced French Fries (which virtually went untouched, not for lack of flavor, but for lack of space in our bellies).  So let me tell you what I would order NEXT time (cause yes, I will return!):  One coworker ordered the Mesquite Smoked Prime Rib and HOLY COW...it was amazing!!  Like, SO good that he gave each of us (except the Vegan) a bite or two and we all had dish envy.  Technically the dish envy started when his cut of beef arrived at the table in a glass chamber to contain the smoke!!  See what I mean about presentation!?!    Needless to say, we did not even entertain looking at the dessert menu.  However, I would be remiss to not mention the amazing cocktail that i had!  If there is a passion fruit flavored drink on a menu anywhere, I go for it and I am so glad I went for this one:  the Fiesta Fatale Margarita!!!  Translation??:  A margarita with Passion Fruit and Sriracha that will knock your socks off!  No, it wasn't spicy (though the side dish of spiced nuts to complement it ARE tasty & spicy), but it is just THAT good!!  Wines by the glass were also very good, but VERY expensive.  Brace yourself for bottle prices, too.  Eek!!  I could almost hear all of us getting in trouble with the Accounting Dept for even THINKING about ordering some of the bottles on that menu.    Regardless, no regrets!!  Dining at Lakeside is as good as it gets!",

That alone deserves some kudos. Ears perked yet?   I think I like the idea of Lakeside: I like the decor, or at least parts of it. I like the prompt and attentive service. I like the simultaneously calming yet high-end ambiance. I like the over-the-top and abstract lakeside show. I like the concept of fresh, lakeside food. But in terms of execution, I can't say that's its all there. Almost, but not quite.   Decor: You will see orange and lots of it. Think ING Direct; it's probably the orange lion and orange ball's safe haven after their direct acquisition merge with Capital One. But it kind of grows on you in a strange, Great Gatsby kind of way. Or am I just reminiscing about ING Direct? Probably a little but of both... I miss you, orange ball! Anywho, the decor is at once mismatched and modern and homey. Think eyebrow-raising mermaid mural with inviting floor lamps and cozy couches, and a heavy dosage of Ancient Greek buffs in the nude. It feels like a page out of West Elm or Z Gallerie, but in a restaurant instead of a home. It's weird, but it kind of works.   Service: The waiter service here is so good and fast and attentive you might be slightly put off. How is that for a contradiction? Every time you leave for even a few minutes at a time, your napkin will be refolded and your plate might be re-angled to be just right. Are you properly creeped out, or strangely attracted? Whatever floats yoyr boat. And to my overly-attentive waiter, I apologize for the fact that I inhale water like a cow and absorb it like a sponge. Nevertheless, it's five-star service.   Ambiance: Quiet place for a business dinner or power lunch? A good choice. What about a romantic dinner for two outside? Excellent as well. I think the ambiance can potentially be both romantic and professional, and Lakeside has this balance down pat. This is probably one of those felt-but-not-seen areas of attraction about the restaurant. You may not realize it at first, but once you do, you appreciate it and fall in love with it.   Show: So weird, yet not so strange in the context of Vegas. It's a recurring show every 30 minutes, with a handful of different \"shows.\" The one I watched included 2 independently existing balls floating on water, interacting with corresponding music, water, and lights. Then, two seconds before the show ended, out popped a baby ball. Guess that is the beauty of conception, in the form of an abstract and therefore \"appropriate\" show. Appropriate for Vegas, I suppose, and strange, to say the least.   Food: Their seafood is incredibly fresh, and options are wide and varied. I was caught off guard when a waiter came by with a tray of lobsters from different places. It was like a scene from an Asian seafood market, misplaced at a super luxe American restaurant. We didn't order too many entrees, for money's sake, but we ordered quite a bit of appetizers and sides. We ordered the salmon entree, lobster macaroni and cheese, king crab and guacamole, lobster risotto, marinated king prawns, lobster poutines, truffles, complimentary fresh bread, and dense chocolate sponge cake with strawberries. My favorite as the lobster macaroni and cheese; immediately, the cheesiness attracted me to it, and the subtle and fresh taste of lobster reeled me in. I also enjoyed the slightly-grainy and unique-tasting vanilla and raspberry sorbets that came with our cake for dessert. The cake was solid as well, as it was both light and dense, and not too sweet. Some dishes, such as the truffle mushrooms, skewed to the salty side. Other than that, I must say their food is good but not jaw-dropping or life-changing in the way I expected it to be. I think the thing about it is that I felt the high quality elements and extremely fresh seafood were slightly cheapened but everyday, commonplace ingredients, such as salsa, guacamole, or kimchi. If I'm eating quality seafood, I need to feel and know and be able to acknowledge that it's in a mind-blowing league of its own. Also, I know that the seafood factor ties their food together, but genre-wise, it still feels like it has some sort of identity crisis. King crab and guacamole dish was Mexican, tuna and kimchi dish was Korean, poutine dish was Canadian, Mac and cheese was American. For such an upscale and swanky restaurant at a five-star hotel, I expect(ed) a much more, dare I say, \"specialized\" dining experience. Not to say the food was not good - not at all; just a few inches short of amazing.   Do you see what I mean? I genuinely and desperately want to love, not just like, Lakeside. But something unspoken about it which I can't quite pinpoint - albeit tiny and insignificant - needs to be tweaked. Just ever so slightly. Almost there, Lakeside, almost there.",

    "text": "Unfortunately I was under the weather when I dined here last month.  I only had their oyster's Rockefeller, lobster bisque. and Cesar salad.  My other dinner mates ordered from filet Mignon to lobster risotto.  Their dishes looked very nicely presented but there was a mix of reviews from the tables as some plates were devoured and others weren't.  We all shared the oysters for the appetizers and it was okay.  Nothing special.  My lobster bisque wasn't spectacular either.   Cesar salad was plain as well.  Not sure if my taste buds were off cause I was sick or the food just failed to impress me.  But non the less, I kind of expected more from such a pricey establishment.  We had patio seating, so we were able to see the little water show that would play every 15 minutes or so.  Very cute.   Service was great, but for the amount we paid for the dinner, it would have been nice to have a complimentary slice of cake for the birthday people then just a tiny lemon cupcake.  I don't think I will be back, but hey, it was worth a try.",

    "text": "We just celebrated our 25th anniversary at the Lakeside restauraunt. Service was top notch. Our waiter Joaquin was incredibly kind and helpful with helping us pick out our food choices.   For our appetizer we had the jumbo shrimp cocktail which consisted of four huge shrimps and cocktail sauce with horseradish shavings on top. Outstanding and enough for two.   Then we shared the house salad which was beautifully prepared and also enough for two. One of the things we loved the most about Lakeside is they serve warm pretzel bread and herb butter with the meal which we both agreed made this place really special. We ordered the wahoo fish blackened for our entrees and it was delicious.   My wife ordered a sangria. She said it was the best sangria she had ever tasted. I took a sip and agreed it was awesome. It had apples in it which was something I hadn't seen before.  For dessert we shared the Godiva brownie mouse cake. It was so light and fluffy with just the right amount of sweetness that we didn't want it to end. The coffee was also excelllent. They also presented us with two mini red velvet cupcakes and \"Happy Anniversary\" written in dark chocolate. A beautiful gesture and delicious as well.   One of the things that makes this restaurant magical is that it sits on the lake at the Wynn with beautiful music playing in the backround. There also three different mini shows on the lake every half hour which feature holographic images and cool music, So you are getting a bit of a show with your dinner as well. The whole night was just spectacular for both of us. It's not cheap but when you want to celebrate a special event like a 25 year anniversary this place should be on the top of your list if you like seafood.",
