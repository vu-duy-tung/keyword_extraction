I am in love with aesthetically pleasing environments and not only is this restaurant beautifully decorated, but the atmosphere is swanky and up-beat with good music.  Now for the food: The food is SO GOOD... I have eaten at this restaurant more than I care to admit and the food is great every time. I highly recommend brunch on Saturdays, the French Toast is amazing! On Tuesdays they have super fresh $1 oysters on the half shell and often times if you check in here on Yelp, you get a free glass of wine. Try all of the dishes. They are each excellent.",

We ordered the meatballs, Caesar salad and the Caprese salad and we both had water to drink. Once the food arrived nobody came to check on us. I tried in vain to make eye contact with anybody walking around but as they walk they just kept their eyes to themselves and never looked around to see if anybody needed anything. I eventually got up and got my own refill of water. Service matters to me in my review because it is all a part of the experience. Now on to the food. The food was good but there was nothing about anything that was great. Even the desert we ordered which was the chocolate mousse cake was good but again nothing spectacular.",

Happy hour.... meatball, great flavor but cold. Rice balls good flavor but cold. Sauce was cold on both dishes.   We told the bartender to let some one know.  Short ribs for dinner,COLD. My husband's chicken picatta was hot because you have to make it fresh.  $10 for a side of Asparagus and it was like the redwood trees in San Francisco.  They were hot as well because they had to make it fresh. Spaghetti squash $9 dollars and cold. My recommendation is that you wait until they are open a few hours then you may have hot food. Bartender was nice but should offer bread at the beginning of the meal not at the end. FOODIE upset  Not the only time this has happened.",

The food, the same food I ordered the first time (brosciutto eggs benedict)Benedict was way too salty. It tasted like whoever made those just duped salt all over the entire dish. The third time, I actually took my sister here for her birthday brunch.. Worst brunch I have had... The service was sub par,  it took us forever to get waited on. Everybody's food came out alright. This time, I ordered the French Toast. TheThe sides of the toasts came out burnt, it was eating a slice of a rock. It was so hard to chew down on the bread, I felt as if I was going to break my teeth. I called the server over to let him know that my French Toast was burnt and overcooked. He explained to me that the sides and edges of the toast is supposed to be crunchy and extra toasted... Okay.... But I'm sure they're not supposed to be burnt.. There's a different between extra toasted and burnt.  Probably will not go back to this place after trying for the third time. I'm sure I can find better brunch places in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Birthday dinner with the folks and I wanted to try Bottiglia in GVR at the District. Pretty casual & bright atmosphere with televisions (great for those who don't want to miss the playoffs). Decent selection of cocktails and wine by the glass. I tried a Fresca Fizz - it was refreshing but a bit watered down with very little fizz. I think the Prosecco might have gotten a bit watered down by the ice or the Prosecco might've been open too long.  We started with a bit of salumi and cheese - the bresaola was really nice, as was the burrata and tasty toast. Don't forget to try the mustardo that's served with the meat & cheese - it's really good! The arancini were cooked perfectly - crispy on the outside with a warm creamy center.  We received a complimentary Caesar salad.  Our waiter Bryan said it was because he noticed there would be a lull in between courses (he got slammed with tables but it didn't deter from his very good service at all).  For my entree I chose the pappardelle bolognese - anything with pancetta has GOT to be good! Pasta was cooked nicely and not overdressed.   Overall I would give the drinks and meal 3.5 stars and with Bryan's service bump it to 4 stars.  BTW, Chef Ben, formerly with Bachi Burger, recently started at Bottiglia (like two days before), so it might be worth it to go back again and see if he's done anything fun with the menu or preparation.",

Michelle, Isaiah and Raul took care of my high-maintenance order and helped expertly with wine selections that hit all the right spots!  I have now made a point to go every week since!  I always feel like I get much more bang for the buck.   So far my favorite is chicken piccata but have had pork chop, ricotta ravioli, house marinara, halibut and every single time it's been awesome.  Risotto is amazing too  Although I've never had room for dessert,  the cocktails to go while I spun some slots are never watered down!",

Thankfully they were able to get us in because they are very busy most especially for Sunday Brunch.   The Ambiance is one of the best in Las Vegas (top 3!) mostly locals would know because the restaurant is inside Green Valley Ranch Station Casino, away from the strip! Thank goodness. The feeling you get when you first walk in is so refreshing. It feels so welcoming, bright, happy, chic, and very classy!   The food is phenomenal. Brunch items are great and not so overwhelming. It's fresh, it's trendy, it's relatable! The French Toast to die for, the hint of citrus makes it different than most. The omelet is delicious and you can create your own, the potatoes that came with it is crispy and taste great. I ordered the panini with fresh mozzarella and eggplant, very good mix and very Italian. Do order the White Sangria, it's on the sweet side if you like that (I do), and their Mimosa! If you have a big group, it is suggested to get the bottle and share it! Cost effective that way I think. The bread pudding is addicting, can't stop eating it. Love their Bagel Lox as well.   Staff is outstanding, very professional, friendly, and attentive. Great job! I wish I remembered our servers name because he is amazing!",

The room is really pretty and the bartenders were nice.  The food was a bit of a let down.  It was good, but nothing special.  It basically tasted like it was typical hotel restaurant quality.  We were hoping for some really interesting flavors or creativity.  We split a chicken picatta which was swimming in butter and a caesar salad, done nice in a big wooden bowl, but not real flavorful.  I'll give it another shot, maybe next time try their pastas.",

The service was excellent, the restaurant had great ambiance and the dishes were reasonably priced. Thank you to our server and Javier for the complimentary dessert and wine as well.

Spoke to the management afterwards-Diane and Mary, both of who were more than pleasant to deal with and took care of us in return for a hiccup in the experience.  The food is always great, and the management made up for the mishap.  It's good to have such a great place close by, and the waiter, Doug, was by far the best waiter we have dealt with in the restaurant.  We went with a good friend, one who is an excellent chef, and not only did he know what he was talking about with the halibut special, but his recommendation was more than \"on par\" with our friend's taste buds.  Bottiglia is a great place, with great staff.  Thumbs up!!",

We were just a party of four, but it took almost two hours for dinner and one dessert.  The server was very kind and apologetic and got the manager to comp one of the meals.  I can't wait to come back.  The place is beautiful!  Happy hour looks fun too- the sangria is served with round ice cubes made of you guessed it.. Sangria.  Then adorned with edible flowers and fruits.  Looked yummy!    I love that you can see the manager / owner walking around checking on things.

I think it's pretty random to have it located at green valley ranch but totally worth the drive. Very spacious and tons of different areas to sit. My friends and I decided to sit at the couches for happy hour. We ordered every single thing on the list which was about 6 choices. We also order 2 pitchers of the sangria. For 4 people, u can get 2 glasses each out of it which is nice. But it was so yummy we had to order another. We has the sangria Rosso. They even have a ball of ice soaked in the wine in your cup for decor. Oysters were yummy. The eggplant spread was okay. The bread basket they give u is good and cute presentation. The arancino were the best out of the menu. It's like a fried cheese ball. The meatballs were tasty. And the Caesar salad was typical. I adore the atmosphere and environment the most. I definitely plan on coming back for a real dinner date and trying out their pastas.",

A very nicely decorated restaurant with a dim lighted tone it was very clean. We were seated right away and our server came to our table very promptly.  I shared the following dishes: Arancini: Six risotto filled balls fried with w bolognese sauce with fontina cheese. Risotto was nice and creamy and the bolognese was a nice touch to the dish.   Papparedelle Bolognese: Thick cut pasta with an overabundant amount of bolognese sauce. I like bolognese and theirs is tasty but the ratio was way off. I could have made more pasta at home to have another portion  Short Rib Cavatelli: another excellent dish with the same issue as above. Way too much sauce for the amount of cavatelli in the dish. I did enjoy the flavors but having pasta over sauced can ruin the dish. I would order this again and tell them lite on the sauce.  Service was excellent. Our server was at our table making sure we were content throughout the dinner. I will definitely be back here to try some of the other menu options. I even received a free dessert for it being my birthday.",

We had one server approach us and offered drinks but we were still too shocked at the hosts awful service and contemplating leaving that we hadn't taken a look at the menu. He gave us a few minutes but were given a new server. One a little more \"ethnic\". Possibly to fit our \"exotic\" look.

    "text": "I came here purely based off of Adam T's recommendation, and my homie did me right.   When I hear that there's a great restaurant inside of local casino I tend to call, \"bullshit,\" but Bottiglia Cucina is the real deal. The vibe of this place is bustling, fun and feels \"young\" not old and stuffy, which is where most local spots tend to falter.   Bottigula offers a full open kitchen/dining room, a large outdoor patio, and decent sized bar and lounge area if you're just looking for a few drinks. We showed up early for our reservations stopped at the bar for a quick drink and light bite before the main meal event. The bar is great, and I could have easily eaten dinner here and been happy. We sampled the charred octopus, and a few martinis and both were perfect. The octopus was very tender and just a touch chewy. Once we sat down, we started with Meatballs and Carbonara Mac n Cheese and shared the Braised Short Rib. I don't have one bad thing to say about any of the food, everything came out fast and hot, which is great because they were busy on this night.   Out of everything we ate, I highly recommend the Charred octopus and Braised Short Rib, order these, and you'll walk out a happy camper. I also keep hearing that this place has an excellent Sunday brunch. Time to brunch so hard.",

    "text": "Greetings Management team,   I decided to have a Birthday Brunch at your beautiful restaurant Bottiglia inside Green Valley Ranch this past Sunday, September 23rd at 11am. Our server was phenomenal (I wish I would have taken his name). The food was great and I loved the environment however I did leave your restaurant with a bad perception of your hostess.   As I was celebrating my birthday, my guests took a couple of gifts. I forgot my gift inside your restaurants and return to retrieve them 10 minutes after my departure.   When I returned to ask for my gift your two hostess (dark and blond hair) stated there were no gifts, please check your cameras on the right side of our table by the entrance. I asked them one more time to please check with the server, the busser was walking by the table and the hosted asked for the gift in which the busser stated \"I gave them to you\". The dark hair hosted then went to the back (I assume the kitchen area) and brought my two gift bags and stated this is what they found but nothing was inside (that is unbelievable!). The dark hair host then pulled my three gift cards from the hostess stand drawer and said \"oh are these yours?\" two gift cards where from Sephora and one from TJ Maxx with  a value of $150.   I am very disappointed with the way your hostess tried to deny the fact I left my gift on accident and the way they acted seemed as they were STEALING my gifts! Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions. There was a camera next to our table which I am sure you can check footage on the occurrence mentioned above.",

Meet up with visitors and mutual friends that suggest check this place out. I was really happy they did because it solid italian food reasonable price not cheap or high end expensive. The Happy Hour is DA BOMB!! Not often do HH but the HH menu not that long but the things they do have are some of the popular items at half the price. I ended up getting the meatballs and the formaggi and salumi. The meatball only get two but expected since HH. The meatballs was cooked perfect, moist, the tomato sauce was tasty, and the cheese brought it all together.  It left me wanting more meatballs that for sure. The formaggi and salumi board had three different meats, diced feta cheese, nice crispy crostini, and apricot fresh jam on the side I think. I thought it was interesting they even had basically charcuterie board on HH menu. All the HH menu compare too full menu is half price. Really no item on the HH menu list that not winner.  For the price its steal of deal. Friend she ordered the caesar salad off HH menu nice side salad size. The HH drink menu not sure because I was not drinking that night but they do have few options.   My entree went with the linguini vongole. It was solid dish. Nothing mind blowing but great traditional white wine butter sauce. Decent amount of fresh clams and nice size portion of pasta. Beverage went with the pomegranate basil limeade. It was refreshing. Nice summer time drink with the caffeine. The presentations of all the food was really good. I like the fact they used different plates or even cutting boards (the formaggi and saumi dish, the meatball was in oven baked dish on top of cutting board also same with friend ordered the lasagna). It definitely gave the food more upscale high end restaurant. It could also be said for the interior decor. The separate private dining rooms they offer, think might only be friday nights but have live band (two people) playing great relax cover music in the bar area, and bar really nice. I like fact got this summer outdoor feel in the tropics inside. We ended up sitting outside on the patio area. They were busy we had no reservation. The patio actually a spot on perfect weather would recommend. They have booths that more like kicking back on couch in one living room with lot of pillows. The view nothing much faces the parking lot. Still feel separate area all by itself for me. The great thing about patio is the band playing not as loud can still have conversations with chill/smoothing music in the background.   The staff was fabulous. Our waitress did great job explaining everything since we were all first timers.  It very rare go into GVR casino but this is one spot would come back too! The HH not only steal of deal, the atmosphere is great, and food  no doubt fan.",

The bartender was snooty, rude, and didn't seem to care about us since we first ordered water.  A big no no I suppose.  I started  (and stopped) with side pasta with marinara.  When she brought is out, it looked ok.  I tasted it, and that was the end.  It tasted like someone dumped sauce from chef boyardee over spaghetti.  I mean really.  No one came back to check forever.  When I told her I didn't like the sauce, she grabbed it away and didn't ask why, what she could get instead, offer to bring me a menu---nothing.  Rude rude rude. So needless to say I didn't even get my entree.  I can't begin to describe how pathetic their customer service was.  I would never recommend this place to anyone.  Gross.",

The interior was super cute. It reminded me of a boho chic/ pier 1 aesthetic. The booths were ugly but the flower chairs were an absolute dream! Our service was great. Our server was extremely attentive, and helpful! I wish I got to try the other foods on the menu but nothing was less than $25.... I think this place should be \"$$$\" instead of 2 because theres no way anyone can afford to eat here on the regular.  I will be back for their oyster happy hour and to check out the patio area!",

We sat at the bar which was pretty open and the restaurant was quieter than it usually was according to my parents.  For anyone with a gluten allergy, be careful. I had heard either from me calling the restaurant or one of my parents that they could accommodate gluten allergies, and also that they could do a number of items gluten free.  When talking to the bar tender about menu disclosures that wasn't the case. They only had three items listed as gluten free and they were all salads. I had asked if they could do the halibut gluten free and it is usually breaded he had said. They were able to accommodate me after all but I did feel sick the next day. I am probably extra sensitive though, mind you.  Most of the menu had items that you would assume would be gluten free especially some of the sides considering they were just vegetables. The ingredients weren't all listed on the menu even though it says what's in the salads, appetizers, and entrees. This happened with something else that said it didn't have dairy but contained milk, it may have been one of the soups or something.   Not the biggest deal ever but definitely look out for it if you eat gluten free, and especially if you have to because of an allergy or intolerance.   I would come here again for drinks hands down because the bar tender was quick with that and the drinks were good. Mine wasn't as strong as I am used to but really not by much. The atmosphere is very bright and summer + spring vibes. That is the whole reason I would come again because with the food the service was slow, but again I have heard it usually isn't that slow. Overall the ambiance is great and sports was on at the bar so it was appealing to both men and women.",

    "text": "If you stay at Green Valley Ranch Resort, go eat here.  You'd be crazy to pass up the food, environment and experience.    The people here are so great.  Hostesses are absolutely beautiful, friendly, and carry themselves well.  Emphasis on the friendly.  They take a Disney attitude:   No matter how stupid your question or comment might be, they respond with total courtesy.    The decor really makes you feel comfortable and in the most idealized version of a country Italian place.  If you're into the European country thing, you can look around here for ideas to incorporate into your home.   Ordered a bottle of Cabernet to start, along with water and lemon.   And as for the food... extremely well done in every way.  We started off with the tomato and mozzarella burrata, a dozen oysters (half Kumamoto and half mid-Atlantic something or other).   For entrees we ended up with the mushroom risotto, short rib cavatelli and rotisserie chicken.   All outstanding.     Finished off with coffee and tiramisu.   If you don't go here, you're simply missing out.  I would eat here regularly.",

The hostesses were indifferent upon our arrival and didn't even acknowledge us let alone thank us for coming in and dropping $100 for 2 people as we departed. Only a couple glasses of wine at HH prices. HH appetizers were VERY small portions. 3 fishy oysters $6. $2 a piece for good oysters is on the high side at normal price. The sausage broccoli rabe was tasty and well prepared. Again a little $$$ for a pasta dish. We had to ask a few times to get some bread to go with it. The rest of the staff and our waitress were friendly and did a descent job. Lots of good Italian Restaurants in Henderson with good food and less expensive with friendly and appreciative staff. Probably won't go back unless to just have a tiramisu.",

Adrian didn't seem confident in recommending drinks. And my friend asked if she could change her drink if she didn't like what she ordered.   In the past when we ate at Bottiglia our servers were always nice enough to stress that we can change our dishes if we don't like them but we never have because the food was always good so we always come back. However Adrian was defensive and stated, \"Um that hasn't happened to me before where a guest sends back a drink and i'm not sure if my manager can do that. Usually guests don't order something they don't like.\" We felt uncomfortable but we ordered drinks anyway.  When I asked for the check, she seemed upset and gave us an attitude as she walked away. We paid for the drinks even though my friend didn't like the drink she ordered and we didn't ask Adrian to take it off the check.   We spoke to the manager, and he was kind enough to remedy the situation however they should really think about retraining her because she seems inexperienced with the items on the menu and how to deliver good service.  We came to Esther's Kitchen in downtown instead. :)",

We decided to go to Bottiglia Enoteca for dinner...Beautiful decor as you walk-in and the table/booth arrangement was very spacious...  Food portions and presentation were great...Taste was superb...We both finished most of our dishes and didn't have room for desert ...The staff were friendly and courteous...  Only cons about this establishment is that our appetizer took awhile and our water was not refilled that often until we asked...  Other than those few issues, the location and staff were nice...The portion, taste, and presentation of the food were amazing...  Will definitely make a visit here again in the near future...",

It's interesting to see similar recent reviews that reflect the poor service from the young kids working the place. But I very recently was speaking to a co-worker about my terrible experience and I wasn't 10 seconds into my story when they began to explain how just weeks ago they also had a bad experience at Bottiglia. However, being much smarter than I they left before spending any money. My coworker told me that the kids at the reception were texting and engaged with each other and almost put out to have to show guests to a table. Once seated no one came to welcome them or take their order. After waiting a while they just left the restaurant which is certainly the option I should have chosen.",

Top notch service for sure. The waiter took his time to ho over the menu and made awesome recommendations.  I had a negroni cocktail that was just as tasty as aromatic. The sphere of ice kept it the perfect temp throughout the meal. The pasta dish with chunks of crab was amazing. It was tossed in the most delicate lemony sauce!  The filet was cooked perfectly and creamy flavorful spinach.  The dessert was really good. A creamy panna cotta with sweet strawberry puree and crunchy pieces of pound cake! -A must try. I will definitely be back to try more menu items!",

Corned beef hash was heavy and thick and cooked through.  Poached egg a little thick (not runny) but still a nice addition.  The potatoes were some of the best breakfast potatoes I'e had, hands down.  Additionally, the chicken sausage was steep for $8, but came with about 2 medium-sized, sliced and plated, sausages.  Crispy skin and thick meat made this a great add-on.  Bottomless mimosas were incredibly affordable at $15 and were definitely bottomless until close at 3pm.  Only downside is it's only orange juice as a mixer, but can't really hate on that.   We had a few issues with some orders at the table, but both were immediately updated and a new dish was provided in full to remediate. Really good customer service to bring an entirely new dish rather than just the missing ingredient.  The waiter additionally comped a pecan sticky bun for dessert and removed the wrong item from our check.  The dessert was exceptional and a must order if I knew how rich and tasty it was.    Brunch game is fantastic here.  Really nice patio as well if the weather is right.  Bottiglia is the real deal if you're in the Henderson area and looking to drink and chow down on a Sunday.",

The male bartenders where the same as the waiters. It just seems really out of place and no reason for it in an upscale restaurant.",

I have a gluten allergy and I have a hard time eating out and this restaurant provides gluten free options. I took a salad to go . I'm always weary with foods cooked in the same area as food with gluten. Always be careful if you are gluten intolerant.  My husband had the veal Marsala and ordered a calamari which arrived in an artistic wooden bowl . The tableware and serving bowls were beautiful . The sangria was excellent as was the service and meals . Ask for Nick next time you visit. He's a wonderful and attentive server . Thanks for the great meal !",

The assistant manager Diane ensured that we were welcomed and greeted properly! It was VIP service from the get-go! Our server Ryan was extremely quick and efficient. He was very friendly and made us feel right at home. We had a few kids with us and he made sure to get crayons to entertain them and also placed their orders so they were not waiting long. However, the wait for our entrees were not very long either.  The eggs Benedict was delicious! We split it, to make plenty of room for mimosas, but the prosciutto was so yummy!   I would def recommend this place and also make reservations since it is pretty busy.",

The pasta is fresh. The ambiance is BEAUTIFUL. The service is great. They also have a private room, so if you want to celebrate something thats a great place to have it. The staff is so helpful too.",

Our server greeted us promptly with her trainee by her side. We started with a couple cocktails, a type of Tequila Mule called Mulo Pazzo with crushed ice and fresh basil and an Italian Stallion which was equally as delicious.  We ordered the Roasted Beet Salad with buffalo milk yogurt, bleu cheese, hazelnuts, and honey which was light and refreshing. Next we had the beef carpaccio with thinly sliced ribeye, cherry pepper aioli, and a poached egg in the middle. The egg was a great addition to a classic Italian dish. For Dinner we shared the gnocchi arrabiata, rotisserie chicken, and a side of the carbonara mac and cheese. We asked the server if they could add shrimp to the gnocchi which they happily obliged. The gnocchi came out piping hot right out of the oven with melted buffalo mozzarella and a sweet san marzano tomato sauce. The rotisserie chicken was served over mashed potatoes and paired well with the carbonara mac and cheese. We finished the night off with the NY style cheesecake with warm cherries which came highly recommended by a friend and did not disappoint. Everything we ate and drank was very well executed. We're excited to try caprese salad, meatballs, and lobster fra diavolo next time. Great Addition to Green Valley Ranch Station!",

Served with cocktail sauce and a mignonette. I like my cocktail sauce spicier than what they serve, but the waiter brought some extra horseradish, so it was no problem. I like that you can order it in threes, and can mix and match east coast and west coast. The wife and I weren't too hungry, so I just had the burger, which they made like a panini for me after asking about it. My wife had the gnocchi. I tasted that and was not at all disappointed in the spice. Both were great. Neither of us were drinking so I didn't look at the wines list, but I saw the by the glass selection on the back of the brunch menu and they had a few of my favorites. I'll definitely be back to try dinner and to see what the place looks like after the sun goes down.",

I'm guessing it was because we decided to sit outside but food was great enough for us to definitely try again. We sat for a while before being acknowledged at all, and I ordered a second glass of wine which didn't come out for an unreasonable amount of time and she finally came out as I was finishing my entree and so I politely declined the wine. There was no hesitation or apology since I'm sure she realized how long it took. Anyway we ordered the octopus appetizer which was really nicely prepared, and the two must haves I would recommend are the bucatini pasta dish and the braised short rib which was tender and fantastic! Some happy hour dishes were nothing I'd order again but those two entrees for sure were enough to come back! We ordered the dessert sampler which was simply ok. Panna Cotta and donuts were meh, and tiramisu was tasty but nothing worth writing about. The perfect place to meet with girlfriends and enjoy the ambiance!",

    "text": "This was a disaster.  It started at the hostess stand, where the hostess asked my first and last name and then proceeded to type into her computer for eleven minutes, then asking someone else to show us to our table.  (in an empty place) I was served an ice tea and water with an ice cube in each one; needless to say they were warm very quickly.  I ordered the pappardelle bolognese.  The server brought me a dish of cavatelli with meat sauce.  When I told him this wasn't what I ordered, he had to track down my waitress.  She said, \"Oh, you don't want this?\"  I told her I wanted what I ordered, then she told me that yes, they were out of pappardelle.  I told her I didn't want this, to take it off the bill.  I asked for a bread plate, as one was not offered.  Restaurants like this annoy me.  You are in a locals casino, not the strip.  Charging $24 for chicken parm, with nary a strand of spaghetti or a salad does not make you a \"high-end\" place, it just makes you overpriced.  And please train your wait staff BEFORE you open.",

    "text": "This place is amazing! Beautiful decor, relaxed ambiance, great service, and delicious food+drinks. I made a reservation of 7 for a Friday night, and I showed up prior the rest of my party's arrival but was seated right away. As I sat down and waited for everyone else with my boyfriend I realized that I forgot to mention to the hostess that we would have a baby joining our party so we'd need to set up a sling for the carrier, so as soon as I realized it I had my boyfriend go and let her know. She came back and told us she would go ahead and move us into a private dining room since the high top tables would be too tall for the baby's seat. We followed her into a beautiful private dining room that we had all to ourselves, which was very nice to have to be able to shut the doors and have a quiet dinner amongst the family. We really enjoyed every aspect of the restaurant, as I mentioned before the service was great, the food was too, and the 2 drinks I tried off their cocktail menu were fabulous. At some point someone in my group snuck off and told our server what our special occasion was for celebrating that night, so at the end of our dinner our server was sweet enough to surprise me by bringing out every item off their dessert menu for us, compliments of the house because it was my bday!! The donut holes and tiramisu were 2 of my favorites, and they had one of their workers sing me a birthday song in Italian as they walked in surprising me with the dessert galore lol, and I must say that he was awesome!!! He has a beautiful voice and it was very cool to hear him singing in Italian, it was definitely a wonderful finishing touch to the dinner and my overall experience at Bottiglia. I'll definitely recommend checking out this spot to all my friends!! The staff was very thoughtful, and made my bday dinner a great one for sure.",

    "text": "4 stars is an excellent showing for a newer restaurant like this! I gotta admit, I didn't have confidence that this place would be an instant success. GVR has been playing \"guess what restaurant is coming next\" forevvvver!  The decor itself is worth eating here, as it's so pretty, and the patio is awesome too!  The whole vibe is very springtime/upscale, and many details such as the cool glassware shouldn't be overlooked. We sat inside near a window that overlooked the patio, and I couldn't help but notice that taller landscaping would obscure the parking lot view and make that patio oh so more enticing!   My recent visit was for a business mixer, and we were treated to wine and appetizers. The food was just great all around! The meatballs were delish and I especially enjoyed the eggplant caviar. Servers were attentive and didn't completely disappear when our group quickly expanded to a crowd. I look forward to returning for more menu sampling!",

Specials: - Happy Hour; Mon - Thurs, 5PM - 7PM, $6 small bites and $6 drinks (wine, draft beer, and well drinks) - Half Off Wine Bottles; ALL DAY Thurs!  I came here with one of my girlfriends on a Thursday for Happy Hour. We sat at the bar and shared a bottle of Davis Bynum Chardonnay (since all bottles were half off!) My friend ordered the wood roasted eggplant spread and I ordered the cheese and salami board. She didn't care for her eggplant spread but I love charcuterie and thought this board was well worth the $6! A few meat selections, 2 slices of cheese, bread, and an apricot or peach like chutney/jelly. All of it was delicious and paired perfectly with the Chardonnay.   The bartenders were nice and attentive - no complaints there!  I really enjoyed my overall experience and look forward to coming back. I'd most likely come back on a Thursday to enjoy a bottle of wine and small bites!",

    "text": "Absolutely thrilled about this place. I waited until I had eaten here a couple times to review since they are very new and I honestly didn't have to. All of my visits here have been five star worthy. This place has everything I wanted and needed close to home.   Let's start with the atmosphere. Beautifully decorated, every object in this restaurant seems curated. You'll wish your home was decorated identically to Bottiglia. And don't even get me started on the patio. My goodness. It's like being in an extremely elegant backyard. There are potted plants galore (as an avid plant lover, I'm a bit biased here), misters, a fire pit, lounge seating... I can keep going. I could LIVE on that patio.   I see some yelpers may have had bad service... I have been multiple times and service has never lacked. My first visit was in the first week of opening and things were a little slower, however, I wasn't in a rush. Dinner is meant to be enjoyed, and why would you want to rush out of a place as pleasant as this? Servers are happy to offer suggestions, rush to get your happy hour orders in, and are overall very friendly. The restaurant is managed very well, and everyone seems to deeply care for the restaurant and the experience each customer has.   The food... THE FOOD. Now, this is NOT traditional Italian. If that is what you are expecting, do not get your hopes up. The food is based in Italian food, for sure, but it more modern, fancier, and has interesting non-traditional combinations than you would see in homemade classic Italian food. Very surprising, delicious, adventurous combinations, that if you get your head in the right place, you will enjoy immensely!   My favorite things on the menu:   Zucchini Flowers (IN LOVE) Short Rib with dumplings Carbonara Mac & Cheese Arancini   Give this place a shot, especially if you are a local. You never know, it could become a new favorite spot! It is for us!",

The food was delicious and full of flavor, you could really tell the chef planned out the menu with delicious choices.  My absolute favorite main course dish was the Lobster pasta and The zucchini flowers was my absolute favorite appetizer.  Although I still strongly love the zucchini flowers I can't say much for the Lobster dish, maybe because last time I ordered it I was unimpressed. I attempted to devour the dish but couldn't enjoy it. It was so spicy that my taste buds were on fire- literally!  I was a bit disappointed that it was all spice and no flavor to follow.  I wanted to enjoy to enjoy it but sadly couldn't. I hope the next time I order this dish, they take it easy on the spice, there is alway a happy medium for spicy food and the dish was way off!   I still have lots of love and hope for this place. It has a fun upbeat summery feel to it and the decor is absolutely beautiful, they also have a patio. The location is great it's at the Green Valley Casino. The service is great when they're not busy, which Pretty much all restaurants will fall into this category. Everyone has their bad days, but the food quality should over shadow those faults!  So today I give them a 4 star, and I hope my next visit will turn out like my first.",

The Chopped Salad was nice, and the shishito peppers in there were a nice addition.   For entrees, the King Crab Bucatini was great. The Meyer lemon cream made the dish and the pasta was a perfect al dente. There was a small amount of shell, somewhat expected given the crab is fresh but still you need to be careful. The Pan Roasted Halibut was perfectly cooked and the carrot puree complimented it nicely. The risotto was good. Only issue, there were a few bones in the fish.   I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "I have now been here twice and had similar experiences both times.  We sat at a table both times, not the bar.  I have a friend who dined at the bar two times and absolutely loved it.  The first time we had a server by the name of Raul serve us, last night we had Heidi.  The first time we ordered wine, for appetizers we shared the eggplant spread and caprese salad.  For our entrees I had the chicken parm and my company had the eggplant parm.  The server was overly attentive at first and then it went down hill.  We noticed other tables with a bread display on them so I asked after our appetizers were already almost done.  Raul said that was his mistake and he forgot.  How do you forget a major thing like that.  He brought it over shortly after.  The eggplant spread did not come with enough bread for the amount of spread we had.  The chicken parm was decent but a bit soggy.    The food was decent but the service was the main issue.  The water service was very inconsistent.  They would bring iced water one round and then non-iced water the next.  Our server, Raul, went missing in the middle of the dinner and when we needed water, another glass of wine, a box, Raul was no where to be found.   Another server came over and took our order of coffee and dessert and the boxes we requested.  Raul then was back and we told him how we already ordered through someone else and he brought us boxes after we already got the boxes.  There was no communication between servers.  We were very close to the server station and could overhear them having having a disagreement.  The staff overall seemed a bit nervous and all over the place.  Last night we gave this spot a 2nd chance.  We called earlier in the day to make a reservation and they told us there wasn't any availability.  We then called back at 5pm when the restaurant was open and they said they had plenty.  It's a good thing we called back or they could have lost business based on the earlier phone call.    This time we had Heidi as our server.  Heidi was good at first however in the middle of our dining experience she kind of went missing too.  We ordered a glass of wine and a mule to start.  The wine came in a timely fashion however I had to ask again about my mule.  She went on to explain it was the bartenders 2nd day as he transferred from a sister property.  As someone in the industry I understand what this means but as someone dining at your establishment I frankly don't care, I just want my beverage.  We then ordered bruschetta.  We noticed on the menu it said it was supposed to have buffalo milk yogurt so after we received it we asked about it and we saw Heidi go up to the kitchen and ask but it was clear she didn't know her ingredients.    After our appetizers Heidi offered to take away our utensils and bread plates however I didn't use my knife and fork and one person in my party didn't want new ones and Heidi seemed confused by this.  For entrees we had spinach lasagna, chicken parm, and a side of spaghetti squash.  The food took a little while to get out and Heidi said \"let me go see what's up with your food\".  Interesting verbiage.  She was great on the water service but she could definitely work on eloquent verbiage.  One observation we did make was that a bearded man who we assume was the GM was around talking to all of the servers and meeting with them when we were sitting there waiting on entrees and stuff. It seemed as though his time could have been spent doing something more beneficial to the guests.  He walked by us several times and noticed us looking around but never did a table touch.  I wouldn't recommend coming here for a meal sitting at a table but I would give it a shot at the bar probably one more time to see if I could have a better experience.",

The food itself was not traditional Italian , but that's okay!! The inspiration is there and the tastes are great. I was stuck between a couple entrees to choose from and our happy and professional server Kobee sent out the dish of his choice.   It was a nightly special! The Sole. It had a simple lemon butter sauce, absolutely delicious.",

Our waitress, Mackenzie, was so sweet and very attentive. The avocado toast was some of the best I'd ever had, and the Prosciutto Eggs Benedict was AMAZING. Of course, those paired with the bottomless mimosas made for a great brunch. Highly recommend having brunch here on Sundays!",

Our server Michelle created  a wonderful experience and Manager Mary stopped by briefly to assure everything was to our liking.

My boyfriend and I came here to try it real quick before we got a massage. I got a glass of moscato with the Banzino dish. My boyfriend ordered the chicken piccata. He loved his chicken dish. I liked my Banzino fish dish but I thought it could be improved. They do give you plenty of the fish though. Fish was cooked well but it tasted a little fishy to me still and I like my fish with a clean taste. Didn't care for the sides that came under the fish although the arugula salad underneath was refreshing. I would like to come back here to eat outside on their patio because it looked very cozy and nice.",

The atmosphere of the restaurant is amazing and has so much positive energy. I ordered drinks we were celebrating so we drank champagne after about two we headed out to dinner, but it was not here. I am going to celebrate Mother's Day here so will update later when try food.  Now here it is Mother's Day and I am having my mothers dinner this restaurant is even more beautiful in the day time. I love the lavender that the servers where as well it is a nice touch to the ambiance of the restaurant.   This trip I had another Caesar salad which is always good and tried the meatball sandwiches with zucchini fries. The portion size of the salad is so large that I could not finish it. The meatball sandwich were slider style and the taste of the meatball with its red sauce was so delicious. The freshness of all their ingredients shows in the wonderful taste that all come together on your tastebuds.",

When I walked into the the place, it felt like I was transported to an Italian villa that just happened to have a full size bar! The inside was so nice and the decor was amazing! It had an open kitchen so we could see the cooks preparing dishes.  I ordered the tagliatelle with the mushrooms and truffle cream sauce. It was so good! The sauce was so rich and creamy and the mushrooms were perfectly cooked. My friend beside me had the lasagna and she let me have a bite. Wow, was that good! I dont know how many layers this thing had, but every layer had a spinach tomato sauce and cheese in it and it was topped with more sauce and cheese! It was so delicious! The chef even came by to talk to the birthday girl and surprised her and the rest of us with some desserts on the house! It was truly a great night! So if youre in Henderson and youre looking for a great Italian restaurant with great food, great atmosphere and great service, look no further than Bottiglia (pronounced bo-TEE-ya from what I heard)!",

    "text": "Chose Bottiglia for dinner because they were participating in Restaurant week. We had reservations and were seated immediately upon arrival. The dining room has baguette booths and tables. They also have tables on the outdoor patio. I recommend the baguette for comfort, and some privacy. The decor is bright with plenty of natural light from the large windows. Service was spot on from our server Kobe. He checked on us periodically and  promptly removed empty dishes. Happy Hour is available throughout the restaurant which allowed us to order wine at a discount. Complementary garlic bread with olive oil and balsamic started our dinner. Nice soft bread with embedded garlic cloves.    The following 3 courses were ordered from the Restaurant week menu. Meatballs Chicken Parm Tiramisu  The Chicken Piccata entree was ordered from the regular menu.  The three meatballs were tender and served in a flavorful tomato sauce. The Chicken Parm was two large breasts served with fresh cheese and the same great sauce as the meatballs. The chicken was perfectly cooked with a nice crisp breading. Tiramisu is served is a mason type jar layered and topped with chocolate shavings. A great tasting dessert.  The Chicken Piccata was four pieces of breasts pounded thin and served in a lemon butter sauce which was perfectly balanced.  The portions of both entrees were large enough to provide some take home.   I am awarding 4 instead of 5 stars due to the very loud music. It is not a conversation friendly environment. In addition, the dining room has large TV screens on most walls which takes away from the dining atmosphere.",

My dinner at Bottiglia was nothing short of amazing and definitely one of those memorable experiences. What a gem in Las Vegas/Henderson for the locals and tourists alike.  I am such a huge fan of the station casinos. Green Valley Ranch is on another level though. I've been to the buffet here and to Hank's and never knew about Bottiglia until someone referred me.  I came during happy hour and just thought it was so modern and chic but welcoming and Lowkey at the same time. Their happy hour is a great deal to grab wine with friends and have a bite to eat.  My standout dishes were the mushroom pasta, the stuffed squash blossoms, and their calamari. We also had their octopus served with potatoes and it was the most tender octopus you'll ever try. The presentation of all the dishes is as good as anywhere and everything is done so well.   Their bar is also amazing! They have a full bar and they give Hank's a run for their money in the martini game with their Classic Martini.  The thing that I was most impressed with was their service. We were helped by so many different staff members but their continuity of service was just spot on. Their management also check on tables multiple times during service.  I know I will be back here because I crave some of the dishes. The mushroom pasta, the stuffed squash blossoms, and the octopus dish are still being day dreamed about! I recommend Bottiglia with no reservations about anything. What an awesome place for a date, to catch up with friends, or to impress some colleagues.   Oh I forgot and had to edit: THE FRESHEST OYSTERS EVER! Freshest? Most fresh? Either way amazing.",

Both myself and my dining partner experienced severe cramping and diarrhea after eating at Bottiglia.  Contacted management and they did not seem to be concerned.  Had to ask if they served bread, which we saw on everyone else's table, had to ask what the \"specials\" of the evening were, and basically not real excited about the service and definitely not with the food, particularly considering the inflated prices for just pasta.",

I wanted to get away from all of the madness on the Vegas Strip.  I can truly say I made the right decision.  Management and the wait staff was outstanding. Our waiter was full of personality and well versed on the menu options.  The manager came to our table and added the finishing touches on our visit.  This restaurant is customer centric and the food is amazing.  We left feeling like our patronage was valued.  I highly recommend this place!",

The wait-staff does an excellent job with menu knowledge as well as recommendations. The food is coursed out properly and timely, and comes out very well put together.   The specialty cocktails are all well put together and go down extremely easy. They pair with many of the dishes seen on the menu and aren't over priced.   I'd highly recommend trying the arancini's as well as the wild porcini tagliatelle. It's really delectable and surprisingly not as heavy as thought to be. The hand crafted pasta has some extremely nice notes or mushroom and truffle.  Diana and Mary do an excellent job managing the restaurant and are very attentive to guest needs and accommodations.   Kobee, Kelly, and Chelsea have all waited on myself in the past and are top notch servers. Very attentive  and courteous. If you get lucky enough to have one of them as your server, your dining experience will be stellar.",

Being one of the station casino restaurants, it's nice to see that they've survived.  First and foremost they offer some of the best pasta in the Henderson area. By far some of the best values around for the price. Portions and pretty decent and the quality is here. Definitely not an Olive Garden style restaurant.  It's conveniently located on one of the side of the green valley ranch so you don't have to worry about having to walk through the casino to get to it.  They have great specials like half off pastas randomly through the year so always check. They also have dollar oyster specials.   We highly recommend the spinach lasagna. Amazing layers of perfectly cooked pasta, cheese and spinach all surrounded in a rich savory tomato sauce. For sure a 5/5 at only $22.  They also offer the king crab bucatini which is the most popular dish. A pricy one at that as well at $32 a plate. Decent pasta with chunks of king crab with a Meyer lemon cream sauce. First time we had it it was phenomenal, second time sucked because there was a piece of shell that got lodged between my teeth cutting me pretty bad. The manager came right away and took it off the bill along with our drinks.  Give the zucchini flowers a try as well. It's pretty much friend zucchini stuffed with a ricotta filling. Pretty tasty for $15.  Overall people are friendly, location is good and the service and food are consistent and good!",

We started by being greeted by a beautiful hostess & being seated rather promptly. When we were seated our server (Ryan) took care of our drinks, he knew his food, & had us sold immediately. I enjoyed an amazing dish of a Prosciutto egg Benedict w/ hollandaise & chives. It was so GOOD! My mom enjoyed a buffalo mozzarella panini & had a side of apple chicken sausage !

Smashed potatoes made an appearance in more than one dish, so I'd recommend for staff to offer another side if they notice a guest going in that direction.  Thank you so much for a great meal and time. We'll be back.",

The room is beautiful and service was good, but that was the limit to the superlatives other than the fact that the meal was comped.  My wife and I settled on a shared Caesar salad which was pretty much tasteless and rather petite for $13. We also shared an order of wood roasted Brussel sprouts with hazelnuts, ricotta salata and pomegranate that was dried out from overcooking and served at almost room temperature.  We did not fare any better with our entrees of pan roasted halibut with farro risotto, carrot puree and peas.  I had specified on ordering that I wanted the fish medium rare, but just like on our previous visit, the fish was overdone.  We also ordered strawberry panacottas that were larger than expected, but not nearly as smooth nor flavorful and one would expect.",

The hostess was extremely attentive to make sure we got seats at the bar as soon as they opened up which was appreciated after a long day of work. My friend and I both enjoyed the mulo plazzos which I recommend for those Moscow Mule lovers and they're only $7 each with the happy hour menu. We split a medium sized antipasti and zucchini flowers which were to die for!!! We went on a Friday night and they had live music which created a relaxing, comfortable ambiance in such a trendy, beautifully decorated and clean restaurant!  The service at the bar was nothing short of exceptional considering how busy the bar was for a Friday night we were consistently checked up on by the bartenders. I have tried just about every happy hour offered by the GVR restaurants but the ambiance, service and happy hour prices at Bottiglia have been my favorite by far!!! You will not be disappointed I rest assure you!",

The floor plan is open and airy.  They have a \"lounge\" area at the entrance which I assume is part of the bar.  I don't know since we had regular dinner seating both times. They also have an area for if you want to do a \"private party\".  It's not totally private but it can be your own area of the restaurant. They also have a nice patio area and as soon as the temps drop, I'm sure that will the place to sit and enjoy the evening.  We enjoyed Brian and Gerald's hospitality on the 2 occasions we've been.  Both are Excellent!  Friendly, Genuine, Sincere and Accommodating!  The first time I went I enjoyed the Mediterranean Branzino.  It's fabulous!  Tender and Filling!  They don't skimp... I think it was the whole fish!  And the side that comes with it is light and lovely..... quinoa and chick peas with a lemon vinaigrette. I would totally order this again.  The next time I went I had the Halibut.  It was also very good.  But truth be told.... I'd pick the Branzino over the Halibut.  We also started with the Chopped Salad.  I highly recommend sharing this salad.... or have it as your main meal.  It's quite large and can be filling if you eat the whole thing by yourself.  This is another one of those, \"I'm totally ordering this again\" type of dishes.  Also, go on a Thursday ... their bottles of wine under $100 are 1/2 priced!",

They said the hostess will return shortly. We sat at the bar and when we were finishing up, I noticed another couple dealing with the same issue we had. It looked like the hostess was flirting with some boys on the other side of the restaurant. Other than that, no issues. Bartenders were great too! Sorry about my photos.

I got the king crab bucatini, regular price is $32 but only paid $16. You can tell by the taste of it, it's made fresh and in house. The sauce was amazing, creamy with a lemon taste to it and the crab meat was the best! Tuesdays they also have a $1 oyster deal so we took advantage of that :) we all also checked in for a free glass of wine. We sure did get a deal out of the whole dining experience. The complementary bread were good too, the butter didn't taste like butter it had more of a lighter lemon taste to it, super good. The server was on top of it, with the refill of water and making sure we were all doing okay and we got our food pretty quickly.  The ambiance is a 5/5, such a nice theme and decor. The restroom was kind of weird, both male and female using the same restroom made it feel kind of awkward. But our overall experience was a great one.",

The two star review is because their \"Social Sunday\" is the opposite of a good setting for a social afternoon with friends. The DJ blaring club music makes to nearly impossible to have a conversation at the table and it doesn't suit the vibe of the restaurant. We kept having to ask the server to repeat themselves because we couldn't hear. A request for the volume to be lowered a bit was met with \"that's how she does Sundays\". Ok, that's how I decide to eat somewhere else next time. I suppose they are trying to do something to set themselves apart from all the other restaurants in the area but this isn't it. Too many other places to eat and chat with friends at Sunday brunch to come here again.",

A couple girlfriends and I came in for happy hour, I was sold with the 1/2 off bottles of wine on Thursdays. Once you walk in it's very well decorated, almost like a pier one meets southern house wife. The place was huge and has a nice outdoor patio too.   For food we shared a few different items. The Beef Carpaccio I would say was 5/5. The beef was very fresh and tender and the seasoning was minimal, not too overbearing. I also really enjoyed the Caesar Salad, 5/5. The portion size was pretty small which is expected of HH, but very good flavor. I didn't care much for the Arancini, 1/5. I thought it tasted like a fried version of chef boyardee. Meatballs were 4/5 and Cheese & Salami Board 4/5, they both had good flavors, but nothing to \"wow\" me.   Overall I thought this was a very cute place with some good Italian bites. I would come back again to try their brunch or $1 oysters.",

    "text": "We made reservations for Thursday evening at 6:15 and upon arrival were immediately seated though we were 15 minutes early.  Within a 1/2 hour the restaurant was packed. We were a party of 3, wife, mum and myself. The waiter quickly brought us a wide variety of breads and some butter. We ordered some waters and I checked in for the free glass of white wine.  We looked at the happy hour menu and decided on a couple appetizers: the meat balls with gravy, garlic lemon bread crumbs and buretta, and then the bucatini which came with basil pesto, charred zucchini and pecorino Romano cheese. The two meatballs were very tender and covered with plenty of sauce, we actually used the leftover sauce to dip the bread into. The bucatini tasted refreshing and light, the thicker noodle combined with the pesto was a nice combination.  For the entree's we chose the pappardelle bolognese which came with san marzano, pancetta and a red wine sauce. The pappardelle noodle is house made fresh daily, is very thin and combined with the aforementioned sauce was superb. My mum ordered the wild mushroom risotto accompanied by mascarpone, truffle butter and chives and topped with spinach and a mix of vegetables. Delicious was her response.  Service was very good, they are very attentive and with a mention of my wife's birthday, they were quick to bring out a tiramisu topped with chocolate shavings and a candle with a couple of chocolate dipped cookies. Tim to the last spoonful. The perfect way to finish a great meal. We will be back again. Thank you Bottiglia!",

    "text": "Thanks to L.C. For a great impromptu birthday dinner!   I enjoyed a lovely evening with friends in this beautiful restaurant.  The bright and open dining area has modern yet inviting decor.  We were seated promptly to start our experience.    Happy hour was still open so we decided to share a few items for the table.  The HH cheese and salami board has such a cute presentation.  It's a great way to start our meal.    The HH Meatballs were just ok but nothing to write home about.  The HH Caesar Salad topped off our starters which was perfect since 3 of us were sharing.     Now for the highlight- my friend and I shared the Mushroom risotto and the Chicken Parmesan. Holy moly! Chicken Parmesan overly huge.  We actually divided it three ways and it was still a large serving.  The Wild Mushroom Risotto hit my taste buds with a bang.  I would recommend this masterpiece of a dish.  The mascarpone, truffle butter and chives combined beautifully.    The service was attentive throughout the evening.  However, I wondered why the waiter suggested ordering more pasta on the side of the chicken when its such a large serving. I'm glad we only had the risotto with the chicken parm.   If you order the Parmesan dish, definitely share it.    Of course since we were celebrating, we shared the dessert sampler of strawberry panacotta, tiramisu and lemon poppy seed donuts.  Fantastic.  Each little dessert is perfected.  The pannacotta is light and sweet complimented by the dense little donut with blueberry dipping sauce.  Their tiramisu has a strong nutty taste brought by the frangelico.  Little desserts make up this strong sampler.    I was pleased with my first adventure here.  I hope there will be many more.",

If it's nice outside, sit on their beautiful patio. Bar is just as pleasing. The tequila version of a Moscow Mule is must try.   I'm a regular for the happy hour specials but they're just the full size portion made half size hence half the price. So it's really not a special but beggars can't be choosers when it comes to a deal. On the other hand, the $1 oyster special on Tuesdays are one heck of a deal! The reason I keep coming back. Find the dish you love and stick with it. I've strayed a bit on the menu and have gotten hit or miss pastas. Miss because I can make a vegetarian pasta way more exciting at home and I'm not that creative. And beware! The bread that comes to the table is highly addicting. Stay away!",

There was a big bridal shower that reserved the entire outdoor patio.   Went here with my sis for brunch. Been here before when I had my bachelorette brunch with my girls. The restaurant looks like something out of Pinterest with a shabby chic vibe that is bright and inviting. They also have outdoor dining for dining al fresco. Btw mostly women were dining here. If you're bringing your man there are TVs showing football lol.   We ordered the cinnamon bread pudding as a starter. It was delicious and served warm with a salted caramel sauce on the side to dip. We also shared the chicken panini with fries and the corned beef with poached egg with roasted potatoes. Both were delicious! We were surprisingly stuffed walking out. Will be back for our next brunch!",

If you want a martini head over to Hank's also in GVR ~ as not an Happy Hour option ~      The appetizers we all good~ we had the zucchini blossoms, meat balls & fried mozzarella.     The zucchini blossoms good however a very definite orange flavour, not bad just different from what I've had elsewhere ~ 2 per order, I just LOVE 'em. The meat balls were OK, these are never one of my go to options but my friend wanted them 2 per order, so it worked out fine. The fried mozzarella niiice, ample portion with good marinara sauce~      I have been here b4 for dinner and really like the interior design, fabrics and feel of the place. Our server was a bit odd tonight, seemed a bit put off that we only were having drinks & apps, didn't bother us we just both had the same vibe from her.",

Ate the 2 pieces.  When original server brought bill, I told her about the shortage of veal on my dish.  She told me someone new was working that night and they were having some problems.  She proceeded to tell me I shouldn't be concerned because I was already receiving a discount!!  What poor customer attitude and service. This waitress shouldn't be in the service industry.

From a cloyingly sour pomegranate limeade to meatballs easily beat by Costco....to overly acidic, under-salted, butter-drowned lackluster dishes devoid imagination and most importantly flavor. Salt, herbs, and creativity all amiss in the midst of gorgeous ambiance and a cool setting. Very deceptive. Was so excited to try this place....beyond underwhelmed, disappointed. We are guests at GV, based on this experience we will not eat anything else in the hotel. They took a few items off but it was not a sufficient compensation for such a poor experience. To be clear server was great, manager was reasonable, but food was a major disappointment. Would like this experience back!! As visitors in Las Vegas, a masterfully brilliant culinary city, wasting one meal on a subpar disappointing experience is more than just a let down...it's super frustrating! We recommend you go elsewhere!! I was going to recommend Scott Conant, but I see he's at Red Rock....Get that guy over hear to educate these folks!!!",

    "text": "Really disappointed in my dinner at Bottiglia.  I think my expectations may have been a little unrealistic given the number of positive reviews, but this place just did not land for me.  Our party of three arrived around 6:45 on a Sunday and were seated immediately.  The space is nice, but there were TVs in virtually every section.  While I like to watch games as much as the next guy while I am eating, the TVs did not match the decor.  Service was okay at the beginning of the meal, then got progressively worse throughout the evening.  We were immediately served the gratis bread basket and our drinks.  Of the bread, the only one that was semi-memorable were the crisps with baked on cheese.  The remaining bread was average at best, but it was good at sopping up the sauce of the arancini.  This was a strong appetizer, probably the best dish of the evening.  Very cheesy and the sauce was seasoned well.  We did not let any of this dish go to waste.  The calamari was our second appetizer, and this one did not go as well.  To begin, it was either not fried at a hot enough temperature or was left in the grease too long.  The vast majority of the pieces were not crispy, some were downright soggy.  Additionally, the breading did not adher well to the pieces.  The red sauce served on the side was fine, and the cream-based sauce was very good.  But, the calamari was a miss completely.  It took an excessive amount of time for us to receive our entrees.  So much time the server apologized, which was appreciated.    To eat, I went with the Caesar salad and the braised short rib.  That dish is served with ricotta spinach dumplings.  The short rib was good, but not nearly as tender as I expected given that this dish was braised.  I did not finish the entree.  I did, however, finish all of the dumplings.  These were pillowy soft and cheesy but had a very slight crust to them.  Very good, I should have ordered more on the side.  One in our party had the veal ravioli.  It came with 4 regular-sized ravioli for $26.  I am sure it was good, but that is too small for an appetizer.  I also know that the majority of Italian places have designed their menus so you order both a pasta and a main course.  So, I am not expecting a mountain of pasta in any dish.  But, when he only ordered the ravioli the server should have warned him how small the dish was.    Finally, to cap off the evening, we waited more than a half hour before we received our check and were able to leave.  We just sat there with empty plates (or, more accurately, plates that were clearly finished because our silverware and/or napkins had been placed on the remaining food) for way too long.    Perhaps we went on an off night, that can certainly happen.  Or, maybe I just don't get it given the number of Yelpers that really liked this joint.  But, this place simply did not land for me.  Also, I much preferred its predecessor, Terra Verde.  On future trips to Green Valley Ranch I do not think I will be returning.",

    "text": "Higher end Italian-American restaurant in GVR (Green Valley Ranch).  Decor is nice and definitely not a cookie cutter type of feel.   I've been eyeing this spot for a while since they opened.  I went with a group of 5 and I ordered the calamari as an app for the group along with chicken parm and a side of pasta.  The pasta does not come with the dish and everything has to be ordered separately which I don't mind at all.  The chicken quality and taste was good.  The pasta and sauce was absolutely average at best.  This is the sad part to me.  I think the chicken itself was $25 plus the side of pasta being $6 I was expecting a lot more...especially from the pasta.  It was your basic spaghetti with marinara.  I also knocked it down a notch because our waiter made us wait over 15 minutes for bread and kept telling us they were \"making it\"...so naturally I was thinking it was going to be fresh made (at least warm) bread.  It was cold and serviceable...nothing special at all...so when he said they were making it, he meant that someone had to throw the cold bread in a basket.  We were already done with our apps by the time the bread basket came out.  I would go back to try it again, but more than likely I'll just go to Pizza Rock when I'm back at this hotel.",

It's usually at the bottom of the list whenever I eat out.  Turns out that this was the best Italian meal I've ever had!  I was very impressed and I've had meals in Venice, Italy!  I had the sausage rigatoni that was just absolutely amazing!  The flavor was delicious, the pasta was a perfect al dente!  Setting is perfect for a date night but also included tv's in the patio where I was able to watch the NBA season opener.  Our server Michelle was awesome!  She took great care of our party for sure.  There were 8 of us, 5 adults and 3 kids.  She was very knowledgeable and answered every question our party had.  There were a lot of questions and she was even accommodating to my pregnant wife especially there are ingredients that doesn't settle too well.  Super friendly and her customer service was great!  Anytime we needed something, she was on it and never once seemed annoyed.  Would definitely come back for sure!",

    "text": "Just left this restaurant . It was our second time dining here.  Nothing close to our first experience, unfortunately.  First off, they changed their bread as of last week.  It was awful.  If you are not a huge garlic fan, this bread is not for you.  I like garlic bread but this was something of an unspecified sort.  It had an odd, distinct taste. The only way I remotely knew it was garlic bread was the fact that there was a clove attached to the serving plate under the bread slices.  Regardless, it was bad.  Next came the entrees.  My friend asked for shrimp scampi for which they accommodated since it wasn't on the menu.  But, the portion was a joke in comparison to the FOUR SHRIMP it contained and the hefty price of $32.  The meat dishes such as chicken parm come a la carte. Everywhere else serves a side a pasta, at least. Not a huge stretch considering pasta is the cheapest thing! We asked for butter with our bread and the busser didn't understand English and totally blew us off. Finally caught a nice busser who took care of our request.  We ended the meal with cannoli. Big mistake.  The filling was runny and nothing like what my Italian family and I make from scratch.  The server was slow moving. We never had our glasses refilled until dessert.  All in all, not worth the visit.  The two stars are for accommodating the shrimp scampi request and for the service of two out of the three bussers.  We will not return.",

If you like atmosphere that makes you believe you're in a movie, service which makes you feel like a star in that film and most importantly, food that will convince you you've gone to dining heaven...then, this Brunch is perfect for you!  Susan and I were greeted warmly and shown to our raised table and high chairs. From out of nowhere, Gerald, our waitperson was instantly on hand to further our greeting and ask what he could do to make us comfortable. Having studied the menu on our computer, we ordered a pitcher of Bellini, along with tap water and lemon wedges.  Again, having studied the menu at home, Susan knew she wanted the Hanger Steak entree, while being a big fan of gnocchi, I ordered the Baked Gnocchi Arrabbiata. We sipped our peach-flavored cocktails and suddenly were greeted by the genial General Manager, Javier Parra. He, too, looked as though he stepped out of a movie and asked about ourselves and what we'd ordered.  When I told him of the gnocchi, he said it was so spicy, that even a day later, as a leftover...it would still be hot!  What a wonderful way to make a couple feel wanted and appreciated.  Susan's steak arrived perfectly medium-rare and smokey from grilling. Resting on small, roasted potatoes, my wife said they were like tender mini baked potatoes. She gave me a couple of pieces of steak before I dug into my gnocchi and I told her it was the best hanger steak I'd ever had!  My baked arrabbiata was as foretold...spicy but not too hot.  The tender little pillows didn't kill my tastebuds but still made we want the next forkful.  Gerald was an amazing waitperson and Javier was the most hospitable manager we've met in 14  1/2 years in Henderson. So, as I stated before, if you haven't yet tried the Sunday Brunch at Bottiglia...what are you waiting for?",

Lots of pieces of shell though, I understand they're only a dollar and the shucker is cranking em out but if every other oyster I'm picking out shell it gets to be a little much. GF and I also shared the octopus and beef carpaccio which were both delicious.  There were a few things about the bar service as for the reason I couldn't give this place 5 stars.  1. I had asked the bartender to put on a hockey game, she said she'd ask a manager, she never did, the bar wasn't busy and the tv was on sports center with no one else watching. 2. The bartender was a little too caught up in her phone. The pos system was right in front of us and she kept her cell phone to the side and she was constantly texting. My girlfriend and I are bartenders too so we get it, but she shouldn't do it standing right in front of guests. 3. I asked for a shot which she forgot till check time after I reminded her. It wasn't on the first bill she gave me, only after she ran my card. Idc that it was on there, but she didn't even mention that she added it and corrected the tab. Just charged me for it and dropped the check. You should always mention to the guest when adjusting totals.  All in all I was impressed with the food and will return for more oysters. The hiccups in service were just that and I know I'm nitpicking but when my GF and I are both bartenders on the strip we notice the little things and the little things matter to service industry folk sometimes.",

I had the vegan chickpea bolognese and it was delicious. We also shared the spaghetti squash and my husband had eggplant parmesan. Everything was great. Our waiter was so nice and attentive and brought bread very quickly because we were really hungry after a long drive. Friday night has live music and we liked the guy who was there and his playlist of songs. A really nice night.",

    "text": "Went here last night with the whole family (6 ppl).  Arrived to a nearly empty restaurant at 6:30pm.  Ambience: Based on the decor, it seems like they were thinking they were attempting to create a finer dining experience.  However, instead of Italian music, they played alternative pop - the best 'sing along songs' from the past 5 years.  Additionally, they had huge flat screen TVs in all corners, which gave it more of a pseudo-sports bar feel than a fine dining experience.  Service: The server good - friendly and attentive.  No complaints here.  Kept waters filled throughout the night and checked on the table periodically.  Food: Big disappointment.  It seems as though they were afraid to use seasoning in their dishes.  Usually, when trying a new restaurant, if we go around the table and ask everyone how their food was we get a few 'great' and 'really good' responses.  Tonight we had 'ok' and 'not terrible'.  Those aren't the responses I like to hear when spending $50/person.  As a note, we aren't a family that needs really bold flavors in our foods - just properly seasoned food that brings out and enhances the food's flavor.  I had the Prime NY steak.  Cooked properly (medium rare), but absolutely no flavor or seasoning - none.  First time in my life I had to add salt and pepper (and subsequently ask for some drawn butter) to try to add flavor to a Prime piece of meat.  Wife had the halibut.  Cooked properly, but again, no salt or other seasoning, so very lacking in flavor.  Daughter had short ribs - same result.  Lacked seasoning.  Two pasta dishes - one with sausage and one with short ribs.  Again, on the bland side.  Really lacked seasoning.  Side of macaroni and cheese had no flavor at all.  On the positive side, my son's caprese salad with burrata was good, and my daughter got spaghetti squash and she enjoyed that.  Normally, if we have a less than stellar experience we just finish the meal and move on - never to return to that location.  But last night was on the 'bad' side of neutral so we told the server at the end of the meal that it was \"really underwhelming\", with the purpose of just letting her know that the food had no seasoning.  She said that the chef got complaints in the past that the food was over-seasoned and \"maybe he just cut back too much\".  When she returned with the check, she said the manager removed a few items (two side items) for our discontent.  If the manager felt a discount was necessary, I would have expected a table visit to discuss.  Our main purpose of voicing the issues was so they could fix them, not to get 6% removed from our bill.  Overall, a really disappointing experience.",

The 6 of us went for Sunday brunch and couldn't carry on a decent conversation because the volume of the music was so loud. Really??? For brunch?

They always made sure my sangria and water were topped off.   I started off with oysters off the happy hour menu. They were a bit on the small side though. I followed it with washing my palate with red sangria them white sangria. And because it was a girls get together I didn't have a full on meal. But I did try their dooughnuts infused with lemon flavor. I would describe them as crunchy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside. Definitely gotta try them for yourself.",

Also, 1/2 price bottles under $100 on Thursday's, score.   The ambiance was great and the staff made us feel like we were at home!  I went basic with the chicken parm, HUGE portion so come hungry if u try that, or plan to split it. She got the short rib cavatelli, and it was right on the money.   U are always a little skeptical when it's inside the casino, but Stations hit a home run with this place. Will definitely recommend it to friends and can't wait for the patio to open on 3/30 so we can come back and enjoy the weather!",

    "text": "Found out that this place had a half off wine bottles on Thursdays, so I decided tocheck this place out. The atmosphere definitely exceeded my expectations. It was almost like I was somewhere else than Vegas. Although I do wish their outside patio gave a better view than the GV Resort parking lot, the inside was more than pleasing to enjoy the dinner. We were greeted by the hostess right away and guided to our table. Our waitress came to us, and served us, but not too promptly, we had to wait for awhile. Instead, their busser served us water and the waitress asked if we wanted anything else to drink, and did not show up for another 10 minutes. When We got out PG and got some appetizers to start off.  -Beef carpaccio Not the freshest selection of beef, but still pretty good. They did not have balsamic vinaigrette like most of the places do, and had a lighter sauce on it, which was pretty delish as well.  -Arancini Loved the fried balls themselves, but the cheesy risotto underneath with their cheesy sauce was a little too much.  I think they could have balanced it more with some marinara. We asked for lemon, squeezed them on top, the dish was actually a lot more refreshing.  -Buccatini  It gave me a feeling of eating spring pasta with buccatini. The dish was light which is the kind that I like, but nothing really special.  -Clam Linguini A little dry, but yummy. Nothing special either though.  None of their desserts seemed appetizing to us, so we skipped dessert. The waitress extremely annoyed us until the end of the meal. She seemed like she was always on a rush, when the restaurant was half empty, and she only had two more tables to take care else than us. All the other servers seemed to be chill, and attentive to their customers, yet ours only seemed to tell the bussers what to do. Not so professional, but would be back to be served by someone else.",

    "text": "My wife and I had dinner including a mix of items from their happy hour menu and regular menu.  The Caesar salad was excellent, oysters only so-so, bread very good, beef carpaccio perfect, veal picatta very tender and tasty, tiramisu disappointing.  We ordered well drinks from the happy hour menu which were listed at $6.  We ordered them over ice and confirmed with our server that the brands we asked for were in fact part of their well drinks.  The service and speed of food delivery was very good.  The bill came and was over $100, which seemed high and when we reviewed it we saw each drink carried an additional $3 \"rock\" charge.  We asked our waiter, he said it was because we ordered just the liquor over ice.  Hence the \"rock\" charge.  When we went to pay we asked to speak with the manager.  We asked her about the $3 rock charge and were told, they charge that because they pour 50% more liquor if you don't order a mixed drink!???    To be honest, the drinks did not look at all like they were a drink and a half either.  Nowhere on their menu was their \"rock bump\" charge indicated or the alleged reasoning of a 50% greater pour, nor were we told that by the waiter at the time of order, nor when we asked about the additional charge.   We pointed that out to the manager, and her response was,\"I am sorry and will have to talk with the waiter.  Hope you give us another chance.\"  Why would I give this restaurant another chance?  She did not offer to take the rock bump charge off, nor any other incentive to come back.    This is a very deceptive pricing practice.  I caution anyone planning on eating here to be on the look out for other questionable practices by Bottiglia Cucina & Enoteca.  We certainly will not be giving them another opportunity.",

For our appetizers we chose the Eggplant Parmesan & Arancini. AHHHMAZING! The buffalo mozzarella and sauce in the Eggplant Parmesan was delightful (so much so that I had 3-totally worth the calories!). The Arancini was also delicious. Seriously risotto inside a crispy ball of fontina cheese? HEAVEN! We also shared a pitcher of the White & Red Sangria. Both were equally tasty and the flowers added to each glass were a beautiful addition! Now on to my entree: Wild Mushroom Risotto. The plating was so pretty I almost didn't want to dig in-although very glad that I did!  Perfectly cooked risotto coupled with fresh mushrooms. SUPERB! Other members of my party also ordered the Chicken Parmesan, Caesar Salad, Veal Ravioli & a side of Carbonara Mac & Cheese. Nothing but big smiles all around. Now on to the dessert...We had the Dessert Sampler-a plate full of Bottiglia's signature sweets . Oh my goodness, it was TO DIE FOR! Especially the Tiramisu! The espresso flavor was strong but not overpowering. Perfect for a self proclaimed coffee addict. We finished the night with Lemon Drops (that counts as dessert too right?). 10/10, so sweet & so smooth. Such a fun drink! Thank you so much, Bottiglia! Now time to try their wildly popular, Sunday brunch! (YUM!)",

Our server Michel was awesome and super informative about everything on the menu, including specials such as $1 oysters (I had no idea) I was super excited about the oysters! We had the squash blossoms and arancini as starters and they were incredible! For entrees we ordered the short rib pasta, clam pasta, mushroom risotto and my new personal favorite crab bucatini!! Everything was incredible and I seriously can not wait to come back soon!! I will be recommending this place to all my friends and family!!",

My 3 star score is for the awful lobster pasta dish. It was not worth $42 dollars. It sounds much better than it tastes. The pasta wasn't cooked completely and the sauce served was tasty but minimal. It was also cold when it was served to me... not sure if it's supposed to be cold but the menu didn't specify that. I just expected to have the most amazing dish for that price. They should honestly take it off the menu because I wouldn't even want it if it was $20.   The octopus appetizer was delicious. If I could do it again I would just order that twice.   All in all I would only go here if you wanted to eat at a cute place. I wouldn't go back for the food.",

I live close and come here often because I really enjoy the food and atmosphere. Great place to watch the game, plenty of TVs. I sit at the bar everytime. Jennifer is horrible. If you say something to her, she doesn't even acknowledge you. Especially if you're a female. The barback, with the short curly hair is awesome. She's super attentive and cool. She has an actual personality, unlike the bartenders. I worked for Stations Casinos, and I know this is NOT their standard of service.",

Went to the table at 6:30, our waiter Kevin (who was superb!) gave us the happy hour menu and we ordered one of everything on it and then we ordered other items off the main menu. Food was really good (Brian Massie menu so of course it was DELISH!), my fav was the Pesto Bucatini on the \"happy hour\" or \"items to share\" menu (5-7pm). Loved the decor, good place to throw an event, will definitely be back! Thanks again Kevin for the GREAT service!",

You would never know it was just opened, as they seemed to gave the service groove down, even with a fairly full house.  We had the mushroom risotto, and it was fabulous.  Everyone around us also raved about their food.  Bartenders were extremely friendly, and great service.    Atmosphere is wonderful.  A very modern Italian theme.   Half the restaurant is outside, and the connecting wall is full of large doors that can be opened, and thus on nice evenins the whole restaurant is open air.  We will definitely be back.",

Warm welcome from the hostess I asked to sit at the bar since I was alone. Open seating perfect. Greeted quickly by a nice young lady named Tiffany she got me started with a drink and the oysters I wanted. Oysters came they were just as I expected very tasty. The other bartender Alissa now approached me to see how I was doing and if she could get me anything else. I wanted an entree she guided me through the menu and highlighted all the best dishes. Settled on the pork chop! Her favorite dish. It came out in a timely manner and I must say the presentation was flawless! Cooked perfect totally tender and juicy. Literally the perfect dish I was looking for. I destroyed all 16oz with ease because it was just too good to stop. But there is more I figured since I was on such a hot streak I would let Alissa select a dessert for me... bam she hit out of the park again. The tiramisu at bottiglia is one of the best I've ever had. Classic dish done right with a little twist! Overall this was a great meal. Wonderful service from both ladies. Great recommendations. Annnnnnd it wasn't over priced even though it was in a casino!!  I will probably be back in 2 weeks to try out some more dishes!",

I didn't care for the placement of the TV's around the restaurant which in my opinion took away from the ambiance in the dining area.   The Foccacia bread with balsamic vinegar and olive oil was tasty- 4stars The balsamic vinegar was the sweetest I have ever tasted and make up for the lack of freshness with the bread.  Fried Calamari- Great appetizer, had slices of fried pepperchini's a nice twist. Two dipping sauces- marinara and an orange mayo based one- 4 stars  Sadly both my friend and I were very disappointed the King crab buccatini was just ok. Didn't look anything like photos posted on yelp. The biggest detractors were the price and there was hardly any crab. Some pasta and lemon sauce, definitely not worthy $44!! Hence the 3 stars My other friends ordered the Scallop special and Salmon and although both said they were ok/good they were not impressed with the small entrees. On a positive note the side dishes of Parmesan creamed spinach and crispy Brussel sprouts were good- 4 stars",

It seems like a better place to get drinks and appetizers instead of dinner.   First of all, I did like the ambiance and feel of the place. It was so modern and hipster. It was a comfortable place to dine or get drinks. It also wasn't freezing inside which is another bonus since I hate being cold in restaurants.   For the food.  I was so stoked they had Cacio E Pepe on the menu, no doubt I was going to order it. I had eaten it all over Rome a year ago and fell in love with that dish. What I got was not traditional, authentic cacio e Pepe. For one it had no pepper! Pepe(pepper) is in the name. Also, it was drenched in sauce and the noodles were not the correct ones for the dish. It tasted good but I was disappointed. For the Burrata appetizer, it was good but tasted like something was missing. The other pasta dish was soaked in sauce as well. The food tasted good but just had a few issues. The bread at the beginning was nice and crusty on the outside and soft on the inside. It came with a little cup of olive oil and balsamic.   The service was one excellent thing. They were always so quick to take our order and bring our food/drinks.",

The service was outstanding but we had to send the oysters back as they has a bad taste.  The manager came over, apologized, he tried one and confirmed they had a bad taste, and removed it from our bill.  My advice to the management is to keep a close eye on the handling and aging of the oysters and those that prepare them. All they had to do was smell them.  It seems that the kitchen staff does not do this.  Surprising.  The rest of the food was outstanding!  I was impressed.  Will be back to try the oysters one more time.",

    "text": "After seeing numerous yelp reviews about the pasta and pictures of the pretty venue I decided to make a reservation. 1) The hostess' attire was extremely unprofessional (this is coming from a fashion loving individual) the dress barely reaching fingertip length plus high heels totally calls for disaster. I'm not one to say wear a dress to your ankles but you get the idea   Our waitress Jenna was SO nice!!! She was very bubbly and gave us an insight on what drinks were popular etc.   While we were waiting for our drinks... a little longer than usual Jenna noticed and said she'd check, however we were sitting parallel to the bar and  2) The bartender lady was constantly talking rather than making the drinks. It's like as if every glance I made a couple of minutes she was still talking! And when she made the drinks with the shaker she was absolutely listless instead of shaking that thing till her fingers were numb from the coldness.   My wild mushroom pasta however, hats off for that! It was so incredibly yummy, I wouldn't mind eating it for the rest of the week. My mom had the veal and she really enjoyed it as well. We got the mozzarella as appetizer and while it was good it was just a huge block so... presentation could've been better :/  finished with some NY Cheesecake which you can never complain about. I'd come back if I was having pasta cravings ;)   P.S. - the beautiful venue totally got destroyed with the TV's... but I guess sports are the way to go and it would've been better with some nice Italian music rather then today's top hits BUT that's just me being picky",

Tonight we experienced a rare occasion where our dining experience did not start off fantastic (details not required) but really do need to acknowledge the stellar recovery by both the Manager Matt and our wonderful server Mackenzie.

My husband and I have a lot of dietary restrictions and they were so accommodating. The servers were so knowledgable on the menu.   We were so impressed with this place we decided to have our rehearsal dinner here. They have a gorgeous private dining area in the back, and it was able to fit 30 people comfortably. The manager Mary was AMAZING!!!!!! She made sure everything was perfect so I could just enjoy my night. The food is to die for!!!!! You have to try the Zucchini Flowers and the Arancini, seriously awesome!! You have to check this place out!! They do brunch here as well and it's so delicious!!! Can't wait for my next date night!",

Immediately upon walking in, we were impressed with the decor and overall feel of this new Italian restaurant.   Food: being dairy free/ mostly plant based I'm always sketchy about Italian restaurants with lots of cheesy and meaty options. Luckily I was able to get their vegan Bologese which was delicious with chickpeas and almond ricotta. My husband has the veal Marsala which was good. It would've been nice to have a pasta side included with the veal, as it was only three small pieces of meat and mushrooms. The desert sampler was good; I did dive into the poppyseed donuts dairy or not. I could swim in the strawberry puree sauce!   Ambiance: the decor is very homey in the Bottiglia! It's super crisp and clean with beautiful accents.   Service: the food runners were amazing and quick but our server wasn't the most amazing server I've ever had. She didn't find my little jokes funny at all and was just so-so.  We will probably be back to try a themed night or day since there are items I would like to try still!",

Show up at 7:50pm, tell the host that we have reservations, they make us wait in the front for 25 minutes while they \"set up our table\". Proceeded to seat 3 separate groups of walk-ins (groups of 2) that showed up after us. When they finally take us to our table it was a small table meant for 4 that they tried to squeeze us into. This place was not even close to being at full capacity, and in fact there was a large round 6 person table nearby so we asked them if we could have that table instead. 15 minutes later the host returns and tells us we can take the larger table. Very, very sloppy hosting - not sure what the point of making a reservation is if it's going to lead to worse service than just walking in.  However giving it 2 stars because, poor start to the evening aside, the food was delicious and our server was great.",

Other than the seafood platter which is delicious, the rest of the dishes taste nothing like food you would get in Italy. Many pasta dishes have bizarre overwhelming flavours that mask the taste of the primary ingredients. Sauces appear to have sat around for a while under a heat lamp. Hot dishes are served tepid at best. And this visit left me with an upset stomach. Needs an overhaul to achieve its potential.",

In regard to food ordered, I wish I had more pics to show but everyone has done such fine work featuring the King Crab Bucatini, so I walked in expecting my order prior to arrival. I also asked the bartender for a recommendation (just in case) and she suggested the pasta I already had in mind! The dish itself had large chunks of crab but the best thing about it was the meyer lemon cream sauce.... I enjoyed every bite.  Side note: they honored the free glass of wine as advertised with your choice of their house red or white. I went with red and it's good enough.",

She gave me some suggestions on the Happy hr. Drink selections. I chose the Fresca fizz I liked it and it was quite a powerful drink. We ordered the meatballs and the Arancini both good the meatballs weren't really hot they were warm. The sauce was a pleasant surprise thick rich and flavorful. This is where my love for Bottiglias food ended. We left the bar our hostess seated us in Alexis's section she was also very nice and attentive. We ordered the Caesar salads way to dry. My husband finished mine. While we were at the bar Sarah did recommend the crab bucatini our waitress agreed so that's what my husband ordered. I ordered the mushroom tagliatelle in the black truffle cream sauce. It was just too rich for me and something was missing I added pepper but meh not sure what was wrong. I got through half. My husband does not like truffles so I didn't bother bringing it home.  The crab bucatini had a nice flavor but the pasta was a bit to al dente. I do think we will come back the service was good,close to home and I really like the meatballs and gravy/sauce. I think if we do return I'd like to try the bolognese. This place has been at least 3 different restaurants if not more. So I'm hoping I just chose an entree that was too rich and a salad that needed a bit more dressing.",

I don't know who designed this place but its amazing. I can only describe it as a light & bright Italian country home. From the gorgeous floor to the tables and chairs its really beautiful and you will soon forget your at a casino. The open kitchen is also a nice feature.   I ordered my free glass of wine with Yelp check in and it was delivered with a  nice selection of bread and homemade honey butter. Our waiter Raul was very knowledgable about the dishes and how they are prepared.   We ordered the meat and cheese board, arancini and the meatballs. Like their neighbor Borracha all HH food and drinks are $6.   The meat and cheese plate came out first with prosciutto, salami, a wonderful cheese (sorry forgot the name) and this incredible apricot spread that was served with crispy bread. Well worth the $6. Next was the arancini which was served on a marinara sauce. Filled with melted cheese they were good, but nothing spectacular. The meatballs came out next, again served with a marinara sauce and melted cheese. Like the arancini they were good but I much prefer the meatballs at pizza rock.   Bottiglia has a desert menu with five selections. We chose the chocolate caprese cake. It was presently very nicely with a large dollop of hazelnut whipped cream and colorful flower petals. The cake itself was rich, dense and delicious.   The service was casual and friendly with minimal time between courses. A definite add to my HH list!   With four great happy hour options at GVR I am really pleased with the latest addition of Bottiglia.",

    "text": "As soon as you walk through the casino's double doors, you are transported with delight to Bottiglia in South Hampton decor and will easily and momentarily forget you're at a local Station casino in Henderson, Nevada.   Restaurant entrance is to the far east side of the Green Valley Ranch Casino. There's parking right outside or you can park in the garage. I recommend parking outside because you get direct access to the restaurant instead of having to walk through the casino.   The restaurant decor is light and very South Hampton. It definitely appeals to the feminine taste.   Twice I have been here and I enjoyed both times enormously. I seriously think everything on the menu may be excellent but I haven't tried everything so here's are a few items of note:   Zucchini flowers - perfectly breaded and deep fried with soft cheese (not the plastic stringy kind) oozing out. Don't let the deep fried thing fool you because it was not heavy at all.   Grilled octopus - with a squeeze of lemon and it's more tender than you think it's normal. That's actually exactly what my dining companion commented. So tender and not at all chewy; could it be tenderizer? (I don't even know if you can put tenderizer on octopus...)   Short rub cavatelli - it's almost like a ragu but better! The short rib was shredded and cooked with the ragu and then tossed with perfectly al dente cavatelli. Then garnished with small dollops of cheese. It was the heaviest dish of the evening but so good!   Pork chop - Perfectly cooked so it wasn't though. The sliced pork chop sat on top of a plate of green and tapioca-looking pasta. The pork chop was topped with diced fresh apples. You can never go wrong with pork chop and apples but this was beyond expectations and dining excellent.   Tiramisu - my personal favorite! Served in a little Mason jar with shaved chocolate on top, I could just eat that for dinner! You can tell they use amaretto and it was so delicious. Not heavy at all and leaving your lips all greasy and slick. It was also served with two lemon shortbread cookies dipped in chocolate. Those didn't do much for me but maybe it's because I make better shortbread cookies than that so I may be biased.   Service is good. You can tell they really try to make this a positive experience for you, so that's noteworthy. This may not be an issue to most people but it is important to note that the bathroom is right by the hostess stand with the door marked \"il bagno\". It's a unisex bathroom with private stalls and a common washing area. The first time I used it there was a gentleman washing his hands next to me and I kept thinking I went into the wrong restroom. Going to take some getting used to.   I will definitely come here again and hopefully more often.",

I had the spaghetti squash again and this time tried the grilled octopus which was amazing. All of the appetizers we had were delicious.

I tend not to mind if they check on us and mention something about the delay, but they said nothing. They seemed very accommodating to our requests, which was nice. I had the Pan Seared Halibut which arrived a bit over, not seasoned well with burnt edges. The description says that it contained peas but I ordered a vegetable side dish anyway cuz I joked with my friend that there were probably only 3 peas that would appear on my plate as decoration...when it arrived there were exactly three peas on my plate so we both shared a good laugh. The farro risotto and carrot puree were good, but more puree would have been amazing. The asparagus was a bit thick and not all that well cooked. They refilled our water glasses pretty regularly but one busser filled up every glass on the table but mine, which was odd. I liked the decor and how very nice and accommodating everyone was. It wasn't necessarily a bad meal, just not all that memorable.",

    "text": "Over the years I've wished that GVR would get more restaurants since the location is so convenient and finally it's happening. Bottiglia isn't just a restaurant, it's a great restaurant.   Reservations seem to be a must. Our first attempt to come here was without a reservation and they were booked for the entire evening. This time I made a reservation on Open Table for a 6:00 dinner. The restaurant was pretty full this time as well.  The restaurant is bright and cheery. It's much more open than the last Italian restaurant that was in this spot. The restaurant is beautifully decorating and very inviting. Next to the hostess stand there are couches for lounge seating, a large bar, tables, booths, and two outdoor patios with seating. In the back there is a private room that can seat a large group.   We were brought the bread board to start. The parmesan crisp and olive bread were my favorite. The lemon honey butter served with the bread was delicious. The presentation of the bread was nice. I ordered a Red Sangria which had a nice flavor and wasn't overly sweet. It was a measly portion for $12 so I'd pass on this next time.   Before our meal we shared a Caesar Salad and Meatballs. The Caesar Salad dressing tasted homemade. The meatballs were good, but could have used some more seasoning and the marinara sauce was well flavored. I liked the fresh mozzarella with the meatballs.   For dinner I ordered Chicken Parmesan and my husband ordered Short Rib Cavatelli. The Chicken Parmesan was delicious and tender enough to cut with a fork. The sauce was delicious and the cheese on top was the perfect amount. My husband's Short Rib Cavatelli was delicious as well. The sauce on it was great and the short rib was in large, tender pieces in the pasta. I loved the whipped lemon ricotta in the dish which sent it over the top. My husband and I ordered one pasta dish and one meat dish on purpose so that we could share with each other since the chicken doesn't come with any sides. Sides can be ordered a la carte, but given the size of entrees that would be an excessive amount of food.  Dessert is a must here. When I first looked at the dessert menu I was not that intrigued by any one item, but I'm not one to pass on dessert. The Dessert Sampler seemed like a good item for my husband and I to share so we went with that option. Everything on the sampler was amazing and it was a very good deal for the amount of dessert. The Tiramisu was one of best I've ever had with a lovely flavor. The Strawberry Limoncello Pannacotta was the best item with plenty of lemon zest, strawberries, and a to do for strawberry compote. The donuts were light and perfectly textured with a nice lemon curd. As if that wasn't enough there were two delicious chocolate dipped shortbread cookies. Everything on the plate was a great dessert.  The thing that most worried me about trying this restaurant was the service. We've had terrible experiences with service at Hank's and we were worried that it was a GVR curse. Not at all. Our waiter was attentive, water glasses were continuously filled, and all of our food came out in a well timed manner. Our waiter did get more tables as were wrapping up so it took a little time to get our check, but he apologized without us saying anything. So, based on our experience I don't have any concerns about the service.  There is only one thing that detracted from the experience for me and it will be a deal breaker if it wasn't a one-off. Nobody else has mentioned it so hopefully it was a one-off. When we first arrived the music was at a reasonable volume. About 30 minutes later they turned it up so loud that my husband and I were screaming to talk to each other. When the live musician arrived it didn't get any better. This restaurant just doesn't seem like the proper venue for music that loud.  Overall, I absolutely loved the food, service, and design of the restaurant.",

When first arriving there is an open waiting area furnished with low seating couches and chairs next to the bar. The overall feel of the resturant is modern upscale yet cozy and welcoming.   For food I enjoyed a charcuterie board consisting of pecorino and teahive cheeses accompanied by prosciutto and picante meats along with the calamari as an appetizer. The meat and cheese is all freshly shaven and served with a side of truffle honey and when the honey is spooned onto the cheese it makes for a mouthful of sweet and savory flavor. The calamari was perfectly cooked and seasoned well. It had a slight kick of spice and the end of each bite which I quiet enjoyed.  For entrees I tried the chicken parm and the rigatoni sausage. The chicken parm was a huge portion and I definitely got my money's worth. The crispy outside was the perfect transition to the juicy center which always left you wanting another bite. The chicken parm was served with a San Marzano tomato sauce which was light and fresh as if it came direct from Italy. The rigatoni was cooked perfectly and paired well with the fresh sausage. I requested the dish spicy since I am a fan of spice and I was not let down. The heat from each bite lingered in my mouth but it was not overpowering rather it left you wanting more and more.   For dessert I had the panna cotta with fresh strawberries and a berry sauce. The creaminess and sweetness of the panna cotta was balanced out by the tart yet sweet berry sauce. If you are looking for a nice night out with your significant other then bottiglia is the best choice",

They had a live dj playing music, and although it was Sunday it wasn't too busy. Everyone was dressed very well and I loved both the hostess and our server. They were extremely nice!  We ordered a couple cocktails, I got the \"endless summer\" which is amazing! For food we got the Caesar salad and the chicken panini with truffle fries. They food was delicious, but the best part were definitely the drinks.  I had the best Sunday brunch here and will most likely be returning! I also noticed they have a really nice private dining room, and a BEAUTIFUL patio area perfect for large groups. Checking out their dinner menu for sure next time!",

Not the traditional Italian ambiance I am use too. But, a very modern appeal. The service was great no complaints there. This restaurant is located inside a casino so it didn't surprise us that the menu was pricey starting at $17 and up. And everything is a la cart, I ordered eggplant parmigiana very disappointed for the price my local pizza place makes a better eggplant. Then came chicken Marsala for my husband mind you he loves to eat the dish had 3 thin slices of chicken barely enough. He order pasta extra money on the side or he would have left hungry. The rest of my family dishes were meh. The dessert however were wonderful. When we all get together we like leaving a place with a feeling of WOW!  I'm definitely going back. Especially after getting a bill for $450.00. But, not this place. That was our first and last visit.",

When you walk in (especially if you don't walk in from the Casino) it doesn't even feel like you're in Las Vegas!   That being said, the food here was average for the price. My boyfriend and I came for brunch and had the lox and bagel (3.5/5), an omelet (2/5, serving sizes were small), and bread pudding which was the best thing that we tried. Presentation of the food was beautiful, but we both had the most terrible upset stomach after we left! So disappointing because we really wanted to love the restaurant due to it's beautiful ambiance and location.",

We're in love with the shrimp puttanesca pasta, and have also tried the bollognese, which was good but slightly less flavorful. Happy hour is a great deal and there are some good appetizer choices. We just can't help but order the pasta though! They also have some nice specialty cocktails.  We're going to try the fish next time. And the mushroom risotto. Both look extraordinary.   The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is our service was a slow and scattered the first visit. Second visit was better. I'll update it as we continue to try it out.",

I checked in and received a free glass of wine. It took a bit of time for us to get our drinks which is understandable, being that it was 6:30 on a Saturday night. We ordered the fried risotto, I've had this before and it was amazing, however this time it came out and was a little warmer than room temperature, so I wouldn't say it was as good as last time. I ordered a chicken Caesar salad. After the first bite i took, I pulled a somewhat large chicken bone from my mouth. I had the waitress come over and she took it to the back to show the cooks. She never came back to speak with me about it, never asked if she could get me anything else. The rest of our party was unimpressed by the food. We were told when our bill came, that she took off 20% because of the chicken bone. To sum it up our experience-Service was not good, food was not good... and none of us will be returning.",

I came to visit a girlfriend who lives in Las Vegas and she recommended the place (yet I'M the foodie and usually pick all the spots). I was really really impressed by the way that they pulled off the decor. It's quite modern (think Miami) meets countryside (think somewhere in the south that's not Florida?) and the vibe was awesome. I usually wouldn't be a fan of mixing such different styles but I loved it.   Must order + Wild mushroom risotto - my weakness + Calamari - big portion + Branzino  + Octopus  My girlfriend said that the chicken parm was on \"another planet\" level of good.  I really loved the overall vibe of the place and the food was shockingly good. It also helps that I had quite a few cocktails as well! I have a stomach issue and they were more than accommodating of my issues and found a drink that was light/not acidic. Usually bartenders think it is such a hassle to have to accommodate someone but it was refreshing to not be penalized for making a special request.  Will def go back the next time I'm in town...

Our server Heidi clearly didn't care about providing any kind of service - we were a party of 6 and she never refilled drinks, never checked to see if everything was okay after we got our food, and really wasn't even present except to take our order and drop off the check. She tacked on auto-gratuity which kind of explained why her service sucked so bad. So it was hard to really enjoy our food or even remember if it even tastes good because of horrible service - or lack of service. If anyone decides to dine here and you see that your server is Heidi and/or if you're a party of at least 6, don't expect her to go the extra mile or even show her face more than once or twice, since in her mind, she's already earned her tips.",

Our server barely came by to check on how we were doing, our busser never really understood how to clear the table where as not to disturb our conversation. We order an array of food and my top choices were the calamari, tomato bisque and bucatini. Everything else we ordered such as: braised short rib, char-grilled octopus, hanger steak, and beet salad were mediocre the descriptions sounded more flavorful then the actual food. It was not my best experience at a restaurant and at least I can say I tried it.",

Our chicken parm and picatta were both salty. Strike one ! Brought a bottle of Duckhorn wine which I was told it was $20 corkage at Bella, but Bottiglia charges $35 corkage fee. Strike two ! The entrees are al carte so an extra side of pasta, which other restaurants include free with entrees, are $8 more. Strike three ! Salads are expensive at $12. Better value Italian restaurants around town than this one. I would have given it a one star rating but our server, Kevin, was great. He deserved a 25%+ tip. Sorry Stations, but your Italian restaurants have gone down hill. Like the one at Texas Station. You once had the best antipasto salad but new chef decided to cut it off the menu. We never went back and won't be back here either.",

A random server came and gave us menus and said that our server would be with us in a moment. After a long wait, he came by and took our drink orders. After ANOTHER long wait, he came and explained the menu. By then, we were already very ready to order.   The calamari was a large portion and was very good. The arancini was also delicious. Unfortunately, 3 out of 5 of the entree pastas we ordered were extremely salty. So salty that it was difficult to eat. Made me wish I got the gnocchi because that was delicious on my first visit.   Another extremely long wait for the server to come by and ask if we wanted dessert. By then, it was definitely time to leave. Mind you, the place was empty; maybe 5 or 6 tables in the whole restaurant. Although the server was nice and apologized in the beginning, the service did not get any better throughout the night. No water refills, no checking in on us, and we were offered cheese for our pasta when we were already halfway through our meals. We were constantly ignored and felt uncomfortable with the unprofessionalism of the situation. I won't be back.",

Finally he sold me on their butternut squash gnocchi and it was probably one of the best dishes I've had in awhile. Definitely coming back here for dinner.",

I had the Halibut which did not impress me at all for a 35 dollar plate. I gave 2 stars 1 for decor, and 1 for my cocktail which they didn't skimp out on the vodka. The 2 hostesses were snooty, and our waitress Heidi was attentive at first but disappeared until we were all done with our food, then she apologized repeatedly, we decided to have dessert elsewhere.",

Food was good, and fresh but I think they are still trying to get their act together. Items were put on our bill that we didn't order, it took 45 minutes for our appetizers to come, another 30 minutes to get our bill so we were there for 3 hours just to have one drink and a few appetizers. The biggest complaint I had was the bill!! I had a Dewars and it was $15. I normally pay $6 anywhere else. There were 4 choices of appetizers for happy hour, non of which I liked so ordered from the menu and payed $14 for caprese salad. Way too expensive and way too slow. Might try again in a year if they are still there. Waiter very friendly.",

If you have the pleasure of having her as your server, take her up on her knowledge of the menu.  We had the braised short ribs which was out of this world delicious. The ricotta dumplings were exceptional!! We also had the wood fire NY steak. It was absolutely amazing. Melts in the mouth.  I started with a drink recommend by Heidi. It had a sorbet ice cream in it. Lovely, light and refreshing drink especially for a hot summer Vegas night. I finished with a chocolate and coffee drink which was just as tasty.  We were full but managed to squeeze in a slice of their NY cheesecake. Wow, we finished it. Another great recommendation of Heidi's. So good and worth every calorie.  If your in the neighborhood and hungry, I highly recommend this place. You won't be disappointed!!",

    "text": "Hello and welcome to Bottiglia Cucina & Enoteca. This excellent restaurant is nestled into Green Valley Ranch on the south side of the hotel next to the parking lot. This is a Brian Massie, Click Hospitality venture so we had high hopes. (not disappointed) It was quite busy and we were seated promptly. Seated back by the kitchen area we had a great view of the kitchen and the expedite pass. The head chef was at the pass the whole time and it was nice to see kitchen in action. They offer bar seating overlooking the kitchen and we were told that when you do this there is a special chef service.  We arrived toward end of happy hour where beer and appetizers where discounted. I will say that service was prompt once seated and drink orders were taken. Appetizers we ordered the Wood Roasted Eggplant Spread and the Cheese and Salami Board. he spread had a sweat smoky taste and with the toasted garlic bread added extra zest to the overall bite. The cheese and salami spread was quite nice however at this moment I can't recall the names of the meat or cheeses, but they were good.  Dinner, josie had the Pappardelle Bolognese. This was at suggestion of our waitress who was quite informed on the menu and taste profile of our dishes. The bolognese was very meaty and the Pappardelle is the only pasta that is hand made there at the restaurant. I had the Wood Roasted Pork Chop. Very tender and cooked perfectly medium as requested. Chop sat on a bed of Tuscan Kale with apples and pickled mustard seeds. We got a side of the Carbonara, Mac & Cheese. This Mac n Cheese was pretty amazing, and I am hard to please with Mac n Cheese. Peas, Parm and guanciale. Guancialle; an Italian cured meat taken from the pork jowl or cheek. This added so much to the profile of the Mac. Think using pancetta but better. Great dinner course and the whole time the wait staff was attentive. Of coarse we had dessert. This jar of Tar Tiramisu layered in a jar topped with chocolate shavings. I had custard filled Doughnut holes with a red wine jam. Both were an excellent end to a delicious meal. Thank you for dining at Bottiglia Cucina & Enoteca. We will most definitely go here again. The staff was great food amazing. overall a great dining experience.  If you are in GVR and looking for a great meal please check this place out.",

He kept giving me drinks and before you know it I was feeling great, had to leave him a solid tip after all the drinks but he was worth it. I'd go back to experience his service. Ordered a king crab bucatini, that shit was good, side note my server recommended it and I'm glad he did. I can see me spending money there again, hopefully that Zack guy is working again, he made the experience worth it.",

We opted to sit on the patio- the weather was beautiful and the football game was on. Ok so what we all like was the ambiance, the outdoor furniture was very comfortable. What we all thought needed a complete turnaround- Service- we had to ask for silverware, napkins. After the waitress walked about to other tables we finally got them. We had to ask for refills on our water and iced teas got those about 10 minutes later and it wasn't just our table the other tables in our outdoor section had to repeatedly ask for things that SHOULD have already been on the table. We finally put our order in( remember reservations were for 6 & we were early) we waited an entire hour and 15 minutes before our food came!!!! And the lady could not even make sure the the bread we chowed down of while waiting was refilled. We had to ask another waitress in passing for bread who looked like she couldn't be bothered because \"we weren't her table\" When the food finally arrived my braised short ribs were so TOUGH  I could not eat them all there were 4 on the plate I could eat 1. My guy's father order the Veal Marsala which came as just a plate of meat, Being that was our first time neither of us knew that the meat entree came with no veg. but for the prices that the charge you should well have at least 2 vegetable choices. We seem to have struck up a little friendship with the people in our section and all were not happy with the service. We will never go back even if they offer free meals.",

Still, there were some more lengthy waits, like for the check. Our waitress still didn't seem particularly sincere but she was friendly enough. My husband's water went unfilled for most of the meal. And no one ever asked if we wanted fresh pepper on our salads, cheese on our pasta, or more bread so we had to ask. I think it's in the details that things are getting lost here.  I think the atmosphere is beautiful, minus the TVs. Convenient location too.  Update: We returned last night after being away for a few months. Service was great, still missed a few details, but the food was bland and unremarkable. No seasoning, heavy on the flour for the calamari, and salads were bland. This seals the deal...been there about six times now and it's completely inconsistent. Likely won't return.",

Menu seems to be basic dishes made a little fancier. Don't expect alfredo, pesto, etc... wine and red meat sauces here only it appears. Wine selection seems good. They had a sangria drink that my wife got that was pretty tasty. Oh, and of note: they do not have gelato which was a bit surprising and a little bit of a bummer...",

This restaurant's main issue is service.  It took us about 10 minutes for our server, Gerald, to greet us, and he seemed like he was rushed each time he spoke with us.  He also oddly kept giving us items 'on him' such as two bottles of Evian water and coffees at the end of our meal.  I think maybe he thought it would change our impression of him if he added in free items, but it certainly did not.  All we wanted was great service and an overall great dining experience--which was not the case.   I will ONLY be visiting this restaurant again if I sit at the bar.",

Our server was Raul and he was very attentive to our needs, always making sure our drinks were filled and table was cleared for the next round of apps/entrees. Raul was very knowledgeable about the menu and was very helpful in helping me to pick out some yummy drinks like the Bellini (one of my favs). We started with several appetizers that were sent out ((Thanks Mary & Chef Josh))!! The calamari was sooo good & crisp I am going to order every time! For entrees I split the bucatini (I recommend adding shrimp!) with one of my friends and it was perfect size for us since we filled up on the apps. My friends bought a nothing bundt cake for me & Raul had it cut & brought it out to me with candles and sang! Thank you Bottiglia for celebrating with me!!! Can't wait to do it again!",

Additionally we had to ask the manager three  times to turn the music down so we could have a normal conversation with our dinner companions.I also did not appreciate having to share the bathroom with male guests. I don't care if that is customary in Europe- it was very uncomfortable. The coffee with dessert was cold and when we asked the waiter about getting hot coffee, he was not very agreeable about it and we never did get fresh, hot coffee. They also seem very disorganized, even though the wait staff seem helpful, it appears no one is in control of the chaos there.",

I generally like beet salads with goat cheese and they used blue cheese which is still good but it needed a little more to me. The salad was a little to sweet.   Short rib cavatelli - this dish was excellent. It was recommend from our waiter. The ricotta on the sides made it even better.   King crab bucatini - was very good. It is more lemons tasting so you don't have to much cream here in the sauce. Full pieces of crab inside the pasta.   It was our anniversary and so they gave us a free tiramisu which was good. Wasn't the best I ever had but it was very good. Very chocolately tasting.   On in all I loved this place and I will be back.",

OMG, it was literately dunk in SALT. He couldn't too much because it was WAY TOO SALTY!!!  So, he ate 1/2 of my daughter's dinner which was veal. I only had a small bite of it. (I only had skin rash on my leg).  We paid over $150 just on dinner, no desert nor drinks, but what a horrible experience!!!  Pasta that's was so SALTY that we couldn't eat and to suffer all night and next day running to bathroom!!!  We're so disappointed. IT WAS A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!",

We got on the happy hour menu, the beef carpaccio, tomato soup with grilled cheese and prosciutto and a charcuterie board. The plates were smaller than I thought they would be and what the pictures show. The beef carpaccio was delicious and a little sour once you mix the lemon and arugula. Tomato soup was not bad a little on the cold side but the grilled cheese was different, the bread had a sweet taste to It. The cheese board was phenomenal I love prosciutto and salami, I also think they had truffle cheese and they all mixed well together. For the main dish I opted for a linguine with clam and king crab pasta. The dishes were smaller than a normal dinner size but they were hot and tasted as I thought they would. It wasn't spectacular but wasn't bad, I might come back for happy hour and their cheese board! They have also been advertising 1/2 off all pastas in November and have the same pasta on every billboard BUT they don't offer the pasta they are advertising. Disappointing.",

My favorites are hands down the grilled octopus appetizer with black garlic yogurt sauce. Has great flavor of the grill and the tender octopus with the crispy potatoes underneath and that amazing sauce is really something. Even non octopus lovers can't help but enjoy it. Then my next favorite is their tiramisu. I used to believe it wasn't possible to find top shelf tiramisu outside NYC but Bottiglia's might be better than any I've ever had even in New York. Just really unique, flavorful with great textural complexity that you don't typically find in a run of the mill tiramisu.   Other favorites include their hangar steak. Delicious. The brunch menu has an amazing granola dish that is really tasty and enjoyable. Followed by their amazing corned beef hash with tomatillo sauce (incredibly good). Pair that with some of the best tasting coffee you will find in Las Vegas and you'll have a winner brunch. The staff is always great (although they've had a lot of turnover I've noticed in their first year). Jeremy has become the new guy at brunch on weekends and does a great job taking care of me.   Lastly, I would be remiss if I didnt mention that it's one of the most beautifully appointed restaurants in all of Las Vegas. Off the strip, it has no real competition in that category. There is almost no where in Henderson that has outdoor seating in a classy upscale environment with top shelf food and service. It's a unique place and hopefully the first of many more like it in Henderson, where the culinary scene is badly lagging behind for a city that size.",

We got the free glass of wine with the Yelp check in, which the food server quickly brought to the table.   Food: Antipasti: Arancini - creamy inside, crispy outside and served with a delicious bolognese. Calamari - nothing spectacular. Sides: Macaroni and cheese - amazing! I could've eaten only that and been absolutely in love. Entree: Braised Short Ribs - beautifully plated, fork tender. Not super flavorful,  but not bland either. The spinach ricotta dumplings were bite sized (comes with two) and not really memorable.  And as random as this sounds, I do not know what was in the butter that comes with the bread basket,  but I need more of that in my life.   Food service: Great! Attentive server. I think his name was Kobi (sp?) Our water and wine glasses were never empty. Finished plates were cleared promptly. New silverware brought out with each course.   I would definitely try this place again if ever in Henderson again. If for nothing else on the menu, but the macaroni and cheese.",

Walking into the restaurant transports you out of the dated Green Valley Ranch and into a chic and colorful world. The high chairs are a bit hard at first to get in, but once you're seated they promise an elevated dining experience.  I could tell our server had in-depth knowledge of the food and drink menus, although he was young I was impressed. It's rare to see proper bottle service at a Henderson restaurant. We went with a classic Brunello Montecino. Absolutely delightful. Our server Kobe even decanted the wine without us asking.  I chose a a meat dish , as did the rest of my group. Veal Parmesans and also some chicken dish I can't seem to recall the name of. They were wonderful, and the squash side is a must! That's Italian  for you though.",

We were seated in a 4-too by the entrance to one of the private rooms in the back corner. This was annoying as the difference in air pressure kept a constant flow of air blowing out of the door cracks onto our seat, additionally, this was the only way in/out of the room for guests and staff. It was right next to my chair, not even in between two different tables... We ordered the chopped salad - delicious, the arancini - rice and cheese deep fried, but the Bolognese sauce with it was great, the Wild Mushroom Pasta was amazing but very rich, the Farro risotto was not that good, chicken picatta was decent. Portions were OK for pricing. It's in a resort and spa after all....",

This restaurant served us a big bowl of sauce with a few rigatoni noodles in it, the noodles were over cooked and the meatballs that we added to the dish were disgusting. By far the worst Italian dinner I have had in 47 years. We wont go back. Don't waste your time or money!",

My only complaint was that the hostess were awful. They didn't acknowledge me at all when i walked in and when i was wondering through the restaurant searching for my family. And when trying to see what tables are available for other customers, they have no regard for seated guests and personal space. Luckily they're a very small part of the experience so I'll be returning for a date night!",

    "text": "Such a pretty restaurant inside Green Valley! Bottiglia's light colors and soft lighting are a nice retreat from the low lit, garish decor of many a casino restaurant in Las Vegas. Beyond the airy decor at first glance, diners sit at shabby chic tables/couches/chairs, which gives the overall vibe that you're at a friend's beach house.  Just like the restaurant vibe, menu offerings aren't heavy or overbearing. Rustic Italian cuisine tends to be not to sauce heavy and there's plenty of easy breezy beverage options too. Whether you order the squash blossoms, burratta, or pasta dish, it'll be a nice sized portion but not gut busting or overdoing it. Might I also note that the branzino comes out deboned and without the questionable? It's all about the pretty aesthetics at Bottiglia.  Dinner for five with wine, appetizers, mains, and dessert came out to about $400 total. Had I taken advantage of the Yelp Check In offers, it would've been significantly less. Dang it, forgot to tell our server. But that just means I'll be going back when in Vegas again?",

My cousin suggested to check out this place, after hearing about their November half off pasta deal, and I am so glad she made us the reservation.   Came here on a Tuesday, which was a double deal since they're oysters were only a dollar(which is every Tuesday btw). AND LET ME TELL YOU, one of the best oysters I've ever had! It didn't even need the extra sauces it came with on the side. Our group ordered a total of 26, and if we didn't have more food coming, I would've devoured another 26 all to myself! We also had the calamari, which was a little too salty, but I liked the crunchiness to the breading! And they also give you a platter of bread while you wait for your food, which i didn't care too much for since we had other, greater options, but I will say their butter is good! Very light and slightly melted, and a lemony taste.   I had the king crab pasta and my boyfriend had the short rib with spaghetti pasta.  And yet another \"let me tell you moment\".. LET ME TELL YOU, their pasta is AMAZING - more especially the king crab one! Probably the best pasta I've had. Had the perfect texture, the perfect flavor (a light lemon flavor - which wasn't overpowering at all, and the perfect amount crab! The short rib was inferior out of the two, but still delicious. The short rib was very tender, and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente, but I didn't like the sauce all too much, which was tomato based.   Service was good! Our waters were constantly filled, our server was friendly, the hostesses were friendly and took great photos of us when asked!  The only thing that knocked off a star was the wait?  We were sat about 12 minutes after our reservation time, which isn't long but I promise you, it makes the wait worth it if you just be a little honest with not having the table ready on time.  I will definitely come back for their oysters! Oh! And checking in gives you a free glass of wine,  cheers!",

Definitely returning for another visit.",

They have indoor, outdoor, and bar seating making the place a pretty big spot. The waiter was amazing and went thru everything as it was my first time there.   They serve fresh bread with olive oil + vinegar complimentary. For an appetizer, we ordered the cheese board which was great! My meal I ordered the Wild Mushroom Pasta and oh my wow, one of the best pastas I've had in the green valley area! For dessert, we ordered the strawberry panacata which was good!  Will be making my way back to this place. Very cute and bright!",

The tiramisu was moist & not too sweet! The colors accompanying it were a great addition! The (4) star is because of the service not the food. The service was less than satisfactory. We were left waiting & even when attempting to leave the waiter did not bring around the bill until probably a 10-15 minute wait after we were done & asked for the bill. If it was not for the restaurant itself & the food the stars would be less. However the food is great!",

I had my birthday dinner here back in November. My bf asked me where I wanted to eat (uhh loaded question, ladies you know what's up) I ended up choosing Bottiglia Enoteca located inside GVR. It was on my radar for quite some time. Plus I always seem to crave Italian food on my birthday. Age me and carb me up, per favore.  I have a thang for gnocchi and pesto, so I ordered that entree with chicken added. Honestly, it wasn't my favorite. Maybe it was the sauce, so I guess I don't like pistachio pesto. My bf's chicken parmigiana entree was leaps and bounds better. Our waitress prefaced that it doesn't come with pasta, but the chicken itself was sizable. So flavorful, I'd recommend that over my dish.  There was live music that night which added to the airy ambiance -- it was a solo act playing acoustic covers of popular songs. (Have you heard an Usher song with guitar?) We enjoyed it very much. To top off the night, our waitress surprised me with a birthday tiramisu. Decadent, loved it.",

The setting and outlay of the location was made beautifully, and really brings out a type of design that you rarely see in vegas, giving off a hamptons NY experience, especially with the music! I've had the eggs asparagus and some of the fruit plates. Both were well cooked. I highly recommend the penne pasta. Their alcohol drinks are also made quite well. The pricing is about average for the location and service you receive, and they do have bottomless mimosas. It seems to be a very Instagram-liked location especially with the elegant and clean outlay. You would never guess it's attached to a casino.",

I love everything about this restaurant- atmosphere, service, consistent and incredibly delicious dishes, and a unique cocktail program with something for everyone.  We love their happy hour, served in the bar and dining room. I could order all of their small bite offerings without hesitation, but the arancini and fried zucchini blossoms are the hot tickets for me! They're a smaller portion than a full appetizer and great way to keep the tab a bit more reasonable, especially for a twosome.   Although we had a small issue with one of our entrees, it was handled promptly and appropriately. Mistakes happen; it's all about the response and bounce back from it!",

On our latest trip in, I started with the mulo pazzo, their take on a Moscow mule, made with tequila instead of vodka and basil instead of mint. It was cool and refreshing.   For dinner, I decided to get an appetizer and a side of pasta as I'd been eyeballing the carbonara mac & cheese on the menu but never felt like I could finish an entree AND a side of pasta. The mac and cheese was wonderfully cheesy and was made complete with peas and guanciale (spiced, cured pork that tastes like really good ham). The appetizer I chose was the char grilled octopus which was perfectly cooked, tender and not rubbery. It was citrusy and the potatoes that the tentacles sat on were crispy and well seasoned.   Previously, I've also enjoyed their sangria rosso, chopped salad, meatballs, calamari, gnocchi, and spinach lasagna.   We really enjoy coming here when the weather is nice to sit outside on their lovely patio, and we've made reservations for 8 before and had great success having that many people together in the restaurant. I'd highly recommend giving this place a try because it is such a cute place and the food is really delicious.",

I gave it to them, and after two days I still hadn't received anything. I decided to reach out again, and finally got an email. I gave my phone number so we could discuss more in detail what I wanted, and we agreed to speak on Friday. Well, today is Friday and after waiting all day for a phone call, I still have not heard from them.

They weren't particularly busy for a Sunday at noon, which was nice.   I got to try a couple of items:  - COFFEE CARAMEL PECAN STICKY BUN: ($10) it'a basically a crunchy cinnamon roll with a layer of caramel pecan at the bottom and topped with a mascarpone icing. It was super sweet, but the crunchy aspect was a nice spin on a classic cinnamon roll. - 7/10 (a bit overly sweet. I could only do a bite or two).   - FRESH FRUIT WITH COCONUT CREME: ($7) ok this this is incredible SMALL. It should be on the menu as \"cantaloupe topped with berry compote and coconut creme\". It had a SLICE of cantaloupe (6 slices) as the base. Super overpriced for what I got. Tbh though the coconut creme was yummy. - 6/10 for the value of what it was.   - LOBSTER BENEDICT: ($32) for the price, this should have WOW'd us.... it did not. There was a good amount of lobster in it, but the eggs weren't cooked correctly for a Benedict (cooked medium vs a good runny poached egg you'd expect). The potatoes that came with it were waaaaay better than the actual Benedict. - 6/10 - I'd skip it for the price.   - ROSEMARY LEMONADE: ($6) just skip this. It tasted like carbonated lemonade that was way too sweet. There wasn't a taste of rosemary either. Whomp whomp. - 2/10  Our server also wasn't the most accommodating and every time I asked for something, it felt like I was annoying her.   This place has so much potentially, but I probably won't be back here.",

    "text": "Wow what an experience! I am so happy and love coming here!   Every time has been great but this time was over the top. We came here for brunch without a reservation and they were a bit busy. They told us they were able to seat us which I thought was very sweet since they were super busy.  Our waiter, Kelly, was the nicest waiter I have honestly ever had. He made amazing recommendations and helped us choose between a bottle of champagne and the bottomless mimosa. We ended up getting bottomless mimosas!  For brunch Kelly said the prosciutto eggs Benedict was his personal favorite so I ordered it and it was fabulous! He also recommended the pecan sticky bun with cream cheese icing and that was actual heaven on earth!  We also ordered the chicken panini and the burger with a side of truffle fries and those were so good!  I can't wait to come back again and always ask for Kelly now!!! He is the best!!!",

Friday nights they have live music. We were seated very close to the little stage they had. I was worried the music would be too loud. It wasn't at all. We had a great time as we always do.  We will be back  4/5/19. Crowded Friday night. That's ok because we wanted to sit at the bar. I love that they have Pinot Grigio on tap, and I'm digging the Perroni draft. We love the meat and cheese app and ordered the large, thinking that it would be a meal. We were wrong. We took so much home. But was it good. Our bartender, Tony, was awesome. We'll see you next time (and order the medium app)",

    "text": "I put in a reservation for 8 people here for my mom's 50th birthday. I called to see if they could take in a cake. They charge about $2 a slice but we didn't mind that so we went ahead and brought our own cake.   We got to the stand and the hostess took the cake immediately as it would be a surprise for my mom. We got seated right away. It was this cute little corner area that was blocked from the rest of the restaurant but you could still see the rest of the restaurant through book shelves. There were a small seating area as well around the table for photos and if you wanted to just hangout drink wine before the food arrives.   This restaurant is absolutely beautiful. It's clean and the decor is cute.   We ordered our food and came out perfectly. No complaints from our entire family. I got the linguini vongole which had garlic, white wine and clams. Sisters got their grilled salmon which had a quinoa salad, chick peas, and a lemon herb vinagraitte. Dad got the chicken marsala which had mushrooms, marsala wine and chicken jus. Mom had the wild mushroom tagliatelle with chicken which had black truffle cream, burrata and garlic crumbs. And brother in law had the wood grilled wagyu new york which had crispy artichokes and agrodolce steak sauce. I also got a side of the rosemary roasted potatoes.   Everything was delicious. The flavor of my entree was perfect. The linguini had the right amount of garlic that didnt over power the rest of the sauce. The clams were plentiful. The portions of these dishs were just right. It wasn't overwhelming. Everyone was pleased with their dishes.   At the end of dinner, they brough out my mom's cake with tons of candles on the cake. We sang happy birthday for my mom and bing bad a boom. DInner ended with perfection.   We enjoyed our experience here. Service was wonderful and the waiter did an incredible job at staying on top of everything. I wish I remembered his name because I'd definitely recommend being sat in his area!",

    "text": "Gorgeous decor. Warm, welcoming home-kitchen atmosphere but fell short of my expectations. Went in two days ago, almost two weeks after they opened, for a late dinner.  Stepped in from the south entrance not the casino entrance and loved the patio seating.  They were not busy but it took a while for someone to acknowledge our presence until we flagged someone and finally we were sat in their patio.    Bathroom:  Beautiful inside the restaurant but you do share hand wash sinks with men so that caught me off guard but didn't bother me.  They do need a full body mirror in there.   Food: I was not to hungry so ordered light.  We had to ask for bread.   Once we got it - it was pretty good and the honey butter is wonderful touch.   Roasted Tomato Soup:   SUPER SALTY! Now, I love seasoning and am no stranger to savory salty dishes but I couldn't really eat it.  I had to water it down with water to make it a bit edible until I finally gave up on it.  It comes with a Panini grilled cheese and although ok in taste it hardens after a while.  Fail here.    Spaghetti Squash: This was ok as well. I would have preferred it with no tomato sauce as this softens the squash and then it seems more like a mashed spaghetti squash.  Flavor was okay but nothing amazing.  Also thought that for $9 the portion would be bigger.  Perhaps a call to your cousin chef Salute at Red Rock might help in learning how to improve this squash to perfection.   I had also asked for red pepper flakes and it wasn't till I was finished with them that the young waiter came with them saying they couldn't find them yet they were sprinkled all over my boyfriend's clam linguini (which I tasted and also was too salty).    I love the decor, food has potential but for the price, it surely needs to improve.  As a new Henderson resident, I prefer driving to Salute at Red Rock or around the corner to Ventano's for an Italian meal.  Hoping you improve it!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I make it a point to try a new restaurant a couple of times a month. Bottiglia was an unfortunate disappointment and not a place I would return to or recommend.   After taking our drink order, the waiter brought out bread. We proceeded to wait for about 10 minutes before catching one of the bussers and asking for butter, which they had forgotten to bring.  We started out our meal with the beef carpaccio and a cheese & salami board.  Rather than asking, the waiter and brought us the happy hour versions of the dishes.  The appetizers were minuscule (even for a happy hour menu), and had different preparations than that which were listed on the dinner menu. They left a less than positive impression on our palates.  Next, we had the Halibut and Bucatini with King Crab, which came highly recommended by our waiter.  My halibut was bland and the farro was overcooked. The flavors in the Bucatini were well balanced, but I needed a magnifying glass to find the king crab. For 32$, I would expect more than 1 table spoon of mediocre shredded crab meat lost in a pile of pasta.  At this point, we weren't going to take chances on desert and asked for our check.   After experiencing it for myself, I can honestly say I am shocked by the good reviews I have read. The only good things about Bottiglia were the decor and cocktails. If you are looking for delicious food or a lovely dining experience, there are far better choices in the area.",

Arancini- my favorite. Deep fried risotto stuffed with cheese in a tomato sauce. We also dipped the bread into the sauce and cleaned the whole plate. Delicious  Caesar salad- nothing special. Chopped romaine tossed in Caesar dressing with shaved Parmesan and house made croutons   Squash blossoms- was not hot when we got it, and not as crispy as I would want. Filling was creamy and tasty  Cheese and salami plate-only came with two small pieces of cheese. Good quality salami and procuitto. Nobody came to explain what kind of jam or cheese we were having until we asked   Eggplant dip-a little too sweet for my taste and really creamy like a mousse.  Toast was perfectly crispy so we still ate it all  Meatballs- never made it to our table :(  They somehow misplaced our ticket halfway through our meal, so we sat through 2 hours of \"where's our food?\" and left without getting to try the meatballs that we ordered. We also had to ask for bread, which all the other tables had except us.  They were obviously down staffed that night and other customers around us were upset too. I hope the problems we ran into are just because the restaurant is new, so we'll revisit in a few weeks and try the dinner menu.",

We ordered 3 entrees to share: California eggs Benedict, Baked Gnocchi and Wood Roasted NY Sirloin.   I can't pick a favorite as they were all good. We also had their bread pudding...so tasty!   For sure, I will go back to try the other entrees!!",

Most memorable ones were the french toast, lemon pancake (yum!!) and the buratta and caprese salad. The vinegrette they used was out of this world!    Price: Reasonable. Around $15 per entree. The bill will probably run you about $25 to $40 per person if you get a drink with some appetizers  Overall: Highly Recommend!",

    "text": "If you like airy but florally white rustic aesthetic surroundings, clean-cut tall young lads for waiters, and just the right amount of Tuscan-style dishes, you'll take a fancy for Bottiglia Cucina & Enoteca.  Located within the walls of Green Valley Ranch resorts, its not so far from the entrance especially if you came from the movie theater front. Just hop on the escalators to the second floor casino and you'll see it on your left side past a few bustling restaurants and visual slot machines. Once you walk in, the hostess will happily greet you upon arrival. Don't hesitate to indulge or take a snap of the bright retro vespa near them though!   Service was as convivial as they are generous. Informative to the max, they left no hidden details of their happy hour of $1 oysters (we were just in time for it) and the fact that we came in for National Pasta Day was a definite plus (half off all the pasta selection of the menu)!  I ordered their veal marsala as my friend suggested I try something new for once instead of eyeballing a salmon at a fine dining restaurant all the time and not fear the idea that deer meat can be \"stereotypically gamey\" when in reality it can be quite delicious (oops). Our sides consisted of wood roasted cauliflower, brussel sprouts, carbonara mac and cheese and there were ample servings of it placed in cute sky blue Tuscan chinaware on top of thick wooden placemats. You are also given a complimentary bread appetizer in the beginning as a starter. As for cocktails, we asked for the most citrusy and fruity on the menu, and the waiter suggested the Endless Summer and Fresca Frizz. Needless to say I found them both satisfactory but leaned more towards Endless Summer since it tasted light on the alcohol and an easy drink to down rather than the Fresca Frizz (you can taste more of the vodka here).   My friends ordered the short rib and the halibut respectively. We all tried each others dishes and I was surprised on how juicy the veal was! I would definitely order this again whenever I have the chance to. Braised Short rib wasn't dry at all, but neither was it overpowering in seasoning so it was savory at best especially with the added spinach ricotta dumplings. The pan roasted halibut was buttery soft, and although the combination with the risotto was rather strange at first taste (perhaps it was the puree?) it worked out well in the end after a few more bites, even though my friend did not care for their peas, I didn't mind it.  We topped the best for last with desserts. The dessert sample was an assortment of the tiramisu, strawberry pannacotta, and lemon poppy seed donuts. Generously so, the waiter and chef was able to divide the desserts fit for three people! Neither of the sweets were high in the diabeetus level so that's always a plus. The sampler was surprisingly on the house thanks to their manager, since I mentioned prior to reservation that our dinner was a small birthday celebration for our friend. How nice of them to accommodate this confectionary for us! It definitely set the bar up for our birthday celebrant, candle lit desserts and all. I also ordered their pistachio cannoli but wished they had the cream inside of the cannoli as a pistachio ice cream instead of just powdered pistachio nuts on the side.  Would love to come back again for their daily happy hour menu!",

Waited 30 minutes of checks. Because of this a few meals were comped and everyone received a discount. And Because of their hospitality, I will be back.

I actually did not like this presentation very much and prefer the traditional version. Too much chocolate curls or something. kids grilled cheese and tomato soup - my kid liked this  We've also been here for brunch and their menu is tiny. Not really my favorite for brunch due to the limited menu.  Ambiance: Really pretty, bright, white and pastel colors. Lovely outdoor seating option with flatscreen tv's. This is a nice place to take people visiting from out of town, in fact that is exactly what we have done on several occasions. I do feel that the ambiance is greater than the food. They need more food items and to punch up the flavor on the existing menu.  Service: We've always had great waiters here, very attentive and friendly.  Location: inside GVR. You can access through the parking lot closest to the restaurant and avoid walking through the casino.",

I don't think there's a way or reason to complain about too much sauce, so I won't; just know that there is no shortage of short rib at Bottiglia, especially not in this pasta dish. Seems like the noodles were freshly made in-house as well, but if not, they surely had me fooled. 5/5  Sampled an edge of my neighbor's Butternut Squash Ravioli, and that was divine too. Just get all the pasta. lol  Dranks! I tried two and loved 'em both. The Apricot Sour and fall pear specialty cocktail were healthy on the alcohol pour and tasty x2. The servers are super knowledgeable about the extensive menu and offered some great suggestions and comparisons to make deciding easier.  Lastly, there's really no bad vantage point in this restaurant. Very open, pretty all over, and perfect for any occasion. A dose of the unexpected from Green Valley Ranch to be much applauded. Can't wait to go back for brunch!",

The bad: - The live music was too loud for a classy restaurant. I'm not saying he was a bad singer, in fact we enjoyed him, however, he should've been playing at a lower decibel. It should be background music, not foreground. We switched our seating to outside so we can have an audible conversation with our company. - no bread. they ran out of bread on a Saturday night. this was my biggest disappointment. I just don't get how you are an Italian restaurant and run out of bread. It's like having no rice in an Asian restaurant. bad bad bad. - our company ordered the octopus appetizer and it was hard and not prepared right. he had to return it.",

I decided to give this place a try and first impression the restaurant is really beautiful, the hostess and waiter was not very friendly, or welcoming. That's where I should of turned away. We got seated anyways and turns out the waiter who was in the front ended up waiting on us. She did change her attitude right away after she came back around to tell us she would be our waiter. I found that funny. Because she could have been nice and polite from the start. But like the rest of these reviews the place is ran by a bunch of younger ppl, & I feel that's a good reason of it. Lots to learn. Now to the food. I ordered the salmon and brussel sprouts, $45. The salmon was $36 and side $9. I don't mind the price but I do expect high standards when paying it. The salmon had no flavor at all. It was plated quiet nice but I'm all for the taste the looks is always a bonus. They definitely failed that, the portion of the plate is incredibly small. For $36 dollars you should at least get more food or good flavor. And to the brussel sprouts I feel that they could of been delicious but they were completely torched. All I could taste was the burnt flavor. I don't recommend this place. It may be fancy looking but I would much rather go somewhere that at least serves good food.",

    "text": "Fantastic!!! I got a casino comp and figured ok, some Italian would be nice. I wasn't expecting anything more than the Olive garden and would have dressed up with at least a polo. The ambience was wonderful. Room lit to a dim candle light setting with a musician playing and signing acoustic jams. Very nice. The waitress and staff were all super attentive. I didn't get a \"we'll get your waitress\" vibe. Everyone was super nice. The presentation of the food was amazing. You get to see the food being cooked if in the right area and they wipe ur plate to make sure when you get to your table it is nothing short of perfection.   A little pricey but you truly pay for the wonderful experience and OMG their asparagus was my favorite!!!  My least favorite item was the calamari. It was a bit oversalted IMO. Also my plate had a chip in it. For presentation purposes I would not serve on a chipped plate. But those are such small miniscule items. I would come back and bring family to experience this wonderful restaurant on Fridays in the future.   I do hope you give it a shot. There is truly a reason they are 4.5 stars.",

It turns out that 5:00 to 7:00 on a weekday is happy hour, cool!  We made a meal of a bunch of different happy hour small plates, which was really cool because we got to taste a wide variety of different things.  Arancini, lemon-ricotta stuffed Zucchini flowers, Caesar salad, Meatballs, and (from the full menu) the most lovely steamed Octopus. Several had cocktails from the happy hour menu and those did not disappoint either.   Dessert was a sampler of 5 different cannolli which were all great. We especially loved the bright orange notes in the cream filling... Orangecello perhaps? They were amazing.   Everything was fantastic, flavorful, and worth the money. Our server, Eric, was attentive--service was just great.  So far, this has easily been the best restaurant we've eaten at here in the complex.",

It appeared that the bar area was populated by young professionals. They were nicely dressed, but not over the top. I would say jeans and button down shirts were trending that night! lol! The band was excellent! 80s cover songs, but nicely done! Easy to listen to while dining.   Equally important; The food was excellent!!! We started with the calamari! Perfectly prepared. We moved on to a caesar salad! Excellent as well. We finished with a pasta dish, topped with crab! Wonderful!!! The sauce was a little buttery, but tasted amazing. I only noticed, because I try to stay away from the calories. If you're on the same track, make sure you eat healthy the entire week or do some intense cardio before and after! It appeared that the bartenders were struggling a to keep up with the crowd, but I assume that's good for them! They were all super cool, so no big deal!   Love the decor! White theme! Clean! Slightly modern! Comfortable! When you walk in, you'll see a vintage Vespa! Love it!!! Oh, a little pricey.   I was there with my beautiful girlfriend. We both said we'd go back. If you're a local or staying off the strip for some reason, check it out!",

My server was Jenna and she got my iced tea to start me out.  She also gave me a couple of suggestions including an entree special of scallops.  She sold me.  I started with some roasted tomato soup that was quite good.  During this time, a runner brought me some focaccia and a plate with olive oil and balsamic.  I used one of the pieces of bread to soak up the last bit of soup from the bowl.  The scallops were served on a bed of polenta with onions and spinach.  There was a very crispy piece of bacon between two of the scallops.  It was a great dish!  For dessert, I got the chocolate, coconut pudding.  Very good and a fine finish to the meal.  As always, service was great.  That and the food keep me coming back.",

I noticed a floral decor motif and it gives it a clean, fresh atmosphere! On Sundays they have bottomless Mimosas! Note the orange juice is served in a separate carafe for you to pour in your champagne glass, and then the waiter will bring out the champagne. So funny, I poured it in my glass, took a sip, and was like, \"there's no alcohol in here!\"   I ordered the spinach lasagna. I know that probably wasn't the best choice to pair with a mimosa, but I haven't had spinach lasagna in so long, I had to order that! I'm so glad I did! It is actually a pretty big slice, and as much as I wanted to, I just couldn't manage to eat the whole piece.   The only thing that disappointed us was that there wasn't any bread available. Kind of odd since they serve pasta here. We went at 1:00 p.m.",

THANK YOU Chelsea for inviting us to come in and celebrate my best friends 40 th birthday. It is hands down the best girl brunch in this town. From the delicate decor, to the femme DJ playing great music. Mackenzie was such a great server. It was like she invited us into her home and made our experience personal and fun! The food..... YESS!!! It was delicious and worth the value. Most brunches only offer bottomless mimosas. I went in early to talk to a server about that. Only because my mom loves a mimosa. However, after having cancer and going through treatment. She can not have too much citrus. After sitting and looking at the bottomless options. They had a \"rose all day\" For $15. It took away that awkward conversation of not having too much OJ in her glass. I do honestly feel like the staff here would have accommodated us in any way. Mackenzie went out of her way to make sure we had a great time, took as many pictures to capture our fun day. All I can say is THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS DAY BEYOND SPECIAL!!!",

We tried the Kumiai oysters, they were wonderful, fresh, and mignonette complimented them perfectly.    We also had the octopus, served with crispy potatoes, thinly sliced peppers and an amazing sauce.  The dish was well balanced and would recommend trying.    For main dishes bf had the Wagyu steak. The crispy artichokes served with the steak were a pleasant surprise and a nice change from a traditional potato. I had the vegetarian Mushroom Tagliatelle-- omg sinful. So delicious and the portion size wasn't too large. The creaminess of the sauce and the black truffle are a delightful match.    Compliments to the chef!  We were pleasantly surprised.  When we came here we were expecting a good dinner but we were swept off our feet by the service, the food, and ambiance.  Looking forward to trying more from his kitchen. Thank you Daniel for your friendly hospitality.    We will definitely be telling our friends of this place!!",

Came for a birthday brunch and ordered the Prosciutto Eggs Benedict.  The dish was at best, average. Quite honestly it was a little disappointing. A properly cooked egg benedict is supposed to be poached and composed of a runny yolk when cut into, which is the BEST PART! However, this egg yolk was anything but. My excitement was quickly overcome with sadness when I cut open my egg to find a very firm yolk. The prosciutto was also very tough to chew. It just reminded me of thinly sliced ham that was extremely over cooked. That said, the charm of this restaurant is what made up for the amount of stars I gave because it is just THAT cute! Definitely wouldn't order the eggs benedict so if I ever find myself here again, I will definitely try something else.",

There was little closed off separated area so it's a great place for private party. Lounge area is surprisingly large and nice! If you wanna good Italian food and good wine I recommend this place!",

    "text": "I've eaten here a few times when they just opened, even eating on their private room a couple times. I've enjoyed the food but, my last experience there was one for the books.  A friend wanted to celebrate her birthday here and low and behold, it was during happy hour and during a Vegas Knights hockey game so, it was packed. PACKED. Especially by the bar!  Mind you, I brought my son (in his stroller) to the restaurant as my son is a heavy 7 month old. I more than expected to leave my stroller in the front with the receptionist but, she lead me to my table. As I walked through the HH crowd by the bar, I overheard one of the patrons say \"babies don't belong in a restaurant.\" I let that comment slide cause maybe I was \"just hearing things.\" But throughout dinner, I just couldn't get that comment out of my mind. Like, WHAT ASSHOLE would say that. Meanwhile during my meal, I saw kids at other tables so, yes this is a kid friendly establishment. Heck my son was quiet the whole meal, ironically, hooked on the Golden Knights hockey game playing behind my shoulder.  Outside of that dumb remark, our meal was fantastic. Highly recommend the meatballs, wild mushroom tagiatelle, and you must get the mozzarella. MUST get the mozzarella -- that breading was super yummy...and it was so simple.  Service was impeccable.",

    "text": "Two good things: 1) service is very friendly and 2) restaurant is very pretty and cozy. Well, I came here to eat so that needs to be the star review of this show! We came for breakfast brunch. I ordered the avocado toast with poached egg. It comes with tomatoes as well as pesto and is on toasted bread. I make avocado toast at home that is fantastic and it's generally great where ever I go. It is really hard to mess up avocado toast. This place messed it up! To begin with, their avocado toast is way too complicated. The simpler, the better. The pesto was so heavy and literally soaking into the bread, while the bread itself was hard as stone. The worst part is that there was some kind of vinegar added to either the avocado or the pesto that just wasn't right with the whole combination. It overpowered everything and was seriously awful. I could not eat the bread because of how hard it was and simply took some of the poached egg and tomatoes off of there but left everything else. I also ordered a salmon/lox and bagel platter. It comes with an everything bagel and there are two things I did not like: the first is that I had to ask for more cream cheese as there was such a minute amount. The second is that the cream cheese was hard in consistency and bordered on tasting like goat cheese. I have had many bagel and lox plates and this is one of the weakest. The biggest problem was the meal that my friend ordered. This is the meal offered for breakfast in pretty much any restaurant offering breakfast and should be 100% full proof for success. She ordered the eggs any style breakfast. She wanted two eggs sunny side up and ordered hashbrowns with it. She also ordered a side of bacon. The bacon was OK and edible as were the eggs, only after she had to send back the first serving of eggs because there was a hair in the first serving! The hashbrowns were unbelievably bad.  Burnt and crusty and just didn't look good as well as glistening with oil. Unfortunately, it tasted just as awful as it looked. My friend made me take a picture because the chewed part of the hash brown looked just like the part that was served to begin with. It absolutely looked like someone cooked it and left it there for a week. How does a chef serve this??? My friend even tried to put a lot of Ketchup on it and that did not help. I actually took a picture because you literally cannot see the chewed side from the untouched side. Seriously disgusting and to think that they offered the hashbrowns as a separate order for eight dollars. The coffee was OK and served in small cups which they are good at refilling if needed The total for this awful breakfast brunch was $63.87, and this does not include alcohol but simply coffee! Exorbitantly expensive for terrible food. There is no way we would come here again. From hair in the food to over greasy and over fried food that looks burnt and disgusting... The restaurant may look pretty but everything else is complete and utter trash.",

Extremely loud , had to shove people out of the way to get to our table ... right next to the open kitchen... couldn't hear the person speaking next to me.. we had happy hour Arrancini... mediocre, bolognese, mediocre ... ordered chicken Marsala.. what came out was a joke... 1 pc of chicken beaten to death with a sauce that tasted scorched and maybe five pcs of shemiji mushrooms, no Marsala flavor, more of a watered down demi... extremely disappointed.. they also told my wife they were taking extra time to make sure her vegan gluten free food came out right and it came out covered in cheese... so I ordered a veal rage dish that came out like a salt lick, then my wife's pasta came out 10x worse so salty I spit it out ... obviously a kitchen that just doesn't care, what happened to tasting your food before it went out ?... best dish of the day was the bruschetta , but you have to try hard to screw that up... got my waste of a veal replaced by the saddest beet salad o have seen in my entire career.  Bland, 2 leave of arugula, and a flavorless yellow goop dotting the plate.. that was the breaking point for me. So far beyond extremely disappointed and will never come back... and thank you for ruining my mother in laws dinner and alll the dirty looks from your joke  of a chef.",

There was a slight wait due to the restaurant being crowded which is understandable for a Friday night in Vegas!  Once we were seated, the hostess presented us menus and within seconds our server Heidi came over.  She welcomed us and did the usual \"Is this your 1st time\"...& yes it is.....however her response was so warming when she responded \"Well what took you so long, we have been waiting for you!\"   She had recommended the nightly special which was a lamb pasta and bolognese & we decided to order that!  It was a fabulous warming meal as she suggested.  Very tasty!  After our meal ended, Heidi invited us back for brunch on Sunday!  Heidi was a great server and she really made us feel like she was a friend!!!  We will be back on Sunday for brunch!!!   BTW...the restaurant is beautiful!!!!",

She made us feel like royalty every single time we came in and we were so sad to find out she was no longer with you guys. I asked my husband if he still wanted to get dinner here and we were quickly cut off by a very rude woman ( looked like a manager but was seating guests at the hostess stand ) who informed us Christina was \" let go \" I asked Why?! She was our favorite and she said she had great servers who could help us.. Very uncomfortable and unprofessional. Owners/GM/regional's inform your staff it is not their place to air your restaurants dirty laundry. I hope this was a 1-off and your staff does not happily inform customers that staff was \" let go \". For example, if a customer asks For an employee who is no longer with your company and they ask \"why\" a great response is: He/She left to pursue other opportunities. It is as simple as that.",

The cavatelli was fresh which was nice, the food itself is decent. Im Italian my self and can make all this at home. They also have ridiculous charges, my father got a side of pasta and asked for linguine and was charged an extra $3. All in all the food was decent for the price ($125 for 4 people) our waitress was nice but I can get this type of food anywhere else and it wasn't anything special",

You can tell this is not a classic Italian joint for a few reasons (1) they have no fruit dessert (2) they will not provide oil and vinegar for the table (3) they will not provide a spoon for pasta. The bread they do serve is spectacular. The portions of meat are grand. However they offer no side salad option. As an Italian woman, I am not so impressed with this hipster Italian joint, despite its pottery barn flare. Feels like home without the home feel, if you get it.",

Our server Alyssa came by and was sure to pour our drinks from the carafe every time. I ordered the prosciutto eggs Benedict and wow that was to die for! Came with a large side of crispy potato wedges. Be sure to order the bread pudding that is a starter...comes with a side of caramel that you pour on. Such a delicious treat !",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying I'm giving this restaurant 3 stars solely for the aesthetics and two of the three plates we got.   The decor is pleasing to the eye and definitely makes you feel at home. I was with a larger group so they sat us in a private area and drew a curtain for privacy. The waiter knew we had a movie to catch and he was very prompt about getting drinks ordered.   A bread platter arrived shortly after we ordered appetizers. The butter is to die for! Sweet, creamy, and a slight lemon undertone, absolutely perfect.   Slowly appetizers started to arrive but not all at once. Some got theirs and about ten minutes later another... Odd but okay, about 30 minutes later the waiters began clearing appetizer and bread plates to prepare for the main course. Unfortunately, I had not gotten my beet salad yet. I mentioned it to the waiter and a few minutes later, it arrived. This was worth the wait. The beets were sweet and tender, the goat cheese added a nice sharp contrast, and the sauce was creamy and wrapped the whole dish together beautifully.   That was the last good thing that happened... The main course took an additional 40 minutes, and only one person's dish came out. Over the next 10 minutes, more dishes began flying out. I ordered the seared pork, which I am sad to say was not worth the wait. The flavors were mediocre at best but it was a large portion. I shared with my date so it filled us both pretty well.   The movie was at 8:45, dinner was fully served by 7:40. Empty water cups by 8:00 and our waiter flitters in and tells us he's getting our checks ready, 8:20 and some of our cards were charged incorrectly. My date and I left a little early for another event around 8:40...  Granted, maybe our large group of 15 played a role in the less than superb service but I've never had such horrible service or only had one waiter. Perhaps he should've asked for help or had manager help delegate tasks. I won't be back. My friends and I can get better food with better service elsewhere.",

Usually, I'm just disappointed due to a total lack of potential.  I was also conflicted with how to rate this restaurant.   If I were to rate the manager, or lack thereof, this restaurant would receive 1 star.  Thankfully the upbeat staff, sans direction from their leader have changed my mind to increase to 3 star.  I feel obligated to mention how disgusted I am of the manager.  A gentleman, let me correct, a man that focuses all of his attention, and feels that it is a priority to text in the middle of the dining room, chat and make out with who I assume is his girlfriend at the end of the bar.  More importantly he does this in the middle of service on a Friday night. Of the several times I have dined at this restaurant, I have witnessed at least one, if not all of these behaviors all three times. How does that beard even pass health code inspection? In such a beautiful restaurant, with such a welcoming atmosphere, why do we have bum wandering around pouring bottles of Krug (check your pour cost there boys!!) for a couple of 20-somethings that wouldn't know Krug from Cook's.",

GREAT food service drinks!! .....THEN here comes the same manager (I guess these are owned by same people) he pointed at us and started talking to the manager of the place we were now happily eating at.

    "text": "Only thing wrong with this restaurant is the name. Botig...botlag...botalia? Whatever.   Food: excellent. Every dish was perfectly seasoned, well thought out and creative...but not too creative (in the best possible way).   Service: attentive, personable, but unobtrusive. I'd also like to point out the patience our server had with a nearby table who was being terribly rude to him. He also dealt with my obnoxious 11 month old daughter in stride.   Atmosphere: this is where botigglia (sp?) really shines. I felt comfortable, but there was an air of distinguishability...hautiness. But not in an annoying way. I felt like I could be dining at a restaurant on the coast of the Mediterranean.   Wonderful addition to the growing number of great restaurants in the area.",

    "text": "One word to describe Bottiliglia, disaster.  To start off the disastrous experience, we called and made a reservation. When we arrived, the three hostesses could not find our reservation. However, they were still able to seat us. After we were seated it took a while for our waitress to bring our menus, it took longer for our waters to be delivered, it took even longer for our orders to be taken, and it took an eternity for our food to be delivered. Also, I tried to use the Yelp check in offer for a free glass of wine but my waitress did not honor it. Conveniently some tables that were seated after us received their food before us. One table also finished their meal before we received our food. After our food was delivered, precisely 65 minutes after first sitting down, we asked for our check. Of course to cap off a bad experience we are brought another table's check. After we got the right check, it was the check used to charge hotel guests who charge to their rooms so again we had to request another check. Horrible multi flawed dinner.  My party had the spinach lasagna, the pappardelle bolognese, and the clam linguini. The food itself is decent. Nothing special nor worth writing home about.   I will not be returning and cannot recommend dining here. If you do dine I suggest giving them several weeks to try working some of the many kinks out.   The restaurant itself is nicely renovated. The service is very flawed and needs major overhaul. We did dine on Friday the 13 so that may have been our downfall.",

    "text": "After reading my previous review I was contacted by the manager. She was able to locate my check, confirm the discrepancies and correct them without me having to pack up my children and leave my home. She was exceptionally kind and understanding. Honestly, the best part is that after talking with me last night she even remembered who I was after a very brief encounter with me during brunch. She remembered me standing next to her secretly peeking through the window watching my son do his flower pot activity and she remembered that, that was a huge step for my family as my son has special needs and that was the first time he went off on his own to participate in an activity. It really touched my heart that in a restaurant full of patrons and after an entire shift and interactions with dozens if not hundreds of people after me, she remember little o'l us & she remembered how significant the experience was for our family. I think it takes someone really special to pay that kind of attention to customers & remember individuals and their stories in a professional environment with so many other responsibilities and so much on their plate. I felt very nervous and really embarrassed about my check that day & after talking with her I wish I hadn't been too insecure to talk to her while I was there in the restaurant. Diane, I'm not sure if you will see this one, but from the bottom of my heart, Thank You for everything. You were so kind to me and I was so nervous and so embarrassed about the entire situation. You made me feel comfortable and that means the world to me. You are appreciated.",

Entrees run 20.00 to 47.00 to stay informational and evenhanded.  The last time, though, we went, was a 1/2 price entrees (go to green valley ranch site 4 more info). They fixed my pappardelle Bolognese,  subbing spaghetti as pasta.  My wife had the wild mushroom tagliatelle. She was VERY please by this rich tasty dish. Even has a kids menu. Something for the red meat'ers. and the vegan palate. Nothing I've had there was \"ordinary \". All, so far, has been good to excellent. All the usual Italian suspects such as marsala, picatta , lasagna etc.  and generous portions.",

He was also with another huge party but still let us know he was paying attention to us keeping up on drinks and making sure we were ok. Made a reservation and waited maybe 5 minutes past it but we're all offered a free desert each (of our choice) to make up for it. Everyone was smiling and very friendly and open.   Only down side is you have to pay extra for sides and food took a little long, but it was a busy night so still wasn't too bad.   The Tiramisu desert! It is TO DIE FOR.   I'd go back again and definitely ask for ZACH",

    "text": "Wait... This is INSIDE the casino? Bottiglia is BEAUTIFUL. I've never seen a restaurant fit so awkwardly into its surroundings. Walk through the zombies of Hendersonians playing slots in the dark, dreary casino and make your way to the brightly lit, Pinterest perfect Italian restaurant. There are comfy couches to sit with in-laws, a classy bar to sit with your hot date, cozy circular tables to snuggle up or a fun patio to sit with your coworkers. Bottiglia is perfect for everyone.  We started the night with the charcuterie board- 3 for $12 was almost too much for the two of us to split. The teahive from Utah had a sweet honey taste and I loved it. Meat, cheese, apricots, honey, chocolate bread on an adorable pig board. Yes, yes, YES. I can't wait to come back for happy hour ($6 wine?!?!?!) and order this again!  Linguini Vongole: SO MANY CLAMS. They brought out the bowl for our shells before they brought the meal and I was confused as to why the bowl was so big..... And then I saw why. The portions at Bottiglia are great. The pasta was perfect.  Veal Marsala: The meat was so tender and again, the portion was huge. Simple, but good. I have no objections on ordering it again, but I think I would try a different meat next time.  Yelp check in for a free glass of house wine! Bottiglia brought us out a beautiful  slice of chocolate cake with chocolate mousse and a candle when they heard it was my partner's birthday. THANK YOU GUYS- You made the night perfect!  Don't let the location (inside the GVR Casino?!) scare you away. Bottiglia could easily be a restaurant on the strip. This has to be the only restaurant in Henderson I've seen people dress nice in, haha. I can't wait to visit again when the weathers a little cooler and sit on your patio!",

We also had a few other people clear our plates from our table and they were very sweet. The service team made us laugh and feel very welcome. I would recommend the chicken parm, the meatballs, oysters, and the chicken piccata. Also the AGM, Mary, stopped by our table and asked how everything was... Absolutely love her.

We decide to check it out for brunch with party of 6.  We came few minutes late behind the original reservation, but surprisingly the place was almost empty at 12:30 on Sunday with great outdoor temp and few games going on on the tvs.  We asked for a table outside, after 10 mins the hostess had the table ready. The venue has nice patio amenities ( shades, mists etc) but the hostess decided to seat us on a table where mostly wasn't under the sun. We had to move to the other side of the restaurant where we found ourself perfect solid shaded patio.  Interior it's pretty impressive. Open concept, rustic design and very pretty pastel colors all over the venue ( my wife flower shoes were matching, she was excited)  Getting on the menu!  I didn't want to dig the menu before I get there I wanted to be surprised and wowed. Well I end up wowed with 6 brunch items. Noting impressive or mouth watering. Lox bagels, one Benedict option classic bacon with toast, yogurt and a cup of fruit! Yea cup of fruit as a main item on a brunch menu! Sad! Rest of the items were some pastas and dinner entrees. I saw end up getting carpaccio. It was ok, served with poached egg.  We tried most of the drinks. Blood orange mimosa and both sangrias. I think I got diabetes afterwards. Soo sweet and plain. No twist at all.   Our sever was slow in general. I don't know what was the reason for it, but we were waiting for drinks for a while, water glasses were empty most of the time.   After all I love the ambience, the location and the vibe at this place. Service and food quality need to be improved.",

Located inside the Green Valley Ranch Casino, this place is nicely decorated, with wide spaces for each room and some wide openings on the outside, which is appreciated. He host was very nice and made us wait for a couple of minutes in the lounge area while they were prepping our table. We got some nice bread and butter as soon as we sat down. Then it started to become a bit more complicated... we were there at 8 pm, since they warned us they were closing at 10 pm. It literally took our server over 30 minutes to take our orders... The first appetizers came out at 9 pm. Food is nice. Not amazing, and pretty small portions for the price. I had the zucchini flowers as an appetizer, which were good but only had 3 mini-flowers for $13... and then the baked gnocchi arrabiata for $22. Slightly over cooked and not spicy at all, despite the server's warnings. We had to wait for another 30 minutes to order some desserts, since our server completely disappeared then. The thing is, for a restaurant with this kind of pricing, I am expecting a higher level of service and quality. Otherwise I'd rather cook and eat at home.",

    "text": "Well, I spoke too soon. Went for a return visit and it was about as lackluster as it gets. The meatballs had changed and weren't nearly as moist and flavorful. The salad tasted oddly dusty and when returned we witnessed the chefs taste it and offer up no explanation or apology for the poor product. Just strange expressions and a disposal of ingredients.  The service was off putting and a bit rushed.   Yes Bottiglia, yes.  I finally went with one of my girlfriends for dinner last Saturday evening after eyeing their photos numerous times. We were planning a night out and wanted to have a relaxed and comfortable environment to catch up in before we lost the ability to hear ourselves think. The interior of this place is stunning, it almost makes you rethink that you are in good ol' Las Vegas. Any restaurant that has comfortable seating at every table like Bottiglia's cushy floral patterned chairs gets a gold star of approval from me, take your all metal bar stools and hipster chic wooden benches elsewhere please.   The food was good, not great (this time), but very good.   The complimentary olive bread and honey butter were nice but the standard baguette was a bit on the dry side. We ordered the meatballs with burrata, the fried zucchini flowers and the carbonara mac and cheese to share.  Meatballs $12- Fantastic, great flavor, tender and juicy but I found it odd to serve 3 small meatballs in a dish that isn't sized appropriately. It made it seem like someone snatched one from the dish and started snacking, I wouldn't blame them if they did.  Zucchini Flowers $13- I loved the ricotta filling, the plating was simple but complimented the dish, my friend did mention and I have to agree.. there was an overwhelmingly strong lemon flavor. I love lemon and would order this again but for the non lemon enthusiast you might want to skip it.  Carbonara Mac and Cheese $9- I wanted to love you. I really did. The guanciale in this ruined it for me, whoever prepped that component for the dish took it past crispy and into the not black but definitely charred bacon zone. When it no longer crumbles, instead it turns into a dark dust of bitter pork powder. We ended up picking all of the pieces out and ate the majority of it because why waste pasta?     We also had the Dessert Sampler $15?-  Strawberry Pannacotta:, it was okay, the thyme was a tad overpowering. Tiramisu: usually not my favorite but one of the better ones that I have tried. Lemon Poppy Seed Donuts: best of the bunch and a nice way to finish a meal.  Cookie: went straight into a bath of cappuccino, soak it up little buddy.   All of the critiques aside, I have already told 15 people they have to try them out. Nothing felt rushed, everyone was attentive, not a single dish was bad and it was a beautiful environment to be in. I plan on being back to explore the menu very soon, I'm looking at you pan roasted halibut ;)",

Must try items:  Red sangria Short rib cavatelli (dinner menu) Meatballs (HH) Calamari (huge portion) Arancini (HH)  I loooooved the red sauce. I could literally eat it like soup.

First off, Bottiglia is beautifully designed, with a relaxing  decor yet as this fresh, hip vine. The staff is all gorgeous. The men and women.    We were lucky enough to be seated in the bar area, and had the most genuine & knowledge server named Kobee.  Kobee was not only completely knowable of the menu, but confident in giving his favorite recommendations which we ordered. And  very happy that we did. Thank you Kobee for being one of the highlights of this dining experience. You are a True asset.     Definitely order the tuna tartare, octopus, mushroom risotto, and the Mac-n-cheese! They're all delicious, flavors on point and worth the recognition. Hats of to Chef Brian Massie, who even took the time to come by the table, and chat.  (Love the artwork on the arms Chef)     So if you like looking at beautiful people, in a chic setting, while enjoying delicious culinary art, Go try BOTTIGLIA. Make a reservation first.   Cheers!

Our server Heidi was very polite and helpful in picking out a few things. The food came out quickly as they had just opened for the evening. We started with the meat and cheese board and split a phenomenal tomato soup! She went out of her way to make sure it was spilt in separate bowls. After this, we were so full, we took we our pasta and dessert to go. I would recommend asking for Heidi as she was splendid and very attentive! We will definitely go back next time we are In Vegas! Heidi is top notch, professional, and very attentive.",

Our party was greeted when we walked in with friendly conversation and big smiles. We arrived early so we could have a drink at the bar, the sangria is my favorite (in Vegas). Bartender was very attentive and friendly. Once seated, our waiter Zack was awesome, he was very knowledgeable of all the items, specials and everything else about any dish we inquired about (which was many). I chose the chicken parm which was amazing and a huge portion. We had some appetizers prior which also were equally amazing, hard to pick a favorite! We all had a wonderful time and enjoyed talking with Zack and the other staff we encountered. I will definitely be coming back again soon and also recommending to my friends. Keep up the great service and wonderful food!",

We started with a Caprese, and followed that with the calamari and tuna tartare. All three were super good, but the tuna stole the show for sure. For the entrees, I got the Short Rib Cavatelli and my girlfriend got the Rigatoni and Cherry Tomato. We also got the brussel sprouts and spaghetti squash to share. Everything was delicious, well coursed, and plentiful. Nick and the staff were amazing and I would highly recommend Bottiglia  if you're looking for a good date spot in a beautiful venue.",

    "text": "I went to Bottiglia for bunch. The aesthetics were great and they had a very presentable staff. BUT, service was just bad. My food came before my drink. Our server was confused half the time. It took our server forever to get our check, and another eternity to run the transaction. Mind you, we didn't even have separate checks and there were two tables tops in his section. The food was just not good at all. I had the chicken parm-- bland, pretentious and over priced. We also ordered gnocchi-- mush, mush and more mush in canned tomato sauce.  If that sauce is house made, please reevaluate that recipe because that was not good. It was probably the same bland sauce they used in the chicken parm just with a touch on cayenne pepper. It was just bad. The gnocchi wasn't even sauteed the way a proper gnocchi should be, it was probably ripped open from a package of pre-made gnocchi from Target, boiled and thrown in thinned out Hunt's tomato sauce. And what happens when you bake mush in a pool of sauce? You get the picture. We paid almost $200, and normally it that would be a fair check for four for brunch, but it really was not worth it. I later found out that they were actually managed by Clique Hospitality and I've learned from past experiences that they're restaurants are nothing short of disappointing. Great drinks, but the food and service was very pretentious and just overall bad. It's a shame because the restaurant is designed beautifully. They're food and FOH operations need a lot of work. A LOT!!!",

    "text": "Bottiglia Cucina & Enoteca is an Italian cuisine restaurant located in the green valley ranch casino and hotel. The restaurant provides rustic Italian food, fancy cocktail and wine as well.    I love the decor very much in here. The restaurant has low table, high table, bar sitting as well as a private dining area. I had seen someone hold a private party at the dining room, so fascinating. On the outside, they also have a Italian countryside style bicycle, which is perfect for photoshoot.   Wine and cocktail are so great at here. I ordered white sangria and endless summer.  The ice on the wine has flower in it, the server told me that the ice are not made from pure water, after the ice melted into the wine, the wine will have another flavor. As for the endless summer, it has a very fresh taste, great drink on the hot summer time. The coconut and pineapple fresh your mouth; the citrus gives the drink a little sour and bit taste. A great cocktail to start the meal. Food is amazing. I would say it is the best Italian food in town, for me at least. Wood roasted tomato soup has the sour and salty flavor. The flavor is really impressive to me. Some people may think that it is a special, even wield taste, but I really like it. The bread serving before the meal is amazing. The bread includes parmesan crispy flake, French baguette, cheese bar and cranberry walnut bread. The flake is extra crispy and tastes fantastic with the butter. Butter is honey-lemon infused. The taste is fresh and great. The cranberry walnut one is my favorite. It is just fairly sweet. The main entree I chose is the braised short rib. I chose medium for my rib. The meat tastes fresh and oily. It smells fragrant. The shape and decoration of my dish is attractive. I really enjoyed my entree. The portion for the short rib is really big. Even if the rib tastes really good, I cannot finish it by myself as a girl.",

This spot was by far my most enjoyable and memorable dining experience of the trip with my two best gal friends.  To start, the restaurant is  BEAUTIFUL and aesthetically appealing in every sense of the word. We showed up an hour before close (so sorry we were running late), like many restaurants do I was fearful we would be rushed out the door and a turn and burn table. Instead, we had top knotch service. We were greeted by the friendly Manager Javier & our server Kobee. They were kind and informative and it was obvious that they were going to make sure it was a memorable experience for us.  We ordered many appetizers (do yourself a favor and get the zucchini flowers), a bottle of wine (Kobee recommended the lovely and tasty antinori peppoli), full entrees and everything from presentation to the obvious team work culture, to the TASTE of everything we had we were blown away and it was so lovely.  On top of all of that, they sent out a sample of a dessert liquor and dessert, a sample appetizer, and some champagne on the house. I kid you not- we asked for an experience and they gave us one. I was so thankful and it made the evening with two long distance friends catching up, the most pleasurable time imaginable and we thank Javier & Kobee for this!! What a beautiful establishment that I wish would come to washington DC! Thank you!!",

This time everything was diced up smaller than the size of a pea, very \"loose\" and bland. Almost like pre prepared kind from a can  The older way, big pieces of potatoes and corned beef was superb. And then blood orange juice tasted very very watered down...Won't order this again....",

    "text": "Super chic and clean Italian restaurant. Located in Green Valley Ranch Resort and Casino, it is not too hard to find. From the moment you walk in, you are greeted right away and will notice the cool Vespa off to the side. The place is usually bustling with diners enjoying themselves with a glass of wine or cocktail with their meal.   The space is very open and extremely well decorated. Think of modern country with a hint of Victorian elegance. This would be a great place for brunching or dates. Now, without knowing, I happen to go when certain pasta dishes are half off for that month. That being said, I ordered the King Crab bucatini and a slightly spicy tomato pasta dish I don't recall the name of, but both were the really good. The portion sizes are not giant and not tiny either. I think they are the correct serving size recommended by nutritionists. I ended up ordering a glass of their house wine and it was good too. The service was very professional and consistent. Although a little pricey if it weren't for the special they were  running, I would still come  back for the ambiance and food. Highly recommend.",

(Shout out to Kelly for tolerating our shenanigans!)  The house wine (complimentary with a Yelp check-in) was pretty pleasant. I tried two of their cocktails, the La Bella Vita and the Sgroppino, and both were excellent. As for their happy hour appetizers, I had the arancini, which was very delicious, and shared a dessert sampler with some friends. (The lemon poppy seed doughnuts were the best part, the tiramisu was unfortunately pretty mediocre.)  I don't know that I'd make this a regular happy hour spot as I tend to prefer more food and beer options over wine and cocktails, but I'd definitely like to try dinner here sometime.",

    "text": "Bottiglia is a solid spot for brunch in Henderson. As for dinner, I don't remember it being as memorable. The food is done well, but what makes Bottiglia a place where I'd return again lies in the sauces/syrups. Where the food lacks in creating a truly novel experience, Bottiglia makes up in service and ambiance/atmosphere. The restaurant is generally good for both brunch and dinner, but it lacks something that would truly make it stand out and shine. So far, all I've come up with is that it's aesthetically pleasing and the sauces/syrup are great.  I've come here twice for brunch and the last/most recent time, we got the cinnamon bread pudding starter, pancakes with cinnamon butter and bourbon maple syrup, two eggs any style, and an everything bagel.   The cinnamon bread pudding was pretty good. It's your run of the mill bread pudding with some decorative edible flowers on top. What makes it a thousand times better is the sauce. I honestly think the sauce really ties it all together and makes the bread pudding something I'd want to order again and again. For the price, it's okay. It's definitely something extra I'd order if I'm feeling particularly zesty that weekend. You know, channeling my inner 'treat yo self' a la Parks and Rec.  The pancakes were fluffy and done well. Again, what made it that much better was the bourbon maple syrup. It was so flavorful and rich, and it lent a nice helping hand in making the pancakes go from average to slightly above average.  Overall, I feel like Bottiglia knows how to cook/bake things well, but the True star of the food lies in the sauces. The sauces are were the small bit of creativity lives.",

I could see that it had some shops and restaurants and might be interesting.  That evening, as I was figuring out what to eat for dinner, I searched for a restaurant in this general area, and Bottiglia came up as a highly rated option.  After looking at the photos, I was sold!  The decor and interior was so unique and inviting in the pictures, I had to try it.  Upon arriving, I was surprised to find the restaurant was attached to a casino.  But, I was committed, so I proceeded.  I am so glad I didn't get put off by the location.  The interior was fantastic.  The service was outstanding, and the food was delicious.  I had the pasta with lobster, and it was outstanding.  Happy hour wine for a small price as well.   The bar was a great place to dine alone, and there were several business people dining alone there.  Definitely will return on my next trip for work!",

Every drink is loaded with ice whether you want it or specifically ask for neat or straight up and there is a $3 charge for that magic ice. Yikes. A double Jack D that is a shot and a half short in an unwanted glass of ice equals $17 for crap. How about switching out one veggie for another on your entree. Look at your check closely. Our party got charged $5 a pop for each incursion. I hate doing this because it usually isn't the servers fault (unless she was trying to jack up the bill) but since the manager wouldn't budge on any of this, the money had to come from somewhere. She wound up with a tip of around $12 on a $230 bill. My family and I are not going to get ripped off.",

The decor and ambiance is a 5 star and the food is good (not great) but the service was really subpar. I had to ask for refill of iced tea, our bread plate was never brought out (finally asked for it) and no refill on coffee and at $4 a cup that was a real waste for the size of the cups. We noticed several tables that got more attention than we had so maybe since we are not locals or regulars we just didn't fit in? Even the hostess was a bit stand offish, not rude just not a warm greeting. Too bad as the place is really so pleasant to be in. If only the service was spot on it would have made the $150 bill more tolerable. Tonight was definitely not worth the money we paid.",

The food, what we were able to order, was delicious, but our service was extremely subpar. Our server, Audree, took our drink order and delivered our drinks. After she brought us our drinks, she took our food orders and then WE NEVER SAW HER AT OUR TABLE AGAIN. Runners delivered our meals and refilled our waters. I sat with an empty wine glass and we all sat for at least a half hour after we were done eating our meals before we gave up on her coming back to our table to ask if everything was OK and flagged down a runner to get our check and have our leftovers boxed up. We would have loved to order more cocktails and desserts, but we were tired of waiting for her, so we paid our bill and left. I was so embarrassed to bring my family here.",

I came with family, telling them that there was a new Italian spot at GVR and that we should check it out. The decor of the space looked nice and thought out. The service staff was ok, and they seemed relatively on their game. But the food here was lacking in every way possible. I ordered a carbonara which may not have been on the menu but was said the be prepared by the chef. If your an Italian trained chef a carbonara should be relatively easy. It came out just ok, a bit too thick but it was edible. My grandmother had the short rib that everyone seems to rave about, and it was certainly not edible. VERY dry, and the worst part is my grandmother tried to power through it because she didn't want to complain. I tried it, and asked hows shes eating it and her reply was that shes hungry but couldn't do it any more. I was embarrassed to have taken them to a new place and it failed me to the point where i had people at my table forcing themselves through their meal.

So when my friend sent me a picture of the menu and said we were going here for her birthday, I started to panic when I needed her to translate and already started planning places I could stop by afterwards to eat.  With all that being said, they had hands down the best chicken parmesan I've ever tasted! The portions were generous too.

I recently came to Bottiglia for a friend's birthday engagement. I was extremely impressed with the beer menu, fully understanding that most Italian restaurants throw an emphasis on their wine list. I was incredibly intrigued by the mythically named Dragon's Milk beer on their list (an American import), and promptly ordered it. This beer floored me. Not in the \"carry me out of GVR\" way, but in the \"wow! This is mighty tasty for 11% ABV!\". After sharing with the mostly non-beer drinking table, they agreed. This beverage was a True winner right from the start.  My girlfriend and I ordered the braised veal ravioli with sauce and peas, and as expected in a fine restaurant as such we were delivered a total of four medium sized raviolis. Keep in mind, this is a fine restaurant and you are paying for delicacies here, not for portion size. The ravioli themselves were tremendous and I highly recommend them. In keeping with posterity, we also ordered the side order of macaroni and cheese, which was thoroughly tasty and more filling than the ravioli (for those of you who are on a budget, as I always am).  All in all, with this Italian restaurant you pay for exactly what you receive. For myself personally, that's all that you could ask of a restaurant. So try out Bottiglia, eat, drink, and be merry.",

It was Bottiglia saying we noticed you haven't been in a while would you like to come in and receive a 50% discount off your bill.  So I said sure we will come in.  We arrive at opening and upon seating are offered a regular menu and happy hour menu.   We ordered the baked mozzarella, the baked rigatoni, the lobster diablo, and the anti pasta misti plate.  Most of the items we didn't finish.  In general the food is missing something. The lobster diablo is good however the price point may be a little high. I feel they have made many food changes but the changes aren't improving the menu, taste or quality.  Unfortunately we left unsatisfied with the meal.",

The oysters especially stood out. Overall, our experience was nothing less than outstanding.",

We had the formaggi + salumi platter to start and that (along with the bread), was delicious! Our entrees were all excellent. My companions had the Braised Short Ribs (nice!) and the Chicken Piccata (quite good even if the sauce was a touch too salty). I had the Pappardelle Bolognese and it was the best pasta with bolognese sauce that I've had in decades! We were expecting good but not expecting to be as blown away as we were. Good job, Bottiglia! We'll be back!",

We did the family portion which feeds 4 people. I had the chicken piccata which I loved! I'm really picky about my chicken piccatas. I prefer the chicken breast thinner ( i don't care for a fat chicken breast... You can't taste the wine butter seasoning). I usually ask restaurants to butterfly the breast for me. I didn't have to do that here that's the way they do it...Thank you :). My mom had the eggplant parmesan which was excellent....i might have to get that next time. My sister had the spinach lasagna which i didn't get to try because she ate it all but it looked amazing!!! We also ordered a side of Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. Both were delicious and a must have when dining here. For dessert we had the lemon poppy seed donuts.  I wasn't sure if i was going to like it but the server recommended it. I'm glad he did....it was so good i couldn't stop eating it. I really love this restaurant they know Italian!!!",

We approached the hostesses and were informed since we didn't have a reservation that it would be an hour wait. We asked if we could eat at the bar and they said yes. While at the bar we noticed the restaurant had plenty of high tops and empty tables the whole time we were there. I asked the hostesses when we left why they would tell us that we had to wait an hour to wait when the restaurant was barely half full. She said they do what the chef tells them to do. Well what is the difference from ordering dinner at the bar or a high top? You can chase away customers by telling them an hour wait. Some people don't want to eat dinner at the bar. If it was a server issue she should have said that instead of blaming it on the chef who has to cook the food anyway.",

I had the chicken parm and it was good but $24 for just chicken and no side dish just didn't please me. My nephew had the pancakes with cinnamon butter and they were delicious!! My parents both had the build your own omelet and it came with potatoes that were amazing and also the toast came with this strawberry jam that was to die for. I feel that some of their entrees were great while others were just okay. Our service was bad and that's why I gave only 2 stars. Our waitress just kept making excuses instead of owning the situations and taking care of them. She was not very attentive and had an attitude. A lot of the staff was young and sometimes you need better trained, more experienced servers to be able to make a restaurant like this thrive. Due to the lack in service, I will not be returning but it was a good place to try.",

We waited almost 5 minutes to be greeted by the hostess. We were sat at a lovely table outside, so that made up for the wait...well, not really. We waited another 10 minutes for a server to come and take our drink order. We placed our entire order at once because the poor server was the only person servicing the entire patio - which is a lot for one person on a Saturday night. Appetizer came before our drink order, which is always suspect, meaning it was all prepped and simply microwaved once the order hit the kitchen. Nuked mealballs never works, period. The bread served was quite dry and stale. I had the wild mushroom risotto, which was more like cafeteria food, not a dining experience.  My husband ordered braised beef, it was ok but again, had a cafeteria \"buffet style\" to it. Tasted like it rolled off the Sysco truck into the microwave, plopped onto a plate and served with a hefty price tag. The wine was good, the wine got me through. It's a shame because the space is beautifully appointed but unfortunately the kitchen doesn't execute and the staff appear over worked and just try to keep up. I won't return.",

It was y=--underseasoned and could have used some salt or pepper. (not on table). One Caesar salad, one pasta dish, and one short rib platter - $65.00.

Had to ask waitress for everything from bread to Parmesan cheese to drink refills.  Lengthy time for meals to arrive and no explanation for the delay or offering more bread to fill the void.  One meal arrived 20 minutes after the other 5 meals with no explanation provided for the delay until we had to find the waitress to determine the reason for the delay.  Both my meal (Chicken Picatta) and my host who ordered Veal Marsala arrived barely lukewarm and knowing the 6th meal had still not been delivered; returning our meals for reheating was not going to happen .  The Chicken Picatta was overly peppered so you couldn't taste the wine/lemon/capers and the chicken was rubbery which was strange considering the thinness of the chicken cutlet.    No one in the party felt their meal was flavorful or plentiful to warrant the high cost, long delay (I mean it wasn't even 6 PM yet), and lack of service.  The manager had to get involved for the seriously delayed meal and lukewarm veal and chicken.  Though the manager discounted the meals there is no one in the party who felt they would ever return to Bottiglia (and we visit GVR several times a week).  Again, very disappointed.",

    "text": "Still questioning how I exactly felt about this place. Ate there last night w my boyfriend w high hopes! Made a reservation @ 7 PM. We got there at 6:50 and they said we couldn't get seated till 7. You'd think by making a reservation, that your table would be ready. We were waiting for awhile then more people began to wait after us. We were the last to be seated. That was the first flaw. We sat down and I had asked for a booth when making the reservation but got a normal table, that was still wet the moment I put my arms down onto it. Second flaw. Our sever was very nice, I noticed he was one of the older people working cause it is full of younger people so it was nice to have someone who seemed like they knew what they were doing rather than the hostess's who forgot we had a reservation. He told us the deals and we ordered ASAP since we were hungry. We both got the linguine clams. And the order of oysters for their Tuesday deal. The oysters came out first and were great. Next was the pasta, and keep in mind I was very excited to eat here for the 50% off and how they were posting their pastas! I must tell you, it is nothing compared to photos! It is so small! I would've got full off the oysters easier than the pasta. My boyfriend and I finished it way too fast and we were trying to make it last but we couldn't. We even ended up ordering more oysters cause we weren't full. I had such high hopes for this place but such an annoying chain of events. The hostess's were just rude. Food was good but False advertisement. My favorite thing probably was our nice server and the little candle on the table! Lol. I would go there again for the oysters. That's about it though.",

    "text": "Wanting this to beautiful restaurant to do well in this local's casino that always seems change their restaurants. But the nice looking food for what we paid- ehhhh.  First of all, the food took quite a long time for our table at 7:45 pm for a 1/2 filled restaurant. No apologies or follow up by our server for the 35 min wait for our appetizers. It was our runner who actually apologized for the delay in our appetizers and after a few bites, had followed up with us. Still no server. Another 15 min go by and the adult entrees arrive. The kids food- $10 grilled cheese & tomato soup- still missing. How long does it take to make a grilled cheese? I'd rather the kids food be made before our entrees if that is the case. After 1 taste of the tomato soup, the kids complain- tastes \"burnt.\" I tried it- definitely the soup tasted burnt. We flag down our server who takes our soup away, follows up with us that the tomato soup is meant to have a smoky taste to it since its \"made in a wood burning oven.\" Soup made in an oven? Did they forget about it and burn it? It was not even a smoky tasting soup- it was a burnt soup. And kids menu did not specify smoked tomato soup, or they would have passed. Our server had offered to make another soup for the kids. No thanks. They have already waited an hour to get their first soup. Both kids declined and you would think our server would offer a treat or something on the house for disappointed hungry kids. Nothing. So I decided to order dessert- lemon poppy seed donuts (holes) based on a yummy looking yelp pic. Ummm- the yelper got more donuts holes than we did? They got 5-6 donuts. We got 3. 3 donut holes for $8. Had I known I would have gotten 2 orders so each of us could've eaten a donut. This restaurant that is situated in a local's area, definitely needs a manager to follow up with tables if food is dragging or issues with food if they want the neighbors to support it.",

I am having a hard time deciding where to start. 1. Reservations were completely screwed up. 2. Hostess (hostesses) are basically clueless. Gave 90% of the customers to 2 waiters, instead of dividing between 5 of them! Result: frustrated, overworked waiter and slow service. But he was friendly. Acoustics in the restaurant are terrible! Can't hear s**t anyone sitting close to you say. But you do hear constant loud noise from the rest of the diners. Sorta like a few dozen of parakeets screeching... On top of that, there's also a live music band, starts around 7:30 pm?  If you're there with anyone else, just eat, don't expect a conversation, unless you are monologueing, and not expecting an answer. Our waiter said he will lose his voice by the end of the night. Last, not least, the food. I started with their version of Caprese salad appetizer with Heirloom tomatoes and burrata cheese, at $14 it was the best dish there. Shrimp putanesca for main course. That was underwhelming. The sauce was very oily, pasta undercooked (not just al dente), and contained a small number of shrimp, which were overcooked & dried out. My friends were not impressed with any of their dishes either. I would consider giving them another try, just to be fair, but for sure, not on a Friday night!",

If people were attired in waist coats and formal attire, it would be ideal. It's a beautiful space.   The bucatelli was al dents and enhanced with shelled crab. The Branzino came deboned. The wood-roasted asparagus had a wood roasted flavor. Everything was delicious and well prepared.   Service by Nolani and staff was exceptionally attentive.   I highly recommend Bottiglia for your dining pleasure.",

Being able to watch the kitchen work while we enjoy the fruits of the labor is wonderful to watch as someone who is in the industry and loves being on the line.   Kobee was absolutely fantastic! He even started us off with a free glass of Blood Orange Mimosa on top of a full carafe of it. He was a wonderful server!   I ordered a shrimp cocktail to start and the shrimp was HUGE! It was so delicious and so worth it when the shrimp were so plump and moist. You can tell the cocktail sauce is made there in house and it was the best cocktail sauce I've ever had to accompany the shrimp. It was the perfect balance between sweet and tangy.   Never before had I eaten Eggs Benedict but when I saw the prosciutto eggs Benedict I HAD to order it. I believe it will now set the standard for me. The potatoes on the side were delicious - not too salty, hard, or mushy. I loved them!   I will definitely be back to enjoy even more of Bottiglia. There was so much on the menu I have to try. Definitely look forward to my next visit!",

It was a busy Saturday night but we managed to sneak a time slot so we thought why not try again!  Wow! Were we surprised. The level of service we received was top notch. It's good though because the restaurant is not a fine dining atmosphere, much more casual (if you want it to be).  I thought the Vespa up front was a perfect photo opportunity. Last time we entered from the Patio and didn't notice.   Once we were sat we were greeted by Kobee.. extra E! He was more that happy to indulge us with great recommendations. Char grilled octopus was fantastic! Perfect texture and balance of flavors. Entrees were a little behind, but that's okay! It was a busy night. Drinks were delivered as we needed them.  I will look forward returning in the spring time to try out that patio Bottiglia.",

The hosts and waiters are all well trained and do an amazing job giving the customers an amazing experience.  DRINKS: Their bar has it all going on! They not only have all the normal drinks, but their specialty drinks are well executed with unique tastes and adorable presentation. If you're not into alcohol, the Pomegranate Basil Limeade is my favorite!  FOOD: Their appetizers and cheese plates are delicious and make a great shareable plates. They are best accompanied by a glass of wine. The salad served family style is the best deal on their menu because it is a large portion for the price. Everything else on the menu I feel is over-priced and not that good. Finger foods are the best here.  *TIP: Get a Green Valley Player's Card for great deals and coupons in the mail*",

It was convenient that some of the family was able to have a turkey dinner and the others could still order off the menu.   I had the Thanksgiving tasting menu. It was started off with a choice of soup or salad. I had the butternut squash soup with turkey meatballs. Some of the best turkey meatballs I have ever had. My dad went with the fall pear salad. It had prosciutto and a whipped mascarpone. Nice presentation.   Next course was the turkey dinner. Very flavorful dark meat underneath a few slices of white breast. Some type of cream truffle green beans that were so good and I do not care for truffle.. stuffing, mashed potatoes and a great cranberry sauce. Too filling.   For dessert there was vanilla gelato with pumpkin panacotta. Great way to end the meal with something lighter.   The meal was coursed perfectly and the staff was great. No one likes working on Thanksgiving but everyone had a smile and was friendly.   Thank you Bottiglia you know I'll be back",

The food is still good but God, the service is fucking terrible. I came here for brunch for a friend's birthday and we were the ONLY large party. Barely any other tables, maybe like 2 other ones with 3 per. TOPS!  I drank ALL of this water before the server decided to refill my water and when she decided to, she asked \"which one was yours?\" and refills ONLY ONE!! WTF??? I DRANK ALL THIS WATER U THINK ONE IS GOING TO HOLD ME DOWN AFTER YOU TOOK ALMOST AN HOUR TO REFILL MY FIRST ONE??  Also, my friend who had work 2 hours after our reservation ordered a salad thinking she would be able to eat with us. Later to for us to find out that her salad was the LAST thing to come out and she was not able to eat with us and we had to ask for it to-go.  I don't usually write reviews and I never care to learn the server's name but I really wish I did learn her name because I saw her in plain sight flirting with another server so to that girl, if you're reading this, this is why you didn't get a tip on a $200ish tab.

    "text": "This place was overpriced and had poor quality of food.  The $7 happy hour menu was a joke and had about five items on it.  We had calamari ($14), gnocchi ($22) (with added chicken $4), and veal masala ($32).  The gnocchi was the better of the items.  The marinara sauces that came with the calamari was watery and had little flavor.  The gnocchi was not too bad but the sauce was watered down and had little flavor.  I was disappointed with the veal because the sauce was thin and had little flavor.  It was also tough and almost as flatten as a quarter.  The veal was so lonely on the plate, because it did not come with any side.  For $32 they could have added a side salad and pasta.  Pasta is inexpensive enough to add to a dish.  This place was just cutting corners and being cheap!  I do not know what kind of place they are running but man the sure know how to stretch their sauces by watering them down.  The wait staff was friendly enough, but I felt very rushed.  We did not even finish our calamari and they were trying to clear the table.  They asked us twice if we were done with the dish even with food still in it.  We even had to ask for bread.  I would not go back to this place and would not recommend it to anyone.  The sad part was that my wife was so excited about going to this place and she was disappointed with the dinner.",

The other is Pizza Rock which focuses more on pizzas. Bottiglia has more of a pasta menu which is pretty nice. Some of the pastas are even made in-house, so make sure to ask your server if you're into that kinda stuff.   The ambiance is really nice. It's more upscale than Pizza Rock and has a more elegant feel to it, without being too stuffy. I like how they did the interior.  The food is solid. There are some things that I really like, and some others that I didn't really care for. I've tried most of their pastas and thought they were good. They also have some really tasty apps like the squash blossoms.   Bottiglia has a real solid wine list and cocktail program. I tried the Italian Stallion cocktail and thought it had really great balance. Their house wines are decent as well.  I would recommend this place for anyone who wants a night out for some Italian food that is not pizza. They have some interesting entrees which sound appetizing.",

    "text": "I have been to Bottiglia Enoteca about half a dozen times now. Every time is fantastic. The food, service and ambiance is perfect. The hostess at front was friendly and brought us to our table promptly. Our server Alexis is AMAZING, we have had her a couple times now and definitely recommend that you request her if you want top notch service. Even the manager went over to Borracha to get a bottle of Grey Goose Le Poire (Pear) so that they could make me my favorite martini a Grey Good Pear Martini with a splash of St Germaine. We then ordered a dozen oysters (Tuesdays are $1 oyster nights) which were fresh and tasty and they serve it with cocktail sauce and a delicious mignonette. Split their burrata caprese salad (the pistachio pesto is a great addition) and an order of calamari (served with a simple marinara sauce and a separate aioli of some kind). Then ordered the wild mushroom tagliatelle and the king crab buccatini. Both were delicious and I would definitely recommend the wild mushroom tagliatelle to anyone, it is AMAZING. The king crab buccatini was good, however the lemon was a little too overpowering and I believe the dish would be better with a different pasta, a lighter angel hair perhaps. Overall you will experience a great meal and service when you visit Bottiglia. Visit their website to see what special deals they have going on. I know they have happy hour M-F 5-7p, Tuesdays are dollar oysters, and Sunday they have brunch with all you can drink mimosas and bellinis. Every once and a while they will even have a day where all the pastas are half off. Check it out!",

Let's talk about bottomless mimosas (a ton of flavors), and really delicious food (that came with reeeeeeally delicious jam). The staff was kind and very good looking (which is always a plus).  The manager was on top of it at all times.  I've been in the service industry for a long time so you start to notice these things.  He came by multiple times to make sure everything was going good, that everything was cooked and made to our liking and just to ask how our weekends were going. Talk about customer service.   The peach mimosa was by far my favorite (but they were all really good) and the jam you get with your toast was unbelievable.  I could eat it on it's own.  Every meal that came to our table was devoured and every mimosa was finished as we were ready for the next flavor to try.   I HIGHLY recommend going to Bottiglia, you will not regret it.  The environment is awesome and is decorated so uniquely. It's super refreshing and you can't help but feel comfortable and inspired all at once.",

On my last visit I had the Wild Mushroom Tagliatelle and it was off the hook. I always seek something with meat but this pasta dish just blew me away. I also tried the grilled octopus as an appetizer but it was a bit different from what I expected. I suggest you always ask tour server to briefly describe how the dish is made or just dig into the yelp photos for details. A must have I discovered on my last visit is the Panna Cotta dessert. Oh and did I mention the staff is super friendly and accommodative :) Having dinner with a 2 and 4 year old worked out just fine!",

We tried the following: King crab bucatini - creamy, meaty...quite pricey but quality is there. Linguini Vongole - light, yet so satisfying.  The clams were fresh and plump. Dessert platter - strawberry panna cotta, tiramisu, lemon poppy seed donuts, all delicious! Oysters - On a Tuesday, these oysters from Washington was at $1/each (regularly priced at $3).  Fresh and delightful...I can finish 2 dozens on my own.  Currently in November, they are offering 50% off pasta from Mon-Thurs.",

He offered many wine selections and was very knowledgeable with the menu. He made great recommendations and informed us about the $1 oyster special of the day. Also, if you check in with yelp.. you'll get a free glass of wine (you're welcome).   Came here because of the 50% off all pasta during the month of November.   What I ordered:  Krab lemon pasta (it was delicious!)   Lots of oysters! ($1 on tuesdays)  Pinot Grigio (free w/ check in)   The lemon pasta was so good and filling. It had just the right hint of lemon and cream taste to it. Light and yet satisfying. I highly recommend it.  Oysters tasted so fresh, I just wanted to keep eating more of it hehe Overall, our experience was great. Our server was so attentive and our water was always refilled.",

    "text": "I've been to Bottiglia twice and my most recent visit really impressed! Service from Zack was great, the patio is gorgeous for the weather we're having, and most of the food was delicious. Add in that they have a free glass of wine with Yelp check in, dollar oysters on Tuesday, and a decent HH menu, and I am down to return regularly!  First visit was for a networking happy hour event and the small bites didn't impress but the space was gorgeous. Yelp reviews were mixed, I had no urgency to return until I saw their National Pasta Day promo for half-off pasta dishes. Made reservations with two friends and spent a couple hours sipping and noshing.  The apps are solid, from the bread plate with a sweet honey butter to the gorgeous charcuterie plate we got (burrata with double bresaola and truffle honey FTW!). The oysters were super fresh, too. The meatballs from the HH menu were the only thing that underwhelmed, great texture but not as much flavor in the meat or sauce, but they have strong competition next door for this dish.  Moving on to the pastas! Don't sleep on the side of Carbonara Mac & Cheese, which was a hit at our table. The creamy cheese sauce sticks to the trumpet-shaped campanelle pasta well, and the guanciale-bacon combo packs a punch of flavor. If you choose to go with a meat/seafood main, this still lets you get your carb fix. As for the pasta entrees, the Shrimp Puttanesca was decent and meaty with a hearty sauce, a touch of heat, and tons of shrimp. Unfortunately, the veal ravioli was extremely bland and the sauce was broken. Per menu description, there was allegedly truffle cream involved and ricotta inside, but our trio detected none of those flavors. Zack helpfully asked to switch out this dish, but we declined.  Overall, I was pleased with this redeeming visit, but the various discounts and promotions surely helped. Looking forward to a revisit for the pappardelle bolognese and the octopus app.  TIP: If you missed out on National Pasta Day, they're running similar discounts in early November!",

I wish the weather was nice enough to sit out on the patio. Prices were on the high end but the food was definitely worth it! I had the wild Mushroom Tagliatelle, which I have to say was he best Italian dish I've personally had-so flavorful and rich! The portions are fairly reasonable too. My boyfriend had the Linguini Vongole, which came with plentiful clams. Good service, casual romantic setting, and top notch food! I've already recommended a few couples to check it out when they come to visit. I love that they also have a few vegetarian and Vegan options. Will definitely be planning to come back.",

    "text": "I'll admit that it's easier to give five stars after experiencing a trifecta of special pricing, but I can't say that I've had better Italian food recently if ever.  Bottiglia Cucina & Enoteca is an Italian restaurant that opened last year on the Paseo Verde side of Green Valley Ranch. Except for Sunday brunch, they're only open for dinner. Reservations are taken and seem to be necessary on special occasions, but we were able to get bar seating for 3 despite being told that it'd take over 2.5 hours to get a table.  Today was National Pasta Day, and they had a 50% off deal that surely drew crowds all night long. It also happened to be Oyster Tuesday, with fresh shucked oysters available for $1. They're (intentionally) on the smaller side, and a few pieces were quite miniscule, but they were sweet and went will with any of the accompaniments: the standard cocktail sauce, the alternative that somewhat resembled fish sauce, or just a small squeeze of lemon. Only fault was the presence of broken shell pieces in several bites.  Complimentary bread was enjoyable, especially the crispy cheese cracker. The crunchy thin \"breadstick\" was okay, and the two baguette end pieces were good. The real star was the honey butter, which had a hint of citrus and was so addictive that I almost completely forgot that the Italian take on this app usually comes with an olive oil and balsamic sauce. Oh well. I preferred the honey butter anyway.  It was also happy hour (5-7pm on weekdays), so I got the happy hour meatballs ($7 for 2 pc.). Assuming that Yelp photos of regular menu meatballs ($14 for 3 pc.) are correct, then I actually did get a decent discount, although my first thought was that these had better be the best meatballs that I've ever had for $3.50 a pop. Turns out that this was exactly the case, with a moist and soft yet thoroughly delicious ground meat playing well against the balanced tomato \"gravy.\"  We each ordered a pasta to take advantage of the special. I settled on the Spinach Lasagna ($22 regular price), a simple preparation with ricotta, mozzarella, and a tomato sauce. It was surprisingly fantastic, and I wouldn't have longed for meat at all even if I'd not ordered the meatballs. Also, neither this nor the other pastas would be filling enough alone for a dinner.  I also tried two other entrees. The King Crab Bucatini ($32) is one of those dishes where I'd probably always long for more protein, but my one bite had al dente pasta, great cream sauce, a piece of delicious roasted tomato, and fresh crab. The Pappardelle Bolognese ($26) had a plentiful amount of yet another balanced sauce, as well as an al dente preparation of the only pasta on the menu that's actually made in-house. If I suddenly developed some sort of cheese allergy, then I could be happy with either of these.  We decided to split dessert, a sampler ($15) which included small portions of three treats made in-house (I think; check with Michael K. in case he paid more attention). The strawberry panna cotta was smooth and not too sweet. The tiramisu had that rum flavor which so many preparations lack, although maybe the espresso was lost in favor of the chocolate shavings. The lemon poppyseed donuts (3 pc.) were much closer to muffins in density, but are enjoyable regardless, whether alone, with a dollop of the mixed berry compote, or with a pour of the other, fruit-based sauce (guava and strawberry, perhaps).  Decor was bright with light colors, or at least we had plenty of lighting until they dimmed the lights at dusk. It still wasn't too dark at that point. TVs adorn each side of the bar and at least one of the other interior walls, and national broadcasts of both hockey and basketball were airing (although everything was reportedly switched to baseball playoffs later - sigh). The patio could be interesting, but I don't typically care for outdoor seating, and I was quite happy with the frequent and attentive bar seating service. Pacing and speed of food was great too.  Bottiglia does feel like a Strip-priced restaurant, but the quality of the food was commensurate. I certainly don't have the budget to visit often, but I'd return for a special occasion or if I wanted to be assured of having great pasta.",

UGH it was $8.00 for a apple sausage link that probably came from a package which can be bought for about that price!  I wasn't happy about that, when there is a additional charge servers should state that!   My friend I was with ordered the lobster eggs benedict, while he said it was good however the price was also ridiculous at $32.00.    I can say I've eaten here, but never will again.  I can't justify the price for a simple meal that can be purchased elsewhere for a lot less that taste just as good, or maybe even better.",

We decided to go based off of the menu change and the mood for Italian food.  We were NOT disappointed. I had a cocktail called Off to the Races and started w a prosciutto carpaccio appetizer that was outstanding. Balsamic/arugula/prosciutto ratio was perfect.  My entree was veal ossobuco. Very tender, perfectly cooked and great polenta. My lady ordered risotto frutti di mare (seafood risotto) which may have stolen the whole show. Risotto is so often undercooked or mishandled. This one was cooked perfectly and had that seafood flavor that was spot on. The quality of the calamari and shrimp along with the flavor of red sauce made the dish.   What stood out the most was the service from our waiter Nick. Honesty when recommending dishes when we couldn't decide and just overall consideration were exceptional, even for Vegas restaurant service.  I've been here 5 times over the past few years and this experience tonight was by far my favorite.  Highly recommended if you're craving Italian food, good cocktails, and awesome service.",

We love to eat, my boyfriend is a die hard Italian food lover and it's incredibly hard to find places that I get No complaints. Bottiglia seemed to be one of those places with well made food, fresh ingredients. Fast service! And what topped our experience off even more is Kevin our server table touched just the right amount of times. He was pleasant and helped make our experience. Upon leaving Alexis was sooooo knowledgeable about the restaurant , the specials , and did a phenomenal job of ensuring we would come back. Someone is doing it right! Cheers to good food, good wine, good company!",

Their brunch and dinner have some incredible vegetarian options that truly allow you to taste variety in thier menu. You have to try thier french toast! Perfect treat to Sunday Brunch.  On a side note, Bottiglia is a very slow paced environment so this is not the best place for groups in a rush to eat or that come Bottiglia ravenous. It seems that their goal is to provide an environment that will get you talking and engaged with your party. However, not knowing this upfront could completely create a misconception about dining here so make sure you have time to sit down and really take in the atmosphere they create for you.  Bottiglia is perfect for Sunday Brunch, and Group get togethers, Networking Dinners,  Bachelorette Partys, Baby Showers, & Bridal Showers. A total must see!",

Sadly, we will go to any other restaurant in GVR before visiting Bottiglia ever again.",

We told the waiter, he took the plate back and returned the same plate about 2 minutes later. *No offer to take the coffee or eggs off the bill. The $14 French Toast was OK. In the end, they weren't sure which bill to give us. Maybe we'll try it again, but not at the bar? Still, very nice looking place.",

We ate around 5:30 and the lighting inside was beautiful. Really well decorated place. I have lots of experience in the food and beverage industry and wow am I impressed! My wife and I try to stay away from unhealthy foods like fatty pastas the majority of the time so we were pleased to see the menu featured plates with more healthy options. Our server , Coby, gave a personal recommendation of the grilled salmon to my wife. She was considering the chop salad with shrimp added but she was so please to have the delicious quinoa salad that paired nicely with the salmon. I myself enjoyed the tuna tartare and spaghetti squash as entrees.  We will certainly visit again on a Thursday to enjoy wine.",

The reso was made with a time constraint, and we weren't finished in time. Most restaurants will have two servers to a table if the party is large. I think the service would have been much smoother and quicker with two servers. The food runners weren't very sure of their seat numbers so food was being given to the wrong customers. I could tell our server was stressed out, however, he was polite the whole time. This restaurant needs more practice with larger parties. The food was very impressive and I truly enjoyed the calarmi, octopus, chicken piccata, macaroni and cheese, tomato soup, etc. It was all very good. We came for a birthday and one of the food runners (Isaiah) sang for us in Italian and it was such a special moment for our friend. The servers really seem to enjoy what they do and it was much appreciated. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a nice dinner with a beautiful environment. I will be coming back.",

I can't wait to come here for an actual meal because I suspect it will be fantastic.  They do brunch as well so maybe I'll try that as well!",

    "text": "Wow! If I could give this place 6 stars... I would! I absolutely loved the interior decor and lounge area (not to mention there's also a killer patio)   We sat in the lounge and ordered several items off the happy hour and regular menus. During happy hour they offer 6$ glasses of house red and white wines and they're actually pretty decent! Not your usual happy hour crap!  Appetizers we tried: The Charcuterie plate, zucchini flowers, meatballs, heirloom tomato bruschetta and the arancini- they were all top notch.   Based of off my servers recommendation, for my entree, I had the pappardelle with short rib bolognese.  Pasta was extremely fresh and cooked perfectly. The bolognese sauce had large pieces of rich short rib wasn't too fatty or salty, it was perfect.   The manager, Javier was very kind and you can tell he really cares about the restaurant and customers. All that to say, Bottiglia is still new but they've got their food, vibe and management dialed in! I will definitely be back",

I call the Stuffed Zucchini Flower, zucchini flower bomb! It's filled with some kind of cream cheese concoction, breaded and deep fried. The flavors and texture of this is just superb!  The Lobster Diavolo is my ultimate favorite item on the menu. You get large bite size chunks of lobster in the pasta dish, plus the head of the lobster which is very tasty. The burst of flavors from the lobster and perfectly al dente pasta is what will keep me coming back.  Wait, I take that back. The white sangria will also keep me coming back. Get a pitcher, because it is too delicious to have just one glass. It tastes as pretty as it smells. The floral scent in this sangria will keep you mesmerized.  Definitely a new fave spot in Henderson.  One thing I do wish they had: a kid's menu. I'd love to come here with my family, and that includes 3 small children.",

We started off with:  Zucchini Flowers - Wasn't really feeling the lemon with the ricotta with the zucchini flower...ok dish app at best...  Arancini - Good....almost if not better than Nora's Arancini  Charcuterie - Is there really such a thing as a bad charcuterie plate?  Baked Gnocchi Arrabbiata - Sauce on this is fire with a little kick to it...the consistency of the Gnocchi may not be for everyone but basically it is similar to Japanese Mochi...fire  Sausage & Rapini - Spicy sausage over pasta which is fiarly good  Pan Roasted Halibut - This is a highly recommended dish...doesn't even taste like fish, seared well with a lot of flavor...excellente  NY Style Cheesecake - Done very well, big portion for sure  Donuts - Donut holes but far from the best ones I ever had...at this point in the meal it was too difficult to eat  Overall between the atmosphere and food this place is pretty good and a great addition to Green Valley's emerging roster as one of the best restaurant offerings in a local property.",

The service was impeccable; not annoyingly frequent but she was present when needed. The wine list, albeit not very extensive, it was decent and the Pinot Noire glass I had was very good.  For appetizer, I had the tomato soup; it was excellent. For entree, I had the Gnocchi Arrabbiata. It was spicy and the amount of heat was just perfect.  I cannot rate dessert as I was stuffed and had no room for it.  Very good restaurant.",

    "text": "Terribly disappointed in the food and service. I chose this restaurant for Valentine's dinner based on many great reviews from friends.   Our waitress brought us menus after we'd been seated for over 10 minutes. She explained everything and left without taking our drink order. She returned to fill water glasses and still didn't take our drink order. 13 minutes later we saw her point at us as if she totally forgot she was our waitress. We ordered drinks, apps, and entrees. We received the appetizers before we got our drinks, which we had to ask the server who brought the apps for because she clearly forgot.   The crispy calamari sat on a bed of what looked like fryer scraps. Calamari is not supposed to be served like that. It also did not come with a lemon garnish. I've never been served calamari without lemon to squeeze on it. The Brussels Sprouts were yummy, although she said they came with pine nuts and ours did not.  I ordered the halibut. They were two very small pieces compared to the 3 photos in Yelp. It was by far the driest halibut I've ever had. The risotto it sat on was room temperature, not the slightest bit warm. The carrot and pea puree were tasty.   We decided to have dessert elsewhere since our experience/food were not pleasant.   Also, we found it a bit odd that the servers did not have more professional attire. Black slacks would look so much nicer than jeans. And the waitress with her phone hanging out of her back pocket was extremely distasteful. We will not be back!",

The ambiance is upscale with a casual feel though. We were brought warm bread and crispy parm as soon as we ordered our drinks. For appetizers, we shared the beef and prosciutto carpaccio  and the wood roasted cauliflower. Both which were spectacular. For my main entree I had the King Crab Bucatini. This dish was so tasty that I didn't want to eat it on the basis that I did not want the dish to come to an end! The rest of the table also ordered spinach lasagna, and the baked gnocchi arribbiata. Both again, such great dishes! (At least, the only ones I was able to try without getting reprimanded by the others, so tasty!!) I also ordered the 2013 Napa Valley Annabella bottle of Cabernet which tied the experience together in such a refined way. To end our meal, we ordered every desert on the menu. Including the sampler so we got to enjoy every tasty dessert available. From cannolis, to doughnuts, to cheesecake, to everything haha.  Inside the GVR, this is a hidden gem! Such a nice place to relax and enjoy the company of your friends and/or family!",

There are TV's throughout and they have outdoor seating with misters. The staff was very friendly and we were checked on often by them and the management. Their menu is not pricey and have some nice food & wine selections. We had the Halibut & Risotto and Chicken Parmigiana. The halibut was moist and flakey, risotto was perfect and the chicken was moist and flavorful, not dry like some other places we've patronized. Dessert was a tasty Tiramisu with Cookie. A very good dining experience and we look forward to returning again.",

People come to restaurants to enjoy the food and converse.  We had considered having our \"girls night out\" at this restaurant, but know that with 6 to 7 at a table, we wouldn't be able to hear each other.

There were TVs all over the place, though, which killed the mood of the cute wine bar feel. It caused a weird clash and seemed like the focus was on sports instead of company. The table came with assorted breads. Nobody complained about them but nobody ate much. Everyone got drinks, wine or beer. My husband was not impressed by the beer but I had a red wine and it was pretty good.  The menu was rather small. And the food was small, too! I ordered the beet salad and it turned out to be half of a beet cut up and garnished with lettuce. It tasted good, although for the price I would have expected 'great', but there was just so little of it that it was disappointing. Almost everyone else got steak or a pot roast and mashed potatoes. Their meal size was also pretty small. I could have very easily eaten 3 of those meals and I'm not even a giant eater. My family passed me pieces of their plates as they pitied my itty bitty salad. I tried almost everyone's meat and it tasted pretty yummy.  Overall we were not impressed and we left hungry.",

In the past, always had wrong or missing dishes.  The temperature of the restaurant was actually appropriate.  In the past, it was so cold we actually asked for additional table candles to warm our hands.  Now for the issues.  The hot food is never hot.  Aside from the cold seafood and salads, most dishes we have tried have not been very good.  This time pasta and eggplant were terrible.  We always seem to have an issue with at least one of our main courses.  And it's not an issue of price, as always free thanks to a comp.  But even for free, still a pass.",

The bread service was immediate and the water was filled the moment we were sat which was also a small wait nothing more than 3 minutes which was great. We ordered the calamari, which was great and crispy. For entrees we ordered the chicken piccata and gnocchi arrabiatta which was great and the sauces went great with the bread to add some amazing flavors. For dessert we ordered the dessert sampler which was a great deal for the amount of desserts you get it came with the lemon curd donuts, strawberry panna cotta which with the strawberry sauce was amazing, by far my favorite. The last dessert was the tiramisu which was also a great dessert and my girlfriends favorite for sure. Definitely a place I would revisit and recommend to others for good service and a great dinner.",

Took too long to take drink and food orders, forgot bread, tried several times to removes plates before done, and forgot to honor the birthday girl, among other snafus.  The staff was nice enough but not trained enough.  Perhaps the A team was on vacation the night before Thanksgiving.  Pork chops plump and tasty.  Rabe perfectly spicy.  Shortribs flavorful and tender.  Tomatoes in caprese sweet. Garlic Lavosh crisp.  Bottom line, would like owner to reply with commitment to improve flow of service before I return.  Has potential that was not displayed on Nov 23.",

My husband asked for a table.  The two hostesses sneered at him and said we'd have to sit outside--in 110-degree heat!  We declined, of course, but we were both just aghast.  If they don't want senior citizens in there, they shouldn't buy advertising aimed at us.",

Make sure to order the zucchini flower appetizer. You won't regret it. Make sure to make a reservation. They have tvs strategically placed so you can take your love on a romantic date but still watch the game. Put the kids in kids quest and you have a winner!",

    "text": "For a restaurant that has only been open a very short time this one seems to have gained quite a following.  At 6 PM on Tuesday the place was absolutely packed-not a seat available.  Three friends and I had dinner here tonight and have to say this is a winner with one exception. Friend number one had halibut and it was very dry and overdone. Halibut is a delicate fish and there's a fine line between perfect and overdone this one definitely crossed the line. The rest of us had Veal Marsala which we all really liked.  Oddly enough they used enoki mushrooms instead of button or cremini mushrooms but the veal  was tender and the sauce was excellent. We ordered pasta side dishes, I ordered pappardelle with Bolognese sauce expecting to get a very small side order since everything is a la carte but side order was very generous. Sadly the Bolognese was not True Bolognese sauce which is made with the addition of milk-this one wasn't but was still a very good sauce.  Caesar salads  were very fresh and the dressing was excellent. Olive bread and sourdough bread basket could have been heated but was served cold although it was very fresh. The addition  of lemon flavored butter was a real taste treat.  I wish I could remember the name of our server - he was a young black man who really knew his way around serving. Very personable, brought our orders out immediately and checked on us to make sure everything was OK. We're going to look for him again the next time we return.  The Decor is white and pastels-very pretty but the patio is a real knockout. If it weren't so hot we would have eaten out there for sure. Definitely next time because we will be back Oh one more thing: the red sangria is out of this world but a little too pricey.",

The bread pudding was not too sweet and very fresh and a nice twist on a classic dish. The asparagus were great as a side as well.
