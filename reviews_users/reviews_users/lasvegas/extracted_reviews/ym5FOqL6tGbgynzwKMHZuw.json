Oysters on the half shell for $1/each, mozzerella sticks for $5, calamari fries for $6, $3 domestic draft beers and well drinks, $2 off wine and $1 off other beers. Good deals in general. We also tried the po boy fried shrimp sandwich and the soft shell crab sandwich - both came with house made chips and were generous portions. The service was very good and they had a pretty high tech setup where the servers put your order into an app on their phone to order it immediately from the kitchen. I like the relaxed atmosphere and Maryland theme with a beach vibe - even smells like you're near the sea!",

    "text": "As a DC/MD/VA-area native, I perk up when I come across anything or anyone that reminds of it. I, like many from there, grew up crabbing and eating Maryland blue crabs which have a distinct buttery-sweet flavor. Steam them up in a pot with generous handfuls of Old Bay season and I'm your best friend! I travel to Vegas a few times a year from L.A. One day recently, I found myself watching a video on ways to eat blue crabs and ended up watching one from a guy who owned 2 restaurants in Vegas. WHAT?? Blue crabs in Vegas?? Sure, there are places that serve the meat in dishes (crab cakes, sushi) but I haven't heard of any that steam them and serve (dump) them on your butcher-paper-covered table with vinegar, extra seasoning, a mallet and crab knife like this place does--Chesapeake Bay-style. The peel-and-eat shrimp was also good. The boardwalk fries (similar to the ones sold at Thrasher's in Ocean City, MD) did kinda take me back. The crabs? Mouth-wateringly, finger-licking good! Although the spice blend they use isn't actually Old Bay, it's very similar. The vinegar cups they give you even have tiny peppers in them to spice it up. Plenty of DC/MD memorabilia all over so it made me feel a little bit at home. The only caveat to me was the service: although attentive and prompt, they were not terribly friendly or engaging. I wasn't expecting them to be super outgoing but still felt kinda like we were just given the food and the check and that was it. I might be able to understand somewhat if it were busy, but it wasn't while we were there. Regardless, I truly hope this place survives and sticks around for years. I appreciate the DC/MD/VA pride in the middle of the desert!",

    "text": "Lots and lots and lots of deep fried food!!!   Let me start off by saying that the food at Crab Corner is not my thing. I'm not big on fried foods. At all. If you like deep fried everything (especially seafood) then, seriously, look no further.   This place is very large.  It has lots of space, several TVs, a big bar and a great patio. The smell (seafood) is very strong when you walk in the door which kind of killed my appetite a little. The staff is great.  There was one guy, who was playing host, waiter, and bus boy.  He was doing an excellent job too - very friendly and super quick.   We ate:  Boardwalk Fries - Pretty tasty and very well seasoned.  Cod - This was beer battered and fried. By far the heaviest thing we ordered.  Catfish - \"Lightly\" breaded and fried. Onion Rings  Hush Puppies Pretty much all of this tasted the same and all of it tasted like greasy breading with the exception of the Cod which had a nice vinegar finish.  I kind of dug it, but I was starting to feel really gross by the time I tasted this.  My husband really liked the hush puppies (I thought they were kind of so so) and he also thoroughly enjoyed his soft shell crab sandwich.    I HATE to give such a low star review and was fully prepared to 3 star this place and move on. Then, hoping to salvage the meal by treating myself to a rare something sweet, I ordered the only dessert on the menu - the snow ball.  I'm sorry but this thing was unforgivable.  If you are going to put a snow cone on your restaurant menu, it should probably be a dang good snow cone. I've had better ones served to me by 9 year olds at little league games.   I Probably will not return.",

So we went back to treat a friend on her birthday. The food was still superb and reasonable but the service was only so-so. A nice young man named Jared seemed to be busy but I don't know with what. We went late so they weren't crowded. Still I was done with my lunch by the time he asked if I wanted more tea. We were obviously there for a special occasion (wrapped presents, decorated cupcakes, etc.) and most restaurants would have taken note of that. My friend who walks with difficulty was not treated with deference (pulling out chair, taking care of her cane, etc.) Young people don't care if you can walk, just so you can pay. I'm writing all this in hopes that management actually reads their reviews because I want them to improve and then stay around for a long time.

This was not the case at all, the mussels were very tiny and had no flavor, the king crab was good but had no seasoning and was quite salty and pretty bland and the blue crab, well that was an adventure all in its own because when we finally got to the meat it wasnt worth it because there wasn't much to eat. To top it off we ate inside and somehow our food was surrounded by flies.

Instead of buying it through groupon and having them get a 50% cut on their end.  So I went it and mentioned it to the waiter. He told me I had to buy it first through groupon, AND I had to wait 4 hours before I can use it. I asked why , because that doesn't make any sense. And thats when he told me \"Groupon just doesn't allow us to have the vouchers used right away\" ..... okay but thats not True. And whoever in there thinks its a brilliant idea to lie to customers is an idiot. I have a business myself and am a groupon merchant. So I know exactly how it works and it does not require a 4 hour wait to use. It doesn't even take a person who is a merchant to know that. It's obviously a setup to force the customer to pay full price. Which is not really an issue for me , but they way the business is shady about it and lying to people is not a good way to make customers. I wanted to use the groupon to try the food, see how I like it (regardless of the bad reviews) and if I like it, ill come back and ill be happy to pay full price. I understand that the business is trying to make it and would prefer to have full paying customers, but heres the thing, What's better? $30 bucks plus a good tip ( especially to compensate for the groupon) or $0 ? Because thats what they got from me, just for lying. And just for that, I probably won't give them another chance. What could've been a chance to make a customer, they made it so unreasonable and now I'm on here . And i didn't even get the chance to try the food. but from the looks of the reviews, it looks like i didn't miss out. Heres a tip for the crab corner, if you just want full paying customers, then I suggest you take down the  campaign and quit bull shitting .",

We ate family style and there was plenty to go around.  They covered the table with brown paper and gave us all bibs and wooden mallets.  Seafood is super fresh and tastes wonderful.  Staff is very knowledgeable about the menu.  Highly recommend trying this off strip restaurant if you live in Vegas or are just visiting.",

We've never done crab maryland style so they both took the time to show us how to do it and made it a really lighthearted and silly experience. The food is a bit pricey for the quantity, especially the appetizers, but everything was tasty the crab was really yummy! We also had beer and watched football, they even put the game we wanted on, which added to the charm of this place. It is the type of place with awesome food and a chill atmosphere, we will definitely return to mallot some crabs!",

I grew up in Maryland/Virginia and worked in Ocean City, MD for years  including several in Philip's Crab House where I was a sautes chef. I know GOOD seafood.   First of all the service was definitely lacking. Let me say first though that our waiter had a great personality but then it went down hill from there. We sat for too long waiting for someone to approach the table and greet us. We then got our meal before the appetizers. Also, the drinks were forgotten and had to be asked for.  As for the food, the oysters appetizers were small, the baked shrimp dry and the fried oysters heavy and questionable on the freshness. Like I said, I know seafood.  On a personal note, I'm a graduate of the University of Maryland, grew up in the same area as the owner and worked in several of the seafood restaurants where this restaurant originated. I asked a couple of times to meet the owner to say hello. He never showed. If he was busy cooking I understand but if not there was no excuse for not coming out and greeting a guest.  We are very disappointed because we really hoped we had found a place we could call our own and bring back memories of our past.  Larry",

He was very attentive and quick.  Our party of four wanted crabs! We're all from Delaware, and two of us have been living in the desert for a couple years, missing blue crabs like crazy. We went on \"Three Dollar Thursday\", for which we ordered 2.5 dozen large males at $4 a pop (about half price off their menu board). Before they came out, we ordered two appetizers: a blue crab dip & a crab pretzel. Both were pretty good, however I felt that the same exact crab mix was used for both apps. The only difference was melted cheese was placed over the pretzel. The pretzel made me miss Philly pretzels, not the same.  With each dozen of crabs delivered to our table, we all gave various feedback from cooked perfectly to too mushy to eat. I personally ate 5 crabs and 2 of those were on the overcooked end. That seemed to be the consensus also: somewhere around 60-70% of the crabs weren't cooked to perfection. But it was worth it. We filled our bellies and were happy. We may return if the craving ever comes back, since flying home would be a lot more pricey and time consuming rather than dealing with a less than perfect cook on the crabs. Overall a great experience!",

So we were promptly greeted from the moment we walked in and seated in the bar. The waiter was nice and informative but he forgot my soup, so I never got to try it and almost forgot to take it off our ticket at the end. He also was a bit forgetful with the condiments and $2 crab that I ordered.   First we ordered the mozzarella sticks. The marinara sauce was cold but the sticks were good.  The fried oysters weren't very crispy though big in size. The green beans were flavorful and the sweet potato fries though crispy were a little bland. The best part by far was the $2 crab. Since I had no idea how to get into it they sent another waitress over to show me the ropes, that was very kind of them. The crab was fun to eat and I got lucky and had one with lots of eggs. Yum!   Overall this place was okay. If I'm ever craving crab is definitely hit up this place but stick with the crab entrees... I should've known, it's all in the name.",

Maybe you are the one who flew through BWI because clearly you have no idea what good seafood is. Insulting reviewers is in POOR taste. And I vacation ALL over the world and know what decent food is. Your place is not one of them and apparently I'm not the only one who thinks this. Landing us in a bathroom all freaking night long is just proof of the poor quality.",

I had the Maryland Crab Soup and it was very tasty. It had a good amount of crab meat. The fried oysters were cooked very well. They had just the right amount of breading and they were quite large. The only issue I have is there was too much dressing on the Ceasar Salad.   The staff was pleasant and service was good. I will come back the next time I am in Vegas.",

However from walking in the front door, they were not too busy, busy enough to not say hello, we Aalto sit on the patio...due to a small party, granted tables were available, we were denied out door seating.  We ask to sit in the bar area, we meaning my wife and I, we were denied that option because of a party may be coming in later.  So they sat us in the middle of the main walkway in a circle of families with children.  Not exactly the what we were looking for, we have children of our own however we did not come there to hang out with other people's children and inside beside a busy walkway.   I'll change this review after we return, we decided to come back another day after making a reservation for where we would like to sit.  Hopefully they have their staff in order.  We felt bad for the few staff working, the person hosting was also the bus person, server, bartending as well.  Probably wore more hats that we didn't observe.",

Perfect for when they do happy hour specials.  That's everyday!  If you check out my tip, you will see the happy hour times.  Service here is fast and friendly.  I really like the added menu.

    "text": "I was really sad to see Three Tomatoes and a Mozzarella go out of business, but excited to see a new restaurant go in. This is a really great layout, I absolutely love the outside/inside bar and patio area. The restaurant is pretty big inside with lots of TV's (they had the football games on when we were there, most people at the bar were watching).   The menu had so much to choose from, we spent more time debating on what to get than your average customer. So the plan was to get a couple things and share. This was our order:  Lobster bisque- awesome, prob one of the best I've had, tasted like I was at a strip restaurant. Not too much sherry, and the broth was delish.   Crab Cakes- outstanding. About 90% crab (real crab) and not too much breading. Sauce is excellent too.   Alaskan Cod and Fried Sea Clams-cod was excellent and I loved you could get a hint of the beer in the batter.   Soft Shell Crab-so good! Batter was good, didn't take away from the taste of the crabs.   Sides- *Hushpuppies were the best I've had (better than the ones I recently had in North Carolina) Not dry at all and had a good seasoning.  *Sweet potato fries (can't really mess those up) *Coleslaw was good but it was a tad warm, needs to be a lot colder.  *Potato salad wasn't the best I've had, a little on the plain side.   I definitely want to come back and try some of their cocktails and sit outside on their patio. They had an good specialty cocktail list.   My only gripe is, I loved the crab cakes, I just think $28 was a bit steep for them.",

After seeing average of 3.5 stars we were hesitant about it but still decided to give it a shot. It wasn't crowded at all for a Saturday night, which was surprising. We were treated very well by the staff from the minute we sat down until we left. Ordered an appetizer (crabby pretzel) and some crab legs and crabcake dinner. My husband wasn't sure how good the food is going to be but it was too late to leave. Lol  And we absolutely did NOT regret staying. His whole meal and sides and my crab legs with chips were delicious!!!! We were very pleasantly surprised!!! The prices maybe not too cheap for what you would expect from a bar/restaurant but it's worth it. Plus it's seafood. It's always a bit pricey. But this place is still quite affordable.  As a restaurant owners ourselves, we hope this place sticks around. Great food served by friendly staff in a unique place. Awesome!  Oh. And did I say our little one was so entertained by live lobsters and crabs in a tank  :)",

I have sampled most of their menu, and have yet to find anything I dislike. Please, if you come to a place called Crab Corner and order a chicken sandwich, you forfeit your right to complain. They have great happy hour specials (I believe $4 wine and beer), and a number of appetizers to choose from. Also, they have $1 Oysters during happy hour and on Sundays. Yes, their oysters are small but the texture is just right and they are always fresh. So, if you are a fan of huge, briny oysters this is not the place for you. The price point matches what you get. I've also had their calamari fries which were delicious. We have shared the garlic steam pot among four people ($49.99) and it was filled with corn, shrimp, and various types of crab. I have also had their fried soft shell blue crab and it was perfect. They offer several sides but my favorite were the fried okra and sweet potato tots. The service was great, the price point just right, and the interior was spacious with a fully stocked bar. On certain nights they host trivia there and it gets pretty packed. After having a huge feast for four, and eating what seems to be 800 pounds of crab I was shocked at how reasonable our bill was. I will most certainly be back!",

    "text": "Came here couple of times. They have great happy hours and special days....Like on Wednesday during 9PM to 10PM, they have flip it or bill it (i think that's what they call it) but basically whatever you order during that hour (drinks, beer, food, etc...) you flip a coin and you call it. If you call it right, its FREE and if not, then pay your regular bill whatever it is.   So.. lets see...  FOOD....good food, its not a fancy seafood place here. It's bar sooo yeah, seafood and beer and stuff. So don't wear your fancy shirt and pants. Food presentation is going to be basic, again it's not fancy, so don't whiny about presentation. The food here is fresh. I come here usually for happy hour because they have $4 blue crabs and $1 oyster. Its good, but the oyster are so small you need to order 2 dozen just to make you feel you ate a dozen oyster.   PRICE....its seafood, some dish are cheap and others are little expensive just depending what type of seafood you order.   PLACE...lots of parking, TV, chairs and tables. they have 3 side in that restaurant: one side is for the bar, other is for the restaurant and they also have outside tables.   STAFF... some are good and some are bad. The people who are bad are usually new staff. so obviously, they're still learning. So I cant really complain. Btw, read what on their shirt says...(pretty funny)!  One bad time... i had was when i order blue crab cake entree, and they had a little side salad. in that salad....a big huge dead moth....they gave me like 10% or 25 % off for that meal. But i still afraid to finish the remainder of the food, so i barely ate half of the meal. so i felt it's not fair just getting 10 or 25 % off for a meal i barely ate half of.",

Now the food...DELICIOUS...you will not be disappointed with anything on the menu, from the crab cakes, calamari, shrimp, soft shell crab(my favorite) to the real deal crab clusters, and fried catfish....we had a ball.

Crab Corner is a fun and comfortable spot with fresh fare always priced fairly enough to make it the perfect seafood restaurant for couples, families, or groups gathering to catch a sporting event. I'm a big fan of the crab specials and the myriad beers on tap (more than your average sports bar). Definitely add this spot into your seafood rotation if you're into oysters as well.   Can't wait to come back soon as management has always made a fantastic effort to make me feel welcome at Crab Corner.",

They sat me in a booth/table, the place looks like a game bar/restaurant, very relaxed. I was immediately greeted by a kind waiter and ordered my drink. Then he took my order. I got some grilled oysters and 1lb snow crab legs. They took great care of me and the food was delicious! I will definitely go back to this spot and make it my go to.  I also used the restroom while i was there, it was very clean. This place is kid friendly so bring the whole family (there is a little aquarium for the kids to enjoy). I would like to tey the blue crab next time.  I would alao like to ask for a lemon water bowl next time to relieve the seafood smell. I could smell it when i went back to work. Overall i loved this place and i will go back! I strongly recommend this location.",

Everything is super fresh and the beachy decor kind of lets you delude yourself into thinking you've taken a brief vacation. Except for the video poker built into the bar, but hey, you're still in Vegas.  Happy Hour is offered daily from 2-6PM, with buck-a-shuck oysters! Their cocktail sauce is nice and thick, and the horseradish is super spicy, but these are just as enjoyable plain. Crab cakes are a good option, and if you're feeling especially indulgent (or with a group), try the Crab Pretzel- a soft Bavarian style pretzel topped with Anapolis-style crab salad and cheese.   The steamer sampler is always a good option fora couple (or a trio!), with shrimp and three kinds of crab. I'm not the hugest fan of \"market pricing\" because you don't really have an idea how much you'll be spending (and it can really add up!), but you can certainly call before you visit. Staff have been pretty friendly when I've been in.   TIP: Blue crab + spicy vinegar = awesome!",

My food comes out and truly the 2 most pitiful looking pieces of cod come out.  My fries were just meh and salty.  I tasted the cod and it just wasn't ok.  I ate a few of the fries and literally half of the smallest piece of cod.  That was all.  The waiter did not ask if everything was ok w my meal even after I told him he could take the plate and he clearly could see I didn't eat even a fourth of the food.  He just said ok.  Ed's meal was pretty good.  Will we come back?  Probably not.  Lack of concern for why I hadn't eaten my food and the filth along the walls just didn't make me feel welcomed :(",

As soon as we got seated we were approached by our server, Richard. (Or at least that was the name on the receipt not too sure if thats his name??? Never introduced himself) mid way through walking us through the menu, he reached into his pocket to check his phone, rude. Our food was brought out all at different times, which I found weird because people usually eat at the same time.... He came around to check on us once but when we asked for some hot sauce he look annoyed???? Now at the end my boyfriend got a crab cake and 1st he never brought it out but we didn't say anything because the restaurant was sort of busy so when we got the check he then realized and brought it over and 2nd no utensils were brought... no problem because everyone forgets but we couldn't get him to look over to ask him for some....Idk it gave us a bad vibe with his personality and attitude. Hope he's a little more happy next time we come.   -- updating this as a reply to a comment left on this review. We are obviously aware of how the servers take orders, it was a personal cell phone he has checking, nice try though. Hot sauce on every table? Then why would we have had to ask him for hot sauce if it was already on the table.... This comment also adds to my point on how the customer service is, maybe some training will be provided for your staff. Would love to come try it again on a day the staff is more polite",

Laid back place that I can dress casual and eat good! We were sat right away and attended to quickly. Our waiter Jeremy was outstanding. He answered my questions about the different crab they had as there were many options and gave his opinion on what was good.   I ordered the oysters and calamari first. The oysters are $1 during happy hour 2-6 during the week and on Sunday's. I ordered 8 to start. I was really happy to see they were on the small side as I hate large chunky oysters. The flavor was so good I slurped them down In a couple minutes and ordered a dozen more to enjoy. The Calamari was some of the best I have had. Really crunchy.. Mmm. We ordered a lobster, king crab, fries and co slaw . Everything was so freaking good. It was the best meal I have had all year! Jeremy was nice enough to bring us out some blue crab to try as there was a mistake In the kitchen. We were having trouble getting the meat out so he showed us the expert way to open it. Way too much work for me but I appreciated him letting having us experience it. We topped off the meal with some rich chocolate cake. I think it was the 1st time my husband and I have cleared the table in a long time, licking our fingers on the way out.   You will definitely see me back here and with friends!",

We got the garlic blue crab for 11.99/lb which includes 3-4 crabs (small amount) but tasty. Take out was good. Also got the Brussel sprout and grilled cheese for kids and it was okay. I'll be back for sure. Fast service and quick!",

The lobster mixture had a great flavor and the side of fries made for a perfect combination!   I will definitely be visiting Crab Corner again!",

The waitress/hostess was nice however didn't offer any specials and after we ordered I noticed a chalk board with info on it and asked what it was she said oh that's the specials and crab prices of the day....which would have been good to know before we ordered our non-crab items.   My son ordered a salmon dish that had more noodles than it did fish, my husband ordered shrimp that was over battered and looked and tasted like frozen out of a box, I got the fish n chips and it had hardly any flavor to it other than salty, the tarter sauce was not very good.  Not to mention that non of their dinner dishes come with either soup or salad and it was quite pricey for just meals.   I doubt I'd try it again after seeing everyone in the place with better dishes than we had and we knew nothing about what they served and what the others had didn't look like it came from their menu?",

There were six people in our party and various aspects of the meal were good and various aspects of the meal were not so good. I had the crab cakes with the boardwalk fries .  I've had better fries at McDonald's  and the crab cakes lack flavor, however  that was easily fixed  with some butter and Tabasco . My brother had the shrimp pasta  and he stated that the shrimp was really good but the pasta itself lacked flavor, so once he ate the shrimp, he didn't want the remaining pasta .  My cousin had the  fried shrimp  with  brussel sprouts  and she stated both were really good .  My mom had the crab legs and she enjoyed them. I ordered a margarita and it was so bad that I had to send it back. The service was okay but our server could have been more attentive. The prices are reasonable. If I'm ever in the area again, I may give this place another try but I am definitely not driving 20 minutes from my house to eat here.",

Everyone had a great time and a delicious meal. I was the only one of our group who had been there before but now everyone wants to go again. Thanks for the lovely lunch.",

    "text": "My original bad review was removed for lack of specificity.  So here is the original review with all the detail a person could want:  Skip it ... trust me.  Bad food bad service, bottomless mimosas were 90% orange juice.    (1) Skip it: if you are looking to try somewhere new my recommendation is that this place should not make the list.  I was not impressed with the food the service or the overall experience.    (2) Trust me:  with extended family in Pennsylvania and Maryland I spend my summers growing up in the northeast.  My grandmother made Maryland crab cakes at home, and we tried the Maryland crab cakes at dozens of establishments across Maryland.  I am no expert but I can tell the difference between good and bad crab.   (3) Bad food: we started with the bacon wrapped scallops.  The bacon was charred and the scallops were so overdone they were rubbery and difficult to chew (if you haven't had scallops they should not be rubbery or chewy).  We then had crab dip which was not dip at all.   It was mushy crab goo piled onto small slices of bread.  The flavor left a lot to be desired and the consistency was the straw that broke the camels back.  After a bite I opted to move onto the next thing.  Now the True disappointment, the crab Benedict.  Let me first say, I LOVE crab Benedict ... just not this one.  I didn't know you could butcher the concept of fresh crab, hollandaise sauce and a poached egg, but crab corner figured out how to.  I made it about halfway through before I gave up.  The flavor left something to be desired on every front.    (4) Bad service: here is the kicker.  Had the the service been great I might have overlooked the bad food, but it simply wasn't.  There were 2 male servers sharing the responsibilities for the restaurant.  They tried to be attentive (I think) but failed miserably.  We went long periods with empty drinks (mimosas that were supposed to be bottomless, sodas, tea and water too), and plates on the table that needed to be cleared.  I also respect that many places have a limit to bottomless mimosas, but it would be nice if the only notice of that was not a waiter (who had been previously ignoring us) announcing with a less than polite tone \"you've got 20 minutes left, do you want anything else or are you done?!\"  Sure let us know we're coming to the end of our bad experience, thanks, but at least do it politely!  Our server did finally crack a smile at the end of our meal, but by then it was too late.   (5) As for the mimosas, maybe some people like a mostly orange juice with a splash of champagne.  I on the other hand, do not.  But I'll let you judge this on your own should you choose to make a trip to this skippable restaurant.    I imagine that it's reasonable to have a review removed that's not specific enough, but I doubt anybody is asking to have reviews removed that say \"this place is great\" without any details.  So I hope this review had all the details you ever wanted about my bad experience.  Happy dining!",

    "text": "**** WARNING -- BUGS ****** WORST experience ever!!! A huge COCKROACH crawled across my table. Not a small baby, a huge roach about an inch and a half long and half inch wide crawled across my table in the later half of my meal. I immediately got up, in disgust and walked away from my table. Several waiters/waitresses stood by, offering no assistance ... When I spoke to a manager (moments later) he told me I was to pay for my meal in full or he would call the cops!!! I was SO outraged. As I offered to tip my waiter accordingly, but did not feel it was right for me to pay for this meal, he called the cops on me and I stayed in the restaurant till they arrived. The cops told me if I didn't pay I would get a ticket for stealing. So I payed for the meal, and left in a complete outrage - not to mention totally disgusted. I have never experienced such unprofessional or worse treatment from an owner of a restaurant (apparently that's who I spoke to when I asked for a manager, he claimed to be the half owner)  I Will do everything in my power, to detour business from this establishment. Absolute worst restaurant experience of my life.  I only put one star because I have to, to post this review.   Before the roach appeared, I was not too impressed with the meal anyways. I had the crab cakes. Very dry and bland. I recommend The Boiling Crab or Hot & Juicy for anyone who seeks a proper seafood experience.",

Food is still terrific and they have all the same great specials the Eastside location did, and a few more to boot (all you can drink Saturday and Sunday brunch).    The service was very attentive but not overbearing, and Ashley was super friendly and courteous.  Never waited for a refill on tea or anything else despite the place being fairly crowded.  The expanded inside looks great to boot.  The other bonus for this location is there are some things to do, like gaming, video games, smoking patio and full bar.  Some people get sick of watching me crack crabs for 2 or 3 hours, so they're nice distractions.  Some of the best seafood I've had in this town and at more than fair prices.  If you're in the mood for fresh shellfish, crab cakes, or boardwalk fries, this is the place.  They're a Ravens team bar during NFL, but no place is perfect, lol.",

I should have left it alone then and there but being persistent I called in and ordered to go (foregoing my $7 off).  I arrived and there were only two parties seated, in a Ravens bar, on Sunday. Not what I was expecting.  I paid $46 for two sandwiches and a crab pretzel and sped home with lunch.....only to open the crab pretzel which smelled like the ocean.   The lobster roll had an ample amount of lobster, crunch bread, and an underwhelming amount of flavor (sad face), for $20!!!!   The other sandwich had a great sauce and good bread but the fried oysters, fish and shrimp themselves had no flavor at all.  My stomach wasn't happy a few hours later and neither was my wallet, but as a Steelers fan, this is what I get for going into enemy territory. I tried.",

You can also get a free crab cake by signing up for their text message group. I had gotten a pound of shrimp which was $23.99 (a little overpriced for the simplicity of the entree itself, but they were still good).

    "text": "I heard about their $1 oyster special on Sundays so came here to check it out. The oysters were decent sized and tasty. Came with the typical lemon, horse radish and cocktail sauce. They weren't the best but for $1 each... Totally worth it. For my entree, I had the crab cake sandwich. The food took a while to come out but when it finally did, I must say... I was pretty impressed. The crab cake was huge! It was a little bland but nothing a touch of ketchup and ranch can't fix. My mom got the soft shell crab sandwich. The crab on hers was huge too! She had to rip off the arms so that she could get a grip on the sandwich. We also ordered a side of French fries but they ran out so have us boardwalk fries (at no extra charge) instead. I would have preferred the regular fries because the boardwalk was too salty for me. Oh well.   The restaurant is very open. Staff... Super friendly and welcoming. The one thing that really bugged me was the fact that the waiters take the orders on their cell phones. At first, I thought our waiter was in the middle of a text message, or tweet, or what have you... While taking our appetizer order. I was a little offended and felt very uncomfortable. When she came back to take our entree order, she bent down a little and that's when I realized she was punching in our order on her phone! I get that technology is the way to go nowadays but c'mon! It was such an awkward situation. My mom thought she was being extremely rude so I had to explain to her that she was just doing her job. I hope management realizes this and changes the way they take orders because if I had not seen her screen, I would have never known!   Crab corner definitely has the potential for improvement. I'm gonna be coming here again sometime in the future and I would love to give them more stars. But for now, I'm sticking with a 3.",

You'll notice that most of the 2-star Yelp reviews are from people who don't eat blue crabs. Blue crabs are what Crab Corner does best. I understand picking crabs isn't for everyone, but this is one of those places where you have to know what to order.  I'm a fan. But it's a real time consuming meal - figure about 8-10mins per crab. Don't miss $2 crab Tuesdays (regular size) and $3 crab Thursdays (large size). I've never done the all-you-can-eat Mondays ($24.99) there, because that could be big trouble timewise and healthwise. Picking crabs is hard on your fingertips, and I usually eat 7 or 8 in one sitting. I'm not full after 7 or 8 crabs, but at that point I do feel like taking a shower after that much cracking, splatting and sucking. Feeling rich? Get the jumbo size - a lot easier to pick and a lot more meat.  The $1 happy hour oysters from 2pm-6pm are usually a large variety like Chesapeake or Fannie Mae. Very tasty and a great deal. Draft beers are $3 during happy hour.  It could literally take you 2+ hours to eat here, picking and grinning the entire time. My best suggestion is to order at most 3 crabs per person at a time, so they stay hot. When starting on your last crab, put another order in.",

It is a little difficult to get to from the 215, but it is a gorgeous place. Full bar, all of the MD/Baltimore items,  flat screen tvs, and much larger. They also seem to offer more specials- lunch, happy hour, etc.  I just ordered takeout- a crab cake sandwich and an order of Boardwalk fries. I did think that it was a little pricey ($20), but the sandwich was delicious. It would probably benefit from mayo or some kind of sauce on it, but the crab cake was full of meat, nicely seasoned, and the bread was tasty too. The fries were just fine, nothing really to write home about.   Hopefully I'll be able to return soon for a full meal here!",

The restaurant wasn't too crowded tonight but there were enough dining in on a Friday night.  We ordered the crab cake sandwich, soft shell crab sandwich, and a side of fries. (Don't sandwiches usually come with fries??) The price was a bit steep for food that wasn't impressive.   I didn't want to order any seafood that I would much rather go to hot n juicy for or boiling crab for fear that I would be disappointed. I'm sure glad we didn't. Sandwiches were mediocre at best.   The servers tonight were in their own little world. Some were working, others were socializing with the customers or on their phone.. Big turnoff!  Verdict - we won't be coming back and unfortunately if one were to crave seafood I say you're better off at boiling crab or hot n juicy.",

    "text": "Came here for the Tuesday special of $2 blue crabs. As the location is a bit far from the strip (about 15 min cab ride) the restaurant is fairly deserted around dinner time. I came for the crab but also ordered fried oysters and raw oysters. The oysters are not particularly impressive but we're fairly cheap at $1.75 each.   Now the crabs were quite delicious! I only ordered a few, but they dump the crabs onto the table and you start grabbing it for the table like a barbarian which is quite satisfying. The crabs were surprisingly hot when we got them, and quite meaty as well. The salty/cajun seasoning is really good, but I was full after 5 crabs. A great experience overall but would love to have the place be a bit more busy and lively for a better experience.",

Lots of large chunks of crab. Served with tartar sauce. Wish they had a spicy aioli or just something better than tartar. The brussel sprouts had great flavor and cooked just right. Would go back but just for the seafood and I'll make sure I double check before I leave if it's Togo.",

    "text": "This seafood shack has good food at very good prices.  I started with the lobster bisque which was rich and creamy.  My wife and I then shared the Maryland crab dip and the bacon wrapped scallops - the scallops were excellent, the dip a little less so.  My entree was the crab cake which was quite good.  They say the crab is flown in daily.  It's been a long time since I actually had a crab cake in Maryland, but I kind of remember it as being a little bit better than this.  But who knows - when you get old your memory plays tricks on you.  One negative - the crab cake came with a tiny dollop of what I assume was meant to be tartar sauce, but tasted like plain mayonnaise.  My wife really liked her lobster roll, but stopped short of calling it the best in town.  When you go to a seafood shack you don't really expect a lot of ambiance, and Crab Corner delivers on that expectation.  This shack doubles as a sports bar, with lots of TV's and Maryland sports memorabilia around - Go Terrapins!  Or something.  The crowded room was packed a little bit tight.  Service was perfectly acceptable, but not particularly memorable.  All things considered, Crab Corner delivered exactly what it intended, and at a good price.  It's not quite up there with the pricier \"Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak, and Stone Crab\" at Caesar's Palace, but when we want an affordable seafood dinner we will be back.",

Asked about the 2 pound lobster for $36.99. Since there was a menu on our table with happy hour, drink & seafood specials. Oh no the price is $54.00. But their sign says $36.00. No thanks. Saw them on Tanked so we decided to eat here. The fish tank was better then our food. We watched a crab eat a mussel. Red Lobster is better in my opinion. Luckily upon checking in my other half was given a 15 percent off coupon. So we got $8.00 off our meal. With so many food choices in Vegas I doubt we will be back.",

    "text": "I'm from Virginia, so when I found this place was sportin' Maryland Blue Crabs, I had to stop in. I was not disappointed.   The atmosphere is cool and casual with a sports bar feel to it. It's covered in Ravens, Orioles, and Terps gear. We opted for an inside seat, but we noticed that outside had cool hammocks. Bucket list item for when I come back. We got a couple of beers. They had a decent selection, and we're kinda craft beer snobs.   I ordered 5 regular and medium jimmies (male crabs). The only reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is because they serve fresh sooks (female crabs) on their all-you-can-eat special. Now, I get that a lot of people prefer the sooks, but from an ethical perspective, I just don't jive with this business practice. If you are going to offer sooks, limit it per customer please!  Enuff soap boxing! The jimmies were GREAT. Boiled perfectly with tons of Old Bay seasoning. I took my time with them. They bring out all the tools you need and cover the table, so you can get your pickin' on. Our waitress, Kimmy, was THE BEST. Super friendly, hilarious, and made great recommendations. The people here are people you'd wanna hang out with.   Can't wait to come back!",

I order the snow crab It was decently priced and was cooked right, well seasoned and came with butter and lemon. The atmosphere is family friendly and it also has a small bar and gaming area for those who would like to drink or gamble . Personally I don't drink much but, when I do I don't like a strong flavor of liquor; Sam made me a tasty alcoholic beverage that tasted similar to a wine cooler (mimosas with a splash of peach liquor. I highly recommend this place because of the service, food and atmosphere!",

The food all seemed very fresh and made to order. Everything came out piping hot. We ordered the crab dip on the soft pretzel (very good), my husband ordered a 1/2 dozen oysters (he said they were good), we ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp (very good) and I got the free crab cake (very good). Our server was very informative as he knew it was our first visit and told us about the menu and how to get the free crab cake. I love crab cakes and it was good to be able to sample for free. I will definitely order them our next visit. It had lots of crab meat and not much filler at all. Great job!",

They have Crab brought in every day so look for the specials on the big blackboard. They sell crab by the pound and the size, and sex. They have blue crab but check first.   The service is a bit rustic and so it the presentation. But they usually have a Game on, and cold beer and crabs, shrimp and all, so laid back and smash some crab.   They do have a small selection of no seafood items like chicken fingers and a chicken sandwich.   Check for their happy hour for specials",

I ordered the shrimp PO Boy sandwich. My girl ordered the BLT.  The BLT was edible. The Shrimp Po Boy was not.  I'm not a picky eater, but I was only able to take two bites of the Po Boy. It tasted like old grease. The shrimp were tasteless.  The waiter stopped by and asked how the food was. I told him horrible. He just smiled and walked away. I think he must have misheard me  LOL  Other options may be better, but you've only got one shot to make a first impression. The impression they left won't have us coming back.",

And, I should have known, because the place was almost empty on a Friday night, during Lent.  I ordered the same dish as before; cod was still bad.  It didn't end there though... I was given marinara sauce instead of cocktail sauce for my shrimp, and half of my hush puppies were straight up RAW inside.  Once again, I left disappointed, and will not be back again.  It's a shame, because we need a good fish restaurant on this side of town.  Sadly, this isn't it.  Still two stars though for their awesome potato salad (it's now really the only thing I can count on there), and so-so service.  Not good, but not horrible either.  I'm wondering if it's worth trying the original location that I fell in love with, but not sure it's worth the risk for the price.",

    "text": "So My husband and I saw this place from Yelp and went to try. First,they didn't have any female crabs today, we ordered male crab - which means it won't have any eggs or a lot of sweet meat like a female one. Okay, that's fine, so we ordered Jumbo and Large Blue male Crabs.  However, the Jumbo was smaller than the Large size.. (even large was pretty small) Since our Jumbo was so small, the waitress brought us one more bigger size of crab later (we didn't ask for, she just brought one more and we really appreciated). The service was very nice. But the crabs were pretty bad. I felt like I spent $60 dollars to eat the SHELLS...  [I guess if you go there during the happy hour, it's different story]. Anyways, we had to order a Lobster roll (sandwich) so we don't get grumpy after we eat in this place. However, they didn't have sweet potato fries... so they gave us some kind of chips which tasted like a week old... so we didn't eat that. Lobster roll was okay, but for $20 dollars, I won't ever order it again. Very salty and taste not that fresh..  Overall, the service was good, the concept of this business was okay, but food was horrible in my opinion. You could go to other cajun crab/seafood places with the same price for better quality..",

    "text": "I've come to crab corner a few times and always had a wonderful experience, today however was kind of weird. Ordered a soup and the initial one came out with a hair on it... It happens, I simply told the server and they changed it, no biggie. The lobster bisque is normally my favorite item on the menu and I can't get enough, I always order a big bowl, today it was bland and had almost no meat in it. Since I had already sent back the first soup I didn't want to complain and ate my bowl. When I wasn't satisfied I decided to order something else. The staff were very busy talking, looking at their phones, and gambling on the machines so by the time I ordered my food the rest of my party was almost done eating. The bartender even put money in the machines my friend and I were at and instructed us to play for her... It struck me as weird that they were playing the machines in their own establishment, but whatever. I think the worst was when we got our bill all together, we started pulling out our forms of payment and the bartender then decided she should split the bill after... Fine ok, wasn't a big deal. I put cash as I normally pay and my friend payed with card, she never came to give me change back, all she did was inform us that she had swapped our entrees by accident so we had payed for each-others meal... I waited and waited and never got my change. I'm normally a generous tipper... But a 60% tip????? I didn't have anything to drink... Just a soup and one entree, why was I out $40? Bartender comped my friends drinks, which was nice, but screwed me... Won't be returning anymore.",

Best I've had since living in Annapolis! And unbelievable bar selections for $3! My tummy jumped for joy when the blue crabs touched my tongue! Perfectly steamed with delicious J.o seasoning. My server Jim was courteous and freakin' hilarious , not to mention cute too!!!. The mgr- host Brian was also from maryland talked to us professionally brought out some live ones to show us and taught my newbie girls how to crack em' faster than emeril!  Wow! After din we played shuffleboard & the bartender Sam showed how to play the real way and brought us over some of the best signature drinks on and off the menu and was a complete sweetheart! Sam even tuned into the game we wanted on.... Place overall made me so happy and homesick all at once....                                                                   Now for why the 4 stars and not 5.... Went back this last sat with my girlies again and half the place was reserved for a sip and paint event :( looked like fun unless u wanted to eat... Got there at 5 and they were setting up. Our server Jim was gone ( another :(   ) Brian was moving tables came  over apologized profusely ( he was soooo sweet!) and asked the night server to get us in ASAP! Night server...... Ugh!!!! Asian guy that barely spoke to us ( wearing a shirt with transformers or something... Don't remember them being from maryland.... Wtf???) led us to some tables by bar threw down some menus and left.... Luckily Sam was there again but switching to night shift  :( ... Served us a round ( awesome drinks and perfect service again !) had another round with clay who was sooo funny and helpful but told us no blue crabs because of weather :( guy who seated us could've given a heads up??? Anyway finished the round and just left... Will of course b back for more blues just make sure u call first to see if there's crabs available and no special events... Love u anyway crab corner....

The calamari was soo over fried it was rock hard and the soup was minestrone soup with crab meat that stunk really bad as if it was old. We quickly explained that we were not happy with the food and canceled the rest of what we ordered. We were given no apologies for the food and we're given attitude instead as if we were an inconvenience to them. We then got slapped with a $22 tab for a cup of soup and calamari we didn't even eat. Will never be going back to this restaurant. The boiling crab on Decatur is much better and we regret not making the extra drive.",

After 20 minutes, which truly isn't bad on a Friday night, we got seated. Our waiter took our order quickly, we got the crab cakes, peeled shrimp and blue crab. The crab cakes were tiny, peeled shrimp was good, and the crab had very little meat for the $$$. Let's just say, we walked to Roberto's and each got 3rolled tacos to fill us up.",

It's a casual joint with TVs and a bar that opens out to the patio as well. I'm a seafood lover and was really excited to try everything. We started with 2 dozen happy hour oysters priced at $1 a piece. That was refreshing. Then we ordered bacon wrapped scallops in which you can't go wrong with that. Their crabs and clams were just \"ok\" maybe because it's not in season. The size of the seafood items were rather small. However, their crab cakes were decent. Overall, we weren't impressed with the food. Food quality price ratio is definitely not great our bill came close to $90.",

The ambiance just adds to everything.  Monday Night Football watching just found a new home.  A great hangout with games, yumminess and a fun environment!  Definitely my GO TO place in Vegas ANY DAY, ANY TIME!",

This restaurant is the only reason I am not homesick! I worked in a seafood restaurant in Maryland and came home smelling like Old bay every night. When I walked in, it smelled just like Maryland.   I eat there at least once a week and I have tried just about everything on the menu, beers on tap, and wines. It is the best Maryland style seafood I have had outside of Maryland. Not to mention, there is a fantastic atmosphere,  friendly staff, and a lot of Maryland decor. I love the corn hole outside on sunny Vegas days and half price wine and live music on Wednesdays. The MD Crab soup is perfect for allergy season and the crab cake sandwich is a must order.  Another cool experience is when the servers take your orders on IPhones from the table. Gotta love technology. I have visited both locations, and they are both worth it.",

WTF ????? Not to mention we waited 20min in an empty restaurant!!!   Let me add that I still left the young man a $2.00 tip,  only bcz they're quick to say we never tip well, but if your hospitality is rude and insulting then why should ANYONE TIP WELL?

    "text": "I don't seem to share the same feelings as all the other customers who have posted on this restaurant. My daughter and I stopped in yesterday for a quick bite to eat before heading back to work. From the minute we walked in the smell was terrible, granted we know seafood places have a tendency to smell a little funky but this place just smelled bad.  The table condiments were filthy. We were looking at what was available to use and when we picked up the large container of seasoning, it was covered with food and smears and old fingerprints from previous patrons. It looked like someone had been eating crab legs with their fingers then moved onto the seasonings over and over again. The bus boy or waiting staff obviously never wipe them down.  In the women's bathroom the wall was covered in dirt and the bathrooms had all the toilet paper spindles empty with extra TP just sitting on top of the back of the toilet. Looked like no one had serviced or emptied the waste disposal unit located in each bathroom as they were overflowing with trash.   We decided to play it safe and order the chicken fingers or chicken nuggets I think they were called, we paid approx 10 buck a piece. When they came out there were 2 in each basket with fries.  They were the pre bought frozen chicken fingers and were pretty gross.  It doeskin take much for a restaurant to purchase fresh chicken tenderloins and dredge them in some milk cover them with some flour and deep fry them.  This is a pretty simple meal to prepare for most restaurants.  Not to mention the price was way over for 2 nuggets I mean they weren't even extra big just seems a bit steep for 2 bites.    Needless to say we wont be back and would recommend that they either find a cleaning crew to clean things up or they wont be in business too long.  Also a little fresh food really goes along way.",

Don't worry they flip back and forth between both locations so you'll see them somewhere! =]  The location is pretty nice, just northwest of the I-215 on Rainbow, pretty convenient to get to and it's a lot larger than the original location that's on Flamingo and Eastern. They have booths, half booths, tables, outdoor stuff, and a bar!!   $2 Tuesdays plus happy hour? That's always a plus walking in during happy hour! You know I'm happy ;) I always enjoy getting a couple of crabs usually around four crabs plus a side, which leaves enough room to go down the street for some dessert!   For a $2 Tuesday and happy hour, it wasn't busy at all! Maybe I'll be frequenting this location a little more and see, but there's usually a wait if you get to the Flamingo/Eastern location around dinner time, but this one had zero wait time! :D",

The groupon drink of $15 for a glass of alcohol mix is quite a joke. It tastes no better than a pre-mixed Costco type of drink. The service is fair, not great but not horrible. The food is good but way too expensive as it comes to a small tiny portion. Two order of crab cakes cost almost $28 but it is just like an appetizer. If your budget is less than $40-$50 per person, this is not a place for you. It all explained why this restaurant is quite empty and not sure if it is in business for long if they still keep the cost of their food that high. This is not the Strip to charge that premium price.",

My other friend had the only 'disappointment' as they were out of the fried clams he had his heart set on but he was happy with his Crab Cake Sandwich that he settled on.

It comes frozen.  I guess I respect his honesty, but as a customer I wanted to leave right there.  I felt like I was being punked or in one of those insurance commercials.    We also waited 20 mins for a table for 5, with no one else waiting for a table, all while looking at 4 (4-person) empty tables around the front.  After 20 mins, someone finally figure out to put 2 tables together.  It took another 10 mins for the waiter to take our order plus 15 more to get the 1st drink.   Maybe they were short staffed?  For the food, it just lacked any seasoning at all.  I will say that the calamari was good.  The fish was terrible and there just isn't any crab in their crabs.   Even the \"crab tank\" that was featured on  \"Tanked\" was missing crabs!  So disappointing, as that was the reason we wanted to try this restaurant.",

I saw 3 employees during that time one which helped another person sitting down that was waiting before me.  The other two went to the podium to grab something only to walk away right after.  Another person walked in and was acknowledged immediately by a waiter.  It was only until this time the waiter said \"we will be right with you.\"    As for the food, I ordered a few female crabs and the crawfish special.  The crabs were excellent 4.5/5 as expected.  The crawfish was slightly bland but I guess that's how it is normally cooked with that style.  I asked if the crawfish were live but when I started eating it I found a few about less than a pound that had signs of being dead and old such as being mushy or black mush inside the crawfish with no meat.  Overall, the crab were delicious, crawfish was less than mediocre, but the service was abysmal.  Plus side is when you finally get to order they come out in 10 minutes or less.",

It's a very low-key restaurant no bells and whistle's just some tables and minimal decorations. It gives off a hole in the wall vibe which does not disappoint when it comes to the food. The portions are big and the seafood is seasoned to perfection. The two times we came we ate more than we could handle. The wait staff is excellent, they're just your regular laid back guys that come around every few minutes to check up on you. Looks like we've found a new local fave!",

I ordered Steamed jasmine rice, and hush puppies with my oysters fried hard. While waiting for my food, the hostess came to tell me they didn't have any rice, it was still cooking and would take a while, so I opted for the potato salad instead.  The oysters that were fried hard were amazing! The hush puppies were fried to perfection and the potato salad was good.  My only complaint at this visit was that they didn't have any rice prepared, in their defense they had just opened. And some of my oysters were soft, not fried hard.  This is still the best place for seafood and I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Worst experience ever.... I was a little weary when we showed up to see the empty place but lured by some great reviews of the Happy Hour oysters for $1 each, why not. Huge mistake. We ordered a couple other fried items that were tasteless.   The guy, Richard who took out orders and brought the food out was probably having a bad day?  When he dropped off the food, he just left and didn't check back on us until he brought the check and clear out the plates. Oh and we couldn't flag him down as he was either chatting with someone at the other end of the room or he would have his head buried in His phone at the front desk.    So when I finally had a chance to catch his attention on my way to the bathroom and he was carrying the empty plates back to the kitchen, I asked him why the oysters were so shriveled and dry, with no brine AT ALL... his response? Oh we fly it in fresh and it's not dry. I pulled up the pics I took of the horrible oysters and he then somewhat looked like he would say something to \"fix the issue\" BUT to my shock, he blurred out: \"why did you not tell me before?\" Ugh!  Really?  It's my fault that you didn't do YOUR job and served us old lame dry oysters & you still blame it on me for saying something in hope you would fix it and not get a scathing review?  Richard had a chance to remedy a bad situation. Instead he chose to blame it on the customer.   STAY AWAY and avoid this place at all cost!",

As far as the food goes, I don't understand what people love. Granted, we didn't order the famous Maryland crabs, I expected much much more from what we did order. I have never paid such a high market price for crab legs. My crab cakes were dry and flavorless. The salad we ordered was thrown together and sloppy. My kids were even meh about the chicken fingers, and I feel like that hard to mess up.   We won't be coming back.",

I used to go to 3 Tomatoes all the time on the weekends, so it was exciting to be back.  The exterior hasn't changed at all.  The interior really hasn't either, except now they have a huge tank with live blue crab, and they've painted a little...  Now, onto the food.  Ever since my last experience at Crab Corner, I've wanted to try the crab cakes.  My fella isn't big on crab cakes, but agreed to get the appetizer (4 minis) to try.    When they came out, I was concerned.  They are TINY...and really expensive.   But after one bite, let me tell you, they were 100% worth the money. There is SO MUCH CRAB MEAT IN THESE TINY BITES OF AWESOME!  This is going to be a regular item for me, I can tell.  SO delicious.   We also had the cod, and the clams with hush puppies and fries:  Everything was delicious!    Drinks were pretty decent...they had a $3 mystery shot, and $3 well whiskey....PBR was $4 at the beginning of the night, but I think it went down to $3 after karaoke started.   Service was pretty good.  The bartender seemed a little abrasive at the beginning of the night, but she warmed up to us, and ended up being pretty darned cool.    Karaoke was incredible, as usual.  The host was fun, and it was great to be singing on the patio again!  I can't wait to come back again.  Karaoke was shut down early this week, but from what I understand its supposed to be 10-2 this Friday night.",

Also, I had to send two sets of crabs back because the meat was mushy. Overall it's an okay place. Kinda expensive.

I got there for dinner and the place was empty and only had 1 family which got their food and they didn't even eat it because the oyster had a worm or something (which can be common for fresh oysters but at least pick it out before you serve it) and they paid for their drinks and left. Me and my friend tried to order some crab and they didn't have any and they said that they hadn't had any in a couple weeks. Thy also informed me that they actually primarily get their crabs from the Gulf and not the Chesapeake Bay even tho this is a Maryland based restaurant. I get that fresh crab are seasonal but don't advertise you have crab then not have any. So I ordered fried oysters, boardwalk fries (which it's dumb that it's an upcharge for) and hush puppies.  Got my fried oysters and the coating was soggy but had good flavor. The boardwalk fries were good but nothing to rave about and the hush puppies were generic hush puppies that tasted like they were the frozen ones from a food distributor and not homemade.   Overall I don't recommend this place which sucks because coming from the Chesapeake Bay Area, blue crabs with Old Bay are one of those things that remind me of home",

    "text": "I have been interested in trying Crab Corner for ages now, but finally got a chance last night to dine there with a friend.  The restaurant hasn't changed much since it was Three Tomatoes and a Mozzarella. Interior is pretty similar, but still nice. They had a band performing which was a nice touch. They weren't overly loud or distracting which we were concerned about at first.  I had really intended on ordering crab, but got derailed and instead ordered the two item combo with fried shrimp and oysters. I should have stuck to my first inclination. Although my food was ok, the fresh seafood options looked so much yummier and I stared enviously at other diner's meals. I tried a bite of my friend's crab cakes and they were delicious. I'd come back for those as well as during their happy hour for some blue crab or oysters.  Service was a little slow and we had to remind our server for refills and to bring our check, but for the most part I enjoyed our meal here and look forward to trying them again soon.",

The food is barely spiced, which is bland and boring. Got the garbage can lid filled with corn, crab, and potatoes. The last thing that really made me not want to return was that they decided to use the cooling of outside air by opening the front doors. The parking lot always smells like sewer vent gasses and that smell came right into the building. The smell made it hard to eat. Will try the other Crab Corner to see if it is any better.",

    "text": "It's been 10 days since my visit and I was going to let my bad experience go but yesterday I visited another crab corner location and it was just as bad and I couldn't let it go.  Our visit to this location was during their Tuesday special and we arrived at 5:45pm and was able to catch the tail end of their happy hour. I've come in the past with my family and we enjoyed the crab. I wanted to order about a dozen female crabs but our waiter suggested I order half now and the rest later so it wouldn't get cold. An hour later we are approached by the owner apologizing for the delay but the expediter was new and gave our crab to another table. He gave us shrimp to nibble on and another beer as we waited for our crabs. Our waiter at this time was also the bartender and he was very VERY apologetic and sincere. Over an hour later we get six crabs. I don't trust the wait so I order six more female crabs. He appologizes that they are out of the smaller size but we will get the larger size for the same price. When the crabs arrive they are all males. I ask what happened to my order of females and he again apologizes that they ran out. Well I still don't understand why they didn't say they ran out of female crabs when I ordered.   Lesson learned from my visit to both locations ...just because they are named crab corner and boast their Maryland crabs doesn't mean they have crabs to sell at their restaurants, maybe the crabs are hiding in the ocean but next time I want blue crabs I'll head over to the Asian market and cook them myself.",

The waiters take their orders from their iPhones which seem a little unprofessional. My husband requested a dozen crabs to share with my son and the waiter recommended only getting one crab per person. We waited an hour to receive our food. I ordered two appetizers and I was pleased with my food but my husband and my son were starving after finishing their one crab. We had to go get something to eat afterward.

After five minutes of our food sitting getting cold, I had to walk up to the server station and fetch them myself. No one refilled our drinks the entire time. The signature crab stew was bitter and nasty. The steamed blue crabs are a ridiculous ripoff. What little meat they contain sticks to the shell and shreds apart making it maddeningly impossible to eat.  After that lovely meal, we still had another gift certificate so we gave them another chance. This time we were looking to sample the crab cakes. After not being greeted by the hostess and having to initiate contact, we finally were seated. And there we sat, ignored, for 35 minutes before the jackass waiter approached our table. With no eye contact, the first words out of his mouth were, \"So you ready?\" We stood up and walked out.",

When we get there, the guy tells us they didn't get that many crabs that day so there are no females and no special on the crabs. I thought that was fair, but assumed the drink specials ($2 Rolling Rock or PBR) would still be in effect... unless, God forbid, the availability of beer in the city suddenly drops overnight. Ended up being charged full price for the beer though so had to deduct a star.

Called in advance to see if they took reservations and was told \"no just come in.\" Bad idea! The wait was 20mins even though they weren't busy half the restaurant was empty. Not only that, people are walking in with reservations!   Once we were seated at a table with no serving ware we waited 17 mins for someone to take our drink order. Then the waiter comes and asks \"what are we eating?\" No introduction. No specials were told. Hell to this day I don't even know his name because he failed to tell us!   Our order arrived in a timely manner although we didn't have anything to eat it with (still no serving ware) My water was now empty and I'm parched so we order the bottle of champagne. Wrong! Champagne served in wine glasses and there wasn't a chiller provided so the bottle sweats on the table and we're drinking warm champagne. Smh. For some odd reason an order of white rice came out with our meal and it didn't belong to us. It sat as we began to eat and the waiter returns with a bashful smile and says \"Uhhhh yeaaaaaa this isn't yourssss\" then proceeds to do a slow motion James Brown slide as he takes it to the correct table. Yes, he took it to the table as if it were a fresh bowl prepared for them.   It's a shame that the food is great but due to the service I'll visit a different location and tell my friends to do the same.",

    "text": "Good food. Horrible service. I travel a long way to get my favorites and most of the time they never have what I come in for. They are not even willing to offer substitutes. People spend their time and money to come and they could care less if their service isn't up to par.  We were so upset that they didn't have the menu items that we came in for, that we left, and this was the second time that we had to leave because of their inefficiency.  I don't know about others but, it is way too many places in Vegas that I can take my $30-$40 and not be worried about if they are going to have the food that is advertised on the menu.   I am from Maryland, and while I long for crabs and other seafood favorites, I refuse to patronize a business where my patronage isn't appreciated or accommodated.",

    "text": "It was such a disappointment today at this Crab Corner in Rainbow.There was 1 server in the whole place & getting help from the Bartender.First of all this restaurant should be ashamed of serving this \"regular size of a female crab\" for $4 each & when u open the tiny crab it has barely meat inside.This little tiny, unhealthy crab is not even worth $2! A bottle of Heineken is $5!!!! It's bad enough the service is horrible & pricy as hell!!!! The waiter was by himself in the whole place so he's kind a rushing me to order, to top it off he has a personality of a blank wall!!!! So I intentionally didn't leave a dollar tip & honestly I didn't even wanna pay my $110 bill for a 6 tiny crab with barely meat inside, 4 baby oysters for almost $2 each, 4 mini crab cake for $10, nasty lobster bisque for $6/CUP & 4 small sides for $3 each & 1 bottle of Heineken for f******king $5 & last but not the least 2 crab cake platter for $28 freaking dollars! SUPER  PRICY WITH UNBELIEVABLE BAD SERVICE!!! Never again will be back & I will make sure to tell every soul I know not to eat at this place ever again!",

Plentiful serving of calamari lightly breaded and complete with two sides of marinara.  The clams came in a bowl with bread service.  The sauce was garlic butter and made the clams delicious!  No need for extra dipping butter with these lil guys.  The fries were also fresh cut style and very good with the table side malt vinegar.  Table also has hot sauce and the crab seasoning.  Happy hour 2-6 daily with $3 well, draft, wine.  Great job by our server keeping the iced tea flowing as well.  Only downer was the temperature in the dining area.....frosty!",

They showed up in a timely manner after we were sat and did, at some point check on us a while after appetizers and after the meal but we had to flag them down for anything else.

My boyfriend and I ordered a soft shell crab sandwich, NOT expecting literally two little crabs fried put on some sandwich buns. I am mostly writing this review because I am really displeased with their service. Maybe it is my mistake for not saying anything but if you notice that your table has literally taken one bite out of their sandwich and hasn't ate anything else off the plate and you still make them pay full charge without even offering to swap it out for something else or maybe discount it.. that is rude. It is obvious we did not like our food, when you came to give us our check our plates were still full and denied a to go box... that should have told you something right there. Again, perhaps it was our mistake for not saying something but if I were in the food industry and I noticed the table wasn't touching their food I would gladly offer them something else or a discount for their inconvenience. It was $45 even with happy hour items. Such a disappointment. It should really be called the \"crap corner\".",

It takes time to steam crabs, it takes time to prep it, it takes time for freshly made food to be delivered to your table.

The only reason we came is because after getting back from San Diego we were on a mission to find good oysters out here. Crab corner delivered. To top it off during happy hour they are only a dollar! :D we rarely stray from our regular order which is oysters, lobster bisque, peel and eat shrimp and sometimes hush puppies. Everything is ALWAYS delicious and fresh. The only down fall is I am not a huge fan of their beer selection and one of the new bar tenders is a little wierd. Other than that no complaints. And we will always be back: D",

I ordered king crab legs and they come with a seasoning salt that was too salty to eat . I ordered a plain order and it tasted the same . Thought they were supposed to be steamed but tasted like they were boiled and the water hadn't been changed in a while. I ordered a fried oyster appetizer, and was told they couldn't do that. There was no appetizer but there was an entree on the menu. I will never eat at this place ever again. You're better off going to hot and juicy or the boiling crab instead.  I am only giving them two stars because the service was decent.",

    "text": "To be fair I am originally from Maryland so my standards for a place that claims to have Maryland style seafood might be high but it also meant I was super stoked to try this place out. We had a group on deal that was purchased for $15 for 25$ worth of food. Upon arrival we were seated by a hostess who took our drink orders. The server \"Richard\" came up to take our order with a smile but using his iphone. I was having dinner with my Mother and two children aged 7 and 4 . Since  the restaurant only has two items on their kids menu - Fried Shrimp or Chicken strips I was forced to get my 7 year old a adult entree of spice and peel  shrimp which turned out to be my favorite thing in the whole place. My Mother got a order of Boardwalk fries and the Annapolis Crab Dip (Sliced toasted baguette covered with rich cream cheese & crab meat) yes it was a appetizer but she ordered it as her entree and they brought it out FIRST which is a personal pet peeve of mine but hey at least they didn't let it get cold right?  The dip appeared to have tons of crab in it but it was majorly lacking flavor and the Baguettes were very chewy and not anything I would order again especially for the price . We were pleased it didn't have a artificial crab flavor. Since our server was no where to be found we weren't able to locate the Old Bay till the end our meal but it helped with the flavor a bit. I ordered the Pick 2 Combo Entree  which they have a decent number of options to pick from I went with Fried Oysters (My personal Fav anywhere that serves them) and Fried Clams which comes with two sides (I went with hush puppies and potato salad) for 12.99. I thought it was a pretty good deal $ wise. My Oysters were really good but my clams were way over cooked same with the hush puppies. When the host lady brought my food I didn't notice until I went to ask for Tartar sauce that my potato salad was missing and this is why my rating ended up being a 2 instead of a  3. I advised her that my potato salad must of been forgotten and that we were still waiting on the fries instead of a let me check on where those are or a sorry she said and I quote \" No Maam it just wasn't ready yet so it didn't get brought out\"  so to me that was just really rude because I have been many places and they do not prepare potato salad made to order it's essentially just a scoop which I did eventually get . She didn't bring my tartar sauce and when I finally flagged down our server \"Richard\" he did say sorry and that he would get my potato salad and check on my Moms fries. Guess what? he brought my potato salad but didn't bring my tartar sauce which was what I wanted all along so by the time I was able to eat my yummy oysters they were cold and I was already annoyed. The boardwalk fries did finally come out once we were almost done with our whole meal but Richard was kind enough to try to rectify my upset by comping us for the fries which turned out to be somewhat of a saving grace but I still wouldn't go back to this place again. The service needs improvement and for the price the food just doesn't outweigh the slow turnover and mediocre job on the items. The peel and eat shrimp really was delicious though and if you are dying for a place where you can pick your own crab and enjoy some spicy shrimp its worth checking out but I can't say I will be back.",

Everything after that was very very very subpar. We ordered the blue crabs and they were so OVERCOOKED, it seemed like someone poured a smoothie into a crab shell. But again, we wanted to see if things could get better.  We next ordered two sandwiches since we were worried to order any other hard shell crab.  The sandwhich I ordered was very subpar. There was nothing special about it and it was like they just put crab on a hamburger bun The sandwich my mom go I did not look as appetizing as mine as it looked like shrimp was mixed with mayonnaise and thrown on a hamburger bun.   Will not be back most likely.",

Started off with the $1 oysters on hour happy hour and some fries. The oysters were amaze zen! The fries were cooked to perfection and the seasoning was bombtastic! Mini crab cakes were a little piece of heaven with every bite. The crab was so fresh and tasted like no other crab I have tasted before. The gaming was great my friend won and I had a good time sitting on my machine for awhile. Once dinner rolled around I ordered the Catfish with corn and hush puppies. The cat fish was sensational! The hush puppies were the best I have ever had. The corn was so fresh and so bursting with flavor. Love the kosher Old Bay seasoning the bartender provided me with. All the beers were great and they had a great bar setup with plenty of booze to fill our needs. Cannot wait to come back here. Thank you to all staff that made this a joyous and memorable experience.   P.s. Garlic green beans were on point!",

    "text": "You know those seafood places, that smell like seafood, but not in the good way?  This seems to be one of those places from my first visit here. The first impression this place left on me was...well,  that fishy smell, not off to a good start....... Myself and a few co-workers stopped here for lunch. As it is a relatively new location that did not open too long ago. I figured they would have their best foot forward.  Sure hope that was not the case.   Cant remember the name of the server, we only saw him 3 times during the whole visit. 1) bring water and take order 2) drop off food 3) drop off check.  Now let me clarify, I do not expect to be served like a king, I am not a nose up type of person. However, when we had to ask for a re-fill on drinks from a different server that happened to be walking by, then I started to question the service.  This brings me to the food. Part of the drink re-fill debacle was due to the fact that all of the food we ordered was overly salty. We were all parched and need large amounts of water to wash down the food. The fried soft shell crab was not very impressive, scrawny little guys, 90% shell/breading, 5% meat, 5% grease/salt. The fries were not bad but they were nothing to write home about either. The potato salad was pretty good.   I will probably give this place another shot as every place has its off days. Im just hoping that this was an off day and not the standard at Crab Corner.",

We came in town for a conference and decided to bring my parents and our kids, there were 6 of us that being said two were children one 8 and the other 11.  The waiter was friendly but never anywhere to be found, when I ask for the check I noticed he added 18% to my bill, My husband and I waited tables all through high school and college so we tip between 20 and 25% always, I gave them 3 stars because first of all the service sucked we saw him all of 3 times he came back once in the hour and forty five minutes that we were there to fill our tea and water the rest of the time it was just to drop off our food he didn't even clear the dirty dishes out of the way till he brought the check.. I should be happy he saved me money because my husband would have insisted on leaving at least 20% but when he saw that he put 18% tip on for 4 adults and 2 children he agreed.. I really would say for the price of the meal and the lack of service go somewhere else there are so many other places in the Las Vegas area where you will have better service.. I wish I could say we would be back but I think we will be looking for other places to visit on our next trip.",

A Bloody Mary, a few beers and oyster shooters and it was a good time.  Anyways, the oysters on the 1/2 shell were fresh and so delicious. They are a dollar a piece during HH. We also had the boardwalk fries, calamari fries and lobster bisque. The boardwalk fries were so good. Fresh cut fries, fried in peanut oil and seasoned with bay seasoning. Yum. The calamari fries were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. And the lobster bisque was rich and creamy. Actually had little chunks of lobster in it. Thank you Ashley for showing us a good time and for being our \"bad influence\", in a good way, of course. Until next time!",

So I am sure that's why we got an extra one to try to make up for the pathetic ones. And they had the nerve to charge $10.50 for them. I've had better oysters at AYCE sushi restaurants in this town or even Tides Oyster Bar @ Sunset Station. Ordered the soft shell crab sandwich for $13.99 (I believe). It was good I have to say but I have again had better. Tarter sauce was good though. I don't know that I'd particularly go back to this place & spend my hard earned dough when I know other places that have better food. Possibly only for happy hour when items are discounted.",

They also have other weekly specials, but we mainly come for the trivia on Thursdays.  Jeremy always takes care of us and he is great! He remembers what we order and always checks in to make sure we are taken care of. I have gotten a few items on the menu and they are all tasty, but try to get their special lobster roll if they have it available. My only complaint is that I wish they had more selection on their menu.  Love this place. We will be back every Thursday!",

    "text": "We stopped here for a quick, light lunch a few weeks ago, and probably had one of the best lunches ever. We had the lobster bisque, Maryland crab soup, and the mini crab cake appetizer (You could see how good they are from the pictures if I was able to post them). Anyone from back east or who prefers the fresh, loaded with crabmeat and almost nothing else crabcakes should just love these. I can tell you we did.  And the lobster bisque I would agree with another reviewer is the best ever. Even though I had ordered the Maryland crab with vegetable soup, which was good too, the taste of the bisque kept making me want to taste more.. The whole meal was surprisingly filling, too, and made us feel pretty healthy, too. It was a pretty quiet afternoon for lunch outside on a nice sunny day, and our server was great in every way. And the cost was reasonable.",

Our server told us that they have a sale every Tuesday for $2 for each crab (was not sure of what crab it was).  So we went there again yesterday, Tuesday (9/11/18) and even confirmed ahead by calling the manager for the $2 crab which he did confirm.  We went there by 5:20pm and to our surprise, one of the managers (I think his name was Jeremy) said they are out of the $2 crabs. Would they honor the $2 crab sale all day? If they have a sale every Tuesday, why would then they be out at 5:20pm. Is this sale misleading? Or just to entice customers to come in on a Tuesday and then tell them the $2 crabs are gone? I thought this was just misleading.",

    "text": "Crab Corner is a comfortable and mellow spot to eat some crabs and other seafood at a not unreasonable price. The best times are when there is a special or Happy Hour. There is usually a good sports game on, and a good selection of beer. The crabs are pretty good, but can vary. The crab boil is fine and plentiful to share, but not spot on. It's not a problem, however. The collective experience is more of a kind of place that you return to because it is familiar and unassuming. It is fun to use a mallet to crack crabs with your chums. Don't overthink it! And don't compare it to what you get in Maryland, even if they supposedly fly the crabs in from there.",

I dare you to find a better fish and chips in Las Vegas. Fresh, not fishy at all. Batter was crisp ans delicious. Crab legs were meaty and firm, slightly sweet and dunked in butter and lemon were a delight. Boardwalk fries were fun. Love Old Bay. Brussel sprouts were the best I've had in a restaurant and the corn on the cob was so good it was promptly inhaled. Hush puppies were on the good side of fair. Paired with the seasonal Hef and some classic rock, HEEEAAAVEN.  Our server, Jesse was a standout star! Always on hand with good recommendations when asked.  *sigh* I'm so FULL!",

    "text": "I was skeptical coming here with the mixed reviews I have been reading about the bad service and the quality of food. We decided to give it a try anyway. We ordered just what they are known for...Crabs! They had the $3/large crab special. Ordered 8pcs, 2 orders of white rice, and lobster bisque.  First off, we were greeted promptly and seated right away as soon as we walked in. That was instantly a relief since those were some of the issues of patrons here. We were handed menus and order was taken about 7 minutes later by our very friendly server.   Then our order came, as soon as I opened my first crab, it was love at first sight! It was meaty, full of crab butter, and steamed just perfectly!!! That just sealed the deal for us. Our server served all of our side dishes, limes, vinegar, drinks at one time so we never had to flag him for anything. We devoured and enjoyed our crabs dipped in spicy vinegar.   This place was truly above and beyond my expectations. Everything went smoothly service and quality of food wise. Although, I cannot speak for the other items they have for their menu since we only ordered what they are popular for, and that is their crabs.  Yelp is a great source in our dining choices but it does not always determine the outcome of our dining experience. One customer might have a horrible time but it doesn't mean you will too. Sometimes people could be ordering items that are not really their specialty so you cannot really set your expectations high. I remember dining at a vietnamese restaurant that served one of the best Pho' but their Pad Thai was anything but great.  So always give a place the benefit of the doubt and stick to the highlights of their menu.  We sure glad we did because we have just discovered a hidden gem next time we crave for blue crabs at a very reasonable price!",

The other two show that he called me a racist in a private message and tried to clean it up by stating it was sent to me in error... Not only is he rude, he's a liar, too!!  Stop harassing me, John!! I have a right to leave a review of my PAID dining experience. YOU DO NOT HAVE A RIGHT TO HARASS ME!!",

My wife had the salad with crab meat, which she thought was pretty good, while I had the grilled shrimp, which were pretty good. As with every place we have been in the area, the quality and quantity does not equal the price. $60 for our dinner with no drinks, we felt was pretty high. This would have been a $40 to $45 meal most places. I would not go back.",

And it was a week night, can't imagine this chaotic, sticky, understaffed, overcooked place on a weekend. Top of the terrible list was the Alaskan king crab. For $35 a pound. Not sure how you overcook, then serve cold. ?  Crab was so overcooked it wasn't even coming out of the shell, and most of what did, didn't taste good. Shells were difficult to crack they were so overcooked the shell and the meat was like rubber. Maybe some will put up with this for cheap crab, but take the Alaskan off your menu, you are just ruining it and charging people way too much for the finished product.   They are EXTREMELY short staffed. We waited over 20 minutes for water. We finished our appetizer before we had water, let alone drinks. ?!?! We had the only 2 waitresses in the place both coming to our table. So neither knew what was going on and both were running to every table like chickens with their heads cut off.   What a mess and horrible experience. If I was from Maryland I would be ashamed. Never going back.",

I was also given a new crab sandwich that was made the way it was supposed to be made.   It was delicious. Only 4 stars because of what happened and the inconvenience it caused me. I do plan on going back and trying out other things on the menu but not right away and hopefully that will be  5 star experience. I'm sure it will be :)  Every one can have a bad day but just don't serve burnt food to the customer Lol! Everything on the menu looks delicious and honestly I can't wait to go back!

We came around 2, so just when happy hour was starting. And to my surprise it wasn't busy. In fact at one point during our meal we were the only ones in there. Not that that is a bad thing, I like the quietness. It just rarely happens. The service was simple. Take your order, deliver your food, drop off the check and good bye. Nothing too special to write home about.   Anyways, the ambiance is open and spread out, probably seemed more so since it was so slow. the menu is large with additional flip menus on the table. For happy hour we got a doze of the fresh half shell oysters for $1 each. They were delicious, served with lemon, horseradish and Marinara.   Then, for our main lunch I got the crab cake sandwich which was so delicious it was one of those melt in your mouth experiences. It had amazing flavor and just the right amount of density to keep its form and the perfect crunch with crisp lettuce and tomato. It was also served with their home made potato chips. My friend got the fried oyster Po' boy. I can tell you he enjoyed it because he devoured it quickly! But really, he said it was really good!   We will be back to try something else, and of course you can find us there around happy hour! The fresh oysters alone are worth a try here!",

    "text": "Before heading to Las Vegas on vacation, I had purchased a Groupon for $25 worth of food for two people at Crab Corner. I don't recall how much I had paid for the Groupon back then.   I waited for my friend in to arrive in Vegas (I was here for a few days before she joined me). We headed over to Crab Corner for lunch. I drove us there. I didn't have any problems parking my rental car.  This place has a casual vibe to it. It's essentially a bar with poker video slot machines.   I had a lapse on this trip. I am normally pretty good at taking photos of what I have eaten. I guess that my friend was a distraction. All I found in my photos was a single photo of the view from where I was sitting. Luckily, I do remember what we had eaten.  My friend doesn't eat pork, so going to a seafood place was perfect. We ordered crab cakes, calamari, soft shell crab, and fried mozzarella sticks.  I loved the crab cakes the best. They were a decent size and tasted yummy. The calamari was okay. It was slightly on the oily size. The soft shell crab was yummy, too. I am not a big fan of mozzarella sticks to begin with. I found them to be okay. I only had a couple of them.  I also ordered a Diet Pepsi to wash everything down. I got a refill, which was nice.  Our server was friendly and helpful. I have no complaints about service.  This place offers good seafood. It's not the best that I have ever had. However, if you are in Vegas and are craving seafood in a casual setting, come here.  (169)",

We opted to sit outside since it wasn't as hot. For starters we ordered the crab dip on toasted bread (it came with 6 pieces) and mozzarella sticks (6 pcs). Our entree consist of Steamed Garlic Sample x 2 (crab legs, small blue crab, shrimp, and corn) market price was $64.99 each which feeds about 2-3 people. Also ordered a chicken Alfredo pasta and French fries.   The taste was alright. I know I can cook it better at home but we all enjoyed eating it. Alfredo entree is typically the same on most restaurant. Crab dip was delicious btw. I could it 3 plates of it and be satisfied. French fries wasn't as fresh, hot, and crispy.   The 4 stars was base on the quickness of service, friendly staff, good waitress, and the attentiveness. Food, i would rate between 2.5 to 3 stars. Maybe I'll return back. Happy eats!",

Happy to check out a place that dub themselves as the \"only authentic Maryland style Crab House on the West Coast\" that fly in fresh seafood daily!   We arrived just in time for hour which they offer DAILY from 2-6pm. Bacon-wrapped shrimp, oysters on the 1/2 shell, calamari fries, crab pretzel... just to name a couple options. We ordered 2 orders of bacon-wrapped shrimp (comes w/ 3 per order), and $1 oysters off the happy hour and opted for the grilled shrimp ceasar and blackened mahi mahi which came in big enough portions to feed the boyfriend and I.  Service was great, there were about 3 people helping us out. Would help if we just had only one server (who introduced themselves) and 1-2 bussers just because we never knew who to ask. Although they were all willing to help us out, just got a little confusing.   Known for their signature blue crabs which I'm still kicking myself for not trying, but we will definitely be returning for those and happy hour!  Kind of tucked away, but plenty of parking. Also liked that the bar was separate from the dining area making it family friendly. :)",

From the Fresh flown in daily crabs to corn on the cob, mini crab cakes to the happy hour beers and ciders. I highly recommend the \"Gumption\" if you're not a big beer drinker. The owner and his brother are legit Maryland guys so they know their stuff. Excellent service & I'm a huge stickler with customer service so I definitely appreciate that. The place is decked out in Maryland Terps & Ravens decor and clean inside. There is also a patio perfect for this beautiful Vegas weather. While we were there they hosted a painting classso we'll have to go back for that. I  have plenty of crab loving friends so we will definitely be back soon! Next time I'm trying the lobster :) When in town or if you're a local definitely go check out this place-Two thumbs up!",

    "text": "3.5 stars for the food.  4 stars for the service and ambiance.   My husband is a Maryland native and he had been wanting to go here for a while. This is a little far from our house, but since we were in town we decided to stop in. Fortunately we stopped in right when it was happy hour so we got a couple bucks off. We got ourselves a nice assortment of food including:  Crab cake - We only got a small one and it came free for joining the text club. This was really good and we should have gotten more!  Boardwalk fries - Eh maybe my expectations were high but these are no Thresher's fries (which they're modeled after). We actually had two batches and both were not as crispy as I was hoping.   Crab soup - This was also just okay.  Kinda pricey for $5 for what you got. As it cooled it wasn't bad.   Crab Cobb salad - Salad was flavorful and I appreciated how they separated all the ingredients so I could pick and choose what I wanted. I felt the crab meat they used for the salad was sub par. Kinda wish I got grilled shrimp instead after all the crab overload.   Rockefeller Oysters - Not bad but not as big - or as cheesy - as they looked in the picture.   Female crabs - We got an order of 6 small female blue crabs and I was reminded how much work they were. I was hoping for a more flavorful crab but I think I was a little underwhelmed. Some crab meat was more dry and some was juicier so there wasn't as much of a consistency.   Oh - and they had video poker which was actually quite fun to kill some time while waiting for the food.   Overall this place was worth a visit, especially if you've lived in Maryland and want some nostalgia. We will be back but probably get more crab cakes. And maybe try another seafood to balance it out.",

    "text": "I am a super fan for the Crab Corner Southwest!  I love the indoor / outdoor bar which comes with bartenders who are friendly, personable and know how to make great cocktails.  They have New Castle and Magic Hat on draft which are 2 of my favorite draft beers right now.  I like that they have a Shuffleboard table, Corn Hole and Beer Pong which makes hanging out with my friends all the more fun.  I met the owners (2 brothers) and they are super passionate about everything Maryland and always have a great game playing on the 9 TV's so you are not going to miss anything.  (yes I am a football fan)  They also make sure to get the Freshest Seafood possible (which I love) by having LIVE blue crab flown in daily!  I asked for the secret recipe for the crab dip but there was no way I was going to get it.  :O)  Now about my favorite items on the menu.......  I am a huge foodie and love trying different food and immediately fell in love with multiple menu items.  I know blue crab is a little more work but once you get crab picking down the meat is sweet and delicious and worth the little mess that comes with it.  Below are my favorites so far............    LOVE!!  BLUE CRABS W/ THE SPICE & DRAWN BUTTER CRAB DIP (SO GOOD) MINI CRAB CAKES HEAD ON SHRIMP WITH THE SPICY SAUCE SOFT SHELL SANDWICH IS PERFECT FOR LUNCH BOARDWALK FRIES (I ASK FOR A LITTLE EXTRA CRISP & EAT THEM WITH THE MALT VINEGAR) OYSTERS ON THE HALF SHELL ARE ALWAYS FRESH CLAM STEAMERS PEI MUSSELS  ***The service will get better as I read in earlier reviews...  People its a new restaurant and new staff, they are going to have to work out the kinks so look beyond those silly reviews and come in and experience what its like to be in Maryland at a traditional crab house!",

The drinks were okay and they had a decent selection. The service was pretty good. The food was WAY too over-salted and over-spiced, to the point where you couldn't even taste the fish and were left guzzling water all night. It was highly distracting and completely unsatisfying. I have attended Trivia here a couple times, though this was my first time ordering dinner, and I can at least say trivia is a good time, even if dining isn't.",

When I walked in, my buddy said, \"Dude, what crab place doesn't have crab legs?\"  Then, I wandered over to tank of crabs which had only 3 of them.  One of the three was doing a \"headstand\", i.e. was dead.  I haven't worked in restaurants for a number of years now, but I\"m pretty sure if there was a dead fish in the tank, the manager would have ordered somebody to fish it out of tank, and out of the public's view.  I had catfish for the first time in my life.  It was really good.  The corn was really good, too!  There was some type of trivia game going on where a woman was reading questions and playing music.  It was hard to hear her, and kind of random.  Not sure I will be itching to go back any time soon.",

That's available Saturday and Sunday 10-1.  Showed up at 9:55am on Saturday and doors didn't open til 1010 (guy apologized and said they were short staffed).  Had the crab cakes, crab pretzel, and BLT.  Crab meat is decent and BLT tomato were super fresh.  The real deciding factor on 2 stars is the slow service and they seem not to really care.  HOWEVER, Once Ashley got here the drinks wouldn't stop coming and she took us out to the hammocks with misters...she should get 6-7 stars and we decided we love her.  We will go back because of Ashley and the groupon.",

We were in a group of six and the waiter got everything ordered in a timely manner and all the orders were correct. We had been planning this trip for a month and I was excited to try the Blue Crab. We learned from the waiter that they had only King Crab or Snow Crab, no Blue Crab at all. They hadn't had Blue Crab for 4 days. The menu and advertisements place a huge emphasis on Blue Crab being available for a variety of options, but to our disappointment a lot of the menu was not available to us due to the lack of Blue Crab.   We ended up ordering fish, shrimp, oysters; they were mediocre at best. I can get deep fried seafood at many other places as long as they have a fry basket. The one thing that had the potential to satisfy me were the bacon-wrapped scallops but they were not very good either. They were small under-cooked bay scallops wrapped in bland fatty bacon.   Unfortunately we will not be returning to this place and most likely will not try the location on Eastern either.",

    "text": "I was in Vegas and we rented a car so I planned breakfast and dinner off of the strip. (Mr. Mamas breafast also reviewed) Maryland blue crab! The owner flies it in live so you can order it fresh and steamed to pick. I am very familiar with Maryland crab, btw. It's at market price which is normal. They charge per crab not in dozens like at the beach. It does seem a little expensive until you figure that you are eating fresh crab in the desert. So on to the review, I had the Crab cake platter, sweet potato fries and fruit bowl. My hub had fish of some sort, corn and salad. I was consumed with the crab so I really didn't pay attention to his, sorry. The crab cakes were fantastic! Tastes like Maryland. They were prob 95 percent crab meat. Not all filler. So fresh and tasty. I ordered (2) 1/3 pound each. I couldn't finish it. I took half a cake and all of the fruit home ...where I did finish it (because I'm a winner ) So, fantastic, flavorful, fresh, and simple. They were busy but the wait wasn't bad. The staff was probably the most attentive I have ever had. The guy we had asked if we were new and talked us thru the menu. Super nice. We never had a drink go empty and they turned the tables over really fast. It felt laid back and local. Not fancy pants stuff. If you are from the east coast, love blue crab (They have other crab also), or want a filling and fresh meal in a laid back place with great staff than this gem is the place.",

While we were waiting, we g I to survey the place. First of all there's only 2 waiters, and ONLY ONE us doing his job. Next, the food is not very good. We ordered 3 pounds of the maryland blue crab, and the size was so small, it's laughable. The crab was so bad, and they lied to us. I brang my kids along, and they didn't care to inform us that they steamed it with BEER. The maryland crab soup tastes like stale corn and a disgusting combonation of spices.

What a wonderful surprise to find this hidden gem in the corner of the plaza appropriately named. We ordered a crab dip that was served on baguettes for an appetizer, phenomenal! We had to force ourselves to stop eating them so we could enjoy our main entree. I ordered the fried clams with a side of brussels sprouts and garlic green beans. The clams were incredibly tasty with a nice surprise that they were clean.. no grit or sand. The tartar sauce was on point as were the sides.  I did try a sample of the coleslaw but it wasn't quite to my liking.  My boyfriend ordered the Crabby Cobb which was a gorgeous salad filled with all of the goodies a salad should have.. they aren't skimpy by any means with anything. I ordered a Bloody Mary and it was also very good, no complaints here. We finished off our meal with a snow cone type dessert 'pina colada'... not bad! I highly recommend taking your family, friends, mate, co-worker, or just bring yourself. The prices are outstanding for what you are served, and the menu is complete... We took a long time to get it down to a few things.. They have a full steamer menu, po boys, land lover food, desserts, full bar, tons of space & for no good reason not busy. Do yourself a favor and try them immediately  Fifty 's",

This place is a cool kind of sports bar atmosphere, just a few miles from the strip. Fresh and well cooked seafood. Worth the taxi cab ride.   Food was amazing and quick! Service was excellent. Thanks Ashley for taking care of us. Your drinks cured me!",

We ordered a dozen of the happy hour special of $1/oyster, they were not only very small, but had no flavor to them at all. Since it was Tuesday, we also wanted to get the $2 crab special they are running right now, only to be told that they don't have enough crabs to fill that special. Somewhat of False advertisement. We ended up getting the normal happy hour $4 garlic crabs, and those were very meaty and I do recommend those. The crap dip pretzel $7, also on the HH specials list was pretty tasty as well.   Since we were on a seafood kick, we got a pound of the steamed black mussels. They were kind of small, but the garnish and soup was very flavorful.   I would come back for the crabs again, but probably not order the oysters or the mussels. easy parking, and clean bathrooms.",

So bar area, they put the brown paper down for the messes.  Soft shell platter outstanding (per hubby).  If you are looking for east coast crab, this is the joint. I'm not sure what else to put, if you love seafood - get your appetite here.  Make reservations just in case.",

They kept checking on us to make sure we were happy and I'm glad they have great customer service here. My friend and I ordered off the happy hour and we came here on a Tuesday so it was $2 blue crab all day as well. They have daily specials for each day of the week you go to. We ordered 2 dozens of oysters, the mini crab cake slider (it comes with homemade potato chips if you order 2 sliders), bacon wrapped shrimp, chicken wings, and 4 blue crabs. Everything was delicious. I was so happy and pleased with their oysters. It was so delicious and fresh. You can't beat $1 oysters that are fresh as the ones here at crab corner. The blue crabs was good, but I wish they had more juices in the crab but it was still good. Although it does take some work to get into the crab so if you patient and work hard to open your crab, it's worth it. Definitely recommend coming here for happy hour if you're a seafood person.",

The garlic steamer included shrimp, snow crab, blue crab, and Dungeness crab. I'm not quite sure the measurements but the steamer was 69.99. The only complaint I have is the seasoning was underwhelming. I was looking for a spicy Cajun seasoning, but maybe they have that with other steamer samples. Overall I will be coming back!",

I went to the front desk and asked the server what was taking so long, it's been 40 minutes and he said I have no idea it's up to the kitchen. I asked if I can talk to the manager and he replied I am the manager. So we put in another order of lobster, mussels and other food. Waited until 7, everything else came but the crab. So we just paid for the food and left. My boyfriend was able to talk to the actual manager. We explained everything that happened and he replied \"I don't know, come back in tomorrow\" ?   We are in the food industry as well, so we know what it's like and we tip very well. I am never coming back again. Their are plenty of other places where you can get  and good service.

I didn't really get the flavor that I wanted and the texture of a lobster bisque soup wasn't there. On the flip side though, their lobster roll is pretty good! The bread/roll was buttery and toasted on both sides which I am a huge fan of. They give you a lot of lobster in the roll. And a side of chips.   I'll definitely visit this place again (probably during happy hour since they seemed to have some good deals!). And I actually would order the lobster roll again.",

The first thing that raised my suspicion was how quickly the crabs arrived. Like within 5 minutes. If you are really steaming crabs, then it should definitely take longer than that! Which led me to believe that the crabs are steamed way ahead of time, and RESTEAMED when people order them to heat them up. Anyone that knows crabs, will know that this process ruins the crabs and makes the meat mushy. Plus they got cold in a couple of minutes. True steamed crabs stay piping hot for like 30 minutes.  That would be like having a cereal restaurant and pouring all the milk in the bowls of cereal hours ahead of time, and serving someone the cereal like 4 hours later. Seriously. If you claim to be from Maryland, you need to make them correctly, and stop False advertising. Crabs are a delicacy, and it's crucial to make them the real Maryland way. Not reheating previously steamed crabs! Did I mention that the jumbos were really the size of mediums? Needless to say, my sister and I didn't even eat all 8. After about 6 crabs, we were so disappointed we had completely lost our appetite and did split, never to return.",

    "text": "I absolutely love this place! I've ordered so many times and have yet to be disappointed. They can be quite expensive but so is any other seafood crab boil place.   In my opinion, I love hot n juicy but they are not close nor do they deliver so when I found this place, I was skeptical but omg they are amazing.   My order is always the steamer entree for 2 and I substitute the clams for extra shrimp. You get a decent amount of mussels and crab legs but don't forget the bread or jasmine rice to soak up all the flavors.   This particular steamer is 49.99 and it feeds a good 3 people. My husband just tried it today and loved it and he's picky.   He ordered onion rings and a pound of shrimp and it was devoured.   You can see based on the pic how good it was as I forgot to take a pic in the beginning but after it was all gone, it's quite apparent how great the food is!",

I'm always wary of Groupon restaurants because they tend to treat you poorly or pressure you to spend more and sure enough we felt the same way here.   Besides the usual cold demeanor and pressured upselling, the big issue I have with this place is that they LIED and told us they were completely out of crabs. I guess because we had a Groupon they rather we ordered off their happy hour menu then spend more money buying the overpriced crabs for whatever reason? I was really confused because we were here at 5pm for dinner. Was a place called the \"Crab Corner\" just gonna have no crabs for an entire dinner service?  As it got busier, it became obvious they were preparing tables for crab boils. At this point our server came over and said they \"just happened\" to get a few crabs in and tried blaming it on the weather. The situation made absolutely no sense that they went from zero crabs to suddenly having some half an hour later?  The lying aside, the food here is really just okay. I sampled a wide range of dishes (since there was \"no crabs\") including raw and cooked oysters, lobster bisque, bacon wrapped shrimp, ceviche. Nothing wowed me. There's nothing here that you can't find better somewhere else.",

The mini crab cakes were definitely packed with crab meat instead of filler.  I surely had a smile on my face.  The real prize was the Crab Dip on the pretzel.  This savory and indulgent appetizer had a garlic cream sauce in which the crab was cozied in with.  I should probably just order 2 of those next time!  I am delighted with my visit to Crab Corner.

Service was beyond 5, also our server Chilly was also ver helpful. Our bill was $212 and i thought considering the amount of food and the fact that the food is definitely flown into the desert everyday.,I would consider the price well within reason. My only complaint would be there was slightly too much bear used in cooking our platters. I'm still giving the place 5stars because it still exceeded my expectations",

Then we ordered the garlic steamer sampler. Also and amazing meal! Definitely not a meal for two, more like 3 or 4. The crab was very delicious and full of flavor! Last but not least the bottomless drinks.... a choice of Bloody Mary, Mimosa, and Sangria. I had the pleasure of trying all three and all three were on point! Seriously I dont want to under sell the quality of these drinks. All were made very well and poured with a heavy hand ;-) I will definitely be coming back to this location.",

We tried to enjoy this expensive meal: 1 order of french fries, 1 order of onion rings, 2 orders of crab, 2 beers for $85.00.   When asked how we were enjoying our meal we told them that we could barely eat it with all the salt. one server told us that he asked them to cut down on the salt the other server told us to next time order it without the seasoning and oh! you didn't know it comes that way...

Our server, Jared, was cocky with his responses to questions we had, like \"how much are the steamed crabs?\" among other things. I got the crab cake platter like I got last time and again, this thing is not worth it. The size is fine but it's the most bland crab cake I've ever eaten and I used to live in the North Virginia area where it's pretty easy to get good crab cakes. I say save your money and go somewhere else. The food and service aren't worth it here!",

    "text": "Bottom line on this recent visit: the crabs are great; the service.....not so much.   We were served by a waiter named Kyle. After he brought us our drinks, he then took our order of 8 blue crabs (Tuesday's special at $2/crab) and an order of black mussels. We waited for about 10 minutes until the crabs arrived, however there was no sign of the black mussels nor did Kyle tell us that the mussels would be coming up shortly. That's fine we thought. We figured the mussels would arrive soon. 15 minutes into our enjoyment of the crabs, we realized that our order of mussels had yet to arrive. Ok, we'll just ask Kyle about the order of mussels when he checks up on us or when he returns to refill our drinks.   Turns out that would never happen.   Not once did Kyle check up on us or refill our drinks until well afterward as we were finishing up our meal. One of the other servers (his name was David, I believe, and he appeared to be a senior member of the staff) took it upon himself to refill our drinks and ask us if we needed more crabs. If it weren't for David, we would still be waiting there to have our drinks refilled and our second order of crabs taken. Prior and after David approaching us, we would notice Kyle walk by and glance at our table several times during our meal. Not once did he ask us if the meal was to our liking nor did he refill our drinks. It seems that he didn't notice our drinks (or lack there of) or that he just couldn't be bothered to refill them. We were not about to ask to have our drinks refilled nor ask about our missing order of mussels because we as paying customers feel that we SHOULD NOT HAVE TO. The server should be looking after the customer frequently and making sure that every need is met without having to be flagged down or asked.  Only at the very end of our meal did Kyle finally approach us and ask us if we needed anything else. By that point I didn't even mention the order of mussels that we never received and just asked for refills of our water. I would only mention the missing order of mussels if they showed up on our bill (it did not, which is another issue entirely).   We've been here several times before and have usually had good service.   This was not one of those times.",

Not sure if our server was having a bad day, but he just was not friendly.   As for the food, we Really enjoyed the crab cakes. the bacon-wrapped skewers were pretty good too. The lobster sandwich/roll was a bit of a disappointment. small and not very tasty--just ok.   Overall, we might give this place another shot eventually, but this place has a lot to work on if they want to be legitimate contenders with Hot n Juicy and Boiling Crab.",

My $17.00 dollar plate consisted of one crab cake that was smaller than the palm of my hand and a scoop of potato salad which was decent along with corn on the cob. The taste was so so. The fourth person in party ordered another seafood platter which was tasteless and hush puppies that tasted stale. Again friendly staff but the $90 bill tasted more like $30.

    "text": "Them lil boogers can get pricey depending on what size and quantity you order.  The flavor is well.... Crab! All the seasoning is on the outside so if you deshell the meat and dip a bit on the outer crab, you get the J.O. Aka ol bay flavas.  Those real crab luvas out there know the sweet treasure that lies inside the main shell!!  Just like shrimp heads n crawfish noggins! Service was ok, but quick. Peel n eat shrimp was the best dish as there was more meat, the crabs are laborious lil suckas for a lil bit o meat... But it's an experience and an indulgence at that.  Overall 4 stars, it just wasn't real satisfying and no Bammmm! But  I would return if craving crab, Monday is AYCE @ $24.99, so may be a good value if you can crack alotta crabs! Typical side order fanfare, there is shuffleboard and bar if u wanna hang out.... Now I can say \"I got crabs in Vegas\"!!!",

I think they were smaller than mimi.    Second, the server was quite unprofessional and very unattentive.  I did not get a refill on my water or a check back on how things were.  Asked for the manager, we were told, \" he stepped out\".   Being new and first time customers we were very disappointed.  It would've been nice if they offered to show us how to best eat a Maryland Crab.   The meal I ordered looked like it could've been served at Long John Silvers and would've paid a whole lot less than $40.00.",

    "text": "I remember sampling this place at its original location on the Eastside about a year ago.  It has since expanded, fortunately much closer to home.  It is as good as I remember it and then some.  It went from a small local joint to a hub for sports, great food and Maryland patronage.  One of the head honcho's, I believe named Jay, was still on the front lines getting down.  During our first meeting, he was kind enough to offer us deals on flying in bulk crawfish in from the south since we mentioned that we often threw crab and crawfish boil parties.  In fact, all staff are very welcoming and good peoples.  Not too mention, it's good to see some Pinoys competing in the industry that I have learned to be cornered by some old timers and my Viet homies, especially in Cali (ie. Boiling Crab, etc.)  The menu has expanded as well.  Aside from the typical grinds from hush puppies, fish/chips, oysters and crab cakes, I noticed lots more added such as (real) crab dip and bacon wrapped scallops.    But the fact remains, this place is built on cornering the niche that no one else has in the valley, blue crab!  Not just any old blue crab, Maryland style baby!  Although some compassion about the work expended when eating crawfish and blue crab, it's all about the entire experience, not too mention, these crabs are streamed just above rare, I can just imagine Katsumoto uttering...perrrfecct #lastsamurai.  Topped with that Maryland spice and throw in the Filipino vinegar, and you got yourself a feast line no other.  The trick is to get the large or jumbo female blue crab, that way when you pop em open, all the savory goodness can be enjoyed with a bowl of white steamed rice, gotta get yo starches in complete the meal.  Booyahh!   BTW, my wife says the (real) crab cakes here is one of the best she ever had [Drake voice].  Oh, and I almost forgot to mention, happy hour starts at 2:00 p.m. and ruins until 6:00 p.m.  what a way to put a cherry on the crab cake.  I gotta go with the drafts for $3 a pop and the Crabby Mary is definitely a treat.  Just know, this place is ran by Terps, yet no turtles are served in the menu.  So if you root for the Ravens, the Terapins or anything else Marlylandish, roll through and be ready to get crackin'.",

My wife and I visit here often, and the servers are always friendly and attentive. They seem to remember us and try to sit us at the same table every time, which is a nice personal touch. The prices are reasonable, the food is usually fresh, there is almost never a wait to get a table, and the atmosphere is generally very relaxed.  I do have some minor complaints. Sometimes they run out of blue crab. Occasionally they overcook the fried food (like the hushpuppies), although the food is still good. The place can get a little noisy if there is a football game on TV. Occasionally they serve us crabs that taste like they have been dead too long.  This is one of the best crab restaurants in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "This review is not meant to pan Crab Corner, but help it a bit. The food is good for the Eastern Ave. location that is more reminiscent of Eastern Ave. in Essex, but with the new location that is a bit more like Cockeysville or Reisterstown. A better location with hopefully better food. This review is also the culmination of about 10 visits over a few months.   First of all the crabs are good. It's great to have a bit of home in Vegas but your staple can't carry the entire business. Let's look at some of the other food. The crab dip is horrendous in style and presentation. It's small French bread slices with the crab dip on the toasted bread. It needs to be a hot creamy bowl that the warm French bread is dipped into presented on a seperate basket on the side...that's how it's been every time I've ordered it in Bal'mer. Every time I order it I feel a bit cheated.   I don't always have time to order the crabs and when taking a client there for lunch have to order off the limited menu. I end up with the shrimp salad sandwich because it's quick and easy. However, every time I order it's described as 'large spiced shrimp' and I always get it and feel cheated yet again. They are quite small and not up to normal Baltimore restaurant size (or at least what I'm use to from Little Lou's). They could be a bit bigger and offer a choice of buns like a roll since small shrimp are hard to eat on a sandwich roll in an earth-like gravity.   The steamer sampler is good, however the crabs are female (I NEVER eat females as they decrease the population) and feel it should be mentioned on the menu before ordering. I would like to see a choice of sauces like Bertha's. You can be Bal'mer style without directly copying.   OK, with the menu choices are kinda lax. I would like to see burgers and local favorites like crab burger or hot & Bleu burger.  I know you can't get Boh, but would like to see more local Beers like Dogfish Head IPA. It's a crab staple in MD and readily available here.   I hope to see Crab Corner improve as it grows.",

I hadn't seen it before and because I'm such a foodie I just had to try it being that I LOVE seafood! I suggested this place to a friend and she was down to try it out with me! When we walked in we were greeted by a nice guy and was told that because it was Wednesday they were running some sort of \"flip a coin night\" which consist of them flipping a quarter at 10PM and they total out your tab for whatever you've ordered up to this point.. Then if you win you get your whole bill take. Care of.. I thought to myself this is interesting.. We ordered the 8 small crab cakes for $19.99 I believe and I selected off the \"Pick Two\" menu choosing the Atlantic Cod and what we're suppose to be catfish nuggets but came out as a fillet.. No big deal I guess.. You also get two sides with that option and I preferred the corn on the cob followed by the sweet potato fries.. If I could rate my whole meal experience on a scale from 1-10 Id give them a 7.. There was nothing spectacular about my meal in fact I felt like I could've got the same quality out of the VanKemp boxed fish out the frozen food isle at the grocery store. My friend said her crab cakes were just okay as well. Being this place is new Id give it another shot and this time get some CRAB, which is what they specialize in..",

I don't recommend this seafood restaurant at all!!! Food tasted dirty still and salad was not that great. Potato salad was way to salty. Sweet potatoes were ok but needed some type of dip to give more flavor. My son has eaten seafood before but this day he ate the blue crab  male that they only had had available and he had an allergic reactions. I asked the server if they had anything for it and her remark was he looked fine. They didn't carry anything.

If you are looking for Long John Silvers type of menu and pricing this is NOT it.  If you want high quality crabs, shrimp, oysters, etc. at a reasonable price served with a smile - I highly reccomend trying it out.  This is a Maryland style Seafood House.  The restaurant is clean and well kept.  There is a large bar that opens to the inside of restaurant as well as to the open patio.  This is NOT designed to be a place for quiet, romantic dinners.  It has an open atmosphere with plenty of TV's, a shuffleboard table, outside corn hole games, and music playing.  If you are from Maryland area it is similar to a Harris Crab House, Seaside, or Mikes on the South River.  It's important to know that crabs, shrimp, even lobster require you to get your hands a little messy.  The shellfish protect their bounty, but it's worth a little work to enjoy their reward.  It's a good idea to call ahead of time to check on availability.  Fresh seafood depends on suppliers and those suppliers depend on weather in order to do their work, so the entire menu is not always available.....just like restaurants in Maryland.",

    "text": "I visited the Crab Corner last weekend with a large group in the early afternoon. It took maybe about 10 minutes for the gentleman to get tables set up for us but overall the service was courteous. The only complaint that I have is that it seemed like they were a little understaffed, which increased the time it took for us to get our food and drinks.   As for the food, it was pretty good. I ordered a two entree combo (catfish and battered shrimp with fries). Everything tasted great and was not over-battered or greasy like other fried fish places.  I would come back to this place again the next time I'm in Vegas, but maybe later in the evening when there are more employees working.",

Coleslaw needed more dressing but it wasn't terrible. B/F had steamed combo of mussels, shrimp, crab, etc. Crab seemed it was all shell so didn't even waste time eating it. Portion size was good but just lacked flavor. I would give service higher stars than the food. I can't really expect too much on the food side though as it is Vegas and miles away from the freshness of coastal seafood.",

We walk over to the bar to find all kinds of people standing in front and there was not an open chair. It turned out that all the people at the bar were already cashed out and they had tables reserved but were not moving on... when we asked the bar tender what the holdup was, he said they maybe waiting for others. I asked if they could wait at their reserved table, some of them heard me and were making snide comments and I did give it back. The skinny red headed manager came over and said we were being rude, I told him he needed to learn managing 101 and he then asked us to leave after I said a few choice words. I guess if your not a large party you need not go to the Crabby Corner... any way \"Off the Hook\" on Buffalo is cheaper and they give better value for the money.",

I'm a newbie to Maryland style seafood so I had to ask Sam how to eat the Maryland Blue Crab. Even though it was my first one I could tell it was fresh and of good quality. Sam suggested the $1 happy hour oysters. I'm glad he did because they were delicious. Fresh and buttery. Their crab cakes are some of the best I've had. They're mostly crab meat. Hardly any breading. Lightly broiled and delicious.  This place is definitely worth a try. If your looking to watch a game the bar area has plenty of flat screens and good sound. You can either belly up to the bar, or sit at a table and watch a game. The bar is half inside and half outside on the patio. When the weather warms up the patio bar seating will be a great spot to eat, drink, and watch a game.",

If you have been serviced at the Flamingo/Eastern location... then you know what to expect in regards to service since half the staff works at this location too. They have flat screens to watch your favorite sports... and they have a very nice outdoor seating area set up too.   As for food, just as good as the original!

    "text": "Have heard a lot of good things about this place and noticed this location on our way out of town. We decided we would stop here on our way back in last night, which we did. We figured it would have been a nice unwind. Enjoy some delicious sea food, have a cold beer and try out someplace new.  When we arrived they had a live band inside and the music was way to loud, I requested a table as far away as possible because I did not want that to ruin the evening. Even being in the back of the place I could hardly have a conversation without speaking much to loud just to communicate. It was rather annoying. The band was decent but no reason for that type of volume in such a small place.  Our server was very nice, respectful and answered all of our questions without issue, I believe his name was Jim. We ordered black muscles, crab legs, cream of crab soup, lobster bisque, and crab cakes. It was all ok, but nothing special or even close to raving about, which confuses me about all these previous reviews. I am assuming they have been limited on their seafood intake as far as quality, or we just had the unfortunate night of a new cook. I would call this place a mini Joes Crab shack.  The person I ate with ended up not feeling good around the time we left. We all shared the same thing except the lobster bisque, she spent the remainder of her night with food poisoning and all the lovely symptoms it comes with as we got home.  We tried it, wont be back.",

Ashley was so amazing that between giving outstanding service, she actually changed light bulbs and handled whatever else was need to ensure we and other clients could relax and chill.  Always a great time and upbeat positive energy.  Ashley always makes us feel at home.  We eat and drink way past our bedtime on many occasions....

The blue crab, their speciality is a great treat.  And, my favorite, the oysters were so good.   But the best of restaurant was the service. The two staff acted like a team both waiting and checking on customers constantly.  They provided detailed information on the menu items and even taught me the right way to open a blue crab.  And their kindness and SMILES made me feel so welcome.",

Giving three stars only because food was good, but not exciting, meaning you can probably go to other restaurants and find it much better. It wasn't horrible by any means, and probably would go back because we live close.    Service was fine, fun servers and friendly. Overall a good and decent neighborhood restaurant.",

The calamari came out hot and crispy. It was delicious! I ordered the crab cake sandwich. OMG the crab cake was so perfect. Great taste, tender, warm, flaky crab. It was very good. I ordered brussel sprouts as a side and they were good too. My boyfriend ordered the soft shell crab platter with potato salad. He enjoyed it very much. The oysters were only $1.75 each and a nice before meal treat. We also ordered a cocktail with cranberry juice and Oakhurst rum only $3. The prices here are not outrages but very reasonable.   The service here was great. We were asked if we needed anything throughout our visit here. They have a full bar and outside patio. I will definitely recommend this place and I would return. This place also offers non seafood items for anyone in your party that's doesn't eat seafood. They also have some great salads on the menu.",

Our friends ordered the steamed clams, whoa, salty, too much, could not dip the bread in the juice.  I ordered steamed mussels, they were so small you could miss eating one, and the liquid was too too salty. no dipping of the bread.  The crab legs were good and the wine was very good.  I do not know if we would go back or not.  The waiter was very good, but did not care about the salty clams or mussels.  Claimed it was the clams and mussels that were salty.",

The guy that worked there, told me that on Thursdays it was $3 for a large Maryland blue crab. I couldn't pass up that deal. You need to get here early. Once they sell out of the crabs, that's it. You're either going to have to order another size or wait for another day. Sometimes, they don't get the crabs in, so the guy told me to call first.   Their crabs are flown in fresh. It was so fresh, sweet, and yummy. On Tuesday, I ordered four. On Thursday, I ordered three. They were broiled with Old Bay seasoning sprinkled on the shell. They were all delicious. I also had the crab cakes. They're the best crab cakes ever. Every bite of the crab cake had chunks of meat and very little filling. It was seasoned to bring out the freshness of the crab. I also ordered the sweet potato fries. It was a huge portion and fried perfectly.  My husband doesn't like seafood so he ordered the grilled cheese sandwich that came with chips. He said the sandwich was good and stuffed with cheese. He didn't finish the chips. It might have needed more salt or seasoning. He also got the mozzarella sticks for his appetizer and polished those off. They were really good with the marinara dip.  The guys working there were really friendly. We talked story and about football. We needed directions to Trader Joe's and they were more than happy to help. One of the guys even helped me with my fantasy football pick.  I told the guy that they needed to open up a spot on Oahu. He smiled and said that the prices weren't going to be the same, shipping charges to Hawaii are horrendous. It's the story of my life. If I lived in Vegas, I would be here every Tuesday and Thursday. I want to fly back just for this. It was the best meal that I had in Vegas.",

I could've eaten like 10 crabs but I didn't because of the cholesterol.  Our waiter was so nice and was very attentive.

I definitely prefer this location to the Eastern location because the area around the restaurant is better and the dining area is more spacious.   Our preferred starter is the mini crab cakes. I definitely can't complain about lack of crab here. These crab cakes are almost all crab and have very little filling. The crab here is reasonably priced and very fresh. It's also prepared perfectly so it's easy to crack the crab and get to the meat in no time. The sweet hushpuppies side is generously portioned and delicious. The flavor is great and they have a nice amount of sweetness.   The restaurant is very sports oriented so I would suggest avoiding this place on a Saturday or Sunday during football season. It says a lot about their crab if I can sit through sports to eat my crab.",

My wife had a crab salad, which she seemed to enjoy.  My child had the chicken tenders meal, which were just a couple of very fried chicken pieces and some orange slices; I was not impressed by the kids meal.  The service was decent, but it was a slow night.  Overall, the food was a little pricey for the quality, so my family won't be going back.  I am kicking myself for not checking Yelp first, which I normally do.  Ultimately, for my future fish sandwich cravings, I will be sticking with other well known restaurant options such as Miller's Ale House or Yard House, which are similarly priced, but higher quality.",

It may take us a while to get there from Centennial Hills bu we think it's so worth the trip because the Seafood is so Fresh & Delicious that the ride does not matter because of what you get there for a dinner. We started out woth a Seafood Gumbo that was to die for. All kinds of Seafood and some great shrimp to boot. Then we had the Crab Cakes with 2 sides and we chose the Potato Salad & Cole Slaw that were both scrumptious to devour. If your in the area do yourself a favor and stop by Crab Corner to eat. From a fish sangwich to Lobster you will Love it. And, you can call in for fresh Lobster every day and take it out Live or they will cook it for you at a Great Price. You can't go wrong here & Jeremy was our server and he is Tops Too.",

At least that's how I'd imagine what happened. The crab itself was very salty though.  Prices: I expect for seafoods to be slightly expensive but I'd willingly pay that price if the food tastes weren't disappointing!  Happy ending: it was my birthday. They gave me free dessert!",

I mean really really good!!! It came seasoned with their special seasoning a side of lemon and butter!!! It was delicious... the dessert came out..

    "text": "I really believe that the positive reviews are from friends and family members. I am so disappointed in crab corner. I have been coming here since the place first opened to eat Maryland  blue crab. I'm originally from Maryland and I consider myself a professional crab eater. In other words ....I love crabs, I eat them all year around, I can crack them with my hands no utensils needed and I can eat dozens by myself.  Here are the reasons why I will never EVER never go back. ....1. The guy /cashier is soooo  soooo  soooooo rude and unprofessional. 2. The guy attempted to pick  an argument with me before the crabs were even sold. 3. The guy knew the crabs were bad when he sold them but chose to sale them anyway...integrity. 4. He tried to lie about the crabs being from Maryland. . . The crabs are from Texas. Texas?? Why advertise Maryland blue crab when they arent.  5. The meat in the crabs were mushy and he had to crack one just to see for himself. As if I was lying 6. Crabs should not be full of water..they know that but  they sell them to people anyway.   7. I ordered a dozen medium male and 2 reg females. The guy acted like he forgot I ordered to female crabs. When I turned all of them over and showed him all males he acted like he was shocked .. he didn't realize he was messing with a pro . 8. The guy tried to make me pay for the crabs even though he knew they weren't any good. 9. Because i wasnt in the mood to argue...We agreed that I would pay for 3 and my friend would pay for 3...although  ....   we ate NONE. Each one we cracked was full of water and one look or feel of the very little (light weight)...real crab eaters know what I mean when I say light weight) meat ..u can tell the meat was mushy.. 10. Even after we paid for the food we didn't eat the guy tried once again to pick an argument by making condescending statements. Once again I will NEVER ever NEVER GO BACK!!! OH they get 1 star for French fries.. my friend said they were great. DO NOT BUY TEXAS..lol CRABS from this place.",

Then later a 2nd server came named Richard took our order. They were actually SOLD OUT on majority of their items we wanted. So whatevers, we still thought we should give it a try. Got our food which was such a small portion amount for their price. Not worth it! Even their oysters were very tiny! On top of that, Service was horrible! No one came to check on our table to see how we were doing the entire time we were there. They were 3 other tables there. But they weren't busy at all! The bill came out & realized the snow crab special w/ 2 sides was NOT $19! We complained, and told Richard the other guy who 1st came quoted us $19. Richard himself, who we then found out was the MANAGER said well he quoted you wrong, I'm the manager! I'll go talk to him. Instead of saying I apologize for his mistake, and adjusting the bill. He just left it as that! No apology for the mistake absolutely NOTHING! Not even a thank you, have a good night! Take your money else where and eat at a seafood buffet, or hot & juicy or even boiling crab! Never again!",

    "text": "I came to this place when it was still really new and was not thrilled with the food or service at the time, but decided to give it another go tonight (August 4th 2018, over four years later from my original review) and I'm so glad I did. Everything was great, the staff was friendly and attentive, all of our food was super good, and everything came out quickly.  My husband and I ordered the Bavarian pretzel with crab dip a few of their char-grilled oysters to share, and he got a pound of Dungeness crab legs and a whole female blue crab, and I got half a pound of shrimp. SO GOOD! My shrimp was really well seasoned and he let me try his crab, both were excellent. The oysters were yummy as well, they are served with melted butter and cheese which makes them extra good, wish we'd ordered more of them. We also got their skillet sundae on top of a candied waffle for dessert, that was also absolutely delicious. Great way to end a savory meal. The only reason I removed a star is because the skillet was SUPER hot and I burnt my hand on the handle. The waitress did warn us ahead of time that the skillet was extremely hot (and the bubbling chocolate sauce on the bottom was a good indicator that it's hot), but when you and the person across from you are both trying to cut into a waffle with a spoon and it keeps moving the skillet around, your first instinct is to grab the handle to hold the skillet in place. Whoops! I recommend getting little cozies to put on the handles to keep patrons from burning their hands. Other than that though, both my husband and I are very happy with our experience and will definitely be back.",

I would like to do an afternoon bender at the bar for a football game and see how many oysters and Jameson's I can handle. people were very attentive and friendly, you can tell they are not full of themselves and want to make sure that if customer doesn't come back its not because of bad service. I really struggled with giving them 5 stars over 4 but I want them to stay hungry to find a way to keep their quality up where it is and not raise their price or maybe lower it a little. also, portions could be bigger...cod is an entry level price fish and is abundant. bigger pieces please. for myself and my wife it was $45 with tip and no alcohol and no crabs. will take a little financial planning to get here couple times a month like i would like and that is a sad thing.",

    "text": "Stepping inside of the Crab Corner immediately made me reminisce of the former failed Italian eatery once in its place. The memories were easily found with the same set-up, even with alignment remaining the same. This should have been more than a hint, but of course we proceeded to order.  The menu was basic, but much listed as 'market' price. With the bill, the market rates seemed to be more from a greedy Wall Street banker lining their pockets on seafood futures, than from a local crab shack worth spending a dime.  The food was not bad, but very in-proportionate and served on China from a local dollar store. The table was crowded with customary sauces and shakes of seasonings, but oddly served in a Pepsi bucket as if a local sports bar.  The service was poor at best. Perhaps suited for a group of college kids out for a binge, but not to par with expectations for such high prices and very subpar presentation.   In closing I would not make this a personal recommendation, but then again know that for the same price there are wide selections of superior rated and highly frequented competitors not far off the beaten path.",

There was 6 of us so we ordered some apps, calamari, bacon wrapped scallops and oysters. By far the bacon wrapped scallops were the best and accompanied by an amazing sauce (not sure what it is but its absolutely delicious).  I ordered the peel and eat spiced shrimp and other than being fairly large sized shrimp nothing else really stood out about them. We also tried the crab cake sandwich which was a decent sized cake on a bun. The crab cake was very tasty. My son ordered the popcorn shrimp and I'm assuming he liked it because he ate it all up.   The service was great. Everyone from the minute we walked in were very pleasent and attentive. It would be a good, chill place to watch sports games and enjoy some seafood.",

    "text": "Let me start off by talking about the whole \"the server was on his phone the whole time he was taking our order!\" comment in one of the reviews a women left.   If you didn't already know, their cell phones have an operating program that's connected to their computers & printers; therefore, instead of writing it down they use their phones & once they hit send it goes straight to the kitchen's printer. Not quite sure if this technique is really professional or even more efficient than the old fashion way, but I guess that's just how they do things here & I have no problem with that.  Let's move on, the food I absolutely love! I am a seafood fanatic & this place is one of my favorite places to go. They give you good portions especially for their snow crab legs. The only problem I have is that they charge an outrageous amount for a half a pound of shrimp. I think it was either $8.99 or $9.99. Personally I can go somewhere else for cheaper shrimp that tastes the same, but I still sometimes come here anyway.  Apparently the service is hit or miss, but I never have bad service when I go there. But they are right about one thing, water refills..",

Bit annoying but meh, stuff happens. Then they get our order wrong and one dish didn't arrive until right near the end of the meal and only after we reminded the waiter repeatedly. Oh and another entree never arrived. That was moderately annoying but oh well. If the food was good this could be brushed aside. But it wasn't. The food was a big mound of mediocre. The crab was all shell and fairly tasteless. To top it all off the service was slow. So let's recap. Poorly stocked bar. Sucky service. Marginal food. Slow.   One pro. The mussels were nice.",

We decided to try the crabcake sandwich and the shrimp Po boy. Beer was served in a bottle and I had to ask for a glass. The waiter suggested Brussel sprouts as a side. The food came at a decent time however as the food was starting to come out the server said that they ran out of coleslaw for the Po boy and asked whether I wanted to exchange for something else. I was very hungry and did not want to wait so I just asked if we could get the Brussels sprouts free instead and she agreed. My boyfriends crabcake sandwich was a huge portion and not skimping on the crab meat. It was delicious. My Po boy was fair considering I did not have coleslaw to go on top of it. The chips that were served with the meals were very greasy and tasteless. The brussels sprouts were deep fried and very greasy. I would preferred them roasted. All in all it was decent but I would definitely not pay $15-$20 a meal for the atmosphere. The service was decent as well.",

They were very good, almost no filler and all crab so I wasn't too upset about the size.     For dinner we shared the Steamer Sampler with includes one pound of peel and eat shrimp, one pound of Dungeness crab, one pound of Snow crab, three whole blue crabs and two ears of corn. For the price (market) it was a pretty good deal. It was more than enough food for two people.    I would go back here again to try their other menu items, but wouldn't get the sampler again.

Fresh horseradish and cocktail sauce and lemon, perfect.  Met the owner, one of the owners, Mark. My server was a really great guy named Kyle. I'll definitely be back, it was like being in New Orleans. Love love love this place.",

It was amazing and I can't wait to eat more when we go back! The pretzel was pretty good and did the trick to satisfy the craving. The crabcake sliders were pretty sad but I imagine it was since it was happy hour. The snowball wasn't shaved well enough. But guys.. THE CRAB! It was so worth it. If you're coming to the crab corner get the steamed MALE crab and you'll be happy! And I will add that the place was clean and service was reasonably fast.",

My husband and I had to ask for every single thing. The food is not the best, it taste like uncleaned seafood and the lowest quality. They are extremely expensive and one thing for sure I will never return. If this is what Maryland's  seafood taste like I will make sure to pass during my vacation. Red lobster gets a 10 over this place. Eat at your own risk!",

First when we come in we don't get greeted so it was a bad vibe immediately walking in, the manager just puts his finger up and tells us to wait to be seated by a server. SO when we received our food my boyfriend didn't want his fried shrimp he ordered and DIDN'T eat it he also went to pay for the rest of the bill and asked the manager if he can take off the shrimp since he didn't eat it the manager called my boyfriend a \"bitch\" and \"asshole\" because he sent it back so this manager needs to be changed asap especially if you want better reviews (white older man tall with glasses) the customer service is a 0/10, I come from the restaurant business and this is not how you treat your customers I don't know who that man thought he was but his attitude was disgusting. Never coming here again and I recommended everyone on my social media don't come here",

We visited the week before Valentine's day and they had the special menu for 2. Our special menu for 2 choices were the appetizer trio which came with crab cake, bacon wrapped scallops, & bread with crab dip and for our entree we got the lobster and snow crab legs. The entree came with choices of 2 sides, we got 2 rice, garlic beans, and cole slaw. A bottle of red wine and for dessert we got the caramel cheesecake with ice cream. My other half and I enjoyed our meal. Everything was delicious and by the time we got to dessert we were so stuffed that we only finished the ice cream and I had to take the cheesecake with me to the hotel. I am not sure if  the special menu is just for Valentine's day but this is a great deal. Reading the latest Yelp reviews, I am not sure what happened, but we had a great experience. I can't wait to be back again @ Crab Corner.",

I would go back, but next time it's crab legs!",

    "text": "This Vegas weather is too good to miss out on. So instead of staying home for dinner, I asked my husband if we could go out. He said sure, but where?  So after a little bit of scrolling through my Yelp Bookmarks, we settled for Venezuelan. So driving down Rainbow from Warm Springs, I opened my big mouth and said, \"oh, Crab Corner is right there!\"  To which my husband said, \"oh, I could use a crab pot!\" and makes a U-turn.  We got there right before the \"dinner rush\". We sat down ordered water and a Pepsi and started looking over the menu when my husband realized, it wasn't the Creole crab pot style restaurant. Hence the Maryland Crab signs all over the restaurant. Although a little bummed, we were already seated and so we decided to give it a try and I'm glad we did.  #1, thing we loved about this place, the 80s music. It really brought us back in time. #2, the lobster bisque was amazing #3, the soft shell crab was pretty good #4, super large portion of pasta under the large grilled salmon. So much so, that I don't think I ate half of it.  The service was great, but a little slow.  As we watched dishes come out from the kitchen, because we were seated right outside of it, my husband noticed that some platters coming out only had rows of crabs.  As we got our check, my husband asked the waitress what that was about since he didn't see it on the menu. The waitress pointed out to the chalkboard behind me where it had a list of crab sizes and prices for female versus male crabs. She explained to us that those tables had only ordered the crabs. The least expensive was $4 for the small female crab while the most expensive was the jumbo size male at $12. Per the waitress, the jumbo male size measures 7-inches. The price for crab of the size crab is reasonably priced.  Note: If you're accustomed to having just crab legs, the measurement is referring to the body of the crab and not the legs. I've had dinner with girlfriends where they've never had shellfish in its natural shell and was surprised when it came out.  Looking forward to our next visit.",

I must say that it did take 12 minutes for someone to address me at the table after i was seated and that was the hostess who came to take my drink order. Bless her heart she was trying to help, however she was underage and could not bring me my beer order. The person who did bring the beer dropped it at the table and didn't say one word. The first thing on my mind was ordering at least three to six crabs; thinking that they will look like the picture. They should call it the $2 mini crabs which would be better. It's $2 more for the larger crabs which by 4pm they had run out of. I did enjoy the fried oyster slider. On this you get lettuce tomato, one nicely fried oyster on a bun, which by the way the bun was toasted yet stale. I also tried the bacon wrapped shrimp. That to me was the best thing on the appetizer menu. You get three bacon wrapped shrimp for $6.",

The crab pretzel topping was tasty, but the pretzel was rock hard, couldn't eat it.  Lobster bisque, a little thinner than I like but nice taste.  Out of only 2 crabs ordered (just to see how close to home they were) one was ok and the other was mush, inedible (they didn't charge me for it).  Maybe it would have been better if we ordered a dozen, maybe steaming 1 or 2 causes that, don't know. I think ot was the owner we talked to and he was super nice.  Staff friendly and service good.",

She was standing there chatting with him, making him drinks, eating food & going out for cigarettes with him & completely ignoring her tables..... which sucks because there were only like 5 parties of people in the entire restaurant anyway.

Crab Corner is chock full of Terps and Ravens memorabilia plus a pretty awesome crab tank in the middle of the place. Surprised there was no Redskins stuff but then again that team is terrible. overall the place is really large which would be good if I had a party. I did not so I sat at the bar.  The server was attentive and since it was a work trip I decided to splurge with a little of everything. First up raw oysters. While not for everyone I am a big fan and these did not disappoint. The shell is pretty deep so it was like a bowl of oyster. Next up was the bacon wrapped scallops. They were super hot so it needed a good cut in the middle and some the apricot sauce it comes with. It's bacon and scallops so you know it's amazing.  For my meal I ordered a five large crabs. Tons of meat with a good spice on top of it. Not old bay but something similar. By time I was pretty full but enjoyed the meal. I will definitely be back again the next time in Vegas and hopefully with a group.",

Shaking my head on how bad the customer service and food were.....We were driving by this shack and my husband said, \"hey I'm starving, let's get some food...how about that place? I said, well the last time we were there(2 yrs ago) we looked at their menu and walked out, but why the heck not, let's give it another shot. I ordered food to go since my baby was still sleeping in the car and we didn't wanna wake her up. Few minutes later she woke up so my husband decided that we should it at the restaurant instead. so I asked the host, she said I'll ask the manager. The host was nice and friendly that's why I gave this place 2 stars.  So my husband left to go to the bathroom. I sat down and waited. Then I overheard this lady saying to the host \"to go is to go\" she wasn't happy about it she acted like a b*tch! She finally came up to me and so I said we can't even even seat down and eat here instead? Then she said it again...well did u order it to go? I said yep, then she said ......to go is go and I said yeah but we are starving and we want to eat here.  She looked at me for a second and said okayyyy in an annoyed voice and expression, she turned around and talked to the cook she got our food on the table. Food was ok, the best thing about it was the green beans. The blue crab hard shell 11.99/lb was not good there was nothing in it and it's small, it looks like a skeleton, good thing I'm on a diet so I didn't care on eating it much!!!! It was sauteed with lots of butter. My husband had fish and chips, there were no chips but it comes with 2 sides. Fish was ok we had better. We had to ask for water few minutes later and we had to help ourselves with some to go boxes. No one came to see how we were doing or if we needed anything. Bad customer service. You know the saying goes...you get what you paid for...LoL....I tip the front 10% for to go order and I was going to tip 20% for dining but since it was so bad we decided to leave and didn't leave a tip on the table. What a big disappointment! We always go to Tommy Bahama's restaurant at town square, the ambiance is 100X better and food is excellent, food might be a bit expensive but it's worth it. Not going back to crab corner, We don't like the crabby customer service. We should have listened to our instincts.",

We went on a Friday night and the place was absolutely amazing empty.  Despite the few people in the restaurant, service was slow and inattentive. We had a really hard time getting the server's attention.  My real issue is with the food. We started a dozen oysters, which did not taste fresh at all.  We then ordered their signature blue crap.  They offer 5 different sizes, from regular with jumbo.  Go big or go home right? We opted to for for jumbo crabs, which were 3X the price of regular crabs.  Well, we went big and had to go home anyways. The jumbo crabs were smaller than the size of my hands. There were about 3-4 bites of meat inside.  The legs were so skinny that they were practically empty.   After spending $70 for two people, we were still hungry. We ended up going to another restaurant for more food.",

And some other(can you tell I'm horrible with names?) I think he was bald, also had a great attitude. So I am shocked to hear about 'bad service' in some reviews.  I ordered the soft shell crab sandwich- which I loved. I didn't know what to expect when I ordered it but it was sooo tasty . My husband had the po'boy with all 3 fish options and he loved it. My mom ordered the two crab cake entree and it was so UH-MaZING!!!! This is officially one of our new favorite spots!!! Only reason I took off a star was because it was kind of warm inside the restaurant. But other than that I'll be back!!  ** UPDATE: I should've added that traffic in the restaurant was also pretty busy, we came in right before happy hour I think. And still, great service",

    "text": "Thank you crab corner for topping off my Vegas get away.  I am sad to hear you folks closed your old location. We always made a point to stop in at that spot every time we came to Vegas before heading home even though we knew you had the rainbow location.  Thankfully,  we were only 15 minutes away from our casino and decided we had to make a beeline over to you before leaving Vegas. The Mahi Mahi was highly recommended by your attentive staff. I have to say the taste was as promised.  Only wish the portion would have been a bit bigger.  The other food fare that is always a must is your shrimp basket that never disappoints. Please consider opening a location in northern California specifically in the Bay Area. The folks out here would love your food.",

    "text": "I won't be back here. The food is average yet expensive and the service is bad/rude. I will, however, throw a shout-out to the Crab Corner over on Eastern Blvd though...they were super nice. So I highly recommend you try that one instead.  I ended up getting a \"Combo Platter\" which is your choice of (all fried) cod, shrimp, oysters, catfish, clams or chicken strips. I asked if I could get steamed/boiled shrimp instead of fried since I didn't want to consume so much fried food but was told no. Unless your body is used to eating massive amounts of fried food you may want to steer clear of this. I felt awful and hated myself the rest of the day.   Our server, Jared, was well past the 'unhelpful' threshold and operated in the 'rude' category. Here's a fun exchange showing how helpful he was (verbatim): Me: How much are 6 crabs? Jared: They are priced by the dozen. Me: How much are a dozen? Jared: What size? Me: ?...Medium. Jared: $64 I think this whole exchange could have been shortened. But granted he did then tell me 6 would be $32 since I apparently don't look like the type that can do complex math with the facts thus provided.   As I awaited him to come by so I could request the check, the ample time allowed me to check-in and find a deal for \"any beer for $3\"! Thanks Yelp! I asked to apply that to my bill as well as inform him we'd be using a Living Social. He balked at this saying you can only use one \"discount\". I scoffed right back so I was allowed to use both after a talk with the manager...\"but just this once.\"  Now I'm not sure if anyone else is with me, but I don't consider Groupons or Living Socials \"discounts\". They are marketing tools made 1) to get customers into the restaurant, 2) are pre-purchased, and 3) are known sunk costs. Whereas discounts/coupons are used to get people in but that's where the similarities end - they do not know how many people will take advantage of it, etc. Who's with me?  Well we could talk the finer points of economics all day but I will close with the fact that I do not recommend this place at all.",

When we picked up a shrimp from the sampler, suddenly our server came and took out the sampler from our table without any explanation.  Later he came back with different sampler and said it was not ours. And then I saw he brought out the same sampler from kitchen later.  Overall this restaurant is not recommendable because of the service. It would be much better if he explained us before he just took out the food without saying anything.",

We kept on having to ask the server to refill drinks and order more beer; plus extra napkins, etc.....Hence, the server should be asking us.....They need a good manager who pays attention to the front as much as the back to solve this problem.",

I'm not a big sandwich person and this is a sandwich I would eat everyday! The bread they use I believe is garlic bread, then their coleslaw is a perfect balance of sweet and salty that goes perfectly with their fresh crispy fried oysters. They are also generous with the portions of oysters within the sandwich. In addition to good food they are super friendly and show they appreciate and value your business. I cannot understand why this place is only 3.5 stars they deserve to be 4-5! I definitely will be back and I hope I can try their other crab dishes if I can stop myself from craving their oyster po boy :)!",

    "text": "I finally got to go to crab corner on Saturday with my daughter & my friend. It was her first time going as well.  I heard alot of good reviews & the pictures looked delicious. I enjoyed the food very much the garlic steam pot was just like the pictures I saw & I could see why it was $64.99. The reason why I couldn't give them 5 stars was due our waiter Greg. I informed him that we had separate bills me & my daughter from my friend.  I asked for the garlic steam pot & he went into how much it cost like I couldn't afford it then he went on to say it's alot of food for just the two of us & how it's enough for 3 people.  I was like wait a minute why is he trying to get me to change my order & how does he know we couldnt eat it all. It's my money let me get what I want I felt like he didn't want me order it. My friend was kinda unsure because she wanted both catfish & fried oysters so he offered to combine her plate with both instead of ordering them separately. I ordered 2 appetizers mini crab cakes (delicious) & crab pretzel.  I got one appetizer b4 dinner & the other one (crab pretzel) came with our entrees.  Since my crab pretzel came with our food I didn't get to eat it cuz I wanted to enjoy our entrees b4 our food got cold. I didn't understand that.  Then on top of that when my friend plate arrived she only had fried oysters her catfish was missing. She had to wait 10 more minutes for them to deliver 1 piece of fish. No butter was given to us for our crabs & I had to ask twice for napkins. Our waiter was no where to be found. I had to ask the hostess who seated us for butter. I could see our waiter talking & laughing with other customers sitting around us & I tried to call him by his name to get his attend but he walked off like he didn't hear. The couple he was talking to right next to us felt the need to say I'm sorry after they saw me trying to get his attention.  He never checked in with us too see if we needed anything only to apologize to my friend for messing up her order.We both felt he didn't deserve a tip but being the person I am I gave him $5 dlrs & she gave him $3 dlrs.  All in all I would go back for the food the fried soft crab & those crab cakes is worth my return just hopefully I get a different waiter.",

We had a few things from the HH menu including dozen oysters (fresh, but on the small side), bacon wrapped shrimp (tasty), and calamari fries (fried like a chicken tender).  We also had lobster bisque (way too salty), crab soup (reminiscent of Manhattan clam chowder), and soft-shell crab dinner. The garlic green beans and onion ring sides were perfectly cooked.   All in all, the food was good, but I have to say I didn't feel like I got a great value even with the HH deals and the Groupon we had. It's not particularly expensive per se (as we regularly spend way more for a good meal out),  but I didn't feel like anything knocked my socks off. But I gave an added star for the great service.   We had a good time here, particularly with the great afternoon weather on the patio. There are a few hammocks that were fun for my daughter to play around while we waited for the food.",

Our very quick  and pleasant server's name was Kimmy & she was absolutely on point! She had an intelligent, knowledgeable answer for all of our questions.

There was a sufficient amount of crab also, which was sweet tasting. I also had the crab cake sandwich...excellent! Oh my! They put very little binder in it, it was made up of almost all, and I mean all, crab! So good. I enjoyed lunch so much, ended up going again with the family for dinner. It was louder and busier, very much a pub setting. Had the fried clam dinner. Again, excellent. The clams were huge, much larger than I've ever had. Hubby had the shrimp, and it did not disappoint. It's great to have an authentic Maryland seafood restaurant on the southwest side of town. Worth the trip even if you are across town.",

Frsh brewed tea was a great compliment to the stemaed crab fare.  Saw lots of locals who were enjoying other food and specials.  One of the Best Brab House I have been to.  Best in Las Vegas.  Not a buffet with overcooked or boiled frozen crabs.  The crabs served at the Crab Corner were fresh, hot, and made to order.  Wish they opened one in the Boston area.",

    "text": "My wife and I had been wanting to try this restaurant for some time. We came on a Saturday for an early dinner (3:45p). Aside from the bar, there were only two tables occupied. It took a couple of minutes to be seated, and the hostess had trouble finding a clean table. The server was quick to take our drink order; however, he told me that he had to check to make sure they had the stuff to mix my drink. Which is fine - i get that, but he disappeared for 10 minutes after that and never confirmed whether or not I had to choose a different drink. I watched him flirt and socialize with different employees before he returned to our table with drinks in hand.  After that we had to wait an additional 10 minutes to have our order taken. The food came pretty quickly after that. The bacon wrapped scallops were really tasty, but you only get 4 scallops that were on the small side for $14, so it was a bit overpriced. The lobster bisque was very well done... would have preferred more lobster chunks instead of the slivers, but I was grateful for what was there compared to the crab soup that my spouse got. There wasn't any discernable piece of crab to be found in the otherwise tasty veggie soup. Maybe it was just the portions we were given... not sure.  We ordered the garlic blue crab, peel and eat shrimp, homemade potato salad, and onion rings. The potato salad was excellent! The onion rings were battered nicely, but they would have been much better if paired with some kind of cheese dipping sauce. When we asked for that, we were told that the only sauces available were salad dressings, which was disappointing. The shrimp was tasty, decently sized and portioned for the price. We were rather disappointed with the crab. We were given 3 blue crabs smothered in a garlic sauce. Maybe blue crab is small in nature, but the actual meat inside the crab was mushy and difficult to extract from the shell. We are used to eating snow, dungeness, and king crab, so we didn't really consider the crab to be an accurate reflection of the restaurant's abilities.   As we live in North Las Vegas, and stopped by this place because we were in the area, I don't believe we will be returning anytime soon. However, if a location opens up closer to us, we would consider returning to try other items on the menu.",

    "text": "We visited this restaurant about a week and a half ago and were hoping for a nice night out. Me and my wife came in expecting to do the AYCE crab special that was on Monday nights. We came into the restaurant and it reeked of old bay seasoning and that bad fish smell you find in old markets. We weren't too upset by this, just figured it was part of the atmosphere. We ordered our food and had about 6-8 very small blue crabs dropped off at our table. We have never eaten crabs like this before and how no idea how to do it, but the waiter just left them there on the table and walked away. There was very little meat in the crabs and the act of ripping them open and seeing the \"gut mustard\" was absolutely disgusting and enough to ruin our appetite. We attempted to eat it and realized there was no way we would get full or even stomach it. The manager told us he would charge us for 6 of the crabs plus our appetizers and that he would bring us out some King Crab legs that we ordered instead. The crab legs were good but after our clothes and body were covered in crab juice and old bay seasoning, we weren't able to enjoy it from the stench that was burned into our nostrils.  We didn't expect what happened next, the waiter gave us our bill for $80 which included the crab we didn't even eat... What type of customer service is that? Especially in Las Vegas... I do not see this place surviving here long and definitely warn people to avoid it, not worth the time, money, or the amount of detergent it will take to get that smell out of your clothes.",

We like others that wrote reviews, heard a lot of negative feedback but decided to try it ourselves. BIG MISTAKE! Besides being very small it was very dark and could not read the menu very well and very loud. We were not in the mood for cleaning crabs but thought they would have a fairly decent seafood menu. Wrong again, very limited menu!! My wife got the crab cobb salad and I got the crabcake dinner (only got 1 as 2 would be $28). Asked the waiter if they really flew in crabs and seafood daily from MD, he said \"NO, they get them in every few days mostly from LA or TX or the west coast, wherever they can get them the cheapest.\" Well my wife's food was terrible and my crabcake was not that great. Crab meat, yes but very dry and the inside was lacking flavor. The only thing that gave it flavor was the outside crust, which all together looked like it came out of a box not made by a chef that knew what he was doing. My wife's salad was sooooo bad, and lacking meat, that she did not eat much of it at all. Not only that, they did not have Capt. Morgan at the bar! What bar does NOT have Capt. Morgan?? Don't game there because it will cost you $20 in the machine for every drink!! I could go on about how bad that place was overall, but I think you get the idea!! Bottom line we spent over $40 and went away hungry and went somewhere to get something else. I feel somewhat ashamed that they represent MD and my alma mater the Univ. of MD. If you want real seafood, go to Red Lobster!!",

We went around 5pm on a Friday night and it was easy to get a table still. The place is relatively loud however so don't expect to have any easy conversations.   First off, the food is good but nothing to write home about. There wasn't really anything that we didn't like but we've been to steakhouses or non seafood restaurants that had better fish. I got the soft shell crab sandwich which doesn't come with any side so I ordered onion rings, and my wife got the King crab legs and a $3 happy hour beer. We shared a crab cake platter which comes with two very small sides. All of this came out to $75 with tax which in our opinion was far overpriced.   The real disappointing part of this place is the service. We did get seated quickly but then we didn't really see our waiter the whole time. He and and took our order and then just disappeared. Also, they delivered people's food to the table uneven leaving some eating and some still waiting for the I food for quite awhile. When we finally got our checks, the wrong items were on our checks and it took forever to get someone over to take the checks.   Long story short, we won't be returning.",

So I see yelp and this place that looked like they had a Maryland feel. Not even close to crab cake sandwiches in Maryland. Also the calamari fries were not seasoned at all, very tasteless. I know its a seafood restaurant, but as I walked in the aroma of spoiled seafood hit my nose.  Other yelp reviews complained about the service. I did not experience anything wrong with the service, it was fine to me, just the food didn't taste anything like it did in Maryland to me for the same prices. Don't think I'll be back.",

The fish was cold and greasy 2 pieces about the size of two Chicken McNuggets each. the soft shell crab platter had three very small soft shell crabs with were also served cold, soggy and very greasy not much flavor at all. At first the service was fine because there was only 2 tables seated ,at the end of our meal the restaurant was almost completely full they only had one waitress doing work ...two other people kind of wandering around and a bus boy who was trying his best.

When we walked in we saw a table of endless crab piled high, however, since breakfast wasn't hours and hours ago for us, we decided on appetizers. WRONG CHOICE TO MAKE..  I started w/the Maryland Crab soup which tasted exactly like it came from a can. I had two bites and couldn't tolerate the \"can\" remnants left on my tongue. Slowly (very slowly) our 3 appetizers came out to the table by two (the only two) waiters in the place who would play a video game each and every time they passed the large, out of place, golf game. As my  Pepsi cup sat empty, I watched as both waiters made direct beelines for the game at every opportunity they could- which was about every 30 seconds....  So, out came our  undercooked Scallops wrapped in  beyond burnt bacon, our Calamari fries that did not taste or look anything comparable to Calamari, and the Crab cakes- which were the ONLY food we had that we both actually enjoyed....   I would ONLY come back to try their Mon special which is endless crabs piled on the table.. I grew up on Long Island, and we LOVEd to go crabbing- so when family comes into town we will go back for the CRABS ONLY...... CRABS and soda- that's it..........   Good luck folks........",

First of all the the calamari was very chewy, I have never had calamari that was so chewy that it made your jaw hurt. Food started to come out...we had order two lobster rolls, kids chicken fingers, clams, cheeseburger and blackened mahi mahi. Everyone food but the cheeseburger and mahi mahi came out, waited another 20 minutes or so for the burger and then another 15 for the mahi mahi.  Waited another 15 minutes for someone to come by to so I may ask for tartar sauce, after no one coming to attend to us I got up and walked over to the bar where the server was sitting on her cell phone to ask her for some tartar sauce.  Waited for another while and thought maybe they forgot about us since we had to call out if anyone was there to give us our check. I had asked prior to leaving because they already had added the gratuity which I felt was not deserved.  They had stated that their internet was down and they needed to run our cards the old way imprinted. After walking out they closed the place early due to Internet not working. I called and spoke with Rina, manager and explained how I felt I shouldn't have had to be forced to pay for the gratuity at a certain amount when the service was bad. Rina apologized and said your card was not run due to Internet being down, which I checked on my account and it wasn't. She stated that the next morning she will run it with a gratuity of my choice minus our drinks...didn't happen. Checked my account first thing and it was run first thing for the full amount. So I called. Spoke with Rina, asked what was going on, mind you she was to call me first thing this morning to give me a new total amount. She now explains that the card was ran last night, but wait I thought the Internet was down? She puts Richard on who is the higher up and he can't do anything says he has to talk to the owner. I finally said you what forget it. I just can't believe this place. Never going back for sure, be careful if they tell you their internet is not up and what they charge you. They brought out the burger without the side and when they did bring out the side it was an upgrade and here we are thinking fires comes with a burger. Food is just ok for the prices and the service is horrible!!!!",

We have become used to be treated like weekly regulars at Eastern, being recognized and acknowledged by staff even only visiting every 3-4months. The same treatment was received at the SW location on our first visit. Last night our service was poor at best. The young man was inattentive and ignored us for the majority of time we were there. The rest of the wait staff were not interested in covering for one another, walking by numerous times without inquiring about our needs. The waiter wanted to blame the poor service on \"busy\", not really for a Friday evening and being shorthanded, not really. I think there was no manager on duty.... Great food, poor service. We can find that many places. We will visit Eastern next time, hope the experience improves, or find a new place..... Really bums me out.....",

Everything else we ordered was fried which may be where we went wrong. The cod was oil soaked, shrimp was edible but dense in a strange kind of way and the clams had a rubber band texture. The French fries were pretty good. Service was acceptable but I am pretty much convinced if you are not going for the actual crab fest, go elsewhere.

Pricey, Plan to spend $13+ for lunch. We consider this expensive for a work day lunch. So, we opted for the special soup which was $8 for a styrofoam bowl full. *shudders at styrofoam*  The waiter raved about the crab soup over the lobster bisque so we tried it. My co worker liked it, but I only ate half which is highly unusual for me. It was a bit fishy for my liking, seemed they were masking smelly cheap crab with too heavy paste like cream & lots of pepper. Even ran into a shell chip or two. Ick. The only thing that got me really crabby ( bad pun) was it took over 1/2 hour for them to ladle out 2 bowls of soup, plunk down a handful of saltines, and napkins. Ridiculous! I will say the hush puppies we split were top notch.. The ambience is horrible, school bus yellow walls with stop sign red below chair rail, think nursery school, or sports team. Ya I get they're football fans but its a bit too teenage boys bedroom. Coincidentally, all the wait staff & cooks were younger asian men...Not sure what that means? Its an oxymoron, I don't put Maryland crab expertise..think fishermen, think sea captains, think east coast old world, think Loyola, ...with surfer dudes toting iPods.  Either way, Service was laughably bad, food pricey for fried fare, ambience none existent. Doubt we will return.",
