    "text": "Debating what we should eat after a long 6 1/2 hour drive to Vegas, my wife and I decided to go to the Grand Lux Cafe because she wanted one thing and I wanted another. The best way to compromise was to pick a restaurant with plenty of diverse choices on its menu and the Grand Lux Cafe had fit this bill.   To wind down from this road trip, we needed some booze. I had originally wanted a beer but this was one area of the menu lacking a lot of selection, so I opted to go with a glass of Chianti instead. My wife drank the mojito which she absolutely loved. In fact, she wanted to go back here for the mojito alone.   For starters, we decided to go with the crabcakes along with an order of house salad. The crabcakes were fried lump crab meat and came with a side of mustard aioli sauce for dipping. I thought these crabcakes were alright. I normally like them lightly fried and these came out extra crispy from the fryer. It was not my idea of a great crabcake but it was not bad either. My sentiment was the same for the house salad.   The pepperoni pizza was oval shaped and cooked on an artisan flatbread in a wood fire stove. Just like the crabcakes, it came out extra crunchy from being slightly overcooked. And just like the crabcakes, it was about an average pizza. I would have liked more cheese and tomato sauce to counter balance this crispiness.   My wife's trout was unexpectedly great. We were worried after the pizza and crabcakes this would come out dry from being overcooked.  However, they did a terrific job seasoning it and grilling it to perfection. It was very moist and flavorful. The trout was served with a side of white rice and some broccoli.   The service here was awesome. Rating the service alone I would give our waiter five stars. He was delightful and attentive the entire time.   My wife struck gold with her entree and drink and maybe I do the same next time by ordering different items from the menu. With that said, Grand Lux Cafe definitely deserves three stars.",

    "text": "This is one of the restaurants I visit EVERY TIME I'm in Vegas, bar none!  What I like about this place is that it's open 24 hours, and serves DELICIOUS FOOD, something I find is very rare in a 24 hour establishment.    There's a long story about this restaurant, a sister-restaurant of the Cheesecake Factory (another favorite of mine)!  Apparently, when the Venetian was being built, they wanted to put a Cheesecake Factory there.  But, due to the fact that there's already a Cheesecake Factory \"a few blocks down the strip\" at the Caesar's Forum Shops, and the Cheesecake Factory wouldn't allow another location just blocks away from another Cheesecake Factory.  So, the developer of the Venetian negotiated a deal to open a very similar restaurant, but with a different name and menu.  I'm so glad they did that!    Favorite items here include the fried chicken and waffles (ask for regular maple syrup, instead of the \"maple butter sauce\" that normally comes with it), and their Indochine chicken and shrimp, amazing flavors and ingredients make this a delicious choice!  Oh, and order a box of their freshly baked chocolate chip cookies, they run circles around Mrs. Fields or any other cookies I've ever purchased, they taste exactly like the Tollhouse cookies my mother used to make from the recipe on the back of Nestle Chocolate Chips, so delicious, and tastes like they use real butter and the same ingredients you'd use if you were making cookies from scratch (not the preservatives, high fructose corn syrups, margerine or other \"crappy ingredients\" in the ready to bake cookie dough in supermarkets.  I get these every time I'm in Vegas!    Definitely one of, if not the best, 24 hour restaurants I've ever been to!  And I've probably tried this place a dozen or so times, food is always excellent!  I haven't found any other 24 hour restaurants in Vegas (or anywhere else, except maybe Los Angeles) that are worth eating at!  Try this place, I'm sure you'll be glad you did!",

Both times we received diligent and personable service. Happy hour drink and app specials are worth visiting for. A number of cocktails go from $12 to $5 during happy hour. Drinks were stout. We sampled menu items from mega dinosaur sized salads to fall off the bone baby back ribs.

Anyway,Grand Lux atmosphere is almost identical to cheescake factory, dimmed lights, marble floors and walls, nicely structured place. I think the one in palazzo has better food .. or chef than the one at venetian. Better service too.  We ordered th ceviche, which was fresh and delicious, and I ordered the jambalaya. not bad! It definitely isnt the best restauarant in town, but its good, i'd go back if im staying at the palazzo or venetian again.",

My stay has been fine, but the way I was treated at the Grand Lux is one of the worst customer service experiences I have ever witnessed. Not only were we disregarded by the staff entirely, but the food was delivered over an hour after order.   When our bill arrived, no one asked if we were even guests of the hotel - which, we are.   A conversation with the manager over our concerns did not help. He only put the blame back on us.  All in all, I was given the least amount of respect as a human being deserves.   Food is chain-level. Would give negative stars if possible.",

We went at about 6:30 on a Sunday night and were immediately seated.  The menu is very reminiscent of Cheesecake Factory in it's size Anne variety. Among the family we ordered three pasta dishes, fish and chips, and fried chicken.   We also had the calamari appetizer which comes with fried shrimp, onions, and zucchini (the latter only nominally, buy if I am ordering calamari I would rather they skimp on the zucchini than the calamari). It was really tasty and the portion was large enough that my family of five was all able to get a decent portion.  Back to the main courses, I had the fried chicken, which is usually what you will find me ordering if I is on a menu. The seasoning appears to be a simple  salt and pepper base, and it was done to perfection. Crispy on the outside, moist in the inside, not too much batter, and good flavor. It was half of a chicken with the breast deboned but the other pieces bone in. Mashed potatoes were reminiscent of CF.  All of the rest of the family loved their dishes as well. The only problem is that we didn't have a refrigerator at our hotel so we couldn't take our leftovers!",

Let's start by saying that the food is the same as every other Grand Lux I've been to - it's good, but not spectacular, and they have options for everyone.  What makes things stand out (or not) is the service.  Lunch - we had good service - our waiter was very attentive.  I opted for a soup and salad plate -the salad, as normal, is reasonable.  The soup was a nice creamy chicken soup - overall pleasing.  Breakfast the next day - seriously? A queue?  ANd thats just to get sat - expect a 20 minute wait once you get sat.  Service sucked the big one.  However, they do have a buffet, so at least you can skip the waiting for your food as well.  We went in for a quick breakfast and ended up being late to the show.  Prices - good, even in comparison to non-Las Vegas places.  If you are looking for cheap eats in the hotel, this is the place for you.  Sorry - I can only give this an average grade - it's good but not spectacular, and breakfast service drags it down.",

They have all different types of food to satisfy your tastes and the portions are large enough to keep you full for most of the day. We came here for Sunday lunch and the staff here were quick to accommodate a large hungry party. The waitress was very nice and even made sure to bring out my friend's order first because she wasn't feeling very well. A few downers included items that weren't available because they ran out by mid-day, which is pretty inexcusable. The nice thing is that lunch prices are very cheap compared to dinner. A lot of people opted to get the salad, soup, and sandwich combo, which gets you a lot for cheap. I got the chicken jambalaya, expecting pasta, but got white rice instead. it was still good, but tasted more Asian than anything else despite the spiciness.  I had my eyes set of some beignets that I saw go to another table, but like I said, the portions are enough to keep you full so I passed when it came time for dessert.",

I had a less-than-favorable meal at the Chicago Grand Lux but thought it was just a fluke. Wrong! Last week I had a meal at the Grand Lux at the Palazzo which was worse. We both ordered Salmon Picatta which took 20+ minutes to be served (tables after us were getting served faster). When the meal was finally presented it was cold, so I asked to speak to a manager. A rotund man approached the table and asked what was wrong, so we told him. He then said, would we like him to take back the meals and heat them up for us? Are you kidding?! Yeah, right, like we want our two cold meals zapped in a microwave. He should have offered to remake the meals; unfortunately, that was his only solution. That trip was the last one I will ever make to a Grand Lux Cafe ANYWHERE! This chain is owned by the Cheesecake Factory and should have much higher levels of service, quality and management. I hope the Venetian & Palazzo don't renew their leases when they expire--the restaurant doesn't speak well for the hotel which is one of the best on the strip. Oh yeah, one more thing: Get rid of that lazy, obese, ineffectual manager. He is doing the place a lot of harm!!",

I forgot what its called but they had some sort of Asian soup there, it was surprising really good for an American place (The soup is great after a night of drinking)  The kick up chili was a little to salty. Fried Chicken and Waffles was too sweet. My favorite was the Warm Homemade Chocolate Chip Pecan Cookies. Yummm Chicken Royale was good also.  The only down side is the wait, I think we waited 30 -40 mins for our food. (We did have a big group though)  Prices can be high. Their menu is HUGE! I had a hard time deciding on what to get. They have a little bit of everything.   I can't wait till my next Vegas trip so that I can try something new.",

Seared Ahi Tuna wrapped in seaweed served with wasabi mayo and a bean sprout salad, cucumber salad, and  carrot salad - thinly sliced seared Ahi Tuna complemented with a thin wrapping of unsalted seaweed. A perfect light appetizer to start your meal.   2. Shrimp Scampi with linguini served in a white wine sauce.  -  This dish was really delicious, albeit a bit on the heavy side b/c of the white wine cream sauce. The shrimp were huge and flavorful, and the white wine sauce had a very tasty citrius flavor to it.   3. Pinapple Mojito - pinapple was not overly sweet, or tart. However, they did not muddle th mint leaves enough to bring out the flavors commonly found in a mojito. After a few minutes of mashing up the decorative mint in the glass the mojito tasted a LOT better.   On a side note the sourdough bread served prior to ordering is quite tasty. I love how crusty it is and it serves as a great tool to sop up the delicious white wine sauce for our scampi dish. YUMMMY! I'd definitely eat here again. :D",

    "text": "You know, I really want to hate this place because it's so chain-y and mass produced and they have so damn many menu options that are all over the board.  But, I just can't hate it.  In fact, I kinda like it.  I've been here a few times for breakfast (a la carte, not the buffet) and it's always solid.  The omelets are good, and so is the French toast, hash browns, coffee, toast, everything.  I also recently stopped here for drinks (their fancy drinks are pretty good) and a late dinner, and I was very pleased, too.  Dinner is tougher because they do have so many different options.  It was hard to decide but I was pleased to see a large selection of salads, sandwiches, appetizers and smaller entrees as well as larger specialty entrees and pastas.  We were a party of six and everyone's food looked great, and everyone seemed to enjoy their meal.  I had the chicken flatbread which was well-seasoned, tasty and HUGE.  It was way too much food for one person.  I was also thrilled that they substituted tasty mashed sweet potatoes for the fries that were supposed to come with my meal and there was no additional charge.  The service is very good here.  I think they are very well-trained and they execute well, and they're friendly.  The prices are pretty reasonable, especially for the amount of food you get.  I am pretty certain I will be back here since it seems to be part of my normal Las Vegas repertoire.",

Both times the service was just ok, but, notably, we were a large group of at least 18 on both mornings. We did not have to wait more than 3 minutes to be seated either day, even though only half of our group had arrived... and they continued to wander in throughout the meal.  I enjoyed Joe's Scramble on my first morning... delicious and so much of it! I felt like I had just as much food as on the buffet the next morning. In fact, most of my group ordered off of the menu on that first visit, and everyone commented on the huge portions. While the buffet does offer an omelet station, I wasn't impressed with it, nor the buffet, especially not for the price of more than $20. The omelet line was very long & I was rather hungry so I found other things to eat from the buffet instead of waiting in line. The available buffet food was very good... but simply not much of a selection. If we'd gone to breakfast for a 3rd time, I would've ordered from the menu again... that Joe's Scramble was fantastic!",

    "text": "During my two recent family stay cations on the Las Vegas Strip, there was a dining experience in the Grand Lux Cafe. They were grand luxury dining experiences that were reasonably priced.      Before reporting on my two recent dining experiences in The Grand Lux Cafe back in late March and May, I will bring up a few facts about the glorified cafe of the Palazzo Resort. First, the menu is large covering a selection of food ranging from baguettes to salmon and from $6.95 to $33.95. Second, the Cheesecake Factory is the parent company. That is not surprising considering how large the menu is. Third, Grand Lux Cafe features a bar plus an in-house bakery. And fourth, Grand Lux Cafe rocks. I will elucidate why on the preceding paragraphs.      The two times that my family and I dined in the Grand Lux Cafe were before a show. The funny thing is that in its own way, Grand Lux Cafe is similar to a show. The stage is an elegant restaurant and the delicious menu items are the stars. The Grand Lux Cafe dining environment compliments the elegance and luxury of the Palazzo. The marble floors, textures, fabrics, silverware, handkerchief napkins, and interior create a sense of dining in an elegant restaurant. In reality this is an upscale Cheesecake Factory. The first time we dined here we sat deep inside the restaurant with a view overlooking the bar. On the follow-up visit, we sat in the indoor patio overlooking the Palazzo casino.      On the first visit, I enjoyed the lunch special salmon piccata with a creamy lemon sauce with capers, artichokes, and mushrooms over a steamed rice. The entry for this meal was around $15. I ordered a Coke that added to the price. This meal left me satisfied.     On the second visit, I ordered the chicken parmesan. The guarguantium portion of chicken breast covered with parmesan bread crumbs, melted hot Mozzarella cheese, and tomato sauce over pasta put me on cloud 9. The amount of quality food that they served me was really a two-parter. If I wasn't on a stay cation, half of it would of gone to my refrigerator and warmed up the next day. The entry to this dining experience was around $20. Like last time I ordered a Coke that added to the price. This meal left me very satisfied.     Proceeding both meals that I had in this Grand Lux Cafe was a basket of complimentary warm house bread. Also on both visits, we had a friendly and attentive server.      When I review restaurants on the touristy Las Vegas Strip, the question is, \"would I patronize the place if it was off the Strip?\"  This leads into the question, \"If Grand Lux Cafe was off the Strip would I patronize it?\" Absolutely! The food and the amount they give you at a reasonable price inside a restaurant environment that blends the grandeur of European cafes with the American restaurant makes it competitive to many of the local restaurants in Las Vegas. Until and if they build an off-Strip Grand Lux Cafe, I anticipate patronizing this or its sister location at the Venetian in the future.",

Whenever my friends or family are stumped about where we should go out to eat and don't mind heading to the Strip, Grand Lux is our default option. It's one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. They have a HUGE menu. I admit that it can be a little overwhelming, but if you have picky eaters in your circle, this cafe is a great option. The price is decent for what it's worth. We've always received great customer service. The cafe is clean and the decorations are beautiful. It has a good vibe around it. There are a few options on the menu that are pretty unique. If you're looking to try something new and a little different, I recommend the asian nachos. I get them every time I visit and am never disappointed. Just about the only thing I can complain about though is the noise. It's not the cafe's fault, but they are located on the casino floor so if you came to have dinner and chit chat, it can be hard to hear or hold a conversation because you'll be contending with the sounds of slot machines and tourists.  I can't say enough good things about Grand Lux Cafe. I will keep going there and recommending them to everyone I know.",

The food came out quickly and the salad was delicious. My chicken pot pie was very filling and I didn't manage to eat the entire thing. There was the filling on the bottom, and a layer of flaky crust in top. It had good flavor, but I think the filling could have been cooked a little longer to make the vegetables inside a little bit more tender. Overall, I had a great time at Grand Lux Cafe.",

Thank goodness! Just what I was hoping for!  The chicken pot pie was good to great. I'm not a big meat fan in pot pie and it had very little chicken in it. Some others might be disappointed by that, but there was enough chicken to have some in every few bites. The chicken it's self was sometime a bit tender and mostly a little bit tough. But the veggies were quite tender and the sauce had a fantastic flavor. Mild hint of white wine, not overpowering. The peas tasted especially fresh and green so I appreciated that a lot. Potatoes soft and well done, not firm and dreadful like 70% of pot pies have. The pie crust was good for a restaurant. Flaky, tender and firm at the same time. Decent flavor on its own. Not excessively buttery or dry.  Im glad I came back because I tried this place a couple days ago and the food wasn't as good so I was nervous. It's in the Palazzo where I was staying and I'm glad laziness won out because I was happy with lunch!",

I think it was a bit too crispy. They first brought out tartar sauce and then quickly swapped it for the marinara it was supposed to have. My main course was a Cuban sandwich. Nicely done with smoked pork, pickles and melted cheese.",

Taking Yelp's suggestions, y boyfriend and I made sure to come during Happy Hour. $6 appetizers and drinks! Appetizers were much larger in size than we had expected. We got the Buffalo chicken egg rolls and fried spring rolls. These and the bread offered to us was already enough to fill us up. We still had two more plates of pasta coming our way- garlic Parmesan and a lemon chicken piccata. Each was delicious!! This place reminds me of a Cheesecake Factory, but maybe even better. Prices were good for a casino, and service from our waiter Pierre was amazing. He made useful suggestions and was kind enough to look for us at the slot machines outside the restaurant when we forgot our credit card on the table. Nice place to come for a celebration- or just happy hour :-)",

I was blown away by the classy-look and warm atmosphere and when i looked at the menu, the prices were definitely affordable! For starters, hubby and I had the duck the triangles appetizer (crispy wonton wrappers filled with minced onions, garlic and seasonings.) It was delicious! For the main dish, I had pasta with chicken, sun-dried tomatoes & mushroom... Love it!! The garlic cream sauce was really good! I ended up dipping the complementary bread to the sauce and it was satisfying. Like eating for two, it's meant to be shared. Meanwhile, hubby had the grilled salmon sandwich filled with Fuji Apple slaw, lemon aioli sauce, tomato & onion. He too was pleased with his order. Definitely coming back! Thanks Palazzo!",

    "text": "I'm a little torn about this place now. Had I reviewed it a couple years ago, it would have been all positive, however, so much has changed. I've been dining at Grand Lux Cafe consistently since they opened until a couple years ago (I had previously frequented the Venetian location). Granted, I didn't frequent as often in the last 2-3 years since Las Vegas' local restaurant scene has stepped up and I found new, better spots to obsess. But, it was my visit in September 2013 that turned me away. The quality has diminished significantly and dishes that were once favorites, are now very disappointing! Also, food portions have gotten smaller and prices have remained the same (or increased). Where's the money going?  One of my favorite sections of their menu is the Grand Salads. Large portions for around $13-17. My favorites are the Southwestern Salad and the Manhattan Salad. They've changed the Manhattan Salad a bit since I first had it a few years ago, but it's still good. I like the fresh beets and the large assortment of fresh vegetables and legumes; plus, the house vinaigrette is great. The last time I had this salad, however, it was oddly NOT chopped. Maybe someone got lazy that day? I'd hate to think that it's just served like that now. View photos below:  Exhibit A: Manhattan Salad in August 2014 (What a chopped salad should look like). <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-5?select=N_rprbjxzdz2HNz-25Bkfg#N_rprbjxzdz2HNz-25Bkfg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gran...</a>  Exhibit B: Manhattan Salad in October 2014 (This is what I was served just two months later). <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-5?select=aCNz4-XJiHTb6KoH7KTcMA#aCNz4-XJiHTb6KoH7KTcMA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gran...</a>  I haven't tried a lot of their newer Small Salads, but they used to serve a really nice Spicy Calamari Salad. Delicious and crispy calamari and fresh greens with these two wonderful sauces/dressing. It's a shame that it's no longer on the menu.   Other dishes that I've enjoyed: Empanadas, Buffalo Chicken Bites, Double Stuffed Potato Spring Rolls, Buffalo Chicken Rolls, Crispy Thai Shrimp & Chicken Rolls, Pasta Pomodoro, Cajun Shrimp & Chicken Jambalaya, and Indochine Shrimp & Chicken.  Oh, their New Orleans Beignets are fantastic! They're made to order, so you'll need to order in the beginning of your meal. They have a great batter and I love the sauces: Jack Daniels Creme Anglaise, Raspberry, and Chocolate. The creme anglaise is magic and I love mixing it with the tart raspberry sauce. It's divine.  Their burgers are good (or at least they were good the last time I had them). Thick, juicy Angus burgers that are cooked to order (medium rare, yay!). I've also enjoyed their sandwiches. My go-to sandwich used to be the Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich. I ordered this staple again during my visit in December and it was TERRIBLE. I just don't understand what's going on! I've had this sandwich multiple times and there have never been any issues. The sandwich was messily assembled and there was NO flavor. I think they may changed the mayo (website shows black bean mayo?) because I'm pretty sure it used to have a spicy element that gave it zing. They should probably rename the sandwich and take out the word 'spicy' because now the only \"spicy\" ingredient is the pepper jack cheese.  More disappointment: Their fries used to be so great and now they're horrible! Also, I recently tried another one of my go-to favorites, Chicken Pot Pie, and it has strayed so far from what it used to be. Such a shame.  I just had the Kale and Avocado Salad (Fresh kale, avocado, spicy roasted poblano chiles, black beans, feta cheese, onions, toasted pumpkin seeds, and citrus vinaigrette) on my most recent visit last month and it was fantastic! I couldn't believe how great it was after so many disappointments recently. It has restored a little faith.  I doubt I'll attempt any of my old favorites again in fear of more disappointment, but I do still like GLC's salad selection. I'm just hoping the next time I order a Manhattan Salad, that it is indeed chopped.",

I ordered a strawberry lemonade that came with a sugared rim. The lemonade was very tasty and refreshing. For and appetizer we had the buffalo chicken egg rolls, because they were out of wings! Our server said they were yummy, and he was right! The wrap itself was light and crispy and delicious and perfect! The inside was a chicken breast mix with hot sauce and maybe cream cheese mixture... sooo stinkin good!!!  The entree I ordered was the Madeira Chicken which was basically sauteed chicken breast topped with asparagus (which I subbed green beans bc my date is allergic to asparagus!), mozzarella and their mushroom-Madeira sauce, think Marsala.  The side was mashed potatoes, and they were just ok. My friend got the Chicken Royale  which is lightly breaded sauteed chicken breasts served over a white wine butter sauce w/ mashed potatoes, green beans and carrots. He said it was very tasty... plus he ate it all up! LOL.  We were stuffed so we did not opt for desert. Haha!  The food here is just ok, I feel it needed a little more seasoning, but our server was super sweet!  Yay!",

The omelet bar was great, with plentiful ingredients and customization using oil or cooking spray, eggs, eggs pre-scrambled or egg whites, even eggs cooked to order.  The hash browns appeared to be freshly shredded.  The oatmeal looked like steel cut.  The fruit was great quality too.  Our server was great.  Even though we had the buffet, he went out of his way to make sure we had anything we needed.  When I was looking for oatmeal in the buffet area, it was out.

The hash browns were crispy and no greasy!  My husband had an omelette with a red chile hollandaise that he loved.  We also split a Belgian waffle with strawberries.... I don't care what else you order but add a BELGIAN WAFFLE to your order.  The syrup is a dolce de leche with butter concoction that is indescribably good!!!! It's the best waffle I've ever had and we're going again tomorrow morning for another.  The strawberry mimosa was yummy too.  The restaurant is very busy but service was still good. I highly recommend!",

If you're a tourist looking to eat at one of Las Vegas' renowned dining establishments this is NOT the place. If you're a local on a budget this is NOT the place.  If you're a local looking to splurge this is NOT the place. Fairly mediocre food prepared in a decent fashion.  But it's about $2 too expensive for a sandwich and about $5 too expensive for a dinner entre.  I do enjoy their short rib grilled cheese sandwich and patty melt (it's called something else but whatever). But every time I pay the bill I wonder why the hell I chose this place.   Still...the food quality is fine.  Fries could use some work though - they are pretty brutal over there.  Stale maybe?   My advice?  Pick someplace else.  If you want something cheap go to the Venetian food court which is literally a 5 minute walk away from the Palazzo.",

The portions are big and I have yet to have a bad experience with the quality.  Now it is more of a casual place to eat considering it is in the Palazzo and they have a bevy of high quality places to eat.  So if you wanted a high end place, take it somewhere else in the Venetian or Palazzo but if you want something to cater to a lot of people with different tastes and what not you can take them here and they will find something to their liking.  The menu goes from Asian to Italian to your regular meat and potatoes.  So if you are in the mood for something that you can't exactly put your finger on, stop by here and I'm sure you find it.",

Ahi tuna salad - was just okay. It was wrapped in seaweed, and the tuna was seared just right. However, the accompanying sauce wasn't memorable. The greens were plain greens. I expect some color and flavor but it was rather plain.   Short rib sloppy joe - delicious!! The only problem with this dish is that a clogged artery or a massive heart attack may occur. The meat was really tasty but really salty. It's served with butter bread. It's basically bread saturated in butter. Very bad for you but oh so delicious.   Spicy buffalo chicken flatbread - very delicious but isn't spicy. This is a great dish because it's healthy and very filling.   Burger - their burger really hit the spot for me. I love burgers and was definitely satisfies with my angus burger with added sauteed mushrooms. Excellent!!  In general, this is a great place to go to when you want to watch your wallet and still leave full. It can get a little pricey but a tab foe four people today at lunch came to only $51. That's exceptional for being in Vegas.   Is definitely come back.   P.S. Their limoncello lemonade is really delicious.",

It is of course owned by the Cheesecake factory so if you like their cuisine then  you will be in for a similar treat.  This place could easily be a 4 or 5 star place for a casual/nice eatery but it seems as if they try to turn some of their food into the food of a much more upscale establishment. This isnt bad necessarily but its often executed not quite as great as they probably hope! Maybe i'm too simple but when I order a salad I expect to be able to eat lettuce their caesar is large leaf lettuce, nestled onto each other with sparse dressing and two pieces of cheese and no croutons.. really.. REALLY... its a salad.. cut me some slack. Plus their food isn't as flavorful as cheesecake factory, which I dont consider their food super seasoned soooo... its hit or miss but generally not bad..

This particular location is a bit smaller than the location at The Venetian, but they share the same exact menu.  Grand Luxe Cafe at The Palazzo is about 50 steps from the guest elevators...so phone in an order from the room, take the elevators down to the casino level, walk for a minute and BAM your food is handed over to you right off the bat.  Given that the pricing was great for such huge portions of food and the convenience of its location, I ate exclusively here during my last Vegas hop. It doesn't hurt that I tried something different at every meal session (Breakfast, lunch, dinner) and everything tasted GREAT. The blood orange mimosas here are pricey ($9-$11 for a champagne flute sized glass), but the PERFECT way to start off a lazy hung-over morning.  Highly recommended items on the menu: duck pot-stickers, pasta carbonara, calamari appetizer, and four-cheese pizza. Hell, I'm going to assume ANYTHING on the menu is worth a shot and won't disappoint.  It's too bad this location closes at midnight as opposed to the 24/7 location next door at The Venetian.",

This place is related/linked to the Cheesecake factory, so if you've been there, you'll find the Grand Lux menu and pricing familiar.   When on my home turf, I wouldn't consider the Cheesecake Factory an expensive eat, but I wouldn't call it a cheap eat either. However, by Vegas standards, the Grand Lux, for the quality of the food served, is quite moderately priced. And I love that it's always open. In Vegas, when you're out late and hungry at 2am or later, that's awesome.  I've tried a few things here and everything has been good, but most memorable was a grilled cheese/short rib sandwich I had for lunch one time. It was literally the best grilled cheese sandwich I'd ever had in my life. It's the only way I ever want to eat a grilled cheese from now on.",

    "text": "First, I want to say that the food is good.  I'm a fan.  Never had a bad meal.  We had such bad service that they lost points on that.  The Palazzo location is rolling out some new menu items--test marketing if you will.  My friend and I ordered off that special menu.  I ordered a couple of tapas and she ordered the Bourbon chicken (I think that's what it was).  I should also mention that our server was lovely.  Very personable and courteous.  So, we ordered.  We waited about 20 minutes while chatting and out came the manager with my tapas and said to my friend, \"We're out of the chicken.  You'll have to order something else.\"  First of all, our server didn't even know that they were out of that dish.  Secondly, and this is a big second, almost everything on the menu is chicken with just a different sauce so I have trouble understanding that but maybe they ran out of sauce.  So, here's the problem:  I now have my food and my friend doesn't.  I offered to wait but then my food would get cold.  I offered to share with her but she's not an adventurous eater--no eggplant croquettes for her (but, boy howdy they were good).  So, she watched me eat and I watched her eat.  Our server came by and was shocked at what happened.  We didn't ask for any consideration but no service recovery was offered.  I just thought it was really bad form to bring my food out and then tell my friend she wasn't getting hers.  I am told that this little girl was just promoted to manager from a position as server.  I spoke to another restaurant manager during my stay in Las Vegas and I recounted this experience.  She responded that it was wrong on all levels.  Grand Lux, you may want to offer some training when you promote people.  I'll be back because I like the food but I'm sorely disappointed here.",

I had two simple orders. 1 Chicken sandwich (bun), 1 Chicken flat bread sandwich. Both orders came with fries. As I was told the wait would be 20 minutes, I ventured back out into the Casino and signed up for Palazzo's Players Card. I came back in 15 minutes on the dot to ensure I'd be receiving my food nice and hot (or so I thought).   My flat bread sandwich was pretty good. It had nice flavor and a generous size. I was told the other sandwich was good, however the fries for both were not only cold, but chewy and dry. Whether they typically don't take much consideration for take out orders, or because their organization in the kitchen needs work: I'm not certain because I've only eaten here this one time. For such a basic order, I can't see myself rating them any higher. I might eat there again one day because of convenience, but if that experience doesn't turn out better, you can bet this place will never get my money again. Plenty of other options in Vegas.",

    "text": "Here's an interesting fact:  Grand Lux Cafe is owned by The Cheesecake Factory!  This makes sense as the menu is very expansive and they have a large dessert case in the quick serve station up front.  The food quality here is very good, I had chicken lettuce wraps and a side salad, both which were very good!  Prices are a little more expensive than Cheesecake Factory, which is understandable considering its resort location.  I can't say I'd go out of my way to come here (hence no 5 star) but it is a very plausible option on the north end of the strip.  Careful though, a lot of times there is a wait here.",

We tried to take them out while we're eating, but it's too much. Then we stopped and let the server know about that. They sent someone to talk with us before they took it out from my check. The first thing this guy question us is if we know the lettuce. ( of course! We knew the lettuce and we also know fresh and spoil vegetable). Next, I started my burger. I cut and eat my burger. I suddenly saw the blue green chemical stain on my plate where I just cut my first bite. I stopped again and asked for the check. We didn't say anything until we paid. Then I told the server about the chemical stain. I felt very pissed this time when he reply me. \"I think it might be the dishwasher chemical\", he said. He doesn't seem sorry or any thing about my food was sit on the chemical and I ate it. In my opinion, i own 4 restaurant in town.  I don't think the dishwasher wouldn't leave the stain like that. I think it might be some cleaning product or something when they spray nearby the plate because my lip and my cheek feel numb right away while i's driving back home. In short, this cafe wouldn't be my favorite restaurant anymore.",

I am happy to report I would go back to Grand Lux Cafe which can best be described like a CheeseCake Factory. With a large menu containing a variety of items you are sure to find something to eat.  I went with a bachelorette party of 12 and all 12 items coming out of the kitchen looked really yummy. From their pizzas, to the pastas to the Asian Chicken Salad I had, I heard nothing but good remarks from all the girls. The portions were huge and the girls had a lot of food to take back to the room but it turned out perfect after a night of clubbing! I really enjoyed the cocktails too. My carmel apple martini was devine and just perfect tasting. Good eats, good pricing and good service!",

For breakfast they offer a breakfast buffet, which is a pretty good deal and they food is good too.  I went here again for some late night grub and their pasta dishes were really good.

They added new things such as a menu based on portions and I ordered the salmon picotta.  It was one of the best tasting dishes I had while I was in Vegas.  This is really a 4.5 review but only because I wish they had something more for the birthday dessert.  It was a delectable flaky snack, but a kind of cake would have been nice.

I didn't eat in the main restaurant. We picked up an order to-go since we were just upstairs and did not feel like getting dressed for dinner then having to change to go out. We ordered a pizza (tried to order Hawaiian but they were out of ingredients for a Hawaiian..WHAT? Who runs out of that stuff on a SATURDAY?) and pasta. We thought it'd be enough for 5 girls. It sort of was not...so order more! Pizzas aren't giant and round. They're oval and not enough for my canyon of an appetite. Anyway, they said it'd be ready in about 20 minutes. I went downstairs after 25 to, you know, play it safe. WRONG. I waited another 30-40 minutes after I paid for our order before actually getting it. There were people waiting ahead of me too so they were probably waiting even longer!  The food wasn't awful or anything. I think I was severely put off by the fact that I sat there waiting for an eternity when they told us 20 minutes. The food is okay, not SUPER pricey, but I felt a little underwhelmed with the non-giant pizza. (I'm just greedy.)   It definitely is convenient if you're staying in the hotel and want take out though. I'll give them some credit there. Next time, I'll probably order elsewhere unless they can guarantee their pick up times.",

They give a lot for a good price.  The bread that they give you is warm and soft from the moment you get it from the basket.  it's not the typical french bread.  It's like a wheat bread with a sweet taste.  I constantly would ask them, \"more bread, please.\"  Definitely need to try the New Orleans beignet, the sweet and puffy pastry with some powdered sugar.  Along with it, they give you three sauces to dip: chocolate, raspberry, and jack daniel sauce.  The service and atmosphere is very nice.  Our waitress was attentive.  There are two Grand Lux Cafe, one in Venetian and one in Palazzo.  Only the one in Palazzo has the New Orleans beignet.",

It was my first time but my friends swore by it. So I try the waffle and oh my God it comes out its golden brown right amount of crunch on the outside but clean and moist on the inside. We sprinkled some pecans on the top with some maple butter syrup it was like a desserts. Although it was very delicious I felt the texture to be a little weird in the mouth. But it did not take away from how absolutely delicious is was. So the pair with his waffle we had the battered shrimp it was okay it was more Brady earlier than I would have expected it to be but nonetheless it was delicious. Now my friends waffle came with chicken strips which were delicious however the skin kept falling off of the meat but it also did not take away from how delicious it was minus the fact that it could have used a little more seasoning. Now what I recommended absolutely. Now what I drive another four hours to get here and no. Whichever you decide I hope you will enjoy the chicken and waffles at the Grand Lux or the shrimp have a blessed day.",

They have a very extensive menu with something for everyone (but not nearly as overwhelming as the Cheesecake Factory), the service is always solid, the quality of the dishes are good and the portion sizes are hearty. They also offer free bread, which is amazing, so that's a plus.  The restaurant itself offers a slightly more intimate vibe as it is dimly lit and if you're sitting towards the back you totally forget about the chaos of the casino outside.   Some of our favorites include both the salmon piccata entree, zen noodle soup, the chicken lettuce wrap appetizer, and the chicken madeira although I doubt you can go wrong with anything on the menu.",

I was told that this is a sister company to them but they don't have the Cheesecake although outside of the restaurant I seen a place connected which sold pastry and other desserts. Anywho!  We arrived for breakfast about 8:30 a.m. and walked right in but a hour later there was a line. I'm not a breakfast food person but I did get hash browns, bagel, cream cheese, chicken sausage and a coconut pineapple cream spritz. Everything was excellent! When we returned for lunch another day there was a 5 minute wait and our waitress tried to put us at the tiniest 2 seater table in the restaurant which was located between 2 families where we would be bumped by people squeezing around us. I immediately told her to find us a booth. She stated we would have to return to the hostess station to be reseated. Another 5 minute wait... No biggie but I could tell the hostess was agitated by my request because when she did seat us at a booth she just put the menu's on the table and walked away. Soon after a waiter came and I ordered the bbq wood planked salmon with mashed potatoes and fried Brussel sprouts... This was a amazing meal... I stuffed myself. The best bbq salmon I have ever had! I will always come back and order that dish when I am in Las Vegas. I had a 5 star meal and great service but the hostess needs a customer service attitude adjustment.",

    "text": "This is a happy medium of the highest order. The breakfast food, from bacon to omelette to waffles to pancakes, to orange juice, is outstanding.  The service:  always perfect.  Surprisingly, the pricing is 20% less than its competitors, places such as the garden terrace at the Wynn, cafes at the Paris and Bellagio, and most notably, Bouchon at the Venetian.    The strawberry waffle with whipped cream at the grand luxe coupled with the truly hand squeezed orange juice, were every bit as good, if not more pleasing, than the equivalent items during my last several visits to Bouchon.  The orange juice is $7.  So, I'd abstain from that next time.  Las Vegas offers 2 breakfast categories:  off strip \"down home\" diners and elite, casino eateries.  The former are generally heavy, semi-unpleasant truck stop sorts of experiences.  The strip ones, both at the Wynn, Cosmo, Paris, Bellagio, etc., are outstanding, but grossly overpriced.  I cease enjoying my vacation when I have to spend $35 for a basic breakfast.  No thanks.    The last 4 trips of mine to Bouchon were met with arrogant staff, good, but not extraordinary food, and ridiculous pricing, each time getting my order screwed up.  The pomp is so pervasive there that I decided to forever boycott the place. You get tired of apologizing for your clothes, ball cap, or small luggage items brought.  You grow weary of begging the host/ess for a table near the windows.  Once seated, you're perched on this odd velour pad that's sliding all over the place and inches away from other hip cool elite diners.  No privacy. No thanks.  As for me, I'll continue coming to the Grand Lux.",

    "text": "How many appetizers can fit on one table? We aimed to find out. Between the three of us we ordered:  Grand Calamari Potato Spring Rolls Pastrami Reuben Eggrolls Short Rib Tacos Buffalo Chicken Rolls  We tried ordering the Duck Triangles, but they were out. Too bad. They sounded really good.  I probably won't order the Grand Calamari again. It wasn't bad, but there is so much more that is scrumptious to say the least. This is Cheesecake Factory's cousin and there are some cross over entrees, but most of the food is different, but somehow familiar if you are a Cheesecake Factory devotee.   My favorite by far were the short rib tacos. Very flavorful and I love the tortilla which seemed to be homemade. They weren't thin little floppy things. Second place were the Pastrami Reuben Rolls. So good!!! I love that they used pastrami rather than corned beef. Pastrami has a deeper flavor that was needed. The Buffalo Chicken Rolls are better here than at Cheesecake -- less breading/shell and more chicken filling.  As if we didn't punish ourselves enough, we ordered two entrees. The ginger beef is tender and tasty. It's even better as a leftover. Normally there wouldn't be leftovers, but seriously. There is no way we could have eaten it all. The other entree was the Cafe Beef Wellington. I liked the dish, but since it isn't the traditional beef Wellington, why not experiment with different, more flavorful cuts of meat?   And for dessert ... we are such pigs ... we couldn't make up our minds so we got the butter cake and the apple pie/tart. Get them both, even if it kills you.",

This is an absolute excellent place in the Venetian that's open late (maybe even 24 hours) and has an expansive menu that's got something for everyone. The food is pretty high quality and fairly priced.   We're always seated quickly and served immediately. The service is always friendly and cordial.   Tonight, we came here after a horrible experience at Homestead Steakhouse at Ceaser's (don't go there if you want steak, ever) and we were satisfied, just as we were the past two visits.   I'm on a no-carb diet and they were accommodating every time. I ordered a burger with no bun and they even wrapped it in lettuce for me! Same with the chicken sandwich, which was phenomenal. Plus, they've got a great happy hour menu!   At the Grand Lux, you get pretty damn good food at a low price. With all the places to eat in Vegas, it's gotta say *something* that we've eaten at least three meals here.",

    "text": "First off, our stay at the Palazzo was excellent.  I've left a separate review for the hotel itself.  We dined here because it was so conveniently located for hotel guests.  It's basically right around the corner from the guest elevators.  But since it's off the beaten path from everything else, it's not as busy as the Venetian location.  We took quite a while to pick out what we wanted and place our orders.  A few minutes later, we were informed that they did not have the baked rigatoni that my wife ordered.  Sigh; fine.  In the end, she went with the beef wellington.  Since she's pregnant, she sadly decided to order it cooked medium (hey, better safe than sorry!).  Unfortunately, when she cut open the meat, we realized it was practically rare.  Now I understand we're being a bit paranoid as any bacteria would be on the outside of the meat, and as long as the outside is cooked, it should be safe.  But c'mon, we even made a big deal about asking for it medium and the waitress got the message loud and clear that it was because of the pregnancy.  And then you just sear it?  So on top of not having her first choice, this blunder exacerbated the poor experience.  Not being in the mood to wait any longer, we asked that the beef wellington simply be returned and removed from our check.  My wife did order a fruit bowl to go.  A manager came by and apologized on behalf of the restaurant and said he'd make sure the chef got the message.  I wasn't necessarily expecting the fruit bowl to be comped, which is good because it wasn't.",

Seriously, that is the only thing that salvaged this potentially 0-star review.   The Crispy Calamari & Rock Shrimp were very chewy and tasted undercooked. I could literally taste the batter and immediately sent it back.   Entrees: I ordered the Korean Fried Chicken \"Burrito\" which was the epitome of lackluster and bland. And to top it off, the only side pairings for this dish was the choice of a house side salad or fries; not complimenting at all for an Asian-inspired dish.  My boyfriend ordered the Bourbon Street Chicken which turned out to be BUTTER fried chicken topped with mashed potatoes. He immediately ran to the bathroom to regurgitate just a few bites of it because of the ridiculously high butter content of this dish.   To make matters worse, the manager never even made it a point to visit the table to offer an apology or even \"check in\" with us are having sent TWO items away.   Definitely our biggest let-down of a dining experience in our 6 days here.... And we even had to ASK for bread halfway through our meal because none was ever brought out to us.  Moral of the story, looks can be deceiving. (See pics)",

I ate here twice while staying at Palazzo in early March -- breakfast and a late lunch. There are a few zones to this huge restaurant, a \"terrace\" that is on the casino floor, a bar area, a main dining room with buffet. Mostly booths for seating options.  For breakfast I wanted something light...so naturally I ordered biscuits and gravy. The portion was massive with two biscuits, two eggs, breakfast potatoes and lots of sausage gravy. The biscuits were a little dry, but the gravy was good. Fresh squeezed OJ and decent coffee. Mom got a traditional egg/bacon breakfast that she thought was decent. Similarly huge portion.  Lunch was equally decent. We both had sandwiches. I had a tasty Reuben. With some crispy yummy fries. Don't know if it was that I really needed to eat but that combo hit the spot. Again, massive portion sizes.   It's not a restaurant that I'd seek out, but it's definitely a more quality option than most of the strip's standard buffet or cafe offerings.",

They stated that Grand Lux is owned by the same company as The Cheesecake Factory, so it's essentially the same.   My friends and I ordered takeout on a Saturday night on a holiday weekend. They have a separate little space for takeout orders and pickups. I ordered the chicken pot pie for dinner. Our group order took about half an hour, which wasn't too bad considering we had six or seven orders. Since my chicken pot pie was a to go order, it was essentially deconstructed, with the contents of the pie, the crust, and the bread separate. The portions are huge and way more than what one person can consume in one seating. The taste of the pot pie content was very distinct, almost like how cream of mushroom or Alfredo tastes from the jar. It was decent to me because I was hungry, but embarrassing to say I still prefer Marie Callender's chicken pot pie over Grand Lux Cafe. My friends ordered a variety of items and my one friend who ordered the kale avocado salad liked the portion as well as the taste.   Overall, it seemed like Grand Lux Cafe was just OK. If it is the only option, I wouldn't dread having it again. However, I probably wouldn't seek it out.",

My cousin ordered the rib eye and her husband ordered salmon three ways.  And for dessert we ordered a few to share, New Orleans beignets (one order came with 6 or 8 pieces), warm rustic apple pie and warm butter cake. They were all so good.  The reason for the four star was that their floor is always slippery. I don't know if it's oil on the floor but definitely not water. This is on both locations inside Palazzo & Venetian.",

I know its only a molten chocolate cake, but damn this was one extra tasty molten chocolate cake.  It took them about 20 minutes to finally come out with it. Which was a good sign that they did not just heat up a pre made one.  It was so warm and a bit crispy served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Your taste buds will moonwalk with joy.  As far as dessert goes, this place did not disappoint.",

This is definitely one of my favorite places to eat now since the service, location, decor, and food is so bomb. The waiter and waitress helped us out alot by giving recommendations, making sure we were good on drinks, and getting our orders right, ahha. Didn't give us bread though! But it's okay, can't be too picky.  Got the Chicken Jambalaya with the jalapeno Cheese cornbread on the side. SO GOOD. Chicken was juicy, rice was well cooked, and the sauce was so bomb, the cornbread was super good too! props on presentation in a tiny skillet. I definitely recommend this dish.   Seriously an overlooked place to eat, I'm all about it. I think they also have Sunday buffet. Maybe next time!",

I was very impressed with how pretty this Grand Lux was. It didn't even feel like a Cafe at all.  I had the tomato soup with small sandwich and it was a delicious combination =) We also got their chocolate cupcake with vanilla ice cream dessert which was super delicious, but a little too heavy to have at night.  Prices are right and ambiance is high-end - wouldn't give it a second thought to come here again while in Vegas!",

It's also humongo inside too.  I got the shrimp scampi, and those shrimpies were HUUUGE!! They were also breaded, which I didn't like too much, but after removing the breading, it was quite tasty. My friend got the short rib grilled cheese, and OMG soooooooo good!! I want to go back to Grand Lux just so I can order that. Their bread is the best too, I seem to fill up on that alone. FOr dessert, we shared their creme brulee duo and nutty chocolate caramel cake thing. I think I may have come close to getting a cavity, because they were soooo sweet. So sweet in fact, that I only had a few bites of each. They were delish though!!",

Food selections and ambiance match that of The Cheesecake Factory.    Grand Asian Chicken Salad was average.  For a chain restaurant, I prefer the salads at California Pizza Kitchen.  My husband had the Zen Noodles, which we both thought were tasty, but insufficient for a dinner serving size.    The plus side of the evening was the quick and friendly service, even with our large group.",

Their menu is just like the Cheesecake Factory. A gazillion pages to look through. Yea, maybe when I have time but it's too early and I just wanted something simple so can I get straight to the breakfast menu?   Our service was slow. I understand, it was during a time when people are checking out and getting ready to leave Vegas so they were pretty busy but most of these people were eating at the buffet, why the heck did it take 45 mins for us to get our food?!?!?!   Anyway, I order the Eggs, Hash Brown & Sausage Links thing, yea I don't remember the name. When we finally got our food the eggs were tasteless, hash browns were so salty and the sausage links were OK. Food did the job for me, considering I was hungover and just needed something in my stomach but it fell short of my expectations.   Would I go back? It's convenient because it's in the hotel but I don't know, still thing about it...",

Kiddo got the BBQ pork sliders.  It came with 3 and were really pretty good. Tangy sauce and cool cole slaw on top and perfectly priced at $6.50.   Dinner for me was the short rib grilled cheese sandwich. This too was satisfying, and the arugula was the perfect addition to the sandwich.  Service was great: efficient and quick, and I do believe I had 3 refills, none of which I actually had to ask for. That's how it should be done.  +1 for the soundtrack during our stay. I heard Maxwell, India Arie, and John Legend for starters: my own personal playlist on repeat.",

I ordered the typical breakfast... Eggs, Sausage, Hash Browns with Toast and a coffee. The was food is what you might expect... average. Not bad and not good. Just plain and ordinary. That isn't a bad thing on its own except for the fact the service is slow and prices are steep for what you are getting. Yes, I get that this is Vegas and you are going to pay Vegas prices for just about everything, but having had an awesome breakfast the previous two mornings for the same price.... you start to ask yourself why did I come here?  It isn't surprising that Grand Lux appearance wise looks nice but the food just bleh when you consider that the concept for Grand Lux came from the same person that thought up the Cheesecake Factory; yet another mediocre joint that I would rather not visit. Overall,  I think you have to pass on this place. Plenty of other places in the area where it will be worth your money. 2 stars!",

Their breakfast buffet is a pretty good deal, $16 including juice and coffee. The food for the buffet was completely average. I ordered a hot chocolate in addition to my juice and while it looked absolutely amazing it had absolutely no flavor. The worst part of the experience was the incredibly slow service that we had to endure.   Our second trip was a late night trip for something in our bellies to sop up everything we had been drinking that night. My eggs were predictable, but my husband's sandwich was so incredibly salty that he could not eat it. In addition, the saltiness combined with the copious amounts of alcohol did not make for a happy scenario the next morning.   For breakfast or brunch head to Morels. For late night eats go over to Noodles Asia in the Venetian or dare I say it...walk down the street to Denny's.",

The flat bread sandwhich came with  pepper jack cheese, lettuce, chicken, avocado, & the flat bread was doughy & soft yummy! The fries were ok but not so great & the sangria was really good & refreshing. The food came in handy because of the huge portion for late night port partying eats.  Also the last day we were there after all the damage done to our livers I ordered the lunch salad & pasta special...the salad was light & came with balsamic vinaigrette & the pasta I chose was the pasta carbonara. It came with carbonara sauce, cheese, pancetta, & peas it was soo tasty!!! It even tasted even better when I got home that day for dinner that night..for sure I will come to eat here the next time I take a Vegas trip.",

    "text": "Take away:  Great variety of food at reasonable prices; looks and feels like it's sibling, The Cheesecake Factory.  Recommendations:  The BBQ Chicken pizza is pretty good, but it really just depends on what you're in the mood for.  DETAILS:  Atmosphere: It has the familiar Cheesecake factory decor.  It's not a fancy restaurant, but for what you pay, it feels like you're going to a pretty nice looking restaurant.  Ambience is pretty relaxed and can be great for couples and a small family gathering.  The tables, linen, and dishes were all clean as well.  Service: For the several times I've been here, the service has been pretty good.  The servers have generally been pretty quick and checked in from time to time.  It does, however, feel as if they are slightly understaffed.  A few times, we needed service but couldn't find our server for over 5 minutes.  During my last visit, we had a party of 8 and our server handled our order fairly expeditiously.  She was very friendly as well.  The wait for a party of 8 was about 15 minutes, while the smaller parties (2-5) got their tables immediately (just an FYI).  Food Quality / Selection: Huge variety of food from pastas to sandwiches.  Take a look at their menu here: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.grandluxcafe.com%2Fmenu.htm&s=184b9efcf610871153473cdc25260f0ec2515d598b8954beab1ccb258eb6a489\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">grandluxcafe.com/menu.htm</a>.  The presentation is above average.  The look and feel of the plates is similar to most other full service restaurants (especially the chain ones).  The food is above average for the most part (see details below).  Pricing/Value/Convenience: Great value; above-average portions.  This place is a great place to share an entree, an appetizer, and a dessert if you want.  Dishes that we ordered: Buffalo chicken rolls (eh, wouldn't recommend it; it has a little spicyness to it though); BBQ chicken pizza (this thin crust pizza was pretty flavorful); Pasta with chicken, sun-dried tomatoes, and mushrooms (not bad, but not great); Pasta Carbonara (flavor was good, but it just wasn't creamy enough and felt a little bit dry); Artichoke dip (was a little bit dried/overcooked - a part of it was actually burnt; wasn't creamy enough also).",

The second time we came in for a brunch/latedinner thing. It was like 1130. That time it was a great deal for 15.95. They offered eggs, bacon, sausage, fruit, orange juice, omelets, waffles, danish, yogurt, cereal and many more. It was enough to get me full for a great price.",

Luckily, I stayed at the Venetian and Grand Lux was in the hotel. I've been here many times and I'm always happy with the food I get here, ESPECIALLY after a Vegas night (you guys know what I'm talking about). One of the best things about Grand Lux is that they serve breakfast at night, so anytime you're craving that omelette or hash browns late at night, this is the place to go. The food is a bit pricey (though everything in Vegas is pricey... unless you're a girl, then almost everything is free!), but the quality of the food makes up for it. They also have a lunch happy hour type menu where everything is around $10 or less, which lasts from the afternoon until dinner time. It's also good to note that the food is similar to Cheesecake Factory because the owner of Cheesecake Factory created Grand Lux as well. If you like Cheesecake Factory, or you're craving some late breakfast foods, Grand Lux is the place to go.",

    "text": "Grand Lux Cafe at the Palazzo has over 200 items on the menu, but everything tastes great and is made fresh daily. Their drinks come with mouthwatering garnishes and taste great. I have had the luxury of trying almost everything on the menu and will attempt to describe everything I have tried.  New Orleans Beignets: This is a bake-to-order dessert that is available for breakfast as well as throughout the day. The beignet is a French-style fried doughnut that is light and fluffy and comes with four sauces on the side: Jack Daniel's Creme Anglaise sauce, Raspberry sauce, Chocolate sauce, and Cinnamon Sugar.   Jamaican Pork Tenderloin: This dish comes out with two fried wonton chips looking like pig's ears to identify the dish and comes with the pork in the middle (chili-rubbed) over sweet mashed potatoes with white rice and black beans sitting over a black pepper sauce. The black pepper sauce is the only thing spicy in the dish, although not too spicy for my taste. Bring on the spicy!  Pasta Telephono: Penne with melted cheese that creates a telephone cord (who has landline phones with curly cords these days?) when you pick it up with a fork, yum!  Sunday Night Pasta: Short rib, chunks of beef, and ground beef go into the mix of spaghettini. Although surely inspired by leftovers, this dish doesn't taste like leftovers at all. It is truly yummy and especially when it came out piping hot! It is served all nights of the week.  Roasted Beet and Goat Cheese Salad: This dish has pistacchios in it but I love it for that and the goat cheese as well. The beets are seasonally different in colors, so they may come purple or yellow. It's served with a hazelnut-citrus vinaigrette.  Belgian Waffle: The waffle comes sprinkled with powdered sugar and hot maple syrup on the side. It's simple and delicious, almost purist.  Express Breakfast Bar: A selection of yogurt, granola, wheat or white bread (there's a toaster for people to toast their own bread), English Muffin, or Bagels (ask for the cream cheese, it's not at the bar...boo), fresh fruit, a made-to-order omelette bar, bacon, scrambled eggs (probably made from powder), hashbrowns, and some small breakfast pastries like scones/croissants/cheese danishes/streuseled pastries. It includes juices and coffee and some other drinks, possibly milk and fountain drinks.  Hot Chocolate: Probably the BEST hot chocolate I have ever had in my life, with no sediments, made with whipped foam on top and some rich whipped cream and a swirl of hot chocolate, but the drink is not too sweet and not too bland.   Wild Mushroom Burger: Not a burger with mushrooms as I first thought, but a patty made of mushrooms and tasting so good that I almost would turn vegetarian (almost!). Sesame seeds come on the bun and there's a side of bibb lettuce, tomatoes, and onions with an avocado cream sauce, or was it basil aioli? Anyway, it was good!  Vietnamese Chicken Summer Rolls: eight pieces comes with Thai BBQ sauce and Peanut sauce with the chicken, slivers of carrots and lettuce throughout the summer roll (rice flour wrap) and ready to be dipped! I would ask for some hot sauce, but that's just me.  Island Cooler: non-alcoholic, made with pineapple, mango, and some other juice, tastes really yummy and comes with an edible garnish of strawberry, pineapple, and lime.   WARNING: PORTIONS ARE GARGANTUAN!~ SHARE SHARE SHARE!  I gave this place a five because I feel that it is a very caring place with the servers not upselling anything and being honest about portion sizes. I also think that the atmosphere is very grand but still casual and the food is of great value. You get more than what you paid for.",

    "text": "I love this place, I always go here when I go to Vegas.  The restaurant is like Cheesecake Factory, but better.  It's not as pricey as the other ridiculous stores in Vegas, either.  It's open late/early too, which makes it a perfect place to grub after the clubs.  I've never had to wait too long, especially since it's massive inside.  But out of all the buffets (though I'm not much of a buffet girl) and random eateries, I'd have to say this is my favorite.  What do I recommend?  Anything, really.  The pasta, pizza, salads, sandwiches...just go with a big group (which you'll probably be in when you're in Vegas, all crammed into that nice hotel) and share everything.  Family style is the way to go, after all.  The service is also always good, but that's pretty much a given in this city.  The workers are always so cheerful, from the concierge to the bartenders (well, minus the security at the clubs).  Check this place out for a reasonable price and some pretty good food.  Then go to Tao Beach after and get your tan on.",

We are fortune that we did not order items under 'large' plate.  Otherwise, we will never be able to finish them.  This is really fine dining with the prices that will not break your wallet. Both of our dishes run lower than $15. With restaurants in Las Vegas inflate the prices so much, finally there is a place you can eat and rest assured you will be able to afford the meals .",

They single handedly own some of the best (in the entire world): spaghetti carbonara, caramel chicken, cheesecake, rasberry mango smoothies, braised ribs, chicken pot pie (so i've been told by many sources).  I opted for another combo platter $21), as I always do. This time trying two new items: chicken royale (very plain and boring battered chicken pressed) and short ribs (amazingly tender, melted in my fork, an absolutely delicious dish). Topped with some of the best, softest sourdough bread, and you have yourself a great Vegas meal. I highly recommend this spot to any tourist looking for that perfect dinner under $25/30. And it's open 24 hours!",

The food quality is always good, the meals are a good size, the prices are very reasonable and the service is typically fair. The menu is HUGE so there's always something you'll find to eat and you can eat 2 meals a day at this restaurant for a week without having to get the same thing twice.  We find this to be an easy choice when in Vegas and eat there several times during every trip. We've had many large parties there (never with a reservation) and many business meetings as well as quick lunches for two, all with equal success. Their lunch pizza and salad are YUMMY!",

For the epic of all epic birthdays, I had planned a weekend in Vegas and invited 25 of my closest friends (for my 25th birthday). 2 weeks before my birthday, I called the Grand Lux and made reservations for the 25 of us knowing they'd need an early heads up. They were ok with it. 2 days before my arrival, I called to confirm my reservation with the restaurant.   Then comes the night of. I rally my 25 friends, we head to Palazzo and walk in. I go to check in and give the server my name & party size.  \"Um, we only have you down for 15\"  then they ask me my name \"Um, actually we don't have you on our reservations list at all\" (so I go from 25 to 15 to nothing!?) I then check to see if I had made the reservations at the Venetian instead. Nope.  Then I ask them to check their call logs and voila, 2 days ago they had a call w/ me and confirmed my 25 person party. In a panic, they throw together tables and split my group in 2.  No one likes splitting their group across tables on their birthday dinner. That's LAME.  The manager assures me they'll 'make it a special night for me' as it was my birthday and they had already messed up my reservation.   So, how did they make it special?  1. they neglected to bring me the BBQ sauce I asked for. 2. he then brought me 6 passes to Tao (to use with my 25 person party!?!? what!?) and he also knew we already had plans to go to Tryst and had a car arriving at 10:30 so we had requested to get our orders in as fast as possible (we had to run out the door when the car arrived).  3. my friends had requested a birthday cake for me. they brought a plate out with 2 squirts of whipped cream and a cracker that said 'have a grand day' - WHAT!?!? is this really supposed to be a dessert? (I will attach a photo when I get home) That's just insult to injury at this point - might as well not bring a dessert at all.   To say the least, this was a terrible experience for a night that had been planned 2 weeks in advance. And the food wasn't even that good.",

Relatively close to the Cheesecake Factory (& they have the same owner) and a little bit more upscale. Also, the DESSERTS! My all time favorite dessert is at the grand lux cafe! It's the molten lava cake! Now, I've tried molten lava cakes nearly everywhere and nowhere does it as good as the grand lux cafe. It's the most richest, chocolate-iest, most delicious dessert! It has soft and gooey but has a bit of a chewy crunch to the outside. They also are very generous with the fudge! It literally will lava it's way out once you take the first bite!

While the majority of our group were still sleeping, me and a couple of girl friends woke up early and experienced one of the most delicious breakfasts in Vegas.   First of all, the service was remarkable. Our waitress was very friendly and assertive in catering to us. Throughout our entire meal she was always with a smile and an upbeat attitude.   I had to start off with a mimosa. Its Vegas! For my entree I ordered the Eggs, any style, Hash Brown Potatoes with Toast. Sounds so simple and common doesn't it? But it was ridiculously amazing. Great portion size to fill me up but not to the \"food coma\" extent. The hash browns were so cute! You gotta go there and order some to understand why I'm calling fried potatoes \"cute.\" I'm not sure if it was because it was the \"morning after\" breakfast or not, but this was one of the yummiest!   We also ordered the Red Velvet cake in celebration of my friend's birthday. Red Velvet. Enough said. It was to die for. Mentioned to the waitress that it was indeed for a birthday and asked if she could put on a candle. She gave us a wink and said she's got something special for us. Out comes the cake (slice) with a special message written in powdered sugar on top of a crisp sweet cracker and a candle embedded in a swirl of whipped cream.

    "text": "Oh Grand Lux.  When will you move to the Bay Area?  Yes, it is very Cheesecake Factory-ish.  I love the variety here and the food is actually pretty darn good.  We came here for lunch after a very long crazy night.  Amongst five girls, we ordered a bunch of different items:  1. Stacked chicken quesadilla 2. Seared rare ahi 3. Asian Noodle bowl (I can't remember the exact name) 4. Tomato bisque  Do not go for the noodle!   It's a very very poor attempt at rice noodles.  I think I'm gonna give up eating noodles at non-Asian places.  I am always hugely disappointed.  The ahi and the quesadilla were good tho.  Tomato soup was a nice large bowl and tasty too.  Portions are very big so always a good idea to share because it's very unlikely you can finish it.  Prices are great.  Service is down to earth and quick.  You will definitely leave full and happy spending about $20!",

They also have a late-night menu so you can go here after partying hard at bars/clubs or gambling.  I remember trying the salmon dishes [cedar planked salmon, miso salmon] and they were both scrumptious. The bread you get before the meal is warm and fluffy, great as a free appetizer.   This place is one of the best priced restaurants in vegas and worth it because of the portions, quality, ambiance, and service you get. I always try to pay a visit here whenever I'm in vegas even if I'm not staying at Venetian/Palazzo.",

Pricing is the same as Cheesecake Factory. The lunch special is pretty well worth it. I got the sandwich special and it came with half the regular sandwich, house salad and a soup for about $10. Strawberry smoothie was delicious.   4 people came out to be about $70 including appetizers so it's not the cheapest spot to eat if you're looking for quick bite. I think our drinks (soda, smoothie and iced teas) alone came out to be about $20!",

We stayed in Vegas for 4 days, and this was by far the best meal we had!  I got the penne alla vodka, and it was delicious.  The pasta was comparable to a lot of Italian places we would go to when we lived in NYC.  The prices are very reasonable too.  I highly recommend trying this place.",

    "text": "Checked this 24/7 place out after arriving in Vegas late Friday night. Came in at about 3:30AM and was surrounded by lots of exhausted barefoot clubbers with heels in tow. From what I remember, we were seated promptly and greeted by a friendly waitress. I wanted a Long Island Iced Tea, but was instructed that \"Texas Tea\" was an ample substitute, and that it had \"spurs\". Intrigued by the spurs, and wondering if they would kick my night in the right direction, I decided to order one.  I was a little disappointed, as It tasted like sweetened Nestea with a splash of vodka and lemon.  I sent it back, and ordered a more appropriate vodka martini with 3 giant olives.  Excellent.  I also ordered the seared tuna which was excellent.  I don't really recall how much everything was, but I do remember the sun was up when we left later that \"night\".",

Menu is smaller, portions are smaller, and they managed to \"class is up\" just a notch.  Our server was annoying; like, he thought he was funny when he wasn't. (For exmaple, when I was slightly confused with the menu he asked me that I \"Stay with him\" when he was explaining it.) I guess he couldn't really help this personality trait of his, so for that I won't deduct stars for that. I mean, you can't really punish stupid people for being born the way, right?  Food was great. As other yelpers noted, the chicken and waffles is superb! Light, airy waffle and deep fried golden poultry deliciousness?! *gaahhh!*",

I love the Miso Salmon and Caramel Chicken combo.  2 nice pieces of salmon, crispy pieces of caramel chicken all atop some stir fried vegetables and  served with steamed rice.  A deal at 19.95 because 2 people can easily share it.  Their desserts are also delicious.  Their Red Velvet cake is the best ever!  My sis and I consider ourselves Red Velvet junkies.  We try that cake everywhere and the Grand Lux wins hands down.  They also serve a pretty mean Banana Cream pie and let me tell you, I can't stand bananas but I can eat this.",

    "text": "Where do I begin... I've been to grand lux so many times in my 8 years in Vegas. I prefer the newer palazzo location to the Venetian mainly because of convenience. Parking and walking from the Venetian is such a hassle, while if you know where to park at palazzo it'll take you up right by grand lux.  The restaurant is appropriately named - the decor is both grand and lux especially for what is basically a casino coffee shop. High open ceilings with lots of mirrors and other shinies, comfy seats and always very clean w great service every time.  I don't think I've ever had anything I didn't like, but I usually stick to my favs. Its hard for me to resist my sunday night pasta - its spaghetti with a meat sauce made up of a lot of different things. Meant to be like a dish where you throw all of the week's leftovers together (but made fresh) its packed with short ribs, hamburger, sausage, mushrooms and I'm sure other things I forgot about. The portion's huge, easily 2 maybe 3 meals especially if you fill up on their warm crusty bread and butter. I'm embarrassed to admit that our basket always needs a refill :) Other things worth mentioning - duck pot stickers, shrimp w pasta, short rib grilled cheese, their burger w short ribs on top. We're usually too stuffed to get dessert but I finally remembered this time to plan ahead and order the warm rustic apple pie. It's baked to order so takes 20 minutes, I'd suggest putting it in with your dinner order. Even if you forget to order ahead of time, it's well worth the wait. As you can see in the picture its really more of an apple tart. Warm flaky pastry crust, sweet but slightly tart apple slices, topped with vanilla ice cream and finished with powdered sugar. I'd go back just for that pie.  Give grand lux a try if you've never been. Their massive menu is guaranteed to have something that everyone will like.",

We waited until 11:23 to be seated... for no reason.. it was empty.   Next, we wait over 10 minutse for a waiter to stop by... any waiter at all. When the waiter finally showed up he asked \"sooo anyone stop by yet?\" \"NO\".. \"oh ok\".... how about an apology jerkoff since youve passed our table for 10 minutes now and could see we were the only table in an empty section! Geez  I ordered the chinese chicken salad. I guess it's ok if you really like rice noodles. Basically I had  a salad that was 65% edible styrofoam. YUM. not. Nothing good or redeeming about this salad.. yuck  With so many amazing places to eat in Vegas it disgusts me how many tourists waste their money at this chain crap hole.

They have a plethora of food to choose from, and they are open 24 hours, so you can get whatever you want, whenever you want it.  During this past Vegas trip, we had breakfast here twice. Their breakfast is really good. The service can be slow at times, because they do get packed, but if you aren't in a hurry, it's nice to sit and relax and enjoy your food.  The first morning I had scrambled eggs, hash browns, an english muffin and a honey vanilla latte. The portion was huge and I didn't finish all of it.  The next day I had eggs benedict florentine with my honey vanilla latte, sooo good. Their hollandaise sauce is very flavorful and the portion is just right.  The food can get pricey, especially with drinks and sides of bacon and such - orange juice here is $5.50 (what a rip!!). The second morning BF got the buffet for $15, which comes with as many drinks as he wanted, so he got OJ and soda for other people at the table so we wouldn't have to pay.   Our bill averaged $65 both mornings, and that was for 3 people...so it's about $20 per person, which is a bit much for breakfast, but you're in Vegas, live a little!",

Im disappointed just because i was expecting a bit more with the restaurant based of how busy it is every time i walk by.  I figured they must be busy because they are good but apparently its just the strip foot traffic.  Management just gave me a disgusted look when i informed them that our food came out cold and was not good when it came out. I left more then half my plate and he acted like  we were trying to get out of our bill.  Debating on if i would ever return, I have friends that actually enjoyed this place so debatable at best.

WHY? ....drumroll....  Because they have BEIGNETS! It is the ONLY Grand Lux in Vegas to have Beignets. My bff Ame and I absolutely love them here.   It's a generous serving with about 8-9 beignets and three sauces: Raspberry, chocolate, and creme fraiche.   Ame and I always end up mixing the raspberry with the creme fraiche each time. I recommend you do the same. It will change your life.   As for their regular food, everything here is average to delicious, so you really can't go wrong.   Their salads are divine, as these are SERIOUS salads with great combos of ingredients. I particularly recommend the Asian Chicken Salad and Polynesian salad (the jicama and macadamia nuts with mango..yum).   Chicken Lettuce Wraps are yummy as well, and their volcano shrimp is delicious.   Over the years it seems like they've changed the coating to their Grand Fried Calamari.. it used to be rock shrimp, zuccini, and onions fried in a thin coating of batter, but now the coating is a lot thicker and more tempuralike. Ame and I are not fans of the new formulation. Still tasty, but not the same.   Love the place for a quick bite. Service is always fantastic 100% of the time. Ame and I typically come here to catch up on girl time, and the servers are always gracious to keep pouring us water and refilling my tea/coffee when they don't have to (we always take care of them, of course for their kindness :). Seriously - they're always the nicest servers I've seen in town.   Prices may seem a dollar or two higher than your average diner, but this isn't your average diner, and plus it's at the Palazzo. Duh.   Come. Get the Beignets. Be happy. And mix the creme fraiche and raspberry sauces.",

It had a great balance of sweet and savory as well as the combination of the meats and the sun-dried cherries and apricots.   My wife's Sunday Night pasta was amazing! The meat sauce was very meaty and combined well with the mushrooms, onions and garlic. It was very tasty and all served over a huge portion of spaghettini!

    "text": "Our place of choice whether it was for early breakfast, (gotta get those hashbrowns before it turned 11AM) or smoothies any time of day or a post-club steak & eggs and zen noodles, Grand Lux Cafe has it all.   It was also conveniently located near the elevators to the rooms.   The prices, though initially may seem high for a Cheesecake Factory offshoot, are matched by the sizes of their entrees. I ordered a $14 omelette and could barely finish half of the omelette (and I can eat a healthy amount).    There is a buffet option for breakfast, there is a separate bar space, a takeout side spot, a more high end and quieter separated dining space as well as the general dining area.   I definitely recommend the hash browns (go big like me and order a double order of hash browns!), the smoothies (they taste extremely fresh and it is a big portion - halfway to a Fat Tuesday) and the steak & eggs.   Grand Lux Cafe definitely knows how to cater to the variety of Vegas-goers!   Will be back when I'm back!",

Everything is very reasonably priced as the portions are HUGE. And so good!  I had the chicken royal and it was fantastic. Well seasoned and tender. Everyone else at the table, who got everything from the pot roast to the club sandwich, raved about their food. And the total was about $240 for nine people, with 3 appetizers and shared salads. Our server-- I don't remember her name, I think it was Kiko or something like that??-- was absolutely delightful. All in all, a definite must try! I can't recommend it enough.",

All were amazing except the avocado burger - it came well done when I ordered medium rare and they forgot the avocado .

Hubby had fried shrimp which when they came looked like a huge amount until we found that under the shrimp,was bread so it looked like more.  Still he said it had good flavor. When we've been there before I had the house made veggie burger which I'd have again, it was better than the soup",

Though I must say, the ingredients were very fresh and it showed.   Today service seemed to be lacking. Our waitress was nice but brief and appeared to be in a hurry. She clearly seemed overwhelmed by all the tables. She never had the time to ask is if we needed anything. We asked for a condiment but it never came (had I waited for it to arrive, in order to eat, I would've gotten hangry).   Either way give this place a try.

They have a breakfast buffet that our waiter encouraged us to look at before ordering. They have many options including eggs, bacon, waffles, fruit etc. ultimately we decided to order off of the menu instead. My husband wanted the French toast but they were sold out. I didn't know that was possible!! He opted for the peanut butter pancakes instead. I ordered the chicken and waffles. It took probably 20-25 for our food to come out. I was impressed with the portion size! The pancakes had 3 big ones on it. The waffles was average size with probably 5 chicken strips. The chicken was very crisp but still juicy inside! The syrup had a True maple flavoring to it. I ordered some orange juice as well and loved the freshness to the taste. Not giving 5 stars due to the extremely high price!",

The server (Amanda) was friendly, helpful and upbeat. We decided to get one breakfast buffet and one from the menu. Love their coffee and the fresh squeezed juice and the food was delicious. Unfortunately, when I went to the buffet area, I could not find a piece of chicken to go with my waffles. I got the omelets instead. We really enjoyed the food and service and looking forward next time.",

This is the second time I come to the Grand Lux Cafe inside the Palazzo and once again their service is amazing! My manager recommended this place and now it's a MUST when we're in town lol. We always order the lemon chicken picatta because it is so delicious. I'm not a fan of chicken but this dish is WOW. We also ordered the Filet Mingon with loaded potatoes and French fries OMG! To die for! The steak is so tender and their ranch is AMAZING! My boyfriend got their pot roast with broccoli and he also loved it. If you're in town make sure you come here, again INSIDE THE PALAZZO (grand canal shoppes) NOT THE VENETIAN. ENJOY :D",

So we had a late show tonight and we took a nap before and ended up sleeping late and not having enough time to have dinner before the show.  We come back to the Palazzo where we're staying for our honeymoon and we walk to this place. The hostess takes us to the outside area and seats us there. Right next to us was a big table with very loud people so we go back inside and ask if we can sit in the bar area instead.  Very rudely the hostess says we have to wait for a table even though half the tables were empty! She was very rude and obnoxious. When we pointed to the empty tables she said we still have to wait as she can't seat us there. We ended up leaving and trying to find another open restaurant at this late hour. We didn't. So it's almost midnight. We haven't haven't had any food since breakfast and we have to wait till tomorrow to get something to eat. My husband is diabetic and can't go without food that long.  If you make it to this place watch for this unprofessional rude hostess.",

While the food was good, I can't say the same for the service.  It took 3 phone calls for someone to take my order.  Then after standing in line to pick up my order in the bakery, the person behind me was helped first, even though I politely said I was next.  I'm not one to be rude to servers, but neither will I accept poor business practices.  Grand Lux, you just lost a customer.",

On the bill - $10.50, about what I would have expected, but the drink itself was quite a let down.    Next time I would stick with beer or wine since that is harder to mess up.",

You wouldn't even be able to tell they were a chain until you looked at the take out bag and realized it looked eerily familiar to the Cheesecake Factory's design ... oh hey, that's their parent chain.   Food? Right on and HUGE portions.   - Their salad & lunch pasta deal is perfect for a big helping of delicious pasta and a nice small side salad. -  Even their non-alcoholic drinks are delicious, I got some berry fizz thing blended with 3 kinds of berries and mixed with Sprite and soda. It came to my table flaunting itself like a giant blended tropical drink with skewers of strawberries and pineapple.  - Asian wonton nachos were decadent but I could only stomach one or two. Deep fried pieces of wonton are smothered with chicken, peanut sauce and wasabi drizzle. Intenseeee.   Shout out to our lovely waiter (can't remember his name anymore) but after politely asking why we were in Vegas for the weekend, he came back with two birthday plates of a simple but elegant dessert. Big birthday \"cards\" of crispy sweet phyllo dough were presented to us with a dash of whipped cream and sprinkles complete with a lit candle. Absolutely unexpected, especially in the middle of the day and he really made us feel special for being there!   Thanks for having a great selection of food and such wonderful service, especially for a chain restaurant.",

The Grand Lux is conveniently located near the base of the hotel room elevators and is almost never crowded. The portions are huge, the prices are decent and the menu is extensive. After a couple of visits, however, you tend to get sick of the food because its so heavy and rich.   Visit before 3:00 p.m. to take advantage of their lunch prices and portions, which are about half the size of their regular portions but still pretty big!   Three and a half stars.",

This place was perfect since I was staying at the Palazzo. I got a breakfast brioche sandwich that came with some potato grits. It was huge and delicious! I even  had trouble finishing the sandwich. I highly recommend this sandwich, its only $11.   The second time here was on Sunday like around 5am. After a long night of club hopping and partying we had to make a stop here. My friends and I were all starving and some of us were even drunk. This time I ordered the DeLux Drive-In Burger, it came with an order of fries. The burger was tasty and the fries were good. The place was full around this time, I guess its a popular place after being up all night in Vegas. We even started talking to some girls that were sitting next to us... haha!   I highly recommend this place for either breakfast or lunch. It is very affordable and you feel like you're dining at a super expensive restaurant. I still need to go back to try their dinner plates. I will be back!!",

I had the Grand Lux Burger Melt, which came in parmesan crusted bread (not a burger bun I should add, it was like Ciabatta bread) with a sauce, and fries on the side-- DELICIOUS! One of the best burgers I've had though I would probably call it more of a sandwich since it was not a burger bun. You also get free soda refills which is awesome.   Since it was my Birthday-- and they knew this because we were all wearing ridiculously awesome Carnaval masks at the table and they asked us the occasion-- they brought out a Birthday desert which was basically whipped cream and a cookie of sorts with a candle.   I should say that serve wasn't always on point, we had to ask a couple of times for refills, and for a place setting. But well priced and good atmosphere.",

When we walked into the restaurant, I was pretty tipsy, bordering on drunk, but by the time our food came, I was stone cold sober. And I even had a drink while I was waiting for my food.

Some of the yummy highlights: Mongolian Steak, Spicy Chicken Flatbread Sandwich, Shrimp Scampi, and the Beignets. Not a huge fan of the Shaking Beef (I don't like cilantro) or the Chicken Pot Pie (looks better than it tastes - too watery). Service can be a little slow, as it is usually pretty busy.",

    "text": "My husband and I heard this restaurant was the Cheesecake Factory's sister restaurant, which is one of our favorite places to eat, and were very excited to eat here. Boy was our thinking way off from the truth! We sat down in the bar area and our booth was right next to a glass wall. You are sitting on the other side of other diners and it was very uncomfortable having them stare at your food and you while you ate. Of course it was hard for us to not look and stare as well. The set up was very poor. We both decided to order the same meal, the lunch portion of pasta telephono and salad. Everyone around us received fresh bread (as we saw everyone next to us through the glass wall) I guess our waitress decided we didn't need it. Our salads arrived and i got the house salad with ranch, which was pretty good. My husband order the caesar salad. It came with whole leaves and spicy caesar dressing, so spicy my husband couldn't even eat it. And who wants to cut their salad with a knife and fork? When we got our pasta it was completely dried out on the top and the pasta sauce was runny. The noodles wouldn't even hold the pasta sauce. In the middle of my husband eating, he immediately said he didn't feel well, went to the bathroom and got sick. For the rest of the day he was so sick to his stomach! This place is awful and the food is really poor quality. If you're looking for an extensive and creative menu you might as well hit the real thing and go to the Cheesecake Factory.",

    "text": "I've enjoyed the food and service at  the Venetian's Grand Lux and expected the same experience at this one in the Palazzo.  Our group of 8 people decided a good meal was in order to start the New Years festivities.  Unfortunately this place could only provide a lousy meal with service to match.  The beer that I ordered tasted bad and when I mentioned it to our server, he informed me that the glasses aren't always rinsed as well as they should be.  When my daughter informed him that her sirloin was inedible, the server told her she should have ordered the filet.  The beer was removed from the bill but the steak wasn't.  Some in our group commented they remember receiving better food and service at their high school cafeteria.  The experience was so bad I thought it should be brought to the attention of the Palazzo's management and contacted the front desk.  I was informed that a manager could be summoned but the answer would be the same; as the GLC was a tennant, complaints will be referred to the cafe's manager.  When he called a short time later, an apology was offered along with a gift certificate to be mailed.  My companions questioned the logic; after what had happened we were to receive a lure to return?  Well, it's now 25 days later and nothing has been received.  I've spoken with others about the incident and have heard similar stories; the GLC at the Venetian is great, the one at the Palazzo....not so much.  One person went shortly after it opened and thought it just needed to iron out the kinks -- and then realized at his next visit a year later that they still didn't have it right.",

The sandwich was probably the tastiest of the bunch.  I thought both salads were really doused with dressing which made them soggy and inedible. My fried chicken with waffles was basically a pile of chicken tenders on a dry belgian waffle--Roscoe's does a better job, albeit with much less ambiance.  We pre-ordered the beignets with 3 dipping sauces because the waiter said it would take at least 20 mins to prepare. They arrived as soft, airy, puffy balls of pastry. While they were not half-bad, that these were not even trying to be the real thing.  All in all, decent place to take a group because the menu's got something for everyone.",

Our server was very friendly and attentive.  When she gave us our menus, I almost passed out- holy cats!  There were almost as many items on the menu as The Cheesecake Factory- no joke!!!! I'm thinking to myself- how can this little restaurant possibly do all of these items right?  I mean, there were so many, and they were so varied!  Salads, pasta dishes, soups, seafood, meats, vegetarian and vegan dishes....the list was overwhelming!  My hubs ordered a salmon dish, and since I'm not a seafood lover, and I had a not so fun night the night before, (food poisoning), so I needed to keep it safe food-wise...I ordered the carbonara  without any chicken.    We didn't wait too long, and we were having a good time listening to the two young dudes next to us trying to pick up these two beautiful women that were way out of their league- seriously, Vegas is so much fun to people watch! :)   My husband said his salmon dish was beyond amazing.  He tried to get me to try a bite, but I wasn't having that- no matter how great he said it was.  I could tell by the look on his face he was in salmon heaven.    My carbonara was ridiculous!!!!! It was THE BEST I've ever had!!!!!! The pasta was so perfect and it tasted like it was maybe cooked with garlic and cream.  The sauce was not too buttery, but just right.  Savory. Creamy. Perfect! I love bacon, but usually not chunks...but this bacon was chunky and so tasty!  No chewy fatty pieces either- just crazy flavor! :). The peas were nice as well.   I was only sad because I couldn't eat all of it, and I don't have a refrigerator in my room....so sadly I had to leave the rest.    Overall, the server was awesome and the salmon dish and carbonara was amazing.  This is a must stop.  Don't be fooled by the lack of fanciness...It will very pleasantly surprise you!",

Something persuaded me to enter the Grand Luxe Cafe.  I was not too thrilled at first because I've been to one at Beverly Center (back home in LA). It was late morning and I had left my friends at the hotel to venture off on my own. With that said I didn't need to wait in line like the rest of the folks, I got seated right away at the counter in the bar area.   My server's name was Chris (he remembered me when I visited again the second time a month later). We had a few great conversations and I even chatted with the folks who sat next to me.   I love breakfast so I opted for just plain old eggs and toast. Then I wanted orange juice.....just a little kicked up.....got myself a Clementine Crush (Clementine Orange Vodka and Cointreau Shaken with Fresh Orange, Lime, Passion Fruit and Pineapple Juice). Let me tell you, that drink was the perfect way to start my morning at Vegas. It was so freakin' good even my neighbor got the same order. Maybe it's the way Chris makes it....who knows.....but this shit is good. I was a little tipsy so had to stay a little bit longer than I expected, lol.  The service is outstanding. The atmosphere is relaxing. And the Clementine Crush is to die for. And yes I came back here again for breakfast a few months later.",

This location isn't 24 hrs. For that you'll have to walk across the casino floor through the corridor of shops and restaurants and make your way to the Venetian. There you will find the 24 hr Grand Lux Cafe. Food and service is the same at both so it's just a matter of convenience in choosing which location to dine at.  If you're having a hard time choosing what to order out of the hundreds of menu options, I've never regretted getting their chicken pot pie. Full of comforting goodness.

    "text": "I am always in search of a good happy hour deal, and a friend has raved about the Grand Lux Cafe for years, so I when I decided to finally try it out, I was pleasantly surprised to find that they offered a happy hour--and a pretty decent one at that. But while the prices were great, the food was just OK.  Draft beers were $4 (regularly $7), and there were a myriad of appetizers for $5.50 each. Because the normal app prices are in the $9-$11 range, I thought these would be smaller portions. Nope. They were HUGE! I ordered the Asian nachos (my friend's favorite), and my husband ordered the potato spring rolls. Both items were visually appealing but sadly lacked flavor. The nachos had a tasty peanut sauce, but the fried wontons tasted a little like Styrofoam and there wasn't much chicken to speak of. And while the spring rolls were topped with cheese and crispy bacon, the mashed potato filling was pretty bland. I'll give them points for creativity, and I can't complain much at $5.50 a pop, but I wouldn't pay full price for either item.  Grand Lux has a pretty extensive full menu, so if you choose to eat in the restaurant (happy hour is at the bar only), you might have better luck. But if you're on this part of the Strip and you're looking for a great happy hour, walk a few blocks down to The Yard House at The Linq. Beer is a little more expensive, but the food is better and the view is killer!",

    "text": "This was the last of the three lunch dates that the No1DP and I had on our most recent Vegas trip. We wanted to have a meal but not have the meal overshadow what we were going to have for dinner, so we opted for classic comfort food without going to a fancy schmancy place that offered a lunch menu or a restaurant owned by a celebrity chef, which is a lot of restaurants around the Venetian/Palazzo area.  I had a feeling that the wait times were going to be long come lunch hour so around 11:45 I claimed my table for two, which took around ~5 minutes. This ended up being a good decision because when the No1DP left workshops to meet me for lunch around 12:10, the line was out the restaurant.  No1DP and I sat in a table that was so small it could barely fit ourselves and our drinks, plates and silverware much less what we ordered. As there was another pair sitting to the right of the waitstaff couldn't put any extra food there (to the left was the main walkway and kitchen area) and we wondered how they were going to manage our orders once they were ready.  No1DP had a beer while I had these morning cocktails. Strawberry Bellini ($10.95): Fresh Strawberries, Champagne and Triple Sec. The fresh strawberries were the star of this cocktail. Strawberries were still sweet enough to eat afterwards.  The Grand Mimosa ($10.95): With Mumm Napa, Grand Marnier and Fresh Orange Juice. I've had better mimosas for cheaper, balance between champagne and OJ was a bit off.  We had the following dishes a la carte. Seared Rare Ahi Tuna Salad ($16.95): romaine, radicchio, frisee and avocado tossed in vinaigrette. We were warned about how big these salads were - when the dish came out we thought the salad could serve 3! There were plenty of greens and ahi on that plate. Vinaigrette was tart and light. Ahi was lightly salted and quite soft though a little more firm than sashimi ahi.   As we were eating our salad the plates containing the two other orders were brought forth but the waiter noticed that since we had no room on our table he promptly brought the dishes back to the kitchen. As we finished the ahi the waiter passed us by without checking up on us to see if we were finished nor asked us if we would like our other entrees next. It wasn't until we prompted him about ~15 minutes later to take away our salad plate to make room for the other dishes.   New Orleans Shrimp Saute ($14.95): shrimp, tomatoes, roasted peppers and cajun spices, all simmered in a delicious tasso sauce, served with steamed white rice and grilled bread. The best dish of the three, sauce was buttery, smokey and a bit spicy. Long grained rice suited this dish well as it absorbed the sauce, as did the thin and crunchy bread.   Housemade Pierogies ($13.95): potato dumplings with slow roasted short rib, mushrooms and onion. garnished with green onion and sour cream. Both of us had pierogies before and we both agreed that this dish more resembled a gyoza than a pierogi. Pierogis can be heavy but are not supposed to be deep fried and heavy as this. As we were already stuffed by the previous dish we struggled to eat even one \"pierogi\".   Supposedly they are more known for their breakfasts so I'll have to check that out one day but I'll explore other options for lunch and dinner.",

They make one giant batch and stop serving it after breakfast.  Since I wasn't in the mood for anything else, I got a salad and soup for $10. Salad was good, the soup, Chicken Tortilla, was mediocre. The one over at CF is way better. The complimentary bread was really good though! Fluffy and soft, with really tasty butter.",

The bads: Way too greasy  So, apparently these guys are related to the Cheesecake Factory. I had an unfortunate incident on my last CF experience that I was pretty much traumatized for a few days...not really a big deal, but the food at the time was was too buttery for me to handle.  Anyways, even though I knew walking in that these guys were related to the CF, it didn't really register in my mind of my past experience so without thinking, I ordered their breakfast sandwich.  But reality came to me right away after the first bite since the bread was just soaked in butter. And I was thinking...no no not again. It was way too much butter for me to handle and I just ate everything else except the bread.  I had to wash it down with a nice frosty brew since I was sitting at the bar, it made sense for me to have a beer to get myself back to equilibrium.  They have two Grand Lux Cafes to choose from here at the Palazzo and Venetian.  Note to self: Be careful of greasy foods at the CF.",

It came with a generous helping of fries on the side.  I couldn't finish it at all, especially since it was lunchtime and I was saving my stomach for dinner at Bouchon (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/bouchon-las-vegas#hrid:IW8qqvB5DseBKXc1l1QKmw\">yelp.com/biz/bouchon-las...</a>).  The burger was loaded with lettuce, tomato, cheese, bacon, and shortrib meat.  There may have been sauce, but who knows.  There was so much flavor and juice and ohhhh yummm I'm drooling a little on my keyboard.  Sorry for the vivid description, but seriously, get this burger.  And to top it off, all of that for 14 bucks!    My mom had the lettuce wraps which were great, well seasoned with chicken and veggies and some light sauce.  The only complaint I really have is that the service was pretty slow and the waiter didn't even bring us bread until we asked for it.  I know it was really busy, but come on!  Bread is not that hard to remember, especially when every table has some except us.  Of course, the fact that it's open 24 hours is also great, especially since there is pretty limited real dining 24 hours in Vegas (ironic, right?)",

The portions are huge and we all couldnt finish all our food! I had the salmon thats prepared three different ways and I LOVED IT! We also ordered the beignets(sp?) for dessert and it was waay better than the ones at Disneyland. I highly recommend this place if you dont feel like eating at any of the other high end restaurants in Vegas. The only thing is that our server messed up on our bill by charging us twice for gratuity or something (my friend figured it out, I wasnt paying attention) and he barely came back to check on us or refill our drinks.

    "text": "Two weekends ago, we went to Las Vegas for JC's birthday. For the record, best birthday celebration ever!! We stayed at the Palazzo, so, partly out of convenience, partly out of curiosity, we did dinner at Grand Lux one night. JP got the Jamaican Pork Tenderloin, my memory tells me JC got the reuben but I can't find it on the menu, not quite remembering what JL got, KL had the Asian Nachos, BT went for the Chicken Pot Pie, and I had the Madeira Chicken. I only got around to trying JP's and BT's dishes in addition to mine. The Jamaican pork was really good. It comes with rice, mashed sweet potatoes, and mango salsa. Hearty. If there's one criticism, maybe it was a bit salty. The chicken pot pie was the biggest. pot. pie. EVER. The area of the crust was as big as both my hands together. Ok, so I have midget hands. But still! Creamy. Delish. My Madeira Chicken served with mashed potatoes and asparagus was perfect. I'm always a fan of any creamy wine sauce. Mashed potatoes equals comfort. Asparagus equals love. It's nothing super fancy, just exactly what my taste buds were asking for.  Fast forward to one day later. We had been up till 9am playing blackjack and were running on no sleep. Slightly dejected after losing a fair amount of money, but mostly needing showers, we went back up to our room to shower and get ready for checkout, then JP, JC, JC2, BT, TC, and I had our last lunch at Grand Lux. Not remembering what everyone had this time. I'll venture to say the DeLux Drive-In Burger, Grand Club, and the Santa Barbara Chicken Sandwich were among the choices. Definitely not remembering what JP got. She was too preoccupied with getting back to the blackjack tables. so JP is huddled in the corner struggling to stay awake, conflicted between her desire to take a nap and her significantly more urgent need to get back to the tables. I ordered the Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich, which was excellent. A chicken sandwich with lettuce and tomato, kicked up with pepper jack and avocado-corn salsa. I want to say it was one giant sandwich cut into quarters, but it was really four still-giant sandwiches. Before I got to my second sandwich, JP had already finished whatever she ordered, threw her credit card down on the table for us to pay with, and ran back to the casino. By herself. Addict.  In the past, I've also had the Crispy Thai Shrimp & Chicken Spring Rolls, Lemon Chicken Piccata, and Banana Cream Pie, all of which I would recommend. I've always had great service, the atmosphere is great, and it's just the kind of place you want to be. Comfortable and consistent. Unfortunately there aren't as many pictures as usual, as I was too preoccupied with my meal companion or we were too concerned with getting back to the blackjack tables, but there are a few that will hopefully suffice. In summary, it's simple, nothing absolutely crazy gourmet, but definitely hits the spot and more than satisfactory. Huge portions and so good! Yummers!!!!",

I had the pasta telefono, with a salad off the lunch portion menu, my husband has the miso glazed salmon lunch portion. Both were huge lunch portions, we left so satisfied and full. The pasta was al dente, with a homemade sauce. The combination of cheese, cream and crunchy baked crumbs were memorable and addictive. The salmon was fresh and briny, the miso glaze complimented and did not overpower the delicate fish. The salmon was served with fluffy white rice and stir fried vegetables. Yummy.  Went again, late night, I had the waffle with strawberries and my husband had the crunchy chicken. HUGE portions, very reasonably priced. The server was welcoming, offering suggestions off the menus based not on upping his check, but on his favorites. Can't wait until my next vacation to go back to this place.",

Waitress provided great service and had a great personality.  Food was excellent as usual for all Cheesecake Factory restaurants.   I had the corkscrew pasta w/sundried tomatoes and chicken and that was excellent. My husband had the Southwestern Salad which was also excellent with a lot of flavor.  My daughter's chicken picata was cooked perfectly.  We had a party of 10 and everyone left happy.  They have a lot of parking and it's close to the restaurant which is good for families like ours as we don't need to drag the kids very far to eat.",

The beignets were totally reminiscent of Cafe du Monde in New Orleans, except these ones had chocolate sauce, raspberry sauce and another one I can't recall.  It came in a basket of 8 or 10 (we ate them  so fast, we couldn't remember exactly how many).  The server was very nice and attentive.  Overall a great experience.",

The menu and offerings are slightly different, although you can still get the same cheesecake for dessert.  We shared a lunch combination of a rustic barbeque chicken pizza and green salad, ahi tuna ceviche, and the recommended chicken pot pie.  The ceviche came in generous portions and was served with crunchy strips, greens, and chips.  I would have liked it to be less salty, though.  The pizza was delicious and served on a large crisped flat crust.  We also enjoyed the chicken pot pie, with its rich and creamy sauce, tender chicken pieces, cooked vegetables, and buttery thick crust.  Be prepared to share dishes as everything comes in large servings.  With a huge menu, plenty of seating, and friendly service, this is a great spot to dine at anytime of day.",

    "text": "After an hour of walking around the Shops at Palazzo and looking at the various menus, we came back to the Grand Lux Cafe after yelping \"lava cake.\" Don't make the mistake that we first made by going to the Grand Lux at the Venetian, as they don't serve lava cake there. So once we found the right one, we ordered from their tapas page at the front of the menu, basically a variety of small plates. We tried almost everything: calamari, ahi tuna ceviche, and the short rib asian tacos, macaroni and cheese, buffalo chicken bites, mini pastrami reuben sandwiches.  And of course for dessert the lava cake. Our favorites were the ceviche and short rib tacos. The calamari and pastrami dishes were very good too. The macaroni and cheese was not good at all. In the menu it's described as creamy, but the cheese on top was rock hard. When I decided to take it home for the kids, I found all the creaminess had separated and was at the bottom of the little skillet that it's served in. Best thing about the little plates are the reasonable prices and you still have room for dessert. And you MUST save room for dessert. The lava cake here was to die for, and dare I say it, the best lava cake I've ever had! The presentation was beautiful, on a rectangular platter, the cake, scoop of vanilla ice cream, garnish of strawberries all in a row, with a sweep of chocolate ganash along the top. They have a selection of baked to order desserts, including this one, that you have to order at least 30 minutes in advance. It had a perfectly chewy, brownie like consistency on the outside and once you poked a hole in it, the piping hot ganache comes flowing out like.... lava. So perfect!  Also, they had a great service. Our server in particular was amazing. We noticed that he didn't write anything down when we ordered and we asked him about it later. He said that he's taken orders for parties of 12 and remembers everything.   So if you don't know what to eat while in Vegas, come here because they have everything and they do it really well.",

Two of their regular dishes, just a smaller version paired together to be one dish.  Service is done with a smile and a friendly attitude... and their desserts if you can get that far are cheesecakes from the infamous Cheesecake Factory...  SOOOO YUMMS...

The restaurant is inside The Venetian and is about a 10-15 minute walk from The Mirage. It's located downstairs in the casino area but secluded enough for the smoke to not interfere with your meal.   Food was delicious and reasonably priced for Las Vegas. For appetizers, we got the chicken lettuce wraps and the Asian nachos. I could have almost just ate these two dishes and called it a night because the portions are so big.  For entrees, my coworker and I both got the Salmon 3 ways and the other got the Seafood Salad. If you want your money's worth and you can't pick a Salmon, get it 3 ways. You'll thank me later and leave happy. The seafood salad looked just as intimidating because none of us were able to finish our plates and enjoyed every bite. They also have a happy hour that ends at 6:30 but you have to sit in the bar area.",

Very similar to its sister chain, Cheesecake Factory. What I like most is their consistency every time I've been here. This is definitely better than the other location at the Venetian, especially in terms of service.  I usually opt for a basic breakfast here (the two eggs any style), and for $14 you get a pretty full breakfast. The french toast is also great, and it seems like they've recently expanded their menu-- I tried the breakfast quesadilla and it was delicious!  Also, don't pass up their freshly baked cookies. They're decently priced at around $8.50 for a dozen, but they are freshly baked and take around 30 minutes after you put in your order!",

By the time he got his food he wasn't interested in food and was just tired. Yes she apologized but then brought us our check not once asking if we wanted dessert. By the way we did. We felt like they wanted us out and we felt rushed especially when they started to bus around us. O well we can go find somewhere else to take our money in exchange for sweets.

My view on red velvet foods is that they are just an excuse to eat the cream cheese frosting, but these pancakes definitely are not the case. These have redeemed the red velvet foods family! The pancakes are cooked perfectly, there are little scrumptious morsels of chocolate chips in the batter, and the cream cheese frosting complements the stack perfectly! Potentially one of the best pancakes to touch my refined palette. (Insert snooty facial expression here.)  If you want an instant cavity get the churro French toast (: I took one small bite and I felt the sugar pierce through every cell in my body. But, you know, don't let my review stop you. You do you.

    "text": "Loved this place so much, I literally ate here at every meal during my short trip to Vegas last weekend.  Of course, 25% of that reason was because it was so damn convenient and was open late night.  I honestly refused to dine here at first because it is reminiscent of the Denny's type restaurants desperate 20 somethings would go to after the clubs closed and the taco truck lines were just too long to suffer through in a dress.  However, that is not the case at all.  There is a long line for a reason and it is not because of desperation.  1st night - my gf & I scurried off to find some place to eat and more importantly sit after our bfs decided to gamble away a few hundred dollars at the poker tables.  Neither of us wanted to watch the debacle so we ended up here.  At first there was an intimidating line and we considered going with a few of our other friends to drive thru Mickey D's but 1) I had already suffered through Burger King at LAX earlier that evening and 2) we were planning to bikini it up at the pool the next day.  We were seated after about a 10-15 minute wait, not too tragic.  Once seated the wait for service and food was longer than anticipated but we managed to amuse our slightly drunk selves with conversation and people watching.  Another seemingly drunker group of girls proceeded to shout and bang their tables until a waiter came by.  I know the wait was long and it's hard to wait for bread when you feel that you're slightly past your limit but come on... you're still a lady (assuming) and there's no reason to act barbaric.  Caveman just doesn't look good in a cocktail dress.  Now the good stuff.  We ordered three appetizers to share between 2 ladies: the ahi tuna, mashed potato egg roles (whaaaaat?  Yea, I know... we thought that too but when you're intoxicated anything sounds good), and the volcano shrimp.  ALL WERE EXCELLENT.  We enjoyed ourselves immensely, happily pigging out and re hydrating for more shenanigans to come.  I have to say that I was simply happy for the moment and even had leftovers for our men who seem to have forgotten about us.  Two hours later, we got our check - happily tipped our obviously exhausted waiter, found our fellas, and went back to our respective rooms at the Venetian.",

They have a very extensive menu where  there is definitely something for everyone here. Our waiter was very helpful in helping us narrow down our choices. Wifey went with the Shortrib Grilled Cheese, and I got the Korean Sriracha Burger-Bulgogi piled high with onions and mushrooms on a beef patty(perfect medium rare like I requested) and sriracha mayo on a brioche bun. Both of these were winners!  Another suggestion by our waiter was their  made to order Beignets, and people have raved on their reviews about  this dessert, so we decided to give it a shot, planned ahead and boxed up half of our entrees to save room. The Beignets came with 8 pieces and three sauces-chocolate, raspberry, and vanilla anglaise. So wishing it was love at first bite, we couldn't get past that fryer grease aftertaste even with the sugar on top or the three sauces. Barely three pieces were eaten, and I kinda regretted not going with something else..  Will definitely be back for their savory stuff and be more careful if and when ordering a dessert.  ALOHA!!!

    "text": "We were walking around trying to find a good restaurant for dinner where we wouldn't have to wait and we came upon Grand Lux Cafe.  We had been to the other location a few days ago and we knew they had a large menu of lots of options so we decided to check this location out.  It seems bigger than the other one and it's more of a wide open space.  We were seated at a half booth, half table and would be fairly close to our neighbouring guests if there were any.  A family arrived midway in our dinner but they were too busy looking at their phones so I didn't feel like I was listening in on their conversations.  They also had large booths to accommodate groups of at least 6.  Because the menu is large, it takes a little while to go through it.  But they also provide complimentary bread to go along with the large portions.  Our server was alright and took our orders, and got us our food.  He told us about a Thanksgiving special but we weren't in the mood for turkey and pumpkin pie.  I ordered the ribs, peanut coleslaw, cornbread, and fries.  I really liked the coleslaw with the peanuts and it wasn't drenched in salad dressing.  The ribs arrived with extra sauce.  Too much food for one meal so I bought ribs home to eat the next day.  The price was reasonable too as it was less than $20.  I like the food here and wouldn't hesitate to come back next time I'm in Vegas.",

The salad itself could have been my entire meal alone. It ended up being only around $10 which is not too shabby for the strip. The flavors were great too, simple soup and salad but tasty.  I'm really happy we ventured out to this place. I highly recommend it for a lunch break or to take advantage of their happy hour!",

We came for brunch and while they have a decent spread but this is just another upscale chain restaurant.  The service was hit or miss. It started off great but once we got our food we had to keep asking to get refills, to add another order and for the bill.    I think this would have been at least a 3-4 star restaurant if I ordered something else.  Both my friend and I got the corned beef hash which we did not like.  We both had the same complaint that the meat was dry so and with a bit of potatoes mixed in.  The dish was just so off balance with the lack of potatoes.  Both of our eggs were also overcooked.  The hash browns were decent.  The best part of my meal was the OJ which for the price they charge it better be good.",

We got:  Breakfast combo (scrambled eggs, hash brown, sausage links): The eggs were aplenty, as were the sausages...the hash browns were spread very thin and not fried enough so it wasn't crispy. Actually, it was borderline chewy, and the bf did not appreciate that at all.   Sonoma Salad: I wish I had more avocado in my salad, but it wasn't bad. The chicken was very moist and seasoned very well (may be a bit salty for some of you). The corn is really fresh (none of that canned stuff!) and may have been my favorite part of the meal. Not bad at all :)  Overall they give giant portions for a good price. I think the food (the breakfast) may have been better, but then again we did go fairly late to eat. I'd come back; this is a very convenient place.",

The menu is huge featuring a wide array of salads, sandwiches, and unique entrees from a variety of cuisines. Alot of dishes (of course the desserts) are ported over from Cheesecake Factory and bumped up a little on the price.

    "text": "I STILL HAVE NIGHTMARES OF THAT GAWD AWFUL ZEN NOODLES!  Over the years, I've been to Grand Lux Cafe 8 times out of convenience; 4 times at the Venetian (open 24 hrs) and the last 4 times at the Palazzo (closes at 3 AM on weekends). The most recent visit was on Sat, 2/19/11 for brunch.  I've walked into GLC Hungover, Smashed, and Belligerently DRUNK (thank goodness for my guy friends who will yank me out so that I have some sort of dignity left). Although my other senses may be shot, when it comes to food, I still oddly have a keen sense of taste.   GLC is a sister restaurant of Cheesecake Factory. I can see the appeal of GLC; huge portions at affordable prices for the Strip. Call me a food snob, but I'm not a fan of food chains since they tend to have a \"quantity over quality\" mentality so you can take my review w/ a grain of salt.   W A I T  T I M E: Weekend Brunch: 15-20 mins w/ a longer wait for larger parties.  Dinner: Never more than 5 mins.  Since I tend to stay out till 4 AM, I've never made it to this Palazzo location since they close at 3 AM, however, the wait times at the Venetian has never been more than 5 mins.  If you get late night take-out it can take up to 45 mins.  F O O D: TIP: STAY AWAY FROM THE ASIAN ENTREES!!!  Growing up in SF, I'm fortunate to be surrounded by Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, etc restaurants so I hold a certain standard for Asian food that simply CANNOT be found on the Strip. For any taste of authenticity, a quick 8 min cab ride to Spring Mountain Road will satiate your Asian food cravings.  *ZEN NOODLES: DISGUSTING!  This is GLC's rendition of pho ga (Vietnamese chicken noodle soup) and it's poorly executed. Chopped up rice noodles are placed in a bowl and topped w/ slices of chicken breast. Upon serving, \"Swanson\" chicken broth is poured over. Bean sprouts and Italian Basil (not Thai basil as stated on the menu) are served w/ the noodles. The bean sprouts were not fresh as they were brown.  My friend's bf had ordered this dish and mind you, he EATS a lot and is ALWAYS hungry, but after one bite, he spit out the Zen Noodles and decided to sleep instead. I was curious and took one bite and it was disgusting; the noodles were mushy, the chicken dry, and the broth tasted like watered-down Swanson's broth. GLC is better off serving an instant pho bowl from the local Asian market.   *CARAMEL CHICKEN & SHAKING BEEF: MEH!  I know better than to order Asian food at American chains, however, every time I'm in Vegas, I have this weird ravenous craving for Asian food on the day we're about to leave.    The CARAMEL CHICKEN is obviously from a frozen bag as the pieces are overly battered and then slathered w/ a slimy sauce. The chicken was so heavily coated w/ the syrupy sweet sauce that it was like eating thick syrup with fried batter pieces.   As for the SHAKING BEEF, the beef was tender but was more reminiscent of eating beef fajitas (w/ the grilled onions and bell peppers) b/c it was missing the tangy and pepperiness from the lemon pepper sauce that authentic shaking beef is normally served with.  The long grain rice was too dry and a little undercooked as if it was made from a box of Microwaveable Uncle Ben's.  If you have certain standards for Asian food, STICK w/ AMERICAN CLASSICS like Pancakes, Omelets, Burgers and Sandwiches which I've never had a problem with. Nothing mind-blowing or note-worthy, just standard diner fare kicked up a notch.  I have tried the FRIED CHICKEN & WAFFLES which Yelpers have raved about but it has scarred my vision of what Fried Chicken & Waffles should be and taste like.  One would think it would be combo of sweet, savory and crisp and soft...  The belgium waffle lacked a crispy exterior and was more soggy than anything. It was topped w/ over breaded fried chicken tenders that was very bland. Unless I drenched the chicken and waffles w/ the pecan honey butter sauce, it was like eating dry fried batter (chicken) and wet cardboard (waffles).  S E R V I C E: Slow and inconsistent.  The times I've been during brunch, it took about 15-20 mins to get our food which is fair, but during late-nights it can take over 30 mins.  What grinds my gears is the service we encountered during brunch last Sat, 2/19/11. Half of us wanted to order from the breakfast menu and the other half from the lunch menu. It was 10:53 AM and we asked the waitress if we could place our orders in for the lunch menu and she said, \"No, you have to wait until 11:00 AM\". Fine, so 11:02 AM rolls by and we placed our order.   3 mins later, I see other waitresses bringing out entrees from the lunch menu so clearly they were allowed to place their orders in but we weren't. This may not be a big deal, but if you let some patrons do it, you have to be consistent and let EVERYONE do so. And when you're hungover, starving, and in need of food to absorb the copious amounts of alcohol in your stomach, every MINUTE counts!!!",

I gave their pasta a try just because my friend wanted to split it with me, and to my surprise it was delicious!  I don't know if it's the pasta itself, or the sauce on it, it's just delicious!

    "text": "I ate here the 3/3 days that I stayed in Vegas. Despite the convenience of staying at the Palazzo as well, the food and was worth coming back for more.   The calamari was my favorite! Both the mini sized ones and the larger portion one which came with an unusual yet bomb dipping sauce. Totally crispy and the breading was unlike anything I have had before. The corned beef hash, great for anytime of the day, was also good and twas a large portion! I would also hiiiiiighlyyy recommend the Asian BBQ tacos. Very tasty, enough to satisfy your hunger and is such a cute presentation. This restaurant feels classy and the decor is beautiful and pairs nicely with the delicious food.  However. I had to knock off one star for poor service etiquette! 2/3 days, I received poor service, they also seemed to hate their life because they had expressionless faces. I know you guys get busy sometimes, but a be right back or a thank you in reply would be nice.   Needless to say, I'll come back again for sure.",

    "text": "As a sister restaurant to the Cheesecake Factory, they have similar ambiance and similar food. Everything from seating to the To-go boxes and bags have similar appearance. Everything ordered was delicious. We started out with the Reuben Eggrolls which are reminiscent of the Cuban Roll from Cheesecake Factory. Light delicious and all the components of a Reuben Sandwich stuffed into an Eggroll Wrapper. I ordered the Chicken Milanese which has a lemon based cream sauce. It was delicious and a reminds me of the Crusted Chicken Romano from The Cheesecake Factory. We ended with Beignets which we ordered at the beginning of the meal so it was ready for dessert. Definitely delicious, but condensed milk would have topped off the beignets well. The chocolate and raspberry toppings were artificial tasting to me, but I am personally not fond of those flavors on a normal day. The best one was the white sauce, which I believe was a Jack Daniels creme anglaise. Dessert was a different focus with fresh baked options that can take up to 30 minutes to prepare. I would do this again!",

My boyfriend just ate the rice and left everything else. The butter lettuce in the butter lettuce salad was too bitter, but the tomatoes and topping was good. Pot roast cheese fries was ok. Pot roast meat was good, but the fries itself was salty. Overall the food was pretty bad, not worth the price! For the prices here you can get better food elsewhere!",

Can't wait to go back. Great service and wonderful food. Nice plating and clean. This is so so so so so much better the Cheese Cake Factory. So much better!  Loved all of it:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.grandluxcafe.com%2Fmenu.htm&s=184b9efcf610871153473cdc25260f0ec2515d598b8954beab1ccb258eb6a489\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">grandluxcafe.com/menu.htm</a>  Cajun Shrimp & Chicken Jambalaya  Sauteed with Peppers, Onions and Tasso in a Delicious Spicy Sauce.  Served with White Rice. Never had such soft chicken. It was so tender and the rice was cooked right. I was so surprised that this was made so well. I felt like the kitchen was really serious about their food.  Chicken Royale and Short Ribs So good. Short Ribs were amazingly tender, like moist, juicy, and meaty. It was one of the best short ribs ever. Chicken was ok.   Molten Chocolate Cake  With a Melted Chocolate Center. Served with Vanilla Ice Cream So good. What a good amount of dessert for less than $10! It was a really good dessert dish.  I felt the kitchen was really good. I think they must have a really good chef. And the waiter was super nice. I was so pleased with this meal. This is probably one of the best cafes I have tried on the Las Vegas strip. Price was reasonable and food was delicious.",

    "text": "note: this review is for the restaurant in the Palazzo  We probably never would have come here for dinner, due to the fact that they have locations in both the Venetian(24 Hr) & Palazzo. That alone, might lead you to assume that it's probably a bit on the pricey side. Actually, it's surprisingly affordable & in the $$ price range.  Gold, marble & metal finishes, amber colored glass & faint candle-like lighting accent every inch of this palatial cafe. This place is the classier (& better looking) sister restaurant to The Cheesecake Factory.  If you're indecisive when it comes to ordering, I suggest you leave ordering to someone else, 'cause the menu is an extensive 12 pages-or-so of food, drinks & desserts. There is so much stuff here, that there has definitely got to be something on the menu to \"Palazzo yo' azzo!\"  From the \"Things to Share\" (or not) menu -  Asian Nachos - A scoop of Spanish rice w/ black beans & corn, circled by 8 oversized pieces of crispy wonton style \"nacho\" chips. Topped with chicken, peanuts, sweet spicy peanut & creamy wasabi dressings. Some pieces could have gone easier on peanut sauce, though. But the other pieces - Wow! An Asian fiesta explosion in your mouth!  Crispy Thai Shrimp & Chicken Spring Rolls - Served with a bowl of fresh lettuce, shredded carrot & mint sprigs. Wrap one of the 6 crispy fried spring rolls in a lettuce leaf with carrots & mint, then dip it in the sauce. So refreshingly tasty! A definite, \"Get this!\"  Double-Cheese Mini Burgers - There is no kids menu here, so my little one got this. \"You call those mini?\" Each one of the 4 sliders are enough for 1 little one, so share, if you want to. They each come with lettuce a slice of tomato & pickle.  Crispy Ahi Sushi Roll - These were okay, not so special, but did hit the spot. Each of the 6 spicy tuna rolls are crisp tempura fried, served with Asian greens & a spicy-hot soy-chili dipping sauce.  Sunday Night Pasta (served everyday) - Tender beef short rib & steak pieces slow cooked with mushrooms, garlic & Parmesan cheese then served on spaghetti pasta. Try to imagine large juicy pieces of beef tossed in pasta. This is a very generously portioned, hearty & meaty dish. The sauce is less tomato marinara, and more rich meaty-meat sauce. Did I mention, it's meaty?  \"Baked to Order Desserts\" menu - If you like freshly baked, warm cookies, order the Chocolate Chip Pecan. They will bake these on order, so order them with your entrees. They come boxed to-go, so you can bring up to the room. Other baked-on-order goods - Chocolate Cake, Beignet & Apple Pie to name a few. I love munching on warm cookies in the room... (the chocolate chip kind!)  Service was great. Our server Ronnie, was friendly, helpful & very attentive to our table. Even with a little-late cookie order & an extra order to-go, he did an excellent job accommodating our requests. An overwhelming selection & variety of items on the menu in an extravagant not-so cafe-like setting. I think I'll skip the sister restaurant next time, 'cause after coming here, that other place just seems a little \"cheesy\" now.",

Even though I work for another casino, I occasionally tell guests to eat here because it's so good. :-) I always used to joke that they add a special spice called \"yum\" to every dish. Every dish I have ever ordered here has been good and consistently good. They've never had an off day. I was told by one of the servers that every dish is checked by no less than 3 people before it hits your table to ensure it's right. My favorite dishes are: chicken pot pie, shrimp scampi, and the Baja omelet for breakfast. They have a breakfast buffet on Sundays that is also really good. Oh and order the COOKIES!!! Trust me, that come out all hot and chocolatey and buttery! They have pecans in it but you really can't taste them. So good!",

I think it's related to Cheesecake Factory so the decor looks exactly like Cheesecake Factory without the long line.  They start you off with some nice warm, crunchy sour dough bread.  I ordered a small portion of crispy calamari for appetizer.  Nice size for a small portion.  They do a really nice Chicken Caesar salad.  I had breakfast and the portions were so large, I couldn't finish.  I swear they must use five eggs for that breakfast platter.  I'm pretty nosey and love to check out what everyone else is eating.  Everything was so huge and looked fabulous!  They only down side of our dinner was the fries were served cold.  As soon as we brought it to our waitresses attention, she brought out a fresh batch for my friend  pretty quick.    We went to the one in the Palazzo hotel and I was surprised that it was so empty.  The bellman at our hotel suggested that one because he said the one at the Venetian is always so crowded.

We expected to like the beignets the most as we have had them elsewhere, but we ended up liking the butter cake the best. We would get both the beignets and butter cake again but would likely try either the warm sticky bun bread pudding, key lime pie or \"the best\" carrot cake instead of the red velvet cake next time we are in town.  We used to the Grand Lux Cafe at the Beverly Center for dessert after dinner when it was still open. We would always get the beignets because it is one of the few places that do beignets well in Los Angeles. On our recent trip to Las Vegas, we stopped by to get the beignets which were again very good. They are a bit crunchy on the outside with a soft hollow interior, sprinkled with confectioner's sugar on top. I like them plain without using the sauces, but they do come with a vanilla custard sauce, raspberry sauce and chocolate sauce if you are so inclined. They take about 20 minutes and come out warm, so order them early if you know you are going to get them.   The warm butter cake was surprisingly good, probably on par with the butter cake at Mastro's. This one is served with fresh strawberries and vanilla ice cream. The butter cake comes out warm with a slightly crisp outside and a warm, soft, rich interior. This actually turned out to be our favorite dessert.  As for the red velvet cake, there is nothing to write home about here. It is served with the typical cream cheese frosting, but the cake itself was not that flavorful. You have definitely had better red velvet cake elsewhere. You should go right past this dessert and try something else.",

    "text": "So despite what you might think many of the restaurants in Vegas aren't 24/7. One night during our stay in Vegas hubby and I were going on a wild goose chase for some late food. We walked around in a circle looking for an open restaurant only to end up being saved by this place which we originally passed by.   They are located inside of the Venetian hotel situated by the casino. The place itself is small compared to it's NY location inside of Roosevelt Field Mall which I've been to. Luckily it was very late so we  didn't have a wait to eat.   I had the potato gnocchi with vodka sauce. I'll be honest with you I did like it and I really enjoyed it but I didn't write anything down so I don't really remember much to give an accurate description of the taste except that it was delicious.   If you are by the Venetian in Vegas the Grand Lux is worth eating in.",

    "text": "This is a nice place to come for a meal.  I gave it four stars because it still feels like a big, well executed chain, like Cheesecake Factory (its owners), and the menu is so big that there are apparently several very average things you can order.  I was able to order well by reading previous reviews, so here are the menu items i experienced (below).  It is big, opulent, and modern, with mildly attentive service.  Asian Nachos: 5 stars, my favorite part of the meal.  Peanut ginger glaze, fried wontons, wasabi cream and mozzarella.  Full of delicious flavor, we nearly licked the plate.  Short Rib Grilled Cheese: 4 stars, moist meat with horseradish cream sauce.  The bread was toasted pretty crispy, the cheese was good.  Included was a house salad; the blue cheese dressing I ordered was good.  Turkey Sandwich: 3 stars, my friend got it and the thick baguette it was served on was too thick and too toasted, making it hard to bite into.",

    "text": "If you are a fan of the Cheesecake Factory, you should definitely check out the Grand Lux Cafe when you are at the Palazzo or the Venetian.   I came here for dinner with my parents last week. My parents don't eat beef or pork, so it was kind of difficult to find restaurants on the Strip that had more than one or two good non-beef-or-pork options. Luckily, the Grand Lux Cafe has a plethora of dishes of all sorts. The menu here has to be the longest I've ever seen. As someone who is not a picky eater, I normally hate long menus, but I was grateful for it in this case, because my parents could finally choose a dish they really wanted. If you have a large party of people with different dietary requirements or cuisine  preferences, I would highly recommend this place.  Our server was great. My mom ordered the jambalaya, and the server made sure that the chefs made it without the ham. She was also attentive and knowledgeable about the menu.  The food was quite good. I had the crispy caramel chicken. The caramel sauce was a good balance of sweetness and spiciness, and all of the vegetables were fresh and cooked well. The portions are gigantic though! I have a healthy appetite, yet I was only able to eat about 3/5 of my meal. Unless you are really hungry, I would recommend sharing an entree with someone.  While looking at the menu, we saw that Grand Lux Cafe offers made-to-order desserts (which you order at the same time of your main dishes), so we decided to try the peach cobbler. While the cobbler was really good (not too sweet, lots of peach), it wasn't quite as spectacular as I thought it would be. However, I'm from Texas so I have pretty high standards for cobbler.   Overall, we all enjoyed our food here. I think the value you get is good compared to most of the other restaurants on the Strip too.",

    "text": "We went here past midnight on 12/25/2013. We were just waling around tired, confused, and hungry inside the Palazzo. The Grand Lux Cafe was one of the first signs we saw while walking in the casinos, so we decided to just go for it foregoing checking out yelp reviews because, at that point, we just needed to eat!  First, regarding the staff service... Even working that late (or early?) and on Christmas day, the staff were really nice and accommodating. The service here was really good.  Trivia: While waiting for our orders, I noticed a lady having a carry-out and the restaurant's to-go bag looked awfully very much the same as the Cheesecake Factory! So, after some googling, I got to find out that the Grand Lux Cafe is created by the founder of the Cheesecake.  So, for our food, we really enjoyed it and the servings are huge! My mom ordered the Garlic Shrimp pasta ($19.50). It was really good! It has lots of shrimp, heirloom tomatoes, and some veggies.. I forgot what it was but it was good! I think I ate at least a third of her dish. Hehe.  I ordered the Grilled Steak sandwich ($13.95), and you can choose your side of salad or fries. The steak was really savory and tender. The sandwich also has heirloom tomatoes, caramelized onions, white cheddar cheese, horseradish sauce and lots of yummy nutty arugula on a toasted artisan roll. Sooooo good!  My brothers both had chicken and waffles ($13.50). I didn't get to try it but their plates were all wiped out clean so I guess they really liked it too. Hehe.   My brothers also had orange juice, which came on quite a small wine glass. There was no price for the OJ on the menu, but we didn't bother to ask since we didn't think it's gonna be more than $3. The bill came and that small glass of OJ came out to be $5.95! Wow, that was almost half the price of my awesome sandwich! I wished they just had water since it was my turn to pay. Hmpf!  Overall, the dining experience here was good and relaxed. I would come back again if I am in the Palazzo and get tired and lost after playing from all the slot machines outside to help make me feel better! :)",

Why 2 stars?  The service sucks here.  I came here like 5 to 10 times this summer as I was playing poker tournaments at the Palazzo.  With a 60 minute dinner break, I barely had enough time to eat my dinner, even though I ran from the tournament to the restaurant to put in my order.  Consistently, my food didn't show up until 40 minutes after I had ordered, leaving me 20 minutes to scarf down my food and pay.  Consistently they couldn't even get a basket of fucking bread to me in the first half hour of my arrival.  That's just ridiculous.  I came back once after the poker tournament series was over, thinking it would be better since it wasn't so slammed.  I ordered a salad and a main course.  I sat there forever, asking twice for a basket of bread.  First thing to arrive?  My main course.  WHAT THE FUCK I HATE THAT!  I told the waiter to cancel my salad, who wanted to argue with me that he tried to warn me that the salad would take forever.  No, I asked which appetizer comes out the quickest since I'm starving, and he said they all take the same amount of time.  So I got the salad instead, which does not take the same amount of time to make as the cedar planked salmon.  Oh, and the bread finally came after I had started my dinner.  Do yourself a favor and take a walk down to the Venetian Grand Lux so you won't be twiddling your thumbs with a grumbling stomach for a half hour.",

I ordered the Chicken Royale which was 2 HUGE flat pieces grilled with a lemon butter cream sauce, I think, and mashed potatoes, green beans and carrots.  The chicken was tender & tasty, but only about 2 teaspoons of sauce for the huge amount of chicken, so I asked for more and was brought a small silver pitcher of it.  Made it MUCH better -the sauce was delish.  The potatoes & veggies were fine, nothing special.  This meal was very reasonably priced but kind of on the caliber of an average coffee shop. Enough food on that plate for 2 people.",

    "text": "Went here for brunch on Christmas day.  Did not realize that those with a Gracie card got priority seating (until it was too late).  Wait time at 10am was around 20-30mins for a party of 5.  Those that had 2-3 people were seated right away.  The restaurant was packed.  Their breakfast buffet was simple but seems to be a decent value at $18 ($9 for kids).  Came with Egg, bacon, hash browns, sausage in chaffing bowls.  There was a pretty decent fruit selection and pastries.  The omelette station was pretty crowded.  Wait time for an omelette was around 15mins.  The belgium waffles kept running out.  They had two stations for the omelettes (manned by 2 chefs)  but the chefs also had to make and stock the waffle stations.  Too crazy!  The fruits and pastries kept running out.  They also were running out of plates and were bringing piping hot plates (still soaked in hot water) to refill.  If you are in a hurry, go for the buffet. We ordered off the menu and it took a really long time to get our order.  I ordered the corn beef hash.  It was ok.  My wife got the chillaquilles (sp?) and that had a really nice flavor.  Only complaint was that it was hard to eat.  They used both chips and tortilla strips. Service:  Was pretty slow but I felt that the server was overwhelmed by the amount of people.  She was really polite and nice.  Just slow.   Value:  I think for vegas, things were priced pretty well.  My corn beef hash was $13 and a decent amount.  If you need a simple meal, this is the place to go.",

It's causal, flexible, and you can have whatever you like, however you like it, whenever you like it.  Poached eggs and a burger at 2AM?  The Grand Lux can make it happen.  The food at the Venetian location tastes noticeably better.  My recommendations include the miso salmon, the grilled veggie pizza, Chipotle avocado burger, the spaghettini with clams, and the calamari.  The calamari merits its own sentence--we're talking squid, rock shrimp (think mini shrimp tempura), zucchinis, and onions.  For the price, it's basically the best calamari you'll ever get.  Now, the Palazzo location has better desserts (the menu is almost entirely different).  I highly recommend the molten chocolate cake (see my pictures and you'll know what I mean).",

Other than that, I really like this place. Service is excellent, food is good, prices are reasonable, what more can you ask for? After eating at the Studio Cafe at MGM last week and paying exorbitant prices for mediocre sandwiches and chicken fingers, Grand Lux Cafe was very refreshing. I had the Bistro Steak which was a small steak with polenta and brussels sprouts and it was the perfect size for me. A couple of my friends ordered pastas and they were HUGE - literally enough for 3 people. Like the Cheesecake Factory, Grand Lux also has a variety of small plates and appetizers to choose from as well.  I would definitely come back the next time I'm at Palazzo or Venetian. No, it's not the most unique dining experience in Vegas, but open 24 hours and well priced for a hotel restaurant? Count me in!",

    "text": "Exactly what we were looking for at the Palazzo-Venetian.  It's probably the only dine-in restaurant in the resort with an extensive menu of comfort foods, with reasonable prices to match.  This place is essentially a Cheesecake Factory.  From what we were told, the Palazzo wanted to build a Cheesecake Factory but they had a non-compete agreement with the Mirage.  So they just changed the name to Grand Lux Cafe.  But it is pretty much the same food and concept.    The menu is extensive and has something for every taste.  The all-inclusive breakfast ($12.99) was the best deal, and was how I started my day everyday.  I'm typically not overwhelmed by breakfast, but the breakfast at Grand Lux was the best I've ever had.  They also have great sandwiches and burgers.  I'd consider myself to be a burger aficionado and theirs was right up there with the best.    If you're looking for a great meal, at very reasonable prices, this is where you should go.  It's a very casual and comfortable restaurant, and a refreshing change from the over-priced restaurants that surround it.",

And while it was part of a chain, it was nice to know (a little) of what to expect.  Because I used it for my reception I'm reviewing its private dining...  My then husband-to-be and I first saw this Grand Lux the day before our wedding when we went to pay off our balance.  (I didn't want to have to worry about this the day of.)  We met with the manager who was so welcoming, and not in the fake-y way (that I myself am often accused of :) We only had a total of 15 guests make their way to Vegas, and I'm sure that this size of private party is peanuts to this establishment but you'd never know it from the way the staff treated us.  After paying the remainder of our bill, I asked to see the room where our reception would be help, and the manager took us THROUGH the kitchen to reach the room.  The kitchen staff welcomed us, but also didn't seem surprised to see patrons off the street (and after 8+  hours of traveling) in the back of the house.  Says a lot about how the restaurant is ran.  Our reception was perfection.  We only had one server, I'm embarrassed I don't remember her name (probably b/c she made sure my hand always had a fresh glass of wine in it) but she was amazing.  She kept everything running smoothly, and everyone extremely happy.  The food was great, our guests had the option of a chicken madreidra, miso salmon, or pasta fresca, and I heard everything I never had the chance to try was perfect.   For the elevated level of service, quality of food, and sophisticated ambiance, as destination wedding bride, I feel that the Grand Lux Cafe went above and beyond in value.  Especially in Vegas!  Highly, HIGHLY recommended.",

The manager comes over to apologize and promises our meals will be out in 2 minutes. He then tells us our breakfast is on him. Fine, as it should be at this point. Our meals come to our table finally and it doesn't taste good enough for a 50 minute wait. Our check arrives and sure enough, only the French toast was comped!

This place fit the bill.   We started with the double stuffed potato spring rolls. They were AMAZING!!!  They tasted like a cross between potato skins and potato blintzes. Order these!!!  They were my favorite part of the meal.   For our entrees, I ordered the Cafe Beef Wellington which was paired with mashed potatoes, mixed veggies, and puffed pastry in a Madeira sauce. The sauce was nice and the meat was cooked perfectly but the puffed pastry was weird. It was disconnected from the rest of the dish. It seemed like the pastries were just tossed on top and I had a hard time figuring out how to eat them with the meal. They were wet from the sauce, so I couldn't just pick them up and they were also tough to cut. This dish was tasty but I wouldn't order it again.  My fiance ordered the T-Bone Steak; again nice dish but nothing memorable.   The dishes are fairly priced and the restaurant is conveniently located right off the casino floor in the Venetian. If you are looking for a quick bite and aren't feeling the food court, this is a good option, it's just nothing to write home about.",

For a buffet, I expected like warm and just ok potatoes but wow. I got seconds of these. I, then, moved to the omelette bar. Whoever is making those omelettes will NOT let you down. I got everything except tomatoes. The eggs were phenomenal, cooked perfectly, I had a nice cheesy crust, it was everything I wanted and more.  The buffet also showcases sausage, ham, waffles, normal eggs (although I'd just get some scrambled ones at the omelette station, personally), some very fresh fruit, Pastries, and a toast station with bagels.   I'd also 100% recommend the fresh squeezed orange juice. It was great! The service we had was a bit lacking but the food was perfection.",

We checked in after 11 pm and this place was the only convenient option to feed a family of 4 without having to drive somewhere.  The food options late night were plenty and can satisfy any cravings.  I highly recommend the turkey burger which came as an elevated sandwich with crusty bread and the fries were perfectly crispy.  For breakfast I recommend the crab omelette filled with real crab meat.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I came to Grand Lux cafe multiple times for breakfast.  It was so close to the elevators and, looking at their menu, we were impressed by the variety of options and how reasonably priced their food items were (i.e. averaged about $15/meal).    During our time, we ordered: breakfast quesadilla, chicken and waffles, huevos rancheros, deluxe breakfast sandwich (X2) and spring garden omelette.    Every time we ordered, the food was very good but found the portion sizes way too big.  We do not like wasting food so we would either have to pack it to go or simply finish and not eat anything else until evening.  I think the restaurant should consider giving slightly smaller portions so that customers wouldn't leave with doggy bags or a food coma.  My favourite item was the breakfast quesadilla as it comes with globs of sour cream and amazing chunky guac. The side of hash browns were delish! My boyfriend really enjoyed the deluxe breakfast sandwich.  My least favourite was the chicken with waffles.  The chicken was a bit too dry and flavourless. The sweetness of the syrup with the crunchy dry flavourless chicken did not pair well.   Their servers were courteous, smiley and attentive to our needs like coffee/water refills, how are doing, etc but almost too attentive at times that it became a bit bothersome.  The coffee was a bit overpriced ($4.50 for a cup) and it made more sense to order a latte/cappuccino/mocha since those drinks only costed $1-2 more.    Overall, we found the dining experience here \"okay\".  The food was decent and reasonably priced but portions were just too big and made the meals hard to enjoy.  The restaurant should put more emphasis on quality instead of quantity and take away menu items that aren't great (chicken and waffles for example).",

Upon entering, the hostess was cold and unwelcoming. There were plenty of tables available in the seating area after midnight. I requested  to be seated in a quiet area. They seated me by the mop/ cash register/ dishes area room. I was extremely uncomfortable with waiters going in and out of that room, whilst brushing up against my table. I asked my waitress to move me to a quieter table away from the mop room. She said she would ask the hostess. She told me she couldn't move me. This provided an unpleasant dining experience.  I ordered the chicken picatta with a glass of white wine. The food was just ok. The chicken was dry and flavorless. The wine... well, it's wine! With wine, I don't discriminate... so, it complimented the unsatifactory meal and made it just bearable. I will not be returning to this restaurant. The customer service was lacking. The hostess was rude. The waitress was unaccomodating. And the food was mediocre.",

    "text": "The experience: - Pasta carbonara ($17.50) This is a classic pasta dish and is personally special to me, two reasons why I would definitely recommend this dish :) However, keep in mind that by nature, the carbonara is a very rich, heavy cream/egg/ bacon based pasta dish so it does get heavy quickly.  - Cafe beef wellington ($21.95) I had such high hopes for this and was quickly let down. The dish comes with 4 pieces of filet mignon beef wellington (not prepared in the traditional sense where the meat is surrounded by puff pastry, this was just filet mignon with puff pastry on top of it), brussel sprouts, mashed potatoes, and carrots.    And damn, the beef is salty. It is already over seasoned which means that the \"sauce\"  basically was an overkill. Highlight of this dish was the brussel sprouts, which was well seasoned and cooked.  - Pastrami Reuben ($16) This was way. too. oily. My dad had subsequently stopped eating all of dinner after having eaten about a quarter of this sandwich. Quite disappointed.  Why you would come here:  - They're opened 24 hours!  - 5-10 min wait on 8pm Wednesday night - Plenty of seating.  - Extensive menu.  - Great service and attentiveness, provided by Eugene today.  Why you wouldn't come here: - It seem that the food is in general, decent, but inconsistent. Since only 1/3 of the entrees were acceptable, two stars are docked   Cheers!",

We literally eat EVERY meal exclusively at Grand Lux for our ENTIRE stay. Simply can't be beat, with over 200 items on the menu it's easy to get whatever you're craving!  With all that said, I must say that this year was EXCEPTIONAL! From the girls at the hosts stand to the best managers ever: Dan, Miguel, and Tanya, we felt like we were treated like royalty every time we walked in the door. Gus, Efrain, Gina, Madison, Angelica, Jen, & Shannon were such great servers to us! Efrain & Gus, Jen & Gina really went above and beyond for us & and because it was so perfect at every meal, I feel kinda guilty saying that, since every one of the staff worked so hard to make every meal special! I have certain dietary needs and they were met with such ease. My husband had some of the best meals by trying a few of the new menu items. The Bourban Street Chicken and the Baked Rigatoni should win awards! We always love the Salisbury Steak and the breakfast menu too!  We know Las Vegas is a food mecca but do yourself a favor and go to Grand Luz Palazzo side, Ask for these outstanding hard working people and feast on AMAZING food!!

    "text": "Located in the Palazzo, it was the quickest and most convenient place to grab breakfast on our first morning in Vegas. Being a sister company to the Cheesecake factory (and having visited the Chicago Location) we figured this would be a great option. We were seated right away and told they had a breakfast buffet for $19. Compared to the menu choices and their prices, we figured it would be our best bet (the menu wasn't huge and the prices were Vegas high). The buffet is why I am giving the 2 star. it was less than exciting and i thought for $20 a person, it should be exciting. There was an omelette station, and a hot station (eggs, sausage, bacon, hash browns), fruit, and pastries that looked store bought. Was it good? Meh, it was average. Nothing was outstanding.. just basic fair.  Usually Vegas expensive food is at least exciting.. just felt this was not worth the price. We did a better job at vetting out our breakfast options the rest of the trip.",

We felt very rushed which put a damper on our experience from the get go. We decided to get some drinks while we were waiting and when we told the server we were only ready to put in drinks he was visibly annoyed and didn't repeat the order or anything just simply walked away from the table. Once we were finally ready to order, our server never checked on us again. Had he, he would have known that I found cardboard in my omelette. So I told the food runner and they offered to replace it which was kind, but at that point I was just completely aggravated with the experience as a whole.

The food wait was super long for those sandwiches the manager came to apologize - they should have made one order or drink free part of their apology. The drinks were great: blood orange mimosa and rum punch good combo of flavours and alcohol. My sisters peach Bellini was too mild on the alcohol. would visit there again but maybe just for drinks or late night food.",

However, when the BGB and I wanted to hit up some food after his shift at work, he recommended the Cheesecake Factory. \"It's open 24 hours,\" he said.  Well, he really meant this place, which mildly worried me, since now I was inside the V/P at one of their restaurants, and my wallet was still on a Luxor budget. Fortunately, the food was really good. Turns out Grand Lux Cafe is managed (?) by the same people as Cheesecake Factory, which always puts out a good product. Bread is nice and tasty to start. We both had burgers (because you know I love burgers) and the meat was tender and flavorful. The atmosphere was nice -- you didn't feel like you were in what amounts to a casino cafe.  Maybe one time when I have a little more money to spare I'll try a more signature dish, but for a first start it was rather good.",

They make a pretty tasty salad here with lots of dark greens. I've tried their flatbread style pizza. Not bad. I think you're better off going to an italian place or specialty pizzeria if that's what you want.  I've enjoyed their burger here as well. It's big and juicy but considering all the excellent burger options you have in this town, I wouldn't recommend ordering it. The fries are acceptable but I've had better to be sure.  Desert options are probably the redeeming quality of this establishment. Everything from waffles to their assortment of pies and sundae creations is pretty mouthwatering, especially when you've got those irresistible late night cravings.   The bottom line is that this place is pretty decent, but I don't think they live up to their pricing or their prestigious image. Good food, but is it great? Not in my opinion. Give 'em a shot if you're around--I'm sure you'll like them. But I wouldn't expect to be blown away.",

The have a pretty eclectic and extensive menu.. idk how anyone makes up their mind.. I'm a vegetarian so it greatly reduces the menu size for me, but there are still a plethora of options. Like Cheesecake Factory there is no signature dish that they do exceptionally well that everyone comes in for, but just a huge variety of items that are all at least fairly good, perfect for a group because there is something for everyone.   Some of my favorite 4am after club snacks:   Potato Spring Rolls (I order without the bacon) - Definitely something different to put basically baked potato ingredients into a fried spring roll.. but its definitely tasty & the perfect late night comfort food.   Jalapeno-Cheese Cornbread- take 3 yummy ingredients and add them together? works here :)   Macaroni & Cheese Skillet - I make it better at home, but this is definitely good for a restaurant (I've ordered macncheese at a lot of places and I think they try to fancy it up or something.. but it usually doesn't work out so well.. this one is a decent late night snack)   Edamame - can't really go wrong here, but these ones do have a sauce thats pretty good.   Fried Pickles - yum   Zucchini and Onion Haystack- never a bad choice.   Crispy Sesame Tofu - savory but still on the healthier side of things.   Whipped Sweet Potatoes - sweet n savory  *MOST IMPORTANTLY (in by book anyway!) the DESSERTS:   Grand Lux is a sweet tooth's paradise!    It's a late night/early morning tradition of ours to get the box of Fresh homemade chocolate chip pecan cookies & milk.. soo so warm gooey & good!! perfect comfort food!   Molten Chocolate Cake, New Orleans Beignets, Peach Cobbler, Butterscotch Caramel Pudding, Pineapple Upside-Down Cake, Apple Pie, Strawberry Shortcake,  Creme Brulee Duo, Bread Pudding,  Cupcakes, Banana Vanilla Wafer Pudding, Key Lime, Red Velvet, Carrot Cake.. all sooo good!   With a list like that I have no idea how anyone chooses!   They have two of my favorite Cheesecake Factory Cheesecakes: Dulce De Leche Caramel  White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle  mmm...   I haven't tried the \"Cupcake Collision,\" sounds pretty fun: \"Rich Chocolate Cupcakes Collide with Vanilla Ice Cream, Hot Fudge and Whipped Cream.\"",

I thought Vegas was picking it...trying to play with the big boys like NYC, San Fran and L.A. It's just not happening.  For the prices at this place, you should expect more. $18 for a salad...no creativity whatsoever, no unique ingredients, not organic, etc.  Eat lunch elsewhere. Only thing that was good was their onion soup--and I don't care for onion, but this one was decent.",

The pasta is served al dente perfectly.  If you go during lunch special hours it's worth it at $14 a plate.  Plate is bigger than your face so you can share =)  They also have a separate menu for small dishes $3-7 a plate.  Great for those who just want to put something in their tummy to soak up all the alcohol!!!

A few of us (three in total) went here for breakfast on a Friday morning and it was pretty packed.  We got seated in 10-15 minutes but the service was pretty slow.  Our waitress didn't come to our table until a long while later and wasn't very good with topping off our waters, bummer.  But the food was very good, their bacon was done well, nice thick cut cooked crisp but yet a little tender.  Then there was the omelet, which my friend loved, eggs were done almost perfectly.  I had the corned beef hash.  This was their homemade corned beef and I think this is the first time that I would probably say this but, I think I would have preferred it if they processed it more.  It was nice but it was too thick and fibrous.  It's not your typical corned beef hash, it's definitely chunkier and more of a mouthful to handle.  It was OK but I would probably have ordered something else next time.  I saw our neighbors and one guy had a massively delicious looking french toast.   Either way, it was a very nice atmosphere for breakfast, breakfast was hearty and filling, the food was prepared well but their corned beef hash fell short and their service was lacking for a place like this.  Oh, they also have a \"buffet\" side of the restaurant because this is Vegas after all...",

The salmon doesn't have that \"fishy\" type after taste and the glaze really set the meal off.  My date had the crispy caramel chicken, which might be one of the top things that I've ever tasted.  It's really hard to explain but that chicken had a nice flavor to it, very nice texture and was accompanied by a bed of rice.  The crispy chicken is smothered by a nice Thai caramel sauce and comes with onions, mushrooms, garlic, as well as a few other spices.  I'd have to recommend going with that.  The prices are actually pretty good as well.  The portions are pretty huge so the prices were justified.  If you're staying at the Palazzo or Venetian, I'd definitely recommend dining here.",

The wait was only about 5 minutes to be seated and we were greeted right away and asked what we would like to drink and if we would like to order any appetizers. I ordered the edamame which were delicious. The edamame here are cooked in a sauce, not just steamed and sprinkled with sea salt. They were different, but really good. For dinner I had the BBQ chicken which was cooked perfectly. My friend had the fish and chips which she said she liked as well. The food is of course very similar to the food at Cheesecake Factory, but I would definitely come back again.",

Every time I have gone here I always get the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich mainly because of its sheer size and deliciousness. If you are looking for an inexpensive meal that is way too big to finish definitely try the chicken sandwich.  All in all this place is just a classy establishment with friendly, quick service and delicious food(if you can get through the gigantic menu).

We arrived @ 5 pm and was quickly seated. The place is pretty large, and the 20 or so groups in the restaurant only occupied perhaps 20% of the tables. At first, I thought our waiter was very attentive. However, as the evening wore on, he became more of a pest... This place has a large menu. My wife is recently from Japan and does not read English that fast, and are unfamiliar with many of the dishes, so I have to explain many of them to her. Despite the fact that I told our waiter I will need about 10 minutes before we're ready to order, he kept coming back every minute or two to ask if I was ready to order... what's his hurry?  We ordered alcoholic drinks. Funny, prices for alcoholic drinks are not on the menu... this should have given me a clue, but.... My wife and I both ordered Mohitos. They were $11 a pop.... this is nightclub bar prices... outrageous.  Then we shared chicken lettuce wraps $10, and a short rib sandwich w/fries $13  The lettuce wrap had good flavor but too much.  The taste was too thick, and after 2 bites, it quickly became too salty.  The short rib sandwich w/caramelized onion and melted cheese was very bland.  I would not go back here again.",

Granted, it was very late at night, one or two in the morning, so we missed prime time by more than a few hours.

There are two locations, one in the Venetian and the other in the Palazzo. Now before you Vegas \"know-it-alls\" get all CRAZY on me, I realize the two hotels are located right next to each other. The reason why there are two of them is because one is ALWAYS open 24 hours, but they switch it every now and then. And since I'm a frequent guest of either hotel, this place is a GODSEND when you finally stroll into your hotel at dawn!!  Yes...it is owned by the same company as Cheesecake Factory, but I find it far superior in service, quality, selection and overall satisfaction. The food is awesome and not overpriced like everything else in Vegas. I almost never get the same thing, but I do enjoy the burgers and pastas.   To be honest, we usually only go here to get the FRESHLY BAKED COOKIES!!! OMG...THEY ARE YUMMMMMMMMO!! They really do make them to order, so if you're planning on having them for desert, make sure you let your waiter know when they bring your food because they take about 25-30 minutes. Or...you can get them to go and they are perfect DRUNK FOOD!!  All in all...definitely my \"go to\" restaurant in Vegas!!",

I've been here for late lunch, dinner and breakfast. I have yet to have a bad experience. There is a great variety on the menu for everything. I loved the breakfast because they have a breakfast bar where you can get fresh omelets or any other kind of eggs made to order. My husband had fried chicken and waffles ( which I still gag thinking of ). Yes I tried it, but I just can't do it. We've shared chicken enchiladas, the taquitos and the mimosas are very yummy.

Ordered the Belgian waffle (doughy and came with a pecan syrup that tasted like nothing and was watery.  The eggs were ok. Hard to mess that up. The hash browns were solid  What irked me was the waiter who was slowly cleaning up our table while our group was working out the bill, peeking over to see our tip. The service was slower than average, considering we had to wait over 30 min for our food. I might had well have gone back there and cooked my own da** waffle",

Besides having to wait in the beginning, all meals were delicious and came out in a very timely manner. The decor is beautiful, it did get a little loud at times, but this in no way detracted from our enjoyment of the meal. Will definitely be returning on our next Vegas visit.",

The problem is that they make a little of everything (Mexican, Italian, Southern chicken n' waffles, etc)...but none of it is amazing.  I ordered the enchiladas because I was really craving Mexican, and it was very blah.  The corn tortillas were pretty tasteless, and the filling wasn't all that great.  The table loved the asian style nachos, but it's hard to mess up fried wontons.  My other table-mates ordered the chicken and waffles (the waffles WERE pretty good), some sort of asian-style noodle soup... I can't remember what the other folks got.  Again--I feel like for the price, we didn't get anything all that special.  I'd go here again if I was with another large group in the Palazzo/Venetian, but it wouldn't be my number 1 choice.",

I ordered a soda and never got a refill the entire time we ate. Also, my boyfriend & I's meal was $55, but when we got the check, our suggested gratuity on the check was $24 for 20%. Now, even for those who aren't quick at math, it's clear to see that's only $2 off from 50% gratuity for not that great of service. We let the waitress know what was wrong and she tried to deflect it by saying, \"oh, maybe it got connected to another check.\" Overall, my boyfriend & I believe they are trying to rip tourists off and get extra money on their tips. Make sure to do the math yourself or you'll give them way too much money.",

    "text": "Yep, this became a staple during my last trip to Vegas. We were staying at the Palazzo and couldn't figure out where to eat, so we stopped here after reading the reviews.   It's beautiful. It feels like you're walking into a very modern, well designed restaurant with bar. The finishes are great and I expected it to be dressy, but it was casual. Whew, not having a suit didn't ruin me this trip.  Our wait staff was all amazing, which really helps. Since I ate here quite a bit, I'm going to review each dish.  Smoked Salmon Platter with Tomato ($13.95) Onion, Cream Cheese and a Toasted Bagel. Very tasty. We didn't feel like a huge breakfast, so it was a good size. Maybe not the best value on the menu, but the quality was quite good.  Duck Triangles ($4.95) Crispy Wrappers Filled with Minced Duck, Onions, Garlic, Ginger, Soy and Sesame. Amazing. This was wonderful. The duck was perfect as there was enough to get the taste and it melded quite well with the dipping sauce. Must try in my humble opinion.   Mini Pizza's ($5.95) Tomato and Fresh Mozzarella: Cherry Tomatoes, Garlic, Mozzarella, Fontina and Parmesan Cheese. A great little pizza. So nice to share with another appetizer or if you're not super hungry, just the right size. Thin crust style that was very tasty and not greasy or oily.   Roasted Chicken and Potato:Roasted Garlic, Fresh Rosemary, Mozzarella and Parmesan Cheese. One of my favorite type of pizzas. I don't miss the tomato sauce at all and wow the flavors really pop on this one.   Blue Cheese Salad $(9.95) Organic Greens Tossed with Blue Cheese Dressing and Topped with Bacon, Tomato, Croutons and Maytag Blue Cheese Crumbles. Good salad. I liked it but I wanted to try something else. It went really well with the mini pizza though.  Chili-Lime Chicken and Mango Salad ($10.95) Grilled Chicken, Sweet Mango, Avocado, Jicama, Sweet Corn, Onions, Cilantro and Romaine, Tossed with Chili-Lime Vinaigrette and Crispy Tortillas.I ended up ordering this salad twice because it was so tasty. It was fresh, the mango added a little citrus, the avocado was creamy, the corn was awesome for adding texture with flavor, and there was a wonderful crunch from the tortillas.   Potato Gnocchi with Vodka Sauce ($13.95) Delicious Housemade Gnocchi Tossed in Creamy Vodka Sauce and Fresh Basil. Wow. Wow. It may have been the best Gnocchi I've had. Ever. Amazing texture and consistency that is lacking at most places. The vodka sauce was perfect for this. Paired really well with the previous salad I reviewed.  If you want a great place to eat with darn good prices, this is definitely the place.",

You order from the cafe next door and wait about 15 minutes for your food. I got the chopped salad and spaghetti with meatballs. Huge portions! It's the sister company to Cheesecake Factory so the decor inside the restaurant and the range of dishes are very similar. I've also dined in before and it's a great place for large parties. They have everything! Salads, soups, sandwiches, pastas, steaks, meatloaf... anything your heart desires!",

    "text": "Everyone makes fun of my boyfriend and I for eating here for every meal while we're in Vegas.   Reasons we love it: 1. Asian Nachos- most amazing creation known to man 2. Open late, so if you're up late drinking or gambling, it's a great place to fulfill a midnight snack/munchie 3. Everything on the menu is delicious 4. Open for all meals.  Breakfast is great here. 5. Something for everyone- every food genre you can think of, many different portion sizes (they have a small bites/tapas menu). 6. Affordable and casual. Don't feel like you have to dress up and get all schmoozy for every meal while you're in vegas.  This is a good \"normal people\" place.  While it's pricier than, say, Chili's, it's good for the portions you get.  Which leads me to.... 7. Big portions  I'm not joking. Everything really is good here.  Let's talk about the Asian Nachos first.  Big, round wontons with melted cheese, chicken, green onions, PEANUT SAUCE, WASABI CREAM SAUCE, and banging rice.  I dont know wtf they put in it but it's so freaking good.  I dream about Asian Nachos and crave them constantly.  I've forced all of my friends to try them and now they're all just as addicted.  For the reset of the food:  All of their soups are delicious, even if they sound boring, each one packs a punch of flavor.  I like ordering a lot of little things off the tapas menu.  Buffalo chicken bites? Hell yes.  Pastas are delicious, my boyfriend loves their pepperoni pizza- they give you tiny, perfectly crispy pepperonis.  Burgers are great.... literally everything is good.  For breakfast I had the chilaquiles and they were awesome.  This location in the Palazzo is better than the one in the Venetian because it's less known about and less crowded.  The one bad thing I can say is that service can be hit or miss.  I feel like I get bad service more often than good, but I don't care because it's so damn good.",

    "text": "I've  probably been to the grand luxe once before in my life.  I never really cared for it as i am not a fan of paying high prices for simple foods.  I went to this one because it was being paid for by someone else and I  wanted to give it another shot.  I ordered the whole egg omolette with a side of hash browns and sausage.  I wasn't  expecting much as it is the  only breakfast food i go out for and it is  hard to screw up.  The food came exactly as ordered and rather quickly for a restaurant of this size.  I usually expect nice and quick service from places that  charge the prices they do here and was not let down.  The person in our section (didn't  quite catch the name but it was a slight older, ethnic looking gentleman with bald hair)  was very nice throughout the entire experience and always came to check in on us, make sure we had full cups and were satisfied with our meals.  The only part of the entire experience that really didn't  sit well with me was at the very end when i was trying to get to go boxes.  I don't  know if it is customary  to box up the food for me but it was something that i would not want again.  My hashbrowns were placed under my omolette.  That would be fine if there wasn't ketchup all over the hashbrowns.  I'm sure i will probably end up eating them after i have a few beers tonight but would prefer to not have to resort  to that.  The atnosphere here was alright.  Fairly noisy which is to be expected but the people coming in fresh off a night  of drinkiny qnd partying really didn't  make for a good experience out the gate.  Random screaming made me wonder whether someone was proposing, won the lottery or just sold their tech startup (none of those were the case though).  I could do without that and that was a major factor in my rating decision.  I will probably attempt to eat here again (maybe earlier as i started at 12:00 PM) but it probably will  not be soon unless it is free again.",

Always nice to have place to soothe your drunchie cravings or early breakfast cravings! +They serve breakfast buffet for $17! If you're not particular about your dish and want to satisfy your cravings for eggs, hasbhrown, sausages, pancakes, fruits, and all the breakfast essentials then the breakfast buffet is worth your money.  -I didn't want to spend big bucks on breakfast buffet so I opted for chilaquiles. The chilaquiles was not authentic (should have known). It tasted good in it's own way but definitely steered away from what I was hoping. :/ -They are super strict on the breakfast hour operations. I really wanted to try their pasta dishes that was on their lunch/dinner menu but if you're dining before 11AM, it is strictly brunch menu only. boo.

The menu also had a drink section with an option of different cocktails and other drinks (including selected wine and draft beer). Not to mention, everything on the happy hour menu was only $5 for full size portions! I ended up ordering the blueberry mojito along with the passionfruit margarita, which were both amazing and added a twist to the traditional drink.

The Grand Lux Cafe at the Palazzo was just that for me.  Came here for breakfast because we wanted to stay close to the hotel.  After looking at a very uninspired breakfast buffet, we ordered off the menu.  I ordered \"The Best Eggs Benedict\".  Really, that's what it's called on the menu.  I would like them to change the name to  \"Not the Worst Eggs Benedict\".  Eggs were poached nicely, but the ham wasn't anything special.  A big slab of Louis Rich quality ham.  The english muffin was a pretty large compared to the poached egg.  It wasn't very toasted and thus got soggy underneath a pile of hollandaise sauce.  Way too much sauce going on here.  Fortunately it came with a side of hash browns to soak up all the sauce.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-5?start=300#4xIDFoFkv-erhPe8JFuqfw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gran...</a>  The wife had the DeLux Breakfast Sandwich, which came with scrambled eggs, ham, bacon, grilled tomato, and havarti cheese.

Fried eggs on top of corn tortillas, black beans, sauteed peppers and onions, with cheddar cheese topped with \"spicy\" ranchero sauce.  His biggest problem was that the ranchero sauce had no spice at all, in fact the whole dish was quite flavorless even though it looked nice.  He salvaged his breakfast with the help of tabasco sauce.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-5?start=300#Rmtzr49KIb2JE_Mev2HcGg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gran...</a>  The only hit were the breakfast beignets.  These were excellent.  This might have been the first time having a beignet, where I haven't thought, if only I were at the Cafe du Monde in New Orleans.  So often places try to do a knock off of those, but these seemed to be their own thing.  They were piping hot right out of the fryer with just a small amount of powdered sugar on them.  I'm normally a purest and want my beignets with lots of sugar and that's it, but these were served with 4 dipping sauces.  Lots of sugar would have gotten in the way here for dipping. My favorite sauce was sweet milk based, like a more liquid bavarian cream.  The raspberry sauce was also excellent.  Mixing the two sauces even better.  There was also a chocolate sauce and a cinnamon sugar based sauce.  There were at least 8 or 9 beignets in the basket, perfect for sharing.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-5?start=300#pd2HMS9A30TXlwNFPRAXxw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gran...</a>  If it's breakfast time, I would come back for beignets for sure and some coffee, but that's about it.  Not sure about lunch or dinner, you'll have to read other people's reviews on that.",

    "text": "Since Grand Luxe closed its doors in Los Angeles, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to come here while visiting Las Vegas. I have no complaints with the food or service. The only reason why I could give 4 or 5 stars was the fact that I noticed something lumpy in my salad dressing. Didn't request bleu cheese dressing so i knew it wasnt a clump of cheese. So I took it out and couldn't decipher what it was. It was brown and soft and about the size of a walnut. The first image that popped in my head was it looked like a waterbug (very gross). Instantly I lost my appetite. I called my server and brought it to his attention. He took the dressing. The manager came by and was very apologetic. He said it was a heirloom tomato. I was relieved to know that it was something edible (well a waterbug may be a delicatessen in another country) in the dressing. However, I wasn't hungry at that point, so I got it boxed to go. The bill came and noticed the manager took the salad off of the bill.  Other than the \"surprise\" in my salad dressing, I still enjoyed the food and the service.",

Very good choices and they came with a bagel and hash browns.   The lobster and asparagus omlet was amazing! It was the perfect amount of food and the lobster was so soft and the asparagus was a great balance! They chopped the asparagus too so it wasn't like huge pieces to be cut. The red velvet pancakes were the best idea ever! They weren't too sweet and had chocolate chips in them! It was great and it seemed like they had their own recipe for the maple syrup too, it wasn't too sweet.   Overall a good experience. Yes it's costly, but that has nothing to do with a review. I would say that they just need fresher fruits. I ordered the berries and some of them were old and smushed, one had some mold I think.",

All 5 dishes minus my jambalaya were bland, but there was no one to tell since he never asked how things were. Also three other tables were sat and he was rude to them too. We all come from serving experience so we were super nice it's not like we were difficult at all. I encourage the manager to look at cameras and see how their server is treating their guests.",

    "text": "I LOVE Grand Lux Cafe!   The first time we went, we tried to go to the one at the Venetian, which happened to be closed, but because it was so highly recommended, we trekked \"all the way\" to the one in the Palazzo. Definitely definitely worth it! A few Vegas trips later, I found myself back here again because my friend absolutely had to have the \"Grand Lux Burger Melt\" again and had been raving about it the entire weekend.  I don't think you could go wrong with ANY of the burgers on the menu. SO YUMMY! The chipotle mayo is indescribably good, and is delicious for dipping fries in. I had the \"Garlic-Blue Cheese Burger\" because I love garlic and I love blue cheese and it definitely did not disappoint. The garlic-blue cheese aioli is top notch (and also good for fry dipping.)  My only complaint is that they get BUSY and that causes a dramatic decrease in the quality of the service. We were STARVING when we arrived, and even though we had a large party (~10 people), we were seated relatively quickly, but waited forever for our food. The bread didn't even get to our table until we had been seated for at least 15-20 minutes. It also took forever to get our server's attention to bring us the check, and get it back to us. Eventually, we ended up just going up to their little kiosk to hand it to them.  Random Stuffs: Not a good place to lose at credit card roulette... not exactly a cheap meal to pay for everyone! Trust me. Also, beware the floors-- surprisingly slick!  tl;dr: REALLY GOOD BURGERS (the sauces are amazinggg), but slow service when they're busy.",

The hashbrowns were really good and probably the high light of the breakfast. Crispy and seasoned well. I also had a spicy bloody mary which I enjoyed.",

Finally, the chicken was not fried chicken, but rather a few chicken fingers.  edit:  I forgot about the butter.  It was a stick of regular butter, straight from a fridge.  It was completely unspreadable.  Pretty much everything about this place was poorly executed.",

I ordered the Delux Breakfast Sandwich and my bf ordered Chicken & Waffle. They both tasted great but nothing like having a mouth orgasm. The company is owned by Cheesecake Factory so their menu, as you can guess, just has way too many options.   The setting inside is a bit weird with the 2 seater. It's very close to the edge with the seat and table at weird angle so we switched to a table that seated 4.   The service was okay, not much service. Nothing to brag about.

Then we noticed that our appetizer had not come out. we waited and waited till the stupid server came out and asked him where is our appetizer and why the hell was a margarita pizza lacking red sauce? He answered that he thought that i wanted a sauceless pizza. What a damn idiot. If you are not sure about something you should ask your customer dont assume and jack up our order. We asked wheres the appetizer and he said he forgot. The restaurant was barely packed i dont know how this guy forgot our order. I guess this stupid kid should be in the back washing the dishes before he gets promoted to take orders. Ill stick with the original location with better service and more competent waiters.",

    "text": "Grand Lux is essentially the Cheesecake Factory under a different marquee (they actually get their cheesecake from Cheesecake Factory), but with larger portions and a more manageable menu.  The decor is very pleasant and contemporary, the service is friendly, and the prices are very reasonable considering the location and size of the portions.  I had the Zen Noodles, because I was a little tired of heavy food by this point in the trip.  It was basically a variation on pho, complete with cilantro, sprouts, and chicken, all served up in a tasty chicken-based broth.  They even provided sriracha.  I was satisfied.  It's a particularly great place to grab a quick bite if you're catching a showing of Jersey Boys, as it's about 30 feet from the theater.  No stress, and great food.",

    "text": "As I ate my breakfast at the Grand Lux Cafe, I imagined that if the chef was watching the diners experience he or she would have been screaming \"awww, bloody hell, @%#$ me\" just as Gordon Ramsay would be doing in one of his Kitchen Nightmares shows.   I can't cut them much slack here because I ordered very simple things that in and of themselves were just fine, but then ruined by the bloody awful execution of the service.  I'll start with the simplest of things... my usual morning after party night beverage of OJ & Club Soda.  Fresh squeezed OJ, should be awesome, right?  Add flat club soda and you have a flavorless mess.  Now on to the food... again I go simple.  I ordered blueberry pancakes.  I presume that they must have gone to a berry patch in North Arizona to pick the berries fresh because a pancake takes what, 10 minutes if you mix the batter from scratch?  Mine took over 30 minutes.  So this next part might sound nit-picky, but here goes... cold syrup for the pancakes and they didn't even bother to bring out butter.  Am I the only person who butters their pancakes?  No, because my mom showed me how to do that when I was a tyke.  So after another 10 minutes the butter appears.  It's ice cold.  You almost needed a steak knife to cut this butter.  So it's not going to spread, it's not going to melt down in the cold syrup and the temperature of the pancake is going fast.  I can either send this back or power through.  I choose to power through and just get out of there.  The pancake itself was tasty.  I think the berries really were fresh.  The front of the house service wrecked it all.",

I've had the crispy flautas, chicken pasta w/ sun-dried tomatoes and mushrooms, pasta carbonara, pasta molino, and others and loved them all. The portions are HUGE too--perfect to split with your friend or to have leftovers for more munchies when you're drunk again 4 hrs later. And if you go during lunch, they have lunch-sized portions (which are still big) of the pastas for a few bucks cheaper.   My only complaint is the service. Just as I've never been disappointed by the food, I've never been happy with the service. The bread often comes out after the food and a few pointed requests for it, the food always takes forever to be served, and the waitresses rarely come by to check on our table to refill our drinks or see how we're doing. I understand their desire to give us a wide berth when our party is a group of 12 drunkasses, but it's been like that even when I've gone with 2 other girls completely sober and composed in the middle of the afternoon.",

    "text": "Came here for a quick casual lunch before leaving for the airport to go home. We were going to come here for lunch the day prior but our group was too big and the wait was forever. But on this day, there was only 3 survivors so we got a table right away.   This place is owned by the same owners of Cheesecake Factory. That gives you the general description, price, atmosphere, of the place.   We got there in time for breakfast foods which they serve til 11am. I shared the Belgian waffles with strawberry with a side of scrambled eggs. My friend got the chillaquilles which were AMAZING. I've never had them before, and I'm not sure how they taste like anywhere else. But they were really good at this place! It's like tortilla chips topped with eggs, salsa, avocado, cheese, beans, etc. It was really good.   The server we had was great. Very friendly, talkative, and quick. However, I have one tip for the hostess stand. Apparently, the lead host takes your name and how many people in your party and finds a table on the POS system and probably because it's such a big restaurant and there are many hostesses who seat guests and the lead host doesn't have the time to stand there and wait for an actual host to come up and verbally tell them where to seat the guests, they print out a receipt thing that tells the hostess where to seat the guests. This is fine but every time she printed it out, she put it on the counter that stands between the guests and herself. So many of the guests, reach for the ticket. And she has to tell each one \"no this is not for you\" / \"this is for the hostess\" etc and she looked irritated each time she said it. So maybe putting it somewhere where the guests don't reach for it would make sense..",

    "text": "My wife and I spent 3 days in Vegas, staying at the Palazzo. With so many restaurants to choose from, we still ate at the Grand Lux once everyday, which allowed us to try breakfast and lunch at the Grand Lux Palazzo, and dinner at the Grand Lux Venetian - it was that good! Really! In fact, if you consider \"value for money\", I think it can't be beat anywhere in Vegas.  The service is wonderful, attentive and friendly. The ambiance is what you would expect for a hotel as nice as the Palazzo or the Venetian, yet the atmosphere is very unassuming and not at all stuffy, like either Batali's or Lagasse's restaurants. And the prices are very reasonable for such high quality food!  Between us we tried the Grand Lux breakfast sandwich (served all day in case you missed breakfast, as I did), regular ol' eggs, bacon, toast (done perfectly with bacon that was crispy and not greasy, baked perhaps?) and the breakfast buffet (we both enjoyed it, but my wife thought there should have been more variety).   Just days before visiting Vegas, I had been reminiscing about enjoying Sloppy Joe's as a kid, so when I saw it on the Grand Lux menu, I had to try it. It was made, I believe, with rib meat instead of hamburger, and served on brioche bread instead of a bun, with fries. I told my wife that it was the best Sloppy Joe I have ever had!  My wife ate a mushroom pasta dish which she enjoyed and I munched on some buffalo chicken rolls that were absolutely wonderful! The pasta was delicious and she regretted being unable to take it home and put the leftovers in the fridge. Portion size is always more than enough. The chicken rolls were made out of chicken breast (done perfectly), placed into spring roll covers, with cheese, then deep fried, served with wonderful buffalo dipping sauce. Wow!   I washed the chicken rolls down with a couple glasses of Texas Tea (think Long Island). Unlike the food, drinks will set you back some, but it was worth it for at least one celebratory evening.  Oh, and because it is a Cheesecake Factory restaurant (yes, it really is!), we shared a piece of white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake, and you know how good that must have been - and it was. Yum!   BTW, the menu is definitely different from Cheesecake Factory, although you will still find some of your favorites there, if that is what you are looking for.   So, if you are staying anywhere on the Las Vegas strip, do yourself a favor and take the time to eat at the Grand Lux restaurant in either the Palazzo or Venetian. You will NOT be sorry!",

    "text": "Went to the Palazzo Grand Lux after seeing John Fogerty at the Venetian last night. As a Las Vegas local we don't venture out on the \"Strip\" often...but I have been to the Venetian location of the Grand Lux (same 'property') and have always been very pleased. Good food and decent portion sizes. This time we opted for the Palazzo location and I was very disappointed. Ordered \"Grand Lux Burger MELT\" -- \"...LOTS of cheddar cheese...\"  The 'melt' arrived and I was very surprised at how smallish it was (comparing to the Lux's usual larger portions). The fries were warm not hot -- and tasted as if they'd been sitting under a heating lamp much too long. Was tired and famished after the show so just picked at the fries and bit into the sandwich. Didn't feel an urge to say anything about the fries. Ate the first half and was not impressed with taste. Something seemed off. Boring. Not their usual quality. Took a closer look at what was left of the 'melt'. There was absolutely no visible cheese at all. Just an orange-y sauce. I showed my wife. \"Do you see any cheese?\". I called for the waiter and showed him. He seemed baffled. Almost like something fishy was going on. He actually asked \"what happened to it?\" I felt he was implying I somehow removed the cheese and maybe added it to the first half. I very clearly let him know that the menu describe this \"melt\" as having \"Lots of cheddar cheese\". He took the plate back to the kitchen and eventually returned with it and said that the kitchen told him that the cheese was right there -- pointing to the mystery sauce. I ran my finger through the 'sauce' and said -- \"...this is like mayonnaise -- there is no cheese at all. Am I not seeing something?\" He seemed baffled and a little embarrassed. I asked for the manager who came over and listened to me and didn't really respond. I asked him point blank -- \"Is there cheese on here I'm not seeing?\". He just kept nodding his head not committing. I pointed out that the menu declared \"LOTS of cheddar cheese\" so there should be at least some evidence of the product! He offered us a dessert 'on the house'. I declined and said we were finished. I also asked him if my 'melt' would be taken off the check. It was but that did not alleviate the complete comical serving of a meal that would have easily been bested by Jack-In-The-Box and one of their 'patty-melts'.   What I think was happening is they had a lazy/inept chef late in the evening on a Friday night (the food took unusually long coming out and at this time of night the place wasn't as busy as it can be) and was being stubborn with the waiter. I'm sure I'll try the Lux again based on my satisfying past experiences but it will likely be at the Venetian location instead of the Palazzo.",

    "text": "We ate here for breakfast two mornings while staying at the Palazzo. We had a deal where we were credited for two continental breakfasts with our reservation, so we didn't want to miss out on free food.  The first morning we just stuck to the free breakfasts, and threw in a side of bacon. The continental included 3 small pastries and fruit. The pastries were not something I would go back for...it was a mixed bag, some were tasty (mini chocolate croissant), some were not so hot (dry weird bran muffin). Also, the fruit was not really ripe -- especially the melon. Our waitress was super nice though and noticed we didn't eat the fruit so swapped out the unripe melon without us asking.  The next day we ventured away from the free continental breakfast since we figured we'd still get a partial credit on our bill.   We tried the beignets which were awesome and had four dipping sauces: a bourbon custard and raspberry were especially good. Also they give you a big baket!  For our actual meal my husband got corned beef hash and I got a breakfast sandwich. His was very good, especially the corned beef. Mine was okay...nothing exceptional. Both our hash browns were off...I asked for extra extra crispy and they came out barely cooked and pale...his we're very browned but oddly soggy.  Also, not sure what is with the coffee but I really didnt care for it. I love strong coffee, and this was strong, but it also tasted like Folgers..  So overall there are definitely some tasty items but also some misses. If you love cheesecake factory, you will probably love this...otherwise, it's decent.",

He was not too friendly, but to his credit he took the two pastas off the bill (hence +1 star).  UPDATE: I have a suggestion to the chef. If you wish to learn how to cook mussels properly, you might consider doing an internship at Bouchon in the nearby Venetian hotel. And to learn how to prepare asparagus, consider an internship at Julian Serrano at the  Cosmopolitan. I'm sure there are many other places too :)",

I read somewhere that GLC is operated by the Cheesecake Factory - evident through their delicious (and calorically dangerous) desserts. Service was spot-on, courteous without being overbearing or worse, inauthentic. As for the Key Lime Pie, our love was evident in the pie's disappearance within three minutes.  For years, my friends have been memorized by GLC - it seems as though every birthday, empty moment with nothing to do or Strip visit ends at the Grand Lux. For the most part, I agree with them...to a degree.  Service is good, the food is pretty tasty (somewhat overpriced, but hey, it's the Strip).",

Speaking of the menu, there are SO many different choices to be made as I shifted through pages upon pages as if the menu were a small book.

I came here with a friend of mine who was about to move out of Las Vegas and I wanted to go somewhere nice to eat for the both of us. The restaurant was not too hard to find and there was hardly any wait time to sit down at a table. I liked the interior decor of the Grand Lux Cafe, it was elegant but not too overdone. Both of us seemed to enjoy our entrees - I had the Chicken Parmesan and my friend had the Carolina BBQ Pork Sandwich. There were no major complaints from either of us with the food + service.  My Chicken Parmesan was a little more than half done, I guess they weren't kidding about the large portions. =)",

    "text": "Like almost all of the other reviewers said, this place definitely is a sibling of Cheesecake Factory. You can tell by its decor as well as the menu (there were a lot of dishes that were the same from Cheesecake Factory).   Service: Once I walked in, there was a nice ambiance around me, and we were seated immediately. Our waiter was very helpful and made sure we were comfortable with our food and kept checking up on us every so often.  Food: For appetizers, I ordered the spinach dip -- pretty good. I ordered the pasta with chicken, sun-dried tomatoes, and mushrooms, hoping that since this restaurant is from Cheesecake Factory, it would taste the same as the dish I usually order at CF. I was somewhat wrong. The cream sauce Grand Lux uses for that dish has a rather distinct/weird taste, and I didn't like it enough to finish the plate.  I definitely would come here again to try the other dishes. The pricing is pretty decent too. Also, I hear it's open late (although the Grand Lux at The Venetian opens 24 hrs), so that's definitely a plus for people who are dancing the night away and get a little rumble in their stomach. (=",

    "text": "We wanted to go there for lunch but we went the opposite direction from the restaurant. Since we were lost and hungry, we ate at a near by restaurant.  At night, we were at the Venetian for the Blue Man Group. After the show on our way out,  we happened to see a sign with the restaurant name. We got excited and followed the sign until we arrived to the restaurant. As we walked inside, there was a short wait before getting seated. Once we sat down, a friendly waitress greeted us and let us know that the food portions were huge so we should order three main entrees and a salad for four. We had pork ribs, salmon with three different sauces, Mediterranean mahi mahi, and the house vinaigrette salad. While we waited, the bread came out. We mainly ate the insides of the bread since the outer part was too tough. When our food finally arrived, we dug in. The only downside was the mahi mahi which was a little too dry. As for the other three dishes, we enjoyed every bit of it.  The restaurant is huge with plenty of paintings.  The atmosphere is nice and the service is fantastic.  Also, good place to go if you are not in the mood for buffet. Overall, we love the place and will definitely come back when we are in town.",

The bartender even noticed that my hubby and I were waiting forever at the bar and decided to check up on it.  When I brought the burger back upstairs to my suite, the burger was charred on one side.  I had asked that they make the burger medium well.  It was well done and charred.  So I called the manager from my room and asked if they could redo the burger.  When I showed him the burger he said it was suppose to be that way... WTF? Really, so when a customer orders a burger medium well, it is suppose to be burned and crunchy on one side???!!!  Yeah right!   They brought me a new burger and it was better, medium well like I had asked.    One star for inconveniencing me not once, but three times (long wait, burger not cooked to order, and having to make a trip back to get a new burger).  Do not think I will dine here again!",

When we got seated, our hostess asked us if we would like to order from the menu or go straight to the buffet. Being that we got a late start and were hungry, we decided to go with the buffet. Oh boy, was that a big mistake!!! For $18.99 you get a buffet that has less selection than a Homestyle Buffet!!!  Totally not worth it! Was so disappointed and wishes we had just ordered from the menu! To top it off, we had a horrible server who never even cracked a smile..never said hello and just took down our drink order like it was a huge task, not to mention she took a whole 15 minutes to get to us to even take down our order. We had just begun to get our second plates when she abruptly brought us the check. Ok, so you want us to leave already? Lol!! Just gave it a 1 star because the food was decent. Otherwise, horrible selection and poor service. Won't be coming back here for awhile...especially never ever again the breakfast buffet, you can go elsewhere in Vegas that has the same price for a wayyyyy better selection or another place with a cheaper price!",

I consumed a pulled pork sandwich on whole wheat bread which was THE BOMB. Dad got the rachel (pastrami) which he said was \"very good and tender\".   The breakfast buffet rocks. its like $16 a person and they have an omelette station, sausages, bacon, ham, scrambled eggs, assortment of breakfast muffins/pastries, few different cereals (the house made granola and nuts is great), and some oatmeal. Simple, tasty, good, drinks included, very little wait time even on this busy summer weekend.",

I have ordered sundried tomato pasta with grilled chicken, corned beef hash. If you don't want to wait in line, order to go. Save on paying tips.  Their breakfast is always money, and portions are large. I'm a omelet guy so I like how their omelets are made as an egg wrap, with the ingredients stir fried and placed inside the egg.   On my recent trip we found out they had an all you can eat breakfast buffet. That got me so excited because it was cheap @ 15 bucks. It had the omelet bar, waffles, moist scramble eggs, sausages, bacon, fruit bar, and assortment of pastries. Best part about the breakfast was that it came with all you can drink Orange Juice, yes its fresh squeezed. Our waitress was so cool she offered cups of OJ and coffee to take with us. That's what I called service. Because of that this place gets 5 stars for going above and beyond what I expected.",

Baffling. Seriously, I don't get it. The person who created the menu was like... hey, let's put everything in the world you can think of on this bar food menu except for NACHOS! That will be a great trick, we'll show those fatass Americans!  But enough about the asshole who thought it was a good idea to make nachos with an Asian flair, because it wasn't, and that guy is just a douchecanoe.  The only thing I get here is the flatbread chicken sandwich with no cheese. I had it the first time I went and there were no major post-dinner disasters. I'm afraid that if I eat anything else, the disaster in my bathroom will make the BP oil spill seem like a leaky faucet.   Big plus for Sam Adams on draft, but not because that's rare, only because it's my favorite. 3 stars for being completely normal, the menu has enough options to please every single person that walks through the restaurant door.",

We wanted to check out a nearby restaurant that wasn't fine dining but at the same time, a nice sit in place for a group of 10.  This was the perfect place.  Yes... Everything about this place reminds you of Cheesecake Factory, but with better decor!!  It's right downstairs in the Palazzo when you enter its casino from the escalators.  Good spot to hit when you are staying across the street at TI hotel also.  They were very quick to seat us and we were able to sit all together in a booth.  Service was pretty quick since they tried to serve everyone's dishes at the same time.  The place wasn't overly crowded for a lunchtime meal, which was awesome since we were starved.    I ordered the pasta carbonara.  It wasn't too creamy and too thick, which made it a bit lighter.  Not enough bacon pieces or meat though.  Perfect dish to fill your stomach up after a drunking night escapade!  Don't forget!!  There are LUNCH PORTIONS!!!  Lunch portions are more than enough already and comes with a salad!!!  Advice: If you want leftovers, buy something like pizza to keep in the room... Unless you have a penthouse or something that has a microwave. haha!",

The lunch specials (sandwich soup, or salad combos) are really good light and filling.  After eating here a few times and ordering different things, I've come to realize their portion sizes aren't humongous and diabetes inducing anymore. Pastas, Salads, etc. are more decently sized albeit still large for the average person.  Sharing isn't a bad idea still for those that have to eat light before going out at night for whatever reason..lol. The palazzo grand lux is only open until 2AM, the venetian one is open 24 hours.",

So from now on, I'm going to pretend this is not a sister restaurant and move on with my life. This is going to be a repressed thought forever and there's no changing that.   My boyfriend and I arrived in Vegas at almost 10 pm last Friday night after battling traffic nearly the whole way there. So after walking around from restaurant to restaurant on the mall floor of the Venetian that all closed at 10 pm, we were told that downstairs we would find Grand Lux which is open 24/7. We both sort of grumbled and figured we would be dining on fast food and excessive amounts of alcohol to make up for the lack of good cuisine.   Much to our surprise, Grand Lux is actually a really awesome spot. Service was top-notch, our food was fantastic and the margaritas are legit. They're not like lime kool-aid tasting with maybe a hint of tequila. My boyfriend and I are margarita aficionados to the extreme. Actually, I've turned him into a margarita monster and now he orders them at all times, even when they're utterly inappropriate.   For me, I kept within the Mexican theme and ordered the flautas. Holy shit, they're so light and fluffy on the outside yet still have a nice crunch when you bite in them - and the roasted veggies on the inside were cooked to perfection. You know how sometimes roasted veggies turn into mush or amalgamate into something that tastes like burned baby food? Well, not here. They were superb. I don't remember what my boyfriend ate... Not at all. Probably because I was too busy having a mouthgasm over the flautas. Combined with their cadillac margi... Hello, perfection.   When I'm in Vegas again I'll probably be coming here more than once. or more than twice. or maybe just eat here for every meal until I get sick of them. This is probably the best chain I've ever been to.",

And I was pissed I couldn't take it with me, it was that good. Got a nice fruity drink here as well.  Our server was super sweet, very attentive.  Awesome place, especially if you are looking to cut the trip budget a bit.",

We ate the Rock Shrimp, Calamari, Zucchini & Onion appetizer, the Hummus w/bread, & the Warm Rustic Apple Pie ala mode dessert.  ALL good choices.  Even the drinks were good - I had Lemonade, with a sugared rim (yum) & my mom had a White Zinfandel, which she said was better than your average.  We were told by the manager that the apple pie was a little burnt, so we had a choice of having it \"on the house\" or waiting for another one.  We chose the first, since it was late, & it really did not look too bad at all, but wait, let me tell you when we tried it...OMG it was surprisingly good!!  So far, I have never tried anything I didn't like at Grand Luxe - even when they make a mistake - ha ha!",

There is something for everyone, great service and the food is really good. Order a whole bunch of apps and drinks and go crazy!

A little expensive at $15.95 when all they have are fruits, cereals, breads, hash browns, ham, sausage, scrambled eggs, pastries, made to order omelettes, and waffles. Everything is super fresh. I don't actually care for omelettes so I have the omelette guy saute all the yummy stuff I love and throw it on top of the scrambled eggs, finish if off with cheese.Truthfully I don't care for breakfast out unless it's Hawaiian style with mac salad on the side. But Grand Lux always does things better.The servers are always friendly, attentive and thoughtful. Just wish the slots at the Palazzo were friendlier.",

We went with the can't go wrong:  Deluxe Drive in Burger  w/fries at $ 9.50,   a Chicken Burger & salad at $ 11.50 & two sodas.    Never knew a chicken burger could taste so good.   The burger was equally impressive.    Since we visited this place  before,  we knew the food would be good.     Plus the great thing is the price is great,  compared to other hotel restaurants.

The first time I saw this a manager happened to be passing and I inquired if that was the usual practice. He replied \"no\" and had a chat with the bus person. The second time Saturday, January 17, I witnessed this practice in another dining room by another bus person. One must assume this is part of the overall training of the bus help. Personally I find it a nasty practice. Overall, the food is above average. The hashbrowns with my breakfast are greasy though. I wish the restaurant had some sort of ability on their website directly to them.",

The decor was Cheesecake Factory glitzy but we had better food at the Cheesecake Factory in Danvers, MA. last summer. I was really disappointed in the food-flavor of my dish and the tastes I had of my family's. My wife complained (to us) of her food being too salty.  A coke was $3.75 as was some bottled water. We didn't order alcohol and we got out with a $98 tab, including the tip. Not too expensive but not very delicious either. We had a show to catch next door in The Palazzo so we didn't go to Olives at the Bellaggio where we had made a reservation and where last time we had great food. I DON\"T recommend The Grand Lux.",

    "text": "I've been Grand Lux so many times...... not sober.  Chicken & waffle is my usual go to dish late night.  It's a little different from the usual chicken & waffles since the fried chicken is chicken finger and waffles are your thick Belgian waffles.  It doesn't look like much food but trust, it fills you up!     I LOVE their beignets.  Came here for lunch once (the only sober time) and didn't really want the soup & sandwich combo most people were having so decided to just get fat and ordered the beignets.  Thought it would only come with a few pieces but it comes in a basket!  4 different kinds of sauces to change things up, and the chocolate sauce is still the top for me.  Raspberry sauce is a close second since I like the tartness!  It is a great place for breakfast/brunch/lunch and late night.  The menu is huge so it's easy to find something that you'd like.  Not my #1 choice as a dinner spot since there are so many great restaurants around the Strip.  There's actually another Grand Lux at the Venetian but I'm partial to the Palazzo more.  Maybe it's cause it is slightly newer and I am a huge fan of the high ceiling haha.",

The menu is huge with options ranging from breakfast, lunch, dinner to the post party drunken stupor meal. Pricing is relatively reasonable and almost anyone can score themselves a filling plate, with leftovers even.  We came in for brunch, and I got your standard eggs, bacon and hashbrowns with toast platter. Huuuuuge portions. The bacon is thick, and cooked to a crisp. So were the hashbrowns. Three eggs done right and the toast which you forget about because your too busy stuffing your face with everything else.  The staff is friendly although you may have to wait a bit for service.   Do ask for a basket of bread to start. Absolutely delish. Warm, doughy with an extra slathering of butter.",

    "text": "DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME COMING HERE. Decided at about 1130pm that some late night eats would do the trick to top off our fun evening. We looked up reviews and even skipped a bunch of places on the strip in search of a good sit down meal and walked here all the way from The Cosmo with high hopes...let's just say those hopes were shot down, kicked, and stomped on. Violently. The fact that they have good reviews is baffling. I admit it was after some drinks, but I actually wish I was more drunk so that I didn't notice the terrible food and service. The front hostesses were helpful in seating us, but it was in a darker corner away from any foot traffic of servers, and it wasn't even that busy...mind you, there were only two of us. Our server, Jesus Jimenez took awhile to greet us and took even longer to take our orders. I don't eat meat so when I asked him if there were any other options besides the fish and chips and pricey salads he just responded, \"no\". I wasn't looking for a gourmet option, but at least show some empathy. Little do I know, that would be the least of our problems. Right when we were going to get up and leave he finally came without any apologies. Like, can I get some bread or something to hold us over? Nada. Fine, just give us our food. 30 minutes later I had wish we did ask for bread. When the food came, it was a poor excuse of jambalaya that looked like a college kid had made it and questionable ahi tuna that I probably should not have ingested, but we were so hungry at that point, we ate it anyway. After the meal, it took another 30 minutes for someone to check on us, so by that time we just wanted our bill and get the hell out of there. Just when we thought we were free of the terrible service, there was more. Our server informed us as we were handing over our card to pay that the system was down and that we needed to go to the ATM. Why would you wait until after all the waiting to tell us this?! The temptation of dining and ditching sounded so amazing at that point, but I was too sober to get myself to do it- probably due to the adrenalin and anger of our horrible dining experience.  So, if you're looking for somewhere to go for some late night eats, go somewhere else. You're better off grabbing some Earl of Sandwich and calling it a night. The service is terrible and the food is worse...unless you're looking for somewhere to sober up immediately, then this is the place to go.",

I give it 3 stars overall.  3 stars because I've been to the Grand Lux Cafe at Venetian (as opposed to this one, at Palazzo), and enjoyed it much more.  It was much more lively and inviting.  The one here at Palazzo made it feel like it was in a dark forgotten corner of the Casino, which I did not enjoy at all.  Also this may probably be my own fault, but having been seated at a booth made it just feel like a cheap diner.    I got the salmon, which was actually quite delightful, but the entire experience was kind of just bogged down by the rest of the environment.  I love cheesecake (which is the lesser GLC) and I love Grand Lux at the Venetian, but I most likely won't be coming back to this one at Palazzo again.",

I paid for coffee, never got to order lunch. Too hungry went elsewhere.  Today at 10:00 this morning we were immediately seated in a very busy restaurant. Our waitress took our order and shortly thereafter brought us cold cups of coffee. These were replaced with hot coffees. My wife opted for the buffet. I ordered the Chillaquiles. Which end arrived after about 30 minutes. These too were cold (scrambled eggs cooked with tortillas). No hot sauce was offered. My waitress took them back and said a new order would be placed.  Half an hour now passes and the waitress returns telling me that my breakfast is still not ready. At this point I informed her I was leaving.  This has to go down as the worst restaurant experience of the year. Management is to blame for this restaurants poor customer service. They need a shakeup.   The Grand Lux used to be a good experience. I do not recommend you eat there. There are better choices.",

    "text": "This is the second Grand Lux I've been to in Vegas, which is a little funny because I never really go to the one in L.A.  I guess it makes sense if you think about it - so many of the restaurants in Vegas require some major spending, and it's hard to justify eating out like a baller for every meal.  Besides, sometimes you just want to get a simple lunch where you can walk down in normal clothes with a hangover clear on your face.  L.A. has lots of options for that; the Palazzo has Grand Lux.  I came here for just such a lunch with seven of my girlfriends during my bachelorette weekend.  We arrived around two o'clock and got seated right away.  Service was pretty slow, considering, but it was polite enough, and we weren't in a terrible hurry.  The interior - eh, I won't bother describing it.  If you're looking to eat at Grand Lux, chances are you've been to a Cheesecake Factory.  Same idea.  I shared a Sonoma salad with Melissa K., my maid of honor.  Decent salad, big enough to share, with crispy greens, grilled chicken, avocado, bacon, fresh corn, sweet dates, golden raisins, onions, goat cheese, and glazed walnuts.  We got the hazelnut-mustard vinaigrette on the side.  I swapped a bit with June K. who ordered the seared rare ahi tuna salad.  This one came with romaine, radicchio, frisee, and avocado, tossed with a vinaigrette and piled high with seared ahi.  The tuna was pretty good.  If I come back to Grand Lux I might go for that one next time.  Lunch was nice and light, which was good - the rest of the itinerary included pool time, dinner, and club time, during which I would have to wear both a swimsuit and a dress I needed help getting into.  Grand Lux Cafe wasn't the most eventful part of the weekend, but it was a serviceable restaurant.  I'm glad it was an available option.",

I had a wonderful server, she let me pack up a to go box from the buffet to bring to my kids that were still sleeping in our rooms upstairs.  Service here is great, little touches that I didn't expect, like my napkin getting folded into a nice triangle every time I left for more from the buffet.  Well recommended and much more worth the price when I think about how disappointing Wicked Spoon was.",

    "text": "Having stayed at the Palazzo, and after a few nights out late at XS and Marquee, being able to come back to the resort, and having the Grand Lux Cafe open at 6am was a god-send. I think the only bad thing is that it closes from 2am-6am daily, but for me, heading back to my room each morning around 6am, it was perfect.  I am well aware they have the $18.95 breakfast buffet, but as far as myself, none of the food on their buffet appeals to me, and so both the mornings I decided to get a late night cap, I went for the Chicken & Waffles combo one morning, and the next morning I went for the Caramel Banana-Nut French Toast.  I am from LA, so I am spoiled by the original Roscoe's as far as Chicken & Waffles. I prefer my chicken with bone, not boneless tenders; and that's what you get here at the Grand Lux Cafe-- Chicken tenders & Waffles. Granted, at 6am, after a long night of drinking and partying, anything warm/hot will do you good, but like I said, I was expecting an actual piece of chicken breast and a wing, or something of the sort. The chicken was alright, and the waffle was great.   The second time I visited the Grand Lux, I ordered the Caramel Banana-Nut French Toast. Man, I don't know their toast recipe, but boy was it finger lickin' good! The portions, as has been mentioned on here, are HUGE! So huge that I wasn't able to finish either of the breakfast items I ordered, but especially not the French Toast. This is some super large and thick toast, not like your home-made variety. I must say, the toast, with the caramel and the nuts made this by far one of the best meals I had in my five day trip to Las Vegas.  This was my first time staying at the Palazzo, and thus the first time I ever bothered with the Grand Lux. I've already booked at the Palazzo again for September, and already know what I'll be ordering when I'm back!",

My favorites are definitely the eggplant fritters (loved them so much I learned to make them at home). Also, the beignets, the crown jewel. I STRONGLY recommend the beignets. Light and warm, served with chocolate,  raspberry,  and a whiskey sauce (aka creme anglaise w ith liquor). Its to die for.",

I was hungry for Waffles, so I knew what I wanted ahead of time.  However, after browsing the menu, I decided to add an order of Beignets as well.  When I think of Beignets, I think of the light, powdered sugar Doughnuts in New Orleans.  I was in for a big surprise when the server brought out the order....  Beignets, $7.95 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-5?select=k3qwl979nu3K0smXiMGhNg#k3qwl979nu3K0smXiMGhNg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gran...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-5?select=SrtObgQ_8dSJKMBfZopbFA#SrtObgQ_8dSJKMBfZopbFA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gran...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-5?select=Xxth4L2hZfG1WhlCh8yVZw#Xxth4L2hZfG1WhlCh8yVZw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gran...</a>  Belgian Waffle, $8.95 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-5?select=aye9-4Y9ypMy4uSgu5_pFw#aye9-4Y9ypMy4uSgu5_pFw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gran...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-5?select=HxHvL4-uNZryft320GOUmQ#HxHvL4-uNZryft320GOUmQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gran...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grand-lux-cafe-las-vegas-5?select=gIQX6_qfBQv6c7bA0OH6FA#gIQX6_qfBQv6c7bA0OH6FA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gran...</a>  Coffee, $3.95  The Beignets is actually a bowl of 10+ Doughnuts that are encrusted with Sugar....they're very good, but heavier and more rich than the type they serve at Cafe du Monde (New Orleans).  After having one of these, I decided to eat my Waffle first, so I could satisfy that urge.  The Waffle was very good.  After that, I was only able to eat 3 more Beignets before I had to cry uncle and give up....it was too much for me to handle by myself....LOL  They were tasty, just too large of a portion.    The Coffee didn't help balance the sweet taste of my breakfast.  It wasn't worth $3.95....it was actually terrible and tasted like Folgers...yuck.  Save your money and buy Coffee elsewhere.  Overall, the breakfast was pretty good.  I like it better than lunch and dinner menu items here.....so I'm raising it to 4 Stars from 3 for that.  Next time, I will bring my Wife or a guest to help with the Beignets.  Return Factor - 75% (breakfast only)",

We were greeted by a very upbeat waiter, which was very pleasing. There was a 6 minute wait for our drinks, and a 15 minute wait for our food. I ordered the Chicken Angeli (in which the waiter said that it was his favorite), and my friend ordered the pierogies. It was really worth the wait since the food was flawless, and the prices were reasonable.    We didn't order any dessert since we went to ILLY (also in Palazzo) for some affogatos. As for our drinks, we ordered the Berry Fizz, which is 3 types of berries blended with Sprite. It looked good, and it was very tasty. Even two other women sitting at a table next to us saw our drinks and asked us what they were.   You'll have to walk through some gambling areas to get to this place, as it is not in the \"shopping mall\" area. If you want to go to a nice restaurant without spending a fortune, then I highly recommend coming here. Oh, and this restaurant is owned by The Cheesecake Factory.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "4 1/2 stars.  Came here for breakfast, so this review is based on breakfast only.   My friend kept telling me how their beignets were out of this world so I just had to stop by and check it out. There are 2 Grand Lux cafe's at the Palazzo so make sure to come to this because the other one does not have beignets.  _Strawberry Belgian Waffles, were amazing and great in size. Surprisingly it's hard to find a good Belgian waffle. Either its too dense, flaky, mushy, whatever it may be this place had it down! perfect amount of crisp and nice and soft inside. The strawberries were fresh as well. _Lox and Cream cheese, I was surprised at how fresh the smoked salmon were. The bagel and cream cheese topped with salmon, red onions and cucumber was just the perfect bite. MMMMM sounds good right now! _Fresh Garden Omelette. Was big in portion and just what I had in mind. I asked for egg whites instead. Comes with toast and hash browns. All the vegetables were cooked well and a good ratio as well. _Beignets..... H.E.A.V.E.N! everything I thought it would be and more. Comes in 8 which is more than enough. Good size and so warm. You must eat it right when it comes out. It tastes best warm, as soon as it gets cooler it does not taste the same. Still great but not as good as the beginning. My first bite was orgasmic! comes with 4 sides, syrup, ground cinnamon, condensed milk, and strawberry jam I think. I just kept dipping and eating I did not realize I had eaten 6! had a bit of a stomach ache but it was damn worth it!! I like it dipped with the condensed milk, or the jam with cinnamon! the beignets itself was so moist, fluffy and light you don't even need the sauces.   Carb and sugar overload but one of the best breakfasts I've had. Their coffee was actually quite good as well.",

Not that it's a bad thing...  Same thing happens here with the menu...there's so much variety that you find yourself flipping through the 392 pages still trying to narrow down your choices.   Because NO hotel in Vegas has microwaves to rehash leftovers later, Grand Lux is a great place to split. The boyfriend had so much Carbonara pasta leftover that it could definitely feed another person. Definitely good, but GREASY. Same goes for my Caramel Chicken. Had we known things would be circus-sized, we would have split. The prices might sticker shock you, but they're fair given the portion sizes!  Treat yourself to a Macchiato here. The whipped cream alone is totally worth it. How the hell do they get cream whipped so firm and delicious?",

I usually sit at the bar and have always had great meals there.    It's strange though, the Grand Lux at The Venetian, which is open 24 hours a day, isn't even close to as good.  I can't figure out why.  Maybe the 24 hour operation drains the spirit out of the workers.  Who knows.  At the Palazzo location, however, If you get the Linguine with Clams and pay an extra three bucks for the shrimp you have a $19.95 plate of pasta that is downright awesome.  The Corn Beef Hash and a Sam Adams is the time tested and purest way to kick any of the previous nights activities out of the loop and make you feel like sunshine.  They've got some version of the Molten Chocolate Cake that is grand.  It's take 20 minutes so be aware.  One word to the wise, their dishwasher leaves some kind of film that affects the taste of the draft beer.  The bartenders are aware of it and try to rinse the glasses before serving, but it slips their mind sometimes.  Other than that, I have nothing but good things to say about this location of Grand Lux.",

There is usually a line to get seated, but it goes by quick.",

    "text": "Cheesecake Factory like menu, but much better quality! Apparently it's like Banana Republic to Old Navy but for restaurants. I know it's a chain restaurant so sue me for giving them a 5 star review! There were 7 of us here for dinner so you know the service charge was in effect! Those lucky servers! LOL! I usually stick to a handful of menu items, but you can't really go wrong with anything on the menu. I usually order the crispy caramel chicken, Indochine chicken and shrimp, fish n chips, jambalaya or any of their salads. Their prices are really reasonable too!  I happened to order the Southwestern chicken salad which included chicken, lettuce, avocado, black bean, corn, crispy tortilla strips, tomatoes, a few other goodies along with a lime vinaigrette. The salad was super fresh and was really tasty!   I always ate here before and will keep doing so as long as the quality of service and food are at this high of a level! I hope that they don't drop in quality like the Cheesecake Factory has in the last few years.",

I ordered the veggie pizza which might very well be the best veggie pizza I've ever had. The crust was soft yet crunchy on the bottom. The grilled veggies on top were amazing. All the flavors were amazing on the pizza. I think it was only $13. I had like 4 slices to take home after eating 4 in the restaurant.   We went back a second time and got mashed potato stuff eggrolls for appetizer. They were pretty good but they needed something more. Maybe the bacon since we ordered it without. I was craving asian food and got the zen noodles thinking it was a stir fry. Turned out to be a makeshift version of pho. Not good. A miss with that one. But I'm still stuck on the amazing pizza so I forgive them for the noodles. My bf ate a burger which he said was really good.   This place is also 24 hrs. Amazing ambiance, price, and food for Vegas! Watch out for crazy drunks at night.",

However, while I consumed compressed turkey loaf on Thanksgiving, I realized how you just don't know what kind of service or food you are going to get at this place.    One waitress was awesome, one waiter vanished into thin air for most of our visit, one was a crabby old lady who berated me for asking what was the soup of the day after I gave her my drink order when my husband hadn't given his drink order yet.  Yelling at me then wasn't enough, she continued to humiliate and belittle me through the rest of our meal.  Our whole party was astonished at her rudeness.  It's actually a great place to eat, I just downgraded my review because I have had such a mixed bag of experiences while dining there.  In general, it's good and I would go again, but I could go for more consistency.",

I had two meals there while staying at the Palazzo because something as simple as their burgers/sandwiches were amazingly good.  It's a little on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for.    -Regular Burger with 3 toppings ($14) - they cooked it medium rare just the way I had asked, and the burger was insanely big.  It came with fries and everyhing which made it hard to even finish such a giant burger.  I had asked for cheese, avocado, and mushroom...now how can that not be an amazing burger just already.  -Short Rib Sandwich ($16?) - There's a reason why there were two of us ordered the same exact thing.  It looked damn good on the menu and we didn't want to share.  And just as suspected, it was great.  Greasy, yes, but the toasty bread sandwiching short rib meat was phenomenal.    -Knowing this type of food exists around the strip, I'm glad to say I'll be looking forward to staying somewhere nearby next time I'm in vegas too.  btw, NO TO Imperial Palace",

    "text": "I adore Grand Luxe. It is one of my favorite restaurants in Los Angeles and one of my favorites in Las Vegas. I was very surprised that they opened one at the Palazzo, since they have one in the Venetian which is less than a 5 minute walk.   But regardless, my boyfriend and I havent' been to Grand Luxe in a long time and so we decided to go and have dinner there. We parked at the Venetian and upon entering the Venetian we saw a HUGE line at Grand Luxe. I hate waiting for a long period of time, especially just to eat. So I said, let's go try the one at the Palazzo. I was hoping not many people knew about the second location. I was semi-right!!!  When we walked towards the Grand Luxe location at the Palazzo, there were only 2 people in front of me. Once I gave them the number of my party, they sat us immediately. SCORE! No wait! I was a very happy camper indeed.  I ordered my usual Sunday Night Pasta. It was delicious. Slightly a bit too salty for my taste, but still good as I remember it to be. My boyfriend ordered the Lasagna and he LOVED it. I think it is his new favorite item on their menu. He just loved the sauce. I tried it and it was delicious!   Although we were stuffed, we saved room for dessert because I am a HUGE Creme Brulee fanatic and hadn't had it in such a long time. So we ordered that and it was also delicious. You get one regular vanilla creme brulee and one chocolate flavored creme brulee. When you eat it together, it's just so yummy in your tummy!!  Our waiter was also very nice and helpful. So service was good too.  I love Grand Luxe!! I had so much leftovers. Portion size is HUGE! So many choices and so much good food!!!",

Food: I ordered the Sunday Night Pasta and it was excellent. It may seem like a ripoff since it's 17.50 for spaghetti with meat sauce but it was totally worth it. The meat sauce was so flavorful, it's made with chunks of beef short ribs and steak. Even after I was full, I wanted to keep eating to finish the rest of it.   What I didn't like was that despite the fact the restaurant wasn't that busy, for some reason the food took forever to come out or what felt like forever.",

Pretty basic omelette section, hashbrkwns, sausage, fruit, ham, cereal, bread & pastry selection. I noticed it was quite busy & i truthfully have no complaints for a last minute $20 breakfast buffet. On a separate note, but in the same day I stopped in for dinner & a couple drinks. I ordered the mini brie and date pizza which was literally exquisite! The buttery, flaky crust complimented the tangy nuttiness of the brie and the sweetness of the dates so well. I enjoyed an heirloom and avocado salad that was so rich in flavor and texture. The heirlooms were slightly acidic and paired perfectly with creamy avocado and robust french dressing! I even indulged in a couple mai tais that completed my meal perfectly. I sat at the bar and was greeted by Joey. He was extremely friendly and attentive, i would have to say food and service here was awesome!",

I wasn't curious enough to try, so I ended up ordered the next familiar thing: indochine chicken and shrimp! it was yummy and came with brown rice. I highly recommend the asian nachos.

It was just HUGE for the price (earlier in the day I paid $5 for a crappy hot dog somewhere else so this dish and price was thrilling).

Or just simply sick and tired of looking at all the food stations with endless possibilities for a potential food coma? (Well I never had that problem but people in my party certainly had that predicament)  So I guess I will just have to follow suit and take in a regular dining facility instead of the glamorous world of buffet heaven.  I've been to a Grand Lux before so it wasn't anything new to me.   It is the sister restaurant of Cheesecake Factory's therefore I have no complaints here at all.  Just like any Cheesecake's you've been to it's got lavish decor, dim lighting, and of course, endless options on their menu.  It's a typical California (cheesecake factory) fare where you can pretty much get anything and everything.. so here are the dishes that our party have ordered!  Polynesian Salad!  Citrusy flavored dressing with a hint of sweetness all rolled into one drizzled upon a pyramid like salad concoction.  The veggie temple was build with a foundation of mixed greens and tiered off by giant wonton crisps!  It's pretty much the sister version of the Luau Salad at the Cheesecake factory... one of the most delicious salads for a nice sit down restaurant!  Grand Cobb Salad:  It's grand but actually not as large portioned as the Polynesian salad.  It's got all your typical culprits in a cobb (avocado, bacon, turkey, egg whites, etc..) All dressed in bleu cheese!  (I thought it was ranch..  Yuck!  I hate Blue Cheese!!!  However, when I actually gave it a try, the dressing as actually tasty and bearable!  (I simply cannot handle bleu cheese) So that's actually tasty as well!  Madeira Chicken:  Didn't get to try this out but according to our friends, it was tasty!  (I'm not a big chicken breast dish kind of guy so I never order these things)  I'll just take their word for it!  Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich:  Same as above as I didn't get to try the sammy, but it was gone from my buddy's plate so that's a good sign!  Gotta try that next time!  Slow Roasted Short Ribs of Beef:  Great BBQ flavor!  It's your typical BBQ flavor dish but definitely tasty!  (With BBQ you really cannot go wrong unless you overcook it which will make it super dry and gross)  But it was nicely flavored, juicy, and delicious overall!  (huge portion too! as it was served with veggies and mash Potato!)  Fried Calamari:  Highlight alert!  This is one of the best Calamari that I've ever had in many different places!  They fried their calamari along with veggies and rock shrimp to create the most heavenly dish (one of my all time favorites!) served with ranch and spicy aioli dressing!  I'm telling you, if you were to pick one dish to get at Grand Lux, this one is highly highly recommended!  Oh... did I mention the portion for this is huge?  Well you bet it is!  Totally worth every penny!  Lastly, service was awesome as it comes to expected being affiliated with cheesecake Factory.  They brought out wrong salad dressing for me and when I asked for it, 2 different wait staff came out with the dressing!  (Now I got 3!)  Great attention to customer's needs is definitely a plus!  So there you have it, Grand Lux Cafe, opens 24 hrs, in Venetian or Palazzo, and will serve your morning, noon, dinner, or late night dining needs in case you are totally turned off by the buffets of  Vegas!  A terrific alternative yet decently priced!",

Usually when I order omelettes at other restaurants, the ingredients inside do not fill up the whole thing, but every bite of my omelette here was filled with all the yummy goodness!!! The salmon was alright... a bit overcooked, but the sandwiches were deeeelicious as well! Overall, YUMMY!!! ^_^",

I won't really go into details for the simple reason that you will definitely find something you would like [they literally have dishes of every kind of popular food]. It's also conveniently located next to the Casino at the Venetian so you can grub and gamble or gamble and grub.   The staff is super friendly, the atmosphere is romantic and trendy and the bill isn't as over the top as you may think. So go ahead and enjoy! I highly recommend it!",

Not much of a waiting area, so we kinda stood around in the bar area.  (That is why one fewer star.)  We were seated and our waiter was on point.  He had great recommendations.  He kept my glasses full.   He helped us navigate out of the place.  Separate checks, no problem!   Special requests, sure thing!  It was super late for me to eat dinner, so I thought, I will get something on the lighter and smaller side.   Grand Lux Cafe thought otherwise.  My mini pizza was enormous.   The small chopped salad would have been an entree on its own.   The salad was delicious and had a great presentation.  My pizza was perfectly cooked.    Prices were reasonable, especially considering the portions.   Service was excellent.   Atmosphere was kinda funky, but I liked it.     I would head back here!",

    "text": "There are two Lux Cafe's with one each located in both, The Venetian and The Palazzo.  This review is for the Palazzo location.    First thing you will notice is an extensive menu which was created by the Founder of Cheesecake Factory, so if you have ever eaten at one of those you know what I'm taking about.  The menu gets 5 stars.   I would rate the food here as being in the 3 star to 5 star range depending on what you order.  The breakfast omelets are excellent as are the burgers, wraps and many of the sandwiches I have tried.  Things like the pancakes were average and nothing to write home about.    The service was a bit off the last two visits with me having to flag down a server to get coffee, creamer, water refills and even simple stuff like ketchup.  Despite that the food and meal was still good.    Overall this is a great place to \"grab a bite\" or perhaps also a drink as they do have a full bar.  However, this isn't a romantic experience or even a \"real nice\" dining experience that will be memorable for years.  This is a casual \"fill my stomach\" experience.   For something more, look to some of the 5 star rated restaurants I reviewed.    Enjoy!",

I just hate all the indoor smoking of Las Vegas!   Our waitress, Victoria, was wonderful!   She was so attentive, polite and professional.  Awesome service!    I had the Lemon Drop Martini which was perfectly sweet and had just the right amount of alcohol.    We ordered the fried calamari which included shrimp and some veggies.  A very generous serving accompanied by 2 dipping sauces.   The batter was not too thin nor too thick.  It wasn't greasy and was very tasty.    We also ordered the cheese and BBQ chicken pizza.  I didn't get to try it but it was all gone so need I say more?  Hubby and I shared the Beef Wellington.  We've never had this dish anywhere and were so used to seeing it prepared on Gordon Ramsey's Hell's Kitchen, so when they came out as medallions with a pastry puff sitting on top, we were a little disappointed but they were still really delicious!   I'm not a brussel sprouts eater but I loved the way they were prepared!  It was charred and topped with a sweet glaze.  Veggies and mashed potatoes were paired with it.    No room for dessert but I'd love to come back!",

They're light and fluffy and made to Perfection. You have to order this wonderful dessert when you sit down because it takes about 30 minutes for it to be made from scratch. Otherwise the menu is vast just like their mother company The Cheesecake Factory. Most of the dishes are great but there are some misses. For example, I had a really great hamburger from the Grand Lux when they were in Los Angeles (unfortunately they're closed now) but when I ordered a hamburger, in all fairness it was not the same hamburger, from the Grand Lux at the Palazzo it was a miss; I actually had to send it back. But that is a rarity and the customer service is so good that if you do get something you don't like they'll be happy to give you something else. There is more than one location of the Grand Lux in Las Vegas but the one I tend to frequent the most is the one at the casino the Bellagio next to the Venetian. The Venetian is cool but it doesn't seem to have as much going on for it as the one at the Palazzo. This is also a really great restaurant to go to with your family because they have the ability to accommodate a large group. The bar is cool to have your dining experience because it's a good people watching environment and you can watch television as well but it is dark in there. If you want a more bright environment then you'll not want to sit in the bar. We don't mind the bar because my husband enjoys watching sports while we're dining so it's cool for us but at least you'll have options going in. Have a great time at the Grand Lux with its vast menu and amazing desserts you can't go wrong here!",

Usually, I'm concerned about places like these because I like to eat at a restaurant that specializes in 1 or 2 items. However, Grand Lux pulls it off.  I got the Cajun Shrimp and Chicken Jambalaya and it was huge! There was plenty of shrimp and chicken and I didn't feel like I was getting skimped of the good stuff. The spices were nicely marinated and had a nice little kick to it. I was definitely satisfied. I feel like Grand Lux gives you the appropriate portion size for the amount you pay. If you think the price is too steep, just remember that the portions are going to be big so you can definitely share/to-go it.   The service was exceptional. The hostesses sat us down right away and Pierre, our waiter, was the man. He was very friendly and gave us honest suggestions on the menu (since it's too big!). He was very prompt and courteous.   My only knock on this location vs the one at the Venetian is that this one isn't open 24/7. But then again, when am I going to eat at 4 AM in the morning? Only in Vegas...",

Portions are big.  3. Service is great.  4. Sofa and booths are comfy.  5. Windows on the north side provide sun and day light which is very nice (unlike the venetian location when you have no windows). 6. Affordable.   I usually go with: * Chicken avocado salads!  * Caramel chicken (kind of a orange chicken). * Omelets. * Smoked salmon scrambled.  Yummy and solid!  Great spot for a quick non formal and casual meal- breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Trust me, I know food.",

    "text": "Hmm, my 5 star rating is a little skewed mostly because I've had a lot of good times at Grand Lux! Drunken and non-drunken times! LOL  The best thing I love about this place is the huge menu and the price that they offer it at! I usually love short menu's because you know the restaurant does a few thing but they do it well but this is exact opposite! They have a huge menu and they do most things relatively well!   The chicken and waffles here is a must! The chicken flatbread i tried was great too! There serving sizes are bigger and the prices are reasonable. I think this is a solid dependable place to eat at any time of the day.  When in doubt where to eat, go to the LUX!",

The restaurant is a sister restaurant to the Cheese Cake Factory so all of the portion sizes were HUGE and can easily feed two people. We had the biscuits and gravy which was great and the buffet. The buffet is the way to go, at $20 it includes coffee (which is $4 on its own) and the omelette bar was a nice surprise.   Over all it was a good breakfast and we ate there for breakfast all 3 days we were in town!",

My boyfriend told me one of the locations has the fried beignets and it was a must have item.  so we tried to see which location has it.  so he asked and turned out it was in the Palazoo side and we had dinner here.  We shared the appetizer, entree, and dessert.  Portion size was huge, so glad we shared, or else we would have lots of left over.   We shared the pot roast fries, garlic shrimp pasta, and fried beignets.  OMG they were all so delicious.  out of the 3, I really enjoy the fries and the beignets, i would get them again when I go there again.    the pot roast fries: pot roast was super tender and tasty.  the fries were fried in perfection.  I was surprised it was loaded with lots of meat and we got kinda full from the appetizer already.    Garlic Shrimp Pasta: was very good, not super garlicky and it was just right amount of garlic flavor.  portion was huge and right amount of shrimp too.  Fried Beignets: delicious and melt in your mouth.  Love our server brought all 3 dipping sauce for us to try since we can't decided what sauce to use.  really like the white cream sauce and chocolate, not too much on the raspberry one.  will get this again.    service: great.  server was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu.   atmosphere: very romantic.  we were sitting outside facing the mall and it was nice actually.",

BF got the beef wellington which overall was okay.. except the last piece (which I asked to try) was so soft it was obviously really old (bad) meat?  It was like.. mushier and softer than a hamburger patty, and had no texture hold at all...  Gross.  I got the BLT with sweet potatoes which was good.. so filling that I ended up taking half of it to go (yay, leftovers).  They provide some pretty delicious fresh sourdough bread and butter while you wait (you might have to ask for it).  Our waiter was slammed but managed to get through the service.  Overall a good place to chow down for a bite to eat.. was a little disappointed we missed breakfast since it took so long to get seated.  C'est la vie.",

It's unmistakable.  Portion sizes are generous, three mains and a salad and an appetizer were enough to feed six adults. Everything we ordered was delicious and recommended to try!  Eggplant parmesan fritters - great eggplant flavor, deep fried to perfection and goes perfectly with the marinara sauce  Crispy fish tacos - lives up to its name, fish remained crispy even when we waited to eat them last. The sauce adds a nice kick  Cafe beef wellington - my personal favorite. A unique take on beef wellington, it's not beef wrapped in puff pastry, but rather of puff pastry  on top of beef medallions. Beef was amazingly tender, mashed potatoes were buttery and the veggies were delicious. The brussel sprouts were surprisingly everyone's favorite!  Roasted Pear and Strawberry Salad - great combination of flavors, if there's any salad to try here, get this one  Sausage, Pepperoni & Mushrooms Pizza - a long flatbread style pizza, pizza sauce is light and flavorful, crust was good  If you like The Cheesecake Factory, you'll enjoy it here as well, especially if you're staying at the Palazzo.",

Sometimes the breakfast foods are on the lunch menu if you don't wake up early enough.    There's so much seating in here that you should get a table within 30-40 minutes in my opinion.  I found out they offer a buffet brunch option until 3 pm for $24.95.  You don't even have to sit near the buffet, and not everyone in your group needs to get this option.  It's worth it if you want to try a bit of everything.    Service is good - Vegas style.  I know I'll be back!",

The mushrooms really stood out, which I enjoyed as a mushroom lover. Dad had a thai egg roll type dish that none of us could get enough of. The flavors were fresh and complex.

We decided if we didn't Make finish with enough time we'd catch a later flight. Best idea yet cause that gave us enough time to walk over to the Palazzo to try the pancakes. It was nice to Walk right in and be seated. After reviewing the menu fully I was a little bummed at first that there was no banana pancakes on the menu but the waitress assured us that the Lemon Poppyseed were her favorite and were Delicious. It only took one bite to realize that the Lemon Poppyseed pancakes were absolutely delicious and absolutely what i was looking for. The service was great, the setting was great and the food was delicious. I will definitely be back to try the waffles!!",

    "text": "I wish I could give it 10 stars!  The breakfast buffet is AMAZING and definitely the best breakfast we had during our trip. Initially we didn't want to do any buffets while visiting but when the belly calls, it calls.   The food consists of traditional buffet fare (waffles, hashbrowns, breakfast meats, omelette station, fresh cut fruit, pastries, oatmeal, bagels/toast, perfectly rounded scoops of butter and cream cheese etc.) and I was most surprised by the hashbrowns. I've seen some gross/oily hashbrowns before and these were nothing like that. The potatoes are grated fresh everyday and cooked to tender and crisp perfection. The little waffles have a good crisp to them and their  perfect size helps reduce food waste.   The highlight for me is definitely the omelette and fresh fruit. Loaded with both chopped veggies and fresh greens it was the tastiest I've had in a while. The fresh fruit was vibrant and consisted of a wonderful assortment of berries, melons, grapes, etc.  I saved the best for last: the coffee and OJ. The coffee made me want to get a pot to go. 3 sips were not enough. I didn't ask what type/brand they brew bcz I didn't trust myself to not go on the hunt while the belly is still occupied. I literally snuck a fourth sip (shhhhh) when my coffee nazi wasn't watching. Try it. You won't be disappointed. And OJ is made from fresh squeezed Chilean fukomoto oranges and reminds me of Valencia oranges. It's absolutely delectable.   Great service with a smile and at only $20 per person this is, hands down, the best breakfast on the strip!",

I don't eat french toast often but I could not help but take a couple bites out of it. It is really fluffy and good. They have a buffet but we chose not to get it because we are not going to eat to much, but it seemed to have a lot of options from the menu that you could've tried it all. I would definitely come back here again.",

Most places seem to close at 10:00 PM but this place is open till 2AM or 3AM depending on day.   We ordered a late dinner after watching O. Salmon trio which had three different types of salmon and also poke tacos.   There wasn't that many people at the restaurant so the service was really nice. Overall I liked the many options they had for a late dinner.   Tip- If your trying to figure out a place that is open a little later this is a pretty tasty spot with plenty of food options.

Oh and by the way we have a limited menu because or stove or something Is wrong so you can't order burgers or anything that goes on the grill? Well then.. That's how I landed at the palazzo location and I'm sure glad I have them a try! It's a more smaller location with the same full menu and great service!

I ordered the Rachel, a really great pastrami sandwich with coleslaw. The other dishes my party ordered all looked huge but nothing stood out quite like the chicken potpie. Huge chunks of veggies and protein, a perfectly baked crust, and a tasty, creamy inside... what's there not to like?!?

Everyhting is great...our favorites include the brie wontons, pot roast fries, Asian short rib tacos, all the salads, especially the manhattan & cobb. The burgers are great, kobe meatballs are fantastic! Truth is, I can't imagine anything not being good. When our family visits they beg us to take us there. Service is always great and Jeremy wrote Happy Birthday to my husband in strawberry syrup on our warm butter cake dessert!   Oh and yes they are owned by the Cheesecake Factory, but that does not mean they are anything alike...as a matter of fact, we strongly dislike the Cheesecake Factory and can't recall having a decent meal there--ever.

My favorite tapas are the Asian Short Rib Tacos and the BBQ Pork Sliders.  The Grand Lux burger melt and avocado chipotle cheeseburger are delicious!  There are other dishes on the menu that we've had, and we have never been disappointed with any of the choices.   Make sure to save room for dessert.  Our favorite is the New Orleans beignets which comes with three different dipping sauces (chocolate, vanilla, and raspberry).  Order the beignets when you give your entree order cause it takes about 30 minutes to make the beignets.  They are a bit pricey, but worth it and the staff is usually good also.

The first time, I split a penne pasta dish with my best friend. It was tasty--excellent recipe. The second time, I split the mushroom burger with my mom. Even better. They combined four types of mushrooms and made a veggie patty out of it. It was a little messy, but totally worth it. We also enjoyed a fruit smoothie, which was fancy and delicious.  Notice a pattern? The portions are pretty generous, so you might want to split an entree if you don't want to take leftovers home. The hostesses and servers are very professional.   Love it!

I ordered the Chicken and Waffles (per a fellow Yelper's recommendation and the fact that I thought this is an easy meal to make).   My friend's $34 steak was so gross. Dry, fatty and tough.  My chicken was breaded chicken tenders. I had one. Gross. The waffle was average and served with sprinkled pecans but something I feel could have been cooked up at IHOP.   My other friend thought it was great. He also only eats at Fast Food restuarants and American food only.  The only upside: Our cute waiter Rudy Morales. Really nice.

Moving onto entrees we ordered the chicken and braised short rib combination, spaghettini with clams, house chicken salad and the lasagna.   #1 chicken was good, but braised short rib was a little too salty to my liking! (surprisingly) #2 Spaghettini with clams was best bang for the bucks! Little bit of noodles and CRAP load of clams #3 house chicken salad was drenched in dressing, not a big fan.  #4 Lasagna........?????? must of been good because my boy ate every last bite of it without sharing!

My wife is bi-lingual and therefore understands English and Spanish.  Our waitress didn't think anyone around her spoke Spanish and used that opportunity while standing near us to complain to another waitress on staff that she was just going to do as little as possible so she could go home sooner rather than later.  While I do understand that people are tired, it's still a job that you are expected to perform.  Because of this attitude she had, we experienced poor service all around.

However.  When you're coming off a near-brawl on a redeye from Honolulu, an overload of coffee, the coldest conference room conditions known to man and a projectile-vomiting-traveling companion you just want something comforting and predictable. The thing about Cheesecake and Grand Lux is that it's consistently good. Is it going to be great? No. But it's almost certainly not going to be bad. My breakfast was good. My pizza was good. My fruity smoothie fizz drink thing was good. The service was good.  Good enough is good enough.",

But it's right by the room elevators at the Palazzo and perfect for when you just want to order some food and bring it back to your room so your hungover friends can become alive again.  Without going into too much details -- it's Cheesecake Factory but named \"Grand Lux Cafe\".  Looking at the grand scheme of things, it's not really worth it.  Unless you get the corned beef hash.  Corned beef hash is the only thing worth giving it more than 3 stars.  Everything else is average at best.  But I DREAM about their corned beef hash.  I order that at other places and pray that it'll be just as good but usually it isn't.  It makes me sad.  Yes.  That really is all I have to say about that.",

While marching through on the way to an expo nearby, I'd stopped in here for an impromptu lunch. The waiter was quick and helpful and my chicken fettucini alfredo appeared soon after ordering. Almost too quick....  But it was tasty and the portions were large. Enough that I didn't need to eat dinner that night. And the price for this gargantuan portion was in the range of $13.   The menu appears expansive and the place is open until 2/3 am (and opens in the morning at 6). If I was staying at the Venetian, I'd see no need to eat anywhere else.",

Just like at its sister company Cheesecake Factory, I stick to burgers, sandwiches, and salads.  Who wants to order a pizza or an Asian dish from a restaurant that doesn't specialize in those things?  Normally I'd give this place 3 or 3.5 stars, but the Vegas locations get 2 stars due to one thing- the portion sizes.  I have a big appetite, and I can't even finish a sandwich there.  That is okay when you're at home and can take the food back home.  But nobody in Vegas is taking these leftovers back to their hotel room, so a ton of food (and your money) is wasted.",

Alot of places weren't even open yet, many others had a limited lunch menu. It was Sunday with football games on so, alot of the bar type places were packed. It really reminded me of Cheesecake Factory. Lots of menu choices. Staff was nice. I got Fried Chicken with Mashed Potatoes, it wasn't greasy, but it was a bit salty, I've had better, I've had worse. The potatoes were a bit bland, but my salty chicken helped even things out. I ordered a Pear Martini and they were out of the ingredients, so I had a delicious Strawberry Martini. My husband got a Cheeseburger and fries, the fries were good, I didn't try the burger but it looked good, he devoured it, and said it was better than he expected. I would eat here again if in a pinch, but with so many better restaurants in walking distance, it's doubtful.",

The buffet includes an omelet station , and the usual scrambled eggs, potatoes, sausage, bacon and an assortment of breads, pastries and fruit.  Excellent value for money.

It had the taste of plastic - not that it was chewy I really mean the flavor of it was plastic rather than bread. Really weird.

We showed up on time (actually 5 minutes early) but when they seated it us, it was at two large back to back booths. Meaning we were separated and couldn't even converse with half the group. When I asked to be moved to a different contiguous long table, they said they didn't have one for us. There was a long booth and chairs to the right of us that could have easily sat 14 but they had seated a party of two right in the middle of the row of tables! I asked them why couldn't we have gotten that long space (and why didn't they save it for us since they knew I was coming and had a res). They said making a reservation doesn't guarantee you all sit together. But that really doesn't make any sense! Why would I make a reservation one month in advance for 14 people if I didn't want to secure a table that could accommodate the whole group?! And if that was the restaurant policy, then they should have informed me of that when I booked because that might have changed my decision to have my birthday brunch there. I didn't find the management not staff to be very friendly or helpful. Food was decent but not worth the less than ideal seating arrangement despite my advance planning.",

You add bean sprouts and spinach and ask for sriracha and you just made yourself a healthy pho! The broth is sour so don't expect a beef flavored. And you don't really need sriracha but I love it spicy. It's a really good spin on pho. My GFs and I always get this late at night! Since grand Lux is open 24 hours, we eat here after clubbing.

Alex recommended his favorite dishes and we took a chance due to his confidence in suggestions. We got the buffalo egg rolls(mouth watering), steak and eggs (perfectly cooked) and the teriyaki beef and rice dinner (very flavorful). We had not waited long and Alex offered fries and bread while we waited for our meals and that was something we really appreciated. All around wonderful experience and thank you Alex! I wish I could write more about our superb experience! Definitely a place we'd go back to!!",

My family and I were wandering around looking for a place to eat when we came upon the Grand Lux.  They are a sister restaurant to the Cheesecake Factory so you know the menu is extensive.   After the old folks poured over the menu we all decided on something. We ordered a variety of items including soups, salads and sandwiches. I ordered their quesadilla which was excellent and a cucumber lemonade which was over the top delicious.  Everyone enjoyed their food and we ordered beignets for dessert...which in my opinion is reason enough to come here. They were absolutely delicious and came with three dipping sauces.    The service was good and I would definitely come back again.",

We ate at the Palazzo location thinking that the food would be amazing..but we were completely wrong. After looking at the pictures that were posted by Yelpers, I figured I couldnt go wrong with ordering their Salmom 3 ways, while my other friends ordered the beef wellington, jambalaya, steak sandwich with fries, and the asian lettuce wraps as an appetizer.   First dish that came out was the lettuce wraps. Maybe I had such high expectations because the Cheesecake Factory lettuce wraps are pretty darn good. BUT GODDAMN.. they served the chicken lettuce wraps in a luke warm dish that seemed microwaved and for dipping sauces was hoison sauce and MUSTARD. I never felt so offended in my life over an asian dish, but holy crap. Mustard for my lettuce wraps? Thats like eating spring rolls and dipping it into mustard sauce. I was so shocked and disgusted that I couldnt even touch it anymore. So forewarning, DO NOT GET THE LETTUCE WRAPS.   The salmon 3 ways was lukewarm as well and my friends jambalaya wasnt even hot. The steak sandwich was mediocre and the fries were literally the only thing they did right. My friend liked her beef wellington, which comes in 4 small pieces of cubed steak inside little small puff pastries. I guess that was cute, but that doesnt forgive on how bad 4/5 dishes were horrible.   Maybe we ordered the wrong thing? I honestly dont know..   PORTIONS ARE BIG THO.. but Im more of a quality of quantity kind of girl.   + One star for the waitress being semi-attentive and friendly.",

I stopped by Grand Lux with my girlfriend today on our way to Arizona for breakfast. Having been here before, it was a reliable choice for good breakfast food. I ordered the bacon and mushroom eggs Benedict as I wanted to try something different other than the typical English Benedict. The poached eggs were laid over thick-cut, crisp bacon, which were served over slices of toast I believe, as opposed to English muffin. Served on the side was a big slab of crispy hash-brown.   The hollandaise was just as good as I remembered: rich, creamy, and also earthy from the mushrooms. Overall, I liked the dish. It definitely got me full which was a plus since I was afraid two poached eggs over bacon wouldn't fill me up with my appetite. Although, there were negatives. The thick crispy bacon made it very clumsy to cut with fork and knife. I ended up destroying both of the benedict's structure. The eggs were not as runny as I hoped they would be and were slightly overcooked. The service we received was nothing special; he didn't bother checking up on us and we had to wait quite a while before our orders were taken.",

Food is similar to Cheesecake Factory so what you'd expect: big portions, decent food but nothing truly amazing or groundbreaking. A good standby when you are hungover or need something late.  We dropped by here before a show for a quick bite in the bar. The bartender never offered our group bread, he also rang in an order wrong for one gal in our group. He never once apologized and instead said I rang in the wrong thing so your food should be out soon. It took 20 minutes after all of everyone else's food arrived to be remade. As a server, I believe she should have been comped her meal. Especially since she had to box up the entire thing since we were all finished eating.  My second visit here was for take-out. I came in 15 minutes after I ordered and paid. I went to the side and waited 30 minutes longer, so I went over to the counter to make sure my food wasn't ready. The guy working the register just looked at me and looked away. So I waited another 15 minutes, and I went back and asked him. Turns out my food had been sitting there, ready, for who knows how long. He completely forgot I was even there waiting and I had already paid. When I got back to my room, the food was cold. Ugh.  In my opinion these two negative experiences could have been avoided with just simply better training and support from management.  I do highly recommend the chicken piccata, my favorite pasta here.",

My top two desserts are Beignets (only in this location) and Bread Pudding. Those desserts might take a while to be made, but mann those are the best. The beignets are warm, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, perfection. The sauces that come with the beignets are also to die for, especially the vanilla and chocolate ones. The bread pudding is amazing, beyond this world.   Never ever go to Vegas without tasting the yummy desserts from Grand Lux.",

From Italian, Chinese, American, etc. it's literally a 15 page menu. The after midnight menu just goes on.",

Shannon and Deborah were our servers and they were GREAT. Shannon was so sassy (in a good and fun way!) and Deborah was very sweet!  If you haven't had the beignets.... they will change your LIFE. They're warm French doughnuts dusted with powdered sugar and served with various types of sauces such as raspberry, vanilla, and a maple/butter house sauce. AMAZING. Just a heads up-- the beignets are made to order fresh so order them ASAP with your morning coffee.  We also ordered the delux breakfast sandwich to split with hash browns. It was tasty! The eggs were fluffy. The tomatoes on there were fresh as can be and the havarti cheese was an exquisite taste that made this unique compared to other breakfast sandwiches. This sandwich was a 4/5 just because their hash browns on the side that came with it were not seasoned very well. They were crispy though!  We also split the Short Rib Benedict. O-M-G. My boyfriend got me out of my comfort zone here... it is short ribs with a poached egg, hollandaise sauce and sauteed mushrooms on top of a crispy potato cake. Those flavors were so harmonious and amazing!! We got this dish 2 days in a row because of how great it was!  Regardless to say, you've got to try this place. And the good news is they're open almost all the time...",

The menu here is really large; dishes are served based on time of day but the food is very fluid in terms of when they are able to be served. Along with a large menu, the food options are very versatile and can fulfill any craving!  I ordered the spinach & cheese dip and it was phenomenal!!! The flavor it exudes is very top tier. By far one of my favorite cheese dips. I also got a side of sauteed mushrooms and they were amazing.  The wait time for food was only about 30 minutes; I was here around 12 AM and it was still pretty packed. The ambience, menu, and food resembles that of Cheesecake Factory for reference!",

    "text": "What a fantastic dining experience! Looking for a \"medium-nice\" place for dinner with the family during our stay at the Palazzo. I wasn't expecting much for what is essentially the house restaurant, and was completely caught off guard - this place is sneaky. The review is for the Palazzo restaurant, not the Grand Lux in the Venetian.  The atmosphere is reminiscent of a grand train station in Vienna; it is physically a very large space, while being cozy, and you could make it whatever you wanted - come in casual clothes with kids, or dress-up, it's suitable and comfortable for either. The menu is extensive; American, Italian, Asian - you name it, they got it. Started with some fun tropical cocktails that were huge when they arrived at the table, then a couple of glasses of nice red. I had a beef wellington dish that was out of this world; the sauce had the richest, beefiest flavor I ever tasted, with some crispy roasted vegetables that had me in tears they were so good. My wife and one son had the ribeye ravioli with a nice cream sauce that was also Devine. Other sons had a burger and a steak, cooked to perfection. Finished with a couple of (large) desserts - a good cheesecake, key lime pie and coffee.  Throughout, the service was prompt and professional, and the bill was a real surprise considering it was a bit over $200 for the 5 of us - it felt like a real value compared to so many other places we have been to, and being half as satisfied. Highly recommended if you are looking for good food, experience and value, in a humble, non-celebrity chef establishment while in Vegas.",

Heard the buffet was good from my cousin's husband. $24.99 in Vegas is not bad and he raved about the biscuits and gravy and juice was included, which is nice when considering prices overall. I think the buffet is only available on weekends.   4 stars for food and price. 3 stars overall due to service and ambiance. Ambiance is nice but not special enough for 4 stars. Bathroom is outside of the restaurant which is kind of annoying too when you just want to wash your hands before your meal. Not a bad thing place at all if you are staying at the Venetian. We liked it so much we ate there twice and also due to convenience. Smoke in the casino getting there was not good though for the kiddos.",

A group of us came here and we squeezed eight people into a long booth. Honestly we thought it would be six people but two more arrived and we just made due. Honestly, their booths are quite large because we did have elbow room!   With the added two people, our servers were very accommodating and friendly. They made sure everyone ordered and received our food promptly, all with a smile!   I ordered the clam chowder, the fish and chips and the Asian Pear Martini. I thought everything that I ordered was very tasty especially the fish and chips. We also shared a bottle of pinot noir and the server made sure that the first six at the table, had enough wine in our glasses. Very nice wine pour!   I do like Grand Lux, not only for the food but for the prices. Restaurants on the strip can be pricey but Grand Lux has excellent On The Strip prices for good quality food. Pretty delish!",

Had the option to upgrade to their breakfast buffet for $8.50 per person and did.  There were 8 persons in our group and everyone enjoyed the buffet.  The orange juice was freshly squeezed, oat meal freshly made, and the eggs, ham, waffles, bacon, sausage, fruit, hash browns.........everything was delicious.  For $8.50 per person, it was a bargain.  I understand that the regular charge for the buffet is $16.  So if you are staying at the Venetian/Palazzo for your stay in Las Vegas, be sure to ask them to include the complimentary breakfast buffet.",

BAD F-EN mistake. everything we order was awful or nasty. Zen Noodles, YUCK!!!!! NO! bland bland bland. better off with chicken noodle soup but THEY DON'T make that. Chicken and Waffles, my friend said it was 'horrific' and 'nasty' i didn't try it but looking at her expressions tells me im better off NOT trying it. seared ahi... wow, is this seriously \"AHI\"?!?!? I had the Pasta with Chicken Tomatoes and Garlic over creamy sauce, the pasta itself was overcooked!!! :( My friend had the Caramel chicken and Sauteed Beef. we aske dher, hey what did you ordered? She said \"awful\" practically renamed her plate. I ordered the Creamy Chicken Soup. CREAMY is a understatement, i took 2 spoonful and gave up! GROSS, creamy... well it was WAY THE HELL beyond creamy because when he cooled it looked like BUTTER! i think they only good plate that no one complained about was Shrimp Scampi. So if you're as unfortunately as us and was forced to eat there because Palazzo and Venetian didn't have any food places opened after 3AM, then order yourself a Shrimp Scampi.. because everything else on the menu is \"HORRIBLE, AWFUL and NASTY\"   Service was great, well, how can it possibly be NOT GREAT being that it is in the the Palazzo?? but food wise, walk to DENNY'S!! You'll be better off eatting there.",

Knowing that it was owned by the same company as the Cheesecake Factory, I had high expectations. I ended up ordering a full size pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom pizza for about $13. Wow... the size of the pizza was so overwhelming! I split half of it with my friend and I was still very full. The meats were tasty, the pizza dough perfect, and the sauce was fresh. This was the perfect hangover food to have in Vegas. I also tip off my hat to our waitress, who was dealing with a still drunk buddy of mine and had to fight off my friend's marriage proposals. She was a champ and played with him, which made for an entertaining meal for the table. I'm glad I got to try this place, I will for sure stop by next time I am in Vegas, maybe when I am stumbling along the casino floor and stop by this 24-hour joint for some terrific food.",

We went to try it out and this was a great choice for food. It was conveniently in our hotel with GREAT food. I liked their salads but also their flat bread chicken sandwiches. They are pretty expensive for a sandwich but the sandwich was huge! It made up for the price because of its amazing taste. I also loved their juicy angus burgers. They tasted like they were made with high quality beef and I wish their was one of these restaurants in Sacramento. Next time I head to las vegas, I know where im heading when i get hungry. Overall Convenient, Tasty, & HUGE. They also had a good staff and the wait was about 10-15 minutes. But its better than going to the restaurant side of it. I just went in the togo side and went and ate the delicious food in my room",

    "text": "Me and my husband recently got married in Las Vegas and were looking for a good, affordable place to have a reception. We had about 40 guests in a private dining room and customized a private dining menu from the regular dining menu. We must say we were extremely happy with the food, as were as our guests ( and we have some picky eaters!) We had a four course menu and everything was hot, fresh, and great tasting! We loved the double stuffed potato spring rolls & fried calamari & rock shrimp. The wedge salad was great and so flavorful. Many of our guests ordered the filet mignon and all were very satisfied. Since Grand Lux is affiliated with the Cheesecake Factory, we choose their fresh strawberry cheesecake for dessert, giant piece, not too sweet, and very tasty. We were extremely happy with our food and our experience at the Grand Lux Palazzo. Portions were huge and affordable for the size. You will leave beyond full, with food to take home!",

The burger was very bland. The meat was not to my liking at all. I figured it would have value from how thick the meat was, but it just tasted like charcoal. The pastas are pricey. The 18inch margarita pizza was more of a flat bread that's could feed two, but as an appetizer. Definitely wouldn't be back.",

Located in the Palazzo and very close to LAVO, this is a good place for pre-clubbing large groups and those late night drinkers who desperately need to eat.   Every time I've come here the service has been hit or miss. This place tends to be busy no matter what time of day it is. It took our waiter about 45 minutes just to get us waters. It took just as long to get us extra silverware and napkins. Our waiters were switched out twice, which is something that somewhat bothers me when it comes to service because our last waiter had everyone's orders mixed up and even brought the wrong drinks at one point.   The food was decent, but nothing really to rave about. Neither were the drinks, although fancy sounding lowered my expectations. The portions were plentiful and matched their fair prices. Presentation was done well, but completely overshadowed by the service.   Honestly, this place is never my first choice when it comes to restaurants in Vegas, but mostly a last resort. I've had better service at a Cheesecake Factory.",

I don't think too many people have realized them or how awesome they are, based on the small crowd that was there while we were there.  First of all, it's a nice little place. It is a classy looking joint (although they definitely feature a large TV for sports). I found this place on the internet before embarking on our Vegas vacation and knew I wanted to eat there. We enjoyed it so much the first time, we went back for more! It is a best kept secret...  They have the most amazing Happy Hour I have ever seen. They have a ton of $5-$7 appetizers and drinks. The first time we purchased a total of 5 appetizers & 4 high end drinks for about $50.  My husband loved their fried buffalo things (I guess I should look up the actual name). He ordered them more than once. We ordered their macaroni skillet twice. We tried several different things and all were delicious. I definitely recommend only ordering the spinach dip if more than one person wants it! I was the only who wanted it and it was far too much for one but delicious. As far as drinks go, I am a super fan of their raspberry cosmopolitan. I often check menus for those now based on this experience.   Their staff is also beyond polite. Super nice guys & very accommodating! I will return to this place during every stay I have in Vegas.",

This photo may not look like much, but these are pure bacon pieces of heaven in your mouth. There is nothing like Niman Ranch Bacon EVER!.... this is not on the menu, but should be, I would pay $10-15 just for these Niman Ranch Bacon pieces....YUM!     I have had Cafe Du Monde and I love them. But, New Orleans is a little to far just to get some beignets. The beignets at the Grand Lux are very, very, very delicious. They give Cafe Du Monde some competition.  For the potato lover, I would definitely suggest the Stuffed Potato Egg Roll It is stuffed with gooey cheesy mash potatoes and off course bacon, sour cream and more cheese on top. Skip the buffets....come here, open until 3am on weekends!",

It's commercial and not great and the menu is full of too many options that are usually just ok, as it often is when you generalize instead of specialize.  That being said, we needed food and we needed it ASAP. We ordered the steak and eggs breakfast with wheat toast and crispy hash browns, the avocado chipotle burger, a side of fruit, 2 coffees, and 2 spicy bloody Mary's. Turned out that our order was a serious case of the good, the bad, and the ugly.  The good: the steak was decent, not too much fat, and decently medium rare. The bloody Mary's are delicious- the pickled asparagus was a great surprise for flavor. French fries were decent. Eggs were perfectly scrambled.  The bad: we ordered our burger medium well. It came medium rare. I don't mind, but my boyfriend hates how it makes the bun soggy.   The ugly: it took an insane amount of time to get our food and our drinks. The hash browns had to be sent back because they were soggy. The most amazing was how hard it was to get wheat toast. We had to send our toast back THREE times, no joke. We got sourdough twice and then white. What the hell?  For the price, this was a massive pain in the ass. Never again.  **update: both boyfriend and I got sick three hours later. Definitely from the food. Never going back, for sure.",

Ive been hearing for years about Grand Lux Cafe here in L.A.,after years & years at the Beverly Center it just closed i thought i had missed out, i didnt know it was a chain restaurant. We went here with just a bit over an hour to eat, we were going to a show. So we didnt have alot of time to totally enjoy the place but our time there was good. It was about 6:30pm so the dinner crowd was there not packed but getting there, we got a table right away.The decor was beautiful. The hostess & our waitress were both professional & attentive. Since we were pressed for time we ordered 3 medium plates from the menu. We nibbled on the bread basket while we waited for our meal which didnt take long at all. All 3 meals were perfectly cooked & just the right size portion. We had a great meal and made it to our 8:00 show on time. Next visit we will make sure and have plenty of time the dessert menu looked scrumptious.",

    "text": "Ate at this restaurant three times while in Vegas this last weekend (twice for breakfast and once for dinner). Very reasonably priced and high quality food. Very large portions with a very big menu with just about everything. Restaurant is owned my the same company who owns The Cheesecake Factory so it has a very similar feel and atmosphere. We had the chicken and waffles for breakfast, the Deluxe sandwhich, crab and asparagus omelette and beignets for breakfast across the two times we visited. For dinner, we started with the small portion of the calamari. It was good but nothing different than your standard fried calamari. For our entree, we shared the Cobb salad and the bbq chicken pizza. Thank goodness we shared as the portions are huge and we couldn't even finish what we ordered. All the food was very good and service was also good. Only reason for four stars was due to the wait time for the food. Each time we waited for our food it seemed much longer than expected. Would still highly recommend.",

No matter how I felt, Grand Lux has always been there for me 24 hours a day and I'm truly grateful for their comfort food that soothes my soul.  Okay I may be a little dramatic, but since this Grand Lux is in Vegas, there are crazy drunk and hungry people coming in around the clock. The menu is extensive so you can pretty much satisfy nearly any appetite. Typically if I order off the pasta section, another girl and I could share it pretty easily. There isn't really much of a difference between Grand Lux and The Cheesecake Factory except maybe a slight menu change. All the food is still very similar and much like The Cheesecake Factory, everything you order will be pretty good. If it isn't, I don't think they'd have any problem changing it for you since their customer service is always very good.  I typically frequent The Grand Lux in The Palazzo, but keep in mind there's also one in The Venetian. Confusing, I know. But if you're meeting people just make sure you specify.",

Of course there are other mouth watering options on the menu that I haven't tried yet but that burger...MaMamia!! You rediscover the burger at each bite, first you taste the bun -a tasty brioche (and trust me, I know what a good broche tastes like I'm french)- then comes the juicy patty and finally you discover the mushrooms, there they are, so yummilicious. It's a very pleasant experience. And you can't stop until you've had the very last bite which is the best. Try it, it's a must. You'll thank me later.",

Wasnt served an actual pie crust, but instead just the pasty puff at the top of the dish. Different twist, but too damn good. Brussel sprouts as a side. They were cooked just the way I like them, softer.   Service was great. Will always return.",

Great sauce, nice veggies.  My wife had the waffles.  Really great syrup, she wants to bottle it and bring it home.    We also had breakfast here the next day.  Small, but nice buffet selection.  Also can order a la carte.  I had the eggs Benedict which was good, but not great.  But certainly we will be back for any meals here whenever we're back in Vegas.",

We had the breakfast included in our stay via the AMEX offer and were able to enjoy every morning.

The brunch is very reasonably priced. I think I had the breakfast sandwich and it was only around $10  For dinner my three friends and I ordered from the \"Big Small Plates\" menu and boy were we stuffed (plus we all had leftovers)! All three of our dishes were recommended by our friendly server. I ordered the Salmon with the pea puree and veggies (delicious). One of my friends ordered the steak with fried brussel sprouts and let me tell you, THIS STOLE THE NIGHT! OMG this hits my top 5 in fried foods. Basically they peeled the leaves of the brussel sprouts and fried them, simple as that, but it was surprising very delicious! I would highly recommend ordering these! My other friend ordered the dish with gnocchi and loved it as well.   Our server was an older lady and was so nice! She was like a mom to us when she came over and was worried as to why we didn't finish our meals (but it was because we were stuffed, not that we didn't like the food!)  Drinks: I ordered the pineapple cocktail recommended by our waitress and it was sooo delicious! Would definitely recommend it!",

We got the asian flavored one. Perfectly crispy and flavorful. I ordered the half soup, half salad. The soup was not good. Too much cream & sugar (makes it sound like I'm drinking coffee doesn't it haha) but it was not tasty at all.   Large portion sizes but the price range is also higher, once again like cheesecake factory.   Oh and quick tip for the gals, I don't know why their floors are so slippery!

Simple, but the sauce was creamy and delicious as though they made it from scratch. Also got a Warm Goat Cheese Salad. The 'fried' goat cheese balls were delish but did not enjoy the dressing as much....it had apple chunks drizzled with honey which made the salad just a but too sweet. Not bad though.

    "text": "We had to come back to this wonderful Cafe situated in the Palazzo. There is another location bordering to the Venetian.  We ordered the following items off the menu (during lunch time):  - Kobe Meatballs Kobe Beef Meatballs Covered in Marinara Sauce. Served on a Bed of Creamy Cheese Polenta. Two super big Kobe Meatballs that were juicy and flavorful, yet light enough. It is a meat-heavy meal, so you should order a salad to balance it out. It is an excellent plate to share.  - Chicken Parmesan A Chicken Breast Coated with Parmesan Bread Crumbs and Covered with Tomato Sauce and Mozzarella Cheese. Served with Pasta. This was a huge plate of spaghetti and Parmesan breaded tender chicken. Very delish.  - Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich Grilled Chicken Breast Topped with Avocado, Pepper-Jack Cheese, Corn, Lettuce, Tomato and Black Bean-Mayo on Our Grilled Flatbread. Ordered with a side salad which came with the Roasted Tomato-Caramelized Onion Vinaigrette.  Every single item was beautifully prepared and served. The price and food ratio is perfect, since it can be shared, but also consumed if you're really hungry.  Since this was our second visit at the Grand Lux Cafe, our server tipped us on a secret gem on the menu which is the Mediterranean Mahi Mahi. We will definitely be back here and try out more items from their huge menu.  NOTE: The restaurant/cafe is owned by Cheesecake Factory, thus not allowing the usage/redemption of the Grazie Player's Card points at this location.",

I don't have anything to say about the food it was okay. But the customer service is horrible. You have to ask multiple times to get a water refill and send your food back three time just for them to get the order right and even the third time the order was wrong but how many time can you send it back.... On top of that your waiter just decides to disappear and not come back to your table so then you have to track down another waiter to just get your check. Considering this restaurant is in a five star hotel the service was very unprofessional.",

    "text": "The sister company of Cheesecake Factory. I pretty much live for Cheesecake Factory. Unfortunately, Grand Lux just wasn't on par. They were just average in my opinion. I dined here twice on my recent trip to Vegas, as I stayed at the Palazzo. It is a quick and convenient restaurant to have inside a hotel.   My first visit was for take out. I ended up getting a lunch portion of their half BLT with a soup and salad. It was A LOT of food. Portions here are HUGE. The chicken tortilla soup was very tasty and very filling. I could tell there was a lot of sodium though, which is expected. There was so much bacon in the BLT and I am not one to waste bacon, but I just couldn't eat it all. Salad was ok. The balsamic dressing was odd but tasty I guess. Even though I tried to get something \"healthy\", I still felt very bloated after. Obviously all the sodium.  For dinner on my last night, I got the chicken parm. WOW. This chicken parm was bigger than my face. The waiter did try to warn me on the portion but I didn't think it was going to be THAT big. I ended up eating only a quarter of it and took the rest home on the plane. It actually wasn't even that good, but I didn't want to waste it. It was also too salty. Not enjoyable. Our waiter that night was very friendly. I wish I remembered his name. His customer service was excellent and the way he treated all customers was very respectable.  I probably won't stay at the Palazzo again, which means I probably won't go out of my way to eat here again either. I'll stick to the Cheesecake Factory.",

Right next to the elevator bay was Grand Lux Cafe, and I ordered a chicken sandwich and fries before the kitchen closed.   My order took what felt like my entire life. I told my friend that they must have raised and slaughtered the chicken before preparing it for my meal, because that was the only reasonable explanation for the delay.   When it was ready, I grabbed the bag and ran upstairs. I ate it in bed and fell asleep directly. I woke up to a bunch of cold, uneaten fries, so they were apparently not that good.",

It even has little blueberries in it. The Pastrami Reuben Eggrolls were also delicious. They had just the right amount of pastrami inside the restaurant is nice and clean. Happy hour is only in the bar area. It started to get busy right before happy hour was ending so make sure you get there a little earlier.

I ordered the pasta with chicken, mushrooms, and sundried tomatoes. It was decent, but not one of the best pasta dish I've had. It was made a bit too salty, a remark shared by my friend who felt her pasta dish was too salty as well. Nevertheless, it was still a filling meal and  the portions I took to-go became a yummy midnight snack.   Our waitress was very friendly and energetic.

Grand Lux is a safe pick for a meal because the menu is extensive and the food is pretty good. Service is usually good as well.   This was my first visit to the Grand Lux Cafe inside the Palazzo. Our waitress was the best. She asked us if we were from out of town. We responded that we weren't and were mainly here for the beignets.  She gave us a tip that it would take about 20 minutes to make and that she'll alert the kitchen when we were about halfway through our meals.  I had their turkey burger and a dry baked potato. Overall, my meal was just okay. Now, back to the beignets. You get 8 large sized beignets in a basket. The beignets are served fresh, hot, and lightly coated with powdered sugar.  I'm not even going to try to describe how good these beignets are.  But I tell you what...they're pretty close to Cafe du Monde minus the powdery mess.  Yes, they're that good here and well worth the trip to the strip. I just rhymed for next time.   Tip #1:  The beignets are served only at the Grand Lux Cafe in the Palazzo. Tip #2:  Ranked 2nd for \"Best Beignets\" in Las Vegas. NOTE: Bouchon is ranked #1.   2016 Yelp Review #20",

It's located in the back of Palazzo. It is a good brunch spot and they have the best Belgian Waffles with a super delicious butter scotch(?) maple syrup. The waffle is very light, fluffy, and crispy while the syrup is a light butter scotch caramel-y flavor that isn't overpowering and sweet. Get the Fried Chicken & Waffles combo and you get the best of both worlds!  I didn't order their steak but did get to try some of it and it was also very good. Well cooked, tender and juicy.   Apparently it's a Cheesecake Factory restaurant but it is much much better IMO.",

Be weary late night goers, this place will get crowed after 2AM, filled with drunken and fun people alike. You can see the guy who passed out before his meal even got there, the black footed club chicks who walk around barefoot after a long night in sexy heels, and your typical just hungry drunks!

I may be a little biased, however, as this place quite possibly saved my life after a night of adventures.  At 9am, we were seated right away and quickly became overwhelmed by the extensive menu.  Luckily it is printed in a way that the most-hungover (me) person could easily find a remedy through the bold-faced caption: \"Morning Cocktails.\"   My friend and I recapped our evening of foibles, fliratations, confrontations with priests, and make-out sessions etc. while noshing on warm and tasty beignets, a strawberry bellini and orders of egg breakfast and chilaquiles.  Everything was delicious!  The portions were large enough that had we not eaten with our eyes instead of our stomachs, we could have easily shared plates.  Lest you think I found this place delicious due to sleep deprivation or a hangover, I came back for snack/dinner in a much more sober state.  The short rib grilled cheese sandwich was delightful enough that I saved half of it for the plane ride home.   As others have noted, this place gives you access to a convenient affordable restaurant where you can literally come as you are and have a wide variety to choose from.  Plus, you gotta love a place that has a subheading of \"Morning Cocktails\" on its menu!",

One look at the menu and decor... hey, this reminds me of Cheesecake (oh the irony)!  We got a Santa Barbara Chicken Sandwich and Short Rib Grilled Cheese.  I subbed my fries for sweet potatoes, but they brought out mashed potatoes (which were SO GOOD, so I didn't care); waiter caught the booboo and brought out an extra plate of mashed yams (double the carbs + starchy goodness for me!).  It was a solid slightly greasy lunch that hit the spot.  I would prefer this place over room service - its cheaper and I like the portion size, especially when you're hungry.  We wanted to order to-go for the road on the day of checkout, but NO ONE PICKED UP THE PHONE.  I do love the idea that they're open for late-night service a la Denny's, their food sounds like it would be good after a night of debauchery.",

Thinh L's burger (the Max?) was overcooked and they didnt even bring it out because they knew it was overcooked so they brought him a new one with a box of cookies. warm fresh cookies.  Update once i remember what i ate. Hey its vegas. We're always drunk.",

Asian chicken salad was the best I've ever had! The watercress, fried won tons, cilantro and nutty dressing combined to make an awesome tasty salad. I must replicate this one at home.   Corned beef and hash was great also. It was made with homemade corned beef, not the one in the can. (Sorry, you Filipinos). I can't find homemade corned beef and hash anywhere in the bay so having this lux at Grand Lux was wonderful.  Mixed berries were extremely fresh and plentiful. Beautiful presentation as well.   The servings were surprisingly huge! I expected a big price for a small plate, but everything that came out was stacked heap high! We were oooohing and aaahhhhing everything that came out the kitchen. I wanted to order it all! Too bad we lost almost all our spending money on the stupid slot machines.",

I have to admit that my memories of this place are a little faded due to the large quantities of alcohol consumed over the 24 hour period but I do remember especially liking the buffalo wing egg roll appetizers and my entree which was the Mongolian Steak dish which was served with white rice and very fresh flat bread. I had it served medium rare and it was delicious.   The only reason for the 4 instead of the five star was that one of the chicken pasta dishes we ordered arrived a bit cool and not up to the standards of the rest of the dishes.   It was an overall good meal and look forward to eating here again.",

    "text": "A fan of Grand Lux and Cheesecake Factory so I went for lunch yesterday before heading to the Azure Pool at the Palazzo. There were 5 of us and it took a few minutes to get seated as usual. Food- very good and generally fair priced for a casino restaurant. I ordered one of my favs - the Short Rib Grilled Cheese Sandwich and substituted white rice for fries. Short rib was cooked perfectly and the sandwich is just amazing. I wish it was a tad bit bigger but its ok. The rice came out nice and hot and was a great compliment to my sandwich instead of fries. ***side note: i'm so over french fries... every once in a while I'll give in but they just do nothing for me anymore***   My girlfriend ordered the Caramel Chicken dish to split with a friend. They loved it and I tried some and it was really good.  Our server, while very friendly, kept disappearing for a while. The only problem I have with Cheesecake Factory and Grand Lux is that they are so big that when its busy the servers are insanely hard to get a hold of. Bread took a while to come out and then wasn't hot when it came out. He apologized saying he had to wait for it but if he had to wait for it shouldn't it be hot? just curious  Overall a great meal and I will for sure go back. The food is good and reliable. Yet to have a bad experience at either.",

    "text": "Nothing like having yummy food right at the elevator entrance to make you almost OK with dining in your pajams on the late-night. I said ALMOST.... ::hangs head in shame:: Ate there twice this past visit and both times, service was pretty stellar. Both times, the waitress was attentive and quick to bring us what we needed. My girls and I shared orders from the \"Small Bites\" section during our first visit, which were exactly what we needed to fuel our subsequent visit to Azure afterward (because who really wants to see my extended post-nosh belly? Not me!). We ordered a couple plates of the mini-tacos (both pork and fish), the mac and cheese and the ahi ceviche. For having such an extensive menu, all items were tasty and left very good impressions with all of us. Between three rather ravenous girls, we were satiated without being uncomfortably full.  The second visit was a post-drinking munchy-fix, so burgers were on our mind. I originally ordered the veggie burger and the waitress was quick to check to see if I had ordered it before, as she did NOT recommend it (love honesty from waitstaff!). I went with her recommendation of the mushroom burger, which was satisfiying, if a little mushy (might not be extremely possible to construct a firmer mushroom patty than what it was). Our water glasses were never empty and we were never neglected, despite the late hour and the hordes of Vegas revelers that were all looking for their drunken nosh. The Palazzo is a definite repeat for me, and hence, so is GLC, ESPECIALLY during those late-night seshs.",

    "text": "Came on a recommendation of a friend. This location is newer and nicer and looks bigger than its counterpart at the Venetian. Also they have desserts - like the beignets - which take half an hour to make (or so they say) so you should order them at the beginning of your meal with your entree. Anyways in addition to the beignets, I ordered the chicken and waffles per other yelpers suggestions. Luckily they still served some of the breakfast items even though we went almost near dinnertime. So while we waited for food, they had some complementary warm bread. Mmm. Finally when the food came out, it all looked super delicious. For my dish, the waffle was really light, which helped in trying to finish the meal. It's not very cakey/bready like how it is at coffee shop breakfast places. So I liked it. The chicken was like mini chicken strips - white meat, breaded and no bones. Not exactly up to roscoe's standards but delicious all the same. I also got to try the short rib tacos, the Sunday night pasta and another pasta dish I don't remember. The Sunday night pasta is the bomb and it should be for $18. The portion is huge - enough for two people at least. And they say they make the pasta fresh every day and it's topped with this sauce that will satisfy any meat lover. It was even great, cold, later that night after a few drinks and I don't usually like cold foods. The other pasta dish was just ok and the short rib had this sweet flavor that was a bit odd. My chicken and waffles was like $14 so prices are about what you would pay at cheesecake factory. Service was eh - waitress would disappear or long periods of time.",

    "text": "I came here w/ my guy after going to the Blue Man Group last week. I've eaten at Grand Luxe at the Venetian many times before but this was my first time here at the Palazzo location. The establishment is tucked away at the far corner of the Palazzo, right by the Jersey Boy Theater. The atmosphere when we came here was great. It's not as loud as the Venetian location. We were seated at a booth by the entrance and was greeted by a nice server. I ordered the Mushroom burger and the guy ordered a chicken meatball sandwich w/ fries and a side of ranch. We didn't wait too long for our food to come out and it was pretty ok, nothing to get too excited about. My mushroom burger was bland..but i expected that since no meat was involved and it was pretty much just a mushroom patty. They guy said his food was just ok...BUT the fries were stale and cold! on top of that, they forgot to bring out the ranch. We nicely asked the food runner to bring us the side of ranch which we ordered in the very beginning, and he unhappily said, \"Yea\". Like dude I know you hate your job but damn I'm not your homie so don't talk to me like I'm your homie and you can at least smile a little. The worst part about it is that we didn't get the ranch and we didn't see our server until we were done eating. Not even a refill, or \"how's your food?\" or anything. ...We didn't get squat. But just because that happened doesn't mean I should give this place one star.  After all, the food wasn't horrible. We didn't leave the place feeling butt hurt about the service..we just didn't tip as much =D..problem solved.   Overall, I would definitely come back here to give it another shot. If you've never had a mushroom burger, you should def try it..just add a little bit of salt. But also keep in mind that since it's a mushroom patty, it falls apart easily so it could get messy. The guy said his chicken meatball sandwich was 'ok' but not the best. They have a good atmosphere here and if you are an indecisive person when it comes to food, you might want to stop here. They have a big selection of food on their menu.",

The food: We ordered Spring rolls for starters; they were delish! My husband ordered the rib eye steak and he loved it.  I ordered the salmon cooked three ways; it was fabulous. We couldn't fit in dessert, but I have no doubt that would have been awesome too.  The best part was the service. Our waitress, Erica (I believe that was her name), was SO great! She knew so much about the food and answered all of our questions. She was friendly and gave us great service all the way.  Our bill came to a little over $80, and that was with a generous tip. I would totally go back to Grand Lux. I've spent much more money in Las Vegas on food; this place is a gem and you get everything you pay for. For the quality of food and service, $80 is cheap in my book.",

I would have given this restaurant 5 stars but the service wasn't that great this time. I would definitely go there again though and try their other dishes and also try a dessert.",

The service this time around was bad but I tell ya I really didn't care once I had that warm creamy delicious soup in my mouth... yes I still give it 5 stars..",

The decor was casual elegant, not that I'm complaining about it, I actually think it's a good thing. It makes the food taste extra good considering the nice, grand decor. My friend and I ordered the ultimate appetizers which served different types of cuisine from around the globe like spring rolls, Philadelphia steak rolls, chicken, and etc. (My memory is a bit lacking since it's been almost two weeks now) Though the food is okay, the dish was served in large portion. Now that's a great appetizers all for 30 bucks!",

Anyway- I'd give them 4 starts but the problem is that I had a party of 5 and ALL OF OUR ENTREES CAME OUT COLD AND HARD- not fresh at all!  My pasta was like a glued-together stage-prop!    They were very accommodating because they brought us all out fresh food- but that means we had to wait for new food! and we were starving as it was.  The manager apologized and gave us a free bag of cookies.. but we should've received a pretty decent discount based on the fact they screwed up 5/5 entrees- and you just cant run a business like that- not in vegas at least.

It looked to him like I ate quite a bit of the nachos. But I shared them with two others we all had one each. So to him it appeared as though we ate most of them.

Came here with the girls after Encore Beach Club to get a bite to eat before heading to Marquee. I heard it was a branch from The Cheesecake Factory so I wasn't expecting much from it. (Obviously not a big fan of The Cheesecake Factory. Service was great. Only downside is that it took quite awhile for the food to come out.

I've had the Avocado-Chipotle cheeseburger, Grand Club sandwich, Filet Mignon, and Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo... All of them we're delicious! I also like their breakfast buffet although I prefer Wynn's breakfast buffet. But the real reason why I love this place is because of two things: COOKIES AND BEIGNETS Holy mother of flavor explosion in your mouth! Get these desserts. I don't care if I'm on a diet, I WILL GET THESE desserts because they are worthy enough to break the rules.  Oh, and also Palazzo is only open til a certain time while Venetian's is open 24 hrs!

I came here soon after the Yelp Helps event came to an end. The decor is impressive and compliments the Palazzo Hotel theme quite nicely. There is a TV by the bar, an awesome display of wine collections, and decorations here and there to tease the eye. Don't let the name Cafe fool you! This is a clean, upscale venue.  We were seated and received fabulous service from our waiter. He recommended the pasta plate and we went with it, ordering just one plate. The portions are more than generous! For under $20, the pasta fed my partner and I more than enough. Aside from pasta, I know they also have a wide array of salads and burgers, which I will definitely try in the future.  The bartender really knows his stuff. I never knew Tokyo Tea or mixed drinks from the bar can taste so good. I'm beginning to understand why some of my friends hate the idea of ordering drinks at nightclubs. Nightclub \"bartenders\" just does not compare. Now I'm making it a routine for me to pick up a drink at a bar before hitting the clubs.  The total tab came out to be about $30 with tip. I will definitely be coming to this venue again in the future.",

I thought I would be good and order a salad - I got the ahi tuna salad.  The bf went the opposite direction - he got the chicken and waffles.  =)  We started off with the spinach dip...nothing glorious but it did taste good.  My salad...oh goodness, my salad.  It was ginormous.  It tasted fine...the dressing was actually really nice but it felt like I had three pounds of salad on a plate and it was just too much for me.  The ahi was actually the low point...I thought it would be cooked/seared on the outside but instead the outside was basically seaweed wrapped around.  I probably would not get this again.  The real champion of the night was the chicken and waffles.  At first, they told us the chicken was actually chicken tenders...the bf made a face at me like, \"what the heck - why called it fried chicken?\"  However, once we tasted it...it was heavenly!  The tenders are amazing...juicy & the breading/battered coating was really yummy.  The waffle was really good too and I was completely jealous our entire meal...kept stealing bites of chicken when I could.  It was a lot of food so the bf obliged.  =)  Overall, I would definitely eat here over and over again.  The food is good, service was friendly - lots of variety, prices are great and it's a good restaurant that's not super fancy but not fast food either.",

Here's the tricky part - BOTH properties have a Grand Lux Cafe, so if you are meeting friends, make damn sure you know WHICH one you're meeting at!  The food is a tad pricey here, but you are in Las Vegas, so expect that. It's not outrageously expensive; it's just definitely priced according to where it is and the property it is part of.  A GREAT tip: This location is by far, the least busy of the two. When there are huge lines at the Venetian location, this one is almost always a walk-in.   The portions here are beyond generous; I've had burgers here as well as salads - everything is very tasty and absolutely satisfying.  The last time we were here, service started great and then our waitress simply disappeared; to the point of being frustrating. Thus, the three stars instead of four.  If you need to take a break from gambling or are looking for a nice spot for dinner before hitting a night club, this is a solid choice; you won't be disappointed.",

They're also open 24 hours which is very convenient for late night munchies.  Overall the food was very good and reminiscent of the cheesecake factory (Company/Owners).  But I personally think the Grand Lux is much better than the Cheesecake factory.  We tried most of the pastas, some sandwiches and the asian specialties over rice.  Here are my favorites:  **Pasta Telephono- Creamy tomato sauce baked with melted mozzarella and breadcrumbs... delicious!  **Crispy Caramel Chicken- Sweet, crispy and tangy little pieces of fried chicken over rice... sorta like orange chicken but much much better.  *The Shaking Beef is also very good and has a similar flavor.  **Seared Ahi Tuna salad- very light and refreshing with a good amount of fish.  **Spinach dip- Creamy with lots of spinach and artichoke and not too heavy like other spinach dips  **Short-rib grilled cheese-  tender short rib with different melted cheeses and caramelized onions.  Very filling...  My least favorite meal was the ZEN NOODLES- overpriced with mediocre broth.  I thought it would be just like Pho Ga(chicken) but it was way too lemony and the rice noodles were thick and too hard.  You get a small bowl for $14 and they do not have any hoisin sauce :(  If you really want pho I would drive off the strip to chinatown or down flamingo road...",

The breakfast is way too overpriced to even attempt to get something. I ordered a bagel and cream cheese and that was $4.50!! Get over yourself Palazzo, you are supposed to be a high class establishment, but the service we had in the morning was terrible. She was a middle aged blonde, who just was overwhelmed and not polite. We had a large party and had spent A LOT of money this weekend. The service we had in the private room for dinner was much better and friendly, she should take some tips from them on how to act.  I give the higher rating for the night service only. The veggie burger was the worse thing I've had in a long time. The salad was disappointing and Thai rolls were not great. I wouldn't go back! I would say the decor and ambiance is nice especially in the private room.",

We ordered two mojitos - as a person who loves to drink and make mojitos at home these mojitos were just ok. They definitely were not worth the price which was 12 bucks a piece. I think they were way to heavy on the simple syrup heavy and not enough lime or club soda. And please tell me why this drink costs 12 bucks - it should be half that.   The did serve complementary warm bread which was very good.  For the entrees I had the Southwestern Salad and it was just fantastic. I liked  everything about it. It was chopped style so everything was cubed or rectangular shaped :). The salad dressing was fantastic. There was one item that I am not sure was supposed to be in the salad. I feel like either jacima or apple slices were put in it and that was not on the ingredients but it was delicious and I shared with my hubby and we ate every last bite of it.   For our entries the hubby had the Wood Grilled B.B.Q. Burger with french fries. The burger was really big, and he liked it but he wasn't raving about it. I think he wished he ordered something different because when I asked him if he liked his dinner he said it was good but mine was REALLY good.  The service was good.",

We came here today on July 4th around 7pm and this cafe was quite busy.   It took nearly 20 min before we got our regular coffee.   This is something that should've taken no longer than 5 minutes but there were only 2 people working at the time.   They did their best to work as fast as they possible can but there were too many customers and we were getting frustrated.   Our show was going to start at 7:30pm and we were very worried because it took forever to get our drinks.   I noticed customers yelling and showing their frustration to the cashier and the lady making the drinks.   These customers also had a show to catch and service was unacceptably slow.   I couldn't believe why management didn't have more people working here on a holiday weekend.   Both the coffee and chocolate chip cookie was delicious.   I liked how the cookie was soft and had bits of walnut with just the right amount of chocolate chips.   5 stars for my order.   5 stars and two thumbs up to the two people working there tonight.   0 stars to the Grand Lux management!",

I had enough left over to take back and eat when I was starving during the middle of the night. It was very satisfying. The mangos were sweet and the chili-lime vinaigrette went well with it.

Consider this place a little of a fancified version of the Cheesecake Factory with some better menu items but still the same HUGE portions.

We've been going to have breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the past 5 days that we've been here.The receptionist was telling us there is a waiting time for 25 minutes which we thought is reasonable. We waited over 50 minutes to be seated but they were calling tables of 4,6, and 7 when we were waiting twice as long as them. I went to front desk asked for assistance a numerous amount of times and they kept saying 10-15 minutes. They said there is nothing they can do and we have to wait longer than normal. Let me add the fact that my sister is handicap & we needed to be seated sooner than anyone else. I asked for a supervisor, who came in about 10 minutes. We went from waiting for 25 minutes to 50 minutes to about AN HOUR AND A HALF!!! Is this a joke?!  Marty, the so-called supervisor, was a complete BITCH. She came to us and said, \"if you don't want to wait then you can leave, go! I'm trying to put tables together and people don't want to leave.\" At the time she was telling me these things, her hostess's were seating parties of 2,4,6 and 7... How does that even make sense?? We've been waiting for an hour and a half and you're prioritizing other customers rather than seating a table of 10 who have been coming to you guys for YEARS?? The \"supervisor\" turned around to my dad & shoved her hand in his face and said, sir I'm telling you one more time, if you don't want to wait then leave! My dad got extremely frustrated but kept his cool and continued to be nice. Therefore: he went into the restaurant to check the open seats and there was a bunch! So he took pictures and showed the supervisor where she turned around and said \"you're telling me how to run my business?!\" Uh, you clearly don't know how to run a business when you have a bunch of open seats and are making us wait for over an hour and a half.. when she saw those pictures, she was asking my dad where those seats are.. Lol, what an amazing supervisor with such a great staff. (Complete sarcasm) At the end of all of this, Marty shoved her hand in my dads face, did the bitch walk and completely ignored my dad when he was speaking to her. Oh and we ended up leaving because they still made us wait :). NEVER will we ever go to the Grand Lux Cafe in the Palazzo. They're customer service SUCKS! Goodbye to Marty & the staff!",

I think it is owned by the same people who own The Cheesecake Factory because the decor and the vibe of the restaurant reminded me so much of that restaurant.   The atmosphere was very luxurious with marble or granite counter tops and bars...very nice.  The menu was huge with a lot of different items. They even had a late night menu because the restaurant was open 24 hours a day.  The food was so good and it wasn't overly expensive for a Las Vegas restaurant. The wait was not very long as it is a huge restaurant. The wait staff was decent and was very knowledgeable about menu items.   During our breakfast, the waitress had suggested the banana pecan pancakes with the home made caramel syrup. I am so happy that I ordered them because it was amazing. The pancakes were fluffy and fresh. My friend ordered the Red Velvet pancakes and felt sick when he was finished because they were so decadent....but he loved it!   I suggest The Grand Lux Cafe for large groups or families who are looking for a delicious meal that isn't too expensive. So many options to chose from, everyone will be pleased.",

I was waiting for her to come back and check on us, and to ask us how it was but she never asked!! She also didn't tell us that we over ordered.   The best part of the meal was the chicken pot pie. The crust was very soft and crunchy and the soupy insides were delicious. I would come back just for the chicken pot pie.  Another saving point of this place is that it is open 24/7. My friend was able to get some pizza late at night to feed us cause of our drunchies.",

The hash browns were just a shredded potato, like the type you would get in a Denny's. The eggs were greasy. The bacon was just ok. The toast was very good.",

For being on the casino floor, it is not smokey or noisy at all, and my only complaint might have been the occasional flashing of bright lights by the nearby slot machines. (We were on the window side table which was a nice, comfortable booth.)  Our server Chris was very nice, friendly and attentive, and the house-made veggie burger I had tasted great. Everything seemed to come in good sized portion (I could not finish my food and took half of it home) and the prices are very reasonable.  Since they are open for breakfast, lunch, dinner and late night dining, I am sure I will be visiting soon again. Oh, and Palazzo has a free wifi, which is an added bonus!",

My fiance and I had a great time at Las Vegas until we come to this facility for lunch.  I come to GLC at The Palazzo also because we stay here for the weekend and wanted to grab something to eat nearby.  I was served by someone who did not give clear explanation to what I ordered.  My fiance order orange juice (non-refillable) for $5.50!!  The brunch menu she ordered was reasonably price at $10 for hashbrown, scrambled egg, toast and ham.  However, when I thought it suppose to come with sausage and when I asked, the waitress brought us a separate plate of sausage...  but I did not know it was an additional side order cost of $5.95!!  My lunch came out to be $41 for two!!  It may not seem a lot, but consider I ordered waffle with strawberries ($11) and coffee ($4) for myself, this is one expensive lunch.  I will never forget the price of a glass of orange juice (champagne glass) costed me $5.50!!!  NOT TO MENTION, the service was slow and was absent at times.  I would recommend going to the GLC at The Venetian instead.  At least I did get service for the same price.  Note:  I have gone to GLC at The Venetian many times and have enjoyed the food and service at this facility.",

I have been to this place a few times, always ordered something different and for the most part the food was relatively satisfying. I will have to say that this past time that I went, it was very much not appealing. My order did not come out right at all. I ordered the omelet with the chose of 3 things to go inside. I chose artichoke, mushroom, spinach, on an egg white omelet with an additional bacon inside. The omelet comes with hash brown. Not only did my hash brown taste bad, it was burnt, crispy, and my omelet did NOT have my bacon. My friend was so upset with the turn out of my food we called over the server and they fixed my food and there was no charge on the additional \"bacon\". I was the last person to finish eating. It was a fail. If you go to Grand Lux, don't order anything too complicated for them to understand. It could come out bad. -_-",

They are open 24 hours, so you can have breakfast, lunch or dinner, and of course a full bar. One day we woke up late of course, after a night of really hard parting Vegas style,and we go there for my first meal of day , craving the great breakfast buffet, but is was no longer being serve, but they have in their lunch menu omelets, egg sandwiches and even Belgian waffles.

If you don't feel like eating cheap fast food but want something good for an affordable price, Grand Luxe is the place to be! Large portions which lasted us until dinner for about an average of $10! I had a tequila drink, forgot the name, but it had patron in it and was very smooth and fruity. We ordered the fried calamari appetizer for the 2 of us and they gave us a lot! We ate so much we were almost full by the time we got our entrees. I ordered some lasagna dish, they make it differently than other lasagnas but i was too full to enjoy the fantastic flavors that i had to togo 2/3 of it! my bf had some sort of cobb salad and it looked so appealing a random came up to us and asked what he ordered. I'll definitely be coming back here on my next Vegas trip, hopefully sometime within the next few weeks!",

Since we stayed in the Palazzo... I went to the Grand Lux Cafe downstairs.Kinda like a Cheesecake Factory. The menu had the same sort of feel. I wonder if they're sister restaurants??   I ordered take out from the bakery around the corner... ended up choosing a bacon cheeseburger with fries... no thousand island sauce and no onions with a side of ranch. The cute young cashier told me it'd be about 15 minutes. I went into the casino to gamble and pass time... and guess what?! I won $127 on the Wheel of Fortune $1 machine. AWESOME!!! Cashed out and went back to the bakery and the cashier told me it'd be a little wait longer... no problem! I called my Mom to tell her the good news and then called my boyfriend as well. We were on the phone for quite some time... and the employee started fixing the chairs and closing the door so I had to ask if the bakery was closed?! He said yes but that my take out order was coming. I hung up with my boyfriend... walked around the casino to eye out a machine... went back, and still no food! By then I was hungry and frustrated... looked at my phone and the ticket and realized it had been almost an hour! WTF?! Went in to the restaurant and spoke to the host and said I wanted a refund... even he was trippin that it had been almost an hour! I guess since I was gambling and on the phone the time just flew! As soon as the manager came out and I gave him my ticket the employee from the bakery brought my food out... almost at the exact same time! Once the manager looked at my ticket and realized it had been almost an hour he gave me the food and said \"keep it and follow me for a refund\". Score!   Got my refund, got my burger and fries, and enjoyed it upstairs in my suite. JUICY burger! HUGE patty. I mean HUGE! I love me a good burger and lemme tell you... it was ALMOST worth the one hour wait LOL! I'll be back again, but no take out!",

The warm sourdough bread keeps you occupied, but consider an appetizer for extra entertainment. Might I suggest the Asian Nachos? You get several deep fried won tons about 4 inches in diameter topped with chicken, sour cream, guac, and the obligatory Asian sweet/sour sauce. Don't forget the upside-down bowl-molded heap of fried rice in the middle for your [dipping?] pleasure.  Now, to the main course items. It took me a while to figure out what types of food this place served, because they had a little bit of everything which leads to a menu that's too big for their own good. Nevertheless, the food tasted good--a bit simple, but full of flavor.  Giant portions, so they were definitely catering to the American crowd.  I had the cedar plank bbq salmon. A big fillet of salmon coated with a bbq glaze and then cooked atop a cedar plank, which is then lined with mashed potato and dressed on the side with a corn succotash and 3 sad looking onion rings. The salmon was delicious, and I could barely finish the mashed potatoes because there was so much.",

It reminded me of when we were in elementary school again, but it tasted 100x better!  For brunch, I had the express brunch, which is basically a little buffet of breakfast foods.

I like the Indochine Shrimp and Chicken- very mild flavor curry and has dried cherries and apricots. This is my favorite dish here.  I've tried an extensive part of the menu and all have been nice, but I still stick to my favorite Indochine.   I come mainly for the beignets. The other location in Venetian doesnt do beignets so you have to come to the Palazzo location for them!! I found that out the sad way of being psyched for some and I had to settle on cakes for dessert at the Venetian one. Beignets are crispy outside and soft and eggy interior  with 3 sauces: raspberry, chocolate and vanilla cream. I tend to like doing the creme mixed with raspberry sauce the best. Chocolate is good and rich so I tend to mix it with the creme sauce as well. To me the combo is better than eating each sauce by itself. Takes 20 minutes to make so order this when selecting entrees or youre SOL at the end of the meal unless you sit and wait.  Long time ago they had bomb napoleons with fresh fruit and all the locations took it away. Boo! They did it right so its a shame they pulled it.  I think for the dessert alone I will say I'm a fan and give it 4 stars.",

My boyfriend ordered a bunch of tapas - calimari, duck triangles, and ahi ceviche and I had a breakfast sandwich which came with a generous portion of hash browns (yum!)

And our waitress seemed a little odd at first... well, she was a little odd, but maybe that was just cause she was psychic. She was really on the ball and knew what we needed before we did.  The bread they bring you at the beginning was REALLY crusty. Which I am all over, but if you are not a fan of crunchy things, you may want to just go for the moist center and leave the crust.  The food was excellent. I had the Pizza Margherita and Salad lunch special, and my wife had the Pasta Telephono and salad lunch special. The bleu cheese and vinaigrette dressings were fabulous. Good bleu cheese is hard to come by, but this place nailed it.  The pasta was cheesy and delicious. Came in a pink sauce (tomato + cream). If you are a fan of mac and cheese, you will probably like the pasta telephono.  The pizza Margherita was really fantastic. I'm the kind of person to be disappointed by pizza since we make it at home from scratch, but this pizza lived up to my standards.  And, did I mention the entire meal was vegetarian? We didn't even notice until afterward. I love that! Vegetarian without being in your face about it.  And, did I mentions the portions are generous? More than enough food!  So color me a fan. I really didn't expect it to be that good. I'm tempted to go again, so maybe I should try the Venetian location next time.",

The bread basket they give in the beginning is probably the best part of the meal. The service is really slow....",

    "text": "My wife and I ate here twice during our most recent trip to Las Vegas.  Yes, this restaurant is very similar to the Cheesecake Factory.  We both loved this restaurant.  If you're looking for a great place with some great food for a great price, you will not be disappointed here.  Like the Cheesecake Factory, there are lots of options for everyone on the menu.  The portion sizes are really good.  You'll get enough food, don't worry.  The free bread was really good.  It was a kind of wheat bread as well as some sourdough.  Loved them both.  Below is a list of what we tried:  Penne alla Vodka:  this isn't on the menu but my wife asked for this instead of the gnocchi with vodka sauce.  It was excellent.  One of the best we've had and we've had a lot.  This is one of my wife's favorite pasta dishes and she loved it.  Caeser salad:  Excellent as well.  Great portion size.  Chicken and Shrimp Jambalaya:  Really good flavor.  I really enjoyed it.  Pasta Tropheo (or something like that) with chicken:  Also very very good.  Delicious.  During our trip, we ate at several Italian places, and we both though the bread and pasta here were better than those other straight up Italian places.  Sadly, if we were staying closer to the Venetian, we might have eaten here a third time.  If you're debating, give it a try.  Also, we never had to wait for a table.",

I've had a couple of things here before on the togo menu; the fettuccini alfredo which taste dry and thick, but the chicken is good if you add it in, could probably feed two people, any of the pizza selections are pretty good, chicken bites are satisfying and will do your stomach some justice before heading out. While dining in, the menu is huge, honestly there is so much to choose from, I kind of see that as a bad thing, makes people take a long ass time to order, but I ordered the Zen noodles which was like thai noodle soup, it was ok, soup was pretty decent, they don't pour all the soup in and leave it in a cup in case you want to poor the rest, it isn't huge, but I didn't expect that it would be.",

Being more objective though, this place is ok.  Owned by The Cheesecake Factory (which explains the massive menu, representing foods of all types), Grand Lux has a little bit of everything, and probably does most of it in an acceptable fashion.  Shared the: -Spring Rolls (Vietnamese Chicken Summer Rolls): pretty tasty, but poorly wrapped.  The paper kept tearing and the food spilled out all over our hands and the plate.   The Max Burger- Their \"greatest hamburger creation!\"  Burger, cheese, bacon, mushrooms, onions, and short ribs. This was the husband's ideas. it was ok. The individual ingredients were hard to single out as far as taste goes.    Even though the restaurant tries to be a fun, hip place, there were still the standard 3am Las Vegas servers.  Our waiter must have been at least 65 and wanted to be anywhere else but there.  What really surprised me about this place though, was the next morning (and by morning, I mean around 11am) there was an absurdly long line!  Those people should've gone to Dos Caminos (see review)!",

I had the chicken parm / shrimp scampi combo w/ angel hair pasta w/ marinara.  Outstanding and for $19.80. My wife had the spicy calamari salad.  The calamari was fried to perfection with a puffy, crisp batter that enhanced the flavor of the calamari. Be warned that the serving sizes are large!  We will be back!",

She kept forgetting to bring accompaniments that we had asked for with our food. She would never stop back at the table to check to make sure everything was okay either. When we finally had been waiting for ten minutes with our empty plates in front of us, she came over. I explained that we were already late to go back to work and needed our check right away. Mind you that we were late because we were always waiting on her to show up. When we gave her our payment, we watched her drop it next to a register and then go to another two tables to refill drinks and check on them. So clearly we were late getting back to work and got the crap end of the stick on service yesterday. Needless to say that when we return for lunch, I will make sure to not sit in her section. Horrible!!",

Same bread as the other Lux, and the same menu except for desserts (they make home made beniegts and pineapple upside down cake). I also had Asian nachos both times which I swear are ingenious and DELICIOUS. Yes, Asian nachos-wonton skins (instead of chips), a light amount of cheese, scallions and a delicious spicy/sweet peanut sauce with a little wasabi \"cream\" which wasn't very noticeable but made a for just enough heat to send these over the top. Our first night, a bunch of us shared different things from calamari to said nachos to salad and burgers.   Our second time here, we were seated next to folks from San Angelo and Fort Worth Texas and started sharing butter/bites of desserts with the other tables and seemed to talk and talk for a long time about having teens, etc.  Desserts are worth it here for sure and though we had the same waitress both times (she was a bit weird), we would come back here again for sure.",

Probably has one of the larger menus with variety compared to other places on the strip and best of all the amazing food is on the affordable side.  Open late, the Grand Lux Cafe makes a great Plan B too if you run out of daylight and still need to get your food fix on.

She checked with the kitchen guys and told us that we can order them and it's gonna take them about 15 min to make. Then our waitress Christina came to us and I told her that I wanna switch back to burgers. She said I cannot do it since they've already started my order. What?!?!? You gave me the wrong info in the first place and now you don't wanna do anything to keep your customers happy? She was very rude and unprofessional with a very bad attitude that is not supposed to take place on the 5-star property such as the Venetian/Palazzo.

Poor guy was hungry and watching everyone eat. We came back a few days ago thinking that's was just one incident and these things have never happened here before. Oh boy! Were we wrong. The same waitress was servicing us. This time no one got any food. We waited for over an hour. No one came to check on us or realize we were there for over an hour. We asked a guy who brought food out for the table behind us. He went to check for us. Maybe 5 minutes later a manager stop by saying our food was coming. The waitress came back to take our order again. Really? Seriously? We walked out of this place after waiting for over an hour with an empty stomach. Horrible service.

The Grand Lux at the Beverly Center is a 5-star restaurant...therefore, it is staffed with only the finest servers and hosts. The servers at the Beverly location are trained to know the menu by heart, give recommendations, and even engage in conversation to make the dining experience more memorable. This location at the Palazzo has none of that. Yes, the food is still really good like at the Beverly location, but the service just plain sucks.   They always forget to bring out the free bread that all the Grand Lux and CheeseCake Factory locations ALWAYS provide for free.   The servers don't even say anything and even seem like they have difficulty articulating words in their heads. I know places like WalMart will hire mentally disabled people because the government pays them to do so, I have recently come to the conclusion that this place does the same thing.   I know that the Cheesecake Factory owns the Grand Lux and that the Grand Lux is supposed to be their high end restaurants, but in my opinion the Cheesecake Factory is far superior in food and in service. I recommend going across the street to the Cheesecake Factory at the Forum Shops, it has much better customer service and food.",

The decor is quite similar and maybe some of the dishes are comparable, but the prices are a bit steeper.  Since it was kinda late morning, I was still in the mood for breakfast.  I ordered an all meat omelette and some coffee.  The waiter was quite attentive as my coffee and water was always topped up.  When my food came, I couldn't believe the omelette that came from this place.  The egg looked like a sheet if yellow plastic wrapping around chopped pieces of meat.  It looked like they were cooked separately rather than together as it should be.  After a few bites, I couldn't take it anymore and had to tell the waiter this was unacceptable.  It was also missing the shredded cheddar and he recognized it.  When the new omelette came out, it actually looked like egg this time.  The sad part is that I'm not too stuffed to eat any of it and wasn't about to take this home or back to the room.    I give the service 5 stars, but the restaurant 3 stars.  The meat was quite delish, but how can you screw up an omelette AND forget the cheese?",

We asked the hostess if our reservation was still available and she said yes!  We were so excited we made it on time, yet after that, we had to wait because I heard the hostess mumbled to another girl that \"She totally forgot\" about our group -__-.  How do you forget if people made reservations?  We had to wait about 5 minutes and was then seated.  Our waiters were attentive with our group of 8 people.  This is a higher end than Cheesecake Factory and beware, when you look at the menu, it is massive which will make you very indecisive!!  I wasn't too hungry so I ordered the   Tomato and Fresh Mozzarella  Cherry Tomatoes, Garlic, Mozzarella, Fontina and Parmesan Cheeses. This was only $5.95.  I asked if they could add basil on it as well and they were kind enough to do that and it was the perfect size for little me!  Seafood Salad  Lump Crab, Shrimp, Avocado, Tomato, Corn, Green Beans, Egg, Celery and Green Onion Over a Bed of Crisp Romaine Tossed with Our \"Louis\" Dressing.  I had some of my friends salad and this was super refreshing and filling!  Potato Gnocchi with Vodka Sauce  Simply Delicious Housemade Gnocchi Tossed in Our Creamy Vodka Sauce and Fresh Basil.  Omg this was delicious....after a few bites!  I recommend ordering this but please SHARE with all the people at your table!  It can get kind of sickening after a few bites because it is so rich!!  Asian Pear Martini  Absolut Vanilia Vodka, Pear, Passion Fruit and Sake. Great martini if you want something refreshing and sweet!  A little pricey though...about $13.  Overall, great place to eat with a  variety of choices!!    NOTE: -Opened late for all you drunkies ;) -5 minute grace period if you happen to be a tad late",

Grand Lux Cafe is located inside of the Palazzo Hotel, which was very convenient for me and my group since that's where we were staying. Great place for us to dine because we were able to just get ready in our hotel room, then go downstairs for dinner before heading out to the clubs or walking the strip. Price is great for what you get; just expect Cheesecake Factory pricing with the same big type of portion size as well! Great for sharing entrees, which is exactly what us 10+ girls did.

Same type of menu (lots an lots of choices) and similar quality and taste, which is not to say it's bad but very standard.  This meal, I had the Sunday night pasta which was a solid 3 stars.  Knew exactly what I was guessing.  I'm sure I'll be back on future trips.",

It's an American Asian fusion cuisine and I've eaten here several times. The Asian nachos is unique and is a crispy wonton with mozzarella cheese, wasabi, chicken and a sweet goner sauce. The garlic shrimp pasta is good too and does not feel too heavy. The Indochine shrimp and chicken pasta is a curry dish with rice and comes a bit spicy. There's burgers, sandwiches and an alcohol list to choose from. It's in a nice Hotel and casino too.",

You get free bread for meals. They bring it out warm in a basket. We liked the sourdough bread but for some reason when the waiter came by she took our half finished break basket and said she'd come back with more... But she came back with wheat instead. Heart break. But overall the meal was decent. I had the clam chowder which was a little bit too salty but over all still good. Especially when you dip the bread in.   In the morning we came back. They have breakfast buffet until 12:45. It's just a basic breakfast buffet but I rather order off the menu. The Spanish rose is really good.   Service can be a bit slow. Especially when they're dealing with a crowd. So I guess if you care you should just go with the buffet.",

    "text": "I always go to this grand lux at the palazzo because I work here, usually here during my lunch breaks, or if I need a quick bite to eat.   The reason I'm writing a review on them is because my most recent visit was not so pleasant. I usually sit at the bar because it's fast and convenient for me, I'm usually in and I'm out within 40 minutes. This time around wasn't the case. Although their food is amazing, always so filling, their customer service was not all that great today. Maybe our server Christopher (Filipino, with glasses) is new that's why he wasn't so attentive, but regardless, you're working at a casino on the strip.  Anyways, as soon as we ordered I let him know we work at the casino and he asked for our ID cards. Which is weird because they never really ask us, because we have our casino badges on.   Got our food, we ordered the lunch special of a small pizza and a side of salad. Mine was perfect, I had the bbq chicken pizza and my coworker ordered the margarita pizza, which was a little burnt. Oh well, it happens.   Soon as we got the check, we left. I normally like going when my regular server John is working. He's always so helpful and even suggests new things on the menu. I hope Christopher improves his services, that way it won't matter which server I get.",

Rich was warm and accommodating but most of all reassuring as he has clearly dealt with nervous wedding couples before.  For the price, there really is no comparison. They are one of the most reasonably priced restaurants for large groups on the strip. But that doesn't mean their food isn't good. On the contrary, it satisfied our notoriously hard to please Korean and Chinese families. It truly was delicious food that wasn't overseasoned or too heavy or portioned too large (or too small).  The fudge cake dessert was the real topper and people couldn't get enough of it.  The staff that night was incredible. Extremely helpful while staying completely out of the way of all the action.  If you are looking a place to have your wedding reception dinner, I'd definitely check out the Grand Lux Palazzo. We are over the moon satisfied with our experience on all fronts.",

    "text": "You know that problem you have when you go to Cheesecake Factory and you simply cannot decide what you want because everything looks good?  Multiply that by five when you come to Grand Lux Cafe.  Literally, the menu is a Cheesecake Factory menu on steroids.  It's always great to have choices, but I was literally looking at the menu for 10 minutes because I just wanted to eat everything on the menu!  American, European, Asian food is laid out to bare.  After finally deciding that it was probably a good idea to not bomb myself to death since I was going to Marquee later that night, I settled on the shaking beef and caramel chicken combo platter with some roast beef cheese fries.  Beef was cooked very well, chicken was tasty.  The quality of the ingredients was top notch, you know you're getting freshness here.  Typical large Cheesecake Factory portions.  Obviously not the cheapest, but it's no more expensive than a regular Cheesecake Factory and it's about on par with affordable Las Vegas Strip dining.  Just like Cheesecake Factory, if you want to have a good meal and not feel ripped off, Grand Lux is definitely the spot to go.  Whether I'd come here for the sole purpose of eating here is another matter, since I only came because I was staying at Palazzo.  But if I had to placate everyone in a party, I'd probably take this.",

    "text": "My friends and I came here for brunch twice during our recent trip and were disappointed both times. The quality of the food, presentation, and ambiance were all good, but service and selection were a problem.  The first time we came, we arrived at 11 and ordered breakfast - we had our hearts set on the chilaquiles and the churro french toast. Our waiter didn't tell us that breakfast was over until he went to put in our order and the computer wouldn't accept it. We had to go through the whole process of reading that 10 page menu twice. We thought breakfast didn't end under after 12, but apparently that only applied to the buffet, not ordering from the actual menu. Fine, ok, misunderstanding and we were willing to let it go.  The next day we came back with more than an hour to spare before breakfast ended. We ordered, and again, our waiter (different one than the previous day) told us that he went to the computer and they were completely out of french toast. He couldn't have told us this when we ordered?? So we had to go through the whole ordering process again, twice. What kind of restaurant runs out of food with more than an hour of service left to go? Apparently they order supplies based on last year's orders...but if you run out, and you can't record someone's order because the computer won't let you, then your order is always an underestimate? We were really annoyed by the way this was handled from a staff and administrative level.  I would not go back here. If you're not picky about what you want to eat, you'll be fine. I know what I like and I'm picky, so it's not easy for me to be flexible when they screw up.",

I had the spicy carnitas sandwich (shredded roast pork with avocado, cilantro, black beans, onion, and a freshly made red chili sauce sort of like salsa on ciabatta bread). I wasn't sure what to expect due to the varied menu but this tasted like something out of an excellent Tex Mex restaurant and the chili sauce had the right spices and flavor. It comes with fries but after several days of Vegas eating I figured a salad might be a good idea so I subbed a side salad w their vinegar dressing at no charge. I also tried the fried pickles which were okay but nothing special and I'd probably skip them next time.  Service was friendly and I'll come back here to try more of their menu. It's the perfect place for a good meal when you don't want five star Vegas prices.",

I'm bumping Grand Lux Cafe up to four stars though because of their sweets.  I had their salted caramel pudding, which I very much enjoyed since I love me some salted caramel!  I also had a coupon for free beignets which came out warm and very tasty :)  Their entrees get about three stars, but their desserts take it up to four for me and are the stars of the show here!",

    "text": "We dined here for breakfast because we were staying at Palazzo. The breakfast selections were decent, although a but pricey for basic items. I am giving the food a 3 out of 5. Service was less than 3, about a 2. Our waiter Donato was very slow and took a long time to bring items to the table. By the time the regular maple syrup arrived, one of the people in our group had already finished their waffle. My toast also took awhile to come out. My eggs were cold by the time it arrived. Tip...when people already have their plates, do not stop to do other things or stand behind the computer. Bring the items needed for people to eat their meals while warm. I am sure we will come back for the convenience, but make sure to not have that particular server.",

Service is a little slow (takes a while for food to come out).  I come here purely for the Belgian Waffle. I swear it's the BEST waffle ever. It's very crispy on the outside, but so soft and light once you bite into it. And the sauce! Oh my, it's to die for. It has a kind of caramel-y + butterscotch taste. Not your typical maple syrup. The waffle is the same if you decide to go for the Fried Chicken & Waffles dish instead. Chicken is also very yummy.  I can't comment much else for their other dishes, since there are just too many options to choose from. This is always a must stop place in Vegas, even if I'm not staying at Palazzo!",

The steak was about 8 inches long, and surrounded by somewhat hard but fresh broccoli, green beans, and sweet potatoes.    But before I dug into the chopped sirloin, I reveled in buttered slices of the Grand Lux's renowned complimentary sourdough bread; enjoyed a few of Diane's addictive Pot Roast Cheese Fries; and at length polished off a large app of Crispy Thai Shrimp & Chicken Spring Rolls and a Mini Luxor Salad with Garlic Croutons and Blue Cheese Dressing.  The Spring Rolls were filled with thinly diced shrimp and chicken that tasted great joined with a few carrot slivers and a single mint leaf before being enveloped in lettuce leaves and then dipped in a very vibrant Thai Sweet-Hot Chili Sauce.  The salad proved unnecessary, but was otherwise a good small lettuce and tomato-based dish.  Another night savoring fine comfort food at this grand establishment!",

I got the strawberry short cake and they had it ready and deconstructed for me to put together on my own. The molten chocolate cake is made to order, so you have to wait 20 minutes or so. It works out since there's the casino right outside of the restaurant so that's how we killed time.   Desserts were delicious and worth the wait. I'll have to try the restaurant the next time I'm in Vegas.",

Our waitress, however, was awesome and attentive and was very welcoming.  I got the artichoke spinach dip to start and had the chicken Madeira for my entree, per her recommendation.  Needless to say I had to send the Madeira back.  It was just drenched in the sauce and the flavors were a bit too overwhelming.  This is my brothers favorite place and would probably give it another go, but with something else.",

Slightly arrogant, a little geeky yet still helpful. He was an interesting character to say the least.   Service aside, the Grand Lux is a sister restaurant to Cheesecake Factory. Similar menu items and always large portions. The co-habby and I often opt for the \"small plate\" version and my favorite dish is the Salmon Picatta over a bed of mashed potatoes served with a caper-filed, tangy sauce. I can't remember what the co-habby had because he was too busy laughing at our waiter while impersonating him. He's going to hell, lol. But great comedy relief...we truly thought he was acting in a starring role and we were the extras. But I digress.  The menu is vast and if you do order a regular entree, I suggest splitting it with a friend as the portions are monstrous. Beautiful decor, plenty of options for different appetites and reasonably priced plates. Definitely one of our favorite stops when in Vegas.",

Only thing I didn't care too much for was the Asian nachos the peanut sauce was just a bit over whelming a little less goes a long way. The depth of flavor is strong so it took over more; than tasting the other ingredients as a blend as a Asian nacho.",

This was enough food to eat, then take left overs big enough for my husband and myself to eat the next day.   This morning I had coffee and baileys, and we split the breakfast sandwich (came with hash browns which were exceptional! ).  The only reason it lost a star ( four not five ) was the drinks. They were  bit too sweet and lacked any alcohol taste ( the cocktails ) and the coffee was so strong it took 2 sweet n low plus a sugar in the raw. No worries - this happens a bit too often in Vegas so keep a mini bottle handy to top it off !",

But do get the Margherita Pizza and Roast Turkey and Brie Sandwich. The pizza was made perfectly and I loved the crust. The sandwich had thick slices of turkey and the flavors were well balanced. 5.

    "text": "Grand Lux Cafe is amazing! After spending the day at the TAO day club, my boyfriend and I wanted to dine at a decent but reasonably priced restaurant for dinner. We looked up various restaurants and decided on the Grand Lux Cafe.   The restaurant is dimly lit and provides a romantic atmosphere for your meal. The staff are very friendly and service is exceptional. We were given detailed explanations of each dish we were interested in and our waitress had a great attitude throughout her service. We ended up deciding on Crispy Fish and Chips and the Cafe Beef Wellingtons, Wellingtons as a suggestion by our waitress. Their portions are extremely large, making the prices very, very reasonable! The food was absolutely delicious and it hit the spot after a long day at the pool in the sun.   The Fish and Chips were fried perfectly: crispy on the outside but extremely tender and moist on the inside. Once we took a bite of the Beef Wellingtons, we knew why the waitress insisted we try this dish out. It was one of the best Beef Wellingtons I've ever had - The pastry on the exterior was mouth-wateringly flaky and added a wonderful crisp to the Wellingtons. However, the steak on the inside was the real winner of the show. It was cooked medium-rare and was juicy and flavored with just the right amount of savoriness without taking away from the meaty flavor. Even the sides of the dishes were great. Fish and Chips came with fries and various dipping sauces and the Beef Wellingtons came with sides of mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts, both delicious and paired well with the Wellingtons.   Service was great, the waitress who served us was very light-hearted and made our dinner very pleasant. Atmosphere is great for a casual dinner with family or significant other. I really enjoyed my experience at Grand Lux Cafe and will make a point for me to visit next time I'm in Vegas!",

    "text": "We were searching for a good breakfast spot one morning. We were originally looking for another restaurant in Palazzo but after 15 mins of searching and not being able to find it, we asked a security guard if he knew where it was. He gave us directions but recommend that we go to Grand Lux instead because the food is better and less pricy. I'm glad he gave us the recommendation because the food was great.   Grand Lux is like a better version of Cheesecake Factory. The Breakfast menu is pretty large. You can either go with the breakfast buffet for $20 or order from the menu. We chose to order off the menu because I wanted waffles and my boyfriend wanted a crab omelet and never was an option on the buffet. The chicken & waffles are EVERYTHING! It's served with pecans and maple butter sauce. It tasted like butter pecan! My boyfriend enjoyed his crab and asparagus omelet. The portion sizes are huge and we couldn't even finish our meals.   Service is great as well. We were seated and served promptly. Our food came to the table within 10 mins. I liked that it was open 24 hours. If we wanted food late at night and other places around us was closed, this was a great go-to option.",

Unless you get lucky and get a booth, the tables are packed in so tightly it feels as if you are eating at a communial table. Kind of awkward. Server seemed in a hurry and aggressive. Joes Scramble for breakfast was incredibly bland and sad at $15. The ground beef clearly had no seasoning at all and just made for lot of chewing boring food. At least it came out really hot but I had to douse it with Tobasco to get through itm My gf now questions my choice of restaurants lol Yeah never again.",

I've read reviews saying this place was just your basic go-to place to fill up on food and sustenance before/after partying at Vegas. I admit I did not believe it would be that great when my group walked into the restaurant. It was 12am midnight and we had just come back from a concert, hungry and tired. Grand Lux Cafe is literally inside the Palazzo. We sat outside with the great view of slot machines and the smell of cigarette smoke wavering around us. mHhmmm deliciousness (sarcasm).   SERVICE -Not too shabby. We had a huge group and they quickly accommodated us. It was also a weird time to eat so it wasn't crowded or anything, but it wasn't like we were the only ones there either.  -Food took 20+ minutes to get but our party size was around 12 people or so. Keep your group small if you are in a hurry.  LE MENU -Cobb Salad was perf. Lettuce was juicy and sweet. Bacon was amazing. Loved the sliced cherry tomatoes. Avocado portions were generous (that's what I'm talking about). Chicken wasn't too dry. Salad dressing was perfection. It came out on a huge dish and I ate it all!  -Friends ordered off of the breakfast menu, so your standard hash browns, potatoes, corn beef, etc. -Jambalaya, Asian wonton tacos, pastas, just to name a few of the other dishes my friends ordered.   PROS -Good easy access food when you're hungry -Portions are generous  CONS -the smoke X__X",

It's a pretty large menu, and there's a lot more for me to try :)  Wait time was not long at all, though we had a party of 7. Service in the beginning was ok. We waited quite a while to get waters and the menu. But after our order was taken, everything was smooth sailing from there. Our waiter checked up on us quite often and didn't take long when we requested for things.   I ordered the clam chowder. It was really good. I didn't have to add salt or pepper or crackers either. It was so creamy and thick, and perfect for a hang over. Well, it worked for me ;p   The second dish I ordered was the Kobe meatballs. Comes with two. They were HUGE! As it being Kobe beef, my expectations were high. But, the meatballs did fall short. They were good, but could've been better. The meat could have used more seasoning. The marinara sauce that came with it was ok (kind of tasted like spaghetti sauce from a jar) and the cheese melted on top of the meatballs lacked taste. The portion was quite large, though. It's perfect for sharing!",

    "text": "To start, the Mrs., ordered the: Pot Roast Cheese Fries - French fries topped with chunks of tender pot roast, smothered with gravy and creamy cheddar cheese sauce - $7.50.   I ordered the buffalo chicken bites - chicken breast, cheese and spicy buffalo sauce fried crisp with blue cheese - $6.95.  For dinner, the Mrs., order crab cakes which are served with mustard sauce - $13.50.   I ordered the shrimp scampi - sauteed with white wine, lemon, garlic, fresh tomato, basil, parsley and a touch of cream over pasta.   The buffalo chicken bites were stellar. They were really flavorful and the blue cheese sauce was nearly angelic and that's coming from a guy who doesn't particularly like blue cheese. The pot roast fries were equally good and we were happy to see that the restaurant was generous with the pot roast, which was quite tender.   I was disappointed with my first order of shrimp scampi, as quite a bit of the noodles were hard and stuck together. The waiter changed it with no problem. While I did get another fresh plate, it wasn't bursting with flavor like the shrimp scampi I had at their sister restaurant the Cheesecake Factory. The noodles and cream sauce was good, but the shrimp was a bit of a let down. They just seemed really bland. In my experience shrimp scampi can be pretty hit or miss. I'm guessing the seasoning of the shrimp lacked enough salt.   My wife really enjoyed the crab cakes and I love that we like to share, because I did as well. The outside was really crisp, but the filling was really cakey and you could taste the crab meat.   Service wasn't stellar, as there were a couple of hiccups with our drink order and silverware wasn't on the table to start, but that was quickly alleviated. What we did learn was that a lot of waiters here in Vegas don't hear the word \"seltzer\" when it asked for that type of water. When I said \"soda\" water, they knew what I meant. So I give my waiter a pass on that.  All in all, it was a good experience and the food was great with the exception of the shrimp scampi.",

    "text": "I ate here for breakfast twice while I was staying at the Palazzo. They have two Grand Lux Cafes, one at the Venetian and one at Palazzo. This review is obviously for the Palazzo. The Grand Lux is from the makers of the Cheesecake Factory. The decor, the outfits, even the to-go bag look just like the ones you would see at Cheesecake Factory, except the restaurant name has been changed. Also, the menu is just as big. I ordered the chicken and waffles one day and the scrambled eggs with hash browns on another day. Both were excellent. Waffle was crisp on the outside and nice and soft on the inside. It came with a maple syrup which wasn't too sweet, which is perfect for me. I don't like syrups that overpower the flavor of the waffle. The waffle was also topped with pecans. The chicken was not your ordinary chicken strips, it was very good, white meat chicken strips. Lightly season and breaded on the outside, fried to a crisp and very juicy on the inside. The salty and sweet combination of the chicken and waffles is an amazing combination. For those of you that haven't tried it, you might think it's crazy, and I did too, until you try it. Do yourself a favor and try it!  The second day I had scrambled eggs with hash browns, which comes with your choice of toast. The eggs were perfect, not too runny, not too dry. The hash browns were nice and crisp and not too oily. Both the waffle and eggs were pretty big too, very cheesecake-esque and although the meals are a bit pricey, it's a lot of food too.   We didn't have to wait more than 5 mins to get seated on either day. Day one was Friday morning at 8:30am, and Saturday was at 10am. The restaurant looks pretty big, so I think that helps alleviate congestion. The also offer an all you can eat buffet for breakfast, but I'm not a big eater in the morning, so I stuck to the menu.   I went to breakfast with my brother and he ordered the Continental Breakfast, which is for $8.95 and it comes with a bowl of assorted fruit pieces, a small croissant, 1 muffin and 1 danish. The croissant, muffin and danish look like something you would get at a gas station convenience store and also tasted that way. I would highly recommend that you stay away from the Continental Breakfast. He only chose it because it was free as part of his room rate. He was staying as part of an American Express Fine Hotels and Resort rate. Check out my pictures for prices on each item!",

We needed an appetizer and drink before The Jersey Boys show at Palazzo so we tried this location.   Great service. The waiter asked if we were going to the show so he was really quick with the drinks and food. Delicious Mai tai and martini.  The potstickers were large and delicious with a wonderful dipping sauce. A super fresh and tasty small chicken Cobb salad was passed between us as well.   This was a great convenient find.",

Here, they do a wonderful job of maximizing a diverse variety of menu items, while still maintaining the highest standard of quality.  You can order anything from breakfast to Asian to Italian to American gourmet influenced meals. Some of my favorites include the Avocado Chipotle Burger and the Wild Mushroom Burger.  The atmosphere and decor is lovely.  High ceilings and a clean open feel make for a very pleasant ambiance.  The service has always been excellent each time I've been no matter how large our party was.  The best part is....you get all of that goodness for pretty reasonable prices.",

I kinda hate Cheesecake Factory's food. I feel like it's gone down over the years and the novelty's worn off. But Grand Lux's food..everything amuses me. Especially their chicken lettuce wraps. I don't like chicken much, definitely not lettuce, but man.  Reasons to jump on the Grand Lux bandwagon:  -chicken lettuce wraps -never a wait -they make me grilled cheese's when I'm drunk even though it's not on the menu -the one actual restaurant on the strip with good food that doesn't cost a paycheck -unlimited bread - short rib grilled cheese sandwich  Confession #2: One tme, when I was so hungover (still drunk) and alone in my room at the Palazzo I called down for takeout and ordered for myself fried calamari, salad, 1/2 sandwich and soup combo, and chicken lettuce wraps, all for less than $30. If there's a cure for the morning-after depression it's laying out a helluva lot of food on my hotel bed and lying down and resting whatever I'm eating on my tummy while I watch tv. BOOM. Sexiness reincarnated.",

Vegas is the land of seafood buffets and supposedly *good* buffets in general. Yet, somehow, we ended up in Grand Lux. TWICE. So bitter.   The food was ... well, it was Grand Lux. It wasn't horrific, but it wasn't anything that you would remember or even think about a day later. Also, since the portions are unnecessarily huge (and, I assure you, you are paying for every ounce of it), we had leftovers so we jokingly asked the waiter if we could put it in the Grand Lux fridge. He said sure and that we could come back and get it later. Total fake-out.  We came back the next day and asked a different waiter for our food. He looked confused and told us that wasn't allowed at all (health violation?). So, I ask, First Waiter, why would you trick a bunch of tourists with promises of potential leftovers? That's just wrong. And mean. And I don't like Grand Lux. Go eat at a buffet. I heard the one at Rio was good, but I wouldn't know, because I was eating at Grand Lux *sob*",

We were seated at their \"patio\" area that's basically on the casino floor (too smokey for our kids)  You can be asked to be seated inside the GIANT dinning room. The menu is very similar to the cheese cake factory (TCF) BECAUSE it is OWNED by them too! The complimentary bread was a crusty wheat different from TCF's two loaves. We ordered the caramel chicken, taste exactly the same as TCF. Kid's menu is exactly the same as well.    Ending to this story- if you want TCF on the strip come here! same portions, similar menu, it's a little less glamorous than the plethora of famous chef establishments but it's a sure thing for a modest price.",

WooHoo!!  I saw the Grand Lux Cafe in the in-room publications for the hotel and saw that they had a miso glazed salmon which I totally missed from The Cheesecake Factory (miso glazed SESAME salmon).  Those were the days.  So I ordered it up along with a Jack and Coke.  That was what caused the one star reduction in my rating.  Too much Coke and not enough Jack.  :)  Not too many people in the place during lunch.  Granted it was 3:30PM when I got there and there are obviously other places to eat but whatever, they all missed out.  The salmon was prepared perfectly.  Moist enough to flake off at the slightest touch from my fork.  When it met my taste buds, it was like they were old friends getting reacquainted again for the first time...they just melted into each other.  The perfect amount of miso glaze topped off the experience but it didn't end because there was another forkful on it's way.  The filet was a very generous portion and by the end of the meal, I was stuffed.  I opted for the brown rice which was perfect.  The usual nuttiness didn't accompany the rice.  I've had this before at home.  It was a jasmine brown rice which, judging by the size of the grain, it seemed this was jasmine or a member of the same family.  The meal also included stir fry vegetables which were awesome.  Lately I've been in a veggie mood so I'm not sure if this influenced my experience.  Whatever it was, the veggie medley was perfect.  Yellow and red bell peppers, sugar pea snaps, edamame, onions, shitake mushrooms stirred up to perfection!  Make it a point to get here when you get to Sin City and can't decide where of the thousands of choices you have to eat.",

We both ordered the biscuits and gravy and it was delish!!! And being from the south and making homemade sausage gravy myself, I can say it was the real deal!!  Our total bill was only about $35. We were able to get in and out in about 45 mins. My only regret is that we found this restaurant on our last day in Vegas!",

Actually, I like this more and wish they had more locations or would put some of this food on the Cheesecake Factory menu...like the shaking beef.  Went here 3 times in 3 days, couldn't get enough.  The best part....no queue like the CF, walk right in.  Watch out for the portions though...huge, and yummy.",

    "text": "AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL.  Let me preface by saying I have eaten at both Grand Lux Cafes and I will NEVER go to this one again. This is purely based on service.  My friend and I went there around 8pm on a Monday night. Not busy at all. We were seated right away. Then we waited 10 minutes for our waiter. He came, didn't introduce himself (is that a Vegas thing? I've realized not that many people do that...), and took our drink orders. My friend ordered a Sprite, and I ordered a berry fizz.  Yes, I realize that it does not take the same amount of time to make a berry fizz as it is to order a Sprite. However, I wasn't expecting the waiter to bring out my friend's Sprite, and then 5 minutes later have my berry fizz come up at the counter, and then watch my berry fizz sit at the counter for a good 15 minutes before he picked it up and brought it to my table. I would have asked him earlier, but he was too consumed watching Sportscenter highlights.  I wasn't eating, but my friend ordered the pot roast. He said it was ok.  Our waiter never checked in on us during our meal, and finally brought us the bill after forever. We learned then that his name was Scott. So Scott, if you're reading this, me and the table next to us thought you were fucking awful.  In the future, I will go to the Venetian and deal with the drunks there before ever going back to the one at the Palazzo ever again.",

We dined at some very \"high end\" places on this trip and they all paled in comparison to GLC in quality, food choices, service, ambiance and of course pricing! This is one of the best places to eat on the strip where you can fill your stomach and not break your bank!  I ordered the turkey club which quite possibly was one of the best ones I have ever had in my life! I had a side of fries, and ordered the sandwich with avocado! They were so delicious, fresh and hot!   My whole meal was under $30 and I ordered a sandwich with avocado, a mimosa and a dozen of the chocolate chip pecan cookies to go! That is a deal anywhere let alone Vegas! Can't wait for the next trip so we can dine there again! I just wish they had them in California!",

    "text": "So I remember going to this place a long time ago and thought it was only okay, but my friend convinced me that it was yummy and that I should return.  This location had no wait on a sunday afternoon and we were seated right away in the corner of the restaurant. Although we were tucked away in the back corner, the server did not forget about us and attended to us immediately. WARNING: portions are big! The three of us ordered three appetizers and three entrees... lets just say we were extremely full and food coma-ing for awhile..   Appetizers: Asian Nachos- Who even thinks of this stuff! crispy wonton chips with chicken, wasabi cream, cheese, and sweet hot peanut sauce with fried rice in the middle. I don't know if these were made for asians or something but damn were these good! The slight hint of wasabi cream really added to the nachos, and adding the fried rice on top of the chip was super asian and delicious.  Brie Wonton with creamy brie cheese, fresh pineapple, and caramelized onion marmalade- this was okay, i expected better. I didn't taste the pineapple in the wonton, and they left the rind on the brie so the taste was kind of bitter. Sauce was good.  Crispy Pepperoni Mini Pizza- they added parmesan slices on top which really added to the pizza in terms of texture and and flavor. Other than that, regular pepperoni pizza.  Entrees: Lunch special salad and pasta carbonara- the pasta was bomb. Yeah you can make pasta at home but the bacon bits, chicken and cheese was super flavorful and tasty. The noodles were also cooked well.   Housemade Pierogies- Pierogies are basically potato dumplings which they made by hand, and they added roasted short rib with mushrooms and onions. Yum. Yeah pierogies are plain and heavy and basic, but it's good comfort food and perfect after a long night.   Avocado Chipotle Cheeseburger- this thing was giant. I asked for medium rare and mushrooms instead of peppers, and it was a giant stacked burger. The cheese was melted all over the place (perfectly) and the meat was cooked the way I wanted it. The avocados were chopped (I expected it to be in slices) and it kept falling all over the place. Really messy dish, but good burger and good fries.   Overall this restaurant is perfect as a heavy lunch or dinner. Definitely exceeded my expectations from what I had last time (which I don't really remember). Total came out to be $71, which is pretty fair as we did order a lot of food.. Would definitely come if staying at Palazzo or Venetian after a long night.",

Every time I'm in Vegas, I HAVE to dine here or at the Venetian location since they're opened 24/7... It just depends on what time I finish drinking and dancing at the club! They also have a take out mini-shop on the side if you'd rather dine in the comfort of your hotel room.  Pasta With Grilled Chicken, Tomato, Basil & Mozzarella is my go to dish. It's a huge plate of deliciousness - whether you're sober or drunk! If only I could make this dish myself...  Sorry, Chris Brown. This girl is loyal! ;)",

My wife had a breakfast entree. The usual eggs, hash browns and bacon. Cant mess that up.   We noticed that some people were going to a buffet inside the restaurant. We overheard when they sat the table next to us that they had that. The lady never mentioned that to us however. I think they need to be better about that. Also , the front hostess wasn't the friendliest. She barely looked at us and seemed like she hated her job. Thats not so great for the first person you encounter when you walk into the place. Middle aged lady with her hair tied back. Didn't get her name, but she was working lunch this past Saturday.   Other than that, this place is good.

This trip we ate here 3 times because we found that the restaurant really lives up to its guidelines of fresh ingredients, extensive menu, and good prices.  The restaurant is very large, seats up to 728 people, but is divided into 3 areas: street cafe, bar area and main dining room, and the main dining room has a high ceiling, but is well designed so not truly \"noisy\". They do designate non-smoking areas, which seems to help. It is owned and run by the Cheesecake Factory, but is elegant in its design. Although I have not been to the Cheesecake Factory, it is my understanding that the menu is rather different than that of the Factory.  It is located on the same floor as the casino in the Venetian and is open 24/7. There is a breakfast menu, lunch dinner menu, and late night menu, the latter which, for obvious reasons, is smaller than the main menu, but still quite good.  The portions are substantial, so we were able to order one salad and one entree and split them and feel adequately fed. The ingredients were extremely fresh and flavors were understated.  I consider this restaurant a True gem of a find in Las Vegas.",

This rating is completely based off of my experience as a part of a very large group here; I have not visited and ordered on my own. I do know this place is owned by the same company as the Cheesecake Factory, and the menu is very similar. In general I'm a cheesecake factory fan, although I think the menu is too large.

I was expecting it to be a lot busier.  We were a party of 6, 4 adults and 2 kids.  The bread basket was good, I think I prefer it to CF.  A rustic sourdough, although the butter wasn't softened.  They also carry coke products   I don't eat beef and my most favorite turkey burger is the turkey burger from the Cheesecake Factory.  So, I ordered it here, and it didn't disappoint.  The bread they serve it on isn't really conducive to the burger( its long and rustic), so I just removed it and enjoyed the burger.  Very moist, tasty turkey burger.  Served with fries and not that many of them too.   We had lettuce wraps and ceviche as an appetizer.  I didn't taste the latter, but the lettuce wraps are similar to the wraps at PF Changs.  Not the same lettuce wraps as CF.   My friend had the kobe meatballs and she raved about it.  Her son had a filet mignon and not one morsel was left on the plate.  Another son had a kids cheese pizza.  Not much to say about that.  Friends husband had the caramel chicken and he seemed to enjoy it.  They liked their alcoholic drinks.   Service was pleasant and not too overbearing.  A good solid choice for a hotel, especially if you don't want to taxi it someplace else.",

Speaking of the dining room, it is one of the nicer ones I've seen because of all the marble, polished stone and metal they use in the design.  Service is generally good.

But for me, after 12-15 hour days on my feet running around the event floor, this is my go to dinner spot. It's located not far from the guest room elevators (less walking!) they have a nice bar it's easy to tuck into a corner and enjoy a drink, and they have an excellent take out menu so I can hobble back upstairs and relax in my suite.   My favorite items here are the chicken lettuce wraps, and the beet and goat cheese salad. The menu is overwhelming in options-pizzas, pastas, burgers, breakfast, and can't forget the dessert. While I wish my job hours and energy level allowed me to venture out for some of those famous Vegas restaurants, I am always happy to get fast service, reliable food, and retreat to my room to enjoy.",

And pretty much yea. nothing spectacular on the menu, but they do have everything. pasta, pizza, asian-ish noodles, etcetc. Given that I'm not a huge Cheesecake fan...yea.  I ordered the Crispy Thai Shrimp and Chicken Spring Rolls. For some reason I thought it would be spring rolls..with crispy shrimp inside..but no...it was an egg roll. with mushy shrimp and chicken inside. I liked the sweet sauce, and how it came with lettuce and carrots. But other than that...pretty pricey for some egg rolls...  My friend got the Crispy Sesame Tofu. She didn't like it. I tasted it and didnt really like it either. The sauce was...very strange. Had a tangy citrus-y taste, but also a little wasabi-ish spiciness...all with the look and consistency and sweetness of teriyaki sauce.  Zen noodle = pho.   Pizza: looked ok. I think pastas might be the safest bet...those in my party who got your standard pasta were pretty happy.    Willing to give this place another try though! chicken and waffles sound amazing!!",

    "text": "So we went to the Grand Luxe Cafe here in the Palazzo hotel for breakfast. The food and everything was great! We had the beignets which is always spot on and so delicious!^^ I think that was the best point out of this experience. However our waitress, Brendida T(?), she did not make this experience as great. The service was the only problem. She seemed mad or irritated. While she was taking our order (party of 6) and when my mom would ask questions about the menu (since we never had breakfast here before), she was very rude and cutting my mom off when she was talking and she took the menu away from me when I was looking at it still and she rudely pointed for the menu next to my sister for me to hand to her! Later when my mom asked for a couple of cups of coffee for my grandmothers and aunt, she yelled at my mom when asking if we wanted cream when my mom couldn't hear (accident)! This was the (first) worst experience...",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I wanted to go somewhere nice for dinner on the strip without spending a few 100 dollars.   We had never been to the Palazzo so we decided to check it out. When we noticed they had a Grand Lux, we were pretty excited.  Small tangent: We both work at the Cheesecake Factory and hear about the Grand Lux all the time but this was our first chance to check it out.   Although similar to CCF, there were some key differences that we appreciated. Being a server and bartender, we tend to be more aware/sympathetic when we dine out.  On this occasion, we had nothing to comment on except for how amazing the service really was. Our server, Nick, made us feel comfortable the entire time, made suggestions, and notified us of all the specials.   Back to the experience:  We were seated promptly to a nice quite booth in the back. Nick greeted us right away but allowed us a little more time after telling about the specials and baked desserts.  I decided to have the Clemetine Crush and my boyfriend had the Blood Orange Mojito. Both were delicious but we were excited that the Mojito had a floater of our fave rum, Sailor Jerry.   For an appetizer we decided to try the Asian nachos which we thought sounded original and interesting. And they did not disappoint! They were full of flavor with the right mix of spicy and sweet. The peanut sauce was amazing and the wontons were nice and crispy. Definitely a new favorite of mine for sure.  For dinner, we decided to split the Pasta Pomodore with the chicken meatballs. This was also delicious. The bread was warm and fresh.  We were sad that we didn't have room for dessert but it will be something to look forward to next time!!",

And yes it was. The cheese was ooey gooey and the bacon was a great addition to it! I was really shocked by how large it was. It was huge! I had no idea how I was going to finish this and then get into my clubbing clothes without looking bloated. Maybe next time I will just opt for a salad, the portion for that looked pretty generous too. But anyway, the burger will definitely satisfy any hunger or craving you have. The fries were perfectly cooked and seasoned. And I love the sauce that it comes with!",

The ONLY reason this restaurant gets anything above a 1 star is because the food is pretty darn good.  I've had their Korean short rib tacos, tuna ceviche, chicken wraps, various entrees...everything is very good.  Then what's the problem???  THE SERVICE SUCKS.  My most recent stay was the worst.  Stephanie was our waitress.  I honestly think I knew more about their menu than she did.  I asked her what gluten free options there were and she didn't know.  I asked her if she had grilled shrimp, she said I can order fried shrimp and not have them fry it in breading.  (Uh, what?)  I asked if she can make the salmon piccata without the sauce and she said they can just cook a chicken breast with no seasonings and sauce.  (What?  I just asked you about salmon, but you're telling me to eat chicken?)  Then I asked her if I could use the rice noodles in their \"Zen\" noodle dish with a butter, cheese or cream sauce for the kiddo, and she said I could use Spaghettini or Fettuchini instead.  (What?  I'm trying to order gluten-free!)  So needless to say, all we got were french fries for the kiddo.  Yeah...because she didn't know if anything on the menu was gluten free or not, nor could she tell us if the kitchen could make anything gluten free except a season-less, sauce-less chicken breast.  Sounds tasty.  (roll-eyes)  Anyway, when I was ordering food, I pointed to the Korean short rib tacos and said I would like to order the Korean short-rib tacos.  They bring out Mexican chicken tacos.  Um...  Then it takes them forever and a half to get us the right order, despite \"the manager\" putting a rush on it.  \"The manager\" never stopped by to say a word to us.  Then as we are trying to leave, we had finished all our food and we're flagging her down, and it takes her about 15 minutes AFTER we were done eating for her to bring us the check.  Then it takes her another 15 minutes to come back to take payment.  So basically 30 minutes of our lives were wasted for no apparent reason.  Worst waitress ever.  She reminded me of Phoebe from \"Friends.\"  P.S. We overheard her taking the order of the people behind us.  They asked her what sodas they had that were caffine-free.  She said, \"um, Coke Zero? We also have iced tea.\"  Really?  BOTH of her recommendations had caffeine in them.",

After lounging by the pool in the morning (don't know how people spend so much time out there, it gets boring... and sleepy), we were starving for some lunch since we didn't really eat any breakfast. We decided to check this place out.  Decor is immediately recognizable, a bit of an upscale version of Cheesecake. No lines, so we were seated immediately. I was in the breakfast/brunch mood, so I opted for the corned beef hash while my wife had the seafood salad. When the food arrived, my eyes widened. I was happy that the large prices corresponded with large portions.  I had requested that my hash browns and corned beef to be extra crispy, and it didn't disappoint. The corned beef was plentiful, in toothsome but tender chunks that complimented the fluffy scrambled eggs. The crispy texture of the hash browns was a nice contrast. All I needed was a few dashes of ketchup and I was good. I wiped the plate clean.  I had a few bites of my wife's seafood salad and it was pretty good. Everything is nicely lined up and cut up into uniform pieces. There was a good amount of seafood chunks. Service was prompt and easy going, and we were in and out of there after finishing our food. I would definitely return if I'm in the area and in the mood for some American comfort food with an upscale twist. 3.5 stars.",

We wanted a convenient and relatively inexpensive meal before our red eye flight home.  We had a wonderful, attentive, friendly waiter.     My husband and I each order the cream of chicken soup and a salad - the wedge for me, which is considered a \"small\" salad though it is literally half of a head of lettuce, and my husband had the roasted beet salad.  Everything was very good and came out quickly.    The waiter had alerted us to their made-to-order desserts when we first arrived, so we order the beignets.  The were amazing!  The came out super hot with three dipping sauces - raspberry, chocolate, and creme anglaise (maybe with bourbon in it?).  There were so many beignets!  I ended up over eating because they were so good I just couldn't help myself.  The server (also friendly) who delivered our dessert recommended mixing the sauces and boy was she right - the raspberry and chocolate together were to die for.    This was also the only time on our entire trip that a manger stopped by our table to see how things were.  We made sure to tell him what a wonderful job our waiter had done and how happy we were after having bad service at so many \"fine dining\" restaurants previously in the week.  He was also very nice.   The entire meal (with drinks) ended up being $70 (with an almost 30% tip), money well spent!",

So we ordered wine and ended up getting a vegetable flat bread for some late night munchies.  It was yummy.  Of course at the end of the night you can't NOT order some cheesecake.  :)",

The ambiance is nice- not fancy, but not casual, but somewhere in the middle, the service is good and the food is pretty good, as well. They have a varied menu with all kinds of dishes including pastas, salads, sandwiches, omelets and some \"world\" dishes like jambalayas, enchiladas and stir-fries. It's a pretty straightforward, simple menu and the prices are all very reasonable. I would recommend the Grand Lux for breakfast or for lunch, but for dinner you may want to go somewhere else.",

The buffalo chicken rolls were great as an appetizer. I had the carmel chicken and my wife had greek salad. As you probably know CF portions are HUGE and this place was just the same. We sat on the \"patio\" which is really just out in the middle of the Venetian. It's crazy and very loud, but what do you expect in Vegas.",

Great for big groups, they'll get you in & out real quick so you can get back to losing your money in the casino!",

The food is amazing, the staff is friendly and attentive, and the location in the Palazzo can't be beat.  We ordered the Sunday Night Pasta and the Jambalaya. The pasta sounded like a strange combination (braised beef and pasta), but it was amazing and the Jambalaya was the best I've ever tasted. The portion sizes are enormous so you definitely wont leave hungry, and for the price (about $15/person), you can't find a much better place to eat on the strip.  The wait staff is extra friendly and always seem to come by at just the right times so you never really have to wait long for refills or anything like that. Definitely recommended, wish they would open one up near where I live so I wouldn't have to go to Vegas to eat here.",

    "text": "I was in the Palazzo and figured I'd stop by the newest Grand Lux for a lunch before skipping town. I ordered the Burger Max and replaced the fries with sweet potato. The service was a little below average but the food was great. The Burger Max is a big burger (10 oz?) with bacon, cheddar cheese, and short ribs. They cooked the burger perfectly, which is nice because most places won't do a medium-rare burger despite it being a scientifically proven fact that medium-rare is the only way to consume a burger for maximum taste. The burger was amazing. I'd easily put it in my top 10 burgers of all-time. And even though the thing will probably cost me several days of my life, I don't regret eating it at all and would do it many times over again. The sweet potato mash was pretty tasty as well (although I had actually ordered sweet potato FRIES). Food was a 5. Service was a 3. Overall 4.",

Service was quick, cheerful and I got 15 minutes of peace, waiting on my soup and salad. Food is always good at Grand Lux (my personal favorite is just off the Magnificent Mile in Chicago). Prices are very reasonable - normal entree pricing ranging from 10 to 25+. Skip the \"name\" joints, go to Grand Lux for good food that's not going to break the budget",

I've been to other more \"big name\" resturants and the food and service didnt come close to this place.   I do Agree with the other osters, The mashed potatoes spring rolls are AWESOME!! we had them the first night there after a long flight and painful shuttle ride.  The and teh calamari/vegtables.  It was all soo good and enought to share.  Breakfast was also great. 2Eggs, bacon, toast and hasbrowns for 9.99! very good and too much to finish. I aslo went there for my bday dinner with my 8 friends and had a great time, our waiter(tim) was so sweet and funny.  the birthday decorations they did on my dessert was really nice and the recommendations he gave were right on. LOVED the Snitzel!   And its a plust that they are open late, or 24 hours right next door.",
