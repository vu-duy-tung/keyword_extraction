    "text": "NOBU.  This 5 star Yelp rating is really a 6 star experience.  Okay, I'm a self admitted sushi snob.  I can't help it.  No matter where I go it always comes back to Nobu--Bahamas, New York, Malibu, Las Vegas...  Every single location I've been to has provided a first-class sushi experience.  The Las Vegas folks were especially nice - particularly since I was playing those Wheel of Fortune machines again and much to my husband's dismay we missed our reservation and they gave our table away.  As soon as we arrived, they moved us to the top of the list for the sushi bar - on one of their busiest nights.  Thank you Nobu Las Vegas team.  PROS: - Incredible selection of sushi, dinners, etc. - A great place to meet up at the sushi bar or to have the full first class dinner experience - The best fresh fish, most unique combinations (my fav - yellow tail sashimi with japlapeno...  yum, I have dreams about this)  CONS: - Pricey - Maybe a bit pretentious (according to my husband), but I disagree",

    "text": "So I've been here a half dozen times in the past 6 months for birthdays and business dinners. For those that know how & what to order this is honestly the best Japanese in Las Vegas. When I read the low star reviews it's obvious the ordering went awry, so I'm going to use this review as a class in what to get at Nobu 101:  First My DONT'S: *Do NOT come here with a low budget in mind . You will pay over $100 pp  if you want a satisfying amazing meal. I've come in here and tried to do it \"cheap\" and walked away angry and disappointed. Wait to dine here until you have the budget to do so properly.  *Do not order off the main menu . It's boring. The food isn't that great. Steak is blah. Tempura is blah. Seriously avoid avoid avoid. *Don't order sushi rolls.. this should go without saying!!!  *Don't blindly get the chef's omakase. You'll likely end up disappointed. *Don't order the shit you get at your normal sushi place and compare it. Order EXOTIC cool things you can't get at home.  Now for what to do!: *Peruse the \"special\" menu and also talk to the waiter about other goodies they might have hiding in the back. Literally all my great meals here have been 100% OFF the main menu. The off the menu items are by far the best *Be open minded and try the interesting off the wall stuff. It will really blow you away. I've found the waiters to be really down to earth and cool here.. use them as a resource. Tell them what you like/don't like and ask for recommendations !   Lastly, I'll leave you with my favorites. Most are off the menu. Most are seasonal. Yes, it's a grab bag what they'll have when you decide to dine here but honestly I've never been disappointed when ordering this way !   Cold: *Barracuda. OMG. Best sashimi I've had in my life. Who knew! *Tazmanian Ocean Trout. My next favorite. Basically like a mild buttery salmon.  *Japanese snapper with pineapples *Kampachi. I do prefer this prepared the yellow tail jalapeno way instead of the yellow tail. Once you've had wild yellow tail it's hard to order the normal one ever again !   Hot: *Black miso cod lettuce wraps... WITH FOIE GRAS. Insanely good. *The huge fried fish in that amazing buttery sauce. Definitely not for the dieters or light eaters. Get 1 of these if you have a huge group. It's big and heavy *Quail stuffed with pork belly (as amazing as it sounds!)  Cliffsnotes: Avoid ordering from the main menu. It's boring, uninspired and won't excite you. Be brave and bold when ordering, don't come with a limited budget. Enjoy!",

Everything here is overpriced including the cocktails.  They will build you a \"custom\" menu built on your price point which can be a double sided sword.  When asked this question by your server, it seems like there is no right answer and whatever you answer, you may potentially sound like a cheap ass, ha!  The food is always amazing, the hostess's are always nice but once you are seated, it can be a shot in the dark.  Kobe beef is sold by the ounce and melts in your mouth.  Fish is fresh.  You can't go wrong on the menu.",

It's not that the quality is bad, but for the money you spend you simply expect more.  For starters we had the new style salmon sashimi and the yellowtail jalapeno sashimi. Both were very good. However, the rolls we ordered afterwards left a lot to be desired.   The ambience could also be a lot better. The design reminded me more of a Japanese ramen kitchen.",

    "text": "For some reason no matter what city, if there is a Nobu I end up going to it. (tough life) There is some special draw about the food and the execution that get friends or coworkers to want to eat at a Nobu. The atmosphere is always special, encouraging a good conversation, people watching and banter with the staff.  The food used to be extremely special when it first started in LA. But as the years have past other restaurants have caught up and copied Nobu's menu.  The food in Vegas is still top notch, with fresh fish, inventive sauces that accentuate the food and great sake.  The price is very expensive for what you get but at the end of the night it is about the whole experience.  My favorite dishes are: toro tartare, hamachi sashimi with jalapenos, and the fried rock shrimp with cream sauce.  Inside scoop: do not get the free for all omakase where the waiter pretends to customize the menu for you.  This is not like the places in Tokyo where the chef stares deep into your soul and magically delivers the menu of a lifetime.  Instead here they are just trying to run up the tab.",

    "text": "Amazing black cod. Amazing. So, so good. The new style tataki is my second favorite. If you're considering yellowtail, do the sashimi even of you're tired of ponzu and jalapeno. The yellowtail roll isn't as good. I mean, it's great, but I think the sashimi plate is a better deal with more flavor. Like Blair B. said, get the unique plates here.  As a side note, Nobu participated in the Taste of the Nation, Las Vegas, which is a fundraiser to end childhood hunger in Nevada. Nobu cares about our community. I really appreciate that!  Service at Nobu is really out of this world.  Nobu's bento box is my favorite dessert of all time, so much so that I replicate it at home with success--flour-less chocolate cake with green tea ice cream and hot fudge. Lord have mercy I am in heaven!  If you have the money, spend it on Nobu.",

    "text": "I've eaten at 4 other of their restaurants and have to admit, their food and service is very consistent.  We showed up with 11 people for an 8 person reservation and were accommodated immediately.  Drinks were brought out fast, as were a fee of the appetizers.  Once we all ordered our dinners though, thinks went a little downhill.  I had two full plates of sushi in front of me for almost 10 minutes before anyone else got what they ordered.  The delivery of food was so sporadic, we basically just took turns watching each other eat.  -1 point for the most \"memorable\" part of the dinner; the cheap, takeout quality, give-your-tongue-splinters, chopsticks!  How do you cheap out on these disposable splinters of firewood?  Such a cheap item to upgrade, instead it totally ruined the dinner for the table...it was like going to a good steak house and being given a plastic knife to cut your filet.  Two at the table were somehow offered dessert while the rest of us never even saw the menu or heard the offerings, -1 again for lack of service.  Not much of a social scene for what I was expecting at the Hard Rock, but still one of the better options in Vegas for sushi.   About half the price of Massa, but you sacrifice the service a little bit.  Still better than the other strip options as far as quality of food goes though.",

After my recent visit I realized I have to give proper respect and yelp my love for them.  Here are some of my favorites:  Toro Tartare with Caviar - This dish makes me want to commit a felony.  If I were on death row it would be my last meal, I would definitely die happy.  As one of my favorite sayings on Howard Stern perfectly stated, this dish will make you 'go ahead and release the poison'.  Yellowtail with Jalapenos - Always fresh and delicious!  I believe that all other sushi restaurants have tried to duplicate this dish but can never quite get the perfect flavor.   Sashimi Salad - BAM!  The dressing is off the chain, the tuna beyond fresh.    Kobe Beef Toban Yaki - I'm not a religious person by any means but I'm certain the heeled hands of Jesus came down and prepared this dish himself with the blessing of his father.  Of course you cannot go there without consuming a couple of their saketini's.  Why can't any other bar/restaurant get their saketini's to be this delicious??  They are alone worth a visit there.",

    "text": "I was skeptical, but Nobu delivered. I just finished dinner with a friend of mine and I had to write a review before I forgot the details. Let's just get to the chase.  My friend and I walked in and I asked our server what the best three dishes were. He then recommend these three. I felt like a stuck up food critic requesting the chef hit me with his best shot. But I often do this for restaurants that I've never been to. After dinner, I find myself recommending the same. Here's the pro and cons:  1) Toro Carpaccio- Okay, $70 for six pieces of fish can be a little on the steep side, but hey, I had to know what it was about. Now I know and here's the scoop. The toro is incredibly delicious. It is amazingly tender, quite possibly the most tender toro I've ever had. The fish alone is a star, but the flavor profile that the chefs prepare is pretty impressive too. Capers, truffle shavings, truffle oil and soy dressing over greens really hit the mark. I will say that there was a little too much soy sauce for my taste (That's right, I'm Chinese and I'm saying it). I would request they served the sauce on the side, but fear they will substitute excess soy sauce with hate.  2)Yellowtail Jalapeno- This was almost my favorite dish of the night had it not been for the sheer flavor of the toro. The Yellowtail is served as one would expect from an expensive sushi restaurant: fresh, flavorful, tender and seasoned according. The jalapeno slice was perfect- excellent spice without burning my mouth. I would actually recommend this as a first dish.   3) Black Cod Miso- I thought this was a little overrated by the other reviews. Cooked to near perfection, the Cod was warm inside but seared and slightly crispy outside. The miso glaze wasn't much to look at. For me, it resembled gravy. I've seen others' pictures and theirs looks much nicer. Nevertheless, the dish was great. I actually prefer Black Cod cooked slightly medium, but cooked to the core with awesome texture. Sweet Miso sauce finished off the dish and made it very enjoyable.   4)Sea Urchin sashimi or sushi!!! Just order it.   My friend and I were pretty hungry and ordered other dishes but I must say that they didn't exactly knock me off my feet. Overall, many of the other dishes were very good, but just not amazing. Here's the list:  -Salmon skin hand roll- thin slices of salmon skin with gobo, rice and seasoning. Nice to have a place serve quality over quantity when it comes to the salmon skin.  -Baracuda Dry Miso- $40 for six slices of barracuda. Very interesting texture as I haven't had barracuda before. The lemon/citrus sauce was a bit too much. Again, I see this as how the chef intends the dish to be enjoyed, so I simply eat and keep my comments to myself.   Live Scallop- again, great cut of scallops, but nothing special to write home about. It was nice that it was served with muscle in ponzu sauce.   New Style Oyster- Four pieces of Kumamoto Oysters served ready to enjoy. So you have to eat it the way they prepare the seasoning.  Crispy rice w/ Big Eye Tuna- For lack of a better term, it's Japanese tatter tots. Square rice cubes deep fried served with essentially tuna poke. Well prepared, tasty, but nothing special.   All in all, it was a great experience. My general assessment is that Nobu serves dishes with strong flavor profiles. Not exactly my cup of tea. Maybe I'm a fond believer that less is more and that the fish should speak for itself. However, I can appreciate the fact that a chef's dish is his own art. So I eat with an open mind and share my interpretation. Hope this helps.",

It took a total of 5 minutes to register an account, reserve a table and get a confirmation email (which is useful in Vegas) Too many times you will go to a restaurant and you'll get the classic line \"SORRY we don't have your reservation\" .. Will never happen with Nobu!   We came early so we started with Veuve Clicquot champagne cocktails at the bar (Yummy!)  After being quickly seated at our perfect table, we started our dinner off with the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno  and a Chilled Bamboo (the large size) of their ONIGOROSHI \"DEVIL KILLER\" Sake.    During our time there we followed that up with lobster tacos/tuna tacos, a small order of their DELICIOUS Rock Shrimp Tempura with a Creamy Spicy Sauce, a variety of sashimi/sushi and a another *blush* Bamboo of their Devil Killer!  I've been a foodie since as long as I can remember. I worked in every position in the restaurant business from Busgirl to GM and I can honestly say that this is the best restaurant I've ever been in. Their famnily style service was classy and refined--but still fun and trendy!   The waiters gave us the perfect amount of attention, They bus their tables quickly without disturbing our conversation. Ours even gave us honest suggestions of what the best thing on the menu that day.  I wish I can do this every Friday, but it was my birthday weekend and we just splurged. The bill was about $430 with tip but worth every penny!!!",

The service was good to great, but you would expect that from a restaurant of this price, but what's the deal with all the caucasian waiters who can't even pronounce omakase?! (For the record, it's oh-ma-ka-say, not oma-case)  The atmosphere was pretty lacking. It was dark, loud, and looked almost like someone sort of gave up on the decoration. It was just so-so nice and didn't really give off any particular vibe. And I've never been to any kind of restaurant other than a hole-in-the-wall where they give you the bill on a freaking round white plate. Then after you give them a credit card, they bring back the receipt and a pen. Yes, just the receipt and a pen. No plate, no folio, nothing. They just put the receipt on the tabel with the pen. Does that scream 4-star restaurant to you?  When trying out new sushi restaurants, we always like to order some of the basics, to get a foundation to compare against other places. We ordered the sushi and sashimi plates. Both had decent to very good fish (but not *great*) except for two big disappointments: the tuna was really mediocre, and hello! take it easy on the wasabi, chef! Sushi chefs that use too much wasabi are either trying to cover up not-so-fresh fish, or they're just not really good at making sushi. The fish seemed pretty fresh, so I don't think they were trying to cover anything up, which leaves......  Maybe we should've had lower expectations when we came in, or maybe Nobu is only good with the fancier dishes. But for the prices they charge for \"regular\" sushi and sashimi, it's just not worth it.  The service gets a 4. The decor/vibe gets a 2.5, and  if the prices were maybe 30-40% lower, I could easily have given them 3 or maybe even 4 stars. But for what you get, I'd give them a 2.5. But since yelp doesn't let you give half stars, I'd round off this overpriced place to a 2.",

    "text": "So -- since her younger sister spent her birthday in London . . . actually, we spent my wife's birthday in Paris, but her birthday fell while we were still out of the country -- when we asked what she wanted to for her birthday, she quite matter-of-factly replied, \"Vegas, baby!\"  OK, so we're in Las Vegas again for our daughter's 12th birthday.  It's me, my wife, and our two girls.  These are girls whose preferred snack is sushi.  These are kids who grew up eating at places like Chez Panisse, Lalime's -- kids who the people at the Cheese Board know not only by sight but are on a first-name basis with.  These are Berkeley kids.  We go to Nobu.  We have reservations for a 9:00 show, so we make 6:00 pm dnner reservations.  If they had their way, they would have had us out of there by 6:15!  There were actually six of us for dinner, lined up with dozens of other people waiting for the front door to be unlocked promptly at 6:00.  We inched inside as part of the reservation conga, only to be shunted aside while they seated others who were in line behind us.  What?  Our table not ready?  THE PLACE WAS EMPTY UNTIL THEY LET US IN!  It's not like they had to wait for someone to leave before they could seat us.  We listened to the waiter's suggestions in terms of how he thought (the restaurant thought?) we should proceed through the menu.  The three adults order sake; the three kids ordered whatever it was that they ordered; and we all ordered food.  O.K., I do NOT believe that a place with the reputation of Nobu makes their sushi in advance.  I DO believe their sushi is made-to-order.  Honest, I do.  But the sushi, the soup, the soba, the hot plates -- it all came at warp speed, and plates were whisked away before I finished swallowing the last bite!  Instead of a relaxed meal where we could talk, drink, and savor some extraordinary dishes, we were given our check (not cheap) and practically rushed out the door!  I'm had more relaxing meals at In-n-Out!  In the drive-up lane.  Nobu?  No thank you.",

    "text": "Nobu Vegas, much like other Vegas Strip satellite restaurants = meh.  I can't give it 2 stars, because the food is too good for that. Not great, like a real Nobu, but good. When you factor in the cost (2 of us spent over $400), it comes nowhere near what its name would imply.  DECOR The decor is trying too hard, pulling in all directions. There are individually cool elements, like the river rock wall, or the exploded hashi ceiling. But there are at least 5 different themes like this all smashed together. Complete contrast to japanese design principles of linear minimalism. Must be the Vegas factor.  FOOD Started out pretty good, with a Toro-Caviar dish. Great mix of flavors and a unique sauce. Everything after that, including the sushi, was was just good. A beef tenderloin dish came out steaming hot, but with little flavor and essentially raw asparagus and enoki still clumped together on top, like it just got unwrapped from the plastic pkg. I've eaten better in strip mall Japanese (many of these are surprisingly good!). I'm not a Japanese food expert/snob, but I've lived in Japan, worked in Japanese restaurants and cook a lot of Japanese dishes at home. Then again, so do millions of Japanese people, and they're not all snobs or experts. But I know how to compare Japanese-inspired food experiences. I also realize there is a fusion element going on at Nobu, but that is done much better at places like Sea Saw in Scottsdale. Overall = disappointing.  OTHER FACTORS I'M NOT COUNTING IN MY EVALUATION (but worth noting for lols)  THOR Our waiter was absolutely unintelligible. We nicknamed him Thor. He looked like a Norwegian model from a 1976 Playgirl. Very nice guy, but we just pretended to understand what he said. Every time he walked away, we both said: \"You catch any of that??? Me neither!\" No complaints on the service, just glad the menu was available to point at.  BLIND DATE VEGAS The table next to us was fookin hilarious. It was the most awkward blind date I've ever witnessed, not on TV. We kept looking around for cameras, because we swore this was a setup for a show. It is a crime that this was not captured on video. This middle-aged blowhard had this girl,  who had to be 20 years younger (NTTAWWT), held captive while he ranted about his boat and his travels and his companies (plural!) that he coudln't talk about because of his work with the NSA. He'd have to kill the whole restaurant if he told us. And he WAS talking to the whole restaurant. He insisted on feeding her from his chopsticks, for every bite. He kept asking for her review of the date, during the date. EPIC DEFEAT. He let us all know that he had to ask the universe for the right person to meet. The girl seemed to politely disagree with the universe. Bless her heart. She was a trooper.  Also, his chopstick skills were so good because he was \"raised in Japan\", but when she wanted him to speak Japanese, somehow that got by his experience of being raised there.  so...  Nobu, meh.  Thor, enjoy Valhalla.  Blind Date, see ya on the uncensored DVD.",

The California roll was pre made and they used imitation crab in the roll. The selection of sushis given were very low grade -maguro, white fish and salmon. We were so hungry that we ordered eight more pieces of individual sushis. Our meal was supposed to be paid for.... but because we ordered more sushis- our bill was $75 ( in addition to the $99 that we paid already).",

All very very good, especially the Bass and Trout.   Sushi: Fish was the freshest around.  However, I was very disappointed with the lack of creativity.  I asked my Sushi Chef for anything unique that they do with their sushi.  Got a blank stare.  I'm used to the unrelated and not-so-famous Nobu's in Solana Beach, CA where creativity is more common than not, and what a difference it makes.    Service was incredible.  It felt as if they are standing behind you waiting for your every need.  I suppose you have to order off the specials if you want something creative (non-sushi), but you'll be paying a premium $30 to $75+ per plate.  Should be a 4 to 4.5 star, but since I had high expectations that weren't met, I'm docking my rating by a point.",

I could barely hear the waitress with all her training explain the food to me. (and since you did not provide a printed menu for the Chef's Tasting Menu) - I had no clue what some of the things I was eating even were.  You gave me disposable chopsticks...and not the nice kind... FOR F's SAKE NOBU, ARE YOU JOKING? $350+ Dinner?  Pathetic.

I cannot accurately describe one thing I ate that night.  I am a Foodie.  The fact that I cannot recall one menu item can only mean one thing; Nobu, you aren't worth your salt.  I will never go back.  I will not encourage others to fritter a night away in Vegas that would be better spent in a fine dining establishment that is not having an identity crisis.  You guys have issues, and I am shocked at your overall rating.  Clearly being \"cool\" (and I say this with cheek) is enough to keep you in business in Las Vegas, (and apparently in LA).

    "text": "Matsuhisa Nobu, I salute you! Your food is divine. I am jealous of your restaurant's decor. I envy your river stone wall. I wish I was a celebrity so I wouldn't have to wait so damn long to eat in your wickedly awesome dining establishment! I simultaneously loathe and love you...in a platonic sort of way, of course...  Nobu (in the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino) is one of my all-time favorite restaurants. I've also been to Matsuhisa's in Los Angeles, but there's nothing like the Nobu experience. It's Vegas baby!!  Anyway, I've found that it's so much easier to make reservations at Nobu if you're actually staying in the hotel (which is awesome, by the way). One of my college roommates' sisters used to work there and hooked me up with a discounted suite on two occasions...SCORE! It also doesn't help if you're pretty slick with the pass-the-twenty-as-you-shake-the-host/hostess'-hand-in-order-to-get-a-table-faster bit. Never worked for me...kept dropping the money...  Back to the food: pricey? Abso-friggin'-lutely! Take one look at the place. Nice furniture, kitschy bamboo sake bottles and cups, rice paper wall paneling, indoor bamboo plants, wall inlaid with black river stones, huge sushi bar, and you mustn't forget about the main ingredient: location, location, location. The Hard Rock is practically a sure-fire way to keep this place packed with gorgeous-looking people. They need some way to pay the rent, right?  But is the food tasty? Hells to the yeah, it is! Every single dish I've ever had here has been delicious...even the ones that I'm usually not too keen on were better than other places (mirugai for example: here = tasty; other sushi places = like chewing on a salted piece of bicycle tire). The sea bass is prepared very well (nice and moist, flaky too), the rock shrimp is fried to perfection, the sashimi is beautifully presented, and the tataki is to die for...*sigh* if only I could be there right now... Their desserts are just as good as their appetizers and entrees. The last time I was there they had a passion fruit sorbet that could knock you out with its incredible flavor (oooh...my mouth's watering just thinking about it...and now I've drooled on my keyboard...how embarrassing...).  As I mentioned before, this place can get pricey. But, if you have the funds and the stomach for it, you have to go with the omakase (chef's choice). Tip: let your server know what you're partial to and what doesn't exactly float your boat in the food department (I'm not a big fan of uni (sea urchin), so I let 'em know that...thanks Nobu!). I believe there are different levels to the omakase dinner, too...at least there was the last time I visited. But, if omakase's not the thing for you, go a la carte...that way you can try a variety of Nobu's offerings. It's all up to you.  Since Nobu's in a Vegas hot-spot, be prepared for celebrity sightings as well. The first time I ate there, my wife and I were seated next to a group of porn stars (they had to be with their excessively tight and skimpy clothing, the gratuitous cleavage (both male and female), the over-tanned, near-leather quality to their skin, and (of course) the cowboy hats!) C'mon! Who wears a cowboy hat in a Japanese restaurant while wearing practically nothing?! Porn stars! That's who! I also walked past ex-San Francisco 49er quarterback Jeff Garcia, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Tony Gonzalez, Enrique Iglesias, and Enrique Iglesias' mole (pre-divorce, that is).  Every visit to Nobu is like dinner and a show! I think that alone gives me my money's worth.",

    "text": "In April, we went to Vegas and stayed at the Hard Rock.  I love that place.  That douchebag Simon has a restaurant there, right across the hall from Nobu.  We looked inside the newest entry into the highly competitive arena that is your mother's meatloaf and a chocolate shake for $35, and it reminded me of my elementary school cafeteria.  We were looking over the menu outside the door, which of course was a joke and not the least bit original, at which point the following conversation occurred:  Me:  Jesus what a joke. Wife:  Yeah, it looks pretty lame. Me:  I mean, really.  What a stupid ass restaurant. Wife:  Yeah...  Well, Jon Bon Jovi likes it. Me:  Yeah, well, Jon Bon Jovi is an asshole. Wife:  (now in a hushed tone):  I mean, he just walked out the door and right by us.... Me:  Oh shit.   Fortunately, it would seem that he was out of earshot by that point.  More fortunately, it appears he left Simon in favor of heading over to Nobu.  Good call, that.   We did Nobu twice during our stay.  It was fantastic.  We did mostly just sushi, which was uniformly superior.  However, it is also supremely expensive, and it does have some of the trappings of a touristy restaurant as opposed to a True sushi bar; most notably the fact that it is not necessarily understood that an \"order\" of  \"sushi\" means two pieces.  This can be disconcerting when you get the bill and discover that the toro, which is unbelievably and deliciously oily to the point that it seems suspended between solid and liquid states, cost you $15 PER PIECE.  Not per order, PER PIECE.    I have NEVER had an order of sushi that expensive, and in my mind, no sushi is worth that price.  And I have been to the now relocated-to-New-York Ginza Sushi-Ko in Beverly Hills (afka the most expensive restaurant in LA).  There, their equally top-notch toro was a mere $15 per ORDER, a la carte.  In our second visit, we wised up and didn't order the especially pricey items and still had a terrific experience.  I have no complaints about the place, other than the price.  The chefs were very attentive, accommodating, and friendly.  The waitresses were a little hard to flag down at time, however.  Nobu LV is at least as good as its counterpart in New York, as well as Matsuhisa in LA, and I believe better than Nobu Malibu, all of which I highly recommend.  I'd give it 5 stars if the service were a little better and the prices more reasonable.",

We are in Vegas, I know, but when you're willing to pay for a nice meal, I expect a little more tact on behalf of the servers.  Our waiter was also very quick to tell us how he thought we should move through the menu, all the while, mispronouncing common Japanese dishes.  We tried a number of different dishes and rolls from the blue fin toro to spicy scallops, freshwater eel, albacore, and yellowtail with jalapenos. Everything was... good. Not impressive, certainly not memorable... just good.  The interior of this location was bland. One of my co-workers mentioned that the decoration on the walls looked like large ironing boards, which was a fair assessment. The main dining area was too bright for a comfortable dinner, and had us sitting around the kind of small, wood topped table you might find yourself at while having lunch at your favorite sandwich shop.  The banana cake with sour cream ice cream was a high note, although the spoonful of ice cream that they tried to pass off as a scoop made me feel like I was caught in a scene from American Psycho.   For all the noise I heard about Nobu being something special, I left feeling uninspired, and with a reminder to myself why finding those one of a kind, family run Japanese restaurants is such a treat.",

    "text": "It was a hit-and-miss experience at Nobu in Vegas.  Hits: Mixed seafood ceviche, sweet shrimps - new style sashimi, kumamoto oysters with Nobu sauce, Nobu style lobster tacos, Bluefin tuna tartar with caviar, and tiradito scallops.  Misses: Black cod with miso, house special deluxe roll, fried mai with sweet butter sauce.  Personal favorites are Bluefin tuna tartar and sweet shrimps - new  style sashimi. Presentation and tastes of these two plates are superb and I have never had before. You will be craving for more after you finish the tuna tartar, which are sized like your pinky; you will keep sucking the shrimp tails to get the last piece out.  The reason of my miss experience is that we trusted the waiter's recommendations and ordered the cooked food. To be honest, I strongly advise everyone to stay away from the cook food. If you want to be full, go across the street and get a burger after. This place is pricey and you definitely like to spend your money wisely on the right stuff.  P.S. I have not had the opportunity to have hamachi jalapeno and cannot offer any comment. However, I know a place in San Francisco offers a very similar dish and it was quite good, if not great.",

Nigiri is sold as 1 piece per order so you can look at it as if you ordered a 10 piece omakase for $100...it doesn't seem so bad. Also, if I remember correctly, fresh wasabi would be an extra $7. And if you drink a good amount...it will probably average you about $75-150 on top of your food bill. All in all...it's good and I recommend if you have the moola for it!  Oh yes...sushi bar all day everyday.  Also been to Nobu Waikiki and LA but this ones my fav.",

    "text": "I was in town for my daughter's 21st birthday celebration. I have eaten at Nobu at the Hard Rock hotel in San Diego and it was amazing. I'm from So Cal, so logically, I want to eat at one of my favorite places when I'm visiting in Las Vegas. Unfortunately, the experience in Vegas was completely different then SD. My friend and I went down to the sushi bar around 10:00 pm to eat some fresh rolls and my favorite, rock dynamite shrimp. I was amazed that everything came out in less the 5 mins. Afterwards, I felt like I was chewing on sand. My stomach started to hurt and I felt violently ill. My friend ended up with the same symptoms. I called Nobu to tell them about what happened and our \"ill\" experience and no one ever called me back or even acknowledged the issue. I would not recommend this restaurant or location when you are visiting in Vegas.   An update to this review... My friend spent three days in the Desert Springs Hospital due to food poisoning. I tried calling the manager George Lypton as well as going into the restaurant to update him on my friend's condition. I was supposed to be on a plane and return to Cali, instead I had to extend my stay resulting in more hotel fees and airfare loss. I received a very unsympathetic voicemail that George turned the incident over to his insurance. He doesn't know my friend's name, her number, etc. she was taken by ambulance via a 911 call and he couldn't even follow up on her health or mine? DO NOT eat at NOBU unless you want to be hospitalized!",

I am not a fan of seafood unless it's shrimp.   We walked up to the hostess stand and this polite young lady with long hair asked us  if we would like a table or to sit at the sushi bar. That is when I asked if this was just seafood. She said no there is beef and chicken. I was relieved. The decor is very Japanese. Bamboo on the wall, the ceiling had the wood and rice paper feel. Which gave a dim light, made it hard on my eyes to read the menu.   Thank god for Adrienne our server, because I know nothing about sushi and the menu had me lost. She was really nice and helped point out some good food! The chicken skewers with teriyaki were ok. The beef skewers with teriyaki were delicious, the meat was so tender and cooked perfectly. Each order is $13. I ordered a side of white rice $3. The shrimp rolls were amazing crunchy warm goodness and I'm not a sushi person but this is really good. My boyfriend ordered the spicy shrimp and I got to try that it was good, had some veggies in it.   The servings here are tapas bar size. It's good food but expensive as heck.",

We started with Shishito peppers and an amazing tuna sashimi salad, moved on to a squid and vegetable dish/casserole that was out of this world followed by miso blackened cod that was absolutely mouth watering.  Then came some of the best sushi! Yellowtail with scallion roll, yellowtail with jalapeno roll, and shrimp tempura roll. The wine was a lovely Napa Chardonnay.  The ambiance of this restaurant is calming and the service is excellent!  Japanese restaurants are plentiful in this town so an outstanding stand out restaurant in this category means a lot: this restaurant is outstanding and stands on its own! The prices are very reasonable. Not at all overpriced. Highly recommended. I am definitely going back!",

    "text": "I had wanted to try Nobu for some time, having heard many good things about it. When I saw the $99 Groupon plus the 20% off Groupon was offering plus my wife's B'Day to celebrate there, I knew the stars were aligned.  Could it live up to reputation? The food: The Groupon is for a 5 course tasting menu. The meal starts with a pass out of edamame with maldon salt. A very generous portion and an excellent way to start a meal. The first course was yellowtail tuna with jalapeno and cilantro. The tuna was sliced super thin and was in a citrus sauce. It was very tasty and different than yellowtail that I have eaten at my local sushi restaurant. Things got even better after that. The next dish was rock shrimp tempura with a creamy spicy sauce. Wow, was that good! Not like any tempura I have eaten before. Very lightly breaded, cooked so the shrimp were soft but not mushy. And the spicy sauce was easily handled even by my gringo palate. A great dish. And a huge portion. By its size, the dish would have been enough for dinner if it was the only thing served. This was followed by the Alaskan Black Cod with Miso. Another outstanding dish. The fourth course was the sushi; tuna, fluke and salmon with a California roll. This was the weakest part of the menu - only very good. Last course, dessert. I photographed the plate. A beautiful presentation with very tasty treats (and a hand written birthday greeting in chocolate). The food rates 5 stars plus. The service: As soon as we were seated, our server, Albert, came by to greet us, explain the tasting menu, and take our drink orders. Throughout the meal, he, the busboy, and the food runner were very attentive without being overbearing. They made us feel very welcome. Our water glasses were never allowed to go below half full. The table was cleared promptly. The food came out of the kitchen plated beautifully. The service was 5 stars plus. The ambiance: The restaurant is nicely decorated with lots of bamboo. However, the tables for 2 were placed one on top of the other. We were there on a Monday night, so the tables were never more than 1/3 full.  But our table was about 6 inches from the next table, which was 6 inches from the next in a line up of 4 tables. If the restaurant were crowded and there were people at the next table, we would have been eating with strangers. Not my idea of a celebration/romantic meal. At best, 3 stars for ambiance. Value: $80 for dinner of this quality is the deal of the decade. I would do it again in a heartbeat. But I would never go on a weekend night when the table next to me might be occupied (or I would go with a party of 6 or more - the bigger tables were nicely spaced out).",

A lot of things that came out were drenched in sauce ... especially their hamachi sashimi with jalapeno, which was swimming in ponzu sauce. Their sashimi salad had too much dressing on it. Their black cod was buttery and delicious but again, too much sauce on the outside. If you're serving good fish, don't ruin the flavor!!! You have to complement it and bring out the flavor, not kill it. Other dishes were pretty good but the ones that stick out in my mind are the ones where I had to make a scrunched face when eating ... not a good sign.",

Not only was the staff exceptional but the chef catered to my pregnant food restrictions and that really added to the wow factor. We started off with the Shishito peppers and our server explained that good luck falls upon the person who bites into a hot one as most of them are mild in comparison. That was when I knew that this dining experience was different. I dined with my mother in law and fiance and this starter really opened up our conversation; we laughed and joked and felt lucky at the start of our meal and unlike most dinners, hunching over a plate and ignoring each other, we shared a plate and opened up. Next, we had the Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno and my fiance described it as the best sashimi he has ever had, truly melt in your mouth. The chef also prepared bamboo shoots for me done in the style of a sashimi plate with excellent flavor and texture and made me feel included in the experience (my fiance and mother in law ate some of my bamboo shoots too!) Then came the salmon sashimi for them and the fritters with wasabi aioli for me, presentation as beautiful as ever. The taste excelling on every level with crunchy and creamy to tender and rich. The hits kept coming with the mini tacos. These were not your average tacos! Filled with wagyu beef, lobster and king crab, each taco was a two bite masterpiece. A zest of lime over each taco added a bit of zest to the richness of flavor in an amazing way. The rock shrimp tempura came out and dazzled all 3 of us. The shrimp tossed in a creamy, spicy sauce complemented the tempura crunch so well, we considered it addictive. We enjoyed squid pasta and I had never had squid so delicate and delicious. We were taught the story behind this dish and the presentation was truly phenomenal. The beef tenderloin was probably one of my favorites. We each had our own, cooked to the appropriate temperature (a bit more medium well for me, still considering my pregnancy throughout the meal) and again, melt in your mouth flavor. We finished up with the black cod with miso which I can understand now is one of their most famous dishes as the fish was expertly prepared and the miso flavor complemented the richness so well. Lastly my fiance and mother in law indulged in a full plate of sushi in many varieties and the chef sent out vegetable sushi for me so as to feel included again and it was absolutely delicious and thoughtful. Throughout the dinner we enjoyed education on the dishes and conversation amongst each other. It was an incredible experience that ended with the bento box dessert with a cantaloupe sorbet that my fiance and I still rave about today. We can't wait to go back after I have the baby! Thank you so much, Nobu. Thank you, John Laverde for a fantastic dining experience, it was truly magical and unforgettable.",

    "text": "So, in Vegas, and looking for somewhere to eat that isn't named after a TV show chef?!? Or a place where the food is fresh and not all fried? This would be a great place to start-   Had dinner here while in town for a conference at the beginning of the month with some business acquaintances from out of town- all three of us are pretty familiar with Vegas and what it has to offer- in multiple aspects ! We didn't have to wait- big plus! The server was super knowledgeable of the fish served - and of the menu including the pricing.   The other two that I had the pleasure of dining with asked our server to recommend a few choices and he did- we all agreed to allow his expertise guide us in our meal. He ordered a few dishes - they were great - and then we requested just one more and he complied. The texture, flavor and presentation were amazing. I have had sushi all over the country and this will be rated in the top 5. The flavors made my palate go insane !! 5 stars on the food !   So, a total of 5 dishes for the bargain price of over $250 and that wasn't including a tip. Upon review of the receipt. One dish was charged three times for a mere $18/charge - I questioned the server who politely explained that he took the liberty of ordering three orders of so each of us at the table could have two pieces... I'm sure he did. The other three dishes were on average of $60 ish each- hmm.... One would have thought that he would have had the courtesy to pick a variety of dishes price point speaking - not the highest on the menu OR have the courtesy to ask if our group was on a budget or what our price point was verses assuming. Our tip alone paid for his internet bill for the month in addition to half of his cell phone bill.   Out of courtesy- we all reached for our cards (me slightly cringing at what my accounting people were going to say when they saw this horrifically high dinner for three) and one of the other two decided they would take the heat on the cost... Not sure how he are going to explain that one.   Moral of this story is- always order your own food in Vegas unless you have an unlimited budget! Thus the 4 star rating- minus one star for common courtesy and respecting the client/customer.",

    "text": "This is one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas. The first time I ate there last year in June during a conference and thought \"I'd fly here to eat\". Then I went back the second night. I've been back twice since then and it doesn't disappoint. In the 4 times I've eaten there I've sat in the bar 3 times. I like the casual vibe and the waiter remembered me from months ago.   We always start with the shrimp app that is deep fried and covered in deliciousness. I compare it to the bang bang shrimp at Bonefish, but Nobu's is better.   We had the miso cod again, and it was even better this time. We also had several roles. I wasn't blown away with the yellow tail and jalapeno, but found the tempura shrimp very good. We got the scallops in garlic sauce and they are incredible, soft, moist and the flavor is wonderful. I like to let the bar tender make some suggestions but the favorites are absolutely the shrimp, cod and scallops. Next time we will have to try something a bit different!",

    "text": "Nobu @ Hard Rock is a really trendy, cool place to bring a date. Relaxed but upscale Atmosphere and ambiance seems to drive a predominantly hip 30-something crowd.   We got the 7-course omakase. Tasting menu offers a variety of chef selections that give you a broad experience of the menu. Highlights:  various nigiri, black cod miso, snapper carpaccio. Best:  Wagyu steak. The other few courses were meh. Not worth mentioning.   Courses were rather small, especially if you are sharing. Half way through, I knew I would not be completely satisfied, so I ordered a few more items off the menu as fillers. Waiter recommended some sushi rolls. These rolls were \"un-inspired\" (to be very nice). To be honest, they were subpar for a place like this. I have way better rolls at all you can eat places. @ $25/roll, they should live up to the price.   Very good service overall, but its very odd that they seem to not want to show you a menu. They would rather recommend things to you. It took several requests to actually get a menu. I see why. Their prices are crazy sky high for the quality. Examples: Min $6-15/piece nigiri. $25/sushi roll.  We've been to Kabuto -  Nobu is no Kabuto in terms of quality and don't rate these prices.   We've had a few truly memorable meals in vegas more than $300/couple. Guy Savoy, Alize, SW Steak, Kabuto.  This was probably least memorable.",

    "text": "Their menu is broken down by HOT and COLD dishes.  They might have to add a LUKE WARM section unfortunately.  What happened to this place? I've been a Nobu fan for years. Las Vegas was my first followed by London, NY, Hawaii, and San Diego.  Well, I ordered the miso cod.  It was not hot, the miso wasn't cooked through (hard to explain), and the skin of the fish was soggy.  I also ordered the Las Vegas special Salmon Nashi which raved about a Japanese pear, truffle salts, and unforgettable other ingredients.  While the concept seems interesting, the execution was flawed.  The pear portion size to the salmon sashimi doesn't work.  Its far too big and takes away from the salmon leaving a confusing fruit and raw fish situation.  Also, the cuts of pear and salmon were inconsistent - just bad.  I spoke with the server and the man behind the sushi bar.  To sum it up they shrugged their shoulders.  They did not offer a better replacement or any other dish to maybe turn my experience around.  I hope other Nobu locations stay True.  I recommend skipping the one in Las Vegas.",

Nobu is a solid 4 stars for food & drink, but for the price it's an easy 3 star place in my book...and this from someone that routinely enjoys paying inflated Strip prices for excellent quality food & drink.",

I just kept comparing it to my favorite, which is kind of unfair. However, this time was different...very memorable in a good way.   My server Gordon and his waitstaff team's service was amazing! I had the locals tasting menu ($75) and it was worth every penny. Every dish was cordially described in just the right amount of detail before being served. All questions were answered in a friendly manner. The atmosphere was very nice and classy as well. Beautiful decor.   -Kobe Beef Taco (as an appetizer, separate from tasting menu)...best taco ever! beef was soft and moist  -Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno (best sashimi i've ever had by far! so soft and fresh. price tag aside, i could go for 10 of these plates! though that might be too much of a good thing) -Tuna Sashimi Salad (love it. best tuna ever)  -Rock Shrimp Tempura with Creamy Spicy (best shrimp ever...you're getting the point! i didnt know shrimp could taste this good)  -Black Cod Miso (this and the yellowtail sashimi were my favorite dishes...high praise for these 2 seems to be the trend based off of many reviews. definitely no disagreement here. best fish ever! if you are ordering one item, i highly recommend it)  -Assorted Sushi and Miso Soup (basics but pretty good. large scallops were added to the soup. unique taste and interesting twist compared to standard miso soup. delicious!)  -Dessert (strawberry, vanilla, green tea mochi ice cream)...all were great. not really a complaint, but a variety of desserts is preferred. im sure they would be amazing like everything else as well.  Thank you Nobu, for one of the best dining experiences ever. I will definitely be back!",

Awesome team.   Now, food. Personally, skip the taco apps, nothing special to note there. The rock shrimp had a bit too much sauce for even that type of dish. DO go for the Chilean Sea Bass with dry miso. It's perfectly cooked in a buttery-citrusy sauce bed; the dry miso on top adds texture and will make your mouth water. A dish that is both simple yet complex on its own. Also, the uni shooter was absolutely delish, with the right balance of sauce and meat. I had a spicy acai cocktail which was one of the best cocktails I've had in a while!! Yum. I was too tired to remember what else we had. Wish we came earlier to try the rest of the menu.",

    "text": "Nobu deserves its place with the absolute top eateries in Vegas.  As with its LA and Honolulu counter parts, Nobu Las Vegas uses only the freshest ingredients.  As with all other locations, the nigiri sushi is very skillfully prepared but as with all other locations, why fill up on simple sushi when there are so many great, mouthwatering, fusion dishes to try.  On recent visits, the king crab and avocado ceviche was excellent and so was the lobster and fresh shitake salad.  The broiled yellowtail collar is a must try.  Perfectly cooked.  The sweetness of the fish just explodes in your mouth.  Although its not sustainable seafood, the Chilean sea bass with dried miso.... ahhhhh heaven.  Finally, you cannot go wrong with the king crab tempura.  Prices are in line with restaurants of this caliber.  Special note, if you are from Hawaii, you will find the prices at this location 30-50 percent higher than in Honolulu for similar dishes.  Service is excellent.  The wine list is OK and in line with Vegas pricing.   As with all Nobu restaurants, I prefer to drink extra vodka or gin martinis with their food.  It pairs well and cleans the palate between bites and courses.  Baller status for sure.",

    "text": "Came to this location around my birthday, and was not that impressed with all the rave reviews I have heard, and read about the place. Situated in the Hard Rock Hotel, on a night there were more industry people here from a convention drinking up beers and having what I deem fusion food.   One of the dishes that stood out, tempura uni, as it was definitely interesting on the menu, and the price was about right, until it came to the table as one piece, and the rest was vegetable bits. I know you are supposed to be high end, but don't tease that way. And uni should only be eaten raw and fresh, as it was a waste to deep fry this sucker, and practically turn it to goo.  I felt like I was at a bar & grill then I was in a high end restaurant the day I was here, as it felt like an \"industry night\". The dishes that came to our table were nicely presented, for the price your paying, I guess some art work must be done to the plate to be able to charge you.  It is an experience, and maybe I was here on an off day. Harder to get to as it is off the strip.",

    "text": "Perfect end to our epic Girls Vacay!  I want to give a special shout out to our server who rocked (pun intended). The service was phenomenal!   Our theme of the weekend turned out to be LMFAO's 'Sorry for Party Rockin' and when we told our server he let us keep our zen rocks, get it? Rocking! Aw, good times.  Must haves: - Black Cod with Miso  - Toro Sashimi (Shout out to our waiter who helped me trick my friends who were squimish about trying fatty Bluefin tuna belly. He told them it was compliments of the chef. After they fell in love with it we told them the truth and enjoyed a good laugh about it.) - Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno - Spicy Tuna Rolls  - Dessert: The chef's tasting platter was so yummy that someone swooped on a part of mine. They even put candles on it for the girls birthdays.  I would also like to note that the presentation of dishes was extremely entertaining. Their descriptions are as magical as the flavors. I want to give a special thanks to the server who served Jessica H.'s dish with such an amazing description that it left the entire table wishing we had ordered chicken teriyaki.  At this point I must admit that our two large Daigijo sakes prevent me from making any other recommendations. I can honestly say that the food and service were amazing and the tab was worth every penny. I cannot wait to go back or perhaps try the NYC location.  Side Bar:  Bathroom situation: I hated that the bathroom was outside the restaurant and is shared with the not so lovely patrons of Rehab Day Club. At least Hard Rock was nice enough to install a syringe disposal.   On the bright side we also found out that Nobu will be opening a location at Cesar's Palace, which I think will be a much better fit for this fabulous culinary experience.  The table next to us was doing Omakase style. So jelly, it looked amazing! When I go to the Cesar's location I will be doing Omakase.",

Went with a bunch of friends and ordered up about 6 dishes along with drinks and sake. Some of the dishes we had were: - lobster tempura - 5 stars - so flavorful meaty chunks of fresh lobster tail deep fried with a thin layer of tempura along with 4 different delicious sauces - black cod with miso sauce served in lettuce shells - 5 stars - fantastic - yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno - 5 stars - fantastic and yummy pieces of yellowtail with jalapeno and also soaking in a delicious light sauce (no need to add own soy sauce) - ahi tuna in special light sauce - 5 stars fantastic too - chucks of ahi tuna in little mini taco shells - 3 stars - the flavor of the tuna was lost among the deep fried taste of the taco shells - beef tenderloin - 3 stars - was nice but nothing too special  The atmosphere is elegant but cool with a nice Vegas buzz and liveliness. This elegant Japanese place seemed a bit oddly located in the crazy and informal confines of the Hard Rock Casino. Service was excellent and attentive - we had basically asked our server to choose a set of dishes for us and I would say most of the selections were awesome.  Bottom line: Definitely had some fantastic dishes here but don't think it was worth the exorbitant prices. Probably could find the same quality of food for half the price at some other very nice Japanese restaurant.  But highly recommend giving a try if you are charging to the corporate card!",

We order drinks and the host comes up and says she would like to upgrade us to a better table. She was very excited to upgrade us and I thought better is always better. Wrong!!! We were then seated at a small table near the entrance. I looked at the hostess across the room and she was laughing. Apparently someone else wanted our table. I should have walked out right there. It was embarrassing and my party was very humiliated.  I called the manager over and he of course apologized and comped edamame. $8.00 worth of free beans was not nearly going to make up for this humiliating experience. They later moved us to a quiet table in the back. Then the \"tasting\" menu was sold to us at a rate of $100 per plate. It wasn't worth $10.00 per plate I've had better sushi from a grocery store. I actually spit out two spoiled pieces of fish.The food made 6 people in our party deathly ill. Stay away. I hope that host gets fired. Who does that? She is a liar!!!!",

I quickly logged on to yelp to check the latest reviews as i do with any restaurant, and I am happy to say that I am ecstatic I did this, because had i not, I would have missed out on the Black cod with miso.... which is without a doubt, one the best things that I have ever tasted.   My BF and I shared 4 dishes and 1 dessert, washed it down with 2 sapporo's each, and by the time we were done, we could barely walk!  Yellowtail Sashimi with jalapeno - DELICIOUS!!!! the sauce may be just a bit overpowering but delicious nonetheless. I couldnt even taste the jalapeno :)  Lobster Ceviche - I have no clue why they are calling this \"ceviche\" but I wish we would have ordered something else instead. It was merely OK,  It just kind of tasted like cold lobster in lettuce - but hey, i love lobster so  its all good :)  Black Cod with Miso - OMG - I just got goosebumps thinking about this dish. It is hands down the best thing i have ever put in my mouth. I like how crunchy and  soft it is..  delicioso~  Shrimp tempura roll - your basic roll ..    Bento Box dessert ( flourless chocolate cake with Green tea ice cream) YUM YUM YUM YUM - this is a great combination - not too much,  shared with someone special is a perfect way to satisfy your sweet tooth.  Will definitely come back - Loved the all male service - everyone was really nice and our waiter pretty much gave us his thoughts on all the menu items and gave us some nice suggestions - that in hindsight, i should have taken.   But hey, theyre's always next time!!",

One example: we ordered a sashimi dinner and instead of  indicating the various fish that the chef chose, he dumped the plate on our table and left immediately. I felt like I was being served by a brooding, bitter member of a failing rock band that had taken this job because he had to pay the bills. I would had some sympathy if the restaurant was busy, but half the tables were empty because our reservations were towards the end of the night. Maybe he was pissed because of that, but for $400, I'm inclined to not give a shit about that and want some proper service.  Having said that, I would have rated Nobu somewhere between 4-5 stars based purely on their food. The environment was pleasant but not that impressive. I'd like to come back some day, and maybe I will when the memories of the sub-par service fade.",

I want to leave the table full and buzzing and humming about how awesome the food was. This meal was, frankly, lousy.  Nearly everything that came out was drenched in citrus, which overpowered the fish. Isn't fish supposed to be the showpiece of a good sushi restaurant? And, honestly, that's the only real takeaway I had from this meal. Too much citrus. Everything.   I'll save my Omakase dollars for Austin's Uchi. Now *that's* transcendent.",

The Yellowtail with jalapeno and yuzu was by far the best and the big eye tuna and tempura shrimp were good as well, but not worth twice the price of a decent sushi place. I don't know what exactly I was expecting, but this definitely fell short.  Although the cucumber lychee martini was delicious. I would come back to try the hot dishes if someone else was picking up the tab, otherwise I think Pink Taco would probably be just as satisfying.

    "text": "My buddy and I went to Nobu this past Friday night at 9:30 for their omasake chef choice tasting menu. We had very few disappointments. They sat us right away at the bar, tables would have been 15 minutes even with our reservations.  Lots of good energy in the restaurant, lots of Japanese yelling back and forth from the waiters and sushi chefs.  We split a $50 bottle of nonfiltered very fragrant Nigori Sake cold which was smooth and easy to drink. The small bits of rice at the bottle of the bottle reminded me of red wine sediment as a good thing.   The first course came out quick and cold. A chilled patty of Toro tartar in a soy wasabi sauce topped with caviar, served with a baby silver spoon.  It was tender, smooth, rich and melt in your mouth.  The caviar was not memorable.  An A+ start and an expensive dish on their regular menu. Next was 4 pieces per plate of thin cut fresh octopus topped with a cilantro leaf, a dot of super hot sauce, finished with citrus, like ceviche.  Pretty good.  Next was another cold appetizer of rice paper wrapped greens with a piece of raw ebi sweet shrimp, dressed with a fantastic sesame ginger sauce with a fried prawn head on the side.  My buddy especially liked the tempura batter on the shrimp head and the dressing.  I will personally come to your house and kill you if you do not eat the fried prawn head.   Then started the hot plates.  First was the ever famous Black Miso Cod, a bit too sweet for my buddy but it did not keep us from both licking the plates.  A small piece of tender fish which just went on and on and kept melting in our mouths.  Flavor of fish hard to come through past miso and sweetness.  like fish candy in a good way.  My friend said that an improvement would be to torch and crisp up the skin before putting on the sauce which would give some texture contrast and make the dish over the top.  $23 on the regular menu.  Next was the beef tenderloin toban yaki style with a shitake and enokitake mushrooms and a piece of thin asparagus in a soy broth. Beef very lean, not as melt in your mouth as I would like.  My buddy would have liked a nice piece of ribeye cap instead but who wouldn't.  The dish is served spitting hot on a mini hot plate and when they raise the cover in front of you, the steam envelopes you warmly.  Try not to get the grease on you.   Next was the nigiri sushi course of 5 pieces along with a nice clam miso soup. We got a piece of red snapper (mmmm), magura tuna (so tender), yellowtail (yum), clam (a bit tough) and sea eel which was the most tender fall apart sea eel I have ever tasted.  The sushi rice and soup fill you to the gills by that point and then they hit you with the dessert which was a bento presentation of a warm flowerless chocolate lava cake with lots of lava and very little cake and a very good not sweet green tea ice cream.   This just put the nail in the coffin.  We were stuffed, but we couldn't stop eating since it was so good.    The restaurant closed at 11pm on a Friday night, but we will remember the meal for a long time coming.  Next time I'm in vegas I plan to make it a point to return and see what the chef choice is at that point in time.  This was the $100 omasake.  The $150 would have added some kobe beef and lobster here and there.  We were very happy with our choice.  I think the meal was an absolute bargain for the price.",

    "text": "Nobu would have gotten the 5th star, except for the loud music, and the decidedly non-intimate seating. My wife and I aren't opposed to answering a question about a dish, but when the folks next to you can lean over and check out what you're eating, well...I understand that that's the place's image, but it just keeps it from being a 5-star dining experience, IMO.  We went on a Sunday night at 7:30p. We were seated immediately, and our server brought the drink menus. My wife had the Passion Mojito, and I stuck with a Sapporo because I'm not a huge fan of sake. The drink menu was replaced with the dinner menu, but we were pretty sure we were going to have the Omakase.  There are two basic \"levels\" of Omakase...each is composed of a mixture of cold dishes, hot dishes, sushi, and dessert. The lower-priced version ($100) contains more traditional dishes, and the higher priced version ($135) was said to be more \"exotic\". We both opted for the latter. I was trying to listen to the explanation of each dish and then scribble them down, so I likely missed some of the little accompaniments/garnishes.   - Kumamoto Oyster, on the half-shell, with Nobu Salsa - Sweet Shrimp (sashimi-style, no rice, and no tempura head) - Some kind of shellfish sashimi-style (either scallop or clam, I'm leaning towards scallop, based on the texture and the menu offerings) All three of these items were served on the same plate, the latter two with, I think, ponzu sauce. The oyster was pretty large, such that I didn't want to pick the shell up and end up wearing some of it. The sweet shrimp was very rich and quite tasty, and what I'm assuming was the scallop was a little firmer than I would expect, but still very good.  - Kampachi sashimi with kelp and mushroom  Kampachi is one of my favorite fish, and this did not disappoint. The kelp and mushroom, I think, were kept subtle so as not to overpower the fish...you could actually skip the kelp and mushrooms if you were trying to save room for later.   - New-style unagi (lightly seared) layered with shiitake over a bed of tofu, with uni on the side They have a really good sauce for the uni, because I don't like uni, and this tasted great! :) The unagi was also wonderful when prepared like this, as the meat is very tender, and no powerful marinade.  - Toro salad with vegetable spring roll I wasn't crazy about the spring roll...I thought it was bland. The toro salad, however, was very good.  - Green tea & Ume sorbet I guess this was a palate cleanser? I wasn't expecting to get something like this in the middle of the meal. After the server brought it out, I told my wife, \"Thank you for dining at Nobu, please come back soon.\" Anyway, it was not overly sweet, and would be fine as a dessert after a big meal.  - Broiled snapper over risotto with snow crab meat, topped with a white truffle chip  The hot dishes started with a small chunk of snapper that was done pretty much perfectly, no color, but still very juicy. The risotto was OK, nothing special, but the rice went well with the fish.  - Small, sliced, grilled \"Kobe\" beef tenderloin with Okinawa potatoes served alongside a slice of grilled Japanese eggplant topped with a small piece of grilled foie gras. I'm going to commit heresy in a bit...I put Kobe in quotes, because I hear a bunch of stories about whether or not Kobe is Kobe, but this tenderloin was done rare, and the potatoes went nicely with it. Great dish. I don't really like eggplant, but this was OK, so they did something right. I'd never had foie gras before, and, well, meh? There, I said it.  - Miso soup with clam Another break, like the sorbet. It wasn't bad or anything, but I was getting kinda full, so I almost skipped it. (almost).  - Nigiri sampler: Oh Toro, pink snapper, sardine, snow crab, jumbo clam The clam was fresh and crunchy, but the snow crab was pretty ordinary. This was only the second time I've had sardine nigiri. I like sardine under other circumstances, but for sushi, I think it's just too oily? I couldn't tell the difference between the pink snapper and, say, fresh tai, but it was very firm and tasty. My wife told me the Oh Toro was awful and that I should consider letting her eat it for me, as she didn't want it to ruin my dinner. I love her very much, but in matters of sushi, she is not to be trusted. :) Try the Oh Toro.  - Blancmange (yogurt, in this case) over almond crisp, pomegranate seeds, and assorted frozen berries. Full. I almost had to pass on dessert (almost). Again, not overly sweet, which is a plus in my book, and the berries and almond crisp combined very well.   The service was tremendous, as the restaurant has a large waitstaff, so dishes are cleared away promptly, but we were not rushed. Our section filled up towards the latter half of the meal, but the staff were able to keep up with no problems.  If you're a fan of this type of Japanese food, check it out - it's pricey, but you're in Vegas, so live a little!",

It was the most interesting and exotic meal I have every had.  Each course was brought out and explained, with no knowledge of the next dish. Everything was fresh and tasty.  Would highly recommend if you are up for adventurous dining!",

    "text": "Hmmm, good fish, good food...but at what cost? I went here with my cousin and we had a nice meal with the obligatory beers and sake. We each dropped $150, and I left hungry. Can I get a \"Fuck You?\" It's understandable but annoying as a local when a gourmet chain restaurant charges way more in Las Vegas than in other cities.  Didn't eat any sushi rolls, instead got some non-roll items like Tataki where they basically cut up some fish, splay it out in a circle on a plate all fancy, add a smattering of scallions, drizzle some ponzu-type sauce atop, and charge you $25.   I guess it's worth it once in a while, but NOT the kobe beef dish. We'd been told the kobe beef was phenom, so we ordered reluctantly after seeing the price: $20/ounce, 4-ounce minimum. $80 for a SMALL beef dish? Yikes! Maybe it wouldn't have hurt so much if the beef was good (great would've helped), but nope -- the beef was just some regular-assed beef, not particularly tender or flavorful. I kinda wish I'd used the $80 for something worthwhile, like a Tarot reading. At least I would've seen the future, bitches!",

    "text": "my favorite restaurant thus far! Everything we ate was a culinary masterpiece. The hub & I went with the 2nd level Omakase menu. As we understood it, the 1st level is a sampling of their menu items, whereas the 2nd level allows for more creativity (and better ingredients) by  your chefs. Maybe it was being in Vegas, but why not - we're at Nobu! High roll it all the way! Our courteous waiter proceeded to ask us if there was anything that we were allergic to or simply did not like. While I'm game for anything, i appreciated the question.  We were surprised to receive a complimentary appetizer (I think because we were first timers - and duh, we ordered the most expensive option on the menu already!) of the Spicy Miso Chips with tuna tartar - Excellent! It was followed by 4 succulent cold dishes, a peach sorbet to 'clean our palettes', 3 mouthwatering hot dishes, a clear clam broth, a plate of nigiri and then a deliciously light chocolate dessert (i dont even know how to describe it, and i was raised in a bakery!) with fresh berries made special by the pastry chef. These were plates PER PERSON. I won't go into the details of each plate cuz there were too many, and none of it is on the menu anyway since they make it up for you on that day - but we were literally in HEAVEN. Time stopped still and it wasn't till we walked out that I realized we had been there for 3 hours!  I kid you not, everything that I ate here that night, my tastebuds had NEVER tasted before. Even the exotic nigiri was a whole 'nother level of meat. My Nobu experience was completely unique of anything i've ever had.  While its a pricey meal, it's one that I will gladly shell out for",

    "text": "5 stars all-around for this awesome establishment. We had a Groupon, which we paid $100 bucks for the Signature Five-Course Tasting Menu for Two People. Every single piece of fish was fresh and delicious. You could tell this wasn't your average sushi restaurant.   1st course: tai sashimi dry miso (FAVORITE DISH!!!!) 2nd course: yellowtail jalapeno roll, two-piece salmon with wasabi salsa sushi, two-piece scallop tiradito sushi, and two-piece tuna sushi 3rd course: rock shrimp tempura with creamy spicy sauce 4th course: black cod with miso  5th course: dessert (chocolate cake, green tea ice cream and mixed berries)  I have zero to no complaints about the courses offered. My partner and I thoroughly enjoyed the quality sushi at this place. This is a fancy restaurant, so the portions were expected to be small. If you walk in expecting huge servings, you definitely picked the wrong restaurant, lol.  We went on a weeknight with a reservation, so service was super quick and attentive. I ordered the Peruvian Caipirinha cocktail too, which had an awesome kick with the ginger beer.  Overall, this was a steal of a deal. We paid an additional $20 bucks + 20% tip (~$20) for the course. All in all, we paid about $140 for a delicious five-course tasting menu. The service was also great. We were treated really well even with our Groupon and was checked upon multiple times throughout the night. I was really impressed and left feeling satisfied with the entire experience. I'd highly reccomend this place for any date night!",

He spent time to get to know our tastes and make menu suggestions. Our glasses were never empty and he was extremely aware of my wife's allergies and accommodated her. The drinks were amazing the Japanese whiskey menu was extremely deep with several price points. I had the martini that was made with bellevadere and saki served with cucumbers. It was so good light and refreshing and paired well with the sushi. Since this was my first time at Nobu I opted for the waiter to choose my 7 course meal for 125 dollars per person. I was not disappointed, all the courses of sushi were very unique and super fresh.  I can't recommend this place enough it's worth every dollar spent because you will never have a unique dining experience like this!",

(As an aside, the Caesar's Palace location is newer and busier but given that this is the original Vegas location, it appears more logical to start here if you have never experience Nobu before.)   Given that we were not famished, we asked the waitress to help us craft a light menu that still allowed us to experience Chef Matsuhisa. We started off with mocktails followed by Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno (which had just the right kick and freshness). Then we had the New Style Sashimi (Salmon), followed by Black Cod, and finally two sushi rolls, the soft shell crab and shrimp tempura. Overall, the dishes were varied, flavorful, and yet light.   We ended the night with recommended dessert - Sata Andagi - which I was admittedly unsure about upfront - however, after experiencing it, I was surprised I had never tried such an amazing dessert combination before. The Apricot Doughnut was one of the best desserts I've had and was perfectly complimented by white chocolate crumbs and the black tea ice cream.   Overall, the ambiance, vibe, and service was a great foundation for a memorable meal at the original Las Vegas Nobu. I look forward to visiting again.",

    "text": "Nobu was an amazing experience for me. My bf took me here for an anniversary dinner and it was exceptional!   We were greeted by the host and she took us to our table. I do know it is Vegas so there were other large parties there which were ready to party so it was a bit loud. It was a little hard to talk without having a lot of background noise.   But let's talk about the food. I tried the wagyu tacos which were ant sized but it was nice to try them. The scallops were very tasty but it was such a strong flavor that the more you keep eating it, you grow a little tired and need something else to balance it out. We also tried the yellowtail sashimi which was also good. My favorite dish hands down were the uni scoops in a spoon. Our waiter recommended it and it was to die for! The flavor and art the chef put into that little scoop was worth every single bite.",

Plates were replaced after each course.   Food: Amazing!! Small tapas style portions for sharing. Quality and flavor were out of this world.  We ordered:  Edamame - good  Shishito peppers - sauce was great for these  Yellowtail with Jalapeno- Amazing!

    "text": "First time here.  So awkward to have a Nobu in this hotel though, I don't think it fits in.  Staff was attentive and fish was really fresh.  We were actually quite surprised when we went through the front and was led to our table: the place looks like a cafeteria with tables very close to each other.  Luckily there were no one next to us so we didn't ask to change a location.  And the disposable chopsticks make it feel more like a cafeteria...it's just like eating with plastic forks and spoons...  We had the tasting menu and there were 5 courses.  They served us some soba fritters to start with, and it was quite disappointing.  It was way too greasy and strong tasting food to start the dinner, and I needed to wash it down with lots of water.  It should be paired with Chinese tea...lol  The first 2 courses were a Shiromi Usuzukuri with ponzu and assorted nigiri sushi, the white fish was really fresh and the tuna was really good too.    The next 2 courses were hot dishes, and for the first hot dish we got to pick between shrimp tempura and pan seared scallops.  We picked the scallops because we were never a big fan of deep fried food.  But the server made a mistake and served us the tempura, we told them that was not what we ordered, and they brought the scallops without taking away the shrimp, so we had both dishes to try out! (YAY!) The shrimp was very similar to the walnut shrimp you can find in Chinese restaurants, only without the walnuts..I find this dish quite another bummer.  But then the pan seared scallops with edamame hummus came to the rescue and it was so so GOOD!! The scallops were fresh and huge, and the hummus really complements the scallops!  Then the second hot dish was the Black cod miso: very very delicious, love it!!!  The last course was dessert and we got the SUNTORY CAPPUCCINO which had many layers  including Coffee Cream, Whisky Foam & Milk Ice Cream. It tasted like tiramisu in some ways, but a lot more tasty. Very light and not too sweet.  All in all, even though there are some flaws here and there, the dining experience was superb and full of surprises.",

I wish I'd gotten our waiter's name because he was phenomenal - really enhanced the visit to unforgettable.  The food was insanely good. Meats like butter, roll and pieces innovative and delightful, mushrooms fragrant and cooked through, and the dessert - don't even get me started. We spent a bit extra and tried all three pieces that made Chef Nobu famous and indulged in some Japanese craft beer as well.I can't for the life of me use chopsticks (better half a pro) so I was embarrassed to ask for a fork but he was totally cool about it, unlike some ramen places in Austin, TX.  Lovely atmosphere, lovely waitstaff, amazing food.  (plus I got engaged here so yay! They gave us special truffles and keepsake rocks that hold the chopsticks.)",

    "text": "This place is amazing! Drinks, food, servers, atmosphere-- everything was great and we had a great time!  First off, the server was great. He did an excellent job explaining all the drinks, dishes, and dinner style to us, and he was a great sport joking around with us, as we were there for a bachelorette. We looked at the menu to decide if we wanted to order our own dishes or do their family style / chef-chosen dishes. He told us he could get us full / satisfied for ~$50-60, so we decided to go with their shared style dishes.   About the family style: he asked a few questions about dishes we liked, our taste, and whether we liked fish / red meat, and they came out with a bunch of dishes for us to try. Overall, we had 6 dishes, and they were all really great. 1) Yellowtail jalapeno. We specifically asked for this dish, but it was already on their list for us. This dish was so delicious; the fish was so good and the flavor was amazing. 2) Salmon sashimi. This was very good too (but I did like the previous one more). 3) Popcorn shrimp. This dish was okay; some of the girls really liked it, and it was good, but it didn't stand out to me. 4) Yellowtail collar. One of the girls asked for this dish, and it was amazing. The meat was very tender and flavored very well. 5) Steak. We all got one piece of this steak, and it was very delicious. Extremely tender and so yummy. 6) Cod in lettuce wrap. The cod was so good, and I wish there were more in that little lettuce wrap.  Overall, we weren't stuffed, but satisfied. The food was all really great, and we all liked our drinks too. Try their special martinis! I had the elderflower and lychee and it was great.   I definitely want to come back and try more dishes!!",

If you just want to dress nice and post an IG pic flexing that you're rich, by all means come eat your gas station quality fish. If you order the spicy edamame, expect maple syrup on it. This is the only time I had to force myself to swallow my food. There is a place called Kabuso and Yuzu in LA that makes this place seem as if you bought your food at 7-11. The rolls only taste like seaweed and old rice. Bring a magnifying glass and tweezers for your fish tacos. Please, go have a steak instead.",

    "text": "There's a Groupon for Nobu?!! Whaaaat!?! Yes, believe it! I had purchased a Groupon for a 5 course tasting menu for $80 for 2 people. And my BF was super excited because he has been wanting to try this place for a while now. It was actually perfect timing that this Groupon became available because I was going to be in Vegas this weekend. *woot woot!* Anyways, I made reservations for 2 at 6PM online and got an e-mail confirmation right away. The Groupon can only be used at the Nobu inside the Hard Rock hotel. There's also a Nobu inside Caeser's Palace. Once we checked in with the hostesses, we were immediately seated at a nice comfy table and were greeted with a big welcome in Japanese! The decor inside was really nice and elegant. I really liked the bamboo wall they had. I also thought it was really cute that we each had a rock on our table used as a chopstick holder.   Ok onto the food! So we started off with some edamame with sea salt, which was nothing too special but was good. Next came the best sashimi I had ever had in my life! Its yellowtail sashimi with a jalapeno slice on top dressed in almost like a ponzu sauce. The flavors went really well together and the yellowtail was fresh and spicy. Yumm!!! I can probably eat like five more of that dish. :P The next dish was also another one of their popular dishes: the shrimp tempura. I was really surprised that the shrimp didn't look at all like the usual tempura found at Japanese restaurants. The dish almost looked like honey walnut shrimp actually but tasted ten times better. It was rich and creamy. And the sauce it was covered in was deliscious. Next came their black cod dish. My BF absolutely loved this one and I can see why. It was so flakey and cooked to perfection. The fish melted in our mouths like butter and it was sweet and savory. Next came a plate of sushi, which consisted of a califonia roll and 6 pieces of sashimi sushi. This dish was nothing too fancy and didn't stand out too much. But it was still tasty. And lastly we got our dessert! It was such a cute looking dessert, which composed of a green tea ice-cream, a flourless chocolate cake, and a cuppacino cup. OMG...so good!!! The green tea ice-cream is made in house and  after one bite and you definetely know it's green tea ice-cream. The cuppacino cup was probably my favorite out of the other 2 desserts because it was so beautifully crafted and tasted heavenly. The chocolate cake was very fluffy and not too sweet. Overall, everything we tried was excellent! The reason why I subtracted 1 star was because both my BF and I felt that the cod and the shrimp was slightly on the saltier side and all of the dishes are pretty small plates to share between 2 people. Otherwise, customer service here was superb and our server was just so friendly and informative on the dishes we were trying. I'm so happy to get to try Nobu for the first time! =) So go get your Groupon, while it's still available peeps!!",

Its a little overpriced for what it is, they need to do more FOOD, I left hungry.  That shouldnt happen.  Service 98 out of 100.  Food 95 out of 100  Value 80 out of 100.   I think it was a little overpriced, but the quality was totally there!   I would definitely go again, and I think I would love it again, but it let me down just a little, after hearing all the hype.   I could go here once , or go to sushi mon 4 times, all I can eat, you know my choice on that one if I want sushi 4 times!     After the sticker shock, which I didnt pay so I dont care what it costs, the food was insanely good.  We had the saki, beers, and a feast of sashimi, shrimp, miso soup, and rolls.   My favorite was the lettuce wrapped black cod, oh my god, this was the BEST FISH bite I have ever had.  It melted in your mouth like butter from the fat and the protein - I am not sure if it was oil pan fried, or what, it was hot, but not too hot, but it had a little sizzle on it, and the glazed oil on it just added to the silky flavor.  I would go back there just for that!   The desert was a rhubarb molten love with ice cream over it, talk about yummy!   Tasted like strawberries to me, but it was perfect, I would have taken one more scoop of Icecream, next time I will ask.   I am sure they would accommodate.     5 star food at 5 star prices.      Decor was a little drab to me, I dont know what it was, it was classy, but too dark, the bamboo was nice, but I think they could use some LIVE FISH Tank in the place, maybe I missed something, the walkway in was nice, but the dining room was a little drab for me.  I think a splash of color would have been nice.   Anyway, I am nitpicking now and thats not fair to them.    Quality stuff, Incredible food, great dining room, great location at Hard Rock.  Highly Recommended.  Please bring your wallet, or someone elses, you will need it!     Also, be prepared for a late night snack later meal after, unless you are on a diet.    4.5 Star Overall, I likey!",

Oh, can't forget the alcohol. I had some Nobu. If you're into Sushi...it's a must go to at least once.",

    "text": "Went in with high expectations, but was deeply disappointed.  Let me preface this review by saying that we went in with a Groupon.  Yes, Nobu is offering a Groupon haha!  For $100 you get their most popular dishes for two, including the hamachi with jalapenos, rock shrimp, miso black cod, plus dessert.    OK, I get that we're Groupon customers, I understand sometimes we get treated like second class citizens, so my expectations were adjusted, but they managed to not even meet my Groupon expectations.  First of all the portions were way too small.  There were only five thin slices of Hamachi to share between two people.  The rock shrimp came out in a nice size bowl, while that's good enough for one person, this is meant for two!  There was also one piece of black cod too to share between two people.  I would say if you do this deal you guys better be very comfortable eating out of the same plate or bowl haha.    I also must say I'm not generally a big fan of fusion cuisine.  Nobu did not change my mind.  These are their most popular dishes, but they feel dated and uninspiring.  Perhaps because they've been around for a while and many other places now carry the same things?  The rock shrimp was slathered in this orange color mayo sauce, which reminded me of the walnut shrimp dish so often served in Chinese restaurants these days.  The cod had a very sweet miso sauce that kind of ruined the natural flavor of the fish itself.    Not good value and not a place I would go into looking for high quality and inventive food.",

This location not as swanky as the one in Caesars Palace  nevertheless is a signature restaurant for the Hard Rock Hotel and a little more casual than 35 Steaks next door. The elegant dining room with Bamboo thrown in the ceiling and minimal decor in a Zen sort of way it's warm and inviting.  To start the yellowtail sashimi was superb, delicate sensuous .The crispy tempura rock shrimp drenched in a yuzu spicy sauce over salad greens was tangibly addicting. The picture of the Black Cod in miso should be posted as the Wikipedia definition of umami simple, savory and sweet accented by a pickled ginger shoot. The sushi was ordinary but respectable fresh. A nice little green tea ice cream for dessert to complete the Nobu experience. The staff were friendly professional rock stars. If you want to feel like a baller the groupon deal is the way to go and you be treated to a nice multi-course adventure by one of Japan's best chef.  Kampai.",

The dai ginjo sake (no more bamboo for awhile now)  Ahi tuna sashimi appetizer with the amazing sauce and fruit  Perfect, so why short a star?  Service was rushed (to be fair we were  late), and when I called to rconfirm the reservation, I asked them to put a bottle of Veuve on ice for us, couldn't do it without an email and seemed like a hassle.

It's definitely better than your run-of-the-mill sushi joints with a bunch of Americanized rolls but others have really stepped up their high end sushi game (e.g., the Nobu at Caesars, Blue Ribbon at Cosmo, Kabuto on Spring Mountain, etc.) which has left Nobu just average among that set.

I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because of the exceptional staff and the green tea ice cream.   The chef's sushi dinner was third rate.  The fish was the ordinary fare:  tuna, yellow tail, sea urchin, sweet shrimp and unagi nigiri.  Plus tiny spicy tuna rolls.  I wish I could say that at least the fish cuts were exceptional quality.  They were not.  They tasted worse than cheap sushi from a sacramento discount sushi bar.  I gagged several times trying to choke down the fish.

I was trying to catch up and loved the Lychee martini and the Sangria, both of which were recommended by our waiter.  The miso soup was above average, I enjoyed the large pieces of tofu I had the house roll (I don't remember if thats  the exact name) which had four or five different types of sushi.  The sushi was fresh, but I've definitely had better sushi.  I know, I know, I can't compare to the sushi in Hawaii, but even in Chicago, I've had sushi that's so silky in your mouth.  Not a must go restaurant in my book, but definitely not one to snub if you're looking for a sushi night.  Oh, Nickleback was dining there that same night.  So nice eye candy for us ladies.",

    "text": "I love Nobu, although I shouldn't.  The food is just SO good that you have to forgive rude service and ridiculous prices.  Truthfully, the service hasn't always been rude, but I have had two experiences that were less that desirable during the last five times I went.  Let's knock out the negatives really quickly.  Once, they lost my reservation.  No big deal, but they acted like they were doing me a favor by providing a table 45 minutes later.  Whatever.    The other thing was pretty funny actually.  Some people would be bothered by this, but I laughed.  Once, I took a client who had a bit too much to drink, I guess.  When we were seated, he was looking at the chopsticks that were balancing against a rock and asked the waitress if the rock was intended as a tool to get her attention.  She didn't laugh.  Instead, she chose to tell our entire table, \"Not unless you want me to spit in your food.\"  Not too professional for such a highly regarded restaurant, but then again he was being a dumbass.  On to the food.  Yes, it is amazing.  No, I cannot tell you why.  Everything I have ever tasted here was exceptional.  The price is the only negative.  The toro nigiri is to die for even at $20 a piece, or whatever it was.  I once ordered three Kobe beef appetizers for a group.  I guess I should have asked the price first because they were $180 each!  Good news is that they were delicious and expensed.  I also recall having some tasty sea bass here.  Nothing has ever disapponted.  The location is inside of the Hard Rock Hotel.  It isn't very large, so be sure to have a reservation in advance.  Sitting at the sushi bar is also a fun experience, which I definitely recommend at least once.",

We were disappointed with the decor, which is fairly decent modern with Asian flair, but lacking from the La Cienega location. It's also quite noisy during busy times so be prepared to either sit very close to your dining companions or speak LOUDER than normal.   The service here was impeccable. Our server was very knowledgeable and courses arrived exactly on schedule. Dishes, once finished, promptly removed.   The only disappointment I noticed was a difference in menu prices than the other locations, but expect the same food. We opted for omakase and it was definitely worth it. A much better choice than ordering a la carte.   I'd go back for a fun, casual dinner, but don't expect a serene ambiance. It's fairly lively inside.",

All of the food we ordered was absolutely delicious, perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The sushi and sashimi were served at the perfect temperature, and everything tasted absolutely fresh.    Spicy Miso Chips w/Scallop Sashimi Squid Pasta Miso-Glazed Black Cod - (A Nobu specialty and the best piece of fish I've ever eaten) A Selection of Sashimi and sushi including yellowtail, fluke, salmon avocado roll, and yellowtail scallion roll. Flourless Chocolate Cake Bento Box - (As a pastry chef, I'm pretty wary of the whole \"flourless chocolate lava cake\" trend, but this one was fabulous, perfect texture and molten center,  served with white chocolate sauce and green tea ice cream. Yum!)  I'd say the prices were quite reasonable as well.  Keep in mind this -is Vegas, people.  After checking out -many- of the restaurant menus in other hotels I'd say Nobu was absolutely less expensive, and there's no way you're going to get better food quality.  The only half star missing would be for the quality of the service.  The clearing and mise en placing of the table was fabulous, but our waiter was a little too casual.  He seemed almost on the verge of addressing us as \"guys\" or calling my sweetie \"boss\".  Nothing wrong with being friendly, but lets face it this isn't a diner.  A little more dignity would have been appropriate.  Luckily, the professionalism of the runners made up for it.    Yay Nobu!",

Located at the Hard Rock, I was fortunate enough to grab a spot at the sushi bar and partake in the hustle and bustle of the Japanese chefs' banter. Being at the bar allows you to receive great recs on unique dishes (i.e. snapper nigiri with special hot sauce, et al).  For me, what sets Nobu apart is the freshness of the fish, and the perfect cut of fish paired with the perfect amount of rice. It's all about getting that balance right.  In regards to vibes, Nobu is a place to be seen and the interior supports the Asian influence with contemporary.  Be prepared for a long wait if you don't make reservations and remember, there's a premium to be paid for the Nobu brand and quality.",

My wife and I got the omakase - just as we has in New York. However, there was no progression / logic or thought in the Vegas parade of dishes. It seemed that random servers would simply drop stuff on our table with a quick description. In New York, we had one attentive waiter who would explain the dishes as they were delivered and really seemed to know what he was talking about.  I don't know what it is about the Vegas knock offs...Bouchon was dissapointing as well. Word to the wise, go for the real Nobu deal when you are in NYC. In Vegas, get the lame-ass buffet.

    "text": "Just got back from Nobu. I sat at the sushi bar and ended up a little tipsy-er than expected. Even so, here is the review:  Their specialty dishes are really very good. I got both the Toro & Caviar dish and the Live Scallops. Yes. I really did pay $40 for the Toro and Caviar. Was it worth it? At least once. All of their normal sushi stuff was fresh and good, but to be honest, there are a million other sushi places that offer fresh, raw fish for a lot cheaper. So my suggestion? If you are going to go there, make sure to try at least a couple of the specialty dishes.  Decor seemed fine...I was more interested in the lightning hands with uber sharp knife sushi chef. He was not only super cool to watch, but also offered some superb suggestions, even though he clearly only understood a tiny bit of english. Ultra attentive wait staff...maybe even a little too attentive, but I think that is because chairs are so close together at the sushi bar that you can't have more than 1 plate in front of you at a time. In other words, if you didn't have an ultra-attentive wait staff, you wouldn't be able to order more food.  What keeps this place from 5 stars? PRICE. Wicked expensive. Like super-wicked. I know you expect to pay a bunch for good sushi, but this is pretty high. Drinks run $15, specialty items run $20-$40, and any other nigiri hangs at around $10. Though, you should be scared when you notice the no price dillio on their website.I had a great meal for sure, but I don't know if it would be worth $130 again.  I went alone, and didn't feel odd at all. I'd love to say that I'd be back, but the things that could hold me back are the price tag, and the lack of proximity to the strip. That being said, if you are getting some cost assistance (biznass trip), and are staying somewhere close (say...the Alexis Park Hotel), then I'd go for sure.",

All the other sashimi/nigiri/rolls I had were good, but didn't stand out.  The cooked dishes were just okay - we had some sort of sauteed scallops with scallions over rice, chicken and beef, and lobster tacos (these were very good!).  Dessert (pistachio and cherry blossom mochi ice cream balls) had fantastic flavor, but the mochi was very thick and very stiff.

It reflects me so I was bothered, I tried to work it out with the waiter bc I for one was not going to have us pay for HIS mistakes. he was only able to comp 2 oz of the kobe and remove half of the cod.. usually service can ruin a rating but I love the food and forgive the guy, must've been one of those days.",

The food- perfect in every way. We enjoyed a chef's tasting, which was timed perfectly and with no hickups whatsoever. Beautiful and carefully thought out presentations on each course. There is no doubt that Nobu at Hard Rock is the restaurant to go to if you want a personal experience. I hope the management see's this, as the wait staff was ABSOLUTELY FLAWLESS, and I cannot stress that enough. It's the little things that truly count; communication, great timing, menu knowledge, personality, table setting, and genuine care for the guest. A great night with passionate food and good company!

The fried snapper, the waiters favorite, was good but after a few bites it was just overwhelmingly greasy. My mom makes an Asian version but with sweet and sour sauce rather than miso based sauce. It would only be worth ordering if you had a party of 4 or more otherwise it's too greasy for two to share. The service was great but we were rubbing elbows with a couple on a date.

I'm not one to complain about price either but honestly after spending $600 on dinner for 3 people...I left feeling a bit unsatisfied.  Like something was missing.   I'm hoping it was just an off night  for them because I want to really enjoy this place since I stay at the Hard Rock often and it's convenient.",

    "text": "NOBU!!!  WOW!!!  Let me start by saying I am NOT a sushi eater.  Gross!  Well, my friend and my husband went to Nobu at the Hard Rock in LV.  It was the most unbelievable experience ever!  We had the A5 or something like that.  They brought out at least 9 courses including dessert.  Our waitress was Adrian and I think when the food is spectacular and service goes above n beyond it just makes the whole experience that much better.  My favorite fish I think was yellowtail.  All of the raw fish there that I was served was very thin and delicate.  Nothing I ate was fishy or slimy.  I even had the uni.  If you're a sushi rookie then Nobu is the place to start.  Keep in mind too, you get what you pay for.  This is not a cheap restaurant.  Be ready to drop some money.  The manager Kenny who was on duty last night even came over to see what I thought of their restaurant.  I live very close to the Malibu location and cannot wait to check it out!!!  This is my new fav restaurant!!  Don't forget to try the Wagyu Beef.... It just melts in your mouth and the texture is like cashmere, weird huh??  Trust me.... You'll have no regrets!!!  To the staff at Nobu LV:  thank you everyone for the excellent service and I'll definitely be coming back every time we are in town.  Ask for Adrian to be your server!!!",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that the food was excellent.  The reason the place doesn't get 5 or even 4 stars is the service was NOT on the up and up.    I went with 5 other guys celebrating a friend's last days as a bachelor.  When we arrived we were told by our waiter that \"we don't have printed menus, but tell me what types of things you like and I'll customize the menu for you\".   Odd...  This should have raised a red flag right there.    \"Well, obviously we'd like some sushi.  That's why we're here.\" \"Any non-sushi eaters?\" A couple of guys raise their hands... \"Yeah, bring out a chicken dish or something else non-seafood.\" \"Okay, I'll get you guys started.\"  The waiter started bringing out food one platter at a time.  Lobster Tail salad...  Kobe Beef Carpacio (something like that)...  Some kind of tasty dumplings...  3 complete fillet mignon dinners...  and after a break...  2 HUGE platters of sushi!!   When all was said and done, we had been brought enough food for probably 10-12 very hungry people!  Our \"customized\" menu for 6 people consisted of 5 large platters of food PLUS 3 complete steak dinners.  When we questioned our waiter, his response was \"Well that's what you said you wanted.\"  We certainly did NOT want enough food for 12 people.  By the time the sushi came out, we were all stuffed... and this was a group of 6 guys that can really eat.  Of course, we were charged for all of this excessive food that ended up going to waste.  The bill was $1200...  $200 bucks a head.  I don't think I would have had a problem paying $200 for dinner, it was the fact that I had to pay for all this extra food that was unnecessary that bothered me.  To add insult to injury, as we were leaving the restaurant, a table was being seated right in front of us... all the diners had menus in hand.",

Initially, I was a little skeptical of Nobu because it is part of a chain of restaurants. Being a little hungover, a friend and I decided to go since it was within our hotel, the Hard Rock. Despite the restaurant sits in the middle of the desert, the seafood is quite fresh.  The few things that we did try were really good. However, I didn't order away and try as many things as I have wanted to. I had my basic sushi which were hamachi, ikura, and unagi nigiri. Then I had my spicy hotate handroll. I was a little full after that but my friend and I ordered two warm dishes. The calamari pasta should not be missed but the yellowtail collar was slightly overcooked. I wish I had room for their specialty which is the black cod in miso but the calling of my hotel bed and urges of sleep were way too strong for me to resist.",

The waiter suggested lots of interesting dishes like Salmon-Jalapeno sushi, miso-soaked cod, scallops, some kind of bite-sized salmon fried cubes (tastier than it sounds), and some sea urchin sushi.    Cool stuff.  Just wish these fishmongers charged less than $35 for a typical dish because it adds up (note to self:  drink less Sake next time)",

We loved the Black Cod, Yellowtail Sashimi w/Jalapeno & Lobster Ceviche'. Every thing our waitress suggested was so yummy. It was orgasmic as my friend kept saying, LOL!  The portion sizes wouldn't be enough for very man guys I know but, for 4 girls it was perfect. It's not a fancy-shmancy restaurant like I thought it was going to be. It's more casual and not to over the top. Love the warm inviting feel of the bamboo decor. We will definitely be going back the next time were in Vegas!",

We had a variety of fish dishes, some sliced super thin with great seasonings, my favorite was one that had a great ginger finish to it.  If you get the chance to let the waiters pick a variety of dishes for you, I highly recommend it.",

    "text": "Nobu is simply a fantastic restaurant! My family of 5 got the Groupon for couples for food tasting. It's a 5 course meal where they start you off with appetizers, entrees , then dessert. The appetizers given to us (Edemame and peppers) were alright. Nothing special, as you can get them from any restaurant or store. However, what really impressed me greatly at Nobu was the Yellow Fin Tuna Sashimi! I love sashimi, and eat it all the time. However, after eating this, it simply couldn't compare to any sashimi I've had anywheres. The servers were kind enough to recommend us that we don't use Ginger and Wasabi, for this could ruin the taste that the chef wanted in the first palace. I was glad I didn't use ginger/wasabi for this sashimi, since it was simply so tasteful and great! Afterwards, they served us Black Cod and rock shrimp which were great, but nothing crazy. I was sort of disappointed in the last entree they served us, a plate of sushi. It was simply slices of Tuna and Salmon on balls of rice. Nothing special. They also served spicy tuna roll and California roll on the entree. These sushis were simple, nothing great or special. It seemed that Nobu really lacked in that dish. It was just.. Plain. Couldn't Nobu do better than serve a dish that any sushi restaurant could make?   To conclude, service was amazing ! Great and honest staff. The feel and ambience was good and quiet. The lighting was good as well.   I would highly recommend this restaurant, especially the yellow fin tuna sashimi!",

The FOOD ADVENTURE was absolutely delicious.  I cannot even name everything because I am pretty sure they were not all on the menu, but i took some pictures of stuff.  Some of the stuff was:  +Tofu and tuna tartare on a crisp cracker +Hearts of palm with jalapeno soy and mirin sauce +Palate cleaner which was a spoon with a grapefruit granita, lemon sorbet and fresh blueberry +Hot tofu in a spicy oil and asian broccoli +Veggie sushi and California rolls  Then they were cool enough to bring me a chocolate molten cake with ice cream and a sweet message =)  It was amazing (Kanye West song voice)  If you have some extra change to drop and want an amazing meal, then drop in or make a reservation.  I will be back!",

They serve little plates of bite sized sushi and Asian fusion that the chef prepared for us at his discretion, for ridiculous amounts of money. The wait staff was very attentive and helpful and had the best sense of humor.  They say stuff like \"this is baby yellowtail with miso sauce dusted with fennel pollen.\"  They know they're saying some pretentious stuff and they laughed with us about it without breaking character so to speak.  The best part is that the food was excellent.  Best sushi I've ever had.  Well presented with a genuine smile.  Fish so fresh it melted in my mouth.  For the price, the service and the fun I had tonight I'd say it was well worth the effort.  Be prepared to drop $100-300 per person + alcohol and tip.",

Last night we went back with our young adult kids and their friend. We paid about $150 person and had some truly extraordinary courses. I love their tasting menus because you can try so much and not everyone is going to love everything so in the end, it was heaven overall for our different eaters. Very attentive staff.

Presentation is not worthy of a $200 per person place. Everyone eating there was Caucausian, and there were not Japanese patrons. This has become a glorified Bennihana. Except that you will PAY PAY PAY here",

We ended up allowing the waitress and chef choose the dishes to serve us and nothing disappointed   Here are a few dishes we had (drooling as i type this): Yellowtail jalapeno sashimi black pepper Blu fin tuna with crusty artichoke wrapped around tofu seared fish with chive and ginger black cod jalapeno fried shrimp truffles filet and the red bean shaved ice with that green macha dessert.   the drinks were on point too. Service was even more on point. Everything was done very professionally and i wish i can live in that restaurant.   overall a MUST experience for your taste buds.",

Those two elements combined made it a very chaotic ambiance. We ordered $400 (overpriced) worth of food and drinks. The following are dishes I had sampled.  Spicy Miso Lotus Chips with Tuna & Scallop - The chips were crispy and not oily. The tuna was ok. The scallops were not. Something was off.  Shishito Peppers - I loved these peppers. They are full of flavor yet not spicy. I could snack on them all day.   Mushroom Soup - This tasted meaty and delicious.  Toro (Blue Fin) and Scallion Sushi Roll - I did not like this at all. The texture of the fish seemed off to me.  Sea Urchin Nigiri - The texture and flavor was ok.  Chicken Kushiyaki (Teriyaki & Anticucho) - Ok. A bit dry and overcooked.   Teriyaki Tenderloin of Beef - Good.",

The saki selections were great but you will pay dearly for them. All in all, a fair Cali/Japanese fusion dining experience. Nobu is becoming a bit dated and there are many great restaurants in L.V. to check out for better execution and price.",

    "text": "We were going to go to the Caesars palace location but opted for this location instead since we were able to make last minute reservations.   We initially came in wanting to get the omakase (nobu signature) but our server made a recommendation to pick our dishes based on what we like, what we don't like and our dietary restrictions. We opted for this option because it sounded like something that we would actually enjoy. (At this point, we haven't even received a menu to look at). This is probably where I went wrong and regretted not getting the nobu signature.   The dishes didn't really feel like they were tailored towards what I liked/preferred. There was really nothing special with the recommended dishes because many others around received the exact same dishes/courses.   There's usually seven courses, but we had to skip out on the last course and dessert. Don't get me wrong, the food was good. But for the price point, I thought I would've enjoyed my food so much more. I just didn't really care for the crispy rice and the rock shrimp tempura - it was just filler food. It probably would've been better to just order off the regular menu.   On the other hand, I did enjoy the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno and the Alaskan cod.   Also, make sure to ask for a menu if you don't get one. Definitely going to try a different location and hopefully I have a better experience with the food.",

I also got the mango and passion fruit cocktail which came with an edible flower and was so tasty.   We had about 8 different courses come out which included raw fish, sushi, cooked dishes, and things I have never heard of before. You can taste how fresh everything was and I could eat multiple plates of everything we got.   Our server was amazing. He explained every dish perfectly and made everything sound so delicious prior to even tasting the food.   For dessert we had a fruit shaved ice which was one of the most unique desserts I've ever had. We also had some sort of white chocolate mouse, again so delicious.   Such a great experience and the food was amazing!! This location is smaller than the other location in Vegas but the food is just as good.",

The Chef dished out 16 vegetarian dishes; we were really impressed. It was almost like a tasting menu, and we loved every dish! Even my husband, an otherwise picky eater who is very difficult to please, had great things to say. Our price point was at about $50 per person, but I am guessing that's because of being vegetarian and no wine/beverages.",

Both times we went on Travelzoo's 6-course tasting menu and both times felt like we got an incredible deal!  The menu in December was a bit \"heavier\" than in July.. If they offer it, we will absolutely take advantage again!  All of the dishes went together wonderfully and came out with excellent pacing, we never felt rushed or felt it was being dragged on. However, given we came on a discount, I wouldn't have been surprised if they had tried to rush us out for higher paying guests.  Both times the miso cod was the stand out and our favorite. It was presented a little bit differently each time. Both times the desert was a \"bento box\" with a chocolate lava cake and green tea ice cream - perfect 6th course, in my opinion. We don't have any allergies so I can't speak to how accommodating that would be. However, both times we went, the server did specifically ask.   The first time, our server was a bit friendlier.. Although we had good servers that were very responsive and made great cocktail recommendations both times.  We're cocktail people so both times we went, we got around $100 worth of cocktails.  But, because I bought the voucher that included two cocktails the second time we went, we only spent about $70 on cocktails in July. Great cocktails, though the cocktail menu did not change from December to July (like the tasting menu did) and all were right around $15.",

I'm saying my water glass never reached less than halfway before it was refilled. They came back often, but not too often to where it was annoying and pesky, to check on us. Our waitress recommended several plates to try and let me tell you, ALL of them were on point. The yellowtail with jalapeno (typically my favorite dish anywhere), the salmon with pear, the tenderloin tobanyaki, the Nobu house roll, the shisito peppers- all were incredible dishes! The fish was buttery and the sauces made the dishes complete. The tenderloin was PERFECTLY cooked medium rare. Genuinely one of the best meals I have had in a long time. I will definitely return when back in Las Vegas. Thank you all for a wonderful culinary experience, and for a wonderful time in celebrating my husbands birthday.",

Its interior wasn't the best and it was loud.    Nobu's signature dishes are all on the first 2 pages in the menu (mostly cold dishes on right and some hot dishes on left).  Go for these signature dishes:  Yellow Tail sashimi with jalapeo, Toro tartar with cavier, and Todari with Nobu style (Live Scallop!). The black code with miso is great but a bit on the heavy side.    These dishes are crafted so skillfully to burst your taste buds with delightful surprises.  A bit sour, oh wait... that melt in your mouth texture..., delicious.. and wait.. spicy.. no no and also fresh parsley taste too!  Oh my, how can I describe it?  And worse still, I had it all expressed on my face so it was like I was making faces.  It's hard to control.    Expect and prepare to pay, a lot.",

While Kobe beef may be hard to mess up (though certainly not impossible :P), Nobu delivers it perfectly in several different preparations. From tartar, to seared fillet, to wok fried, it's always decadent and flavorful. The sushi is ridiculously fresh and well presented, as are the salads and desserts. The staff does just an amazing job describing every ingredient in every course in great detail, explaining where everything is grown, what flavors it's chosen for, and it's history. Simply amazing.   Their Sake list is diverse and excellent, and Nobu has the best cold Sakes I've ever had. I've had the chance to have some blind horizontal tastings, and Yk-35 always wound up as being my favorite.",

Don't even get me started on the host who shouts \"welcome\" in Japanese whenever he walks someone to their table.   OK, now I feel better.  Proceed to the review:  We were told that we could only sit at our table for an hour (WTF?) and could not order the chef's tasting menu, which was basically the only thing we wanted to get , mostly because the menu was so large and complicated it made us all tired and confused to read it!  The server told us she would bring us several dishes, but not the full tasting menu.  Well, several courses, 4 beers and 2 bottles of wine later, I guess we had spent enough money to keep the table since it was waaaayyyyy past our allotted hour.   The food was pretty incredible - kumamoto oysters with caviar, wonderful fresh sashimi, tempura, rock shrimp with some type of amazing sauce.  I think my favorite dish was also the most pretentious - duck that was cooked over hot river stones and then finished off at the table with a splash of courvoseour that was then set aflame!  $750 for four and we were still hungry enough to stop off int he VIP reception area of the Bellagio on the way back and polish off the desserts they had laid out.",

At 9:45 the waiter let us know that  \"we apologize but we really need your table back.\"  I thought this was a joke.

The things that stood out for me were the rock(?) shrimp and the yellowtail sashmi. The lychee sake I got was also super yummy.   My only suggestion is that if you do go, be aware that this place is pricey. It's worth the cost for the food & service, but in my opinion ONLY if you go with a small group of no more than 4 people. We had 8 people in our party, so by the time everything went around, I probably had a total of 5 bites of food all night. For $80. That kind of sucked.",

Every food establishment should have a convenient place to wash your hands! -Uni was so--- not fresh,  It was bitter!  Though as soon as I mentioned it, the waiter took it off our bill.

Always came to clean the table between courses and keep my coffee topped off.  Price:  Surprisingly, the fixed price menu was pretty reasonable.  Given that three of us spent only $375 including 4 beers, 3 x $100 Omakasas, and extra orders of the shrimp, I thought it was very fair relative to the $250 we would have spent at any other good LV restaurant.

All I have to say, is \"Wow!\"  I'm impressed & amazed w/the chef's creation :0   $100+ per person for Omakase course (we ordered mostly sushi).  Below are some of the stuff I ate:  Red Snapper w/Shiso + Salt  (Very light & delicious) /  Halibut w/Green Onion & Ponzu-type sauce (:d) /  Ootoro (OMG, it melted in my mouth :d) /  Live Octopus + Octopus Wasabi side dish (not too spicy & light) / Trout w/ Jalapeno (nice kick of hotness; interesting) / Tobiuo + Ginger (Flying Fish; Sorta sticky...interesting) /  Squid w/Tomato Flakes (Chef said, \"The most expensive kind of Squid\" - very concise & easy way to describe the ingredient :p) /  Negi-Toro Roll (Fatty Tuna & Scallion Roll - Orthodox but good!) / Uni (Sea Urchin - so-so, actually not too great; this was my least fav) / Miso Soup (Just Ok) / Abalone + Liver (Pretty Cool) /  Kinmedai w/Sakura no Ha (Splendid Alfonsino w/a Leaf of Cherry Blossom - Awesome, my fav! Nice aroma)  Unagi w/Yuzu (Eel w/Citron - Interesting to have it non-kabayaki) / Anago (Sea Eel -Too Sweet for me :0) /  Yamaimo w/Shiso & Umeboshi (Yam w/Shiso & Japanese Pickled Plum; very sour & salty - Nice way to finish the meal! Light & Refreshing!) I don't think they used Nama-wasabi, but I didn't mind.  I know it's catered to non-Japanese, but they definitely can make a better green tea.   Other pros: Nice Decor & interior Design. No waiting time (although we came here pretty darn early; so, that may be why). I didn't really have that much issue w/ noise (like some other yelpers were saying). Great service (very attentive)!  Long story short, if you're thinking about visiting this place,  ordering some California Roll, Tuna Roll, or your regular Tuna, Salmon, & Yellowtail Sushi are waist of your money. I felt so sad to see some people next to us eating such thing & paying so much for their dinner. You can get those anywhere for a decent price w/any restaurants, unless you're going to places like Rio's Seafood Buffet (Their sushi taste nasty! Although everything else tasted good :p).   Anywa, Great Sushi*  Fish are fresh, Shari (the Rice) is nice and airy. Well worth the price. Order the Omakase :d I recommend it.",

The place is stylin', for sure - but strange in that it has a chill vibe, but in HR fashion, they yell something in japanese everytime they walk through the place to seat new customers.  I have no idea what it is - what it means -  but it's a Disneyesque feel, and it's jarring when it's at your back (as it was for us at the sushi bar).  The sushi was obviously fresh - and it's cool that you order from the sushi chef and watch them make it (remember to tip them!!) - but the taste of the rolls we ordered was fairly average.  Luckily the bill wasn't steep, but it would be on the lines of an 'easy, nothing special' kind of place back home.  Don't think that's how they view themselves.  Tao wins out, so hit HR for the vibe outside of this place.",

    "text": "One of my goals in life is to go to all the Nobus in the world! Such a special experience every time and this did not disappoint. We were celebrating my brother's and my mother's birthdays, which they happen to share. I mentioned this in the comment section when making my reservation through OpenTable but forgot I had done so as a few weeks had passed. We all ordered Omakase and enjoyed course after course of incredible dishes. When it came to dessert, they presented two very special, personalized plates with candles for the birthday people. In addition, our server also brought a special after dinner drink, on the house.    My only quibble is with service. Our main server was wonderful, as were the other \"runners\" who brought out each course. The bottom line is that it drives me nuts when plates are removed before everyone at the table is finished. In fact some are removed the instant the last bite is taken, almost in midair.  I suspect some servers are instructed to do this, so it's not their fault, but it still drives me crazy!  That being said, it didn't detract from our overall experience and many of the dishes are just unforgettable.",

    "text": "Came here last night with a group of friends because we wanted to try out the tasting menu offered on groupon.  5 courses total including dessert.  My friend and I arrived earlier than everyone else and decided to have a couple of drinks at the bar. The bartenders were extremely friendly and had great suggestions of what drinks to order. Just the way they explained the ingredients in each drink made us want to try them all. Our favorite was the Cucumber martini (Finlandia Grapefruit Vodka, Fresh Cucumber Puree, Lychee Juice, Lemon Juice). The bartender also recommended the Spicy Acai Martini (Veev Acai Spirit, Acai, Passion Fruit Puree, Serrano Peppers). After making it for another customer he gave us some to sample and it was delicious. We will definitely be back for that drink  On to the food...  Yellowtail jalapeno: fresh yellowtail and just a slight but of heat from the jalapeno. Delicious.  edamame: pretty standard edamame. Nothing to write home about  Sushi: California roll, and 3 pieces of nigiri sushi. Good fish, but not a stand out course  Rock shrimp: battered shrimp in a creamy spicy sauce.   Miso black cod: favorite dish of the night. You really can't go wrong with black cod miso and Nobu has really nailed this dish. It was tasty and melted in your mouth.   Bentobox dessert: this included homemade green tea ice cream, flour less chocolate cake, and Suntory Cappucino (Chocolate crunch, coffee cream, whiskey foam and milk ice cream). The Suntory Cappucino stole the show. There were so many flavors that went together so well and weren't too sweet. I would order this again by itself  Overall, it was worth what we paid because we were able to try out so many different favorite dishes they offered. They offer the full menu at the bar just in case you want to stop in without reservations. Give the Spicy Acai Martini a shot!",

I did my Yelp homework and scoured previous reviews, making note of the oft recommended items, and went in knowing exactly what my friend and I would order.  We ordered a gamut of different dishes: shishito peppers, edamame, wagyu beef, jalapeno yellowtail, rock shrimp tempura, lamp chop, otoro and salmon sashimi, miso black cod.   I thought I was assembling a Nobu all-star meal; what we ended up with was a mediocre and extremely overpriced meal.  For every dish that we  ordered, I could list a superior counterpart at Japonais or Sunda in Chicago for a fraction of the cost.  Also of note is the fact that our waiter initially remarked that sashimi orders came as two pieces, but when we got our bill, we noted that our four bite-sized slices of otoro came to a total of $76.  The wagyu was also incredibly overpriced for what we got; apparently each ounce is $30 or so and the minimum order is 2 ounces.    Maybe it was the sheer excellence of the previous night's meal, but we left feeling we had blown $350 on a very unsatisfactory experience.  Even at half the price, the value would be questionable.",

The place looks very nice, and the service is excellent. I'm no expert on Japanese food so there were a lot of things that I wasn't familiar with. The waiter was great at explaining everything.  I like to be adventurous from time to time with what I eat and so I ordered the chefs selection because it had so many things on it that I had never tried. Well it was excellent. Some of the flavors were a little strange, but I don't mean that in a bad way.  It definitely added to my life experience, and I am so glad that I tried this place.

    "text": "BLUF...The dining highlight of my trip to Vegas with my girlfriend was our dinner at Nobu.  This was my third trip to Nobu, each time having had the Chef's Omakase Tasting Menu.  Nobu's tasting menu is a thoughtfully composed meal served kaiseki-style (sort of a themed meal) that seeks to tie together individual dishes by attributes like taste, texture, and temperature to enhance the overall experience of the meal.  Since there isn't a set menu, you select the price point you're willing to pay and the Chef and the kitchen staff prepares an appropriate amount of courses using whatever exotic ingredients they deem fit.  We both received 9 courses with sake pairing.   First course:  We started with a Kumamoto Oyster wrapped in smoked salmon topped with a osetra caviar, served on an endive leaf in an asparagus \"boat\" with accompanied by sweet and sour miso sauces.  A masterful start!  The 5 basic tastes were tastefully and elegantly captured together in a single dish!   Second course:  Shima-aji Sashimi served in a tosazu (vinegared sardines) gelee with micro celery and \"sea grapes\" kelp...garnished with pickled turnip.  A great all-around dish, but the pickle turnip was the ingredient that put it over the top!  Third course:  Bluefin Tuna Sashimi topped with garlic puree and sliced serrano chilies with jalapeno emulsion over brown rice salsa.  I love sashimi, but the garlicky goodness and spiciness from the chilies was amazing.  The brown rice salsa was damn tasty in its own right!  Fourth course:  Ocean Trout and Seared Sweet Shrimp Sashimi salad served with mache, peppercorn, and spicy lemon dressing.   Another success!  The peppercorns gave it the spicy notes that greatly accented the raw fish.  Intermezzo:  A Yuzu Sorbet...a simple yet refreshing palate cleanser that marked the transition from cold dishes to hot.  Fifth course:  Pan-seared Seabass, seasonal mushrooms, and wild ramps served in a yuzu soy sauce.  As much as I loved the seabass, the earthy mushrooms and ramps nearly stole the show in this dish!  Sixth course:  Grilled Wagyu Beef with Seared Foie Gras served over yellow sweet corn and snap peas with soy-mirin reduction.  The oh-so-tender Australian-raised wagyu beef paired nicely with the perfectly seared foie gras.    Seventh course:  Dashi with Lobster and Enoki Mushroom with Japanese greens.  So simple, yet such an incredibly satisfying dish!  They didn't skimp on the lobster, either.  In many ways, this was my favorite dish of the night.  Eighth course:  A selection of sushi...Otoro (fatty tuna), Tasmanian Sea Trout, Sea Eel, a fish I can't recall, Mirugai (geoduck), and Tamago (egg omelet).  I love sushi.  I LOVED all of these nigiri!  Ninth course:  Shiso (?) Panna Cotta with Strawberry \"Caviar\", an understated but very satisfying closer to our meal.  The \"caviar\" was made to resemble ikura or salmon roe and was a very nice, creative touch.  As for our sake, Chris (I think that was his name), our lead server, informed us that Nobu imports its sake from Japan and that it's made especially for Nobu.  I'm not an expert, at all, on the finer aspects of sake.  Suffice it to say, our pairings were very nice, with subtle, yet interesting differences between each glass and went well with each dish.  Chris did a great job all-around job taking care of us.  We had a very leisurely meal, never feeling rushed, but we never had to wait for our next course or glass of sake.  The timing was impeccable!  I'm really not the type of person to toss out superlatives casually, but our meal was arguably one of the best meals I've ever had...at least since I've started yelping!  Each dish was memorable and no single dish clearly stood out as the best since they were all outstanding!  It takes a lot of hair-splitting to even pick a dish that was less satisfying that the rest but if I had to pick one, it was the wagyu and foie gras course...and that was only due to the impression that the accompaniments on other dishes were more exciting than the sweet corn and snap peas.  If you're in Vegas for one night and can only eat at one place while you're there, go to Nobu and have the Omakase Tasting Menu!  You won't regret it!",

After dinner, we wandered through the Hard Rock Hotel checking out the varioous rock legend exhibits, wondering how the fuck it was that a drummer with one arm (Def Leppard) got his drum set in the Hard Rock, and mine got sold to some pre-pubescent fucker at a garage sale for a hundred bucks. Fucking hell.  Nobu's has the best fish on earth. Best pineapple martini's too. None of the fish smells like cooch either, unlike the sushi shithole I go to in Phoenix.  Double bonus.",

BUT I decided to give this another try in Vegas and man am I glad I did!!  We were a group of 4 and quite hungry. Kind of a bad mix as you're walking into a notoriously expensive japanese/sushi resto. Now if you're going to dine here this is how you do it.  Don't waste your time ordering a la carte. Give your knowledgeable server a maximum $ amount per head and let him design the menu for you. We were ready to shell out a bit and spend about $100 each excluding alcohol which in the end was the perfect amount to leave completely satisfied. You can tell him a few things for direction (like we had to have the miso cod!) but let him bring out dish after mind blowing dish and you just sit back and enjoy your company. They carefully explain everything that is brought out and whats great is because you are eating the exact same things you get to share in the same experience.   We also ordered a 60 ounce bottle of Sake and ordering drinks was also something we didn't have to think about for the rest of the night. Our glasses were constantly refilled until the end of our meal and it actually was the perfect amount of drinks for the entire meal which lasted about 2 hours in total....  I can't say we had one thing that wasn't absolutely delicious and unique!  Highly recommend!",

Our waiter gave us honest recommendations, paired our foods with sake, and didn't even include gratuity on our party of 9.  Obviously we tipped him big time for all his work.  All the rolls were all amazing.  The Black Cod Miso appetizer was money.  I can't think of a single negative thing about this restaurant.

Eaten here at the Hard Rock location a dozen times now and every meal has been outstanding from service, to drinks to food and atmosphere! We always get the \"must have\" dishes like the Yellow Tail Sashimi with Jalapeno, the Wagyu Beef MiniTacos and the signature dish: Miso Cod. There is nothing like it, honestly. But apart from that, we have always trusted our server and just tell them to recommend small plates and keep them coming until we have had enough. The bill is usually pretty high, but it is THE meal we have to have when in Vegas! Going to try the one in Caesar's on our next trip.",

    "text": "First off...service is awesome!! That's the best thing about this place. The food is so medium. It's super Americanized Japanese food that has some modern cooking elements added to it, but nothing that elevates the food enough for the price. We went on a Travelzoo special deal, $95 for 7 courses for two people. If we had to spend the normal price, I would've been angry for sure. At least I get to cross this off of my restaurant bucket list.   The courses... - Edamame: regular cold edamame with chunky kosher salt. Nothing special! I make yuzu citrus salt edamame that would give this place a run for it's money.  - Salmon carpaccio and vegetable spring rolls: the salmon is covered in some mustard sauce that takes away from the salmon taste, and frankly, the salmon quality is not that great. It's the same quality as any run of the mill sushi joint that serves American rolls in OC. The vegetable spring roll in the center was kinda nice for the freshness and crunchy aspects.  - Sushi course: comes with a caterpillar roll and 3 fish types of sushi. C'MON!!! A CATERPILLAR ROLL? You can't even tell it's a caterpillar roll because the eel taste is too absent. Tastes like a rice roll covered in eel sauce. The quality of the fish for the Nigiris was again not as fresh as I would expect for this caliber of a restaurant. I don't know who picks the fish or the fish monger, but they need to do better. I forget the 3 types of fish now, but one did come with a perilla leaf nestled between the rice and fish. I liked that element added, the fish itself was covered in a citrus and salt, which is my favorite flavor profile for sushi. The others were covered in a sweet soy or something. I can't remember very well, because it was all very unmemorable.  - Miso black cod: the quality of the fish is spectacular in some parts and super dried in others. This fish dish is good, but I would say a bit too overly sweet. This was my fav dish of all the courses, but it's not enough to make me wanna come back ever. This dish wasn't executed 100% perfectly.  - Ribeye course: the meat is cooked to a super tender texture since it's braised for a while, but the sauce it's braised in is again sweet. There was a weird lemongrass taste somewhere in the dish that didn't belong. The heart of palm done two ways - pureed and fried - both did nothing for me. The fried ones tasted just like oil and no distinct flavor. The puree was mush and added no value to the dish either. I guess it's a rice substitute, but it's a poor sub for it.  - Mushroom soup: tastes like mushroom water with smoke added. The mushrooms in it are the stem of king oyster mushroom, maitake mushroom which is also called hen-of-the-wood, and one shiitake. I recognize all the mushrooms immediately since I cook with all these myself often. I'm not sure how they get the smoke taste, I'm guessing they cold smoke the mushrooms before adding it to simmering water. Could use salt or dashi or something else to take it to the next level.  - Dessert: 3 fried bland balls. The black sesame ice cream is good though!   Don't waste your time, money, or stomach space for this place. Would've put one star except for the service that night was really nice. I think Nobu needs to let me cook him or take him around for some real Japanese dishes with soul.",

    "text": "It's my birthday and I figured I would treat myself to World Famous Nobu.   I asked to sit at the bar. Out of numerous seats open along the bar, the server decides to sit me at probably the worst seat in the entire restaurant...right next to the servers entrance. Ugh! Servers standing outside staring at me eat, constantly people walking behind me, can hear conversations of servers standing inside. No bueno.  Next, the price. Oh wow. Triple the price of the place I went just the other day in marina del Rey and I guarantee it's more fresh. This fish tasted frozen and thawed. Absolutely unacceptable if you are charging 25-30 for a single roll.   I guess I had my personall chef but the guy could hardly speak and I'm sorry, I'm the customer. I'm not going to force myself to speak Spanish. The chef and the server were disagreeing on ingredients, too. That's a bad sign.   No one seemed to have any personality. Everyone is so rushed to get things out, I would rather them take their time and get it right then to rush a 60 dollar meal. But, for some reason there's 9 chefs right in front of me with time to look and stare at me when I eat. Ugh ugh ugh.   I could go on but there's just too much.  Really disappointed.",

It really wasn't too busy, but we sat at the bar. The bar tender was really helpful and talked me through a lot of the menu items.   I started with the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno. Perfect start to the meal! The fish was so fresh. Next I had the Lobster ceviche. It's served on a bed of lettuce. I was debating between that or the crab and the bar tender really pushed the lobster, but it was just ok to me. I feel like there was almost too much going on. My friend ordered the Rock Shrimp Tempura and I ended up eating a good amount of that. It's way better than my second dish.  I closed with a soft shell crab roll. The roll was delicious!!! However, I feel like next time, I might get it as a hand roll instead of a cut roll. I feel like you don't get the full soft shell crab experience if you just cut it up and throw it in a roll like that.",

The restaurant wasn't even half full so apparently everyone else already got the memo not to come here anymore.  Sidenote:  I'd been here before as well as to two other Nobu locations, which is also part of the huge disappointment.  The sushi portions were tiny.  The rock shrimp was delicious, especially when eaten with the greens (although the server should have told the table to do this since it wasn't obvious to my group so I had to inform them).  The spicy tuna on crispy rice was a terrible presentation.  The yellowtail jalapeno sashimi was beautiful but boring.  Same for the tiny sushi portions we received.  Miso cod was still excellent.  But the price considering the portions is just offensive.  All in all, not a great experience and I expect so much more from Nobu.  Perhaps there's a reason we couldn't get into the Caesars location that night.  Bottom line:  don't come to this Nobu.",

Sashimi and Sashimi Salad: The fish here is generously cut.  They're fresh and the sauces they come with accent the fish. 5/5  Shrimp with Spicy Garlic Sauce: If you like garlic and a little bit of spiciness - this is the dish for you.  The garlic sauce was amazing. The dish comes with some mushrooms. 5/5  Tenderloin of Beef Toban Yaki: Came in a sizzling plate. A piece of very tender and juicy steak with enoki mushrooms and asparagus. Simple but delightful dish. 5/5  Nobu's House Special: Salmon, tuna, hamachi, avocado and crab meat  wrapped in nori and daikon, sprinkled with masago. Each of the 6 pieces are not-so-bite-sized. 4/5  Salmon Skin Handroll: Salmon skin with just a very thin layer of salmon meat making each piece so crispy and delicious. That's all that matters in a salmon skin handroll. 5/5  Kulfi: Chocolate pistachio frozen custard, Nobu cabernet cherries, candied pistachios, chocolate feulletine.  Great textures: crispy and creamy. 5/5  Bento Box: Flourless chocolate cake, white chocolate sauce, shiso syrup and green tea ice cream. I'm not sure why it's called a bento box since it definitely doesn't come in one. It was free and yummy. 4/5",

If you like a little heat I recommend the peppers as an app--every 7th pepper as a kick. You never know what you are going to get and they are delicious.

Every dish was described in detail when it was brought out. water was ALWAYS refilled quickly, as was my tea. plates were frequently exchanged and finished items quickly removed! Wonderful suggestions from our main waiter.   Love the yellow tail with jalapeno the bed. the cod with lettuce wrap was a little on the sweet side for me. spicy tuna wasn't really spicy enough. I couldn't really tell if the sashimi or sushi was fresh because all the dishes were overpowered by the sauce--but most of the sauces were good. popcorn chicken also very tasty. all in all, great dining experience but properly would not go out of my way to come here--pretty pricey.",

    "text": "This is a very trendy dining option for Japanese food. It is pricey, as all trendy restaurants with famous chefs are...but it is worth a visit simply because of Nobu himself.  The menu options are plentiful, but the food is served tapas style, with small plates and not much on them. However, the food is flavorful and always fresh.  Make sure to ask the server for the more popular items. You honestly cannot go wrong with any of them. The sake is also good and worth  the few extra dollars on your bill.   Don't expect to be full though when you walk out of the restaurant...unless you spend a jackpot sized amount. This is a great place to start your meal...but if it's the only thing you eat all night, you may find yourself a bit tipsy if your next stop is a local club!!!",

Our party of five were here back in late September, but the yellowtail sashimi + jalapeno, rock shrimp tempura, mixed seafood ceviche, and tiradito still bring very happy memories.  It has a hint of that SNL-Jeffrey's vibe that makes me a little queasy.  Nonetheless, after several small dishes with a round of alcohol shared among five friends, it was actually a very reasonable price for fine dining on the Strip.  I get a kick out of the waiter who rescues your napkin whenever you leave your table.  He's got eyes like a hawk!",

So I don't really get to Vegas much.    But one thing that is really cool about Vegas is that it has become ground zero for the biggest collection of some of the most amazing restaurants in - dare I say - the world.    Just about every great chef/restaurateur in the US and some from elsewhere have set up shop in Las Vegas.  It is too cool, and is what is going to bring me back to Vegas before too long.    Which brings me to Nobu, the worldwide chain of really great Japanese restaurants.    It was way too loud and way too crowded, but I had some of the most amazing food there Friday night.  I am still dreaming about the incredible mushroom salad, with like 10 different kinds of mushrooms, and the \"live\" scallops, the miso cod and the excellent spicy tempura rock shrimp.    And the Chablis we ordered - I wish I could remember the name - was outstanding.    Truly a great meal, with some great company.   I could easily see coming back here, but with so many other great places to try in Vegas, I probably won't for quite a while.",

The service was incredibly fast (3 people from our group were late and we completely finished our meal by the time they arrived,) and the food was fabulous. The flavors were crisp, unique, and every bite of food was like an explosion in my mouth. Since we shared all the dishes we ordered, that pretty much means that we only got one bite so we savored it for all that it was worth. Damn you Nobu for being so expensive! Otherwise I would have ordered 2 of everything!  A couple of dishes I would recommend trying are: -yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno -toro tartar with caviar -black cod with miso -rock shrimp tempura -new zealand mussels with the garlic sauce  ***The MUST try dish is the FISH/LOBSTER TACOS!!!*** They are not on the menu here, but you can special order them and they are AWESOME.

One time the service was horrific and when we complained the server goose-egged his own tip on the credit card slip (party of 10, $1,700 tab and we were gonna just give him 15% but decided to roll with his suggestion).    As for the food it's 40-50% the quality of their NYC counterpart - and that's generous.  Don't get me wrong I have all the respect in the world for Chef Matsuhisa, but I guess that's what happens when you open a restaurant 3,000 miles away with a dining area the size of a football field.  Some dishes oversauced, others overcooked.  No love, man, no love.  If you want Nobu style food for half the price take a trip off strip to Sen of Japan.  If you're looking for high-end sushi on the strip Okada at the Wynn's the best I've had but I've yet to dine at Yellowtail (Bellagio) and friends tell me that's the best.

    "text": "I really wanted to try Nobu after having an amazing experience at Morimoto in Philly.  I was not disappointed.  We arrived promptly at our reservation time and were seated immediately.  Upon being seated we were greeted by our server within moments.    The atmosphere at Nobu is much different than Morimoto...Nobu is more lively and trendy.    They have you order a few dishes from the three parts of their menu.  We started with the oysters and the lobster ceviche which is served in lettuce wraps.  The lettuce wraps were quite good and the oysters were very earthy tasting.   For our second course we chose the creamy spicy crab and the rock shrimp tempura in butter ponzu.  The creamy spicy crab may be one of the best dishes I've ever tasted in a restaurant.  At the end of our weekend I asked my brother in law what his favorite thing was about Vegas and he responded without hesitation \"Eating creamy spicy crab at Nobu.\"  Not the club, not winning $300, not seeing old friends....the creamy spicy crab.    We chose 4 sushi rolls for our main course, the house roll which is like a rainbow row except the fish on the inside, a spider roll, unagi avocado (not on the menu but they happily prepared it for us) and yellowtail scallion.  Each of the rolls was well prepared and the fish was fresh.  For dessert we ordered assorted mochi, which caused brother in law to wet himself for the second time that night.  Our assortment included tiramisu, pistachio, honeydew, and raspberry.   All were amazing.  The service was outstanding throughout the night.  The meal was well paced, it wasn't the lingering three hour affair we had at Morimoto but we didn't feel rushed at any point.  In the end I felt that the bill was actually fairly reasonable for what we ordered.  Including tip and alcohol it came to about $90 a person.  I do have to add that it did bother me slightly to find that some of the customers were wearing sneakers, open toe sandals (on men) and collarless shirts.  When I made our reservation they informed me that the dress code did not include these things, which is totally fine.  I'm all for getting dressed up to go out to eat, especially in Vegas, and especially at a place like Nobu, but I do not like it when I go through the effort and others don't have to.",

I wanted to hate it, being so trendy and all, but the fact is...I loved it!  My partners wife knew one of the chefs cousin who works in Los Angeles,  and he came out to greet the table.  He asked what we were looking for and we told him...just give us your best \"Omakase\" style meal.  I don't know if the fact that we knew his cousin influenced the food or not but the whole experience was awesome.    Just a few of the memorable items were:  1. Shishito peppers, fried and delicious- I had never even heard of these before...where have I been. 2. a plethora of Sashimi plates with various spices and sauces, especially the red snapper. 3. Kobe beef on hot rocks, beef is served raw on sizzling rocks and you cook it yourself at your table.  When I go for sushi, I usually go alone or with one other person.  I sit at the bar and make sure the chef serves me what he recommends.  I don't want sauces,  I want perfect fish.  Normally I don't go for this fusion stuff.    I have to say the fish was great and the fusion was a nice change of pace.  I do live near Malibu, and I have never been to the Malibu Nobu.  Maybe I will give it a try.

I also liked how the soft shell crab roll was prepared with tobiko, avocado and a thin layer of daikon wrapping the outside of the roll.  The only thing I didn't like was the kelp salad (weird crunchy texture and sour flavor), but they let me exchange it for the field greens salad instead (just ok).

    "text": "Impromptu trip to Vegas for my best friend's birthday! Yay! While planning our trip, I noticed a Groupon for Nobu. I'd been wanting to try out one of the LA locations for a while, so this seemed like a win-win. Overall, the experience was pretty great. The service was friendly and very attentive (almost too attentive... my ice tea cup was never empty. i don't think they even let it get half empty...)  The meal started with edamame which wasn't anything special. Standard at any Japanese place you'd go to. The first course was the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalepeno. This was so good!! I'm normally not a jalepeno fan, but it had just the right amount of kick to it. This was definitely my favorite dish of the night.  Next up was the Rock Shrimp Tempura. This was alright. I liked the sauce with the lettuce/salad below, but it was too heavy for the shrimp... My friend and I agreed that it just left us craving honey walnut shrimp from Panda Express.   Third entree up was the Black Cod Miso. This was also an outstanding dish, like the yellowtail. The fish was cooked perfectly and the entire dish was both presented well and tasted great.   The fourth entree (and the reason for docking one star) was California Roll and assorted Nigiri. Maybe it's just because I live in LA and I'm spoiled by great sushi, but I wasn't impressed. The fish was fresh enough, but definitely not up to par to say, Sugarfish. And at the heart of it all, Nobu is a Japanese restaurant, so I expected their sushi to be on par with their fusion dishes. Sadly, not the case.  The meal ended with the Bento Box dessert, which had flour-less chocolate cake, green tea ice cream and some cappuccino thing. I'm not a huge dessert person but it was ok. I've never disliked any green tea ice cream I've had and the cappuccino thing was unique.   Overall, it was a great meal and good experience. Without a doubt, it was worth the price of the Groupon. Not sure about full price though. I think only the Yellowtail sashimi and black cod miso would be worth it.",

    "text": "I've been to this location once before, as well as the locations in NYC and San Diego, but I came back to Vegas for the July 4th weekend and came here with a group of friends.  I was looking forward to it because Nobu is one of my favorite restaurants, but it was just our luck that the A/C at the Hard Rock Hotel was broken so it was hot and stuffy inside the whole hotel and restaurant... and then the gas broke so we weren't able to order hot dishes.  Our cold dishes were good, especially the yellowtail sashimi. (my favorite dish there)  We ordered a sushi and sashimi platter, but you can get good sushi and sashimi at most other places.  They offered us free shots of pineapple and mango cocktail, and the service was good for the most part, until they started cleaning our table and spilled water all over my boyfriend.  I would come back to this restaurant, but I will probably opt for the NYC or Miami location next.",

Go for it while you are there.... try the items you have not seen or heard of and you will be knocked back in your seat.  Chef Nobu Matsuhisa and his staff know their way around design and execution at the sushi bar.  World class as far as we are concerned second only to Sensei in Kihei, Maui.  P.S. We were so excited to try Nobu's in Los Angeles that we brought friends...ouch! What a disappointment.  The sushi was so-so and the service blew major league chunks.",

What I thought was a lame attempt to up-sell me the first time on the 'house specialties' was really a mistake and lack of trust on my part.  Get the house specialties like the Miso Cod and other dishes.  They are really amazing.  That and the sashimi is delicious with some less common choices.  I really would steer clear of the rolls...you can get those anywhere and to be honest, rolls are for the casual sushi eater.    Thanks for proving me wrong Nobu.  You made me eat cod (I mean crow) and I enjoyed every minute of it!",

    "text": "We came here New Years Eve to celebrate!  The service was outstanding! more attentive than NOBU in Japan which I had a pleasure of experiencing on a work trip last month. Thank you (  ) so much Adrienne. The Ambiance is great, dim lighting lighting makes for a very romantic evening for diners. You might get louder or more obnoxious dining group sitting perhaps close by which can negatively impact the atmosphere, but no way to really control that and after all we are in VEGAS! We could not decide what we wanted to eat and decided to just set a budget per person and let the server bring us whatever her wonderful self thought would wow us.(Adrienne DID AMAZING!!!)  1. Edamame / Shishito Peppers: I rarely eat shishito peppers but these were fantastic! not hot ( guess I got lucky since I can't deal with HOT ) and a little sweet with the sauce. Edamame? its Edamame.......  2. Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno and Cilantro The Cilantro on with each piece was interesting but complimented the flavors greatly. I really enjoyed this and would order this again next time.  3.Live Scallop: Thinly sliced scallop served in the tiradito-style with peruvian flavors of cilantro, spice and Japanese fusion elements. The abductor is also thinly sliced on the plate, giving contrasting flavor and texture. Although good I enjoyed the Yellowtail more than this dish. On a side note... Did someone spill the Yuzu on this dish? little overwhelming....  4. Black Cod Miso in Lettuce Butter Cups: This was one of my favorite dishes of the night ( Dessert got the number one spot sorry). This is a must eat dish and I will return to experience this one again! mmm my mouth is watering for this one right now. I would suggest to tone down the sugar.  5. Kurobuta Pork Belly Skewers and Chicken wings:  The pork was also one of my favorite things the whole night but at that time I haven't had any dessert yet. Amazing Kurobuta Pork Belly that was braised to absolutely melt-in-your-mouth perfection, although a little fatty, but people tend to enjoy the fat so I can't complain.   6. Toro Blue Fin and Salmon which was actually two dishes. I really enjoyed the Toro more than the salmon maybe due to the fact I dislike salmon in raw form. I believe both of these dishes were so so, I rather eat the fish plain. Although to give it justice each piece had amazing flavor with different textures from the fish, capers,wasabi and garlic chips.  7: King Crab with brown sugar? and cherry tomatoes and shiso leaf:  Truthfully I would not order this dish If I were to come back due to the fact I can go to many Vegas buffets and devour crab legs for hours. This was nothing to write home about.   8. Sushi Platter with California Roll, Uni that was so fresh I could eat it everyday, Yakitori Unagi, And Salmon. Everything was great except the rice... this was a let down... it was hard and dry. I am surprised at the sushi chef for making nigiri with this rice.  9. Tenderloin of Beef Toban Yaki: This dish was great but after eating a ton of wagyu in Japan your palette gets you and you end up craving that melt in your mouth amazingness you just don't have with any other type of beef. Maybe just stick with the Uni! haha......  10. Beef Carpaccio: What can I say? this is as good as it gets people! eat it! enjoy it! Although if you are looking for good Beef Carpaccio District One on Spring Mountain and Jones has some killer Carpaccio.  11. Fried Rock Shrimp something something something: Well it was shrimp... it was very well presented and came to the table in a rock pot still sizzling. Lets just go to Hot N' Juicy Crawfish.   12. Assortment of Desserts:   The desserts just kept coming, honestly this was what I came here for and If it wasn't for my brother and friend I would of just ordered every single dessert item on the menu and that would of been it. 4 courses of desserts after all the entrees had finished. The highlights included a cucumber shaved ice to die for with Yuzu syrup which they pour on the ice at your table with fresh berries, young coconut and cantaloupe sorbet did I mention it had STAR FRUIT ON TOP!!! I haven't had starfruit since I was a child living in Hawaii. Second was a Special New Years Eve only Sizzle in your mouth palette zapping of amazingness dessert it was Fuji Apple and champagne semifreddo (what word was that?) with apple cake crumble with POP ROCKS, yes I fucking said that right!!!! It had pop rocks in the cake crumble what dessert have you ever had with pop rocks plain genius! that's not it! It also had freeze dried kiwi and pineapples with dulce glaze finished with champagne foam and apple chips. They really should keep that one on the menu. Third was Pear Toban w/ gingerbread stout cake w/ poached pears in orange syrup w/ toasted cinnamon ice cream and candied black walnuts, this one was a warm \"homey\" dessert but not the highlight it was presented very well on a clay looking pot wit",

    "text": "Not worth the hype.   Nobu isn't a Japanese restaurant, it's a new age sushi restaurant. They may have borrowed their name from New York, but that's about where the similarities end.   Service was friendly, but brisk. They clearly wanted to get us in and out of there since we were sitting at the bar.   We ordered miso soup, the four kelp salad (their version of a seaweed salad), tamago, the Chilean sea bass with a dried miso sauce, and chicken teriyaki. The miso was standard, and the tamago was much larger than what I'm used to, but both were good. Kelp salad was a little too fishy for me, but then again, I had my heart set on seaweed salad. Both the Chilean sea bass and the chicken teriyaki were merely good, but not good enough for the ticket ($45 and $30 respectively) and neither came with rice.  So why the three stars? We just weren't overwhelmed. Nobu wasn't an impressive dining experience, and in this town, if you don't have experience, why bother?",

    "text": "Nobu should add three letters to the end of its name: E-N-O.    The food here tastes better than McDonald's but worse than Chipotle, but I would rate McDonald's higher due to it being a better value.  We had the tasting menu and some sushi.  The Yellowtail with Jalapeno, along with every other cold dish, followed the same formula: raw fish + cilantro hidden underneath a pile of salt. The Black Cod with Miso and the Beef Tenderloin tasted like bad halloween candy.  Everything was either drenched in salt or drenched in sugar, or both.  The sushi was not inedible, it was on par with the kind of sushi you can get from any two-dollar-sign sushi restaurant.  It's pretty hard to mess up sushi to the extent that they messed up their other dishes, since chefs have less artistic license when it comes to sushi.  Then again, it's hard to mess up miso soup and theirs was the worst I've ever had (way too salty).  Service was good.    Our bill, including tip, came out to nearly $600 for three people.  So if you want to trick your non-asian friends into believing that their palates lack the sophistication to appreciate expensive asian cuisine, Nobu is the place to go.  Or sometimes when you're feeling masochistic, you just want to get punched in the face.  That's when you go to Nobu.    There are many reasons to go to Nobu, but edible food is not among them.  If you want good food, there are some great French options in the area, such as Le Cirque.",

    "text": "Nirvana - pure nirvana. My taste buds were happy, I was very happy.   My BF too me here (my first trip) for our Saturday Night Dinner. We knew when we walked in that we were having the Omakase. I truly cannot pick out one single dish that I liked over the others - every single one was executed perfectly. Our waiter was kind enough to write down what we had so we could remember. Though he didn't write down the sake pairings we had - every single one of them matched perfectly with the dish. My only sadness with the sake is that I can't buy it anywhere since it is made for Nobu (perhaps time to sale it at the restaurant???)   Course 1: Kumomoto Oysters, wrapped in smoked salmon with osetra caviar, served with endive and asparagus in sweet and spicy miso sauces (sweet AND spicy? Oysters? What is not to love?)   Course 2: Shima Aji Sashimi served in tosazu gelee with micro celery and sea grapes kelp; garnished with pickled turnip (I'm not normally a turnip fan, but you could serve this to me anytime!)   Course 3: Bluefin tuna sashimi topped with garlic puree and sliced jalapeno, served with jalapeno emulsion over brown rice salsa (okay a truly unique dish - and it was spicy! You know I like spice in my life!)   Course 4: Tasmanian trout trout and seared sweet shrimp sashimi salad served with mache, peppercorn, and spicy lemon dressing. (this fish was so succulent, buttery and full of flavor - if only I could find this in DC)   Course 5: Pan seared seagrass, seasonal mushrooms, wild ramps, served in yuzu soy sauce   Course 6: Grilled washu beef with eared foie gras, served over yellow sweet corn and snap peas with soy-mirin reduction   Course 7: Soup with huge chunks of lobster (yup - HUGE); Loved the little enoki mushrooms in it!   Course 8: Sushi: One standout for me - salt water eel with this leaf that kinda tasted like basil and lemon together. Wow - yummy (this from the girl who wouldn't eat eel for a long time). Not that the other offerings weren't good.   Course 9: Dessert. Panna Cotta (I think) with strawberry caviar - the caviar was AWESOME!   Final: Three types of fruit sake. My favorite was the ginger.   I have to say this was one of the highlights of our trip. Thoroughly enjoyed the meal and would gladly go again and again.",

Only three stars for me because it cost me $150 after one beer and splitting some sake four ways. The food was kinda heavy, so I felt very bloated after.

    "text": "I adore Nobu! I go there every time I'm in Vegas!  It is pricey, I spent $300 for dinner for two this past trip.....but it is sooooo worth it.   My picks:  -Hamachi w/ jalapenos -\"live\" octopus -Tiradito \"live\" scallop -Black cod with miso -kobe beef (try tataki style) -Bento box (chocolate cake with green tea ice cream)  Though honestly, I've never had anything bad there. And try the Nobu brand beer (made exclusively for them), I'm not a big beer drinker but it pairs really, really well with the food.   The waiters are always excellent. They know the entire menu, so feel free to ask them for recommendations.   If you have to pick one nice, expensive dinner in Vegas.....definitely pick Nobu.",

    "text": "Okay. Amazing. Got Omakase, but not just Omakase....  Debated going here since we're vegans... thought I MIGHT have fish for the first time in over 4 years then decided against it and canceled our reservations. But then the night we stayed IN the Hard Rock Hotel and walked by the joint?.... well.... here's how it went down:  We stopped to just check out the menu to see what veg options were even available. The hostess and host were wondering what we were contemplating and why... We told them that we were veg and everyone at the hostess station said 'No Problem!! Come in, vegetarians here all the time!!'... but then we followed that up with 'Well, we're actually vegans.....' to which one waiter said 'Let me check with the chef, I'll be right back.'   Apparently the kitchen 'wanted the challenge'.... so in we went!  Sat down and decided to order the omakase meal. Usually this consists of six plates plus dessert but we actually got EIGHT and TWO desserts (one each, two different desserts)... Can I say AMAZING?! The food that the kitchen came up with was AMAZING. We actually were stuffed by the time the sixth course of food came around (and we thought last!) but TWO more came. By the time dessert was served we didn't think we could fit anymore into our stomachs. But we \"managed\" :)  Food, service, everything was impeccable. Def would highly recommend a visit. Worth every penny!! Very impressed with what they came up with for us as well.",

I am not picky, however and every thing sounded amazing so we just asked the waiter to bring us different items until we were full. Truly the best meal ever! Great wait staff, delicious depth of flavors, great sake... I might move in and just sleep in the booth. We even ordered a small side of rice \"or I'm going to end up licking this delicious sauce out of the bottom of this bowl...\" And the waiter laughed at my bad jokes! Winning! The only downside was the mediocre wine selection and supercalifragilistic expensive sake... But the cheapest bottle (65) was unfiltered creamy deliciousness!",

The fish is great, no doubt about that. The nigiri definitely has an elegant touch added which is quite graceful for sushi.  But I didn't like the feel of this place. Then again, this was Vegas so what do you expect? The people weren't mean like some have mentioned (maybe if you come in flipflops and mom jeans that might be the case but no one dresses like that in Vegas) but I just wasn't diggin the vibe all the much.  Nonetheless, the fish still stands as superior to most places, no doubt about that.",

    "text": "Amazing sushi. Sure for three people it was $300 dollars including tip but my son swears he's never had anything better. The drinks are top of the line and very reasonably priced. Mention a birthday and they bring out a nice little cake for the celebrant   They are not open for lunch and I recommend dinner reservations on weekends but midweek you probably won't have a long wait. I made reservations to be safe but they didn't look crowded enough for them to be warranted.  (I'm in a back brace so even a short wait feels like an eternity to me now.)  If you're adventurous I'd suggest letting them design your meal. My son chose this option and was not disappointed. My pictures are of his plates. The miso was the best I've ever tasted. Granted it's hard to mess up broth but whatever they put in it made it significantly above par.   It's one of those places where you can't just read the menu rather you have to \"discuss it.\" I feel terrible that I cannot remember our servers name but he was great. If management reads this and would like to figure out who it was they can ask the staff which young man had this conversation on March 26th around 730p....  Server: I'm very gullible.  Me: Did you know that's not in the dictionary.  Server: What's not? Me: Gullible, it's not in the dictionary.  Server: WOW I'm always learning something new.  Pause for dramatic effect while he realizes.  My mother: She's teasing you, of course it's in the dictionary.  Server: See, I told you I was gullible.   This down to earth interaction was the best part of our visit to Vegas that didn't involve murder or magic. (CSI Experience and Masters of Illusion).  Also, if they still can't remember us mention the lady with the cool walker that folds in half because they stored it for us while we ate. I made a joke that they were holding me hostage until our bill was paid because I couldn't get away without my walker.   My comparison is based off of many dinners at high end places like Top of the Hub in Boston and Gordon Ramsey's London to give you an idea of my base line for excellent food. You will drop a pretty penny if you go all out here but this is one place that is well worth it. We visit Vegas annually, usually hitting new places each year but Nobu and HRH are definitely worth coming back to.

Perhaps their training has changed, but the service was poor.   The person we think was our lead server took about 7 minutes before greeting us by saying, \"Are you ready?\" We were taken aback and clarified if he was our server, since nobody had come by except the water guy, and he glibly said, \"one of them,\" and kept his pencil poised to take our order. He offered no suggestions, no pleasantries, seemed annoyed we hadn't yet found the hot tea selections on the menu and had to point out the location. And by that, we mean pointed at what we were initially told was the wine list.  After taking our order we saw him only once more. Meanwhile our water glasses and hot tea pot remained empty beginning about halfway through the meal. We would have ordered more food, but nobody returned to ask us about more food. At one time we needed a fork and had nobody to get it. One of the party became so annoyed she obtained the check from the hostess so we could leave and let them know what a disappointing experience we had had. She was kind and apologetic, and said she'd notify the manager. Somebody returned our check to us (maybe the manager?) but didn't make any mention about our concerns or asked us about our experience. Actually, he didn't say a word or even make eye contact.  Overall highly disappointing. We will not be returning.",

    "text": "Full disclosure: My bf and I agreed we have a heavy preference for the lighter, citrusy flavors at Nobu, so my review will be in favor of those flavors.   - Yellowtail with jalapeno roll - 5.  We just prefer it with the rice but it's every bit as good as the sashimi version. Star of the night. I'd have no problem ordering two of these. I've never had it better anywhere. Ugh, my mouth is watering!! - King Crab Tacos - 5. Will get this every time. The aioli and the citrus and aaaahhh.  It had a different taco shell than the Caesar's location - the taco shell wasn't quite as good but it's thinner so you got a whole ton more crab! We also had tried the spicy tuna and lobster at Caesar's last time, and the crab outshone them! - Spicy Tuna Roll - 5. Simple and perfect. I'd order more simple rolls based on how good this one is.  - Salmon Skin Roll - 4. Huge and filling. Took me forever to chew but every chew was more flavor.  - Chef's Special Roll - 3. Too salty and not memorable. A plus is that it's really big and will fill up your stomach if you're hungry but even then, get other stuff.  - Black Cod with Miso - 4. I'd have preferred to get it with the lettuce.  It was good, but almost too salty.  But really really fatty and amazing.  - King Crab with Browned Butter - really good, but the problem with King Crab is that it's already good and this was only slightly better than steaming it at home.  The crab in the tacos is more amazing.  - Fig Confit Donuts - 4.5 so good, no alcohol.  - Barley Coconut Parfait - 5. I loved the barley ice cream omg  - Mochi - 5.  As perfect as Mochi gets.   AND we got outta there for around $250! It was kinda crazy.   We already made a list for next time, which will favor more of the citrusy flavors as well as trying dishes to recommend for my in-laws who don't like raw fish.  Nobu really shines at simple flavors and complex flavors.  It's the only sushi we want to eat anymore.",

    "text": "Service was outstanding. Water was constantly getting refilled. Food came out fast and dirty dishes removed quickly. Apparently due to Japanese upper management, everything is fast and efficient. This is what you expect from a high-star, high-priced restaurant but it always baffles me that many of the fancy restaurants I've gone to on the strip provide poor service. Nobu trains their staff well. I struck up a convo with the guy whose only job it seemed was to bring us a fresh plate every time we finished a course and he said he had to go through 3 months of training to get that job and he had been a server before at several restaurants on the strip. As far as the food, it was of great quality but portions a bit small. We had the \"6-course sampler\" deal from TravelZoo (much like a Groupon) and 6 course sounds like a lot of food but the key word was \"sampler\". Most of the dishes were pretty small and they were to be split between 2 people. So we left not feeling full (and no take-home for a nice  snack the next day) but food was different and very tasty. I am not a big fan of fish (my friend is) and I was pleasantly surprised that most of the dishes did not have a strong fish taste so I was able to eat them, and enjoy it. There were no choices in the 6-courses except dessert, choice between two. The voucher cost $125 and with 2 drinks, tax (on full amount  and tip it still came to about $200 for 2 people so not a great deal but Nobu is known for being very expensive. If you are not in to high quality fish and presentation then there are a lot of other sushi and Japanese food choices in Vegas that are less $$ and more food. Also, the decor is pretty old at the Nobu in Hard Rock and since I think the Virgin Airlines guy bought the Hard Rock Casino (2019) and is going to renovate the whole thing they are not putting any money in to it but surprised to see an old wooden floor like you would expect at The Cracker Barrel. I hear the Nobu at Caesars is much nicer.",

    "text": "Last night we celebrated our 22nd anniversary with a 7 course tasting menu for two at Nobu.  My husband found a $129 certificate on Travelzoo.  It was worth every penny!!  He enjoyed a Japanese whiskey Old Fashioned and I had chilled sake wine.  We began with edamame with peanuts and chili sauce.  It was followed by sashimi tuna in miso mustard sauce.  Then we were served a plate with a sashimi and sushi mixture.  Next were tiger shrimp in a yoghurt miso sauce.  Finally came tempura sea bass followed by medium rare tenderloin!  Wow!  Dessert was banana egg roll.  They also treated us to a mini molten chocolate cake with miso sorbet on the house for our anniversary!  I highly recommend Nobu, just be aware that it can be very pricey without a certificate!",

Soba fritters - similar to polenta fries Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno - this was super flavorful Mixed sushi and roll - typical sushi and nigiri Miso black cod - super moist and flavorful Grilled beef strip loin with anticucho sauce - tasted more like a mexican dish rather than japanese Donuts and ice cream   Everything was good but like I said earlier, it didn't feel like we got a deal. The $95 we paid felt right. This makes me realize how expensive it would be coming here without a deal.  For a similar style, format and pricing (no deal needed), check out Yonaka. It's a must for us everytime we are in Vegas.  I would come back but only with a similar deal. Otherwise it's really expensive for what it is.",

    "text": "I like this place but...  To be brutally honest I kind of think it's highly overrated. The food is actually very tasty. No issues there. Even their mixed drinks are some of the best I've ever had. My issue is with the value of it all. Is it really worth it? Some people have no issue throwing money way and just accept the cost of fine dining as being ridiculous but the truth is it doesn't have to be that way. I've been to other fine restaurants that one might call very expensive but I've gotten larger portions, better service, and paid less. In some cases far less. Just because I have money doesn't mean I'll forget growing up and not having it. It's really hard to justify the high cost of most of these dishes despite them being really good. Moreover I've gone to other restaurants where I've spent hundreds on the meal but I actually left feeling full. The portions here are so small it feels more akin to a tasting than a full on dining experience. The employees are nice and friendly but there is definitely a feeling of undeserved pretentiousness in the air. If I'm being highly critical (which you better believe I am of any establishment that charges premium prices) is on two consecutive visits I ordered a coke. Simple request right? Why did it take ten minutes on one visit and nearly twenty minutes on my very last visit? I can go to any establishment and get a coke in a minute or less. If I'm paying $95 (jk it wasn't $95) for a tiny coke bottle why should I have to wait twenty minutes? I went to another fine restaurant where I ordered a coke and not only was I given a coke in an acceptable amount of time they set down a fancy glass pitcher at the center of the table. When I went to refill my coke because I'm not spoiled and I have hands I reached across my table which led my server running over and saying \"Please let me get that for you, Sir.\" He than grabbed the pitcher with elegance and proceeded to refill my glass. He did this numerous times because I love me a coke. Here's the thing though the pitcher was maybe two feet away from my freaking hand! There's no reason for someone to pour it for me! Aside from the fact that dinner cost me a couple hundred bucks when I could of eaten anywhere else for way less and gotten your average service. That's why I'm being highly critical of Nobu. Because if I ask for a goddamn coke at those prices I want my server to get it into my mouth in under a minute. I want him/her to bring it over to my table, display the bottle and tell me what year it was made, proceed to tell me how 2018 was a good year while gently pouring it into my mouth, squeeze my cheeks to swish it around for me, make a satisfied \"aah\" sound so I don't have to and then tell me what coke facility it was bottled at and how the coke products are excellent this time a year. That's the level of service I want when I'm paying out the ying yang because at most highfalutin places it's not just about the food. It's about the food and the experience.   Long story short you can't go wrong at Nobu. Everything is delicious but it's not necessarily as amazing as people make it out to be. Naturally, I assume when people do talk up Nobu it's because they haven't had many upscale dining experiences. You'll enjoy your minuscule meal and leave with your pockets turned inside out assuming the gambling floor didn't get you first.",

Look for Mulan who is a lovable host and she will tell you everything in detail about the experience you are going to live. We chose the seven dishes flight chose by then (Mulan and the chef) and they brought exquisite dishes, one better than the other. From Japanese yellow tail sashimi to red snapper, incredible shrimps and tuna tartar likesh, plus a spectacular tender meat. The desert simple fantastic, white chocolate mousse with grapefruit and sweet cracker, yum, yum... the end is a little bit painful, because after enjoying that kind of palate experience the bill is kind of high $$$ but well, once a year, not a big deal, right?!",

We were seated immediately.  It is a smaller dining room but it actually made for an intimate experience.  I wish I could walk you through what we ate.  But I can't remember the names. What I can say is that we let Ed, our server create a tasting menu for us. He did a fabulous job. We told him only to avoid anything with mayo. We had 3 cold sashimi courses,  some yummy cod dish and then the best steak ever! I didn't enjoy the carpacio,  but I have texture issues.  As such we got the finale steak well done and it was so juicy and moist that we couldn't believe it. We were too full to continue to the sushi course. They served us a great chocolate cake for our anniversary at no charge. I think our hotel concierge must have informed them.  Now. It's in the Hard Rock Resort, which is really sketchy. That is the only draw back. Once you get into the restaurant you overlook what you have to walk through and just enjoy!",

And you would EXPECT the chef to know how to cook a lobster tail so it doesn't come out like rubber. We got the $200 a head Omakase and it was okay but definitely nothing to rave about. I've been to many other authentic Japanese places that were much much better. The service was exceptional tho and that's why I gave the 3 stars. The Manager knew it was unexceptable for the lobster to come out that way and took it off our bill. The sake list was sparse and very disappointing. If you're going to serve ONLY Nobu sake, it BETTER BE GOOD! Even the Premium tasted of cheap sake. Tsk tsk!! People who spend this kind of money EXPECT QUALITY!

    "text": "Oh Nobu, how fun it is to say your name :)  Soooo ... I'm not a frequenter of the Hard Rock (because either you stay there or you have to cab it from the strip - and I ain't made o' money people), but last time I was there I had to stop in and try the (in)famous Nobu!  Now ... to be fair I had no idea this place was famous (the rock I live under doesn't get the food channel), and I thought it was mostly a sushi place (which it isn't - according to the waiter), but I had a great time anyway.   As soon as you sit down the waiter comes and tells you about the place and what they do. Apparently they cater the menu to the group on the table etc. I wouldn't know that because we actually never got a menu. The waiter told us about the famous Omakase (where the chef's send you what they want for ridiculous amounts of money) and we were sold!!   We got three different tears of Omakase - $110, $125 & $150 - so that we could try a little bit of everything. It's an 8 course array of hot and cold dishes. If you get this, prepare to wait ... it took us a solid 2 hours to get through the 8 courses - which gets you full and drunk if you're drinking like we were (the sake comes in cute tea pots and the plum wine is amazing).   I will say that the best bang for your buck is definitely the $125 dollar option. It's worth the $15 upgrade. The $150 option is when you can tell they're trying a little too hard to be different (food doesn't have to be unpronounceable, it just has to be good).   Most of the dishes were actually pretty good - but there were a few that were underwhelming (the hot dishes in particular were not great - and those were the ones the waiter said they were known for). I did enjoy the pallet cleansers a lot though.   The great thing about a place like Nobu is that no matter how fancy it is, it's still in the hard rock, and you'll still find a group of bachelors blowing up penis balloons and sending them flying around the restaurant (one even hit  me on the back of the head - war wounds are sexy!).",

    "text": "Nobu used to be the shining star 10 years ago when these babies started popping up all over the US in fancy-pants areas like Malibu but since that time other Japanese chefs have come into play and the glamor and innovation of the Nobu chain has faded.  The good news is that you can still come to Nobu and get a great meal.  If you want to feel satisfied you will still drop a lot of $$$.  Perhaps stop by the convenience store on your way over and fill up on a candy bar before eating here to avoid the full financial exposure.    My friend and I ate here before seeing Guns N Roses play at The Joint on a Friday night.  Most weekend nights will see Nobu booked up at least until 9PM.  It is open seating in the bar area but this area is tiny.  Nobu strictly enforces their dress policy so no swimming trunks.  It is dinner only so if you are hankering for Nobu at lunch sorry Charlie.  My favorite things were their pop rock shrimp, sea bass and fresh salmon sashimi.  Their hand rolls are pretty awesome too.  We split a bottle of cold sake that was excellent though a bit overpriced.  Our waiter was a complete snob but I will let that slide.  I highly recommend Nobu for a tasty sushi dining experience.",

The yellowtail sashimi was great, we had to order 3 servings. The Eel roll was great. We ordered a filet that came out in a covered sizzling skillet and it was cooked to perfection . The manager came and greeted us at the table and brought 3 desserts. The banana ice sorbet was great. I'll be back next time I'm in town",

    "text": "We could never get reservations whenever we were in New York so we decided to jump at the chance to go to the Nobu at the Hard Rock Casino (There's also one at Caesar's). And the food lived up to all the hype as every dish was an orchestra of flavors and perfectly cooked/sliced proteins.   For instance when biting into the barracuda sashimi you first taste the tartness of the yuzu which is then overcome by the fattiness of the fish and the bread crumbs and finally you are hit by the small crunchy garlic chips.   The wait staff is very attentive and they ask that you simply answer a couple of questions about preferences and price points and they then come up with a tasting menu. We gave them no restrictions and what came out of the kitchen for about $120 per person was amazing.   Our impromptu tasting menu included two of Nobu's iconic dishes -- miso-glazed black cod and the jalapeno yellowtail. Like the barracuda, both of these dishes also had several flavor profiles developing on the taste buds. There were also several other dishes and a full plate of sushi, each of which would be the best in almost any city.  Our server, I believe she said her name was Ti, was also a highlight as she showed an honest exuberance and pride in the food that she was serving, which made us even more excited to try it.  For drinks, my wife had a respectable cucumber martini and I had an interesting version of the Sidecar -- an Old School drink but with yuzu being used to create the tartness.  One warning: The dining room is not the quiet, reverential temple that many high-end restaurants foster. There is an energy to the place which befits the Hard Rock Casino and Hotel.",

    "text": "Expect to spend some money if you go here. Don't be cheap! Nobu is a great place to go for a special occasion or... if you just have..... a lot of money. The sushi is definitely fresh and the warm dishes are absolutely delicious! The inside is clean, nice and has modern decor. The sushi bar is quite large and there's also a bar and lounge in the front. The spicy tuna roll is different from any other place that I've tried. It does not have the minced up tuna but instead a nice, thick slice of tuna with a spicy, scallion sauce. Also, the rolls have the rice on the inside not on the outside, like you find at most places now a days. The rolls are small, so they fit right into your mouth with one bite. Some things that I recommend are the yellowtail jalapeno... it is to die for. The yellowtail is fresh and the jalapeno pepper gives it a little kick. The black cod miso is absolutely delicious, it melts in your mouth. The rock shrimp tempura is really good as well. They also have new cocktails every month, so ask your server or the bartender what the special cocktails are. The lychee martini is really good!  Nobu is also a great place to spot celebrities. If you dine here you'll most likely see at least one celebrity. It's a hot spot.  Try Nobu and you won't be disappointed but I have to say again, don't be cheap!!! Enjoy the ambiance and the great food.",

    "text": "!-!-!A-M-A-Z-I-N-G-!-!-! OK, so first off, I have never been a seafood fan, never mind sushi so this was my second time and it was AMAZING!!  Everything you've heard about Nobu is True!  I read the reviews and was down to try it when bf suggested it on our recent Vegas trip. So we get there and are seated immediately, kudos.  I ordered the champagne 59 or some concoction and bf orders the mango martini-both are very yummay!!  But I think the mango was the better of the two!   So, me being a newbie on the sushi scene I was a bit intimidated by the menu and just jumped in and ordered the tuna tempura roll off the cold menu to start off with, really wasn't sure but it proved to be GOOD!!! OMG, even bf, who isn't really down with tuna, was floored.  The tuna had scallions in the middle I believe....whatever it was delish!  And the sauce it had was SOOOO GOOD, I don't even know what it was, I should've asked.  OK, shit was so good after we ordered the next 2 rolls, we ordered another order of the tuna tempura, and the tempura was so slight, it great crunch to the tiniest degree. Next, we ordered the soft shell crab roll was again a mystery.  Was a very welcome bite to my mouth, I don't know what else was in it but had a crunch also.  The crab was very good, not a hint of the seafoody about it!  Also on our table was the shrimp tempura roll, I know tempura is a no-no to the sushi elite, but training wheels here kids!  Never mind that, this roll was a fave!  I also ordered another plate of this little roll because I loved it SO MUCH!  Again, tiny bit of the tempura crunch=goodness!  The amazingness of this is too good to put into words......I AGAIN don't even know what was in it besides the skrimps but I honestly feel like going there again, like NOW.   So for dessert i ordered this thing described as apple brioche with caramel sauce that comes with a gelato.  It came out and looked like little donut holes!  Was so good!  They were covered in sugar and inside was tiny chopped up apples and on the side in a little spoon was the carmel. Little bites of fried heaven!   As for service-stellar! She was on it when we needed drinks and more sushi, but she kinda lacked when I asked about rolls.  That's OK, I walked out very happy!",

Nobu on the strip is incredible. I had one of the best dining experiences here of my life. Their service was amazing. Our waiter, Andrew (5 stars+!!), took our menus away from us in the early going. His confidence that he could order better than us was not misplaced. What followed as an incredible sampling from across the menu. We were exposed to a variety of flavors and types of sushi. It seemed that right after we finished a dish, and had a moment or two to talk it over, another roll appeared. I can't describe how wonderful and timely the service was. Maybe this is the best way - The next night we literally cut a meal at another sushi place short halfway through and jumped a cab back to Nobu. We were glad we did. Thank you Nobu, and thank you Andrew! Cheers.",

We had a seven course chef's tasting menu that was OUT OF THIS WORLD. The dishes that stood out were the yellow tail sashimi with jalapeno, the lobster tacos, and the whole yellow tail that came out on a stand so that it was upright and looking at you while you pulled the moist meat off of its carcass. Everything was great, including the service. I hope to go back and have another 7 course meal there someday!",

Since Nobu is known for his innovative hot and cold dishes, I wish I had ordered a bunch of those instead.  One thing I did get to try was the Sea Urchin Tempura, which was very unique and tasty.  However, they really could've made the Omakase Sushi more interesting and worth the hefty price.  The sushi was fresh and all, but not very innovative or interesting at all.  It was just simple, no-frills negiri sushi.  I've had some fantastic and creative omakase sushi at more humble Japanese restaurants, so I thought Nobu could've done the same.  Perhaps I'll try one of Nobu's LA restaurants sometime.",

I don't eat sushi, but there were plenty of other options for me. I had the shrimp and Maine lobster with spicy lemon sauce. Overall great flavor although some pieces of the lobster were just a tad rubbery (which is why I dinged my review one star). I must have been really hungry that night, because I wasn't full after my main course. So it was tempura to the rescue -- shrimp, asparagus and sweet potato. That helped tremendously. I do think the service could have been a bit quicker for our drinks, which seemed to not arrive as they should have. The waitstaff otherwise was friendly and attentive.",

    "text": "i've been dying to try out nobu and matsuhisa in LA for the longest time, but the thought of making a drive that far just for sushi just couldn't be justified...until now. Nobu is actually a japanese fusion restaurant, so for all of you purest out there, this is not your dining of choice.  now for the food...the ingredients are what make japanese food such a delicacy. And when it comes to seafood, especially sashimi, if your stock isn't fresh, i can taste it. that said, we decided to stuff our faces for the True nobu experience.   *the YK50 is a semi-dry and rather sweet sake that was super light *shishito peppers - grilled peppers w/ an extremely simple miso sauce w/ toasted sesame *tuna tataki. great sauce, perfect w/ the daikon and garlic chips. *kumamoto oysters. not the best i've had, the sauces actually took away from the natural sweetness of this variety of oyster. *yellowtail sashimi w/ jalapenos. probably my favorite of the meal. extremely simple sauce w/ a spicy bite. my mouth is salivating just thinking about it :p *sashimi salad. we got a tuna/hamachi mix instead. it had a delicious miso dressing on a medley spring mix *amai ebi. it was a little oily this time, but the shrimp was ridiculously fresh. *crunchy roll w/ king crab. probably my least favorite of the night. it was creative though with the crunch topping that gave a nice twist on the typical roll. *tempura plate. the vegetables were so sweet, it didn't even require the tentsuyu (tempura sauce) *fried shrimp w/ butter ponzu sauce. butter and ponzu is an amazing combination. so its not typical japanese but definitely try this one if you get a chance.   i do believe i've never truly experienced a food coma until tonight.",

We ordered the hamachi with jalapenos, miso glazed sea bass, grilled yellow tail collar, toro roll, grilled eggplant, and bento box dessert.   The hamachi was the best dish - fresh and flavorful.  The bass was a generous portion and had good flavor, but the texture was mushy (maybe not cooked enough?).  The yellow tail collar was cooked perfectly, but the skin was not scaled!  Disappointing that they overlooked something so simple.  The toro roll was very small - definitely not worth the cost.  The eggplant also had good flavor, but the sauce was too sweet.  The bento box was awesome, as usual.  Service: 4.  Our server was attentive and comp'd us for the dessert (we were celebrating a special occasion), but a bit aloof.  I asked what kind of salt was on the edamame, but the response was a flippant, \"sea salt.\"  Another server overheard the exchange and gave me the name of the brand on a piece of paper.",

When I got my exorbitantly overpriced food and saw how little food was on the plate I immediately wanted to just ditch the table and leave without paying out of principle.  I suggested the idea to Russ and he said naww just stay.  When I tasted what I got I was a bit dumbfounded about how average it was.  I could have gotten something tasting just as good elsewhere, at 1/5th the price, with bigger portions, and without the pretentious attitude that food should be organized on a plate like it's some kind of f'n Picasso.  Just put the damn food on the plate and leave it alone.  Bottom line:  not a place worth going to unless you're rich, overly insecure about your penis size, have a small appetite, and don't mind being ripped off in general.  Even if I were a billionaire the simple principle of the whole thing would keep me from going back.  This place is crap.  Go to Burger King instead.",

The menu was confusing and it almost felt like this was done on purpose in order to force the diner to chose the chef's tasting menu. We decided against it (at $100+ per person, we felt we could do better). We chose the Lobster Ceviche, Big Eye Tuna Tempura Roll and the Nobu Style Lobster Tacos to start. The tacos were insanely delicious and everything hit the mark quite well. These composed the \"cold\" dishes that Nobu offers and then we moved on to the hot dishes which included Kobe Beef Tataki style, Black Cod with Miso as well as some Sashimi. The Kobe beef was incredible and literally melted in our moths and it's no wonder the Cod is a famous dish - it was delicious. Looking at the menu now I'm uncertain as to why we felt the way we did, but I remember being less than enthused about dropping a few hundred dollars and not feeling like I got real value from our money. The atmosphere was cold and had it been a little friendlier perhaps we would have felt differently. The food felt like a celebrity chef was overseeing it, but you could tell this restaurant was a chain given how gimmicky everything was. Sad because there's such a brand behind this name and they're just not living up to it.",

I didn't think much about this place when he brought it up, my expectations were pretty much non-existent.  Once we got to the restaurant, it was top notch from start to finish.  We ordered quite a bit of different dishes and it was delicious down to the last bite.  Our waiter was quite helpful with our decision making and recommendations.  First dish on our table was the Fresh Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno.  This dish is awesome!  The flavoring along with the fresh Yellowtail easily makes this my favorite dish at this restaurant.  We also had the Monkfish Pate, Sashimi Salad, Black Cod with Miso, Broiled Yellowtail Collar; Creamy Spicy Crab, Rock Shrimp Tempura with Ponzu and Creamy Spicy Sauce.  All around delicious dishes with great visual presentation.  Their Lychee Martini is also worth a mention, a tasty treat.  I highly recommend this restaurant for those who haven't tried it yet.  This is easily one of my top 10 restaurants.  Just a wonderful experience from beginning to finish!",

Very thin sliced fish served in a warmer than room temperature sesame oil sauce sprinkled with chives. Now it's on to the yellow tail w/ jalapeno peppers.  Melt in your mouth!  Next is the popcorn shrimp, not too breaded, crunchy and that sauce...yum!  Chilean Seabass is next up- buttery, tender and the flavor is indescribable.  Black Cod w/ miso sauce- perhaps my favorite dish. It's done right!  And believe me, I make this at  home, it's hard to find a miso paste that has the right balance so not to over power the fish.  So yeah, this is an expensive place to dine but I am never disappointed.  I am not a big portion person, if you are, you'd hate it or go broke here. I love the quality, care and presentation of every dish here.  Wine list is good and cocktails are imaginative.  Service is always good here and if you don't take my word about the aforementioned menu options, the wait staff is happy to recommend and explain the dishes in great detail.",

She was friendly enough but service was slow.  They brought out all our food and it was pretty boring.  I ordered the Shrimp Tempura hand roll and it wasn't rolled well and was basically just rice with a shrimp tempura and a tiny bit of sauce.  I ordered Albacore sushi and it was not that great...albacores my favorite.  The salmon sashimi was okay.  I'd definitely say this place is overpriced for what you get.  After we were done eating, the waitress brought us another order of everything we had just eaten and said the kitchen messed up and we could have this food for free.  That was cool but since the food wasn't that great, we weren't too thrilled.

It will start subtly, build up anticipation, then rock you with the chorus, keep you there for a while, and slowly let you down.  This is True of any good thing, a good book, a good time, a good movie, and life if you do it all right.  If you understand this principle, then the same is applicable with a good meal.  I made the mistake ordering the Chef's Choice during my one and last visit to Nobu on one of my many excursions to Vegas.  The anticipation of eating here is enough with all the effort required just to get in the door of this place.  When you do walk in, you will be dazzled.  Everything is beautiful here, the paint on the walls, the sculptures you'll pass on your way to being seated, the kitchen, the staff, and even the patrons.  And when you finally do get your first course, you will feel as if you just might be taken to a place you have never been before.  It is so good.  But then the rest of the meal just doesn't follow the principle mentioned above.  The order of things was wrong.  Some courses didn't build on the last.  By the time you finish the last course, you can't remember the first.  Because taken as a whole the meal is forgettable.  Now my friends that ordered entrees coupled with various sushi plates, their meals were wonderful.  But it is a big disappointment especially since the Chef's Choice is Nobu's flagship dish and most expensive item.  You are ultimately left with an empty experience afterwards.  Which is the case with the whole experience at Nobu.  It ended up being empty which had a lot to do with the content of my stomach after the meal.  As it too was empty.  I can see where Nobu get's its reputation.  You'll be able to see this too when you walk into this place.  But you will also be able to see that a lot of that is due to style and has little to do with sustenance (pun intended).",

First off, I will tell you...I had simply the best spicy scallop roll I've ever had in my sushi lovin life there. You could taste how fresh the scallop was and it was huge pieces. Their take on ceviche I was less than taken with. The prices were out of control, but hey it's Vegas right?   I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there, but if you are staying at the HRH, definitely have dinner one night.",

Went down like this...  2 huge plates of yellowtail jalapeno and tuna tataki king crab ceviche which was incredible kobe beef served sizzling on hot stones which I would've just preferred rare but still excellent medium rare black cod miso filet (wait...things are still getting better??) huge plate of sushi to top it all off  Tasted even better comped :)  I cannot wait to go back here!!",

It's savory sweet and done perfectly. -Yellow tail with jalapeno, I could seriously eat 10 orders of this.  Don't order the sushi rolls, they aren't anything special and not worth it.",

We ordered sushi (which was nothing special), the Chilean sea bass (can't go wrong with this), and kobe beef ($28/ounce; we ordered 3 ounces [minimum]) Tataki style.  The kobe beef was amazing, but the price was a little outrageous.  Personally, I believe that Nobu is over-hyped; it's an experience (we saw several famous people), but not a place that I'd return to.   (+) quality and freshness of ingredients, positive and upbeat atmosphere, friendly and knowledgeable waitstaff (-) pricey, sushi was sub-par",

    "text": "Totally disappointed at this place. I should've listened to my friend who went there and was really disappointed at their omakase, but noooo, I had to go and throw down two bills to prove to myself how much they sucked.   The decor was nothing to write home about. I think there was an overuse of bamboo in the place, the chairs were Ikea and the tables were just weirdly laid out.   First of all, I couldn't understand the cutesy English the waitress was speaking. Each time she said something, we would pause for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 seconds, since we couldn't tell if she was asking us a question or making a statement. Then it'd be followed by, \"I'm sorry, what?\"  We ordered chilean sea bass in the black bean sauce, the crab ceviche, and some grilled beef thing. The ceviche was overwhelmingly tangy. I think it reshaped some of my fillings in my teeth. There was a lot of it though, even though the waitress told us that they were small portions. We next had the chilean sea bass which was not good at all. Again, portion was decent, but it was bland and not even hot. Finally, the meat came and although tender, it just wasn't as flavorful as I expected.  For being \"Nobu,\" I did have high expectations. But DK and I evaluated it and said that even if this was a no-name restaurant that we just walked into, we still wouldn't have thought it was good.   And by the next morning, we were telling people that it just \"sucked.\" And I'm sticking with that.   So for those of you who speak Mandarin, you know that \"bu\" means \"don't.\"  So this restaurant's name is a forewarning of a the answer you'll give when asked, \"So was it good?\" or \"Is it worth going?\"  No. Bu.",

    "text": "So, as many of these reviews state, \"Nobu is expensive.\" Yes, but it is exactly what an expensive restaurant should be. High quality, professional service and top of the line food. I have eaten at Nobu at the Hard Rock Casino in Vegas 3 times now and I find it excellent.   My average bill per person has been about $150. This is including a $60 bottle of saki and a couple of $15 martini's. Without drinks, my wife and I probably would have spend about $100-$120 each. This is also without trying to go cheap. If you wanted to eat here on a budget, it would be completely possible to order a couple of $12-$15 Sushi rolls and a couple of $12-$15 skewers and get out of there with a tab that runs about $60 or $70. However, in my opinion that would be defeating the purpose because while you can budget yourself into turning this place into a typical sushi bar, the real goods and their signature dishes that separate them from the rest are the more expensive plates.   Their main signature dish is their yellowtail- jalepeno sashimi. Definitely an appetizer portion, but very tasty if you like sashimi. My personal favorite is their blackened cod in a butter-lettuce wrap. The last time I was there it was not listed on the menu but when I mentioned it they knew exactly what I was talking about and whipped it up for us. Also an appetizer portion, but very different and very good. The fish literally melts in your mouth. Another recommendation is the Wagyu Beef Gyoza. It's sort of a beef filled pot-sticker that is cooked to perfection. The beef is imported either from Japan or from Australia, depending on which one you decide to go with, and comes with an incredible dipping sauce. A little more filling of an order as well. Their sushi rolls are good, but nothing you can't get at another place that makes good sushi. However, I recommend getting a couple rolls to get yourself filled up then get a couple of their specials in order to keep your cost reasonable.   The service is great. Then waiters and waitresses have a good attitude and they know the menu like the back of their hand. If you just tell them what you're feeling they can put together a meal that works for you. There is someone coming by to fill up your water or bring you another drink every time you need it and they all have been well trained in how to communicate at a high end table.   As much as I like to branch out and try new restaurants, this place is always going to be hard for me to pass up when I am in town.",

The food was about as appreciated as cruddy bellybutton cheese on a model's stomach. The rolls were blah average, the dynamite mayo was either old or bottom-shelf, making it taste like something even the Dutch wouldn't want, and the even the simplest Unagi was about as tasty as conveyor belt sushi.   I'll give props to the service, as the waitstaff and host were great, but man.... for that kind of price, I'd have expected something more....... Maybe they're just too \"famous\" to care at this location.   TOMMY BURGER PLEASE!!!!",

There really isn't much I can say at this point that can convince you this is one of the finest Japanese restaurants in the country. 400+ Yelp reviews, and almost all of them are 4 and 5 stars.  I will just leave you with some advice:  1. Don't come here drunk. You will leave with a bill that is closer to a G. You may not enjoy it as much either. 2. Order the Black Cod Miso. Hands down the best dish that I've ever tasted. 3. You can come in a large group, but groups of 4 are best. They serve small plates. Intimate dining at it's best. 4. Service is solid, be sure to tip well. This isn't the Outback or Chili's. Don't treat it like your typical Vegas fare. 5. Yes, it's a chain now. It never used to be. But the quality hasn't skipped a beat. 6. Go to Nobu in every city you visit (if there is one). 7. Make a reservation.  Follow these rules, and you will have one of the best dining experiences of your life.  Be prepared to spend some coin. It is worth it.   Peace out.",

    "text": "As a vegetarian, I'm often very wary of Japanese restaurants.  Don't get me wrong - I love sushi - but don't eat fish.  Part of a vacation, a good friend (a meat-eater and self-denied foodie) found this place as our go to for a serious Las Vegas food experience.  He had lived in NYC and eaten at that location - and knew that the Hard Rock location had a lot to live up to.  It didn't let either of us down.  In fact, it was so good, that even at $100 per person we seriously considered going back the next night.  It's been some time, so in all fairness I'm having trouble remembering the specific ingredients in the dishes, but know that each course was a sensory experience.  Some were for touch, some for smell, most for sight, some for sound, and ALL for taste.  The flavors were incredible - hitting many of the core flavors in every single bite.  Sweet, salt, spice, hot, cold, acidic, creamy - just writing this makes me want to jump on a plane tonight to try to catch the last seating.  And the sake!  Oh, the sake :)  If I were to knock off even 1 star, it'd be because it's a little ways off the strip - at the Hard Rock.  So if you're totally strip-centric, maybe not your best bet.  It also felt a little cold - we definitely were not seated at the most comfortable table, but none looked uber posh.  And of the 6 courses I was served, one felt sub par.  But believe me - the level of service, the quality of ingredients and the expert preparation made this one of the top 3 meals in my life.",

    "text": "This would have been four stars, but the inner kitchen made a serious error.  The decor was natural, grounding, with a slightly modern twist.  The restaurant was too loud, but the noise was voices and the casino a bit.  It would have been much better if it wasn't so loud and you could concentrate on the food.    I ordered the specialty tasting menu which is a seven course meal that is over a hundred dollars.  I made it known to my server that I eat \"Kosher style only fish that have scales and fins, when alive e.g., salmon, Tuna, white fish, etc, No shell fish under any circumstances, lard, red meat, or gelatin unless it is seaweed gelatin.\"     The hors d'oeuvres, salad, and specialty roles were amazing!  They told stories in my mouth and gave me a unique and exhilarating experience. The warm dishes were good, but the specialty rolls are so much better.  Stay away from the basic sashmi and regular rolls.  It wasn't worth it for the price.     The fiasco really started when I was given miso soup with shells in it!  That type of error should NOT happen.  It was a mistake in the kitchen, but the manager was very lucky that I was not allergic.  While she apologized, and asked how she could make it right.  I had to suggest a discount.  I think that it should have been immediately offered.  To the manager's credit she did ask if I had a shell fish allergy, and she did go immediately to talk to the kitchen, but that kind of error is inexcusable to me.  This is especially True given how much I stressed no shell fish and how severe shell fish allergies can be.",

We got the chef's special menu, which was a sampling of their most popular dishes, and it was well over $100 a head.  I had to stop at In-N-Out on the way home because I was still starving.    None of the food was bad, it was just tiny and costs about 5 times what it should have.    I take back my first sentence.  If you want to go somewhere to brag about, skip Nobu and head to Tao.  At least I was full after that over-priced meal.",

We ordered the omakase and all the courses were to die for. My favorite was the series of carpaccio and the buttery fish. I came here for my birthday with a group of 10 or so. Service was a little spotty at first, but they brought food out rapidly so I had no complaints.  Definitely pricey, but hey, it's Vegas.",

    "text": "Maybe it's becuase I live in a state not known for it's seafood -- but Nobu consistently has the BEST sushi and fish I've ever eaten.     It is the first reservation I make when going to Las Vegas or Dallas for work.    Yep it's pricy but I have dreams about it -- it's that good !!   And i've even paused my television when I saw some psuedo celebs eating there on some reality tv show -- when they were eating my favorite things.  The trick is really to just get the good stuff -- it's over the top fantastic but when I try new stuff it never quite lives up to the others ..  1,  Yellowtail with Jalapeno -- get at least 2 orders -- I could eat 3-4 by myself if I really tried hard.  2.  Black Cod with Miso -- either version (in lettuce cups or not)  3.   Tuna Sashimi Salad -- yum !!!  4.   Any other sushi -- but if you get rolls - I suggest you pay extra for rice paper instead of seaweed (did this cuz one friend is allergic to seaweed and it makes the fish stand out).  5.  Rock Shrimp  6.  Yellowtail with Jalapeno  7.  Yellowtail with Jalapeno  8.   Yellowtail with Jalapeno  9.   Yellowtail with Jalapeno  10.  Yellowtail with Jalapeno   (Did you get it yet ???)  And the service is always TOP NOTCH !!!    Attentive and knowledgeable ....   and the drinks are FANTASTIC TOO !  It is a spendy dinner -- but in my opinion -- totally worth it !!!",

    "text": "I must admit, I have not been to a Nobu that I didn't like.  So yes, I am a fan of this high-end Japanese chain restaurant.  We had dinner here this past Friday night.  Unfortunately I am not fond of the hotel that it's located in... which is barely a step up from a Hooters-type ambiance with the class-less tatted out clientele and their hoochie mama's attached to their hips.  Well back in the day Hard Rock was the place to go to... but that was years ago.  So the fact that one has to step foot into the Hard Rock Casino to get into the entrance of this restaurant... should really get a minus star for not strategically relocating this at a more ritzy hotel casino like Bellagio or Cosmopolitan.     We started off with cocktails... Lychee martini and a greyhound... can't go wrong there.  As for the app...started off with the sea salted warm edemame.  I was so hungry, I practically ate all the soy beans.  I ordered the yummy Kelp salad and he ordered Hamachi sashimi with Jalepeno... so perfectly fresh with Ponzu sauce or Miso... so good!  He ordered the Shrimp with spicy garlic was sinfully delicious... (fried so not a healthy choice).  And I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with dried miso... my all time favorite, which did not disappoint!  Salmon, Hamachi and Unagi sushi... small but still so good.  AND we ended with yet another cocktail :-) and the Bento Box.... flourless chocholate cake with white chocolate sauce and green tea ice cream... OMG!  Amazing dinner with outstanding service.  Yes Nobu is expensive but I was fortunate that he was so generous... so not really sure what our bill was... but so worth every bite.",

The sushi is so delicious and the service is very kind. They are very happy to recommend their favorites and tell you a little bit about the different orders of food.

Crispy exterior with a flaky moist interior.  Dip that in the miso butter sauce and you have gone to heaven.  Obviously, Nobu is know for its sushi so going here will not let you down. GO!!!",

Although Nobu is famous for their sushi I actually forwent having any and instead went for their superior and more unique hot and cold dishes. One constant stand out that I have had before is their blackened cod in butter lettuce cups. The varying textures and tastes are a perfect pairing. If you go you must ask for this as it is not on their menu. I also had the tempura fried rock shrimp in the creamy spicy sauce and again it was perfect, yummy, wow.   For dessert we had the mochi ice cream. And as you can read in my review of Bubbies in Honolulu it probably would've been just as good or better to have gone to Whole Foods afterwards and picked some up. Still is was very good but not Bubbies.  My only criticism is that this high style establishment is located in the Hard Rock. Kinda feels a little out of place but either way anytime I'm back in Vegas I will undoubtably be back.",

This was recommended to me by my dinner companion when I went to Ame, a palate I trust. So even after many disappointing fine dining restaurants on hotel properties, I figured I would give Nobu a shot. Should of known better...  Standard menu as well as two different tier of omakase available, $100 & $135 if I recall correctly. We decided to do the $135 version for all three of us, three cold course, two hot course, followed by soup, sushi, and dessert.  Writing this up a week later, can't remember exactly what we had, weekend in Vegas tends to short circuit one's memory.   Think we started with a course of Bonito sashimi, which was fresh and nice flavor combinations. The two other cold course wasn't particularly memorable, very apparent since I can't recall much details on them. Moving onto the first hot course, which I do remember, but for the wrong reason. Some sort of white fish (Cod or Halibut), done in a sweet and sour stir-fry style with touch of spice. Sorry, but if this is what I am looking for, I'll take my money to Panda Express or any food court at a local mall. The second hot course was a steak, filet is the cut...I think. Topped with a piece of seared foie gras, couple slices of egg plant, and Shitake mushroom. Probably the best course of the evening and one of the very few steak course I've enjoyed as part of tasting menu, definite a rarity. Soup, sushi and dessert were brought up to conclude the omakase menu, all pedestrian, nothing to write home about.  Not only was the food not very interesting, the decoration of the space also seem kind of odd. What's suppose to be a fine dining restaurant, really has a very cheap feel to it. For anyone thinking about trying this place, think again, avoid if possible.",

I mean, the place isn't cheap and we knew that coming in but did we really need 8 orders of sashimi? I'm not going to overthink it because it's not that big of a deal and I was comfortably stuffed.

Amazing. Sadly, the two beef items we ordered Medium Rare came out closer to Medium Well. Inexcusable at these prices. The final dish we ordered took over 40 minutes and service took a nose dive after first few courses. Again, this is inexcusable to spend $800 for five people and not get stellar service.",

My husband and I were staying at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino on our honeymoon, and received a gift card to Nobu, at our request, from my sister-in-law.  I've heard nothing but good things, and they were ALL True.  We chose the OMAKASE menu option.  We had 9 courses EACH, and the dessert came with THREE different items, for each of us.  We spent just under $400 after the tip for both of us, and it was WORTH EVERY PENNY.  The service and food was absolutely impeccable.  Our server was AMAZING.  The manager came out to our table personally and presented us with the gift card my sister-in-law had purchased prior, over the phone.  He also provided us with complimentary glasses of champagne.  I am terrible at naming cuisine that I don't normally eat, so can't remember specifically all items we had, but for certain, the YELLOWTAIL TARTARE W/ CAVIAR, the MUSHROOM SOUP, the BLACK COD w/ MISO, the WAGYU BEEF and the CHOCOLATE MOLTEN CAKE, GREEN TEA ICE CREAM AND CAPPUCINO desserts were so delicious.  I have not one bad thing to say about the food or service at this place.  Nobu at the Hard Rock is a GEM in the middle of a loud and crazy city.  This meal was the highlight of our dining experience on our week-long honeymoon in Vegas.  I would eat here every single day if I could.",

    "text": "When a restaurant has the nerve to charge exorbitant prices for food, I damn well better get THE BEST taste and THE BEST service in my entire life. You will not get either one at Nobu. I came here the other night treating an unemployed friend for dinner, WHAT A SHAM. I asked the sushi \"chef\" what is good that day and he recommended the king crab roll. We said ok and this little roll came out and the taste was simply ok. I was not impressed at all. I was actually quite annoyed. I ordered some Uni and monkfish liver. Now when I order monkfish liver at any other sushi spot, I either get 2 pieces of sushi or a few medallion sized sashimi. At Nobu, I got one medallion-sized piece on a gigantic plate that was covered in this peach sauce. I was becoming rather bored and none of this tiny shit was fulfilling my appetite. I asked the chef what he has that's unusual and off the menu. He said the yellowtail or white tuna, you know, cuz NO other sushi place has that! I told him something a little more unique and he just didn't know what to offer. Finally he said live octopus. I ordered it and it just kinda arrived in front of me. I imagined it would've been prepared in front of me or shown to me before cutting it.. anything. I have no idea where it came from or how it looked. It was drenched in some sort of clear vinegar-like sauce with green stuff and all I tasted was this crap all over it.  I got the bill and almost ran the hell out! It was $198. FOR THAT CRAP! We ordered 4 lychee martinis which were good, not worth $56 for 4 of them.  TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS for the crab roll! $25 for the octopuss! $15 for the uni. I payed in absolute anger and disgust, left a 20% tip and got the hell out of there.  Honestly, I am a harsh critic, I admit that. HOWEVER, I feel financially raped by this place and am losing sleep over it. The food was SO not worth it. Anyone who knows sushi really well wouldn't be caught in this lame over-priced trap. It should be illegal to serve crap sushi covered in taste bud-overdose sauce! I will never EVER go near Nobu again and will warn people waiting to not bother.  Here's a big middle finger to Nobu nationwide.",

This place is very expensive...but the taste is extraordinary. The Black Cod with miso melts in your mouth. Every dish is a work of culinary art. The service at the Las Vegas restaurant is excellent. They constantly make sure everything is clean, and ready, glasses filled, and your needs are met. The bill for 6 of us was $270 before tip, so this is costly, but not too over-priced. It is definitely an upper echelon restaurant. The Las Vegas venue is situated in the middle of the Hard Rock Hotel and is therefore several decibels too high. If you eat there frequently you are going to lose your hearing. That is why I give it 4 stars. I can imagine this restaurant outside of the Hard Rock Hotel will be more pleasant. If you're in your 20-40's you'll probably give it 5 stars.",

The food here resembles Nobu's dishes but it lacks the attention I'm used to seeing.  I think what's to blame is the large amount of business this location gets which takes away from the quality of the dishes.  It's disappointing b/c I think the Hard Rock Hotel itself is one of the better casino venues in LV (music, ppl, energy, etc.) and I like going there to hang out.  If you go, order the yellowtail carpaccio as that's always a pleaser as well as the miso black cod.  Enough sake and beer and you might not care about the rest of what I said.  haha.  Vegas!",

    "text": "I agree with Ming-Jou in the fact that I was totally disappointed at this place. I should have also listened to my friend who went there and was really disappointed at their omakase, but being Japanese, I wanted to try their food to see what the hype was about.  We had reservations at 9 PM and although we got there earlier, they didn't seat us till then.  It was shockingly a loud place that we often had to yell at each other to talk and even to order.  Also, the crowd was much older than I anticipated.  The interior had a nice Asian feel to it with bamboos everywhere, even on the ceilings.  For starters, we had edamame, yellowtail tartar with caviar, and tempura.  The menu was vague that we didn't expect any sauce with the tartar, but to our surprise, it came in a sauce with wasabi that was a little spicy.  I wish the menu would have included more details.  We got to order individual tempura items, which was a \"first\" for me.  We ordered shrimp, broccoli, and sweet potato.  The order came with 2 pieces each.  I liked how it came out really hot with light batter.  Also, they were generous with their tempura sauce with daikon-oroshi (grated daikon).  Most places give you barely enough sauce.  For dinner, we shared the sushi dinner which came with 8 nigiri and 6 pieces of tekka maki (tuna roll).  The sushi rice tasted old as it was cold and flat, not warm and plump.  Also, the rice portion for a nigiri was much more than it needed.  Fish seemed fresh, but the rice was disappointing.  That ruined my dinner.  We decided to try their dessert since we don't usually order dessert at an Asian restaurant.  We tried their miso almond cake which was the best part of my meal.  It came with soy caramel glaze and edamame ice cream.  The cake was yummier than I expected.    Overall, it was not as good as I expected but I'm giving 3 stars for the good dessert and the great service.",

Rolls run about $49 per order.  They have hot dishes and cold dishes.  I kid you not when I say, every dish will be better than the next.  If you have never been here, ask for the Chef's Special.  They will bring an 8 course meal specially made by the Chef.  This will cost you $150 per person before drinks and gratuity.   If that's too steep, go for the piece by piece sushi.  They run about $12+ each piece.  The atmosphere is definitely who's who.  Beautiful people everywhere, great music, dim but can be quite loud.  Other than that, worth a visit and worth every penny.

My friend and I tried really hard but still couldn't finish the last 2 courses. However, I would have to say I wasn't impressed with the food overall.

Probably could eat 3 plates Black Cod Miso - Excellent but you better eat it with rice or share it  because the miso can become overwhelming.  But that could've been the 4 bottles of Grey Goose the night before speaking. Creamy Crab - tasty but salty, again good sharing. Creamy rock shrimp tempura - excellent. Blue fin toro with caviar - excellent. Blue fin toro with truffles - it was a special at the time and not really worth the $100 for 6 pieces.  Just order Blue fin toro sushi, sometimes simple is better. Would venture here every other trip to LV.  Haven't tried other Nobus to compare but will get a chance in the Bahamas.",

I chose Nobu based on New York's location and Philadelphia's Morimoto restaurant, but ended up being very underwhelmed. The black cod was a standout as is the case in most Japanese restaurants, straight from the ocean fresh, with a flavorful miso sauce. My seafood toban yaki was disappointing though, my favorite dish at Morimoto just didn't live up to expectation at Nobu. The broth was super salty and the quantity of seafood was just sort of lacking.  Overall the restaurant has a very hip and trendy vibe, our waiters were friendly and attentive without being overbearing, but all in all just a \"blah\" experience for a 25th birthday celebration.",

Now before I utilize Yelp to complain about sub-par service I must document the highlights, because as we know, an amazing kitchen can make up for lacking service.  The Black Cod Miso was a life changer. You owe it to yourself to have this dish. Also the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno was such a wonderful combination of flavors, that honestly, I can't find words to do it justice.  Now as to why Nobu earned 3 stars from me instead of 4. Our service lacked in every area, inattentive, unwilling to suggest menu items for our group of 5, and at times seemingly spiteful. Why did you bring us (2) Rock Shrimp Tempura? It's delicious don't get me wrong, but two?   Maybe the malice was because 2 people in our group were very late, and he was missing out on those additional tips, or because they couldn't include gratuity? I don't know. But when I'm spending $60-70 per person, I expect a little more.",

Our favorites are the black cod and the jalapeno sashimi. The sashimi is to DIE for. I live in the SF Bay Area where we have a million sushi joints and I have yet to find sashimi as wonderful as Nobu's - please if someone knows of a place let me know because I crave yummy sashimi. The spicy miso lotus chips with big eye tuna is delish too! Actually, we have been happy with everything we have tried.   Nobu is definitely on the pricey side but so worth every penny. We are always sure to take our time with our meal and savor every bite! Our bill is usually anywhere from $80 (no alcohol) to $120 (with alcohol). The other great thing is that all the wait staff work together so your plates are constantly cleared and your table cleaned. They even fold your napkin for you if you get up from the table.   The only reason why I give Nobu 4 stars instead of 5 is because every so often we will get a waiter who is pompous and thinks his shit doesn't stink, which is really unfortunate because most of the wait staff is really great! If I could knock only a half star off for that, I would!",

The interior is contemporary Japanese and beautiful. And the food was fantastic.  We had a tasty hamachi sashimi with jalapeno slices. I've had this dish at other places but Nobu slices the jalapenos paper thin and dresses the fish in a fantastic sauce. Their rendition also includes a cilantro leaf and I'm a huge fan of the herb. Great balance of flavors and quality of fish. Tuna sashimi salad. This is a mountain of crisp salad with the sashimi draped around the base. It's a little technically difficult to eat because I wasn't sure how to get it all in one bite. But the salad was delicious and the tuna was, of course, amazing. Blue fin toro with caviar. I think toro needs to be eaten as sashimi/nirigi or over rice as chirashi. Mincing it up seems wrong.  And the highlight was the lobster spiced dish with seven spices and liberal amounts of clarified butter. Holy Gawd!! This was fantastic!! It was an explosion of flavors in your mouth and utterly, indescribably delicious. They split the lobster lengthwise in half, cook the meat in large chunks, and then place it back into the shell. It makes for a beautiful presentation yet the tender chunks of meat are easy to remove and eat.  Interestingly, I've been to other Nobu restaurants and the menu is strikingly similar. I don't know why, but that seems odd.",

Second we had the other signature dish - black cod w miso.  The fish is cooked with a lovely butter texture - the sauce is rather sweet (the miso I presume) - reasonably substantial portion.  We finished with the chef's sushi plate ($75!!) which was a good variety of sushi - some had sweet or savory sauces but it was primarily just fish w wasabi on rice (the rice is rather sweet compared to other places).  The grand total for this was $150 before tip and we drank tap water.  Alcohol was ridiculously expensive so we didn't order anything to drink.  I would definitely go again but probably be a bit more adventurous w the menu choices.  There is also an option for 150/person where the chef just creates a menu for you - looks wonderful if you want to spend that much.  In sum excellent (but extremely expensive) sushi.  The fish is extremely fresh - a nice surprise in the desert.",

So did my boyfriend. We decided we had to make it to Nobu even if the apocalypse happened and giant flesh-eating gargoyles descended from the sky.  I did not plan to have a full meal at all but wouldn't you know it, I did. Ahhh, I love when upscale Japanese restaurants live up to the hype.  Yellowtail with jalapeno: Tender slices of my fish soulmate in an amazing soy yuzu sauce with just a little kick. Most perfect dish ever.  Beef tenderloin tabu yaki: Not quite as tender as kobe (is anything?) but delicious nonetheless.  Spicy scallop roll: Fresh and tasty. The boyfriend was blown away by it, I thought it was good but otherwise unremarkable. I think raw scallop might be his yellowtail, though.  Black cod with miso: Their signature dish. It's really hard to find fault with it. Tender, melt-in-your-mouth fish in a sweet, light sauce. It should be heavy, but it's not. That's the miracle of Japanese cooking.  Spicy seafood soup: My favorite kind of food--soupy, spicy, seafoody. Oh, and as an added bonus, loaded with more varieties of mushroom than a drug farmer. I have seen heaven and it's inside this bowl. Get it!  Now on to the Nobu Dessert Platter:  Bento Box: Flourless chocolate cake with a white chocolate sauce, shiso syrup and green tea ice cream. Like a Japanese molten cake. Did I mention that molten cake is like edible carnal sex? Well, it is. So get this. Just don't go all Matrix Reloaded in the restaurant.  Trio of mochi: Lessee, we got pumpkin spice, strawberry, and some flavor not known to man, stuffed with ice-cream and accompanied by sour Japanese mountain peaches. Mmm...  Bananas in phyllo dough with tropical glaze: Original creation not on the regular menu (haha!). It's crispy, fried bananas. Need I say more?  Haromajis in cinnamon and sugar and center is sweet potato puree: I totally didn't spell that right and since it's another original creation, I have no menu to look at. Already tried googling and found nothing. Anyway, this was incredible. I hate sweet potato and I thought this was da bomb. Yeah, I'm channeling 2001 lingo.  Eat here.",

Our server was Thomas and he could not have been better.  One of the best servers we've ever had.  He was friendly, on top of it and fantastic about explaining the restaurant, menu, food and the area the food comes from.  We went for sushi, but after Thomas explained the menu we realized we should be eating what the restaurant does best.  So glad that we did! Our server recommended we have 4-5 dishes for the two of us.  We went with every dish that he suggested. We had... *Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalepeno.  AMAZING.  This was my favorite dish of the night.  I want to eat it every day.  *Big Eye Tuna Tataki with Ponzu.  Delicious! *Black Cod with Miso.  Also amazing.  This was my second favorite.  Someone said it \"melted in my mouth\".  This is the perfect way to describe it.  Also, so flavorful! *Broiled Yellowtail Collar.  Delightful! *Mixed Seafood Ceviche.  My husband loved this, I thought it was just okay.  I think it was just my taste though, I don't love cucumbers or octopus.    Prices are high, but I definitely would recommend Nobu to anyone looking for an amazing meal.",

We dolled up, drove to the Hard Rock where there is valet parking, and walked into the center of the first floor where this ridiculously delicious restaurant is located.  Service-Great! Everyone was really attentive. I always had my water filled, any finished dishes cleared off within the minute. The food came in really good timing as well. I was starving going in and I didn't have to wait. Although coming from a restaurant like this I didn't expect anything less.  The decor is really comfy and not as fancy as I'd originally thought (or the other Nobu restaurants apparently). You can definitely get away with begin pretty casual or dressing up your attire. While there were only small groups there they had some large tables and some hidden rooms for even larger groups so if you need to bring a lot of people it seems as thought they'd be able to accommodate for more people.  Now onto the best part of all! Fooood is so worth the price!! Dessert: lemme start with this one because I cannot get over the delicious trio of soy caramel, miso apple cinnamon donuts and a really delicious HOME MADE ice cream with toasted pecans. Their pastry chef changes the dessert menu every season to go with what's in season which means I'm going to have to come here every season :)  Apart from that we enjoyed the black cod miso, eggplant miso (best i've ever had, decent portion but very rich), yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno (not spicy and very fresh!), japanese snapper dry miso (the garlic chips added great texture but the citrus oil sauce was too overpowering) and the shiitake mushroom salad (very strong citrus vinaigrette but delicious mushrooms to make up for it)  Awesome experience and a high price but definitely worth it :D",

In the nearly 3hrs that we remained there, Bijan created a multi-course meal specifically tailored to our food preferences and palates.   It wasn't just that every course blew our minds but that the service was so incredible. Its probably best to summarize that going to this Nobu is an experience that you will never forget.",

She looked around (the restaurant was about 10% filled) and hesitated, then said something along the lines of \"I suppose we can seat you anyway\"  Waiter: talked out of his ass. SERIOUSLY. This guy had no idea what he was saying!!! He tried to sound extremely educated in food once I told him I was a huge fan of Nobu and that I had all his cookbooks and loved them all. When describing the lobster risotto, he said \"and the way the chef prepares the risotto with the wakame and the seaweed....\" HI. wakame IS seaweed. \"the mirugai and the giant clam we call geoduck...\" HI. can you be any more redundant? Don't try to play fancy foreign word games with me like I have no clue what you're saying. I flashed my best smile everytime he came to word vomit. He had good intentions, but it was borderline offensive that he tried to add in japanese words as if we didn't know what they meant.  PROs: the staff is very attentive, very quick to remove finished plates so that the next course can be served. We never had to ask for a refill of water because of how attentive the wait staff was. The food was good, albiet pretentious... (I would never ever pay $30 for five paper-thin slices of hamachi with little slivers of jalapeno and overly acidic ponzu again), The menu was innovative, modern, and divided into clear categories to help you order a little bit of every category. The wait staff is very helpful with describing dishes, recommending dishes, and answering questions you have about the menu.  CONs: again, extremely frou frou Japnese food. The price is not reflective of the quality of food. $40 for a tiny amount of risotto served in a fancy big plate that looks like a bowl... PLEASE. The black cod was not fresh-- it seemed like the miso was attemting to cover up the slightly old taste of the black cod... The ceviche hurt my masseters. I probably made the ugliest little puckerface from the acid in the ceviche $35 tiny bowl of ceviche. I'm fine with paying good money for good food, but honestly, Nobu was a let down. If it's tiny portions, at least make them SPECTACULAR tiny portions. Spectacular it was not.  We left hungry, and went for a real dinner afterwards. Sorry, Nobu. Maybe we'll try another one of your restaurants, but definitely not Las Vegas.",

The only thing that was stellar was the Black cod lettuce wraps. If I was just giving a rating on the food, I would have given it a 3 or 4 star, but the service was horrible. We came in with drinks already in hand (thanks to Hard Rocks round bar), were served some bottled water, and many of us made a preemptive drink order. We were so happy we did, cause it was literally 30 minutes before we were served another drink. I would try to flag our server down, but I couldn't get him. During the night, the server was not engaging at all and rarely stopped to see how we were doing. To top it all off, since we were a party of 8, our tip was already added on to the bill. So, the despite being a horrible server, he still got a very hefty tip. On any other night I would have asked to speak to the manager, but I just let it go.

    "text": "If it were only about the sushi, Nobu would get 5 stars from me. But, I knock off 2 stars for service. We walked in on a Saturday night and got seats at the sushi bar, which is the place to be. We went with our sushi chef's suggestions, which were Nobu's house specialties, including \"new-style sashimi.\" These consist of the best fish, sashimi style, with delicate sauces and garnishes: yellowtail with jalapeno, live octopus with a Peruvian chili paste, whitefish and salmon with ponzu sauce, tuna with miso-mustard sauce. Everything was first-class, including the Junmai Daiginjo sake.  Then, I ordered the bento box chocolate cake dessert. We were told it would take 8 minutes to cook. No problem - our bellies were happily full of sashimi. 20 minutes later, however, still no dessert, and we finally were able to flag someone down to check on it. Another ten minutes went by. Our waiter then came out to tell us there was a mixup in the kitchen and our cake went to another table. He tried to give us a plateful of mochi ice cream to tide us over - this didn't go over well, as the last thing we wanted was to eat a plateful of mochi ice cream and then a chocolate cake. Another ten minutes or so, the dessert came out. It was excellent, but frankly wasn't worth waiting over half an hour for. We ask ed for the check while still eating...took another ten minutes...gave the credit card and another ten minutes went by...waiter came out to tell us the credit card isn't clearing and do we want to give another card? By this point, well over an hour had gone by since dessert was ordered and we just wanted to leave already.   When our check finally arrived, they did charge us for the dessert that took over 30 minutes to arrive at our table. When I mentioned this to the server, he took it right off the bill. But I was miffed that I even had to ask - the right thing to do would have been to take it off in the first place.  Too bad, since up until we ordered dessert we were very pleased with the sushi our wonderful chef served us. Even for a Saturday night in Vegas, the service was unacceptably unresponsive for such a high-end restaurant.",

    "text": "I wish all of my meals in Vegas were this good.  I don't even know where to begin.  The Yellow Tail sashimi with jalapeno that I was allowed to taste was delicious.  I could have ordered 5 plates of it alone and been happy with my meal.  Thankfully being with the group I was with that wasn't allowed to happen and I enjoyed several other items from the menu.  For myself I ordered the Chilean sea bass with a dry miso rub, the lobster ceviche, uni nigiri, and scallop sashimi.  The sea bass had a very mild flavor although the dry miso was tasty.  I think grilling sea bass rather than steaming it brings out the buttery flavor that it naturally has much better.  The lobster ceviche was great and I could have had a couple more but I held off so I could enjoy my entire meal.  The uni was good, although I don't think the wait staff would be able to tell you whether the uni is good that day or not if you asked.  I'm sure the people preparing the meals would just opt not to serve the uni if they happen to not be able to get some good stuff in that day.  At least I hope so.  The surprise of the meal was the scallop sashimi. It was presented beautifully in a little hollowed out lime cup.  With a dash of soy and wasabi the flavor was amazing.  I really should have gotten at least one more order.  I was also able to try some of the tempura rock shrimp, miso black cod, and the wagyu beef.  All were great but the wagyu beef and miso black cod were crazy delicious and will be must order items the next time I eat at Nobu.  For dessert I had the hibiscus sorbet with champagne jelly and rock candy.  The popping of the rock candy (pop rocks) in your mouth with the flavor of the hibiscus sorbet and champagne jelly was more fun than some of the Yelp events I've been to.",

    "text": "I don't even know why I'm writing this stupid review.  You're gonna go to Nobu regardless of what I write so why the heck am I even bothering?  Why are you going to go?  I'll give you 3 reasons:  1)  REASONABLY WELL PREPARED DISHES The fish is usually reasonably fresh because they crank out so much sushi nightly that every day new fish really has to be brought in.  The sauces used for any fish or meat dish are well balanced, savory, & time-tested - no need to worry about overly salty ponzu sauces or overbearingly sweet plum sauces.  A couple of key dishes to try, to experience what I'm talking about include: -- Toro Tartar in Ponzu:  The ponzu the toro floats in is deliciously well made & is practically sipable after finishing the fish & the accompanying American Sturgeon caviar.  The ponzu doesn't utterly overshadow the delectable saltiness of the caviar which is surprising. -- Kumamoto Oysters:  If you're one of those \"these shells are so small\" types, skip this dish.  This is for those that appreciate truly flavorful & tasty oysters - not beefy, characterless ones.  With these oysters, you can also appreciate the different sauce pairings the chef provides   2)  THE \"IN\" or \"COOL PLACE\" TO GO Guys - there's a lot of talent here so wear the good jeans.  Not that you're gonna hook up during your meal, but I'm just sayin' - it's doesn't hurt having legs-&-heels all around you.  Additionally, if you've got the coin & you come with your boys, passing plates around to try different dishes is cool.  As long as, again, you've got the coin because per person, this place is a good $100 easy so a group of 4 with sake can eclipse $500 after tip.    Ladies- you're gonna get a lot of looks here & that's even before the sake goggles go on so if you're at ease with yourself enough to admit being the attention whore that you are, you're gonna love every minute of it.  Men constantly trot over from one table to another to \"say hi\" & guys without both style & money rarely bother going to Nobu.  3)  CONVENIENT Goin' to a concert at the Joint?  Nobu's.  Goin' to Body English at 11PM?  Nobu's.  Gonna hang out at the Circle Bar?  Nobu's.  Gonna hit the tables later?  Nobu's.  Nobu's is the defacto restaurant to go to now that AJ's has shut down, Ago is kinda 'meh', & Pink Taco is better if you're just leisurely screwin' around.  WARNING #1:  NOBU'S SAKE LABEL For sake rookies, please read:  Unlike most sushi restaurants, Nobu only has available his own sake label.  The sake behind Nobu's is actually the product of the Hokusetsu brewery in Niigata prefecture Japan, a cold but famous region of Honshu known for making ultra-refined but sometimes 'water-ish' & unpronounced sake.  If you want to get the most value from your sake purchase, DO NOT purchase the \"YK35\" or even the \"YK50\" for consuming while eating your other dishes, unless you plan on having just straight nigiri & none of those 'hot dishes'.  The fact is that the sake is so light & minimal in character that you won't taste any of it over your \"ponzu-laden tuna tataki\" & you might as well get something with a more earthy nuance like the Hokusetsu Onigoroshi which is much cheaper & something you can appreciate the taste of with a flavorful meal.  WARNING #2:  TOURISTY BAMBOO SAKE DECANTERS For sake snobs:  They're gonna serve the sake in one of those novelty bamboo tokkuri by default.  Have them serve it in something else that's glass or ceramic.  Due to the porous/fiberous nature of the bamboo material, I don't believe these tokkuri get washed adequately & I've experienced very high variance - particularly in the nose - between YK35 served in the bamboo versus ceramic, for example.  WARNING #3:  GET RESERVATIONS Tips to the hostesses won't matter.  If they don't have room, they don't have room.  Not even your host is gonna be able to squeeze you & your boys in if there's no tables available.  WARNING #4:  OMAKASE DOESN'T MATTER If you actually know something about sushi, you'll agree:  The $150 Omakase at Nobu is really not that interesting or creative, nor is it that radically different from ordering  straight off the menu.  I've been going to Nobu for business dinners since before Simon was built across from it (which is now Ago) & contrary to what some other reviewers are raving about, there's VERY LITTLE that's innovative about Nobu's sushi or sashimi.  They might change up the fish in their sashimi tataki dishes or add some caviar here & there but at the end of the day, it's all the same - because the chef's don't have much time to care, & some of them actually aren't all that experienced.  CONCLUSION: As sushi-on/near-the-strip goes, this is about as good as it gets.  Other restaurants may try to clone Nobu's dishes (like the toro tartar) but very consistently, the quality of fish/balance in preparation is what shines through @ the original & you'll only learn this with experience so go ahead & try others.  You'll be back.  4-Stars.",

Fortunately, Asian pear bread pudding, with ginger ice cream and brandy-infused caramel sauce, ended the evening on a high note. Very expensive, so keep your fingers crossed that the cards are kind later in the night.",

    "text": "Nobu is my favorite Japanese restaurant.  Ever.  So far I've been to three- this one, Nobu Malibu and Nobu 57 in NY.  Out of the three, I'd have to say NY was the best and this one the least-best.  I say \"least best\" because \"worst\" and Nobu don't belong in the same sentence together.  You cant go wrong with Nobu- but I did have a few gripes about my most recent experience here a couple days ago.  So, of course of course you have to get the Miso Cod, obvie...not going to spend time describing how fabulous that dish is. In addition to the cod, I also ordered the lychee martini, the miso eggplant, the hearts of palm salad with \"jalapeno\" dressing and a miso soup.  If you've read my Nobu 57 review, you can see that the lychee martini I had was perfect (which is why I had 3), so understandably I was excited to have it again.  However, the one I received at Nobu Vegas was waaaaay to strong, and I had to request additional lychee juice to balance out the rubbing alcohol taste.  My other major gripe was the hearts of palm salad.  I specifically went out of my way to ask the server if this salad was the same hearts of palm salad with jalapeno dressing they serve at Nobu 57, and he assured me it was.  WRONG.  That salad that came out was repulsive- and pretty offensive because of the over-the-top garlic used.  It tasted nothing like the marvelous h.o.p. salad at Nobu 57.  And, they should call it \"blast of garlic dressing\" because after one bite I swear I smelled wretchedly of garlic for the rest of the night- and it wasn't spicy from the jalapeno at all.  Oh, and not to mention the fact that it was TWENTY DOLLARS.  Um, yea...skip that one.  The miso eggplant was good- not remarkable, but we did eat every last bit of it.  So, even with my complaints I still believe its a 4-star worthy establishment because every one of my previous experiences here have been amazing.  Maybe not as good as Nobu 57, but still the best Japanese restaraunt in Vegas, definitely.",

    "text": "Nobu.  Well, what can I say?  I've wanted to go to Nobu for a really, really long time.  Being in Vegas for the weekend, I decided this would be the time to do it.   We started with an assortment of sashimi.  Tuna, Mackerel (which was completely delicious) and a couple others .... my brain stopped operating clearly after the mackerel.  Then a large platter of raw Chilean sea bass with enoki and baby bok choy.  A warm ginger infused mushroom broth was ladled over the fish table side which cooked the melt-in-your mouth, luscious bass ever so gently.  MMMMMMM. Next came tempura King Crab legs with an accompanying  broth (which had sensational body) poured over the tempura right before eating.  It was amazing.  My husbands eyes rolled back into his head- I thought that he was having a seizure.  Then came the spicy tuna roll and eel and cucumber roll.  Both good.  But the item that stole the show had to be the uni.  And I mean in a bad way.  So I've never had uni.  I know that is super lame.  But I've been waiting until I was at a really good establishment because I wanted to be sure that I was getting the best uni prepared by competent hands.   My fantasy of being super cool vanished in a swift goopy instant.     EEEEEEWWWW. So it came pureed and then wrapped and tempura 'd.  Wow.  Well, having always prized myself on being somewhat of an adventurous eater I dove in head first, offering myself as the guinea pig.  Big mistake!  I take a bite.  The exterior is nice and crisp.  Within an instant my mouth was flooded with velvety toxic sea puke, orange ooze dripping on my plate below.  Maintaining composure was very difficult- however, this practice will come in handy once the check comes. -Abalone wasn't much more pleasant- similar flavor with the texture of chewing on somebody's ear. Thank god a clever distraction appeared soon thereafter the \"uni incident\".  Super thin slices of beautifully marbled raw Kobe beef on a large platter with six super hot rocks and an assortment of condiments and seasoning.  So we got to cook our own slices of Kobe using our chopsticks as our instruments on the hot rocks.  Can we say FUN?  I've always wanted to do that. Dessert sounded cool on the menu but in actuality it didn't taste too hot.  I did like the Shiso sorbet though.  The reason why I have given Nobu 4 stars instead of 5 is because the fact that I had to go to the skanky, garish, soulless, death trap that is Vegas in order to dine there and because of the price.  Even as I am writing this I cannot believe what I am about to say.  I am accustomed to spending 250$ or so on a nice dinner .  In this instance I was prepared to pay around 500-550$.  But for a party of four, with no alcohol bill to speak of and 2 people confessing that they were still hungry upon our exiting, the bill came to 700 big ones.  Ouch!  Gees- I have to confess feeling mildly nauseas directly afterward.  Am I just a cheap ol' broad?  Or have I gone and acquired some sort of conscience or something?  Something just felt really wrong about that.    I just feel like it was self indulgent and empty.  But, then again, I guess that pretty much sums up Vegas.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that I am a sushi FREAK. So you don't have to wonder, \"Hmm... maybe it was just her first time or....\" No. I seriously LIVE for sushi. I eat at incredible places about 3-4 times a MONTH! I dont care about cost either. Good sushi is worth it to me!   Okay, that being said... I would give Nobu a 3.5 stars if that were possible. Then again, the only reason I'd bring it up by half would be the friendly servers and great decor.   Now, for the sushi... like someone said below recently, I was expecting to be WOWED. I've eaten some amazing food in Vegas and hoped this was going to blow those other places out of the water. But this was not to be unfortunately. Now, I don't know if it's because we're more into nigiri & sashimi and we don't go the hot meal route very often. Either way, I was just not impressed. We ordered red snapper sashimi which came as big slabs of flavorless fish, no presentation & really no taste either. Next was spanish mackerel, usually my fave. This too was bland & boring. Then I ordered unagi, which as most sushi fans know takes a while to get to you when they bake it fresh. This was brought to me almost before the words came out of my mouth! Fast service yes... but how did he bake it so fast? I discovered the answer when I noticed a plateful of it sitting on top of the little oven already done & waiting. Boo!! This caused it to be lukewarm when it arrived. Finished off with rock shrimp tempura because at this point we really just wanted out of there realizing that if we saved up what money we'd normally spend, that we could go to one of our fave places soon to make up for it!   Rock shrimp tempura was good, I can't lie. But it was also nothing special. Oh!! And something that really bugged me & my dining partner was that the chef wasn't very good at making his rice stick together tight! It fell apart the second you touched it. :(   So to sum up...  1 point for service, 1 point for ambiance and 1 point for food/taste.I do have to say the the fish did taste fresh & the quality seemed safe & good. However,  will I go back? Ehh... I would if someone else was buying. But I will never seek it out on my own again I'm sad to say.",

A genuinely disappointing dinner.  The dishes showcased an exotic selection of fish.  However, the portions were exeptionally small.  And while I truly appreciate the fine-dining approach of quality over quantity, I feel that I shouldn't leave a $200 omakase meal feeling genuinely hungry.  The dishes themselves ranged in quality, but nothing was truly memorable - a shame for a place as esteemed as Nobu.  Service-wise, my impression was that our waiter was anxious to get off work and we inconvenienced him by trying to enjoy our meal.  He waiter made a point of repeatedly recommending items that \"came to the table quickly\".  His disappointment was evident when we ordered the long omakase menu and he said \"are you sure - that meal typically takes 2-hours?\".  His poor attitude continued throughout the night as he tossed the dishes on the table without explanation, served our paired flights well after the dishes were presented, and cleared our plates before we had finished chewinng.",

They gave us an alcohol menu only. Server finally came back and I told him \"I don't decide on my drink until I've picked out my meal.\" He told me that HE would help me decide on our food and drink pairing. I just needed to tell him what I like. Ok... so I told him what I normally order at Japanese restaurants. He then gave me a menu and never returned to our table.  FINALLY, another server came by and we told him that we were put-off by the previous server. This server was MUCH better, explains their cuisine, process, and answered questions.  Ambiance: 2/5 it's crazy loud in here. They have music blasting and there was a big party nearby. Tables are close together and it's a fairly small establishment. Imagine a diner with mood lighting, the waiters wear black, and the price of tempura is $40. That's Nobu.  Food: 2/5 blah at best. I've had better California rolls at Safeway. The vegetable tempura was bland. The $90 wine was just ok. The seafood wasn't fresh. We were told by server #1 that it was family style, but the food was not served that way. The best thing I ate was the crispy spinach... that was good.  Price: $$$$$. I don't mind paying for a nice meal but this was not it.",

Tara and Thom ordered the $125 \"Nobu Signatures\" that's where our server asked some questions and proceeded to bring them smaller servings of (some of their) Signature dishes.  First for them. Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno* (and recommended cilantro leaves). I stole a piece and OMG!!  I lost track of some, but another highlight was Pepper Crusted Black Cod. I've never liked cod before, but this was special. The char was perfect. I had the best mushroom soup and Tenderloin of Beef* cooked perfectly. Eating pre-sliced steak with chop sticks is classy.  Anne had the Organic Chicken and we both chose the Anticucho sauce as the marinade. Stick licking good.  Bottom line is this place is Fantastic. The service is exceptional. A swarm of friendly team players keep you over satisfied. We had a meal that we will never forget with great friends.   Thank you Nobu",

My favorite out of all (but don't get me wrong I absolutely LOVED all if anything everything were my favorites lol) was the Japanese Snapper with their special sauce? Im not sure if it was dry miso or not. But it was a different sauce that mixed so well with the japanese snapper! The crunchy addition was a perfect touch! The yellow tail, salmon, scallop, and tuna sushis were all in one plate including the sauce. The sauce was the perfect sauce for the sushi! The rock shrimp tempura was amazing! No extra sauce needed! My partner absolutely loved this dish! The black cod miso --where do I start? It was cooked so perfectly. Not overcooked, not undercooked. When I say perfectly cooked this is what cooking is supposed to be like. It seemed like it it was taken out of the pan at the exact perfect second! The bento box dessert loved the matcha gelato sooooo good! The chocolate was great, love dark chocolate! If you're more for the sweet chocolate you can also mix the matcha gelato with the dark chocolate which is what my partner. Expect to pay about 200-250 including tip though for all these, but it is sooo worth it! Ahhhh it was so good, I'm thinking of going back before we leave vegas!",

Had a good (overpriced) cocktail at the bar, then we were seated at possibly the worst table in the place, despite our months-early reservation. Got a booth back by the server pow-wow area / cash register, next to a massive table of really drunk and really loud patrons. Ok, fine. Ordered many dishes, including small plates, entrees, sushi rolls, etc. My father makes it clear to the waiter he doesn't like mushrooms (this is pertinent later).   Our 3 tacos come out - $34 worth of tacos - and they are the SMALLEST, most laughable portion size ever. I literally laughed out loud when they put them down. They were no bigger than lime wedges (I posted a photo). Very good, but ridiculously priced and sized. Ok, fine.  The other dishes start to come out, and they're timed terribly. Sushi after entrees, entrees at different times...I ate alone basically while my companions looked on, waiting for their food. My father's entree comes out and it's the WRONG one. Finally, when his actual dinner arrives, it's covered in mushrooms. The waiter never mentioned that could be a problem when my father placed his order, and the menu mentioned nothing about mushrooms. Ok, fine.  My husband's $80 sashimi chef's special comes out and it's also laughably undersized. Literally 9 pieces of fish for $80. When we go to Morimoto in Philadelphia, a $50 sashimi plate has easily 3x the amount of fish on it. Same quality. I get that it's Vegas but this was a joke. The waiter never explained what fish were on the plate either - just left my husband to guess. This was the last straw.  Overall the food is fine, but there are so many other places that serve comparable stuff at way better prices. Nobu is nothing special. I hope for the sake of other diners my experience is not typical, but it was enough to burn this frequent Vegas traveler. I will not be back.",

The location is a bit hidden within the Hard Rock since the signage blends in, but it's right next to Culinary Dropout. Once you get inside the dining room is lively and bright. I would have liked the lighting to be a bit more dim to make the mood somewhat more intimate, but either way it was enjoyable.   The dining experience was unique and like nothing I've personally done before. Our waiter asked us what our favorite flavors were, what our plans were for the night, if we had any allergies or diet restrictions and what our budget was per person. From there, he would bring out dishes for us almost as a surprise. I really enjoyed this since it forced us to try new things we might not have originally ordered and it was exciting to see what would be next.   Some of my favorite items from the night were the Tasmanian Ocean Trout Pan Roasted and the Salmon Belly in a mustard sauce. Both of these dishes were 5/5 for me. They were cooked/prepared perfectly and the flavors were outstanding. I also enjoyed the Yellowtail Sashimi and Rock Shrimp, these were 4/5 for me.   This place was excellent from the food to the house exclusive Sake to the outstanding service from all staff members we encountered. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others for an epic date night or birthday celebration.",

    "text": "Overview: Amazing food, great service, but overpriced.   The low down: Came on a weekday, and was looking for some tasty sushi. I was staying at the Hard Rock, so having great sushi just downstairs was perfect.   I got seated at the bar, since I was alone, and sitting by the Sushi Chefs is the best way to have the sushi experience. I started my relaxing evening with some Sake, the Nobu Junmai Ginjo 71. One of the smoothest sake's I have had. It was delicious and fruity. I will definitely be having this again in the future.   It took me a while to decide what I wanted to do for food. First off, I am new to this Gluten Free lifestyle, and sushi is usually pretty good for me, since I just want raw fish. However, they put gluten in a bunch of their dishes, but they were beyond accommodating. Between my Waiter and the Sushi Chef, Hieu, they were ready to make anything gluten free. He even accommodated my no Cilantro issue as well. Usually when I go to sushi places, I get an Omakase and it's gentle pairings of sushi with seasonings or sauces. I am not used to sauces being on almost everything, so I actually felt it was a little difficult to order and decide what I wanted. The menu had a lot of spicy things, as well as cilantro, so navigating those things was almost more tough than the gluten thing. Anyways, I ended up with a raw scallop, some new style sashimi, and Tai with dry miso. I cannot say enough good things about Hieu, who got what I wanted immediately and I pretty much differed to him for all my sushi orders. If I come again, I will try the Omakase.   Overall, amazing sushi, just definitely overpriced. I go to a lot of great sushi places, and order Omakase, but this was a little overboard. I know it's in Vegas, but it's actually off the strip, so I except a tiny bit more decently priced things. I did go in knowing the prices, so I can't fault them for it too much.",

Made a reservation the night before and was delighted to have a reservation for 3 accommodated at a reasonable time for dinner. Winning!  Our waiter was one of the best servers we've ever had. He created a custom vegan tasting menu for me, and it was fantastic (and not too expensive, either!). Each dish was chosen for a reason and our waiter explained all the ingredients as well as how the food was prepared. Tofu skins in a sesame vinagerette. Mushrooms and sake sizzling in a iron pan on the table. Avocado prepared like raw fish. It was all so good! The dessert was also to die for! Shaved ice with mango sorbet, fresh fruit, coconut cream and chili powder. Mmmm! So original but the flavors were still somehow so familiar. The pace of the meal was just right and we didn't feel rushed at all: we just felt well taken care of.  In the end, we spent about $200 per person for drinks AND food (including dessert and tip). It was well worth it!  DO IT!",

The customer service, quality of food, variety in offerings, the speed and attention of the service, to the chefs (sushi line) being able to make surprise custom dishes on the fly with just being told what you're interested in, honestly this place can do no wrong. Make reservations early, or try to walk up and grab a seat at the bar area. The service isn't lacking if you're not a table, trust me. While the price is on the higher side, you get what you pay for. From the ambiance, professional customer service, and overall spread, it's well worth it. At least go once, especially if you're staying or running through Caesars Palace.",

    "text": "Not about to question the historical significance of Nobuyuki Matsuhisa or Nobu Restaurant's role in popularizing Sushi across the globe it was with some trepidation and also wonder about how the concept had aged that dinner was booked Saturday evening inside The Hard Rock Hotel & Casino, the answer precisely as expected and whether that is a \"good\" or bad thing difficult to unravel.  A \"best new Restaurant\" winner in 1995 and now with a worldwide empire including hotels such as the boutique piece of Caesars' and its first floor eatery, it was in 2007 that Nobu TriBeCa was first experienced, memories undoubtedly faded since but the overall theme recalled to be disinterested service and high prices for not much Food and a look at the current menu shows the latter to have only grown more ridiculous, $20 for two King Crab Tacos compared to $18 for three topped with Lobster in the past but one example.  Allowing for inflation but hoping service would perhaps show the level of care Las Vegas has proven capable of in other Celebrity Chef offshoots, personal support of The Hard Rock and its eateries as frequently being far better than most give them credit for aside, it was after navigating a floor of folks in town for Psychofest that the Restaurant was located and reservations confirmed, the fact that the room was completely full not entirely surprising though the range of patrons from dolled-up bachelorettes to guys with well over fifty visible tattoos was certainly interesting.  Predictably employing a pretty staff to work below moody-lighting and thumping bass, Nobu's look always photogenic even in the days before Instagram, it was after passing on the bottled water and Sake up-sell that the server inquired whether guests were interested in seeing the menu or allowing for Chef's Choice, a \"variety of price points\" ranging from $80 to $200 described and $100 settled on as a number though this certainly is not Omakase.  Truly an odd manner of ordering, the Chefs entirely removed from the decision making and this tasting instead crafted by a server who simply chooses items a la carte and builds a running tally of which guests are reminded as though participating some sort of monetary 'race,' it was with nine thin slices of slightly snappy White Fish for $25 that dinner got started, a touch of Aji Pepper adding heat but the Fish's quality likely no better than what one might find at a place advertising \"All you can eat.\"  Next presenting an equal portion of Salmon at the same price per slice, the aforementioned \"race\" sure to be a sprint instead of marathon, it seems Nobu's idea of \"New\" still inhabits an era pre-Millennium as a flood of Ponzu and Sesame plus one peeled Tomato hardly looks novel while thoroughly obscuring the fish's flavor, the aforementioned Tacos offered next at least showcasing their ingredients, though considering the $9-10 per bite cost one would be better off simply adding more Nigiri, albeit only slightly.  Dropping a $28 bowl of lightly heated Rock Shrimp Tempura next, the Crustaceans themselves at best U-30 and in no way superior to those found on the A.Y.C.E. Buffet at The Palms, it was from a young female server supporting a large Lobster dish in her other hand that Nobu's famous Miso Sea Bass was soon 'presented,' little more than \"eat the Ginger last to cleanse the palate\" stated as she scampered off and the $40 filet with a $2 surcharge for \"Dry Miso Style\" still quite good but certainly not as special as when it debuted nearly twenty-five years ago.  Adding insult to injury with a $12 California Roll and Nigiri featuring over-sweetened and mushy Rice below $6 slices of average Albacore and Fluke, it was finally copping Michel Bras' 1981 recipe for \"Lava Cake\" that dinner came to an end, the Chocolate undoubtedly of good quality as was the bitter-sweet Gelato but the $260 tab more a reminder of precisely why Nobu is rich than a justifiable expense to sit in a \"cool\" place eating below-average Food.  ONE AND A HALF STARS:  No doubt making a mistake in ordering pseudo-Chef's Choice, a server barely old enough to drink and his staff of runners who could care less about things like empty water glasses or lingering dirty plates hardly someone to trust as there is no monetary \"value\" in the Tasting versus ordering a la carte, one must thank Chef Matsuhisa for his contributions and ability to both build and maintain an empire, though for discerning diners there is nothing to see here and there has not been for years.",

This place is INSANELY PRICY for what you get, which is why I rated it so low, star wise. What's funny though is our server (who was pretty awesome) told us that the dishes were \"family style\" and so big people could share. UHHH, on what planet?! The portions were TINY AF, and we left starving after spending $250 on.... 6 things? Ugh.   As for how the food tasted... Meh. Nothing to get up from the table and start dancing about. I asked for no sauces on things but ALAS they all came with sauces (minus my sea trout, which was cooked very well, and the crispy spinach was tasty AF). I really wanted more food when I was done eating but my shell shock in terms of price told me to not bother!   I will NEVER go back to any NOBU ever. Not worth my wallet losing weight over at all (and that's saying something for me because I have ZERO PROBLEM spending money on food!).",

    "text": "Fantastic overall dining experience. The sushi chefs and staff were friendly and simply superb.   Had to check the Nobu Omakase off my foodie bucket list. The cooks pointed me towards the seasonal version which focuses more on fish and their specific specialties. As their signature version is in the more broad Nobu chain specialties.   Only picture I forgot to take was the assortment of nigiri because it simply looked so good that I just dug in. The sushi and sashimi were so delicate and delicious as expected. A5 wagyu doesn't need any introduction, they provided a hot stone to cook the wagyu to your liking.   The dish that surprised the most was the scallop dish. The sweetness of the glaze with the fatty foie gras and salty roe and slight bitterness of asparagus provided the perfectly balanced bite.  If you are able to splurge a little bit this was a excellent way to tease the palate.",

Perhaps it was chef's off day or the products have not been renewed lately, but the sushi was simply atrocious for the price paid. The fish was not fresh (e.g., the scallops smelled fishy, which they shouldn't, the tuna was very chewy, the mackerel was old, etc.). The rice was not seasoned properly and was bland in taste. There were none to minimal toppings offered. Salmon hand roll was ok (hard to spoil salmon) but was held at the chef station for a bit too long, and as a result, the seaweed started to become soggy. Additionally, sake was served in wine glasses.   All in all, not a good value for money. Perhaps dishes other than sushi fare better. Did not ask for the dessert menu, as the disappointment from the sushi was too deep.",

    "text": "Nobu participated in Restaurant Week, and this was what got me in the door.  I knew it was a pricey Sushi place, so I always hesitated in going since there are so many off-strip Sushi joints near my home that are great and less expensive.  But the pricey-ness will deter me no more! I was very impressed with the service, quality of food and the Sake selection.    Some of the food items we ordered from the RW tasting menu were better than others.  Our clear, hands-down favorites were the Black Cod lettuce wraps, Scallop rolls, Beef tenderloin and the 2 desserts - Suntory Cappuccino and the White Chocolate Pot de Creme.  I'd go back for the Black Cod lettuce wraps alone.   They were sublime... absolutely melted in your mouth with a nice crunch and freshness from the baby butter lettuce that it was served in.  Mind you, you have to like fish because Black Cod does have a noticeable but pleasant fish oiliness to it... but it's so delicate and lovely that you just want more, more, more!  The most surprising dish was the Scallop roll.  I've had Scallop rolls in the past at other restaurants... but this was by far better than anything I've ever had.  This too melted in your mouth. It wasn't squishy but it wasn't chewy either.  It was the perfect, bite-size, morsel of yumminess.  The tenderloin... was tender and perfectly prepared... juicy with a slight sear.  We were not expected to be blown away by the desserts... in fact, I'm usually underwhelmed and don't normally order desserts at restaurants, but they were part of the RW menu so obviously we indulged.  I'm REALLY glad it was include in the RW menu!  They were desserts... so Yea... they were sweet, but they were not sugary-syrupy-sweet.  The \"cappuccino\" was not a drink... it was like a tiramisu but not.  I mean... it had layers like a tiramisu... where the bottom was a rich (but not too intense) dark chocolate cookie crust and then a layer of milk chocolate creme that was topped with a heavenly layer of whipped / airy whiskey foam.  And the White Chocolate Pot de Creme ... don't read the description as it really doesn't do it justice. Just trust me and the Amazing chefs at Nobu... this dessert is worth all the calories!  Light and Summery!  It's a complex white chocolate mousse with fresh citrus bits.  I know... that's not a great description but seriously... this is something to experience and savor each small spoonful slowly so that it lasts as long as possible until you are licking the dish. (I may or may not have done that. ha!) Troy (our server) was Fantastic! And helped us pick out a Sake to accompany our dinner. It was flavorful on its own, yet complimented our entire meal.   The food runners who present your dishes.... and YES, they present them to you... were wonderful and polite.  They position them before you and explain it before departing.  It's so nice to have your various courses presented to you and an explanation of how it was prepared and what's in it. And I'm so happy to learn that they will continue operating under the new Virgin hotel that will be taking over the Hard Rock. Net, Net .... we will be back!",

For dessert, the white chocolate pot de creme was creamy and delicious.   In addition to the food, the staff was attentive without being overbearing. They explained each dish as they brought them out and were polite and knowledgeable.  This was definitely a highlight of our trip to Vegas.",

    "text": "I ate here this past Tuesday night.  I sat at the bar and had a drink and some food.  I knew Nobu already from NY and so I knew what to expect.  It's twice as expensive as other expensive sushi places.  The price of a piece of nigiri is the same as other expensive places, but you get one, not two pieces.  That's fine -- I knew to expect that.  I ordered a Yamazaki scotch.  I knew it was $80 and it was fine.  Then I ordered some sushi.  Salmon, hamachi, uni, a few others -- all nigiri.  As I waited I poured some soy sauce into my bowl.  There was a bright light shining down and because of that I could see little fluffies floating in the sauce -- probably from a napkin that dried the bowl.  It wasn't dirty, but there were little pieces of lint.  I pointed it out and the bartender and the (I think) manager were great -- they took the bowl, brought another bowl, and poured fresh soy sauce.  The bowl was like a rice bowl full of soy sauce -- very large -- which made mixing wasabi into it a little challenging.  I thought that was odd.  Then the sushi arrived.  It's not that the sushi was bad.  I ate it and it was fine.  But unlike all good sushi I have had, it had kind of a dry texture to it -- like it was not super fresh.  I would have been disappointed in the sushi at any restaurant -- even a low end neighborhood joint.  But at Nobu where everything costs double, I was disappointed and frankly surprised that the fish was plated by the chef and served by the servers.  Again, somewhere else, maybe, but not at Nobu.  My tab (I was alone) was $287.48 including tip.  I expected that, but not the sushi quality.  Not worth the price, not worth half the price.",

It looked so nice and classy from outside, inside it was even better! They had these cute lighting hanging from the ceiling that doubled as a sound barrier and looked like floating clouds. It seemed noisy but it wasn't? Like you can tell there was a lot going on, but once seated we were like in our own bubble we could hear each other perfectly without having to get loud. The staff was ALL so nice, several people helped us and no one gave us that awkward feeling. I really have no idea what my sisters ordered so I can't be specific sorry. But I can definitely tell y'all EVERYTHING was so delicious! It was as wonderful as it looks! I cannot wait to come back one day!!! Everything was FRESH and seasoned to perfection!",

The three of us shared a bamboo sake order, many many appetizers, one main course, and a green tea ice cream.  I was surprised that it was under $300, and we were stuffed AND satisfied.  The lobster salad was great; you really do get an entire lobster!  The only thing we didn't love was the squid pasta salad, but it was still decent.  I was a little disappointed that for the prices we're paying, we still weren't getting real wasabi.  The service was great despite how busy it was.  I had reserved 9 days in advance but still could only get a 10pm reservation.  I was concerned that the service, selection, and quality wouldn't be up to par since the kitchen supposedly closed at 11pm, but this was not the case.  I *loved* the filet mignon with anticucho sauce, but the southerner in our group thought it tasted like weird chili.  I'd give this more like a 4.5 stars.  I really didn't like the Hard Rock Hotel, and once you step out of the restaurant, it's just way too loud, even for Vegas.",

Had a couple martini's and had a shot of this unbelievable tequila called Deleon.  Very smooth and unique.  Expensive but we were celebrating so very worth it.

Various intricate, colorful, and tasty dishes appear one after another.  The Kobe beef and foie gras was the high-light.  I was so surprised that I was actually getting full.  But for $125, I shouldn't expect any less.  There was this nice couple sitting in the next table.  They shared their black cod on lettuce cups dish with me because they ordered too much food.  That dish was excellent.  If only that can happen more often.    As everyone says, it is strange to be located in Hard Rock Casino.  It is not on the strip, so not as convenient to get to.  The decor seemed a little off - feels more Hawaiian or tropical.  The service was friendly, and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.",

And my new pet peeve - DO NOT wipe the table down to prep for the next customer while I am still sitting at the table waiting for my check.  Clearing the table is fine, but seriously?  It's completely RUDE and I think after we dropped $200.00 and only took up about 45 minutes of their time, they could have waited- especially since there were plenty of empty tables around us.

Close to 9:00pm now - food begins to come out...  Ceviche - way too fishy Black cod with miso - Good, but I would rather it cut off a bit of the sweetness Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno - delicieux Edamame - the usual  Then 7 rolls came out - nothing special...was told \"This is all, did you want anything else?\" No.  Very dissatisfied to the point where there were still plenty of rolls left on the plate.  Finally, one of the guys remembered we ordered a Kobe Beef Teriyaki...It never came.  We notified two guys and finally when we wanted to pay for the bill and just go home. They brought it out.    Sorry to say, a bit of my distaste came out.  It's my cousin/best friend's birthday dinner and it was a disaster.  We sent back the teriyaki and wanted to leave ASAP after the bill came.    The 3rd star is for the waiter's apology and help with the bill.  It was nice that they made an effort after the shortcomings.  The place wasn't packed, maybe it was an off day.    Hopefully, if I return, my next experience will be much better.",

Had edamame to start - a good primer. Then yellowtail sashimi with jalapenos and a special soy sauce - oh my goodness my favorite dish. I don't even like sashimi. Then a huge California roll and tons of nigri - best I've ever had. Then this crazy shrimp tempura with the greatest sauce ever over a bed of lettuce with my best - tasting dressing that complimented it so well - like fireworks in your mouth. Very filling. Then this fish. Alaskan cod. I thought there was a party in my mouth - cooked absolutely perfectly it melted in your mouth and left you feeling completely satisfied. Dessert was insane. You just have to experience it.",

Just stick with the specialty items, sashimi and nigiri sushi and you shall be alright. The sake is OK just be careful because alcohol could end up doubling your bill.

    "text": "the visit was on a labor day sunday around 6pm.  the last visit to this particular nobu was back in 2003 when i didn't know the difference between a piece of foie and a rubber sole.  i recall having the chef special back then as well, but the omakase this time was definitely more enjoyable.  this was probably due to the fact that i wasn't three sheets to the wind this time.  being married does these things.  there were those that chose the bronze omakase ($100) and those that went for the silver ($150) like yours truly, and boy was there ever a difference.  there were major discrepancies between the cuts and also the types of meats served.  the sashimi and the speciality dishes also had noticeable differences.  it's not to say that the 100 dollar omakase wasn't good, but it wasn't great...at least from my vantage point.  there's about a zillion details i will be leaving out, such as the dried flakes of hoo-haa sprinkled with a drizzle of the thinger thang.  So use your imagination..  course 1 - a bonito sashimi. course 2 - amaebi splashed with hot oil, chawan mushi with truffle and crab eggs at the bottom, kampachi sashimi with dried miso flakes. course 3 - toro sashimi with ponzu ginger sauce and jalapeno sauce topped with a bunch of edible flowers which made it all purdy and crap. course 4 - seared scallops on a bed of sea beans. course 5 - kobe beef (served medium) with pan fried foie gras. course 6 - sushi set (nigiri) with lobster broth and lobster chunks.  the set consisted of - toro, abalone, spanish mackerel, eel, tai (red snapper) and tamago. course 7 - an array of sweets including mochi ice cream, chocolate looking souffle thing, fresh fruits and other sugary confections we couldn't stay for because we were already late for the friggin cirque du pouffay show.  ..  all in all, a great meal.  i enjoyed the silver omakase at matsuhisa better, the wife liked this dinner much better.  definitely a strong 4 star, but nowhere near a five.  the highlight of the meal for me was the foie served over the kobe.  the dish was so luxurious i really was at a loss for words as i was enjoying every delectable bite.  the slice of black truffle in the chawan mushi gives you a big mule kick in the face which was in short, heavenly.    i was surprised to find that i liked the non sushi dishes better than the raw, but is it such a huge surprise?  we live in cities like LA, SF, NY, etc. where quality ingredients are so readily available.  i've had sashimi as good if not better in other restaurants.  most don't serve it with the detail and ingenuity like mr. nobu matsuhisa, but it takes way too much money to surprise this sushi cowboy.  i truly don't mean to sound snobbish, but there's only so many ways to serve up a nice slab of toro.  i'm more impressed these days by the way chefs serve up foie.  and i am TOTALLY infatuated with bone marrow.  ..  i've said too much.    i am off to eat.  EDIT:  i don't know if it was because we were in vegas, but i felt like everything was a bit contrived.  *shrugs*",

This was the first restaurant we chose to dine at.  First off it's at the Hard Rock Hotel.  I don't like this place one bit.  It's over rated and think Nobu doesn't fit in this environment of tacky rock n roll memoriabilia minus Nirvana.    OK we go in and get drinks first at the bar.  Salty Dogs are great and they make it damn good at Nobu.   We get seated 20 minutes later even with reservations, this place gets busy.  Our server comes and asks us what we would like to order.  We pretty much had the chef's tasting menu and we're glad we did.  First course- Spicy Tuna and I think Dragon Roll- it was good, but come on I can getthose rolls anywhere, give me something interesting!  Second course- Tempura Rock Shrimp with Spicy Aioli and Tempura Vegetables with Soy Glaze.  Very good and for how simple it looked the sauces made it very complex.   Third Course- Yellowtail with Jalepeno and Citrus Ponzu- AMAZING!  So damn good I would have eaten just that and be satisfied.  Pepper Seared Rare Ahi with Chili Vinegar Sauce- Again give me a plate of this and I would die a happy man.  Fourth Course- Miso Marinated Cod- This is by far the best seafood dish I have ever tried.  The fish was so tender, and the skin was crisp and flavorful!  Simply heaven.   Fifth Course- Trio of Sorbets  I must say the food was great minus the first course!  Spicy Tuna and Dragon Roll at a high end Japanese Restaurant?  I don't know for a tab of $400.00 for 4 people I think that Spicy Tuna is not needed!",

I enjoyed an arrangement of raw shellfish centered around a solid brick of Himilayan rock salt.  The instructions were to place the fish on the salt for a couple of seconds, then remove and eat.  I have seen this on Iron Chef, and the result was quite tasty.  Uni was nice, o-toro was very high quality but the winner of the evening was the yellowtail collar, which I am not sure was on the menu.  The collar is just fantastically flavorful.  I did not see the bill (it was a business dinner) but I assume it was a bit over the top.  Nonetheless, I love being able to stumble out of Nobu and head to the Hard Rock bar to drink more.",

My friend is a big Nobu fan as well, and we were both disappointed with our experience this trip to Vegas.  What was great about the service - that they brought the dish, explained it and then left us alone to enjoy food w/o constantly checking in w/ us - also turned out to be an issue.  When we were ready to order more sake, we waited over 15 minutes, and, when no server had come to our table, my friend got up and found one to take our order.  The food this time was also a disappointment.  The rock shrimp tempura wasn't as tastey as always, and the sushi rolls were just ordinary.  Certainly not good enough for Nobu prices.  The Miso Cod and Yellow Tail Sashimi were both delicious, but the others were sub-par for Nobu's reputation.  Sometimes, I'm not sure it's a good thing to have all the big name restaurants in Vegas... if the big name chefs are elsewhere, the Vegas fare seems to suffer.",

I am a person who likes to consider myself a huge food critic and fanatic, and was repulsed by my meal at Nobu in Vegas.  First, we tried the restaurants \"most popular cold dish\" the yellow tail with jalapeno.  It was saturated in soy sauce with a splash of rice vinegar. How is that in any way shape or form a dish worthy of being proclaimed a restaurant favorite. My 2 year old niece could have whooped up that concoction in her plastic kitchen.  As someone who is considered a culinary marvel by many of her friends, that was such an insult to my palate and my wallet.  Next, the toban yaki was so repulsive, I couldn't honestly finish my meal. There were two shiitake mushrooms, 2 pieces of shrimp, 1 scallop, and 2 pieces of calamari  in a hot pot drenched in sake with a pinch of brown sugar, rice vinegar, and soy sauce. WOW it tasted like the essence of Lysol. There were no complicated flavors and the presentation was so amateur, I felt utterly pissed that we trekked down to the Hard Rock for a meal unworthy of Benihanas...yes please note the sarcasm.  Finally, they brought out the beef tenderloin...my God it was at that point that we asked him to forget about our sushi and the rest of the meal, paid for the check, and walked out. They took a delicious, beautiful piece of tenderloin and threw it into a hot pot with the same horrid sake, soy sauce concoction as the seafood travesty.  Take it from someone who LOVES and ENJOYS fine dining to the highest degree - this place was horrendous! I give it 1 star because I have to actually rate it with something. I will never eat at another Nobu establishment for the rest of my life...and unless you feel like sitting in a loud club with layered seating, amateur service and food, head to one of the better fine dining establishments on the strip. I hear McDonalds makes a mean Big Mac.",

Yes, it was ultra modern, and a bit too dimly lit, and we WERE sitting behind an obnoxiously loud newlewed couple (she was still in her white wedding dress, spilling drinks, and talking loudly to her neighbors!) there were no restrooms (had to leave the restaurant) but all in all- this was a five star meal (in blinging bright Vegas styled neon lights-flashing!!) if there ever was one. And I am changed, as a result of this.  We decided to throw caution (and ugly thoughts of the recession) out the window and opted for the 150/head omakase. I kid you not, better, smoother, fresher, more buttery, more beautifully presented than I've had in Japan! Now, I don't remember all the individual dishes but I recalled that we were transformed into two little kids in a candy store, sitting there smiling in awe at what just went into our mouths and rubbing our hands together in astonished anticipation of just WHAT could top what we had just tasted? On and on... the dishes came. Beautiful and perfect, each shining in it's own vibrant manner, beautifully crafted and thought-provoking. Perfectly portioned... perfectly perfect.  The yellowtail with a slim sliver of jalepeno was awesome- my bf's pick of the night. The chilean sea bass divine. The trout with that sweet citrus.. the hamachi w/garganzola and balsamic- so unreal. The fois gras was smoother than butter. Everything just melted.  I'm not sure whether it had anything to do with shelling out SO much money but Nobu had just turned dinner into a culinary experience for us. A masterpiece. And once we've tasted greatness.... it's so hard to go back.",

    "text": "When Nobu opened in New York City, it created a sensation.  Reservations were nearly impossible to get, and its new interpretation of traditional Japanese food was widely praised.  This led to the inevitable branding of the restaurant; Nobu can be found all over the globe.  Meal #1: I found Las Vegas Nobu's sushi highly variable.  The overall quality was OK, but some items (e.g., uni) were poor while others (e.g., ankimo) were good.  Orange and honey flavored sake was interesting but probably not worth repeating.  Meal #2:  Since my first meal, I went to Nobu in Miami Beach, sat in the dining room and had the omakase meal.  I enjoyed that a bit more, so decided to give the Vegas location another shot.  The restaurant looks OK, but nothing great.  It's very noisy, in keeping with the Hard Rock atmosphere.  The crowd is mostly young, but I think anyone would feel comfortable here; I did.  Service is pleasant, although all the servers are running around at full speed.  Now, on to the meal:      * I chose Jyunmai Daiginjyo sake.  It wasn't bad, but was a trifle harsh.     * Small Japanese spring roll with balsamic vinaigrette reduction.  Good.     * Trio of raw seafood: sea scallop slice, oyster, ama ebi (raw shrimp).  All served with onion and other spices, although each was slightly different.  Good.     * Seared maguro and a slightly strong flavored fish, with garlic chips and a pickled ginger shoot.  A good combination.  Very good.     * Uni (sea urchin) and some white fish, served on sliced eggplant.  The uni was seared and was surprisingly delicious.  There was also a tiny river crab, to be eaten shell and all; interesting for the crunch, not the flavor.  Very good.     * O toro and a spring roll with Jalapeno sauce and radish.  The o toro was good but a little chewy, and the strong sauce tended to overwhelm the tuna.  Good to very good.     * Palate cleanser: intensely flavored, sweet/sour mango sorbet, on top of a red granite with little flavor.     * Service lapse.  Up to this point, courses had been timed well.  At this point, I waited for about 15 minutes, with no explanation.  This was a little annoying.     * Grilled sea scallop on a bed of mushrooms, bits of seafood, and brown rice.  Very good.     * Foie gras and Kobe beef.  A large hunk of foie gras; good flavor.  Kobe beef very good.  Overall, very good to excellent.     * Service lapse: the next course was supposed to be sushi, followed by miso soup.  They reversed the order, and apologized later.  A minor matter.     * Miso soup.  Better than average; good fish stock flavor, not too salty.  Very good.     * Sushi: o-toro (tuna belly), shima aji (variety of mackerel?), some kind of crab, unagi (eel).  Very good.     * Fruit papillote.  Like a crepe.  The raspberry seeds were very distracting.  Fair.     * Honey ice cream.  Very strong honey flavor.  Strange, but I liked it.  Very good.  Overall, the meal was good, but not as good as Nobu in Miami, and not nearly as good as Okada.  At the price they charge ($120), they need to do better.  Meal #3: Based on past meals, I hadn't planned to return. However, I found myself at The Hard Rock Hotel at meal time, and no other choices looked appealing. I decided to go for unusual choices, hoping this would be a strength. This worked out better. My selections:      * Ankimo (steamed monkfish liver). Standard but still very good.     * Hamachi kama (grilled yellowtail collar). This is a chunk of fish, skin and bone, served grilled. It may not sound like much, and it's a little difficult to get the flesh out, but it's usually very rich and very tasty. I was both happy and sad with my choice: it was very good, but not as good as elsewhere. If you'd like to try this dish, order it robatayaki style at Okada.     * Live shrimp. These Santa Barbara shrimp were killed in front of me, so I guess that means they're fresh. They were big and rather chewy; I'm guessing the latter is due to their recent demise. The heads were served tempura style, and were juicy and tasty.     * Live octopus. I'm not sure that it was live, but slices of the tentacle, served raw, were indeed very fresh tasting - and much less chewy than the cooked version. Pretty good.  This was the most satisfying of my meals at Nobu. Nothing was stellar, but everything was good.  Nobu's strength is its new take on Japanese foods.  Its weaknesses are sushi that isn't in the same class with the better places in Las Vegas, and suspect service.  Given such high prices, I'd look elsewhere.",

    "text": "Very good place if you are into sushi with a flare of fusion. Very trendy, a little too small in my opinion, but well worth it if you have a couple of bills to burn. Decor was your typical hip sushi joint. Dark subtle tones, nice dishes, pebbles to lay your chopsticks, and bamboo decorated everywhere. Service was awesome as they were very friendly, attentive, and informative. The servers went into great detail of each dish that we asked about, how the fish is cut/prepared, cooked, marinated, blah blah blah. My favorite dishes here were the chilean sea bass over buttered lettuce, and the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno. A table next to us ordered rock shrimp tempura in a spicy sauce, so being the food envious kind of guy I am, I ordered one for our table...unfortunately it was the worst dish we've had here as the sauce used was too overbearing and salty. it was a creamy spicy red sauce similar to a dynamite sauce used in other sushi joints. For some reason, it just didn't go well with the texture of the rock shrimp tempura. Other than that, Nobu was a great experience and would definitely come back here again for sure.",

    "text": "Nobu is a great place to splurge when you have time and want to have good Japanese food.  A few quick notes about how to eat there.  1, I've heard the omikase is excellent. It's a safe way to try a nice selection of things. 2, be nice to your waiter, and it will make all the difference. In general, be nice to the person that brings you your food, and you'll have a better, healthier, more hygenic meal, but here, being nice can mean great service, good advice, and a wonderful experience. I have 1 friend who is a waiter there, and if he can't serve me when I go, I make sure one of the other folks who has helped him wait on me before is my waiter, and I've never had a bad meal, bad location, or bad service. 3, the black cod with miso, and hamachi with jalapeno and ponzu are  musts on the menu. I also recommend the squid pasta, rock shrimp tempura, sashimi salad, and spicy tuna rolls.  The spicy tuna roll there is the best version I've ever had.  The black cod is probably the best treatment of cooked fish I've ever consumed. 4, enjoy the celebrity spotting. I actually sat next to Wayne Brady (a very nice guy, and super polite to the staff) at one dinner, and Tiffany Amber Thiessen was there a different night. I can't say the same nice things about her that I mentioned about Wayne Brady.  All in all, a great meal.  And get the nigori sake...best bang for your buck alcohol wise, and very tasty.",

First of all the waiter was very helpful, attentive, and delightful through all 10 or so dishes - they're happy to explain what everything is. The portions are small, so it's enough food that you can still eat it all. They will alter your dishes to your dietary needs (example: I can't eat shrimp - not a problem). It was extremely fun to see what dish was coming next from an assortment of cold, hot, sushi, and desserts. My favorites were the Nobu ale, the black snapper (yes black, not red), the Japanese mountain peach fruit, the green tea fudge, and the foie gras that just melts in your mouth.",

    "text": "NOBU. . .Narcissistic. . .Outrageous. . .Bracing . . .Unconventional.  These are just a few words that come to mind after I experienced Nobu. Because really, you don't dine or even eat at Nobu . . .you experience it with all of your senses. Yes, it is expensive, but what do you expect? You're in Vegas, a city that thrives on the temptation and transiency of money.   It is glaringly obvious that the chefs at Nobu approach sushi and food like art. From the flawless presentation of each plate to the masterful blending of the phenomenal flavors, dining here is like watching art unveil itself. I tasted unique creations at Nobu that I have never tasted before anywhere else, nor will I probably ever come across again except at this restaurant. Every time a new plate arrived at our table, I felt like applauding (and in many instances, we did). I can not even begin to describe the parade of culinary wonders that we experienced. There was hamachi sashimi with jalapeno, kobe beef carpaccio, marinated cod lettuce wraps, and a wide variety of sashimi and rolls that blew your mind (to name a few). Each was an explosive fusion of the Far East and the rest of the world that stimulated your taste buds. They also have an impressive selection of flavored sake that only serves to emphasize the aromatics of the food.  Not only is Nobu candy for your soul, it is candy for the eyes as well. Don't be surprised if you dine next to an unshaven Justin Timberlake, bitchy Paris Hilton, drunk Vince Vaughn or bald Britney Spears. Just remember to play it cool, you are at Nobu after all.",

I remember the Black Cod melting in my mouth and the exotic trout which shocked my tongue in a good way.  The Kobe beef was heavenly...  Just thinking about this meal has me wondering when I'll be in Vegas again.  Just don't order the regular sushi though, I heard it's good but it's probably something you can get at any decent sushi joint that you live near.  You have to get the \"special\" menu items.",

We bought the $95 Groupon ($150 value) which included a five-course tasting menu for two. My favorite was the first dish, their signature yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno. I do agree with other reviewers who said the sashimi was a bit thin, but wow did it taste great. The dessert dish was a close second favorite. It included a molten chocolate cake, green tea ice cream, and a whiskey-infused cappuccino-like dessert. My least favorite was the assorted sushi dish that included a california roll and six pieces of nigiri (tuna, salmon, and snapper). Every other dish was unique and full of flavor, while this assorted sushi dish was average at best.  Aside from the five-course meal, we also ordered their popular cucumber martini. It was a strong little drink with a fantastically fresh aroma. I don't often love the scent of alcohol but this drink was a definite exception.  We had a very satisfying experience overall. Although slow at times, the service was great and every dish was thoroughly explained. The manager was also quite nice and stopped to speak with us for a moment.  We weren't entirely stuffed by the end of our five courses, but we were full enough. Overall, the food-tasting was a True experience and definitely worth a try, but this isn't a place I would frequent due to their notably high prices. To sum up my review - if you're into high quality Japanese tapas-like dishes and can easily afford the heady price point, this place is for you!",

We got there pretty early around 5ish so they were able to sit us without a res. Our Waiter Jeffrey was on point. Best service. He recommended we start with the Yellowtail Sashimi with jalapeno. It was melt in my mouth amazing. i could live off the dish for the rest of my life. LOL. It was yellowtail with the right amount of sweetness and spice. We also got the cucumber salad which was pretty good. A lot of the vinegar did go to the bottom of the bowl which made it hard to coat your salad but It was still good. We also had a sear salmon sashimi which I do not remember the name that was excellent. We got spicy edamame, Beef Kushiyaki, the Black Cod with Miso and the Wagyu Beef Gyoza. The Cod was really good and highly recommended. The Wagyu beef was great with two dipping sauces. We literally could have kept ordering food. We had a couple of nice cocktails as well.   After dinner they brought us out a plate with Happy Birthday with a choc cake and green icecream. We also ordered the Whiskey Moose. Both desserts were to die for and I was in Heaven.   What a fun place to go. You have people dressed to the max, casual people, people from all over the world that come and eat here. Come chow down some amazing eats, listen to some funky music and watch the beautiful people. Yes please!",

    "text": "Nobu and I go waaaay back.  I've eaten at Nobu NY in the Morimoto days, Nobu next door, Nobu London, and Nobu 57.  I've been to events where Nobu himself was preparing our sushi.  I've since been fortunate enough to head to Tokyo a few times and tried ultra high end sushi, teppanyaki, and kaiseki at the source.  None of which has diminished my affection for Nobu and it's particular brand of fusion cuisine.  To be fair, I was restrained in my ordering this visit - having the Miso Cod (how can you not?) and sushi.  It was excellent, as expected.  I was alone and sat at the sushi bar  But if you aren't lucky enough to have easy access to one of the myriad Nobu outposts, and this is your one shot, I beg you to try the tasting menu, which goes by the Japanese name \"Omakase\".  The ingredients will be unfamiliar, the presentations beautiful, and the experience mind bending.",

I drink about 1-3 of these a day and when I go out I will order each bartender's (worth his salt) version of the drink with an open mind before deciding to keep drinking it or tell him to make the one I love. Brian, a young but honest kid, made me the cocktail with the exception of NO cherry (blasphemy in my opinion). I was reluctant of the drink at first watching him make it but it was subtle and smooth, very pleasant, but it was missing something. Being that it was a Japanese restaurant and bar, he used the Nikka Coffee whisky (again more reservations as I prefer Knob Creek Single Barrel), and so on the second drink, after being pleasantly surprised, I boldly asked him to make his full interpretation of the Old Fashioned with cherry.  Great and memorable is how I would describe it. I HATE cherries. HATE. No cherry flavor. Instead, the way he does it creates body and more subtle flavor, enhancing the drink. It ain't some fancy girly drink. Just a good whisky cocktail with nice flavor. He does a few EXTRAS things to the cocktail but you will have to go there and ask for it yourself to see it for yourself. Kid worked hard and was attentive for a timeless drink. What more can you ask for.",

I have been to the Nobu in Malibu and yes , can't beat the view but this place is the original Nobu and the sushi tasted a little better. They used different sauces on some things I noticed. The Kronuts were a must try for dessert. What I love most about this place is you will never feel full or bloated, just completely satisfied. The service is top quality and very professional. Tiradito sashimi is an absolute must try and the  Spicy Tuna hand roll is also my favorite.",

So we ended up doing the family style and it was worth it. We did pick to spend $100 per person. We had about 7 nice sized dishes and they were all amazing. Your favorite one was the popcorn shrimp in a chipotle type orange sauce. It was out of this world that I had to order more after all the family style. A must try place!

    "text": "If you come here, make sure you ask for another server if you are unfortunate enough to get Roye. The food was great, don't get me wrong, but the service at the end of the meal left such a bitter taste on my palate.  The black cod with miso - 5/5 stars. Definitely a must-have if you're coming here for the first time.  The creamy spicy crab - 3/5 stars. It was very oily, salty, and didn't impress us. Felt like it should've been served with some kind of carb (maybe bread or rice or noodles).  The yellowtail jalapeno - 5/5 stars. Fresh fish and very subtle jalapeno flavors - delicious.  The bento box - 4/5 stars. Ordinary dessert, nothing special and small portion size (the chocolate lava cake at Max Brenner is 100x better).  Now back to my bad service experience. First, Roye mistakenly gave me the alcoholic lychee martini, when I distinctly ordered the lychee/pomegranate juice. The difference: juice is $7 and the martini is $14. He was nice enough to change my drink without much hassles, however, when we received the bill after our meal, he forgot to take the martini off. I politely asked him to change it and he agreed, however, he disappeared - we were left sitting there wondering what happened to him, then finally we noticed him chatting w/the folks at a nearby table and didn't acknowledge me when I tried to get his attention regarding the bill. FINALLY after 20 minutes of waiting, I flagged down another waiter and he was able to get the revised bill to me in less than a minute!  Roye totally left us waiting - if he was super busy, he SHOULD have asked someone to fix our bill - no excuse, especially after spending ~$200 at this place. I don't think it's wrong to expect better service and treatment.  Nobu - you should hire or train the servers to make sure the customers are satisfied, your food can't speak for itself.",

The food was good, however the ambience was in line with what you see at a neighborhood sushi place. They need to remodel the decor is tired and not good. When you send $500.00 on dinner you don't want to stare at an emergency exit door with dirt and paint chipped while your at dinner.  We were disappointed with the experience and woudl nto go back unless they remodeled. I notified our concierge nto to refer to this location.",

I wish I could remember our waiter's name, because he was magnificent! 10/10!  Our table ordered the edamame, rock shrimp, and three sushi rolls: House special, soft shell crab, and spicy tuna. The soft shell crab was by far my favorite; though all the rolls were fresh and delicious. The edamame was right on point too! I wanted to love the rock shrimp, as that's typically my go-to when its on the menu. The waiter said it was a popular menu item, though I didn't love it.   I appreciated the low lighting and ambiance of the restaurant; very unique   I definitely recommend going here for the sushi! I will definitely be back when I'm back in Vegas",

Each course is clearly well thought out and highly appealing based off of sight, smell, and taste. I would definitely come here again just to see what they have to offer besides omakase.",

One course after another was a complete delight. We felt spoiled as we got served by the sushi bar. It was a fun location where I will again choose. Every dish served has that perfect bite. Flavorful, exquisite, decadent. It was fun watching chefs after chefs making beautiful food art. I anticipated each plate with enthusiasm, and one topped the previous one. Honestly, I can't remember each dish's name, but I love them all. I may have to come back and order Omakase again to get the dish names, but I'm sure it won't be the same type of dishes served to us. Japanese restaurants aren't the same to me anymore if they don't have Omakase in their menu. Now I miss it.",

Our group of nine had a reservation and we're immediately seated on Saturday night.   I ordered the cucumber martini and I found my drink to be strong but still good tasting. Others ordered other special cocktails and wine.   Our sever was welcoming and helpful -- as truth be told, the menu is a bit overwhelming. As a non-adventurous sushi lover, I decided I was going to try a hot dish. Our server helped describe options that matched what I was looking for. Other guests at the table were also offered help on understanding the menu, we're offered special selections based on price points, and recommendations.  I ended up ordering the Toban-Yaki beef. I added a side of rice to make it feel like a hardier meal (plus some carbs). The beef was perfectly cooked as I ordered (medium rare) and served with carmalized onions and asapargus. I loved this dish! The dish was $50 and the side of rice $3.  Others enjoyed the flavor-forward tacos, many rolls of sushi, and miso soup. The tacos while beautiful and flavorful we're very small portions. One order came out with only one mini taco.   At the end of the meal, the kitchen brought out a special congratulations dessert for our bachelorette. The Banana Harumaki was amazing!  This place has great quality food, but also a pretty hefty price tag. For us, this celebration was worth it!",

The wait staff is very friendly and attentive. We order the Omakase for 125 a head. I tell them I don't want any beef, chicken or pork. They are more than happy to accommodate my request. I ordered some sake beer and uni shooters.  The food is good but not great in my opinion. I think the food is not any better than places at fraction of the cost. The experience is top notch and the wait staff is comparable to any high end restaurant so I expected to pay top dollar but not excessive. So long story short we walk out of there feeling robbed. I won't complain about the cost of a meal if I feel it was justified. The quality did not justify the bill in my opinion.",

    "text": "Overall an amazing experience with amazing service from every employee. Since it was our first time trying Nobu, we opted for the Nobu Signature Omakase for $125 USD for an 8 course meal.   *REASONS FOR NOT GIVING 5 STARS* when we sat down, we were kind of just bombarded with if we wanted edamame or something else (don't remember) but was not told it was $8. I would've much preferred to see the other options on the menu for something to snack on instead of paying for plain salted beans. The waiter also rounded our bill up by $2 (before tax) and when brought it up he just said sorry instead of fixing it. Like it's not that much money but at an upscale restaurant or just any restaurant in general, you should be transparent about pricing if you want people to trust the restaurant. Also we weren't fans of the dessert.   Now onto the food!   Course 1,2,3: Tataki dishes (5/5) They were each so unique in their own way. The red snapped had yuzu (which is a citrus) and chilli which really helped open up the pallet and left you wanting more. The salmon had more of a typical Japanese flavour with the ponzu and sesame but still very good. My boyfriend and I loved the yellowtail the most. It was literally like an explosion of flavour in our mouths. I can't even explain how much I enjoyed it.   Course 4: Tempura rock shrimp (4/5) To me this was more of a filler course. It was nice and crispy and had a Japanese mayo coating on it. It wasn't really anything special to me so if I was getting a la carte, it wouldn't be something I'd gravitate towards just because of how pricey it is on its own.   Course 5: Miso cod (5/5) My boyfriend absolutely loved this dish. The cod was so soft and flavourful. The skin of the cod really helped add that layer of fatty-ness so that it would melt in your mouth.   Course 6: Steak (4/5) The first couple of the pieces of the steak were a bit over cooked and so it was more on the chewy side but once we got into the middle pieces they were very tender. It was another good dish but nothing wow like the shrimp.   Course 7: Assorted sushi (3.5/5) Considering it's supposed to be a sushi bar, I didn't actually go as crazy as I thought I would. The only one that I really loved from the dish was the spicy tuna. The spice that they use is (obviously) quite different from the typical mayo and sriracha mix so it was really a new experience of the flavour for me. The spider roll was pretty standard and the 2 nigiri (mackerel and not too sure about the other one) were alright as the fish wasn't as smooth as the first tataki dishes.    Course 8: Raspberry filled beignets and a cup of fruit with meringues and cream. (0.5/5) The dessert was the most disappointing part of the whole experience. I honestly expected more of an Japanese fusion dessert like something with mochi and was surprised at the dish when it got to our table. I honestly didn't enjoy any part of it. The raspberry in the beignets were too sour for my liking, the (vanilla?) ice cream on the side had a bit of a tang to it. The cream cup with fruit and meringues also wasn't that great either. We just ate the fruit in it.",

It is served over hot rocks, and sliced very thin making it shareable for the whole table. Everyone will defiantly love it.   Along with that, I had a spicy tuna roll which was great, and an assortment of sashimi. The fish was the best quality and all of it melted in your mouth.",

Fantastic and unique ambiance.....you want a round booth for sure rather than a regular table. Service was impeccable, with one criticism.......a better description of some of the more cryptic non-sushi menu items. If you love sushi......it doesn't get any better with quality, freshness and creativity! Will never disappoint. The steak dish we ordered was disappointing. Meat was sliced a bit too thick for you to put the whole piece in your mouth and comfortably chew. Quality of meat was fine, but this soupy secret sauce finish was not good.  Hamachi tartare with caviar and spicy scallop hand roll were heavenly!  No Nobu restaurant is ever going to be a bargain, but at these prices and small portions I expect perfection. My Old Fashioned was missing that special Italian cherry.   I'm a huge Nobu fan and will return but I'm sticking to the sushi........leave the cooked meats to others at my table.",

This was my second time here, but both times was with a reservation made through OpenTable. I'm going to be focused on the second experience.  So we get there a bit before 6, so we lounge nearby. Once open, my group of 4 take us and our luggage to the host desk and check in. They take our luggage and stow it away so we don't have to worry about it during our dinner. It was all my friends' first time going there, so I recommended for sure the yellowtail. I wanted to do the omakase but wasn't sure if everyone else was down after splurging the entire weekend. BUT THEY DID!  And ooooooh boy, did we not regret it. We got the cheapest of the choices, but still a lot at ~125+ per person.  The greatest was that our waitress overheard that we were interested in the wagyu beef, so she put it in our tastings. SO GREAT.  Would definitely recommend this one (as opposed to the one at Caesar's) as it's less crowded.",

    "text": "Nestled inside the Hard Rock Hotel, Nobu Restaurant serves a bit of classic and contemporary Japanese cuisine. When we arrived, we were greeted at the front by the manager in a suit. Very classify and well dressed.   I found out about this place through Travelzoo. I was using a voucher which included a six-course tasting menu and cocktail drinks for two. I presented the coupon, and the manager easily scanned to redeem.   Course 1: Edamame In my opinion, this was the most disappointing of the six. The preparation and the taste were good, but the idea of serving edamame as a course was not so pleasing. I cringed when I found out it was part of the course, and I wished I tried something new or creative.   Course 2: Steel trout Carpaccio The orange texture made it seemed like it was a salmon. But, it had a light flavor and the yuzu sauce complemented well in the dish.  Course 3: Sushi (Blue Fin Tuna, Shrimp, Fluke) and California Roll with Snow Crab Bueno. Always ay no to imitation crab if you can get the real meat.  Course 4: Spicy Shrimp with Asparagus and Shitake Mushrooms This dish was very contemporary. I wasn't sure if I was tasting Japanese or Chinese cuisine. I can't say I enjoyed this dish very much. Something was missing about this dish, whether it lacked spice or having that umami taste. It wasn't wholly satisfying.  Course 5: Miso Black Cod  EXCELLENT. Best course meal on the menu. The meat melted like butter. The server also explained this dish is a lot of people's favorite and now I know why.   Course 6: Beignet Okinawan Style Inside the beignet was filled with raspberry jelly. I loved how the bite size and medley of fruits to complement the dessert.",

    "text": "Although I live near many different Nobu locations in Los Angeles, I decided to try it out for the first time while visiting Las Vegas. I had high expectations given the price and boy did it live up to those standards! The food was delicious, the drinks were interesting and the service was excellent. I went during the week so it was easy to get a reservation on Opentable.   I recommend trying the below:  Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno $32 Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna $30 Tuna Tacos $9 ea Chilean Seabass with Spicy Black Bean Sauce $48 LOTS of options for sushi - my favorites were: Albacore, Toro, Yellowtail   We were also brought out a special dessert for our anniversary - great touch! They are also great with food allergies, just mention it to your server and they are more than happy to accommodate. All in all, be prepared to drop A LOT of money here. There is a lot to choose from on the menu and you are going to want to try everything. I am a huge fan of Sugarfish and think their sushi is #1, so this was a close second, but the price was 100X as much, so save this place for a special occasion :)",

Have to say its always a pleasure and a memorable experience dinning at Nobu.. - Great food, great service, great ambience.   To start: The crispy rock shrimp tempura (was good nothing special, probably wouldn't order it again, The Toro tartar decadent and AMAZING, and the Wagyu gyoza and Salmon Sashimi were incredible.   Yellowtail is always a must, so fresh and clean and the jalapenos give the fish perfect amount of heat.   The Black cod miso never gets old and i order it ALL the time. Incredibly flaky, juicy and cooked to perfection. Always lives up to the hype. Sauce as sweet but not too heavy.  The Japanese wagyu is another one of my favorites. Presentation outstanding and such a beautiful dish. Love the idea of being able to cook my wagyu on the hot stone and trying it with the different sauces. We Ordered 12 oz and it was gone in a mater of minutes. The wagyu was super tender and beyond delicious.   Nobu is one of my favorite restaurants to visit. It never disappoints. From food, service, drinks and atmosphere its always an amazing experience",

    "text": "Hands down my favorite place to dine anywhere on earth. I make sure I dine at Nobu everytime I visit Vegas (which is quite often). They have lots of \"signiture\" dishes and they always have a \"new\" or \"special\" item or two on their menu. here's a little secret, they have quite a few other \"signiture\" items that they do not even place on their menu, be sure to ask your server about a few of the great items not listed such as the black miso glazed lettuce cups. The place has an up-beat vibe, modern decor and great music playing, also some of the best people watching in town. It's also VERY common to run into celebs dining there as well. It's a little bit pricy, expect to pay at least $100 per person with a couple of cocktails each(that's prob on the low side to be honest), my last visit cost me over $700 for 3 people but worth every penny, I have paid more at other places in the past for FAR FAR less. As with most any place Fri and Sat evening are their busiest, reservations at peak dining hours 8:00-10:00pm on these nights usually book up 3 weeks in advance so make sure you plan ahead.  Side note; I have eaten at both the Nobu in LA and Miami and neither of them compare to the one in Vegas, I'm really not sure why??? I would give LA 4 Stars and Miami 3 Stars. If you had a mediocre or bad experience at another Nobu give the one inside the Hard Rock in Vegas a shot, you will be delighted.",

I think we had a roll that was just comprised of an assortment of raw fish which was unremarkable, but we also asked the waiter the crowd favorites, and we got the Miso-cod, and hamachi sashimi with jalepeno, which were heaven sent. I'd never had cooked fish as melt-y, velvet-y as that black cod, and the marinade they used was Amazing. Portions are miniscule, but that's because this is 1%-ers place, and they never eat much.  The atmospohere is as swanky as you would expect in Vegas, with the dim lighting and the bamboo stick-pillars which are strategically placed throughout the establishment to remind you you've crossed the \"eastern exotic\" threshold. I know I sleep on a bed of rice and panda fur to keep myself authentically Asian. I think we had sake or water that was poured out of bamboo shoot-looking vases as well.   The waiter looked a little annoyed we spent less than $200 here. It felt like jewelry store, commission driven pressure. Still, hella good food.",

Prices:  extreme... Your paying a hefty premium to eat at Nobu.  To some, being able to name drop is worth the price, but the food and experience don't justify the price.  Final take:  Nobu is tasty but lacks inspiration.  The dining experience was nothing experiential nor terribly memorable.  Given all the other options in Vegas I won't be going back.

He did warn us because of our reservation time (10:15P) and kitchen closing (11P), that he was unsure how they would send out what we ordered. So we were prepared. Of course, if you are spending Nobu money my feeling is the chefs serve until you are done. But that is the only reason for the 4th star, well and another completely over priced wine list.   I have been to Nobu Next Door in NYC, so this was a different experience.  Onto the food; We jumped all over the menu but stayed away from the sashimi because that seemed over priced for sashimi. We ended up with a few hand rolls that were great because the Nori was crispy (which seems tough for other places to pull off).   From there we also had the Yellowtail with Jalapeno, as always. Then we had the lobster ceviche, and a couple lobster tacos as well. Both good and the lobster was great.  Make sure you get the Black Cod with Miso in lettuce. Awesome! just eat it straight away because it comes warm.  If you haven't been, go!",

Final straw was when I was sitting with my napkin in my hand and he quite literally yanked it out of my hand - REALLY!!!! It took a lot of self-control not to stand up and yell out after him. We will never come again to endure that kind of treatment for a tab of $230 for two.",

    "text": "Finally - the meal to kill all meals.  This is when I regret NOT taking a picture of every dish and writing down the name and ingredients. I forgot I even had a food blog until  of the way into my dinner. That is definitely a compliment!  Nobu is famous for a reason. If you are going to eat here, prepare to drop some money. $100 pp minimum, $150 pp is more like it and that's without drinks.  Interestingly, even though you feel like you ate a ton of food, it really isn't that much. If you have a big eater in your group, have him/her eat something first. This is a place to savor each bite, not to eat like pigs at a trough. (That's what the Planet Hollywood buffet is for.)  And when they ask if you want edamame, they are $7 a bowl, not free.   The restaurant is gorgeous. We had reservations at 7:00 on a Saturday, and even though we arrived at 6:20, we were seated immediately.  Dress was anywhere from casual to dressy, even jeans (which leads me to the old adage - just because you can, doesn't mean you should.)  I had ordered a blueberry mojito ($15) but only took a small sip when I realized it was WAY too strong. The waiter took it off the bill without me having to complain about it. That's ok - the food was so good, I was fine with water.  Instead of ordering off the menu, we went Omakase style - the chef makes the selections. Actually, it seems like your waiter makes the selections but that's close enough. The waiter asked us our likes and dislikes so he could tailor our food to our tastes. We said we didn't eat mussels, clams, oysters and that sort of thing. Other than that, it was going to be a free for all. (In listening to the other servers describe dishes to the other customers, I suspect there is a standard Omakase menu.)  The menu was chosen to give a different sensation with each dish. We started with the cold dishes, had two hot dishes and then continued with more cold dishes (which don't seem to fill you up for some reason.)  The first selection was yellowtail sashimi with miso with a shaved bit of jalapeno and a cilantro leaf for each bite. I don't like spicy foods so I was hesitant about the jalepeno. But I'm glad I tried it. YOWZA - the jalapeno was small enough to give you that kick without making you scream for water. And the cilantro cooled down the fire. The yellowtail was so fresh, you wouldn't even know it was fish. I've never ordered sashimi before and I'm hooked. Wow, wow, wow.  The next choice was whitefish sashimi with ponzu and garlic chips. I wish I could have poured the sauce in a cup and drank it, it was THAT flavorful.   We had salmon sashimi with caviar and dill, blue fin toro sashimi, Japanese red snapper with dried miso and seared tuna with ponzu. Every dish kept getting better and better and had its own unique flavor and special quality to it.   Our hot dishes consisted of beef tenderloin with a butternut squash base and topped with cooked purple onions. The beef was so tender, it fell apart with the chopsticks.  Our second hot dish was 2 pieces of cod and 2 pieces of scallops baked in phyllo - both in butter lettuce cups.  I preferred the scallops over the cod which surprised me because I've never eaten scallops before and I generally like cod.   My least favorite dish was the hearts of palm salad. It was a nice change to the other fish items but probably not worth $20.  The servers were so attentive - both in bringing the food and the clean up afterward.  My recommendations to enjoying Nobo (1) realize that you're going to spend a ton of money so quit whining about the price or eat at HomeTown Buffet (2) don't order off the menu - the point is to try something new that you would never otherwise see at your favorite sushi place (ie - don't order friggin' tempura or California rolls at Nobu and then complain that it tastes better at your local strip mall) (3) come here with 4 or less people. People tend to be greedier when they are in big groups so you may pay $150 and eat 4 bites of sashimi which would be a total rip off. (4) you're not there to stuff yourself (see #1), you're there to appreciate the art of food.  So sit back, let someone else do the ordering and savor every bite.",

I have found places like Sushi Joint in Glendale, and even the Wokcano chain in Burbank. Both offer, in my opinion some fantastic Sushi. Then comes the overpriced Nobu in the Hard Rock. Sure the presentation is nice, but when the waiter told me to eat cloves in between bites of the Yellowtail I was laughing in the inside. No eating cloves in between bites does NOT make the YellowTail taste any better than normal.   You know what this place is, its above average Sushi that if you believe the nonsense, you might think this place is something amazing. But I thought the Sushi had a stronger fish taste than normal, and the dishes to be overpriced for the quality/quantity that was given. Its ok, its better thank ok.. but its not $150 for two people ok.  We have amazing sushi in LA, so I wasn't impressed with Nobu.",

    "text": "[Michelin Star #11]  Night one of my three-day Vegas Michelin dining binge brought me to Nobu.  The occasion:  friend's birthday.    Upon arrival, we were led through a crowded dining room full of boisterous patrons drinking sake and beer to a table at which we were rubbing elbows with the parties around us.  First things first:  this place is not where you want to go for an elegant Japanese meal, but it is perfect for bigger groups.    When our waiter arrived, he took our drink orders, then instead of announcing any specials, he told us that for a group of our size, he \"strongly recommended\" that we do family style.  He said it in a tone that left no other option.  Of course family style makes sense, but it seems to me that an establishment with Nobu's reputation (and Michelin star!) should be far more accommodating to its patrons.  But I do understand that it is likely difficult to navigate one's way through such a crowded restaurant with the myriad of plates that accompany most Japanese meals.  My group opted for the omakase.  We were brought a nice variety of both hot and cold dishes, raw and cooked.  The highlight of the meal was the miso black cod.  The dish was placed in the center of the table, and following this was an unanimous chorus of approval as we each tasted this delectable morsel;  definitely umami.  I also enjoyed the nicely seasoned yellowtail sashimi a great deal, but it wasn't the best yellowtail I've had by far.  The rest of the dishes were less memorable, but still well executed.  The final few courses consisted of rolls whose fish to rice ratio was unreasonably high - yeah, I could tell they were trying to fill me up.    Were I to rate the food alone, Nobu would be a solid four star establishment.  But Nobu is a Michelin rated restaurant, and I'd like to rate it by Michelin standards.  These places, in my experience, don't pack their diners in like sardines, and especially don't have patronizing waiters.  I enjoyed my experience at Nobu, but the enjoyment was more about the company than the restaurant itself.    I've been told that Nobu's other locations are much classier than the one on the Vegas strip.  If that's the case, then shame on those Michelin guys for giving this particular location a star.",

Before I left for Vegas he said go to Nobu and spend $150 on him!!! Nice boss!   I sat at the sushi bar and told my chef it was my first time and to make me something good and he certainly did. I left it all up to him and he served me numerous plates of fancy sashimi...salmon, yellowtail, barracuda, and more! I thought I would miss rice, but I did not. I had a Japanese beer and 2 glasses of red. I had no idea how much the check would be...turned out to be about $135 + tip, which worked out well for my budget! lol p.s. the wine was $17/glass...ouch. Anyway, I never ate so much sashimi before and enjoyed every bite!  Oh and  the waiter I had was really nice and attentive.",

My only issue the level of foodieness that is the norm here; I don't eat any grains, soy, or dairy (yeah I know don't eat sushi right?!?) and at some sushi places they will make rolls with cucumber instead of rice.  Not here - they were very helpful in terms of switching sauces and advising against dishes that could not be 'tampered' with but overall it was a bit of a chore to choose wisely.  That being said the quality of ingredients was awesome; that is why i eat sushi...i like fresh fish.  We had some hot dishes too...totally forgot what but loved every bite.    SO I vote YES to this place unless you eat paleo and want to dine with semi-reckless abandon, in that case go get a burger, hold the bun, ketchup, and fries.",

    "text": "My first visit to a Nobu outpost was about 5 years ago at Nobu Next Door in New York City.  At that point I was still evolving into the foodie that I am today, and for some reason, I absolutely loved the hot spot.  The food was innovative; the atmosphere was exclusive; and snagging a table was a super-heroic feat.  In the years that have passed since, Nobu has expanded, and I have also eaten at their Nobu 57 in Manhattan and the Vegas location.  As food culture and my passion for it have evolved, so has my dislike of Nobu.  This chain has lost its unique luster, and the quality of the dishes has become a mixed bag.  While some hot and cold courses are better than others, almost anything beats their sushi, which tastes like something ordered from a supermarket's counter.    My sushi-fanatic friend and I recently booked a trip to Vegas, and her sister had insisted that she try Nobu.  I knew that my friend was focused on it, so I went along with the recommendation, though I knew better.  We wound up heading there on our first evening, which at least paved the way for better and better meals as the vacation progressed.  Our reservation enabled us to get a table at the crowded spot, and we were immediately seated at a prime location in the center of the dining room.  My friend ordered a glass of sangria, while I opted for a fruity martini, which was so horrifically sweet that I needed to exchange it for a basic glass of Sauvignon Blanc.  The wine also turned out to be very acidic and not at all similar to the waiter's description.  In terms of the food, we started with two appetizers.  A tiny mound of cool, fresh Salmon Tartare was immersed in a small bowl of fragrant miso oil and topped with a generous helping of salty Caviar.  I am very picky about my tartare, judging it by the amount or lack of flavor it exudes.  This particular version was surprisingly well-seasoned and delicious.  We also sampled one of my favorites - the Rock Shrimp Tempura with Spicy Sauce.  The succulent fried balls of rock shrimp melted in our mouths, and the spicy mayo sauce added a creamy kick.   My friend stayed firm on our ordering sushi, so we requested the fusion-style House Special Roll and the Spicy Scallop Roll.  The spicy scallop one was pretty flavorful, but their house blend, which included several kinds of fish, had zero taste.  We actually sent it back and did not even bother to order a replacement.  Unfortunately, I think this restaurant has lost its pizazz, and my friend was not impressed either.  I would really only recommend it for its non-sushi menu items, but even those are inconsistent.",

Definitely worth the price if you are a tourist and staying on the strip, but if you are a from LV there are many great options that are similar in stars at a much more fair price.    The place is great...but to me its another commercial restaurant that you are paying for the name and reputation and not the \"food at a fair price\"  I am confident that the rating would be 5 Stars regardless of price if the chef who was on the sign owned/operated/was actually there weekly.",

    "text": "Let me preface this review by saying that I'm a huge self-admitted sushi addict and my husband is Peruvian, so Nobu seemed a logical choice for our 7th anniversary dinner.  Aside from the villainous penny slots  just outside the door, it was the perfect choice.   We started out with the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno.  Yellowtail is by far my favorite raw fish and I've had a similar dish at several excellent Bay Area restaurants, but this was by far the most flavorful rendering of this dish that I've had. The sashimi was also not razor thin which was an awesome added bonus (honestly, I've gotten use to the fact that fine dining, particularly in Vegas, means small portions and high prices so the amount of fish was a pleasant surprise.   Next, we tried the Tiradito Nobu Style with some type of halibut like fish.  Now, here the fish was razor thin, but came out with a dot of rocoto, a block of rock salt, the traditional lime juice and a side of cilantro.  My husband says this is exactly what Tiradito is supposed to taste like, which makes me want to spend significantly more time in Peru.  It was amazing.  We then moved on to the Black Cod Miso next and honestly, this was the only part of the meal that I was underwhelmed by.  I know that this is supposed to be the signature hot dish at Nobu, but I've had a very similar dish at both Morimoto Napa and at Hyakumi at Cesar's Palace and the texture of the fish wasn't the melt in your mouth awesomeness that I have come to expect from the dish. The flavor was right on, and if I'd never had black cod before, I would have loved it.    So, we moved back to the cold dishes and tried the New Style Salmon Sashimi (new style because it's served with ginger, and some other amazing deliciousnesss that I can't recall right now), finishing off the savory with the Toro Green Onion Maki (Cut).  They were both amazing.   What shocked me was how incredibly amazing the two desserts we had were.  We tried the bento box, a flourless chocolate cake with house-made green tea ice cream, and this peach cobbler like dish with almond miso crumble and ginger ice cream.  I don't know if anyone else finds some green tea ice cream to sometimes taste vaguely like lipstick, but this ice cream was delicate and a beautiful companion to the rich chocolate cake.  The warm peaches with the crumble and (again not overpowering) ginger ice cream was a highlight of my whole trip to Vegas.  (And I'm not really a dessert person)  Okay, this review is way too long, and I didn't even mention the impeccable service.  I can't wait to go back and wish there was a Nobu in the Bay Area.",

    "text": "I ate here for a business dinner and sat at one of the tables but ordered omakase from the sushi bar.  My colleagues and I went big and went with $150 a person so we had high expectations...  I will try my best to remember everything that came out...(not in order)  The first dish was a salmon trout sahimi with ikura eggs inside.  The fish had some chewy veins in it, and there wasn't any type of sauce on it - I guess we were supposed to enjoy the 2 components together.  There was a dish of fatty tuna (otoro) on top of a rock salt.  This was unique and the fish was melty  there was a miso soup type dish that came out that used delicious dashi broth - anyone who understands umami would've enjoyed this  kobe beef with special mayo sauce was good, but nothing spectacular  scallops in a green guacamole sauce was edible, but the balance wasn't completely there  kanpachi with ponzu sauce and jalapeno was good too but trendy  in the end, a full platter of sushi came with the trademark \"Nobu\" mark on the egg sushi - this was perhaps the most dissapointing.  The fish tasted bland, the rice was somewhat hardened like it was sitting out for a while, and I really would've liked to end the night on a high note but this last platter of mediocre sushi ended the night on a low note  and the bill at the end was not a pretty sight...  I probably will not go back to Nobu again unless it's free.  I was just expecting so much more because of all the hype.    however on the plus side the service is excellent - the servers are all very attentive.  and the atmosphere, being inside the Hard Rock Hotel, is hip and lively.",

As always, it was fantastic. The cucumber martini was so very refreshing I am still craving it. The yellow tail sashimi with jalapeno has the best citrus soy sauce - we actually came back & got a drink & this dish again before we went out another night because it was so good & light. We also had the lobster tacos which were great.  For hot dishes, we had the rock shrimp tempura with ponzu sauce and the black cod with miso. Can you say melt in your mouth? This is the reason I return to Nobu again & again.",

Everytime we come here, the chefs are always talking to the guests to see how everything is going.    I would recommend the Omosake menu.  Let the chefs give you the best things from the kitchen.  Just tell them what you can't have and then will make you a happy person. Our favorites our the black cod miso.  I saw someone say it was too sweet but I disagree.  it's perfect.  The yellowtail sashimi is my wifes favorite.  One of their options last fall was a shaved asparagus and crab salad.  I still have dreams about it.    Can't go wrong.  It is expensive but very reasonable compared to other restaurants, especially on the strip",

    "text": "Wow. I was seriously impressed with this place. This place ranks second to French Laundry on my list of favorites.   First- if you are a first time visitor there, I would recommend just ordering off of the menu. I am sure the Omakase is great but you have to try the signature dishes- and you may not get to try them all with the Omakase.   Second- don't have the sushi be your primary focus. It's okay- but the other items are so much better. We saw people around us doing nothing but order sushi- what a waste!   Third- the warm dishes tended to be larger portions than the cold and raw dishes. Just a FYI if you want to budget your appetite and your wallet. I also felt that the dishes with a tart factor (see below) were too overwhelming. I would pass on these- IMO the tartness is so much you can't enjoy the other flavors that might be there.   We started with edammame and the sheshito peppers. Pass on the edamamme - there is nothing great about it- and you don't need to fill up your tummy with average stuff. The sheshito peppers were really good. They taste like small green bell peppers and the miso and sesame sauce on top has a great flavor. My husband is so picky when it comes to veggies and he even enjoyed this. My only word of caution- occasionally you get a spicy one!   So we relied on our fellow yelpers and ordered the following items:   1. Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno - definitely get this- it was awesome!   2. The blackened miso cod- by far, the highlight of the evening   3. Chilean sea bass- cooked the special of the day way (yummy)- it had tomatoes, and onions, some white wine sauce   4. Kobe beef on skewers- pass- it was okay but not great   5. Lobster Ceviche- pass- the tartness was way too overwhelming   6. Red snapper with dry miso - pass- again, tartness too overwhelming   7. Then we ordered some basic filler items- tempura, sushi (CA rolls and Ama Ebi)- all which were fine.   8. We ordered the bento box dessert- it was ok- not fantastic.   Overall- the meal was great. The black miso cod was so good- it had the right blend of sweetness with saltiness, and the fish was so tender it literally melts in your mouth. The Chilean sea bass had the same texture and effect, but it costs about twice the amount as the black cod (a tidbit for those of you who are watching the $$s).   We had starved ourselves earlier in the day and were totally stuffed by the end of the meal. The whole meal with tip was just over $300. I highly recommend this place. It was the only restaurant that we went to in the older part of Vegas that was great.",

They were not that large, so I was definitely still hungry, but the prices were almost double what I normally pay for sushi.  A couple of the girls ordered the tasting menu which can cost anywhere from $110-150 but was definitely worth it !! You get about 5 sushi plates, 4 dinner plates, and dessert. The portions aren't large, but after all the different items you do get to eat you will definitely be full.  The service here is excellent. Our waiter knew the menu like the back of his hand and each plate that came out he explained what was in the dish. They were very tentative with our drinks and was always making sure we were enjoying our meal.  Next time I will definitely come back to try the tasting menu",

    "text": "Very very good. Hard to say that it lived up to the hype, but I thought the Omakase was good value for $100. I went with my parents and they also ordered the Omakase. The waiter tempted us with the $150 Omakase containing \"dishes not on the menu\", but being our first time at Nobu, we went with the cheaper Omakase. The dishes (as best as I can remember from my pics), in order: (cold-hot-sushi-soup-dessert)  1) Toro with Spicy Miso and Caviar - Wow, definitely one of the highlights of the Omakase. Super juicy, melt-in-your-mouth toro topped with a bit of caviar and sitting in a nice spicy miso sauce. OMG so good. There was an interesting tiny Japanese peach on the side to cleanse the palate.  2) Hawaiian Red Snapper Sashimi - Very nice texture and mix of flavors with the a citrus sauce, spot of spicy sauce, a sprinkle of black sea salt, and . Not sure if it's on the regular menu, maybe it's called something else.  3) Kampachi and Tasmanian Trout Sashimi - Super exotic and tasty. I didn't even know what Kampachi was until I looked it up. Apparently it's Hawaiian yellowtail farmed in the open ocean off the Kona coast of the Big Island. The trout was also very good. It looks a bit like salmon, but tastes a lot better. Served with a nice miso-based sauce (I think) on the side, a couple small veggie sushi rolls, a roasted jalapeno, and a small, yellow, pear-shaped tomato sliced in half.  4) Black Cod w/ Miso - This dish really did live up to the hype. I was about to order it separately in case it did not come with the Omakase, but our waiter said it is normally included in the $100 Omakase since it's a very popular dish. OMG so good. Such delicate flavors and texture. Amazing. I normally don't like to eat fish skin, but this skin is super good and flavorful. The cod is very light and flaky, but not dry. Wow, this is a must try if you come to Nobu.  5) Beef Tenderloin w/ Shiitake mushroom and asparagus - I didn't think this was that special and probably would not order off the regular menu. It was very good tenderloin though, cooked to a perfect medium rare, with a light sauce. It is served in a sizzling mini cast iron plate.  6) Nigiri Sushi Platter - Delicious nigiri, super fresh, and most pieces I normally wouldn't order myself, but were interesting to try. Tuna (best I've had in awhile), Japanese snapper, Aji, giant clam, and sweet shrimp. Mmm  7) Miso Soup w/ Clams - Pretty standard miso soup with a few clams inside. The clams and miso is a good combination, but they can be tricky to fish out and eat with only chopsticks. I cheated on one of them and used two fingers to hold the shell. ;P  8) Flourless Chocolate Cake w/ Green Tea Ice Cream - A generous portion served in a cute bento box. Nothing too spectacular or interesting, but delicious nonetheless. The cake was still nice and molten inside when it arrived. Yum!  A pretty filling flight of dishes for $100. I thought it was good value to try many dishes, but I haven't seen the sizes of the normal dishes. Many tables around us also ordered the Omakase, as I heard the same descriptions being recited by the staff over and over. I over heard a table of French tourists behind us ordering California rolls, chicken teriyaki, tempura, and other generic stuff you can get anywhere. Sigh, what a waste.  I would recommend not to order anything not on the \"hot\" of \"cold\" specialty pages of the menu. The rest is basically traditional Japanese fare you can get anywhere, but will probably taste better and cost a lot more at Nobu. Service was good, polite, and attentive. It was a bit odd when our waiter brought out the first few dishes, and then a couple other different guys brought out some of the following ones. Weird.  The decor is basic, but nothing too special. The sushi bar looks cool and there's a pretty wall of bamboo poles at the back as you walk in. My parents like to eat early, so we moved our reservation to 6pm when they are supposed to open. When we arrived a few minutes early, the door was locked and they didn't seem ready yet. Ten minutes later, they were ready. Better to come early though, or your Omakase may take two hours or longer to get through. Ours took about 90 minutes because it wasn't that crowded until after 7.  I think the tenderloin and dessert could have been better and more creative. Otherwise, nearly flawless.  If I ever return for a special occasion, I will definitely need to try the $150 Omakase. With the economy in shambles, I kinda feel bad eating such an expensive dinner. Fortunately, my parents picked up the tab tonight as I had paid last night at the Painted Pony. Maybe in 2009 they will have a recession special, like Gray's Papaya. ;P",

    "text": "Nobu was my first experience at a Michelin rated restaurant (one star).  Omakase is the Japanese term for trusting the chef to come up with an enjoyable meal whether it's sushi or a classic European cuisine.  It's an exciting way to try the more creative and special dishes from the chef's knife.  It requires about two hours for dinner but well worth the time.  When you order, you'll be asked about allergies and this is a good time to mention the types of seafood that you don't like.  If your party is four or less, I recommend siting at the sushi bar.  We luckily sat in good view of the lead sushi chef and watched his amazing knife and prep skills.  He was very focused in his tasks but explained each round of courses personally.  There is a high level of construction/presentation involved with each dish so I was in awe of his techniques.  One really surprising thing was the appearance of black caviar, white truffle slices, kobe beef, and foie gras during the run of courses.  All those fantastic flavors in one sitting.  My friends and I opted for the $150 per person course.  There is a $200 option too.  Having lived in the Seattle area most of my life, I've been able to enjoy really good sushi restaurants.  However, I was astounded by how good the dishes are at Nobu.  Insanely good flavors and worth the price jump.",

I attended with a good friend of mine who has ALWAYS raved about their cucumber martinis.  Each time I would go out to eat with him at ANY restaurant he would ask for a cucumber martini in hopes of finding a place that could make one half as good as Nobu.  He kept failing at that mission.  I was made to try each time he got one and always ended up chasing the taste with a glass of Rieslings or whatever I was drinking at the time.  I am, by no means, a martini fan.  That was until I FINALLY had a cucumber martini at Nobu.  If a drink could be described as refreshing and light, this would be the one.  I had 3 that night and would've had more if I wasn't in 5\" heels and thought I'd break my ankle if my drunky self tripped.  My friend, smartly left the decision of choosing items up to our waiter, Chris, and am I thankful to Chris's knowledge of the menu and checking in with us on what was to our liking and not.  From what I remember of the evening we had:  Spicy Miso Lotus Chips with Big Eye Tuna-Delicious Black cod with miso in a lettuce wrap-Delightful Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno-Awesome California Roll-Too full to eat Some sort of mac & cheese dish with shrimp-Underwhelmed  Not only did I enjoy myself, my food, my company, and my waiter, but it was a great place for people watching.  My friend and I spent half the time chatting about topics pertaining to us and the other half commenting on the people we observed and conversations we overheard.  I will DEFININTELY come back to Nobu when in town or when in a city one is located in.  Viva la Nobu!",

I particularly recommend the tuna and jalapeno sashimi (and I don't normally eat raw fish, but I wasn't going to pass it up this time) and the cod that comes on a lettuce leaf with a little shredded, toasted phyllo on top.   Our waiter was patient with us, and helped us decide even though we were a bit clueless. The service is fast once you make up your mind about what to eat; and we ordered in waves, which the kitchen was fine with.   The only reason this wasn't a 5-star experience is that the room is small, crowded, dark, and noisy. We were literally reading the menus with the lights from our cellphones. The price of everything probably also weighs into my decision not to give the place 5 stars. For five of us to eat enough not to be starving but not to be totally full either was more than $300, and that includes one drink apiece.",

So, why not eat the \"speciality\" things they are known for rather than food you can always get at another restaurant.  So, I ordered the yellow tail sashimi with jalapeno, the Salmon Tataki with Cilantro Dressing, Lobster Ceviche, and my FAVORITE THING IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD= the Black Cod with Miso lettuce wraps!

(I know it sounds very sexual but once you have this dish, you too will feel like you had a sexual encounter in your mouth!  -THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID!)  I say if you ever have that one night when you want to go fancy while your in Vegas and don't mind spending the money and want a VERY delicious experience, you need to go to Nobu at the Hardrock!

The three of us agreed on what we wanted and away we went. Out of what we ordered there are two highlights, the yellow tail with jalapeno and the Kobe beef. Again, none of the rolls were spectacular; in fact we sent one back because it tasted too fishy. I didn't feel it was worth what I spent, and felt I have had better sushi in Colorado and Houston!

    "text": "Ate here solo due to boredom after my friends left Vegas early, and I ordered omakase at the bar.   First, the taste and quality: Nobu chef imbue their creations with a South American touch, using unique spices and pairings. I would consider it Japanese-South American creative tapas. Delicious and intriguing creations which had me closing my eyes and savoring the novel tastes. I hoped to prolong the moment as long as possible before the inevitable gulp and swallow. The meal felt like a 10 act performance, although I was a bit disappointed that the first half completely outshined the closing half.  Service: waitstaff was like a ninja, darting from the shadows behind me to assist at every opportune moment (in the first half of the performance). Halfway through, the chef no longer personally created my dishes and they arrived straight from the baxk of the kitchen. At this point, waitstaff became slightly disinterested and less ninjalike.  Ambiance: modern, dimly lit, but nothing extraordinary. It could pass for any old sushi joint in the bay area, CA.  Value: at $250, sooo not worth it. I think I have had superior omakase from small lesserknown restaurants in the OC for 1/4 the price. Omakase in Tsukiji Japan is superior in quality and freshness for 1/4 the price, too. Omakase from the world-famous Jiro in Tokyo is about $200 more, but worth it for bragging rights and last meal on earth status.  Verdict: unless you are very bored, skip this place, save your money and spend it where it will go a heckuv a lot further. I am curious about the Nobu hotel at Caesars, though...",

Here's what I have to say....3.5 stars  I'm a lot more wordy than hubby so get ready....  Our waiter was snooty.  The prices are beyond outrageous.  The menu was extremely complicated.  I am no Japanese dining expert, but I've eaten at my fair share of Japanese restaurants from fine dining to hole in the wall and for the life of me I could not figure out how to order off of this menu...even after asking the waiter a barage of questions.  It didn't help that we were dining with 2 other couples, one of which did not want to be there, and half of the other couple didn't even like Japanese food...don't ask.  I digress.    The food we did figure out how to order was pretty damn good.  The rolls were good, the tuna sashimi fresh and delicious, the tempura was cooked perfectly....and the chili beef and teryiaki chicken all very good.    But the 2 best parts about Nobu for me were the Belini Martini's (I had two to kick off my night of martinis) and the Bento Box dessert.  The dessert was absolutely heavenly.  A flourless chocolate cake filled with a warm ooozy chocolate sauce topped with fresh raspberries and served with a scoop of green tea ice cream, it was one of the best desserts I have ever had!    It's too bad hubby says he won't go back. I think if we had ordered differently and accepted the fact that it costs a small fortune to dine here, we might get to a good solid 4 stars.",

    "text": "Went I went to this particular Nobu four years ago, it was outstanding. Perfection on all front. Really some of the best food and service I've ever had. Since then, I'm not quite sure if my palate has become more discerning and/or Nobu has lost just a little of it's shine. Either way, it was still a great meal overall.   Hubs and I made a reservation here for my birthday dinner while in Vegas. We put a note in the reservation stating so and while it's not a huge deal, we didn't hear happy birthday from our host, server or receive any sort of birthday love. Our server was just fine, although he didn't seem to be the happiest of lads. Maybe he was having a rough night. Regardless, we went on an ordering spree and here's what we snacked on...  Jalapeno hamachi: 5/5: Bright, flavorful and incredibly fresh. Exactly what I remember about Nobu!   Ehu: 4/5: Per the server a new-ish item on the mean, ehu is a short tail red snapper. I've yet to taste ehu before, but it's a flaky white fish. Taste overall was a bit overworked with multiple elements on the plate, but it was tasty.   Rock Shrimp: 3/5: Last time I was at Nobu, hubs and I ordered two servings of this. Not heart healthy but it used to be creamy and delicious with the shrimp perfectly flash fried. This go around it was clumpier, sticker and not quite as creamy.   Black Cod: 3/5: Another dish that I used to love. This visit the cod was watery and lacked the complex flavor the miso previously provided.   Spicy Tuna Roll: 4/5: Standard spicy tuna. Fresh, delicious and on the mark.   This visit was a good one but not a great one overall. I'm still a fan of the ambiance and the creative menu items so here's hoping I came on an off-ish night!",

The waiter asked if we had any food allergies, and what our preferences were.  No food allergies, and preferably no raw tentacles.  From that moment on, it was one exciting dish after another.  The order of the dishes were cold, hot, sushi, and dessert.  We were so stuffed by the end of the night, that we couldn't even finish the dessert.  Not that the dessert wasn't good, it was just a lot of food.    The environment was cozy but chic.  The staff were friendly.  One of my favorite restaurants.  I am looking forward to Morimoto's one of these days.",

My co-worker, we'll call her Shirley, put her betting face on and said to herself, \"Ok, we'll see your AJs and raise you a Nobu\" and off we went to plan B.  We arrived at Nobu during a bustling dinner hour but were promptly seated at a table sans reservations, btw, Shirley was looking hot as was our server whom we advised to surprise us with the sushi and to keep it coming.  I can't even tell you what we had since a lot of it wasn't on the menu, but most of it revolved around a spicy tuna or halibut creation of some sort since we told him that that was what we really liked fish-wise.  And the dishes we got were divinely yummy!  Now I don't know if Vegas is a good place to judge attention of service when you're dressed for the town in heels that can double as a weapon, but I've always had exceptional service at the 2 Nobus I've been to (try the Nobu at the Intercontinental Hotel in Hong Kong if you get the chance) and the sushi & sashimi has always been creatively presented and fresh.  Now the story ends with Shirley and I winning our heady bet by our check averages per person, but it was worth every shot of sake for the trouble we got it in back at the office ; )",

The quality of the ingredients did not warrant the prices. 3. Since everything is ordered on a per piece basis, it makes ordering a litIe cumbersome - who really wants to order tempura on a per piece basis? Especially since it is the same assortment of tempura you would get anywhere else.  I eat Japanese food fairly often, so I know my way around... and this was definitely not up to par.",

But who cares when you're on the strip; expensive is expected. :P   Nobu stands out from the rest of the sushi chains because of their creative entrees. Based off their Chilean Sea Bass and Black Cod dishes, I'm quite impressed and have confidence that any of their dishes would be a good pick. These dishes were well prepared and were not drenched in sauce. Their raw fish tastes as if it's fresh from the ocean; definitely close to what you can get in Japan. However, the quality of their fish is what closely resembles Japan not the restaurant itself as their menu, interior decor and waitstaff is like any other American restaurant.",

    "text": "When I criticized Morimoto Napa for being like a \"Vegas restaurant,\" I now realize I was astral-projecting into the future and referring to this one.  Chef Nobu has a signature, Peruvian-influenced style, and it seems to be coupling proper technique and great ingredients with a bunch of overpowering and discordant flavors.  Uni tempura is amazingly good, although the price ($16 for one piece) and the questionable accompaniments (the obligatory deep-fried shiso leaf) put it far down the value-for-money ladder.  The tataki plates of Kobe-\"style\" beef are great and totally worth the price.  They're an especially great maneuver for large parties, since the steak is so thinly sliced it's easily shared.  King crab tempura is nicely made but there's way too much acid from the ponzu.  The same goes for the lobster salad; it's far too acidic, the flavor of the lobster was lost.  But the pasta aspect was nice; great texture.  The black cod with miso is probably a reverse of the chef's intentions:  it's really miso with black cod.  Miso is a tricky ingredient; in this dish it's just completely overpowering; it seems like approach is to simply rub the miso on directly.  That's a risky tactic and it doesn't really pay off; it was hard to get through more than a few bites.  And I *love* miso.  Maki in its various forms are served with -- incredibly -- a side of ponzu sauce.  That's a first for me.  I'm not sure I get the logic behind it.  The special house rolls e.g. with jalapeno are tasty enough, but generally the additional flavors don't complement the fish very well.  The sushi itself is perfectly made.  The knife work and rice preparation and rolling are impeccable.  Nobu is a bit flashy and it's to be expected from a restaurant chain that's co-owned by a celebrity chef and an actual movie star.  It's also to be expected from Las Vegas.    I'd certainly recommend Nobu for the more traditional fare:  it's essentially authentic and very well-made.  I don't think I'd recommend much beyond that.  Japanese cuisine, being one of the greatest in the world, doesn't need fixing or innovation.  Nor does it need an additional side of ponzu sauce.",

The Bento Box consisted of white chocolate sauce in a flourless chocolate cake, with green tea gelato and berries on the side.  A little excessive yes, but it was effective.  The first couple of rounds of the omakase were the cold dishes, which were acceptable, as I expected small portions of dishes to come out.  However, I was surprised (and almost annoyed with the second half of the omakase, which consisted of warm dishes that basically over-powering and excessive.  They could pretty much act as their own entree.  tl;dr  The cold dishes are tiny, the warm dishes are a whole lot.  With that said, the price of $110 is worth the 8-course meal, but I was slightly annoyed at how small and then how big the proportions were.

Can you accommodate us, tonight?\" *crossing fingers* Nobu: \"See you at 8 o'clock, tonight.\" Me: \"Whew!\"  Trying to make a reservation for 12 last minute is Las Vegas (of all places) is crazy.  Leave it up to the boys, and nothing will get done.  Lesson learned!  Anyway, NOBU!  Where have you been all my life?  This is by far one of the best dinning experiences--hands down!  Our waiter asked us how much we wanted to spend per person and built a menu based on our dollar amount.  The first course arrived, and the boys made a comment of how they would have to hit up a McDonald's since the portions were so small.  The courses got better and better as the meal progressed.  When the check came, the waiter stayed under our budget (with alcohol) and the boys left with full tummies.  Thanks, Nobu!  I'm definitely looking forward to dinning here again.  P.S:  SIX WORDS: BLACK COD WRAPPED IN BUTTER LETTUCE!",

    "text": "Went here on Valentine's Day for a company function and I am going to say--hands down--the best japanese food/sushi in my entire life! None of the dishes disappointed me and I couldn't wait for each dish to come out as they got better and better as the meal went on.   Supposedly the owner of the company that took us here is a big deal so we got excellent service. The waiters and the chef knew who he was so we got taken care of. I went to show someone where our table was (literally not even a minute) and my napkin was refolded at my seat.   This is what we had:  -Edamame -Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno -Rock Shrimp Tempura with Cream Spicy Sauce -Rock Shrimp Tempura with Butter Ponzu -Black Cod Miso -Chilean Sea Bass with Dried Miso -Beef tenderloin (medium rare) in a claypot -Mushroom soup -Pickled Sushi Platter   -Sushi platter -Ceviche with mixed seafood (and quail egg) -Fish egg sushi with quail egg -Sweet potato and avocado tempura -Dessert: Chef's Tasting Platter  Alcohol: I had a mango martini--delicious! I don't really like to taste alcohol, but this was a good sweet/tart drink that got me slightly buzzed. Good tasting + getting buzzed = winner!  Some highlights of the meal:  -The seafood was amazingly fresh and it was the best quality I've had. My top favorite was the black cod miso and the chilean sea bass. Melt in your mouth HEAVEN.  -Beef tenderloin was perfection--I love my meats medium rare and it was good and bloody.  -I did a shot of the ceviche with a raw quail egg and it was great. You only live once, and if you want to try something might as well do it at Nobu since they know how to prepare it properly. Bottoms up!  I'm so glad I went with a company because there is no way I would have been able to 1. afford all of this food and 2. to order this many plates. Nobu is great and I would gladly go back if I had the chance!",

They had my favourite wine (joh.jos. prum) which they seem to only have in 1/2 of their locations. The prices at this location seemed to be on the high side. $40 for 2 pieces of toro sushi, which is usually a staple for me but i decided to pass on it)  Food Yellow tail Sashimi with Jalapeno  Nobu style tacos- beef and tuna beef tataki Tenderloin of Beef Toban Yaki- yummy toro and scallion roll  I would highly recommend any of these dishes",

You're there for an experience you'll remember for some time, and that's pretty priceless.   Won't go through all the numerous dishes we tried, but each somehow seemed better than the last and the sushi and sashimi just evaporated on your tongue. The waiter chatted to us about budget and what we like and then we left it to him to just keep the food coming. He was similarly helpful on the drinks front, helping me pick some Japanese whiskeys that perfectly complimented the food.   One thing that raised our eyebrows was the inclusion of the Australian Beef dish...only because when we got the itimised receipt it was by far the most expensive thing on there... and as a table of seven traveling Aussies it was odd paying that much for something so common to us back home. Note to myself to remember next time to ask at the start for them just to stick to the fish dishes as they are far superior to the beef in my opinion, and much better bang for your buck.  Other than that, it was a fantastic evening. Strange walking out of there into the neon slot machines of the casino, but that's Vegas.",

He also asked us what we preferred and if at any time during the tasting we loved or hated an item that he will adjust the rest of the menu accordingly. Each dish was perfect.  The ambiance and atmosphere of the restaurant made me feel like I wasnt even in the Hard Rock. The customer service great. Shane was very knowledgeable and accommodating.

This dish is a signature and is undeniably one of my favorites in the world. Super tender and the perfect combination of savory and perfect kick from the fresh jalapeno! The Rock Shrimp are just amazing with a creamy sauce and again with a perfect bite at the finish. Our server offered a variation of my favorite black miso cod- small portions served on butter lettuce cups that rocked so much I ordered a second.   For our special adventure we opted for the Hearts of Palm pasta- again a kick and for me interesting but not a fav yet Clarence loved it! Last and should have been first was their Miso soup- probably the best anywhere , served piping hot and I enjoy it as a finish.   The Wagyu Beef was so tempting but I passed. It is hard for me to order a dish equivalent to two new pairs of shoes... Honestly we have never been disappointed in a Nobu splurge. I was pretty full before the table next to us ordered it and caused me to have food envy but there is always next time.   Aaron was a super knowledgable and very attentive. The team of secondary servers were all on point. Huge kudus to the whole team here from start to finish with a standing O for the chef and kitchen too!",

    "text": "This is a review of the groupon deal dinner.  The Skinny: fusion Peruvian Japanese dishes left me unimpressed (3) service: excellent service despite the disappointing cuisine (5) value: for the Groupon, it is still overpriced for what it is. So you can imagine what I have to say about full price ... not worth it (2.5).  So here's the deal. We spotted the Nobu groupon for $95/2 person (regularly $150) prix fixe menu and we thought \"how can we pass this up?\".  We went and were seated prompty. Our server was great at giving us time and space to make some decisions on the menu. We ended up getting in addition to the prix fixe an order of their vegetable tempura to round out the menu. The specials that they offered didn't really appeal - there was a lot of fruit/candied nuts mixed in with sashimi which sounded overly sweet to me so I passed on those.  Starting with some simple edamame with Maldon sea salt (love those flakes!), it was a nice way to start a meal.  Course 1) yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno/cilantro (6 slices): this was a good dish but not exceptional. Although I have had different versions of this before, this is one of the better renditions given the quality of the fish and the strategically correct amount of heat. My only thing with this dish was the actual slices of sashimi itself - the slices were a bit thin and ragged along the edges which surprised me given the supposed caliber of this place.  Course 2) selection of nigri (6 pcs) and a california roll (6 pcs): the nigri was okay - the slices of fish were decent sized. I was despondent when I realized that the sushi rice was a little too overcooked and sticky.  Course 3) rock shrimp tempura: the first bite was good however as we ate, the spicy aioli began to slowly permeate the batter leading to a soggier batter. I think it aioli would have been better served as a dipping sauce rather than dressed on the tempura to retain textural integrity. Flavorwise, this was a nice dish and we loved the mixture of chive and togarashi.  Course 4) miso glazed black cod: candied black cod more like it! Overly sweet, the piece of fish was smothered in the sugary sauce which became more unappetizing the more we worked to finish this. I have made this at home using his recipe with 1/2 the sugar and it is much better.  Course 5) vegetable tempura (added to the Groupon): the tempura was okay nothing special. The batter was slightly spongier than what I like. I think it would have been better if the shredded daikon/ginger was provided to us so we could add as much/little we wanted.  Course 6) normally this would be mochi ice cream except it was my birthday so I got a molten cake with a tiramisu and green tea ice cream. All of them were very good however there was nothing that really wow'ed me to think that it was exceptional.  Perhaps 10 years ago, the level of this fusion cuisine would be considered cutting edge. However time has made his dishes appear quite dated. The signature dishes of rock shrimp tempura/yellowtail jalapeno sashimi/miso glazed black cod are easily found elsewhere - one might argue that this location's rendition is rather lackluster considering the price. Given the many issues with the dishes mentioned above, I cannot recommend this place given the Groupon price let alone full price. Although our server was truly exceptional, that doesn't make up for the food. 2.5 rounded up to 3 starred review.",

But my boyfriend and I were in Vegas with friends so the good company was what brought us in.   For those who want a simple yes/no - YES, if you're looking for a high end place to try and you enjoy sushi than I think Nobu is one of those rare places that's worth it.   Our party of 8 didn't really know what we wanted, so our amazing waiter suggested that he could pick out an assortment of dishes based on our budget. At $100 a person, he said he could give us the Grand Prix. We had dish after dish that included sushi rolls, black cod,  creamy spicy crab, etc. Other people have mentioned the Black Cod - I would just add that my boyfriend made a comment while eating it that every human should taste this succulent piece of ocean nectar. that cod was that good.   One person in our group was vegetarian, and I have to say he was getting some awesome custom dishes! SO MANY OPTIONS FOR VEGETARIANS!  The food was great to say the least. The service was excellent, and the ambiance was lively yet relaxed. There was honestly nothing to complain about. Since you're reading this review, I assume you don't mind the price point as long as its worth it. I would tell you that yes, it's worth it.",

After dinner, he said to me, \"Where I grew up, we were taught not to make a religion out of food.  But, after this dinner, I may become a True believer.\"    Don't think of Nobu as a typical Japanese restaurant -- even though you can order sushi and sashimi.  Think of it as a clever Japanese inspired restaurant that takes familiar flavors and brings them to the next level.  For example, the yellowtail came as very thin, delicate slices with jalapenos and cilantro, instead of wasabi.  The Black Cod with Miso is sublime.  When I asked for a second order, the waitress suggested the cod with pate in lettuce cups.  That was sublime.",

From there they proceeded to bring about a custom menu of a good 10-15 courses over the next 2 hours.  Food excellent, regular sushi will never taste the same again. The service was exemplary.  Our server (forgot his name) was very attentive and friendly.   It wasn't cheap. The entire check for 8 people was around $1,500 and that did not really include many alcoholic drinks.

Service was awesome, from making (and twice changing) our reservation,  arrival & interaction with the hostess, to the amazing wait staff.   In short, there's a good reason Chef Nobu has a ton of restaurants.   We decided before arriving in Vegas that we would have the prix fixe dinner.  Each course was prepared after the next so everything was extremely fresh.  While the plates didn't seem overly complicated when described by our waiter, their relative simplicity worked favorably in creating unique flavors for each item; no flavors were duplicated or even similar to the other dishes served.  Everything they brought was visually exciting, just check out the pictures below.  It isn't exactly inexpensive (by most average standards), but so worth it.",

The cherry on top is the service - from the first phone call to reserve a table for 10 for a Friday night dinner (made a day prior due to a reservation cock-up at Social House), subsequent phone calls to organize the delivery of birthday cake, and the servers during the dinner.    All these made us forget about the $8 cake-cutting fee which, while ridiculous, is somewhat justified.    The damage report came to about $70 per person.  Money well spent, no less.",

    "text": "I can't believe it took so long for a foodie like me to eat at Nobu!   With plans to spend Labor Day in Vegas, I was thrilled with how easy it was to secure an 8pm reservation on the Saturday of a long weekend.  Economy or Vegas?    Boyfriend is a Nobu-phile (who isn't, once they've been?) and so insisted that we order the Yellowtail with Jalapeno and the kobe on hot rocks, but then gave our server latitude to bring us a few other raw dishes.  Every single thing I put in my mouth was outstanding. As noted by the legions of yelpers, the Yellowtail with Jalapeno blows you away--big, bright, fresh flavors that highlight, not mask, the fish.   Next out was snapper with breadcrumbs.  Similar to the yellowtail in that it featured fresh fish adorned simply with bold, savory flavors, but with a totally different flavor profile. The third, and final, cold dish was that day's special: toro served with arugula, a truffle oil-infused dressing and topped with fresh truffle shavings.  I was a bit nervous about this dish, having seen it on the menu, because I love truffles in theory but often find them cloyingly rich and heavy, with a sort of artificial after taste.  This dish induced giggles, it was so good (see Mastro's review for further discussion).  It also induced an epiphany: I dislike truffle oil for the exact reasons enumerated above but I LOVE fresh truffles.  They have all of the best parts of truffle oil (that intense earthy umami flavor) but without any of the fake, sickeningly denseness.  I know, I know: TOTAL white people problem.    Finally, it was on to the kobe beef on hot rocks.  Fun, interactive and tasty as hell.  Lots of sauces and spices to choose from, but our favorite was just sea salt and the Japanese seven spice.  Our waiter (excellent service, incidentally) brought us a 6 oz portion which we finished but couldn't have eaten any more of.  At $27/oz, that's a pricey little entree but definitely a splurge-worthy item if you're looking/able to splurge.  We rounded things out with cocktails in lieu of wine and I definitely appreciated the relative speed with which the meal moved as we had a comedy show to get to that evening.  I left feeling sated, not stuffed, and already thinking about when I could back to Nobu for more.",

Had big expectations( when that happens I am usually disappointed) and ended up with a fun, yet not ethereal experience.  To start sake selections are good and their house pour is pretty tasty too. Wait service was  a bit relaxed in the sushi bar vicinity and I wish they were a bit more opinionated in terms of what to order. We passed on the omakase and moved from there. I don't remember everything we had to order which tells me this wasn't (a)a four star experience plus(b) I wasn't drunk. The only things that stood out to me where the miso cod, which was very good and the jalapeno hamachi dish which had good balance. I thought the menu overall would be a bit more innovative; in the end it seemed standard. Curious if his namesake restaurant Matsuhisha in LA pushes the envelope more? Restaurants such as Kiss in SF are a lot more fun for the sushi experience.",

    "text": "Sooo, I made reservation this monday at Nobu, with high expectation and hope... I was expecting excellent quality fish from the price they were charging.  I went to Vegas to eat here... I was expecting to spend alot of money too.   However... when i walked in, the resturant looks nice and hipp, was pretty busy for a monday night. We made reservation but they tried to sit us in same booth right next to another customer so we decided to sit at sushi bar.   Server was super friendly, knew his menu well, sushi chiefs were all Japanese and friendly/helpful as well.  I ordered one of recommendation from the server, and Toro Tara to start with, still excited!  I got bit suspicious when toro tartar came from kitchen, instead of sushi bar, it looked amazing with ice, caviar, lil bamboo shoot garnish and side of Yama-momo japanese plum.  When I see the actual Toro... I was more suspicious because of the color of the fish... it just didn't look like toro to me at all... I took a bite hoping to hop with joy, instead i had to look at my dish again... to make sure it was BLUE FIN TORO TARTAR.... I swear, its a scam, i had blue fin toro and good toro many times in my life time, but it is not a blue fin toro! It tasted like regular crappy tuna grinded up like a baby food.  argh... you don't understand the disappointment... coming all the way from phx to eat at THE NOBU... and this is what i get. =/   I had Uni sashimi, which was not that fresh, not so bad but for the price they charge, it should been better, Negi-toro was decent, it was real toro at least, not Tartar baby food crap.  King crab ceviche was just too sour... killed the flavor... after that, i didn't want to try anything else, but i had kabocha desert... which just tasted like normal pumpkin cake instead of japanese kabocha...   presentation was well done, its really beautiful, sushi chiefts are nice, and so are staff there but  food...   just dose not match the price of reputation. come on NOBU-san, you can do little bit better than that =/  I wish i ate at yellowtail or Shibuya instead, I will NOT be going back here again...   but plz ppl, don't try the toro tartar its really a scam =/",

    "text": "let me preface this review by saying that i am NOT a seafood lover. i dislike the fishy taste and smell. so when my friends wanted to do dinner at nobu during our visit to vegas, you can imagine my skepticism.   with that said.................. nobu not only met but exceeded any expectations that i had! every plate that i had was DELICIOUS. everything was fresh, no dirty fishy smell. i even had sashimi for the first time! the way that they pair their foods, whether its the sashimi with a small piece of jalapeno on top and light drips of soy sauce, or the black cod miso (the waiter warned us that no soy sauce was necessary... he was right! the cod looked plain but was marinated with SO MUCH flavor) wrapped in lettuce... or the tempura shrimp with a dash of seaweed sprinkled on top.. AMAZING. i just LOVED the food, the decor, and the presentation of the plates in general.  now, nobu has definitely changed my view and taste (or distaste, at least before!) for japanese food. of course, nobu has also made me a friggin japanese food SNOB, but that just shows that even though their food is pricey, you definitely get what you pay for.  i would DEFINITELY be willing to shell out some serious dough to eat here again.. i wish they had one in the bay area!!!!!",

    "text": "We decided to try this place while in Vegas as I knew the NOBU in New York is the real deal. First of all, it was in a weird location inside the Hard Rock, hard to find at first. We were dressed up a bit for a nice dinner and were getting some stares as everyone in the lobby was super casual. We walked past the slot machines, drunk frat boy almost falling over us, and there, we finally found it. Decor was quite dated and not so impressive for its name. We had wine and sake flights and way too much of it before food but the sashimi is the thing to get here. It's not raw, seared lightly with some delicious sauce. Sushi was very fresh as well. Our waiter was very funny and knowledgeable. Overall, even though it was quite expensive, it was doable according to the Vegas standard and I would return here again so that I can say, \" Can I have 10 plates of sashimi only please!\"",

Sure you don't get the Vegas scene, but you also probably get better service, similar quality and a whole lot more money in left your pocket.  The only brief star of the night was the hostess stand.  Friendly to a fault, they patiently waited for my entire party of 6 a full 30 minutes after the reservation time - and they didn't punish us with a poor table or attitude.  The server was fair - guests at my table had to ask who they had to bribe to get their beer delivered - but what do you expect on a Sunday night at 8pm.....hmmm.  BTW - this restaurant is so noisy you can barely hear people at your own table.  Good luck.",

The bathroom was so far away, I almost ditched my group on the way back to the restaurant (YES, YOU HAVE TO LEAVE THE RESTAURANT TO TAKE A WHIZZ). For those of us distracted by the shiny - Vegas is not the place to put your restroom hiking distance from the bar - your patrons just might not come back.  The service was average, and the food was just slightly better. Can't say I'd go back, but then again, it prob. won't be there when I get back, or it will be filled with Midwestern tourists.",

In each case we had great staff that helped us pick dishes or simply brought what they recommended and the results were off the charts good. These guys have a huge menu and a ton of stuff to offer that isn't printed on the menu, I really think the best way to do Nobu is turning it over to your server to make recommendations. My crew is pretty adventurous eaters although there are limits, that lets us try just about anything. If you are more conservative about seafood and sushi I think it will be hard to get much out of Nobu.  And yes, it is crazy expensive. Crazy. There are lots more affordable meals in Vegas and probably at the Hard Rock itself. There are lots of better price performers in Vegas.   Nobu is great and it is expensive. But isn't total excess exactly what you are looking for and why you are reading this review for your trip to Vegas? If it isn't, there are lots of alternatives.",

    "text": "Black Cod Miso, Black Cod Miso, Black Cod Miso that is all you really need to know. We also had yellowtail shashimi with jalapenos which was very good as well. However, nothing touches the Black Cod Miso. Cons - The place is very loud. Hard Rock Hotel is the loudest hotel/casino in all of Vegas so it is a bit of a given that a place inside would be loud as well. The staff is a bit ridiculous but we just chalked it up to that being part of the show. The staff will try and strong arm you into letting them order for you. Just stand your ground and go for what you want. Also, they will offer you an $11 bottle of Fiji water right off the bat. Smile and refuse and get some free tap water instead. Pros - have I mentioned the Black Cod Miso? The best thing I have ever had pass my lips. The people watching is top notch really every meal on a Vegas vacation should be a dinner and a show. The show at Nobu is one of the best. With the spouse swapping to my left and the wrestling over who picked up the check to my 1 o'clock (no kidding a half nelson and a headlock/nuggie was used) I was laughing a majority of the time. Some people should not have saki. The food is the main reason this place rocks as, it should be. Everything else is just a distraction.",

    "text": "I had high expectation coming in and left feeling somewhat unsatisfied.  While I do think Nobu is a great sushi place to experience, it's a bit over hyped and is priced accordingly..  The place was not well lid so we opted for the sushi bar where we could actually see the food.  Our sushi chef was cool, attentive, and a superb artisan.  I ordered the Omakase ($100) and was pretty happy with the variety of dishes: 1) Toro tartare with caviar - this was the highlight dish .. fabulous! 2) 4 different sashimi dishes - Japanese red snapper, yellowtail and a few others .. exotic varieties, beautifully presented, but a bit overpowered by the sauces .. I left Nobu with a very strong Ponzu aftertaste 3) Black cod .. good but sooooo overrated.  The sauce was just too strong for this delicate fish.   4) Tenderloin with shitake and enoki mushrooms - I really regret asking to have this well done.  Doh! 5) 5 different pieces of sushi - ameabi, grilled eel, and a few others .. all were pretty good.  The waiting service was lacking for a fine dining establishment.  I found that the best waiting services are those that are not very visible but are attentive and will serve your needs before being asked.  Nobu's staff, while very nice, was more of the opposite.  You see lots of guys crowding the restaurant but still have to ask and wait for stuffs.  The predominately male wait staffs also makes me wonder how tough it must be to compete for female employees with the local Cabarets.  Bottom line:  I'm glad I tried Nobu.  But, it'll be a long while before I come back especially when there are so many other options there in Vegas.",

    "text": "I've read about celebrities going to Nobu.  My friend talked about Nobu like it was a god of sorts.  When we found out we had a table waiting for us at Nobu, I was ready to go and feast myself on its delights.  We ordered: The miso black cod, salmon nigiri, a soft shell crab roll, the hamachi and jalapeno appetizer, the mushroom salad, a vegetarian cut roll, and the tiradito.  To drink I had the cucumber martini.  It was seriously one of the best drinks I have ever had.  It tasted like it was made with lychee vodka, and was smooth, refreshing and not too sweet.  Unfortunately our positive experience ended there.  After waiting an hour for our table, we had ordered about 15 cucumber martinis and was dying for some water.  We sat at our table and for 9 people, 2 drink menus were placed on the table and then we were ignored.  I glanced at the menus, waited.  Our waiter came by and I asked him for waters all around and food menus.  15 minutes go by.  We had no water, and no menus.  Finally, we're given 5 menus for 9 people, as he handed me the last menu, he left saying \"We're a little short on menus.\"  We shared our menus and within 3 minutes he was back asking us what we were going to have.  We asked him for some suggestions, and he pretty much just brushed us off.  We finally ordered the hamachi and jalapenos.  Before I could order anything else, he rushes off.  The next time we saw him he is dropping of a plate of hamachi and jalapenos.  Pretty much the whole night, he just ran off with us halfway through ordering and as a result, we were unable to dine together.  I can only speak for the mushroom salad and vegetable cut roll.  The vegetable cut roll was pretty good, I mean, steamed vegetables, wrapped in a cucumber wrap, with a little ponzu sauce.  The mushroom salad was pretty gross.  The mushrooms were varied; trumpets, oysters, shiitake, enoki.  The sauce it was cooked in was sour and as a result made the mushrooms taste bad.  Everyone else thought the hamachi and jalapenos were pretty good, and they loved the miso black cod.  Everything else, however, they said was mediocre.  Mediocreness is ok, if it wasn't coupled with poor service and a $400+ bill.  When the bill came, we inquired about the drinks on the bill as we thought we had taken care of them all at the bar.  His response?  \"No you didn't, but you can just take it out of my tip.\"  I secretly think that everybody raves about this place so much because they don't want to admit they spent that much money on a mediocre experience that you can get anywhere in San Francisco for a quarter of the price.  Overall verdict:  Skip it.  The atmosphere is not really that great, the food isn't really that great, and the service should not be called service.  The Pros: The cucumber martini was super good.",

Don't think that just because a roll has a big rice that is fit for sharing.  I am sure a lot of thought, planning, and preparation that goes into each roll.  If you don't mind paying a lot of money for very good, but small, sushi pieces, then you will be happy.  On the other hand, if you are used to getting a lot of food for your money, you will be disappointed or broke.    You may also want to go to Nobu for its high energy vibe and great atmosphere.  It is inside the Hard Rock Casino that is a younger and livelier crowd than some casinos.  The service is better than average and the decor is very nice.  There are also other entrees other than sushi.  You will save several dollars and get what you pay for if you stick to hand rolls, sashimi or regular sushi (2 pieces).  This will offer you the opportunity to appreciate the high-end atmosphere without high-end prices.",

Thank God, because many Vegas restaurants are infested with smoke from the nearby casino.  lots of bamboo.  Club music.  Loud, people having fun.  No toilet as people have mentioned.  service - excellent, our waiter (Jonathan) was fast and efficient, and the entire staff was fast and efficient.  He did not wait for the 'water boy' to get us water, for example, they all did everything.  One of the faster staffs I have seen in Vegas.  Food - Very good, not out of this world though.  Regular sushi was good, but not better than anything you get in California, NY, or Boston.  You really come here for the fusion \"sushi\", which was very good (but not out of this world).  Recommended.  Everybody should come here once.  And again, it is truly a nonsmoking restaurant.",

While the ambiance is nice, and the food is good (not amazing), the service is too attentive (they are like used car salespeople, always trying to upsell.  Some people just want tap water.), and the food isn't anywhere near worth what they are charging for it.    Better options for Sushi in Las Vegas are \"I Love Sushi\", \"The Ka\", \"Sushi Fever\", or - if you are looking for the Nobu atmosphere without the hype, try \"Sushi Roku\", which has an amazing view of the strip.  The wait staff at \"Sushi Roku\" at Caesars Palace is far more humble and focused on service than \"Nobu\".",

My sister received her dinner long after I was finished with mine. The other big problem was that the restroom were out in the casino across the way, once you got back the food was cold because you had to navigate your way through the casino to find the bathrooms.

Feeling a bit clubby in our dresses, stillettos and all of our long hair.... WE decided to sit at the sushi bar (I admit I would hate if my clan showed up with the 'here we are' attitude on Sat nite wanting to be seated amongst the mix AND now, dammit!)... The chef was entertaining and suggestive of many sashimi choices and sushi options... he just said, 'hed take care of us', and the rest followed.. amongst sake... and many, many varieties of sushi/sashimi between my group.. I didnt have one thing that I didnt love!  Pricey.. maybe..worth it..Absolutely..  AND now to Tao..",

Nobu LV felt more like a quicky place to get sushi. The motif of modern surfing really didn't strike me as Nobu like (I've been to the one in Miami and liked it better).",

But I had a spicy tuna handroll - also very good.  My husband ordered the yellowtail collar - I was not a fan of this as it smelled very fishy but he liked it a lot.  Also the edamame was warm with sea salt - never had it this way - very good.  But I am a salt-o-holic :-)  The service was very good.  Our waiter came back enough to check on us without it being intrusive.   I had the Champagne 95 cocktail - yum.  It was a Sunday night at 9:30pm (and closer to 11pm when we left) and it was crowded so imagine Friday and Saturday nights get pretty crazy and since its Vegas there are a lot of late diners.

Nobu was a good experience, although as other yelpers pointed out, why was this in Hard Rock Cafe (seemed kinda out of place) and the kitchy Hawaiian decor, the decor lost one star in my books.

We both decided to get one of the chefs daily selection and one of the creations where they choose from the existing menu. My dining partner also elected to get the sake flight - a presentation of a carefully selected sake to accompany the dish they select for you. Everything was great! We both have our favorites and preferences, but not having been there before, it was nice to have someone else choose the better dishes. I expected to leave hungry. Instead, I was so full I thought I was going to die. Could have done without the final sushi dishes or dessert. This trip was meant to be a search for interesting food. I think we were pleasantly interested. Just two suggestions: go lighter on the sauces. Good fish does not need to be covered up with a heavy sauce. Secondly, change the decor. Wooden tables and cheap wooden chopsticks leave you with a sense of the mediocre not extravagant.",

Although I frequent Japanese and Sushi restaurants this menu contained many things I had never had before. Most of the items are appetizer sized and quite pricey, considering the size (~$14-25). We chose items off the hot, cold and sushi sections.  The yellowtail tartar was great, the lobster ceviche was not so. The tempura rock shrimp were excellent, just a bunch of fried shrimp on a plate (popcorn-shrimp size). We tried the house special (a rainbow roll) and Eel sushi.

They wait and watch your every move and make sure all your needs are catered too. The food is second to none. Must haves (I don't know if it's always on the menu) are the black cod entree which tastes like nothing I've ever had before.

I ordered the cheaper $100 omakase again (which I do believe is a good deal given the amount of food you get) but the quality of fish has gone downhill since my last visit.  The signature hamachi with jalapeno?  Devoid of all velvety tenderness.  The salmon sashimi?  Like chewing a rug.  The maguro nigiri?  Stringy and tough.  On top of it all, I ventured out and tried the hamachi kama.  Not bad, but terrible for $20.  In San Diego, you can get the same size hamachi kama with every bite just as, if not more, succulent for $9.  There is no excuse, honestly.  If you are going to charge me $20, you better make sure not a single sliver of white meat is dry.  Half the fish was, but luckily there was dipping sauce to keep the meat from being unbearable to the palate.  Nobu isn't a complete loss, though.  Like I stated before, the omakase is a great deal, price wise.  It comes with the famed bento dessert, which was even better than I remembered it being last time.  We also tried the miso almond cake and edamame ice cream, which was great in that it was unique and creative (the taste, quite honestly, was *salty*), but it all paled in comparison with the flourless chocolate cake crowned in green tea ice cream that is the bento.  Never be tempted to order a different dessert here at Nobu.  Ever.  Same goes with the black cod.  Yes, it's small and yes, it's expensive if you order it a la carte, but it's worth every luscious bite.  It should be a must-order if you come here (it comes with the omakase, but it's so good, you should probably just order another).  One item not part of the omakase menu is the uni tempura set.  Perhaps the deep frying hides any flaws in the uni, but I could taste that warm sweet flavor that I know is associated with high quality freshness.  Gotta love the juicy mushroom and refreshing shiso that comes with it too.  The set is also accompanied with a set of delightful salts, all used to enhance in my opinion, what needs no enhancement.  Still nice to look at, though, and they make for some good pictures!  I also tried one of the eponymous sakes and was impressed.  Can't remember which one, but the price was reasonable.  Wonderfully smooth and paired well with the fish.  I highly recommend that you get it served hot.  While I maintain an A-OK for Nobu, I doubt I'll be coming back.  There are other places to get better Japanese food--and for better prices.",

    "text": "It is hard to find good quality fish in Las Vegas being that we live in a desert and our nearest lake is radioactive. But Nobu manages to find some high quality and good tasting fish. So far this is the only Japanese restaurant in a Casino that I have actually liked.    The Bluefin toro Tartar was really fatty which I love and it was sitting in a wasabi sauce that was amazing. With the caviar on top it is one of the single best bites of food I have had.   If you go I would stick to the specialty items on the menu and not order the sushi. You can get near equal quality sushi for less money at other places and it will fill you up faster so you wont get to enjoy their menu as much. Also, the black cod with miso was sooooooo good. The fish melted in my mouth and didnt fall apart when I put a fork to it.   The Saki selection is small but the ones we tried were great.  The lack of 5 stars is due to the fact that we ordered Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno was soaked in sauce and there was no resemblance of fish in the dish. Everything else we had we loved though.",

Now to the food, since it was my first time there the server recommended I try their specialty dishes. Which I did and was floored by the flavors, started with the yellow tail sashimi with Jalapeno, to the black cod miso. Now I did stray from the servers recommendation and ordered the Chef's sashimi which was ehh. Next time I will certainly follow the servers recommendation and would recommend to stick to their signature dishes. What made up for the ok sashimi was dessert and there are many to choose from, I ended up going with the Vanilla Tapioca. Sake was a bit pricier than usual but well worth the money. Service was slow but perfect to enjoy a nice dinner and discuss the evening's events with your companion.  All in all, I would definitely return and try their Beef Wagyu Beef or other signature dishes. Note this is not a cheap dinner by any stretch and expect to spend at least 150 per person but well worth it for the atmosphere and the experience.",

    "text": "Whatever god you believe in, thank them for the creation of Nobu, because dear lord it is by far and away The BEST SUSHI I've ever laid my taste buds on! It may also happen to be the most expensive sushi on the planet, but it if you love sushi, it is worth every penny!   I would be willing to bet that just about anything on the menu is nothing short of amazing, but my favorites included the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno, garnished with cilantro (which they also offer as a roll) and the Spicy Scallop Roll. Now one of the cool things about Nobu is that not only do they know how to do sushi, but they have perfected a number of imported Kobe/Wagyu beef dishes as well. My favorite was the Wagyu Beef Tataki, which is thinly sliced (similar to sashimi), perfectly marbled, lightly seared beef that requires little to no chewing...I'm telling you, it literally melts in your mouth! My drink of choice was a very refreshing Pineapple Martini, which was the perfect balance to the spice of much of our food selections--if you like a sweet drink, I highly recommend it!  The atmosphere is what I would call \"high class-zen\" with river rocks, bamboo and ambient lighting abound...and it's even more hip and beautiful at night! Vegas has a ton of great restaurants, but if you find yourself with a sushi craving in Sin City, do yourself a favor and rush on over to Nobu...and if your mouth doesn't water over raw fish, head over anyway...it's sure to be one of your best dining experiences in the city!",

Placed in the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino, this place mixes the traditional Japanese seafood restaurant with some urban flair.

I had the sauteed eggplant, while my friends had other dishes with some sake on the side. Had an asahi beer too.  The ambiance was never quiet, but it fit the bill.  The tab came out to over $100, but I guess it works for them.  The service was spot on, and the server automatically poured our beers without asking into a cup.  Thought that was pretty regal.  Other than that, I wouldn't say it sucked.  But yet, it didn't give my seal of approval either.  Granted that it was expensive, I could've used the money for other things, like gambling.",

I adored the oyster shooters (the perfect starter) and the sashimi the most. Tried toro, salmon, and yellowtail with jalapeno- all tasted so fresh and exotic with the ponzu and spicy flavors. White fish with chili paste was a close second to the sashimi platter, Wagyu beef incredibly tender.  Also, did I mention the drinks were phenomenal? The lychee martini was good and strong, the cucumber martini was refreshing, the mango and passion super sweet and fruity (would suggest for a fruity drinker) and last but not least the favorite drink was the Hakka Nigori. The Hakka Nigori was like a Mexican mojito but instead with sake- chilled, minty, strong and delicious! The ambiance made me feel like I was in a Japanese hole-in-the-wall restaurant.  The service was fantastic and our server helped us decide what to order on the menu. I would go back again and completely trust my server with the menu and have them decide for me, they're that good! Great service, top 5 favorite restaurants in Vegas and I will be back. Can't wait to try Nobu Caesars location!",

Total change of scenery here.  Very Loud and casual.  I should have known being that its in the Hard Rock Cafe, but I thought people would step it up here.  Had to knock off a star just for ambiance, & price (i dont mind paying high prices, but I expect a total experience for the price I pay)    Had to knock off a star for the food.  The Black cod with Miso was good but my was a little slimy and quite a couple of bones I had to pick out. For the price and caliber Nobu touts to be there should be no bones. The glass of wine we got tasted old also.     Luckily the Yellowtail sashimi w Jalepeno was still the highlight.

Atmosphere is terrible, decor is very dated, servers are attentive but a little way too salesy, and yes, it's expensive, which in and of itself isn't the problem...the problem lies in the actual VALUE you are getting, which is awful.  I've been to much better sushi restaurants in Portland (Bamboo really resonates right now) and paid 1/4 the price for frankly better sushi.  We actually ate beforehand just bc we didn't want to drop $450 on dinner and wanted to try a few things, my lady is pregnant so she can't drink, and I had A....as in 1, single drink and we had 4 single serving sushi items.  We were there for 20 minutes and our bill was NORTH OF $150.  I get that this restaurant isn't cheap, but cmon, I felt like I was bent over and just plowed in the backside (no lube, this was a dry run) as I was walking out....my lady felt the same.

This was a sponsored dinner, so these comments are void of any financial influence.  Tuna tartare on a lotus root chip. Decent - tuna was ok, not too fatty. The chip had some kick to it. Back to back sashimi dishes. Boring. Fish was ok, but smothered in ponzu.  Squid and mushrooms - quite tasty. Squid perfectly cooked. Earthiness to the shrooms. Lettuce cups with miso cod and grilled scallop. The best dish of the night. Some kind of spicy rock shrimp with a mayo dressing on top of a bed of greens. It wasn't bad, but not quite what I wanted. The greens were good. Steak - not Kobe, but damned good. Heavily seasoned. Finished with Calif roll and spicy tuna roll? Are you kidding me? Beer and sake flowed; service was good. I ate here many years ago and the service was so bad, but this time they did well.   We had fun as it was a group that hadn't been together in a long time and as I said I didn't pay, but I would say for the money, there is better food in Vegas and better sushi in many places. If I had paid for this dinner, I would probably have knocked off a full star.",

I went with a couple of girl friends, and we took our time, ordered several different things, and even had a birthday dessert brought to us. I remember our waitress being EXCELLENT and I don't recall it being crowded or noisy.   This past weekend, I went again, and things were a bit different. The sushi we ordered was not much better than cheaper places I've been and definitely not my favorite. I don't see where it was worth all the hype. If you're looking to try something new and out of the box, I think this is a good place to do it but if you're a fan of the traditional sushi that you can find anywhere, this is probably not the place.   This will most likely be the last time I go to Nobu...not because I HATED the food, but because I really dislike the clientele. Too many snooty drunk people, talking way too loudly. I couldn't even have a conversation with my friends. The waiter had a very heavy accent which made it near impossible to understand what he was saying. Not really his fault, but because of the loud groups of people nearby, it was pretty unbearable.   Like my friend said, it was just \"ok.\" I was expecting more and walked away more annoyed than anything.",

    "text": "Having owned Nobu's cookbook for years, I was only too excited to finally visit a restaurant of his.  (which means my lazy ass never made anything form the cookbook but my excuse is that some of his ingredients are so hard to find....but I digress).  Drinks: Jyunmai Sake - \"masu\" size (wooden box cup) smooth and lovely to drink YK 35 - \"masu\" size.  This was the most expensive one on their list and boy was it worth every dollar. Note: Masu is served in an overflowing box-cup on a plate.  You finish your cup and then pour what's on the plate back into your vessel.  Food: Monkfish Liver - honestly, not my thing.  I tried but just couldn't get over the fish-flavored paste.  It had caviar on top which I ate.  But my husband who loved it said the sweet miso sauce enhanced the whole thing greatly.  He enjoyed having the dish to himself. Tiradito, Nobu style - sashimi with a dab of hot chili sauce and black sea salt and cilantro.  One of my faves but not for hubby White fish New Style Sashimi - sashimi doused with soy sauce and oil, topped with ginger and green onions. Also one of my faves but had to share this one with hubby.  Sweet Shrimp New Style Sashimi - even better than the above.  YUM.  Hubby let me have most of this one and for that, I'm forever grateful. Uni Tempura - this was the one thing I wanted to try the most.  The shiso wrapped around the uni gave it another facet and I greatly enjoyed this dish...on my own.  More for me!  The accompanying shitake mushroom and salts were delicious. Miso Black Cod - I didn't have high hopes but our server recommended it so we went with it.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The serving size was reasonable.  Four 2-bite pieces served on butter lettuce and topped with crispy noodle things.  Very enjoyable. Scallops with Wasabi Pepper Sauce - Again, a pretty good-sized serving. The sauce was phenomenal although I do wish there was more of a wasabi kick.  I'm no wuss about spiciness but the pepper in this kept choking me up.    Dessert: Caramel Chocolate Mouse - I thought this sounded rather ordinary until I looked at the ingredient list.  Globe of chocolate filled halfway with mousse (very light and delicate), topped with a toffee disc, topped with shiso citrus granite, topped with caramel \"caviar\"; everything sat on top of a thick coconut sauce, dusting of brown powder sugar and crispy Japanese rice.  BEST dish we had all night.  Loved it.  I could have had 3 more.  Service was great with several lapses here and there.  The busboys were impeccable.  Our server got less and less attentive with the arrival of his other tables.  The quality of the food was excellent and did not disappoint.  I'm no stranger to paying several bills for dinner but for whatever reason, I did feel that food was somewhat overpriced here.  Or maybe for what we paid, I thought the food should have been 5-star.",

We had so many things, that I couldn't even tell you everything we tried.  My major complaint - we let the server order.  It's great if you don't know what you want, but the guy ripped us off so badly we wanted to cry.  He saw a party of 6, instant gratuity on a check, and ordered us pretty much the most expensive things on the menu.  When we got the tab, we almost died out of shock, surprise, and instant regret.  I understand that the servers need to make money, but seriously - don't purposely rip your customers off.  I could hardly enjoy such a delicious meal after paying the bill.  Such delicious food can be expensive, it's high quality and reputation can warrant high prices, so my complaint isn't in the cost of the food, it is instead of the ethics of this particular situation.  Not to say that every server here would do this, but to each his own I guess.",

Omakase is the way to go.\r \r The quality of the sashimi here is top notch - very very fresh.  I heard that they cryogenically flash freeze the toro for freshness and it shows.  The cuts of Toro here was excellent - marbelized and tender.\r \r The jalapeno hamachi appetizer thing was really really good as well.  I'll have to start remembering these dish names, seriously.

For appetizers, we decided to go to the Culinary Dropout, so for dinner, we decided to go to the next restaurant, Nobu.  I've heard AMAZING things about this place and knew that it was top notch.  Heck, I've seen it on Keeping Up With The Kardashians. As good as I know the food would be, I also knew the price tag would be pretty hefty!  When we got in, I noticed and array of seating.  Chairs, tables, booths, bar, you name it.  The green back splash of the bar really went well with the light colored wood framing around the rest of the restaurant. You felt like you were at a super trending Japanese restaurant.  It just felt high end!  Our server was nice, but knew we had a bunch to drink.  We put our menu in his hands.  Here's what we got (with prices):  -Kumamoto Oyster with Nobu Sauce  18 -Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno  24 -Oyster Shooter  12 -Salmon Sashimi   24 -Mixed Seafood ceviche  22 -Snow Crab Sashimi Salad  28 -Tuna (Big Eye) sushi 12 -Salmon Sushi 10 -Yellowtail sushi 12  Some of these items came in a sushi platter.  I wasn't too sure how the platting and combination went.  All I know is the fish was SUPER fresh.  The aesthetics of each plate was like a work of art.  I felt like I was a Kardashian! LOL.  Our total bill for 7 people, came to $780. OH-EM-GEE!  For a nice, elegant night, to me, this was worth it.  Such amazing food and great atmosphere.  I will definitely return!",

I have been to one in NY before, and this was as good or probably better, but maybe its just a more recent and therefore more vivid memory.  Well I went for the upper tier Omakase, and did not regret it.  All of it was great, and I highly recommend the Omakase particularly if you upgrade to the tier 2 dinner.  Wow.  The sushi was great too - one really stole the show and needed an encore performance for my table - that was the Barracuda.  Never had anything like it.  Sometimes I have dreams about those pieces of Barracuda.  The dinner was complemented with a Kirin Zero (alcohol free beer), and a ginger beer.  The drinks were outstanding. I have never had a Kirin Zero before, but will seek it out in the future.  If you are staying in the Hard Rock, or want some Omakase, hit it up.  You will not regret it.  Oh yeah...  Bring your Mastercard.  Because memories may be priceless, but the dinner has a price, and this one isn't cheap!",

For around $150-300 (not including bar tab) per person you get family style eating of fresh Japanese food. There are approximately 7 courses brought out, one at a time, a delicious and fresh array.  The raw ahi with a dash of caviar, lettuce wraps, steak on the mini hibachi, etc., was fun to see what would arrive next. The service was impeccable, the place is clean (although I don't like that you have to exit the restaurant to use the restroom) and food quality excellent.  Personally, Japanese is not my favorite and $150/200 pp for me, is steep if I am not loving the food. If you enjoy fresh Japanese, then this place may be for you.",

It is expensive, to be sure, but the food is so worth it.   This is not a \"slap on the feed bag joint\".  It is meant to be enjoyed over a couple of hours.  The plates are small but are meant to be shared with friends. You should order a few plates so that each bite is savored and you get to try multiple kinds of food. Hot and cold dishes with a Japanese/Peruvian flair.   Cold sake in a bamboo pitcher and shot glasses.   We had a few cold dishes...salmon, oysters, edamame, and a couple more.  Hot dishes of black miso cod, sea bass, scallops.....  Bento Box flowerless chocolate cake, green tea ice cream, a peach dish and an apple donut plate that was beyond belief.   Great ambiance, service and food. A delicious treat.",

    "text": "First of all, please choose the right Nobu restaurant.  You should be going to Nobu in Hard Rock hotel.   If your pocket book is a little tight this is not the place I would recommend you to go.   Cold Dishes:  Special: Toro (don't remember what he listed as the garnishes, but it is shown on my pics.  I think this dish was just a little salty. Once, you add all the dressing on top, I like to taste the fish, since it is fresh.) Kelp Salad 13 (this tasted so fresh, added just a little lemon on top of it.  Also, helped w/cleaning the palette for the next course)  Sea Urchin 16 (this is from Santa Barbara, CA which is normally where every Japanese restaurant from the west coast gets there uni from.  Hmmm..this just tasted like any uni I would have gotten at another bay area restaurant probably no more than 12.00.  Oh well, I do love my uni.   Hot Dishes:  Black Cod Miso 37  (this was cooked well and the miso glaze on top was just right)   Geez I forget the server's name, but he was really great!  Knowledgeable about his fish and the menu.  Very upscale and modern experience.  This is the 2nd Nobu location I have been to, first was in Hong Kong.  If you like fresh fish w/a twist of fresh ingredients, you just have to come here and experience the taste.  But don't come here if you are looking for affordable specialty sushi rolls, this is not that type of place.  This was the first time my friend had gone to this restaurant, she said it was the best Japanese restaurant she has ever been to.  I was so pleased to have taken her there 1st.  Hope they do open up in San Francisco soon!",

Seeing as how I had not eaten sushi for the preceding 9 months, it had been on my mind for a long time. And when I want some serious sushi, there's only one place to go - NOBU!  In all actuality, you shouldn't really order off the sushi menu at Nobu - it's good and all, but it's about twice as much as comparable sushi at, say, Osaka. What you really want is the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno, the black cod with miso, and whatever else your perfectly-attentive-but-not-really-there waiter recommends.   Not sure what else I can add that hasn't been said already, but if you're willing to spend the money, Nobu is awesome.   Side note: if you are there early, and have a small party, you can probably find seats in the lounge or at the sushi bar (still full menu). Otherwise, MAKE RESERVATIONS! Just because the restaurant isn't all that full when you arrive, doesn't mean that it is not booked.",

Was a bit caught off guard but I thought it was cute. My server which unfortunately I forget the name of was beyond perfect. Not only was he gorgeous ( ha! ) but he was knowledgeable but when I told him that I was a vegetarian he stood there and came up with options off the top of his head and was very tentative to us! His first recommendation was of a  soy sauce, cilantro, jalapeno, citrus tofu skin dish... literally my new favorite meal. The way the flavors burst in your mouth and dance on your tongue? Anyway the waiter was tall, with like light coloured eyes, with salt and pepper coloured hair  (if you're reading this at all, give this man a raise!) He is the best waiter I have ever encountered in my life. The whole ambiance of the restaurant is perfect! Very clean.  Everyone is tentative and kind! At the end I was informed that there is a Nobu in Manhattan too??? They will be seeing my face soon! Thank you Hard Rock Nobu!",

    "text": "Came here during restaurant week. I love the modern, sleek decor which reminds you of the flagship house in LA.   Okay, now the food. Let me know just preface this by saying, this place should not tote itself as a Japanese restaurant because most people should realize, this isn't. Sure, it's got sushi and stuff but no dice. If you can move past that, then you may enjoy this place.  Tuna tataki -This is good. Lightly seared but has a good taste to it Yellowtail Jalapeno -I'm not a fan of spicy but this does add a nice kick to the yellowtail. Black Cod Miso - This was surprisingly really good. The fish was cooked wonderfully; just the right amount of crisp but moist/juicy flavor to it.  Assorted sushi -This is the most standard dish that you can get at any sushi joint, for 1/8 the price. Miso Soup -I'm only commenting about this because I love how they call it \"sipping soup\" so at first you think you're getting something special...only to realize it's miso soup. Mochi was pretty delicious but I'm sure this was purchased at your local Trader Joes or Mitsuwa.  Anyhow, it's worth stopping by to check out the decor and if it's restaurant week. I would consider this place Asian fusion more than Japanese but eh, if you're craving Asian food and you're staying at the Hard Rock, this is gonna be your best (and only) bet.",

Nobu is the only one that I would optionally go to again.  This is the best sushi I've had. Everything was flavorful and top quality. I can't remember all the dishes I had, but below are the ones I can remember (score out of 5):  -Bug Eye Tuna Lotus Chips 4 -Shishito Peppers 2 (I got a really spicy one!) -Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno 4 -Rock Shrimp Tempura with Creamy Spicy Sauce 4 (Butter Ponzu Sauce 3) -Rice Cubes with Tuna Spread 3 -Sushi Roll with 4 types of fish 5 -BLACK COD MISO 10 YOU MUST GET THIS, IT IS SOOOOO GOOD! -Horchata Flan 3  I would go just for the black cod miso!  The food is great, but the service was lacking. When we sat down we were a group of 5 and a 6th person joined us. When the waiter brought the tuna lotus chips out he said there are only 5 since that's how many you were when you sat down. He easily could have said I'll bring you another, but I had to specifically ask him. For the price, service should be better, maybe because it's still in the Hard Rock.",

We chose to simply have the waiter bring us their wonderful dishes one after another, which is an option on the menu by the way.  It was so delicious.  From torro to sushi, from beef to sashimi, it was simply amazing.    Our group had 9 courses including mouthwatering sushi towards the end of the meal.  What I enjoyed the most was how frequently the food arrived at the table.  Literally, we would finish a dish and about 2 minutes later another would arrive.  It was amazingly choreographed and simply delightful.  Every bite was amazing.    Keep in mind though, the price is significant for 4 people it ran me $800+ including tip and very little alcohol...  Some sake and a few beers were included.    Definitely recommend if you are looking for an evening of being a total foodie.  Every bite filled the table with conversation and a constant hum of \"yum\" and \"oh my\".    Enjoy Yelpers!",

The food and service here are par for the course - I sampled some perennial favorites, including the rock shrimp tempura, crispy rice, new style sashimi, and miso black cod, and all were executed without issue. Service was attentive and friendly, and the interior design is evocative of the old Tribeca location.  However, the restaurant location/setting was disappointing and poorly representative of the brand, to say the least. I have no idea who thought it would be a good idea to open up a Nobu at the Hard Rock Hotel; it would seem that their target demographics do not intersect at all. This is the only Nobu I have been to that has deemed it necessary to post a dress code at the entrance, which only helped minimally.  And rather unfortunately, the restaurant itself does not have bathrooms; one is forced to exit into the casino area to use the public restrooms, which feature needle disposal boxes.",

I was so impressed by how delicious everything we were presented with.   If you're with a bunch of people who have numerous dietary restrictions, Nobu is one of those places where they will definitely cater to your needs.  One of my favorite dishes of the night was the hearts of palm pasta. The Brussels sprouts were absolutely addicting -- very different to the ones I'm used to. There's nothing generic about the Brussels sprouts here.  Our meal for 5 people with sake was $500, with tip.  A really great meal with great service. Our server Dan was superb!

It was worth it! $145 value (I manually calculated it...lol) Amazing 5 course tasting menu that caters to 2 and they are all standard sized portions. Not to mention, everything was insanely scrumptious! I would buy this exact groupon over-and-over again if the opportunity arises.  I've been burned by groupon before, where the restaurant would shamefully treat us like second-class citizens. Nope, not at Nobu - they treated us like VIP from start to finish. We were also celebrating our anniversary that evening and our server and all of the top-notch staff, made sure we enjoyed ourselves. We felt extremely taken care of (plus it was a busy night for them.)  Complimentary to start the unforgettable evening:  + Sparking voss water - bossy!  + Extra plump and sweet, steamed edamame with delicious crunchy maldon salt - savor every morsel  Accompaniments:  + Freshly brewed soy sauce. The flavor was smooth and refined + Fresh wasabi paste - talk about a head kick! Also smooth, bold and wonderful flavor + Crisp pickled ginger - perfect palate cleanser. Not overly sweet or sour, just right  5 courses:  //Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno and cilantro// $25 You better believe it's better than butter. Enjoy a little piece of cilantro in every bite, to brighten up all of the flavors.   //California roll & chefs selection nigiri// $44 Tuna, fluke, salmon. Flip them, enjoy fish-side-down and let the fish just melt on your tongue. Each fish was extremely fresh, sweet, and delectable. Also, I never thought I would say this, but even the simple CA roll was scrumptious! The sushi rice was cooked to mouthwatering perfection. I was so upset when it was all gone.  //Rock Shrimp Tempura with Creamy Spicy Sauce// $24 Extra crispy and battered to extreme perfection. The addicting crunch makes it so wonderful. Subtle spices and perfectly creamy. Make sure to eat it with the spicy arugula and sweet baby greens underneath - they really add in another dimension of flavor!   //Black Cod Miso// $37 The dish that put Nobu on the map - Black Cod Miso with pickled ginger root. Sweet, luscious, and sensational. The fish was prepared with extreme precision.   //Bento Box// $15 Happy anniversary written in beautiful script using white chocolate sauce, with a warm molten chocolate fondant cake garnished with berries, shiso syrup, scrumptious green tea ice cream and a surprising, rich expresso soaked tiramisu topped with a Nobu emblem cracker. They were all beyond perfection. I can firmly state that Nobu also has desserts down to a delicious science.   Nobu offered us an unforgettable dining experience and such a romantic anniversary, we are already looking forward to our return.",

    "text": "First an foremost, save your money.  This place, carefully orchestrates how to take as much money out of your wallet in the shortest amount of time.  Even the simplest items are so overpriced, that I walked away feeling taken advantage of. While the food is good, it is not great.  Plating is pretty, but food is sparse.  Here is where I went wrong. No menu ordering.  The waiter gave us the option to set our price point per meal and he would pick the courses.  Feeling adventuresome and wanting to be cool I said yes, opting for middle of the line $100-$125 per person pricing.  Yes you read that right.  The first course shows up in 2 minutes and 3 minutes later the next course shows up.  I ask the waiter to slow down and he acknowledged my request.  Yet in 5 minutes, another course shows up.  It would not all fit on our table.  The barracuda was just ok (who serves barracuda?).  Finally the 5th course shows up.  It was a Cod piece on butter lettuce.  It was fishy and just not good.  I sent it back, and when the waitress asked why she laughed.  I looked at my better half and we could not believe that she did that.  She did tell our waiter who fairly promptly came over to inquire.  I explained our dissatisfaction and his response was \"some people feel it does tastes fishy, but it is fish\". I pondered talking to the manager but felt it better to discuss it with our waiter.  He did apologize and told us he was absolutely going to take the dish off the bill.  Should not have had to ask, but he needed to  to be much more proactive, considering each course was about $50.  I am glad we took the approach we did because he was a nice guy who really just forgot how much money we were spending.  And we were spending an average amount in this place.  Total bill for 2, which included a couple of glasses of wine each was $345 plus tip.  Ouchy, even in Vegas.",

The waiter asked us our time frame so we wouldn't be late to watch the show. I appreciate the courtesy!  Not 5 stars because I ordered Old Fashioned. It's not as good as I thought it should be.

I've been to this Nobu countless times and always look forward to returning.   The food at any Nobu is consistently out of this world but what makes this location my favorite is the staff. Not only can each staff member be a model but everyone on staff is attentive, efficient, and interesting.   Things to order: - yellowtail jalepeno sashimi - butter lettuce cod - new style toro sashimi - negi toro hand roll  - Kobe sashimi with hot rocks - rock shrimp tempura - soft shell crab special  - artichoke salad (without noodles) - YK35 sake - peach Bellini - Japanese whiskey flight  - coconut-lime sake - bento box  Last time we were in we had Andrew as our server. Super great guy. He gave us some excellent recommendations and was very friendly and professional. I'm going to request to sit in Andrew's section every time I go back.   Of course I wish Nobu wasn't so expensive but I still think it's well worth every penny.",

    "text": "Nobu, a name that echos throughout las vegas when it comes to sushi. I have always heard rave reviews about and was excited to dine here.  Reservations were @ 8pm. The place was filled but was almost dead when it hit 9pmish. I don't think it's hard to dine here without reservation depending on time.  As a person who is a sushi addict, the sushi bar is where we preferred to sit. The chef was very accommodating and all smiles. All cold dish is ordered thru the chef, hot dishes are ordered with the waiter.  Rice: thicker grain compared to regular sushi rice w/ very very minimal vinegar.  Top Recommendations: *Yellowtail with jalapeno! The mini jalapeno was not spicy, but gave a nice crunch with the yellowtail texture.  *Cod with miso! The miso is delicately sweet which enhances the melt in your mouth cod. The recommendation of this dish is not to be downplayed!  *Uni shooter WITH sake. It's a pretty large shot glass and worth it. I hate the taste of alcohol but even tho this shooter has sake, it was sweet.  *Barracuda with miso and vinaigrette  (off the menu). The chef was actually preparing this for another table when we asked what it was. And behold, he said it's not on the menu!! (This is why sitting at the bar is awesome!) Glad we tried this. The sweet miso flavor and tang really made this fish stand out.  Other nigiri tried: mackerel, kohada, uni (sea urchin), sweet ebi (shrimp), octopus, tuna, tamago (egg), toro. These were pretty good and some above average, but not enough for me to order again if I ever visit again (except maybe if they still have otoro).  Dessert: mochi ice cream. Kinda worth it if you're in the mood, but it tastes just like the mochi ice cream sold in supermarkets.  I was iffy between 3 or 4 stars. I'll be nice and keep it at 4 because service was nice. My gripe is the price!! Ugh almost paid just as much here vs a michelin star sushi restaurant in SF which was superb quality compared to Nobu. I felt ripped off when i found out their uni (sea urchin) came from Cali and not Japan. C'mon Nobu! It's not hard to get sushi from Japan, esp for the price you're charging.   Verdict: eat here if you want above average sushi with creative dishes-- and just because you're in vegas!! But if you are a die hard sushi fan like I am, you know you can get better top knotch quality sushi at a way cheaper price.",

Also, if nothing else, you must try the black cod miso. It has to be the best tasting fish I've ever had.  It was one of those entrees that leaving you yearning for more, and so of course we got more. Money well spent.  I also had the wagyu gyoza, which wasn't bad but after the black cod was just, ehh.

The dim lighting was adequate, but there was something about this place that was intimidating. Yes the tables and the space just didn't make sense, everyone is to close to each other! I mean they charge an arm and a leg for the food but they can't provide space and a little more privacy. I fell for the hype. This is why I can't give Nobu the badass seal of approval. Moneywise for Peruvian Japanese fusion look elsewhere, you won't be disappointed. Will I be back to retry the experience? Eh Maybe.",

The menu needs to explain a bit more about main ingredients than just categorizing food as cold and hot. I had spicy edamame which was not complementary as in some Japanese places. The edamame had peanut soy sauce on it and it was yum. Then I had two orders of rainbow roll since the rolls are much smaller. Plus points for staff attentiveness but be ware of the mystery hand coming from behind and removing unfinished drinks. Prices are steep and portions are small but there's quality and freshness in every bite. Taste profile is subtle and authentic. Overall a positive experience.",

Nothing is wrong with it, but they charge several dollars for each piece as opposed to roll. You can go to other places and have similar quality sushi at a fraction of cost. Unfortunately I can't recommend the rock shrimp tempura with creamy sauce. It looks better than the actual taste. It lacked flavor.   Drinks: There was an old fashioned here that was incredible! It wasn't the one I can't remember the full name, but it was like \"Applewood...\".  - It wasn't the  barrel aged kikori old fashion.  I typically don't drink old fashions but I definitely asked for another.  Lastly, I dont recommend the lychee martini.   Service - overall very good service. Waiters were respectful and prompt. However there was one waiter that was very weird and awkward. Maybe he had a bad night.",

Finding this to be extremely awkward we opted to sit at a nearly empty bar instead. The two bartenders that were working were vastly different. One (younger guy, I think his name was Rob) was upbeat and very nice. The other guy made us feel beyond unwelcomed and like we were more of a bother to him then anything.  We chose the chef platter. This came with 10 pieces of fish,  5 different types. It also came with a Himalayan salt block which was amazing! Everything was so fresh and amazing quality.

I had a moderately sized dinner,  $75 including tip, and, seriously,  I have had far better sushi in Little Tokyo for half the price.   The shoyu was unbelievably overpowering. The red snapper was not the highest quality,  served with no garnish or little brush of sauce, and almost tasteless. Unfortunate, as this is a favorite fish of mine.    The sweet shrimp was just passable, but whatever they fried the head in was not.  What passed for a tempura batter was heavy and salty.  When dipped into the extremely salty shoyu you got a saline bomb.   Their signature yellowtail and jalapeno was Ok, but certainly nothing you'd go out of your way to return for.  They do have an extensive sake and Japanese whisky menu,  and a couple of Japanese beers on draft.   So,  go for the beer and edamame. Skip the radically overpriced sushi. If you need to spend some serious coin, scrape together $600 and go to Masa..",

    "text": "I don't know why we came here, perhaps it's the prestige of Chef Nobu's name. The food is seriously over-priced and there are so many great Japanese places off the strip that charge a small fraction of the price here and the food tastes the same if not better.   We got a Groupon deal: 5 course dinner for 2 people for $99. The portions are tiny, to be expected at a fine dining establishment, so we ordered 4 other dishes to supplement our meal. The 5 courses had 3 shared entrees which included the miso cod and the jalapeno hamachi; both are signature dishes by Chef Nobu. The food was nicely presented, tasted good, high quality ingredients, but really lacking any wow factor. I really do prefer Raku on Spring Mountain better. The service was very attentive and nice throughout the meal and our waiter was super cute which is a huge plus.   It was a nice meal, but even with the Groupon deal, it costed $200+ for the 2 of us and I was still not full. Major $$$$!",

The tables have a plywood look/vibe and the chairs are so uncomfortable. Everything looked worn and tired. Our server was energetic and informative, but the service was beyond slow. We went a half hour between each course! No joke. Those kinds of delays when you are in an uncomfortable seating arrangement make everything so much worse. We won't be back to this Nobu location.",

    "text": "Nobu offers some of the best dishes! I've eaten at a few of their locations and when we landed in vegas it seemed like the perfect first late night meal.  This Nobu is enormous - their biggest location. We were a little late for our reservation but seated right away. Our waiter was very laid back and didn't get into explaining the dishes which disappointed me because it was my boyfriends first time there. He just went on to explain to order cold dishes before hot dishes. I started with a cucumber martini which was delicious. Very light and refreshing (the lichee martini is their staple but a very sweet drink) We went for the salmon and tuna tacos to start. The salmon tacos are a MUST! So savory and flavorful. The tuna was OK - a little too sweet. I love the hearts of palm salad. The wasabi dressing is just the right amount of spicy and its such a light starter. Next we went with the miso cod lettuce wraps which is an off-the-menu item. I prefer this dish over having the miso cod entree. The lettuce wraps were just as amazing as I remember. The lettuce is crisp and the miso cod is soft and packed with flavor. They're topped with rice noodle to give the perfect CRUNCH.  They were out of the creamy spice crab which was a let down but the waiter suggest a crab such roll. So decided to give that a try along with a rainbow roll. The crab sushi roll was awesome. It had some sort of crunchy component on the top and was served with a sweet dipping sauce. It did not replace my spicy creamy crab craving BUT was a delicious roll. Rainbow roll was nothing special to be honest - wouldn't order again. Nobu is definitely a restaurant where you need to KNOW how and what to order. I recommend going and ordering their signature dishes. I would give a more positive review if service was 5-star and they weren't out of  a dish we came for. Everything we enjoyed, besides the crab roll, was based on what I have already tried.",

After a pretty good dinning experience, we took Lyft/Uber back to our hotel, the Wynn. The restaurants drop-off for ride sharing is a far far walk, in hot and dingy spot. This shows poor understanding of your guests preferences and forcing upon us your personal preference: rude, expensive and dirty taxis.  So avoid until there is a better way if getting back to the strip.",

The portions are much bigger here.   We got the black cod saikyo miso, salmon spinach, otoro handroll, oyster shots, otoro, signature hamachi kama with jalapeno. And to kick it off, we ended it with a Nobu shaved ice. Our waiter also gave us a complimentary birthday brownie w/ a candle and he also compted the Nobu Shaved Ice. By far, the best dessert I had at any restaurant was the Nobu Shaved ice. Definitely recommend. It's a watermelon type of dessert with a hint of honey dew and with that, you get a cereal like topping you can add!   Nobu will always be my favorite upscale Asian fusion restaurant. It's a dress casual restaurant scene. Lighting is somewhat dim so if you do plan on taking pictures of your food, you might have to brighten it up for editing before posting it to social media.",

    "text": "We had a small work dinner at Nobu last night, and although the food was absolutely beautiful, the entire experience and service was terrible - so bad that I would never consider going back.    The Consumer Electronics Show is this week and restaurants get packed with all of the attendees, so I booked my reservation about 1 month in advance.  I got a call a couple of days ago reminding me of the reservation, stating that I needed to call to reconfirm, and letting me know that the table was booked for another party at 9 pm, so we would need to be sure we were prompt and left before 9.  I thought the message was a bit odd, but no big deal, so I called back and reconfirmed.  At that point, another person reminded me that they had the table booked for another party at 9 pm, so we'd need to BE SURE WE LEFT in time.  Um... OK.  Then, when we arrived 5 minutes ahead of our reservation time, the hostess reminded me AGAIN that we NEEDED TO LEAVE BEFORE 9 PM, before she even welcomed us.  At that point, I was getting annoyed, but we were excited for the great drinks, food and ambiance for the next 1 hour and 45 minutes before our prompt exit, of course, well ahead of 9 pm.    Our server arrived immediately, gave us water and began hard-selling us on having her and the chef select our meal.  I thought it might be a good idea since we weren't totally familiar with the menu, but I was a bit hesitant.  She kept pushing and we agreed to let them decide.  We asked about ordering cocktails and she said she'd be right back.    The next thing we knew, courses were being served, fast and furious.  We were literally 3 courses in without even getting to place a cocktail order, when I finally got mad and flagged down the nearest server  -- I told him that although I knew they were super anxious for us to leave, we'd like to relax and have a drink with our meal.  He apologized and took our orders, and then 10-15 minutes and a couple MORE courses later, we got our cocktails.  On top of that, someone who looked like a manager kept pacing up and down the aisles with a stressed look on her face about why people were enjoying their meals in a leisurely fashion.  The whole thing was just weird.  The food was really beautiful and wonderful, but for the amount of money you spend at Nobu, I want to be treated like it's a more special experience than the McDonald's drive-through.  Our main server was apologetic and I still gave her the same tip I would for great service, but in the end, I'm just incredibly disappointed by the experience.  There are countless amazing restaurants in Las Vegas, and I've never been treated so poorly in a fine-dining establishment.  I won't ever return.",

Excellent quality fish.  The much raved-about rock shrimp and black cod courses were pretty disappointing.  The shrimp was slathered in a mayonnaise-y sauce that probably should've been a side dipping sauce.  So creamy.  Too creamy.  Took all the finesse out of what could've been a delicated, beautiful shrimp dish.  However, if you love mayonnaise.  Then you'll like it.   The miso cod was good for a bite or two...but then was just too sweet.  Almost sweeter than the dessert that followed...which was pretty yummy.    So overall, it was OK.  If you want good quality and a full stomach for a decent price, I'd rather go to Wicked Spoon, Bachannal, or one of the other higher-end buffets.",

The most unaccomadating server I have ever experienced. I was truly shocked to be treated that way in fine dining. Disappointed that their management would be employing a waitress that would fit a Denny's or Ihop better. Somewhere you expect mediocre service. Usually upscale restaurants will make your experience perfect, or at least try. She made us feel unwelcome and that we were majorly inconveniencing her. She gave us attitude for not choosing a set menu, when our party was only 11 people. She seemed so irritated that she had to do her job and ask for all our orders individually instead of us saying yes we will take a $100 per person set menu with no idea what was going to be served, when a few in our party had allergies. I have been in the service industry for 15 years, I would never treat a table in such a lazy-I don't give a crap about you manner. She refused to spilt our bill. Which I have parties of 20 or more and keep all their checks straight. It's annoying, but it is your job! Take pride in your job and the amazing opportunity you have at such a great restaurant. All the other staff was very on point. The bussers, hostess, server assistance were all fantastic.",

With only a few fish restrictions and about an $75 per person limit, we let the chef whisk us away to a culinary destination, from which even my non sushi eating friends would want to return!

The ones I remember are:  Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno Black Cod With Miso (I'd sell my kidney for a lifetime supply) Rock Shrimp Tempura with Creamy Spice Sauce Kobe Beef Tenderloin with Okinawa Potatoes White Fish Usuzukuri Jidori Free Range Chicken  The service was really tremendous, with multiple people waiting on us hand and foot, clearing dishes, serving our next dishes promptly with almost very little wait time in between without making us feel rushed!  5 stars for food. 5 stars for ambiance. 5 stars for service.

We started with the yellowtail with jalapenos and cilantro. The jalapenos are an interesting departure from the wasabi we are so familiar with.  I only like a little bit of heat, but I actually wanted more than the thin slices offered.  We each had an order of sunomono (cucumber salad), which were quite large.We ordered the black cod as a hot dish. I would come back in order this again and again and again. We ordered the chef's choice for sushi for two... which was your usual assortment. The tamago was sweet and had the restaurant name seared into the top.    The food was very good, the ambience was nice, my Asahi was on tap, but you have to leave the restaurant and cross the casino to use the restroom, and the prices were quite high.  Yes. I will go again.",

Yellowtail with jalapenos tasty but a bit of a soy bite; sweet tuna on chips but not spicy as advertised; eggplant with miso was spot on - toasty, juicy, salty, silky, warm. Miso with crunchy green onions and silky tofu was great. Spicy soup with tons of fresh seafood and mushrooms.  Veggie tempura was good, but nothing too special outside of the wild mushroom - yumm!  Finished up with assorted mochi - mint chocolate, mango, cherry blossom, pistachio.  No wifi. Bathrooms outside restaurant - shared with Hard Rock Hotel, really?",

    "text": "We planned to have dinner with our friends who live in Vegas on one night of our two night stay there recently. After scouring the restaurant recommendations from my friend, we decided on Nobu. Sometimes I have to be in the mood for sushi, I don't always crave it like other people I know, so I was worrying about committing to a reservation. I was also worried about having to pay a million dollars (slight exageration; i don't even have a million dollars, and if i did, i would only spend half on wine) for any good wine. (True story, I made the mistake of ordering a glass of wine at the bar in the casino at the Flamingo (don't ask) one night and it had me wishing for Manischewitz.)  OK - Back to the matter at hand: Nobu has now made me crave sashimi, sushi and all Japanese food all the time. Not only did the server rattle off, in detail, and totally and completely from her memory, just about every item listed on the menu, BUT THE FOOD WAS AMAZING. I DIE. We had a smattering of everything from each \"category\" and honestly, went a bit overboard, but it was a meal well worth going over board on.   We dined on:  -edamame -miso soup -tempura fried rock shrimp with some type of delicious citrusy, creamy sauce -yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno (OUT OF THIS WORLD) -red snapper with dry miso (also, amazing) -salmon new style sashimi, which was lightly seared and served with green onion, absolutely delicious -soft shell crab roll -spicy tuna roll (cause, come on, you gotta round out the meal)  The dessert was good but unremarkable. I'm more about the main event.  Cap that with some amazing gin cocktail that I now forget the name of and two glasses of hellaciously expensive, but delicious, sauvignon blanc, and this is one of the top meals I have had in my little life thus far...   In short, take your gambling winnings to Nobu and order everything the server suggests.",

He came over and let us know that the chefs had put all food away. I am just confused on how it could have hurt to pull out food and accomodate a guest of 3. The manager proceeds to mention how they haven't had any guests in an hour so they packed up fast. I wad trying to figure out what did that have to do with the price of tea in China, and furthermore what that had to do with us. He made it seem as if that was our fault that they had made no money in the last hour. This is so sad, I am in Vegas all the time. I have eaten at every Nobu there is ... I.E. Nobu Malibu, Nobu Hollywood, this is ridiculous. Certainly not the way to treat paying customers. Patrick needs to ge taught a thing or two about customer service. How is he the manager. Wow Wow Wow...... I can't think of any reason he would cancel our reservation, and tell us we couldn't sit 6 mins past our reservation. The only thing I could think of is because we were BLACK .... So Sad in 2017",

They even made us some dishes that weren't on the menu that my friend requested from the Matsuhisa menu.    The service was also great - they explained all the dishes as they came out and kept our water glasses full.    The one thing I was NOT a fan of was the flavored fruity sakes.  They tasted like fruit roll ups or jam, and they were just not very pleasant.  I did however enjoy my peruvian caipirinha, and would recommend that.  Also enjoyed a couple sips of my friend's johnny blue, but when is that NOT the case?    Had mochi ice cream for dessert, and they had some awesome flavors you can't find elsewhere like red velvet.    It's weird that my first Nobu experience was in Vegas, given that I live in LA, but now I'm excited to check out the Nobus near home!  :)",

If you've never been, inform the wait staff and just them handle the ordering for you. You can give them a price point per person and any food that you don't eat then they'll make some great selections for you.  A lot of times I just stick to their sushi menu but thanks to the wait staff the last time I tried all kinds of stuff including the Wagyu beef and black cod which were amazing. I've had just about all of the Nobu style tacos which I highly recommend. To truly experience Nobu, order Omakase style which is about $150/person.",

Located in the notorious Hard Rock Hotel just off the Las Vegas Strip, Nobu is solid place, especially for those convention group dinners.  One part rock n' roll, with the dancers on poles in the lobby, and all the rock memorabilia, one part zen with wooden Japanese inspired interior, and one part subtle decadence with the most amazing Japanese meal that I've had in long time.    Here's what we ordered:   Hamachi with jalapeno and cilantro Washu Beef Lobster Salad with spicy lemon dressing Rock Shrimp Tempura - always a crowd pleaser  Black Cod with Miso wrapped in butter lettuce Fresh Lobster with shaved black truffle - show stopper ending Sake served in bamboo carafe and bamboo sake glasses  With all the Nobu's chains are popping up all over the world, and everyone saying, \"This is my favorite restaurant\" all the time, I dismissed Nobu for a while, but  after this meal, they are back on my radar.    Trendy, yet the food speaks for itself.  What a noteworthy and memorable meal.  I love that Nobu uses delicate sauces, that compliment the food, instead of masking it with salt and soy that most fusion restaurants tend to do.  Definitely an impressive meal for all our guests.  Great for groups!",

The blue fin toro tartare with ossetra caviar ( my favorite caviar ) was SO bomb that I admit, I ordered it twice in the same meal. At 50 bucks a serving it wasn't cheap but it was so worth it for the amount of ossetra and toro in the dish.   I also had two uni shooters, omg so good.  Monkfish pate with caviar--YUM!!! Would probably skip next time for more uni.  Nobu crispy rice with tuna ( at this point in the meal I secretly unbuttoned my pants, stealth mode).   And of course the rock shrimp with jalepeno sauce.  Next we ( I was eating with one other person so you can't blame me for being a glutton), had the japanese wagyu tataki, which I have been craving since a recent trip to Japan. Melt-in-your-mouth good.  We both had the chef's daily omakase, which was outstanding, and finished with a light deconstructed cheesecake thing that I couldn't eat.  && THEN  I didn't eat for a day.  SO GOOD, expensive, yes but you get what you pay for! No regrets.   I knocked off one star because service was terrible and I felt like I was at a strip club lol ( seated in the bar).",

There was like 6 dishes or so. The beef dish was super dry, tasted like bad flank steak. The sashimi dishes were good, but it was the sauces that did it. OMG the chocolate moose/cake with green tea was the worst dessert for a high end restaurant. The monkish pate with caviar was good and different. We were still hungry, therefore, ordered two rounds of uni and amaebi. Crap, it was like $10 a piece!~~ Oh the sake and soju, way over priced!!!  I think for 7 people, the bill was like $1500",

Also, there is no bathroom in the restaurant, you have to walk through the casino, through the nasty drunken guys who whistle and harrass you, just so you can go to the bathroom, it makes it hard to enjoy your cocktail during dinner when you know if you gotta go, you'd have to make a journey to find the restroom, and once you're there, there's a huge line full of drunk girls waiting to use the restroom as well. I would think for such a high scale restaurant, that there would at least be a bathroom inside.   Other than that.. the food's amazing, the bloodymary was delicious, the sangria was good too! The service is acceptable for the price you are paying for, and it's great because they expanded the place, so there is rarely a wait to be seated. p.s. the dessert is presented really pretty thaty you don't want to ruin it by eating it lol",

My favorite dish of the night was the Yellowtail Sashimi with jalapeno (I normally don't like raw fish, but this one was freaking awesome!), lobster salad (I normally don't eat fields of green salad, but this was an exception!), miso black cod (very yummy), the bento box dessert was great (esp the chocolate flourless cake which was very soft) and the mango caramel ice cream dessert. The ice cream was lighted flavored mango and there were caramel bits in there that was just great. Probably my favorite dessert that I've ever had.  Overall the food was fantastic.

The waiter was informative and always around.  We had the chief's sampling menu that cost us about $100 each.  There were 8 dishes total including dessert.  Each dish was very tasty and innovative.   We didn't order any alcohol only sparkling water.  Our bill came to $250.  Steep!!  Here is what I don't like: (1) Loud music.  I am starting to sound old. I couldn't hear my husband at all during the whole dinner.  (2) Close promixity of the tables.  I can hear other people's conversation. I need my space!",

The place was smaller than I expected but I found the ambiance very warm and the decor interesting.  I started with the tempura tuna which was like velvet in my mouth.  Smooth doesn't even begin to describe it.  Little did I know that I would forget all about that when I tasted the cod.  Everyone here raves about it - for good reason.  It is simply one of the most delicious dishes I have ever had.  My sister and took turns trying to con each other out of it...only a fish this delicious could spark chopstick violence between two loving siblings.  The creamy spicy crab was actually both creamy and spicy...and well spicy at that.  If you are used to things being under-spiced, then you would be pleased with this dish.  Tasty but not dangerous.  Not much else to add here - it is 10x better than can be described.  If you are in Vegas, check it out for sure.",

The food was good, very good, but not memorable and the presentation was just blah. Overall, nothing special or memorable about this experience.  I might still come back here again if I'm in town because the food was good. But I wouldn't recommend bringing your date here to impress her. Other restaurants on the strip might be a better idea. I would compare this restaurant to Chili's or TGIF quality...",

    "text": "Our first stop during our trip to Vegas this past week. We decided to come here to celebrate my Aunties Birthday! My cousin and I have heard so much about the place we HAD to try it with our mother's during our mother/daughter trip to Vegas.  Here is what we ordered  Yellowtail w/ jalapeno (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ?select=DwKr-LhPVr9kFIVr4Q7PtQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/TCWM...</a>: Very Delicious, my mother and cousin who do not eat sashimi even enjoyed the dish. After the dinner when I asked them what their favorite dish was this was on the top. It is slices of yellowtail sashimi w/ a type of ponzu sauce and good to eat with the small slice of jalapeno and cilantro. I think I've had similar dishes like this at other restaurants but I think b/c its from Nobu it just makes it that much better.   Sashimi Salad (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ?select=12QbNH80NCNJdBy_mZVnOg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/TCWM...</a>): The dressing on this salad was very good and tasty. It comes with mixed greens in the middle and like seared ahi layering the outside. I wish it had a couple of different types of Sashimi in the salad but that's okay, it still tasted good.   Scallops with filo on lettuce cups (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ?select=NK22wem6XYcmO21jvgPJVQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/TCWM...</a>): This was probably my favorite dish. The scallop melted in your mouth and the taste was pretty good. I think the scallops were made with a miso sauce and had green onions sprinkled on top. Whatever it was it was super super good. ahhh drool.  Whole deep fried cod or snapper I don't remember the name of the fish on top of sauteed veggies in a miso butter sauce (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TCWMgOiV0PxQkWE1SyBIWQ?select=vefN4PoI2zsBDZNyHZaAXQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/TCWM...</a>): This was another special. The waiter told us that everyone raves about this dish. It came out and we were all in awe. It was pretty big. The table was in WOW when my mother and my auntie started laughing... they then asked one of the waiters how much it was $100.00.. WOW, didn't realize that when we ordered it. I think it should have been something that the waiter said, especially since it cost so much.  Needless to say the fish was delicious! You can eat almost every single piece of it. The fins where crunchy and were very good dipped in the miso butter sauce. The sauce was sweet with a little spicy. The sauteed veggies were also very good and eaten with the fish heavenly. We picked at this dish the whole dinner and still weren't able to eat the whole thing.  Bummer b/c we definitely tried, we knew we had to get our moneys worth if we were going to spend $100 on one dish.   Sushi and the Tempura Dinner: Nothing spectacular about either of these dishes. I don't even remember what rolls we got except for the house roll which wasn't anything special. I would definitely skip both if you are coming here. Get these at some other restaurant.   The service was good but not spectacular. They have a lot of people working here but nobody went out of their way to enhance our experience.   Overall I would come here again. There are a couple other things I would like to try off their menu.",

To secure a reservation, I had to sign a contract, promise them my first born, and strictly enforce the men in our group to wear proper dining attire, lest we be turned away at the door in shame.  The decor and ambiance of the place definitely is True Vegas splendor, our service was friendly and on point.  Unfortunately the food just didn't do itself justice.    I will say one thing, the black miso cod was delicious.  The hamachi kama was soft and tender.  I have to give Nobu a hand for their hot dishes.  Unfortunately, when it comes to raw fish, it is hard to distinguish one great restaurant with another when both places buy quality fresh fish. (The only place that really blows everything else out of the water would be Tsujiki Market.)  I guess we were expecting a little more pow than just your average sushi restaurant here at Nobu.  The last thing that really sealed the deal was the spicy tuna roll.  Something just wasn't right about it and how hard is it to make spicy tuna?  Sadly, I wanted to be impressed, but instead I left disappointed.",

The panna cotta dessert was so light and refreshing, a perfect finish to our meal. The service was top notch as well.

My friend and I decided to do an all out dinner on July 4th weekend so I promised her an unforgettable meal at Nobu. I heard great things about this place and all was True.  We went for the Chef's special, around 8 courses in total, each one better than the one before. The waiter knew every dish by heart and can talk about a dish like its a piece of art (many of them looked like pieces of art)  Even the Green Tea was amazing.  Only twice have I ever had a Sushi meal that I will remember for the rest of my life. Once when I went to Japan and Nobu.   If you really want to empress a lady friend, or want to have a great start to a Las Vegas Night, you need to eat here when visiting Vegas.  Remember its not cheap, I dropped a few bills on this meal. But I Didn't care",

    "text": "This is the 2nd time I've been to Nobu Las Vegas, the first time was probably 8 years ago and I remember loving the food!  This time, I was underwhelmed and here are the reasons why:  1. New style sashimi isn't really new anymore, it's been around for a dang long time and to be honest, it's kinda played out.  S.B. and I both agreed that the plain sashimi was way better.  One suggestion would be to keep the sauces on the side rather than drowning the delicate fish... 2. Confusing menu - they had filet mignon in about 4 places on the menu, all with cryptic descriptions and different prices - once on the specials, twice on the hot items, and again on the last page.  I asked the waiter what was the difference between them all, and he wasn't able to articulate it.  We settled on the one with uni butter and peruvian potato salad ($50), it was char grilled and tender, but the cabernet sauce was way too sweet. 3. The format made me think of a deconstructed combo plate, where you pick and choose off of the different menus, but in the end you basically had a combo plate - complete with teriyaki chicken, salad, and tempura!  Don't get me wrong, the food was still very good, but the experience just didn't have the same wow factor.  I guess back in the day, this was kinda revolutionary for a Japanese restaurant.  It was high end, high quality, modern ambiance, and modern preparation, but 10 years later, after everyone and their mother has copied this format, it's just common.  Back to the drawing board Nobu!",

Will do it again anytime! i had some rolls and they were also outstanding.

Things I liked:  Rock Shrimp Tempura with creamy spicy sauce  Miso Cod  Fresh Yellowtail Sashimi with jalapeno   Things I didn't like:  The waitress was not very friendly. She informed us that our sushi dishes would come out last...guess what?  The sushi came out second...of course, we ate the sushi and our waitress came up to our table and asked if we wanted more food...she had no idea that we didn't even get our warm food. Please dont  tell us our meal must end  with cold sushi and then the food runners can not even get it right. When you are paying this much for dinner, you expect to get treated with some love.   The sushi rolls were extremely fishy too. My friends told me that it is the seaweed that they use...all I know is that I wanted to gag.   Also we asked for two orders of the Fresh Yellowtail Sashimi with jalapeno and they put both orders on one plate. That is fine but we received 11 pieces...so does that mean when you get one order you only get 5.5 pieces? The math does not add up. My friends told me that they noticed that they have been shorted before. Wow and my friends still like this place...Oh yeah expense account!!!  Small Dishes with Big Prices!!!   If you are on an expense account then I recommend...go for it...run up the bill and try everything. If you are paying for it out of your pocket, then I would save my money for my kids college fund!!!",

I'm not even comparing it to Sugarfish (highly recommended), but merely to local LA places like Brothers Sushi in Woodland HIlls.  When I'm paying Nobu prices, I expect better than Woodland Hills sushi, know what I mean?  The portion sizes were, frankly, skimpy.  I will credit them for serving a real Salmon Roll, whereas many sushi places use pieces of meat that has been broiled/burnt, this was real salmon skin, just like the good places do it.  The prices are really astronomical...and given that they all buy their fish from the same place(s), pretty ridiculous.  Hey, I've had sushi in Japan with businesses, and even paid for it one time -- a vertiginous buying experience that will affirm to you that Amex truly does have no credit limit on your card -- so I do know good and even great sushi.  This is not it.  The service was, and I'm not sure if this makes sense, but obsessively and (worse) aggressively obsequious.  This guy would continually hover over us explaining to us how (and exactly) whatever we wanted would be taken care of by him of the sushi chef.  Very intrusive, and I realize now it was the exact opposite of the very non-intrusive servile style found in sushi places world wide.",

And since I had Nobu while I was in Hong Kong(which by the way, was amazing like always) - I thought I'd skip the visit to Nobu in Las Vegas and save some money.   But my boyfriend was very sweet and surprised me with a RSVP to Nobu the night we arrived, so I dragged myself out of bed, dressed up and headed up Nobu.   I've been to Vegas twice before, many years ago, but never had the chance to try Nobu. It was about a $15 cab ride from Mandalay Bay to Hard Rock, and when we arrived - we found the restaurant well hidden in the back of the entrance. The ambiance was nice, but nothing compared to the decor in Nobu Tokyo or Hong Kong. Venue was small in comparison as well.   The food was great, check out pictures of the sushi/appetizers from that night.   If you are new to Nobu, here are a few recommendations from that night. Otoro Nigiri - $38 Sea Urchin - $15 Barracuda - $40 Monkfish Liver(Ankimo) - $30 Squid Pasta - $20  and pair them with the Nobu beer! By the way, Nobu beer costs $15 each in San Diego, but costs only $8 in Las Vegas - don't know why, maybe the higher demand for beer allows them to lower their price?  All and all, Nobu Las Vegas was great....but...  I wish I didn't have to say this, especially since I have such a bias for Nobu - but the staff did not treat us the way a $250 bill deserves. It was probably due to the fact that we were a young couple, and didn't look like we had hundred dollar bills in hand to \"rain\" on the waiters. But either they were blind, or the fact that I was carrying an exclusive limited edition Louis Vuitton bag from Japan meant nothing to them.   Waiter made no effort to create a conversation, rushed us from start to end, took five years to refill my hot green tea, yet five seconds to take the American Express off my boyfriend's hand. The waiter also talked to me as if I had never heard of Nobu in my entire life, he even questioned how I had known about the Nobu beer(since I ordered it without advertisement). At that moment I wanted to whip out the photo I took with Chef Nobu himself in Tokyo Nobu on my phone, but I thought, even if I did that, what does it proof besides the fact that I am dying for everyone to know that I met Chef Nobu, and that the waiter is an asshole?   Maybe I was being a little harsh, but I have certain expectations from a restaurant who plans to charge me $250 minimum for dinner. Since those expectations weren't met, I am ranting on Yelp.   If you want better service, try Nobu Tokyo or Hong Kong.",

Key Points: - The exotic fish sashimi and tartar were very very good, because they were usually combined with caviar. Fresh too... duh...  - Black cod. Signature!!! Yummy!!! Although to be honest, I think it could be a little too sweet for certain individuals.  - Yellow tail w/ jalapenos. Interesting testing. Def something new for me! - Kobe beef... whatever.  - Sushi. REALLY??? ok... don't ever go to Nobu for the sushi. It's not even real japanese rice or freshly made wasabi!!!!  - BEST BEST BEST warm chocolate lava green tea ice cream cake EVER!!!!  Btw, the bill was around $350. No complains whatsoever.  Conclusion: Must go before you die. Or before your taste buds die.",

The fish was well cut and well paired with seasonings and garnish.  My favorite was the yellowtail toro and the stone grilled wagyu.    Special mention should be given to the wagyu, which arrived raw with hot stones and salt on the side.  Dip the raw beef in salt, place on stone to cook for a second or two, and eat.  Simple but so mouth watering good.  This wagyu had desirable marbles of fat that melts, creating so much flavor that we had to fight for the last piece.",

I can imagine on a busy night someone seated right up to  our table where they would be practically sitting on our laps. Whoever said the waiters can be pushy was right. The waiter tried talking us into the 8 course meal. Again, I would feel bad for some young kid trying to impress a first date without asking\"how much would that cost?\" I did ( my ever heroic husband did not) the waiter said anywhere from $150-$200. I said forget it. We opted for the mini tacos, which were $10 each for apps!! That's $30 for an appetizer which usually cost $8 anywhere else. Then we got the sushi plate with like 4 different types of fish for$80! My god, it didn't even come with fresh ginger I had to ask a different waiter to bring it for me. We had 4 drinks (the lychee martinis delish) we had dessert and it was very good as well. Our total for the bill was $$360 including tip! I have no problem with a high priced bill but the decor, and ridiculously priced food is not worth it.",

    "text": "I have been to Nobu probably 5 times over the last 12 years,,, for business meetings and such,,,. Even though I don't like it, no choice - but at least i don't have to pay...  OK, maybe the first time was fine. I didn't know much about Japanese food back then. So, sashimi with jalapeno/sesame oil, fish with some sort of Chinese sauce, and edamame were just fine.   However, as I get to know more about Japanese food, this place seems to be just so-so,,, especially for me,, i have spent a lot of time visiting Japan lately and now I think I know what is good and what is bad. (All my Japanese friends say Nobu is FAKE and it is all about Hollywood celeb and media who tries to hype this place up. I heard it is out of Michelin rating in Tokyo this year. And Tokyo store is the best of all Nobu,,, so, you know what this means).  I mean, sashimi is ok. Sushi is not that special - sumeshi (sushi rice ball) isn't that good. Good sushi rice ball is a little sticky outside and super soft inside with mild, almost fruity vinegar flavor. Good sushi never fall apart when you pick it up with chopsticks. It requires experience and technique. Or maybe they use cheap rice from California.  But for sure, sushi chef here isn't there yet. Maybe they aren't trained in Japan. Fake.   Anyway, this place is waaaaaaay overrated and overpriced. I give their food probably 3.5 stars,,, but the price!! WAAAY TOOOOO EXPENSIVE!  Is it romantic? Maybe yes for those who talk loud and keep spitting rice out of your mouth. Not for me. This place is LOUD.  I guess people go there to show off. Have you talked to your friends how much $$$$ you spent at Nobu? Listen to your mind. I am sure you have.   This restaurant makes you feel you are celebrity - and this is pretty much it is all about.  If you like to eat good sushi - get a cab and go to Kabuto. If you like these rolls and wired sashimi, go to Sen of Japan to save a lot of money. If you like to eat sea bass with black bean sauce, go to Chinese restaurants.   This ain't year of 2000 - we have lots more to choose in LV today. Get real!",

The hotel couldn't get us checked in so we had to go in t-shirts and shorts but the hostess didn't give us any grief when we explained our predicament.  Pros: Food was very high quality and the service was very fast. That's about it.  Cons: There were no frills. It was almost boring. Decor was nice, but it was just kind of boring. Mostly because the service was TOO fast. That may sound strange but they were at the table every 2 minutes with another dish or to ask us to order more. It just seemed very rushed. We tried to take our time and talk but we were done with our dinner in under an hour. That was the pace they set. Which is great for turning tables but it wasn't the most pleasant experience. The cost of many of the dishes were insanely over-priced.  I would go here again (if someone else was paying, haha), but wouldn't make it a romantic evening. Food was pretty great.",

I recommend you do the same; you didn't come to Vegas to be boring and unadventurous, so why change now?\r \r The star of the menu is the Broiled Black Cod with Miso.  When you go, check with the waiter to see if this dish is available with the phyllo dough wrap; if it is, order it that way and prepare for the best thing to ever enter your mouth.  Also great are Fresh Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno, New Style Sashimi, and Sashimi Salad with Matsuhisa Dressing.  \r \r My rating is 1 star shy of a perfect score only because eating there burns a serious hole in my wallet (this ain't Todai after all); if only it were not as expensive, I could go more often to feast on the delicious food.",

Personally, four stars is a little high but I really enjoyed three dishes and didn't dislike anything so I'll give it four, albeit unenthusiastically. (I don't think I've ever typed a longer word than \"unenthusiastically\").  The black cod with miso was the highlight. The Kobe beef was amazing too but we all misread the menu and when that showed up at $192 I'd call it hands down the most overpriced thing I've ever eaten. The scallops topped with jalapeno were the third great dish. The sushi was fine though nothing spectacular.  The ambiance is surprisingly boring, especially for Vegas. It looks the way a Japanese restaurant might if designed by the high-school drama department - all cheap bamboo reeds and sloppy wood structures. And the service, though efficient, was humorless. Any waitress who can't understand the genius in asking if there are any beef-based desserts off the menu is not winning any points with me.  Still, the price minus the Kobe was totally reasonable, especially for Vegas. And the Matsuhisa martinis go a long way toward adding up to a pretty good meal.",

I'm sure everyone else has told you to get the jalapeno yellowtail sashimi and the miso cod.  We also really enjoyed the beef tenderloin, it was so tender it felt like sashimi, but with the deliciousness of steak.  We also got a couple tempura things that were very good.  I was also very impressed with the service.  We were at first confused because of the casual atmosphere and high prices, but I actually think this is great.  The service was still impeccable despite the casual tone, and it made us feel at ease, unlike many other restaurants with such high quality food.    I was very impressed that the small plates came out in a well thought-out order.  So often at a small plates restaurant your meal will feel harried because a bunch of things arrive at once or things arrive in an order that doesn't suit the meal.  Each item arrived at just the right moment and in just the right order.  Great great great restaurant, I would definitely recommend it.",

BUT, don't let me set your expectations too high. 3. Overall experience is  warm, satisfying and sorta exciting - hey, it's Nobu.  Why you should not go to Nobu LV: 1. If you're going to Nobu, you're either a foodie, looking for a trendy spot or from Japan and need your rice (like the table next to us). Well, while the food is pretty darn good, I heard the other spots - Honolulu, NYC etc have a hipper vibe. 2. You want to save money to eat during the rest of your trip. We gorged out and ended up spending at least $150 each.  3. You want to stick on the strip. While the Hard Rock isn't very far, it'd be cool if Nobu was in the midst of the chaos. On the other hand, maybe it's off-strip locale protects it...not sure on that one.  In any case, try it. You won't regret it. At least you can say you been to Nobu - like I basically am in this review.",

That night, my coworker/buddy Danny and I decided to splurge and try this \"NOBU\" place out... and it was AMAZING! DAMN!!!  Since then I have dined at NOBU almost every time I've been in town. In fact, I even had my 30th Birthday Dinner there last year!   Now, based on that experience, I wouldn't recommend NOBU for LARGE groups... it becomes too complicated and they pair down the menu for you so you can't please everyone and charge auto-gratuity, etc... let's just say it can be a hassle.  HOWEVER, for a date or a group of 4 or so people, it's great!   The decor is simple. The staff is MORE than ample. And I want to install that polished black river rock wall they have in my house! I digress...   While, I haven't had enough sushi here to comment, my MUST-ORDER menu is as follows: -Chilled Toro Tuna Tartare with Caviar: Too rich for one man! -Roasted Arctic Char with airfried spinach. Soo Tenda' -The Cod! Buttery, delicious, melts right in yo mouth! -Baked crab legs! Creamy, buttery. DO NOT TRY to eat this on your own!

    "text": "Before the concert started at the Hard Rock, I had enough time to sit down and have a fabulous dinner. At first I thought that steak might be a good idea, but I love Asian food and wanted a great experience. My boyfriend and I walked into Nobu, a Japanese restaurant. For our first time there, we decided to ask for assistance with the menu, and chose several things from each part.  Their menu is broken up by sushi, cold, hot and specialties. We decided to go with a little bit of everything.  Our favorite was the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno, and the crab tempura with their special sauce. Their tempura shrimp and vegetables were great also.  Overall, for the price of 266 dollars for two people to eat out of a tasting menu, it was a great experience. I can't say much about their food because I have to say that I've eaten better tempura at our local asian restaurant, Well Being in the Box.  Although their tempura was okay (it was too soft and not crispy at all), their sushi was as close to the Guam experience as we could get. It was sweet, done perfect, and the sauces were impeccable.  I honestly didn't feel that their tempura was worth the 200 dollar ticket. That was majority of our bill. I do believe that their signature bento box dessert was worth 14 dollars. It was creamy, a perfect souffle, and their green tea ice cream was just like home.  If you want something other than tempura for your experience at Nobu, it's worth the price tag and the trip. For myself, a good Japanese restaurant serves light, crispy, and fluffy tempura the way I've had it in Japan and on Guam from top Japanese chefs. However, this was not the case, unfortunately.  I give this restaurant my personal 3/5 stars.",

    "text": "Having heard many good things about this place, I was pretty excited to go here.  However, it just did not live up to my expectations.  The sushi was just so-so, I could have gotten it at any decent sushi place in the bay area.  Definitely not $100 meal kind of sushi.  Maybe it's because I didn't order the Omakase menu like most people who like this place, but I would think that when you're spending the kind of money you do at this place, even their regular dishes should be a cut above the rest, but they were not.  This is also the first place where I ever sent anything back.  The staff recommended a drink (some apple concoction) that turned out to be just terrible.  I'm not at all discriminating when it comes to alcoholic beverages (if it has alcohol and I can keep it down, fine by me!), but this drink was just so horrible that I couldn't take more than a couple of sips.  Another minus was the restaurant not having its own restrooms (had to go outside to the casino), which just sucked.  This place just did not seem worth the money at all, and I don't think I'll be back.",

    "text": "This is a difficult review for me to write - I have regarded Nobu Matsuhisa as one of the most innovative chefs in Japanese cuisine. Maybe time is passing by and his 'new style' doesn't seem so 'new' anymore?   I've had sushi at the London, Dallas, and NYC locations of Nobu in the past, as well as the excellent original Matsuhisa restaurant in LA. My visit to Nobu in Las Vegas did not seem to compare with the others. It was great sushi, to be sure - fresh, quality cuts of fish with well-prepared 'cooked' dishes. The service during my visit was pretty indifferent (we sat at the sushi bar) and the chef we sat in front of only seemed to be going through the paces of preparing food at a restaurant that would be packed with hipsters regardless of the quality or preparation of the food. Perhaps the global expansion of Nobu has dulled this place - haven't seen a change on a Nobu menu in years. Sad.  Anyway, enough hatin'. I had a great creamy spicy crab (excellent dish), lots of sushi - uni, konpachi, unagi, chyu-toro, kani - a portion of Nobu's house sake (love the bamboo flasks there), tempura, and the exellent miso-marinated black cod. It was all good. But I'm not sure I'll seek out the LV branch of Nobu in the future (it was located in our hotel in Vegas).   Given Nobu's prices with its growing 'chain' atmosphere and innovativeness of other places (Morimoto, Tyson Cole's Uchi), I can only give Nobu-LV 3 stars.",

    "text": "This was my first of many trips to Nobu restaurants. The hot and cold dishes are very good and innovative. I could pass on the sushi there as I find it to not be up to par for their prices. My favorite dish there is the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno. So simple yet so delicious. The miso cod is also delicious but everyone does that dish. Also try their Matsuhisa martini. It has ginger and cucumber infused vodka and is very refreshing.  I secretely made it my goal to eat at every Nobu worlwide. They need to stop opening new ones because I'm falling behind.",

    "text": "I was in Vegas this past weekend for a bachelorette party. And when we found out there was a Nobu here (see my NYC review since I had been to that one quite a few times), we had to come! I was in charge of the ordering since no one else from the party had been there. \r \r The decor is similar to New York's Nobu, but not as big and not as nice. The service is not as good but it's Vegas so oh well.\r \r We ordered:\r \r Peach Martini and Lychee martini - very good but strong.\r \r Yellowtail Sashimi with jalapeno and ponzu sauce - This was fucking good. One of my friend's doesn't eat sashimi and she loved this dish. (See below for Kristine N's review). They prepared it with about 20 pieces of sashimi on the plate for our big party! It was GREAT!\r \r Lobster salad - Of course I had to order this! I love the salad dressing. \r \r Miso black cod - The cool thing about Nobu is that because we had a group of 8, they actually cut the fish in chunks and put them individually on little lettuce wraps so it would be easier to eat. This was fantastic and sweet.\r \r Chilean Sea bass w/ mushrooms - The bride-to-be is a sea bass connoisseur and she said this was not Chilean sea bass, but just regular sea bass. It was still very good though. YUMMM.\r \r Squid pasta - I love the squid pasta here. Complimented w/ asparagus. I love asparagus!\r \r Rock shrimp tempura - we choose the butter sauce since the other sauces had been a bit spicy. Yummy.\r \r Bento box - flourless chocolate cake with ice cream. This was better than I remembered from NYC. It's not flourless as in a chocolate bar on a plate - it actually does have a cake - souffle texture to it. It was great, and gooey in the middle. \r \r Mango caramel ice-cream dessert - A light but tasty dessert with caramel bits in it.\r \r One of the girls and I are not big seafood fans, but we loved all the dishes here. (See below for Kristine N.'s review!) That tells ya something! Everyone thoroughly enjoyed this meal which made me happy because I hoped they would trust my judgement in food. =)\r \r It was nice because they brought out each dish one-by-one so you aren't stuffing your faces all at once. By the end of the dinner, we felt extremely satisfied but not so full we were going to explode.\r \r Yay, for Nobu!!!",

If you like sushi and unique infused vodka and shots, this is a wonderful place for respite while in Vegas.

If it weren't for the high-pitched cackling cohorts 5 tables away, I rather would have enjoyed the experience, but even those glass-shatteringly loud women aside, it gets a little noisy in here -- I had a hard time hearing the waitstaff describe each selection brought out to us.    I know this probably isn't the case, but from the looks of the floor that evening, the entire waitstaff was comprised of only smoky, built european men with bodies to accentuate black tight tees.  Interesting.    The decor is a play on nature, and I'm a big fan of the black stone encrusted wall.",

    "text": "If you can manage to get a reservation, DO NOT PASS THIS PLACE UP.  It is the best sushi that I've ever had outside of Japan.  In fact, they actually fly the fish in fresh from Japan every single day.    My menu recommendations -- ie get these three things or don't bother going at all -- are the Miso Eggplant, the Yellowtail with Jalapeno and Cilantro in Yuzu Sauce, and the Thinly Sliced White Fish in Ponzu Sauce.  Though I have extensive experience with the NOBU menu, in my opinion these three dishes are the most outstanding options on the menu.  Now when I go to NOBU, I gorge myself by ordering multiples of just these three dishes.  I also recommend their restaurant beer brand.  It's lighter and more crisp than most Japanese beer, and in fact, tastes more like a Chinese beer to me.",

    "text": "This is the second time I've been to Nobu in Vegas and once again I was pleasantly surprised. It started with our waiter, very friendly and helpful. He even asked what budget we had and offered to choose our entrees for us. I only had 2 must haves: The Halibut sashimi with jalapeno slivers on each slice.. yummers! I also love the tiny tacos (no idea what is in them but they are scrumptious). Everything else was great from the kabobs to sushi rolls.  Another thing I enjoy about this place is the list of beverages. We only had cocktails but they have several sake cocktails that are oh so tasty.  The menu can be overwhelming so I suggest you ask your server what he/she recommends so you get to taste the best of the best Nobu has to offer.  Atmosphere is very Vegas, dark and loud. Don't be surprised if you get hit on!!",

    "text": "I had never been to any of the Nobus but I was expecting a lot for from this restaurant - for these prices, I expect to have something, anything, jump out at me and slap me across the face.  Two of us went and tried the following: 1) Salmon Belly - $30. meh - had a wierd honey mustard sauce on them. 2) Uni tempura - $15-20 (i forget) - it was okay but nothing special. 3) Black cod Miso - $20ish - fine, but this is a cliche at japanese restaurants at this point.  They tried to offer it in \"lettuce wrap\" form which should have been a huge red flag. 4) Live Scallop - the best dish we tried - simple, spicy. i forget the price. 5) BIG MISTAKE - Kobe beef tacos. $42. Three tacos, half the size of our palm, and tasted like street meat.   It was difficult to avoid fried, saucy, overwrought dishes.  If I were to characterize this restaurant in one sentence it would be:  Japanese Cheesecake Factory.  We ordered a couple bottles of Sake which pushed up the final price, but we wound up spending about $180 per person for a very mediocre meal that left us still kind of hungry.   Atmosphere (in the Hard Rock Hotel) was also subpar - could have been any vegas restaurant and the service was not particularly good either.  If you're going to blow this kind of money, spend it at the Spearmint Rhino.",
