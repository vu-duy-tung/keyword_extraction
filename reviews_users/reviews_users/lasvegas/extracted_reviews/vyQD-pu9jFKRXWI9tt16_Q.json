I will for sure be returning in the future and telling my friends about  Shakespeare's.",

    "text": "Last night the hubby, daughter and I were looking for a new place to try and decided on Shakespeare's. I had heard good things about their so I convinced my husband to give it a try. We were hesitate due to it being a pub and we were worried they would frown upon our little one being in there. But when we walked in we were greeted with a friendly hello and were told we could sit anywhere we liked. The atmosphere was dark and quiet for a Saturday night but we liked that. And it was nice and cool in there which was a relief from the heat. Our waiter Jorge was great. He had a kids menu ready for our daughter and was very friendly to us. My husband ordered the fish and chips, I had the sampler platter, and the little one chicken pot pie. Everything was delicious. The fish had a nice crunch to it which I hear is important to fish and chips. My daughters pot pie was the perfect size for her. It had nice size chicken pieces in it plus it was loaded with veggies which she didn't mind. The sampler platter was just the right amount of bar food that I was looking for. We asked Jorge about their trivia night and he told us it gets pretty busy so to call ahead but that it's a really fun night. So I'm thinking that will be our next adventure to the pub. Thanks again for a great night. We will be back for sure.",

    "text": "Decided to check out Shakespeare's to shake things up for our weekly Pub Quiz night out.   The food was so-so. We tried one of each of the happy hour options - fish taco, slider and chips. Nothing outstanding, but solid efforts. The slider is tiny for the $2 price tag. Tasty, but small. The chips and fish taco were a much more substantial size. They also had some beer specials that were pretty cheap. The other menu items looked pretty good, albeit slightly expensive for pub food.   As for the Pub Quiz, we usually go to McMullan's every week, and before that Fado. This place pales in comparison to both. The quizmaster reads the questions out clearly, but the time between questions is insanely long. It took so long and our patience started wearing thin about halfway through.   All in all, the place was just all right, but we'll be back because we have to spend our $25 gift card we won for placing third. Haha.",

The two sort of weak points are the design and service.  Something about the layout causes smells to waft from the kitchen into the bar area, which is fine when it's food, not so much when it's cleaning solutions.    The other iffy is the service from male wait staff, the bartenders and female wait staff are fine.  They go a long time between visits, which is fine when you've got time, but annoying when it takes twenty minutes to place your food order if you made the mistake of knowing what you wanted to drink.  The general attitude from male wait staff is that they'd rather be elsewhere, although a couple are sufficiently knowledgeable about beer and not listed bottles to make up for the lackluster approach to the rest of their job.",

Service is really great as well. Casual and friendly.   Side note, and not really the fault of the establishment. I was eating there once when some strange woman who was eating with her friend next to us wondered over to our table and starting asking questions about our meals. We assured her it was good. At this time she took out her phone and started taking pictures of our plates. She finally noticed the WTF look on our faces. She then told us, in an official sounding tone usually reserved for fire marshals, that it's ok because she was a \"foodie\". Very odd.",

    "text": "I've been here once so far, but I am excited to try it again. Seems like a great strip mall find.  My friend arrived first, and after eating their wings and burger, called me with the insistent demand that I must come check this place out. He assured me that the wings were fantastic, especially for 6 wings being less than $6. However, as I didn't even see, let alone taste, the wings or burger, I can't really comment. But suffice it to say that my friend swears they were delicious.  After checking-in on Foursquare and getting a \"special offer\" for 20% off an appetizer, I decided to order their mac 'n' cheese. It arrived in what is typically a french onion soup bowl. All crispy cheese goodness on top and ooey, gooey, swimming in tons of cheese on the inside. I have no clue what cheeses were used (and the menu offers no description), but it was excellent. At first glance, it seemed like a small serving, but after digging in, it became clear that there was no way I was going to finish it - very filling. Based on the mac 'n' cheese (and my friend's insistence on the excellent wings), I will definitely be back to try out some other menu items.  And they have a better than average selection of beer. Bartenders were nice, if a little inattentive. Good space and set-up. All in all, it is winning so far over the other bars in my immediate area. Here's hoping the return visit holds up.",

As far as service goes, if you get the younger guy serving you, he doesn't get your order right and you will wait for your drinks.  ASK HIM TO WRITE DOWN YOUR ORDER, it's your experience, not his. He talks too much and forgets he is there to serve you and he may think your there to see him.  With the coupons they consistently send out, I will come back for the fish and chips.

The kitchen definitely failed on getting orders out on time and well cooked.  They might have been overwhelmed by the trivia night crowd, but the service was abysmally slow. It took well over 25 minutes to get an appetizer and 2 of the other things we ordered never even showed up (we were a table of 5, nothing crazy). The server was kind and never showed us any frustration, but she just couldn't get the job done.  The beer selection is massive so I suppose you could make a night of it with the entertainment- they do have a lot going on, just eat somewhere else first and order your drinks 2 at a time.",

Also the food wasn't very good.  Our lamb chops were over cooked and did not have much flavor, and the brown gravy for the mash potatoes was too salty.  In addition, it took a long time for us to get our food after the waiter took our order.  So obviously I will not be a repeat customer.  UPDATE: The owner or manager has recently informed me that this pub has over 200 beers.  It would have been nice if my server had told me that; all he did is hand me a beer menu with far fewer than 200 selections.  So I guess poor training/management of employees is another reason to avoid this place.",

This rating is 110% due to the food, as I would give the service a 4.5/5 stars. Unfortunately the food was probably the worst of my life (including fast food experiences), even in an intoxicated state where my standards are much lower :(   The Chicken Wings (6 wings for $10.99): My girlfriend ate the first couple, and half way into the 2nd one she asked me to smell it. Fortunately we both cook avidly and albeit this meal was a drunk one for me, I still expect fresh food to be cooked. The funky smell on this chicken (overpowering the habanero mango sauce) was an unmistakable sign that the chicken was bad when it was cooked. I (somewhat) understand using food that is on the verge of going bad but this chicken tasted as if it was well into the stages of rotting.   The Philly Fries: Under cooked fries with dry/tasteless steak that may or may not have been reheated. Atop this was nacho cheese that tasted heated in a can. This meal did not coherently work and the cheese was much too runny for fries or steak. Overall it was not very good.  The Jalapeno Poppers: Best part of the meal. Maybe slightly over cooked but not terrible. Two reasons I say this: 1, the jalapeno could fall right out of the breading, with the breading strongly intact. 2, the cream cheese in the middle stayed extremely hot (burn your mouth hot) well after the outside had entirely cooled, like 15 minutes after they have arrived at the table.   This post breaks my heart, as Shakespeare's used to be one of my favorite bars to frequent. Unfortunately I have not visited in a couple years and I don't believe I will be visiting again in the future :(",

Meanwhile, neglected to get our food order in before a larger party that was seated AFTER us! Food was subpar except for decent beer battered chicken fingers.  Was not a place to sit and enjoy a meal! Kids are allowed in this area that is bar and tables! Totally annoying and not a good place for adult interaction. We walked in there expecting much better than we got! Don't waste your time with this place.  There are so many better options in Vegas for gaming, a beer, and bar food!  We definitely won't be back...",

Waiter was friendly and got our drink order.  Instead of a McCallem neat as asked it came on the rocks but he was prompt in correcting the situation  My husband ordered the homemade pot pie and I ordered the Rueben with onion rings being told they were homemade too.    Food was delivered the chicken pot pie was an inch tall and looked a little soggy.  While it tasted ok my husband said it was more like a frittata minus the eggs.  When we asked the waiter how this could be a pot pie my husband explaining he was English he knows what a pot pie should be    The waiter said he saw the chef make it in the morning.  He did say the chef was Mexican so it was his interpretation of an English pot pie!   That gave us a good laugh.   The sandwich was good but the onion rings were out of a bag.",

    "text": "Taming of the brew.  This might become one of my regular haunts, mostly because the drinks are strong and I can crawl home. I decided  to stop here on a random Tuesday night before calling it a night and was greeted by the sounds of \"Pub Trivia Night\". \"Where was Britney Spears born?\",  \"ummm...the South?\" I thought as I bellied up to the bar.   I dig the decor in this place; old school lanterns, unique European chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, and a giant British Flag above the bar, so Londony! As I looked at the bar menu I noticed that they serve Poutine! The American werewolf in my belly growled as I ordered this insanely rich dish and a fresh adult beverage. If you're not familiar with this traditionally Canadian dish, Poutine is a decadent pile of french fries, cheese curds and gravy, be still my beating heart. No seriously, it could have stopped while I was consuming it. Shakespeare's Pub also has a bevy of beers on tap, but I went with the vodka & soda. I wasn't sure if I could handle a Stout beer along with gravy soaked cheese fries.   As I waited for my food and drink, I chatted it up with the bartenders and got the 4-1-1 on the trivia nights. Not is only does it get packed in here every Tuesday and Wednesday, but if your team wins you get to sit at what I'm calling the \"Champions' Table\". It's a table with a beer tap attached, serving of course, Guinness and Harp. I'm not sure if the winners get to choose the beers. As I pondered the idea of adding a toilet to a table that I would never have to leave, my Poutine arrived in all of it's gravy and cheese covered glory. Now a normal or \"classic\" Poutine would have regular cheese curds. However, in the Shakespeare's Pub version they are breaded and fried. AMAZING! I dived in fork first.   I consumed about half of this order along with some help from my girlfriend, after which my food coma took over. Love this place, love the people who work here, and love/hate the Poutine. To quote Shakespeare...  \"Unquiet meals make ill digestions\", True Dat!   I will definitely be coming back to Shakespeare's Grille and Pub.",

When I searched through yelp this place came up so we decided to give it another shot. Wow... hubby and I ordered 2 fish and chips and the plate was so huge we could have probably shared one (but probably won't). Hands down one of the best fish and chips in town, better than the fancy gastropubs around the strip, as well. The fish was fluffy and flakey and wasn't swimming in oil. We were very impressed. Our server Andre had a full station and was zipping around the restaurant gracefully, schmoozing with patrons, being all sommelier, host and bus person by himself and didn't seem like in the weeds at all. Will definitely come back, don't know if I'll try other things in the menu but this will be my go-to spot for fish and chips for sure.",

There's even a winner's circle table for the winners that has its very own beer tap in the middle!  We tried out the scotch egg (a favorite of ours) and also their Honey Sriracha wings which were very crunchy and delish. For beer, we shared the Rogue Brewery Lemon Chiffon Cruller and also each had a second beer (sorry not sorry) - I had a Hawaiian wheat and hubby had a Hefe - both were delicious.  I am not a girl who digs domestic beer - I can grab that at the grocery store if I really had a hankering - I love to treat beer like I do food and experience local flavors and small brewery tastes so this was a welcome find and treat!",

Their service is always friendly, their food is acceptable but not great (with a menu that varied it's hard to do half of it really spot on; so far, the best things we've tried have been the meat pies; they're pretty delicious, as well as the chips & curry), and they have a good draught & bottled beer selection with a lot of craft offerings. I'm not sure many people order the craft beers there, though, because it doesn't seem like their inventory turns over very often. We've gotten a couple of expired bottles, and a handful of draughts that tasted fairly stale and/or bottom-of-the-barrel-y.

The food is also very Irish/British based. The chicken tenders are my ultimate favorite.   Also, if you're looking for a hotspot that has something going on every night of the week, Shakespeare's has got you covered. Each day of the week there is a something going on. Thursday nights are ladies nights. Your very first drink is FREE! That's right FREE. Comedy night on Mondays is always great as well, I absolutely love Charlie!",

This is the same fish as the fish and chips, great crispy battered pieces.  The service can be a bit slow but the folks always seem friendly, even with nondrinkers in the party.

    "text": "The service here is absolutely awful. We came in for trivia about 4 or 5 times, and tonight was our last straw with this place. We've had two different waiters/waitresses, and they all have the same stupid attitude (\"Can we have menus please?\" \"maaaaybe\"). This wouldn't be so bad except every time they forget the menus!  The food itself is pretty decent for bar food, if you can convince your waiter to take your order - and assuming they remember the order. Every time we've been here, they've either gotten someone's order wrong (I realize this could be a mixup in the kitchen too, but still), or they just blatantly forget to bring something.   A few examples of what this establishment apparently considers \"service\": One of our servers was just blatantly rude - someone at our table ordered a drink (\"could I get a vodka cranberry please?\") and he responded with \"No\" and walked away. I get it, you're supposed to be the cool, laid back server that will joke with us - but that only works if you actually do your job. He never brought the drink, even after being reminded once. On a separate night, he brought out the wrong order (someone ordered chicken tenders, he brought chicken nachos). Instead of apologizing and taking the order back to be replaced, he put the nachos down in front of her, said \"I SWEAR I heard nachos\", and walked away. Our waitress tonight took 15 minutes to bring us menus (she was chatting - not busy with other customers). She tried pulling off the 'adorable girl' attitude on us, which again may have worked if she did her job. We never got drink menus, waiting another 10-15 minutes to order food, and even then the orders were messed up.  This is literally the only place I have ever gone and not left a tip. My entire group are good tippers, and even with poor service tip at least 15% (and that takes pretty poor service for us to leave that little). After leaving the bare minimum the last few times, tonight was the last straw - for the first time in our lives, we left $0 tip. That's how awful the service is here.  I like the food, I love the trivia, but I will never be coming back here. Spend your money somewhere where there's good service - or hell, even poor service is better than this place.",

    "text": "Similar batter for fish as your chicken tenders? Why, yes, please. I like that their batter is thinner than most places, comes out crisp, and keeps the chicken moist. My friend and I had came here after lounging around Crepe Shack for a few hours. Dessert before dinner had landed us right outside of the happy hour window. Come before 7pm on the weekdays and the appetizers are a couple dollars cheaper. The serving sizes are smaller, so the deals did not look that appealing. There are definitely better deals out there.   The whole Great Britain area does know how to produce good fried items. The chips are also delicious. Big wedges, sprinkled with parsley goes well with a splash of vinegar. Our pints of Guinness and a Snake Bite are reasonable at $6 each. Some of the drinks are on the crazy expensive price. Even the Irish bars on the Strip do not charge some of these prices.   For $26, we got two drinks, chicken fingers, and chips. Not bad since we could not finish off all of it. It is just a lot of heavy food.   I liked how honest the bartenders were. When we asked about the menu he rattled off about how some of the items are skimpy and which are the best. I appreciated the honesty.",

I finished a gig with my band one night around midnight on a Saturday, and thought \"oh great, I'm hungry again and there's no place that I like on my way home. I'll probably eat at Roberto's again.\" But a friend that lives in Henderson took us here and I was pleasantly surprised. Decent food - I had the steak sandwich, decent selection of beers. But even better was the atmosphere - karaoke night and everyone was having a good time. It's not my top choice in town or anything, but I challenge you to find a better bar on the east side that serves food after midnight and actually has more than 5 people hanging out on a weekend. It's really a 3 star joint, but in a 2 star neighborhood it gets the bonus star for standing out.",

    "text": "This charming little gastropub might be a bit out of the way for some (and you can't immediately see it by driving either down Eastern Ave or Coronado so do Mapquest it first) but it's worth the search- a pub that combines the best parts of both a British and Irish Pub experience, including a Wednesday pub quiz, pool/dart areas and a couch area with fireplace and flat-screen TV just above it for a rustic venue to watch your footie or the NFL on. In good weather, you can even sit outside but we've never been here when it's been cool (or non-windy) enough to do so.   The owner used to be the general manager of Fado Irish Pub on Eastern before it (sadly) closed and has brought much of the quality food preparation and wide beer and spirits selection along with him to this now British-predominant place. One of the best aspects in the bar area is one of those personal tap-tables with riser seats that allows you and 4-5 of your friends to pour your own Guinness or Harp while it keeps track of the pints drawn (and very accurately, too, down to the 100th decimal point!) Service has been good each time we've gone, too- not hovering but close by if you need something.   The food is definitely of good quality, the presentation is great and not that expensive for the portion size and quality. The fish and chips portion is large and very good, the Shepherd's Pie is well-made and presented, bangers and mash are traditionally served and the corned beef sandwich is not made from sliced, round corned beef logs like at some other places, but from a True, uneven brisket piece. And did I mention the traditional British breakfast with all the right sausages and baked beans? They also have great hamburgers and salads, ideal for those who want British/Irish alcohol but not the cuisine that goes along with it (their loss, in my opinion...we've never had a bad meal of traditional British food here.)    The ambience could be better, which is why it only gets four stars. Shakespeare's was not the first tenant of this space and they seem to have inherited a large portion of the old tables/chairs and room design, not all of which makes it look much like a British pub except for some posters and Guinness/Harp advertisements on the walls. But the casual tables-and-chairs set-up has its advantages if you have a group of friends who want to watch sports on any of their many TV's, for example, and the brickwork on some of the pillars gives it a bit of an Old World feel.  All in all, if you miss the old Fado (either on Eastern or when it was in Green Valley Ranch years ago), this is not a bad replacement. Even if there's more stress on Britain than Ireland now, they still serve an awesome pint of Harp to go with their steak and mushroom pie, and that's really all that matters.",

Or the chips and curry. However, my favorite overall is the chicken curry meat pie. OMG, the curry. I crave it daily. Sooooo good. Fish and chips are great as well. My husband really likes the sliders and the Caribbean chicken salad. During football games they have $15 buckets of sliders/wings/tenders with fries. My inner fat kid is always happy on game days.  Staff:  I love the staff. My drink glass never gets empty. I can come here, tell the bartender \"I like rum and fruity drinks\" and they can whip up something delicious and strong. YUM. The owner is often around, mingling with the rest of us and asking how things are going. He is a True beer aficionado. I have seen him sit with my husband for 15 minutes talking beer. He always asks for recommendations on what we would like to see on tap, and my husband likes to think that's why the 90 min Dogfish IPA is on tap (lol, his personal fav).  Gaming:  The machines here are gold pass poker machines. I enjoy them. Never struck it rich but I usually walk out even. They just got 2 brand new dart boards which is where we spend most of our time.  Entertainment:  They have quiz trivia, comedy nights, and live music events. I like coming here on Sundays and relaxing on their couches to watch the games. They also have a pool table and Golden Tee, neither of which I've used.  I'm here for the food, the strong drinks, and the service. Highly recommended.",

The beer selection is still good, however the food we had was poorly cook and over oily/greasy (second clue).  The waiter was \"pushing\" the fish and chips (which we couldn't find on the menu so it must have been something special for that night) Had the sampler platter, eeech.  I thought the chicken tenders were the fish they were cooking and mistakenly been put on our platter.  Nope, called the waiter over, we cut the strip open and, indeed, it was chicken.  HOWEVER, I asked him to smell it and tell me with a straight face that it didn't wreak of fish.  He agreed and said the cook must have cooked it in the same oil as the fish because oil is expensive (third clue). WHAT?  that's not my problem, who the heck cooks anything in oil that fish has been cooked in.  Anyway, the waiter said he would replace it and came back relatively quickly with a nice big juicy looking tender.  I cut it open and it was raw in the middle (final straw).  OK, we're done with this place, finished our beers and left for the last time.",

When I first arrived I sat down and waaited for service which did not come right away I then noticed in the restuarant section of the building there was a soccer team with parents ages about 10 which explained our server being a little tied up. She did come over with a menu and took my drink order which the bartender over heard and began pouring my beer. Once I was joined by my friends our server Debbie came over and could not be more pleasent. As she was tending to other customers and or drinks were running low the bartender noticed this came out from behind the bar to help, great touch.   The food was really good, one of us had eggs benedict, which I was told was fabulous, the other had shepards pie which he raved about. We split an order of nachos, really good layered perfectly. They had good beer speciaal and two for one bloody mary's, when the first one was finished the bartender noticed and brought over the second one, great service.   One side note that was mentioned to was that even with about 12 kids playing pool and such the noise was not distracting. We will defintly return again, perhaps we can make into a BRONCOS bar!!",

But she took care of it right away. They were also out of the whiskey (McAllen) and beer (Dogfish Head 90) that the guys ordered, which was disappointing for them. On the plus side, they've got darts and pool. Crabbie's, darts, and pool -- pretty much all I need in a neighborhood bar.",

The bartender with the half shaved head acted as if I was really putting her out when I asked her if we could sit anywhere...I waited patiently to ask her while she was having a conversation with a guy that lasted 5 minutes or so. We just stood there waiting for her to finish her story so she could acknowledge us...finally she looks at me and says what do no need? just the beginning...waiter shows up after 10 mins, hands us two menus and instantly asks if we know what we want. We give him our drink orders, and ask him to give us a couple minutes to look at the menu. He does, we order, food comes up pretty quickly...dude drops our food off, and never came back...I tried flagging him down with head nods, hand gestures, smoke signals, etc., and even had the opportunity to say excuse me sir once when he was at the table next to us taking an order, but he ignored us. He showed back up to drop off a check, at which point I was irritated, and asked if he had forgotten about us. He laughed and said no. I didn't laugh and said that I haven't seen you since you dropped our food off. It was delicious, but I needed a side of gravy, and refills about a half hour ago...to this he said nothing. Literally just stood there with a look. Finally, he says do you want a refill, to which I reply yes! I've been thirsty for 30 minutes. Honestly, I haven't decided if I'm going back or not.   So, I went back...this place totally redeemed itself! Super nice bartender who gave a shit, bomber ass fish and chips, and of course the poutine fries are to die for...all they were missing was a little nice, and by sweet baby Jesus, they found some! I'll be back, for sure!",

The Yelp Book Club timed our visit for HH, so being rudely informed that it didn't exist wasn't the best start to our visit. Our server came by twice in 45 minutes and drinks took 20 minutes to come out. We had to go to the bar to place an order- and we were the only table. With such aggressively unhelpful service, the food did not make up for our experience.  POUTINE: This spot goes the extra mile to bread and fry the cheese curds. So the dish is basically cheese fries with cheese sticks, with some underwhelming Guiness gravy. Fries were unseasoned, gravy was lackluster, dish went unfinished split among three people. SOUP OF THE DAY: $5 for their daily bowl, which was chicken curry. It was mostly rice and had no spice, as though this were Campbell's interpretation of a curry. Not thrilled. SCOTCH EGG: Sausage was eerily reminiscent of a breakfast sausage, but the mustard aioli on the plate kicked things up a level. This is sided with a heap of spring greens they call a salad, but nothing else. Odd. STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING: Spiced and sauced bundt cake, with a bit of whipped cream. This version does not come close to comparing to any others in town. Go elsewhere for your fix. Another unfinished dish for us.  Dismal food and shitty service make for a large empty bar in the middle of the weekend, despite large screens showing multiple sports games. I wouldn't recommend this spot and I won't be back. Crown & Anchor has friendly service, a similar menu, and better quality.",

This is an AWESOME little grill and pub.  The food is good, the drinks are strong, they have a ton of drink options (all reasonably priced, too), and the atmosphere is perfect.  I love pubs because you can enjoy an evening with friends without having to scream at each other to have a conversation.     Shakespeare's is great because it has something for everyone.  Inside, there's music/ karaoke, tables, and booths.  Outside, there's a great fenced off area.  While we were there, people were playing beer pong outside.  Everyone that worked there was very friendly.  They were really quick to fill our orders, and were great about clearing tables and asking if we wanted another round.  It was really busy because it was Halloween, but you still felt like you were getting premium service.  We will definitely be back!",

Looked like an entire family was being served and they had their hands full. So, given the place was nearly empty just after 5pm on the weekend I wondered what was going to happen next...  Service was fairly prompt as other patrons filtered in with some choosing general seating with others going to the bar. Had a wonderful fish & chips dinner. small crowd so service was, as expected, on par with expectations. Cod was very good and large...fries were tasty with generous helping and the Red Hen [something] craft was unique given the jalapeno bite at the end of each sip. Apparently it was brewed in Henderson(?)  Staff remained on top of things as well as being polite so good tip was the reward. Plenty of big screens...nice \"old world\" style decor with a mix of modern flair.  Parking was crowded as they share spots with many other establishments in a typical collage mixed strip mall set up.  Will be back to try a new dish (corned beef or other) for sure. Maybe we'll get to see if they can maintain service and food quality while juggling a larger crowd. I've read some of the 1 and 2 star ratings. Wow. With that in mind I'll update after a second visit.  Edit: Took home leftover cod and fries for part of next nights dinner - very yummy after removing from toaster oven.",

We were heading over to Green Valley Resort, and we stopped here at about 8pm on Saturday, August 20th.   It was just two of us, and we found a table right in front of a big screen that was playing NFL Preseason football.  The restaurant/bar itself was actually a great place, well laid out with lots to see and do.     Our server, which referred to himself as the beer connoisseur was very friendly, nice and helpful.  Kudos to him!  However, sorry to say, the food left a lot to be desired.  We ordered the English Nachos and the Sampler Basket and we shared both.  On the Sampler Basket, the chicken tenders and poppers were way overcooked -- in fact the poppers were actually blackened/burnt.  The wings and onion rings were pretty good.  The menu says it comes with three sauces; however, ours only came with Ranch.  The nachos were plentiful; however, the taste was pretty bland and nothing exciting.  Could I have mentioned something while I was seated and eating -- sure I could have.  However, I am not the type of person that likes complaining about my food while in a restaurant.     So, again, on the positive side, the portions were plentiful and our server was nice.  I would try this place again in the future (maybe in a couple of years) to see if the food has improved to my tastes.",

Not that each song is so expensive, but it's still MY money and it's a jerky thing to do.  Other than that - this place is pretty great.

    "text": "Went in the other night.  First off the server was great.  Kudos to him but....we had a coupon for two for one entree.  He cheerfully accepted.  I ordered Philly cheesesteak.  On the menu it says it comes with dipping sauce.  Au jus like a french dip. I ordered it because of this being offered. When it arrived it didn't have the sauce.  I asked the guy who brought my food (diff guy) and he brought me sauce in such a small cup that there is no way I could ever get the sandwich or any part of it in there. So the server brought me a bigger bowl (not more sauce btw). So now I have this huge bowl with almost no sauce.  About 7/8 the way through my sandwich I ran out of sauce and asked for more.  At that point he brought about a quart of it out...totally useless at this point because I was almost done.  On a separate note the meal came with a choice of side...in which I picked chicken noodle soup.  Now this was weird.  It was like they were at the bottom of the soup for the night....I got some broth with some spaghetti noodles on top and some diced chicken that had not even been in the soup yet.  The chicken was just sitting on top.  Strangest thing I've ever seen. Would've rather had the fries.  Chicken was terribly dry as well. On to my dining companion.  She ordered the burger.  He asked how she wanted it...she said med rare.  She cut it open in front on him and he agreed it wasn't anywhere near med rare...it was charred...so back to the kitchen.  The next one that came out wasn't close either.  She had one bite....ate the fries and called it good.  She went home hungry.  We also had to ask for napkins and flatware also....even after the food arrived.  They never noticed we didn't have any.  I ordered two drinks.  The server bought one of them for our inconvenience because he knew what happened but the burger was on the coupon so we were out $40 and the wife didn't eat.  Not a good night.  We live about 20 ft away and will not be back.  Too bad.  It sounds like this place has potential.",

Food can be a tiny bit pricier than comparable places, but I think it's worth coming here over somewhere else. Cool pub atmosphere with darts, billiard table, and TVs galore (ALWAYS have soccer on in addition to the more mainstream NFL, NBA, NHL and they'll put whatever you want on if they have the channel). Tons of beer on tap, delicious fish sandwich, big ol fat \"fries\" (potato wedges). They even do a Pub Quiz on Wednesday nights at 7:00pm!",

The few servers are overwhelmed a bit with the crowds for trivia, but they make the extra effort to get things taken care of. The trivia is a fair challenge, the questions are generally a bit dated, but there is a ok mix of topics. The 3 stars comes from the food and drink prices. Domestic drafts were $4 and most meals were over $12 and not more than basic bar food. Otherwise, this is a fun spot for Wednesday night.",

We decided to sit at the bar have dinner maybe play a little poker/blackjack.  We looked over the menu, which was a bit eclectic, but all sounded appetizing.  A local bar fly, seemed to have the Norm at Cheers thing going on, suggested we try the fish and chips--so we did and it was deliciously!  We also had a potato jalapeno soup quite tasty!  Mike was our waiter/bartender very nice and quite attentive.  Would definitely return..",

But what really sold me on it were the candied pecans.  mmmm so worth the carb cutting!  It was absolutley dead the night I went becuase it was a weekday night and we were just driving by looking in.  The staff were super friendly and great.  The star was lost in that we weren't really greeted when we walked in the door.  There was a reception desk and I waited near it to be seated but no one came to do so.  So naturally we just wandered in and sat closer to the bar where we'd be visible and from that point on they were very accomodating.  Great giant screens and totally an irish pub to check out for St. Patty's day if ur trying to avoid the strip!  They said they are taking over part of the parking lot and hiring a band and i'm sure the festivities will be full of merriment!",

I decided to look at a menu while I waited. The waitress was very concerned about what I wanted to order which made me very pleased with this experience. Usually, the waitress will walk away to give me a second and think. Not today my friends! She held my hand and told me everything was going to be ok! Also, she told me that my heart was made of gold. I was convinced I was going to marry this waitress!  I ended up ordering the Beer Battered Chicken Fingers w/ fries.   Let me tell you that at first I was worried.  $9 for some chicken fingers?  Is McDonalds open?!  I followed through to eat this amazing creation. Overall, the chicken fingers are definitely in their own category. I forgot to mention that I am a chicken finger ambassador!   The only thing I didn't like about the experience was the amount of ranch I received. I love ranch with my chicken fingers. That's just how I roll!",

The reason I take away one star is that their food is good but not great. Some of their dishes are certainly better than others, but some seem expensive for what they are and it isn't as if the quality is particularly outstanding. Of particular note to me is the sausage rolls which are delicious. However, I had a meat pie and some other things and they were all just average.  The place is really big - maybe too big for its own good when they aren't running an event, but it does really fill up when they have something going on.",

I will admit that their poutine is actually good. And this is coming from someone who hates gravy!  If you are here during karaoke, please stick around. People were singing very eclectic songs (from The Rolling Stones to the Beach Boys to Def Leppard) but they were all fantastic!",

It can get a bit crowded during the theme nights so be prepared to either sit on the comfy sofas or wait for a table. Just wish we would have showed up earlier for the trivia games. Next time we'll get there early!  They have a huge beer list with quite a few on tap. Looking for a good Irish whiskey or Scotch? This is the place to go.  I rarely buy bar t-shirts but had to get myself one from here. This place is wonderful!",

    "text": "This restaurant/poker bar/pub (nonsmoking!) recently changed ownership, and the menu and decor were updated. My favorite changes are the quality of the food and Match Play Mondays. Daily happy hour includes some excellent tacos (2 for $5, fish or chicken) that are really a great deal. I believe Match Play Mondays is a new offering too. They match anyone's deal you bring in up to $100. I've gone many times for this deal and I hope they keep it going!   The beer selection is most amazing- over 100 total between bottled & a rotating draft list. Brews include many local faves such as Joseph James Rye'd n Dirty, Big Dog's Dirty Dog IPA, Tenaya Creek Pilsner. There was an offering from Lovelady Brewing also when I was there recently. Other standouts I've had are Belching Beaver Peanut Butter Porter & local seasonals such as CraftHaus.   The bar area is actually quite nice and stays True to the British pub theme. There is plenty of seating in the dining area, and they have a Skee-Ball machine whose prizes include drinks, a burger and a T-Shirt. I think there's a dart board also. They have weekly theme nights, such as Brainstormer Trivia on Wednesdays and karaoke on Fridays.  A nice place for grabbing some cheap happy hour food and enjoying whatever type of beer you may desire!",

The food is typical bar food pumped up a bit. Offerings like poutine fries, and street tacos, and just about anything you could think of. The service is outstanding.

There were just a handful of \"English favorites\" and the rest of the menu was your typical pub food. All that being said everything down to the service was phenomenal! I had the Reuben which came piled HIGH with some of the best corned beef and delicious thick slices of rye. We also had fried pickles which were awesome. The fish and chips came with two GIANT pieces of cod and my wife's grilled cheese was also solid. Besides all of that the one thing I will make sure to note due to its importance is that the steak fries were cooked to perfection! Just slightly crispy on the outside and perfect in the middle. The only other thing I can complain about was that we got there later in the evening(9pm) and the music was really loud, luckily they had outdoor seating which was really nice so we could enjoy our last meal before we head back to Boise tomorrow morning. I would eat here again given the opportunity, and I think you should as well!",

After stumbling about for a bit, my husband and I settled in a booth next to the bar. A friendly waitress greeted us quickly to hand us a few menus and take our drink orders. With a request for a good IPA, she returned with no less than three tasters in hand. Impressive! Lunch was off to a great start (especially with Whitesnake playing on the jukebox!).      GRILLED CHEESE ($6.99): I went with wheat bread and steak fries as my side. A simple rendition of the classic but perfect for the price-point. 4/5  THE RACHEL ($11.99): Husband described the size of this turkey ruben sandwich as \"ridiculous\". He could only eat half. He went with sweet potato fries as his side. 4/5  The waitress at Shakespeare's was awesome and the grub was good. My only gripe was that there was a noticeable lack of vegetarian options on the menu. A veggie burger option would be amazing. A girl can dream, after all.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2016: #60",

Not only did she completely ignore me the entire night, she went on to rudely tell myself and my two friends that the bar was closed - when it wasn't and when she was off - that the bartender was \"taking sides\" when telling her there was nothing to fight about, and that I was trash. She is absolutely horrible and I don't know how she has a job in customer service. I would NOT recommend coming in if Brit is in. If you do, do not expect good service or even a civil human being.

I'm originally from Wisconsin... Midwest fish and chips country! Shakespeare's fish and chips are honestly the best I've had since I moved to Vegas 14 years ago.  While I'm not a fan of steak fries these were good and the coleslaw was good as well. I would definitely return for their fish and chips. Thin beer batter over large cod white fish.",

    "text": "I just moved to Henderson and searched for a local British Pub as soon as I could.. When I saw this one offered trivia and was called Shakespeare's  I was double excited. I had so high hopes...which were quickly squashed.. Where to begin... The service was terrible , I mean piss poor attitudes, pretentious snobbery , just plain rude.. How to servers, bartenders, and hostesses of a pub come to have such high regard for themselves and such low regard for their customers .One of the things a pub is known for is their love for their customers, that warm and fuzzy feeling that everyone knows your name..or at least wants to learn it. sigh, maybe i watch too much CHEERS   So where was I, our waiter was an ass. Our food was disgusting.. meat skewers that looked like mini meat skewers..So tiny and dried up ..They were completely inedible..I would have told our server to take them back, if he had ever came back to out table.. I was pretty sad and wanted to leave but then trivia began , it was hosted by some woman who just downloaded everything from a site and sat at a booth and ate while sloooowly going through the questions and answers..giving all the tables plenty of time to get the answers off their phones. She was too busy eating and flirting with all the managers to even check for cheaters.   Shakespeare would be rolling in his grave",

It was a tiny breast piece of chicken wrapped around the stick then totally dried out. So gross. The sauce was disgusting. We got the \"JoJo\" fries. Mediocre, cold when we got them. Our food took forever and was cold when we got it. The place was completely empty!   Worst part was I checked my bank statement yesterday and they waitress tacked on a $50 tip! She didn't even deserve the tip I gave her, let alone $50 for bringing out 4 beers and some crappy food.   I drove to the restaraunt to get it taken care of, and there \"was no manager there\". How do you not have a manager on duty?! I gave them my number and I was nicely called back 24 hours later and told that I was refunded the $50. No offer to discount my check or real apology. Just excuses! This place is a fraud and I will NEVER go back.   Disgusted!",

Unfortunately I was rude back. Point is if woman who just kept smoking would have put her cigarette out, then no problem. Us non smokers go there because it's SUPPOSED to be NON smoking. Jeff & Shannon are adorable & great Bartenders! I usually go there with group of non smoking friends & if they smoke they go outside. I'm totally wrong if smoking is aloud. I hadn't been there for while so maybe I didn't get memo. I apologized to the woman Bartender for asking the woman to put cigarette out & stated she was a Bitch for continuing to smoke like she was so entitled. She (Bartender) called me a fucking cunt loud. So I went to her stupid level & then left. I wasn't bothering anyone. I just wanted (to my knowledge) was non smoking place.",

It's a small area outside but there was no one there but my group so it worked out good for us.  The inside is a lot bigger than I thought it would be.  It's nice inside... not too dark and not stuffy.  There are video poker machines at the bar.  Good place to hang out.  And it's good for groups because they were able to do individual checks.  Menu wasn't super extensive but it included some nice options.  The service is OK.... I think it's cuz we sat outside that the servers were a bit less attentive.  Not sure. The gal got my order wrong but I'm not holding that totally against her ...  she probably didn't hear me correctly over everyone's talking.  The food... taste... preparation.... mediocre.  My eggs were a bit cold and dry.  But the potatoes were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The pancakes on the other hand were Very Good.... 3 big cakes... hot... fluffy... NICE!  And it was served with some really good looking, red and plump strawberries.  Bloody Mary was pretty good.  Better than Republic Kitchen's ... not as good as The Cafe at THEhotel.",

I have a thing for atmosphere, with a bunch of random good people whom are fans, eating good food, and watching great soccer...when that goal is scored for your team and throwing the high fives to your neighboring table it just makes the game that much better.   I wanted to switch it up from my regular Crown & Anchor routine and being near Eastern and Anthem area anyway it made sense to look at Yelp to direct me here. It was a smaller attention game Japan v Columbia so arriving half hour before the game left the couch and comfortable chairs in front of the drop down open and was the ideal place to enjoy the game. If its a higher profile game i would recommend getting there early for a spot as i can tell that this place could be popular with 2 drop down screens and projectors and plenty of space to roam during the game. My server was Shelly, what a sweetheart! Pretty much made my afternoon with her attitude and service. I had the Fish tacos, and my partner in crime for the day enjoyed the Fish & Chips...fish batter is on point and crispy, although i like thinner crispy fries rather than wedge the wedges were still very tasty. Pretty much ties the best meal i've had during a game with Twin Peaks where i also had fish tacos. We also shared a dessert, a warm brownie with ice cream on top that was pretty tasty and finished out my meal perfectly.   If your looking for a place to watch the game, and grab a good bite Shakespeare's delivers. Do check it out.   Tomorrow is Germany v USA, and i know where ill be.",

Taco shell was so rubbery it was hard to get a decent bite when the taco wasn't actually falling apart in your hands. Not sure what they put on it to make it so wet but when I finally got to the 2nd taco the shell itself busted when I picked it up so I opted to just eat the food inside the taco shell rather than the whole taco. Didn't have much flavor. I won't be going back again. A shame too since it's a local bar to my area.",

They offer and ton of beer (which I didnt drink) and a good amount of food offerings. It's a British pub (DUH!) so they have lots of british style food.  They have a dart board (I think it's free) and an outside area to smoke in.  The service was good, although the waiter stiffed me on a penny. I dont like that! It's my penny, and if I want to leave it for tip, I will. I really didn't care because he was a very good waiter, I'm just mentioning it because of my Duane Reade experience.  I didn't order food, but I tried the curry fries and they were pretty good. Everyone said the food was decent.  I'll definitely be back for another trivia night, it was great.

    "text": "Shakespeare's Grille & Pub was in my bookmarks for quite some time. Due to increasingly negative reviews it started to fall far down the priority list. Friday night, one of my best friends and I decided to do light bar hopping in Anthem and Shakespeare's was brought up. The space inside was quite large. I was expecting a dark and dingy dive bar, but it was actually decently lighted, clean, and very spacious. After chatting with the bartender, who was very friendly and accommodating, we found out that this place is now under new ownership. Then we got to chat with the new owner. He was extremely friendly and accommodating as well. He expressed great interest in customer feedback, yelp, and ways to appease his customers in general. He told us they are simplifying and redesigning the menu, and although we did not order any food, I am sure I will be back to sample some of the fare they have to offer.   The owner also has fun events planned for each day of the week such as trivia night, karaoke night, and even bringing in live bands. That sounds petty awesome for a little neighborhood bar!  They also have the TouchMusic jukebox of which I am the master with my little app. Another bonus! We had a slew of drinks for $20, so this is definitley not a \"strip\" priced bar which is a great thing. Give it a shot! I am thinking of organizing a UYE here sometime down the line.",

There were a pile of chips, though, which were good but not great.   4 stars for service   Sat in the bar and had great service. My beers slowed down when it got really busy, but my server was still very helpful with deciding on one of the 100+ beers. Even when it got busy, he was still fairly attentive.   5 stars for entertainment (on Saturday night)  A great band called Rev It Up started around 9. There was an uncalled for number of \"check check 1 2 3\" happening for more than 30 mins which was super annoying but once they started, I forgave them for it. They sang great classic rock tunes. Plus they're awesome with a saxophone, trumpet, and trombone along with keyboard, guitar,  and bass. Don't hear bands like that in just any pub.   This was my first time here and I really enjoyed myself. I was in town for work and this was a really enjoyable way to spend a Saturday night before an early flight home.",

It is actually a realllly nice bar and grille. I almost bought one of their t-shirts, maybe next time though. The bartender was really nice to us. He was always checking in and chit chattin away. I enjoyed his company.   I had the Shakespeare Sliders, and when it says comes with fries, its more like comes with amazing potato wedges! So delicious!!   They also have this neat table in the middle of the bar where you can have like a drinking party! It has a keg underneath and 2 or 3 taps on top to pour your own beer. It has a meter attached to it, so you pay as much as you drink. I have never actually seen that before. I thought it was neat, could just be me and my little knowledge of brewery shenanigans.  They are HUGE rugby fans too! So awesome! I think I am going to enjoy this little pub in the corner!   :)",

I can't say enough on how awesome this place is. There is no smoking which automatically rates it a 5 star, and Cory as well as Justin are great owners. They take time to hear suggestions for different booze and take care of their dart boards which I love. They were some crappy Coors Light boards but they upgraded to DMI Bandits which are staple free. I'm hoping they start some sort of dart league or tournament in the near future to take part in. They have the newest Golden Tee which is also a great addition. The next best thing would be a Power Putt LIVE machine, then I'd live at this bar!  Anyway, go check this place out but for the best bartender in town go see Shannon on Monday, Friday, Saturday or Sunday night! She may occasionally have others but it's a toss up.

The BF had Fish and Chips and it was pretty good, the big problem though was that the breading on the fish kept falling off- Dip one fish stick in the tarter sauce and all your crunchy breading is still in the sauce- That sucked... I had the Pesto Chicken Sandwich- Pretty good too, I loved that they had potato wedges for fries- YAY!!! I wish there were more food selections in the menu though... We do plan on going back and actually trying their English Selections.   FYI if your name is Ursula like mine - the bartender's name is Ursula also so you will be hearing your name all through your meal- whether it's her introducing herself to customers or people calling her- It never failed everytime I heard \"URSULA\" I looked up even though I knew it wasn't me-Maybe one night all of us URSULA'S should go there and really cause some confusing sh** huh?",

I was shocked at the size when I walked inside..it's much bigger than it looks from the outside.  It was very cute and cozy too.  We all got food and beers and the waitress/bartender gave us separate checks without us even asking for them.  She was very patient with us while we ordered all at different times since some people joined us late.  I thought the food was very good.  I got the fish tacos which came with a salad.  I was very surprised at how good the food was.  After we ate, we played pool for a few hours.  At a buck a game, it was cheap entertainment.  There was a band playing that was okay, but before they set up, the bartender had some blues going on the juke box that I really liked!   I will definitely be going back.  The food was great, the atmosphere was cozy and warm.  Oh and the best part:  NON Smoking! =)",

You can taste every fried food offering in the French fry grease. The poutine has fried cheese curds with a gravy that reminds me of a can of French onion soup -- I wouldn't be surprised if they found a way to fry that, too. The scotch egg I did not try as my wife sent it back faster than you can say \"Fear\"...the answer to this week's trivia question. I've had the fish and chips but put off by the upcharge for garlic fries even though you're supposed to get your choice of fries. I'm happy to pay an upcharge (I'm the one who always adds the guacamole at Chipotle) but at least be a bit more generous with the fries if that's the case.  The only server that is good is Laura and unfortunately she rotates location. The other male servers will either forget about your table and you have to flag them down or are ball busters trying to be funny but moreso rude and take away someone's plate of food without asking.  The beer selection is good and they rotate their choices weekly. Like I said, come here to drink, not eat. There are plenty of nearby restaurants to grab a bite before coming to trivia night. Watch out for obvious cheaters who blatantly score 10/10 each round despite really obscure questions...yeah you know who you are.",

Her attitude was awful, we felt like she was doing us a favor by even asking if we wanted something. Paid us no attention and honestly looked like she didn't even want to be here.

Inside we found the dining areas was pretty full, to the side there's pool tables and two dart boards and next to that is a jukebox And at least 6 TV's showing NCAAF, MLB and NHL.  We sat at the bar and ordered some beers and I ordered the meat pie and hubby ordered the wings.   I will say this ... if you want to start your night off early with food and drinks come here.. maybe things get crazier later ...but by 8:30 it was still quiet for a Friday night.

On the menu it is listed as Minced beef and veggies topped with homemade mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes tasted like instant mashed potatoes. The peas are canned peas. I've tasted a better Shepherds Pie as a prepackaged meal from the store. And that in itself is disappointing.",

The actual servers are awful in the evenings. I think somehow on the walls of the kitchen it says,  \"this would be a better place to work if no customers showed up.\" I feel like every time I order something I get attitude from the staff like I've just thrown their day off. Everyone who serves food is too good to work here. It's offensive that you would want them to bring you a drink or food. But then it's also offensive if you just order your drinks from the bar tender. In summary, come in with very low expectations, and don't get in any staff members way. If I could make one recommendation, somehow obtain Tanner's schedule and only come then.",

Even on a busy day like Super Bowl Sunday food came faster than expected, the order was correct, and the food was amazing.  Highly recommend.  Nice variety on the menu.

We got apps and salad, and both were very good. We came here, mostly because I love hanging out with my husband, but I prefer to be doing something while at a bar. This bar had several options. Darts, pool, and we even saw a large jenga set.   The reason this is probably going to be our new go-to local place, is that there is no smoking! Most bars get around that by walling off the food area from the smokey bar. Yuck. It was so refreshing to be at a place and not go home stinking (we've previously live in Chicago and NH so we are not used to smoking in bars anymore).   Also, the night we were there someone was celebrating something, and they had hired the karaoke dj to play. It was fun watching that, and anyone could go up there.   We'll definitely be back!",

Like, it almost felt like a senior center was loading up a bus and bringing it in. Seriously, I think they may have been telling them it was an AARP meeting. hahahah... It was weird! So I found another place to patronize for karaoke. At a later date, I went back to see if things had improved. As I like the location, it is smoke free, and the staff was always pretty good. But, Shakespeare's has apparently burnt ties with some of the better karaoke brands in town and at this point they use some horrible karaoke service by the name of 'Kool Katz'. (OMG!) In short it's like three middle aged men hosting karaoke: that have the social skills and social depth of teen boys. They run the karaoke queue by putting themselves and their friend through the queue faster. They obviously need the power trip of being in charge of something, so karaoke does it for them. Not to mention they aren't very skilled with the audio engineering portions of the job so it doesn't sound very good compared to many of the other karaoke brands in town. I won't be back for karaoke there until I am sure they find a better option.",

    "text": "I've been coming to Shakespeare's for the last several months solely for their Wednesday night live trivia contests; I live too far to frequent it otherwise. The wait staff have always been prompt and courteous, so no complaints there. My current issue, which I took up directly with the owner, is a format change in their contests, wherein they will no longer have a moderator reading a couple of the rounds' questions. It feels less participatory, and as a result, less fun, in a team context, to remove that element of interplay.  In defending his \"tweaking\" of the format, he seemed to be significantly overstating the frequency and repetition of questions that required clarification, and that, he claimed, was disturbing some of the bar-top poker machine players. Given that they probably draw upwards of 80-100 people every Wednesday for these contests, I think a few questions repeated over the PA for clarification are a small price to pay, when one considers the risk of losing the many players who like the new format less or not-at-all.",

We anxiously ordered the F&C's.  It looked good on the plate, large portions however they were both soaked in bad tasting grease as were the chips.  I was so disappointed as I had not eaten anything all day and was starved by the time I got there. But even with my iron stomach grumbling I couldn't eat it. And believe me, I can eat anything.  I know a few things about the restaurant business and cooking. First off I could tell the fry oil had not been changed in a while and they too may have been cooked at a a too low temperature which allows the fat to soak in the batter.  Also they were totally tasteless. I mean TOTALLY. I had to drench them in vinegar and leaned heavy on the tarter sauce to try to mask the bad oily flavor but they were just too permeated with grease to eat.  I politely told the waitress that they should change the fry oil and she told me they just did.  Believe me they did not.  Also I realize I was using a two for one coupon but she still should have offered to make it a better experience somehow. She did not. Also we asked to play a round of darts while waiting and all of the darts given to us were pretty much all broken.  Not good for a place that like to brag about being a traditional Brittish pub.When I got home we were sick to the stomach from the few bites we did eat. I'm considering calling them up today and asking for a refund minus the tip. I really don't want to go back for a \"make up meal\".  I'm hoping the owner reads this and realizes I don't mean to bash them, just draw attention to some major shortcomings. I hope he fixes them as I'd like nothing more than this local business to thrive.. Despite the 2 for 1, the bill still came to about $30 including tip (which I always base on the amount before any discount.)  I really hope they step up their game.",

The menu has been upgraded, the food has exceeded my expectations, and that girl pours some AMAZING cocktails! Make sure you check out the new Shakespeare's and ask for Lucia- you won't be disappointed!",

The place was packed, but we somehow found 2 open seats and were able to chill, eat some fish and chips, and enjoy live music from Darby O Gill and the Little People.  The fish and chips were absolutely delicious.  Some of the best I've had in town!  Most recently, we've been going on Friday nights for karaoke.  Shanne Kool Katz is the normal host, and he's great.  We've been to some of his other shows, so we were pretty happy to know that he hosts here too.    Over the last 3 weeks, we've tried the following food items: buffalo wings:  Really well prepared.  Spicy and delicious.   chicken fingers:  excellent.  Not greasy at all, and only $5 during happy hour.  Lamp chops:  Its hard to find places that do lamb correctly, and Shakespeare's is one of them.  They were a little on the small side, but they are so full of flavor, it didn't matter that much to us.    Staff is great as well.  Tanner at the bar is the sweetest.  He's always taking good care of his patrons.    All in all, I'm glad we've started coming back to Shakespeare's.  We'll be back again this Friday night for karaoke with Shanne!",

Everyone got fish and chips except myself since I don't like fried fish So fried fish and a meat pie. I am a fan of English meat pies, maybe i just made assumptions here This was more of a chicken pot pie but with meat and no veggies. The puff pastry was good and the filling was good. We actually dined with the people recommending this and they seemed to enjoy their fish, my family on the other hand found the fish really oily. The chips are great though. And they let me sample a cucumber beer they had on the list. The philly steak fries were totally awesome and could easily be a meal.  Without the fish there would be another star in it.  Atmosphere is great and the waitress was very friendly and helpful.",

The bartenders were super chill and helpful as to finding other places to try in the area. We sat at the bar and played the machines, not a crazy amount of games to choose from, but it did the job. They also serve food and the menu was pretty extensive. I also thought it was neat that if you get a club card (\"Shakespeare's card\") they give you $10 of free credits. They have a nice size patio and trivia, darts, TouchTunes, and live music sometimes.  My only problem with this bar is the pool table. It's pretty awful. Seeing as how that is the attraction we went for, it was a little disappointing. The felt was so loose you could pinch it, and there were multiple rips. Don't get me started on the sticks! But it's machine operated so you can play for 30 minutes for $5. I will be back, but not for the table!",

    "text": "I've been into trying beers as of late, but as much as I want to support places like this, I wasn't happy enough with the food.  Shakespeare's Grille & Pub is an English-styled bar just over the Henderson border of Eastern Ave. They're a sports bar - specifically a Steelers bar, if you're into that kind of thing - and were airing NFL games on the big projector and several smaller TVs on the penultimate Sunday of the playoffs. And if you're into craft beers, they have a handful available both on draft and on tap. Perhaps try a particular popular third-party beer-centric app and you could see that they regularly update their menu online in a timely manner.  I had a late \"lunch\" here with Michael K. He suggested that the Guinness draft ($5) was a good option here. so I started with one pint. It's about the same as I faintly recalled from the other time I'd had this (funny enough, also on an afternoon with Michael). The beer isn't too bitter, but the creamy. even silky texture is what would convince me to try it again.  I opted for something different for pint #2, an Oskar Blues Brewery draft called Hotbox Coffee Porter ($7). It's about as dark as the Guinness, but the ubiquitous coffee flavor of porters is in full effect with this craft beer. It's about as good as I've had in a \"basic\" porter.  Happy hour specials are available daily from 3 to 6 pm and from midnight to 2 am. We happened to visit during happy hour, so we ordered a plethora of $5 food options:  - Potato Skins: not very crispy or seasoned, perhaps relying on the bacon for flavor a bit too much - Sausage rolls: underwhelming, with the \"bangers\" tasting like simple (allbeit satisfying) bratwurst and the pastry shell ending up more greasy than flaky. However, the horseradish mustard aioli was addictive and found its way into other dishes. - Chips, Salsa & Whiz: simple, crunchy, prefab tortilla chips with a mild chipotle salsa and some liquid cheese product. Tasty, but the culinary effort is minimal.  Also, I had to check out the Poutine Fries ($8.99), which were perhaps a more competent take on the dish than some other local efforts. I still missed having crispiness on the steak fries, but the gravy and cheddar were plentiful, and the breaded/fried cheese curds were satisfying. I do wish that the cheese curbs were sized and dispersed more evenly, but I could see myself ordering this again barring a better local alternative (interestingly, Michael has already provided such a recommendation).  The game volume wasn't so loud that I couldn't have a conversation. The lighting was lackluster at most seats aside from the cozy booth which we'd located not far from the bar. Other patrons only got loud once or twice during the course of the football action.  I just don't see myself coming back to Shakespeare's for the food, and the beer variety is better than some places but not up to snuff with the real craft beer hotspots around town (and also pricier). It's a very solid neighborhood watering hole, but it's not a destination.",

We came here to watch the World Cup semi final and they do have plenty of screens (although the projectors are not as bright/sharp as would be ideal).  The food just wasn't very good/authentic at all.  The bacon in the \"Full English Breakfast\" is american style (I didn't order it, but was disappointed to hear that).  I had the sausage rolls which were very \"heavy/stodgy\" the meat had next to no flavor and perhaps the pastry just wasn't cooked long enough?  The poutine had some breaded cheese curds which did not help the flavor/texture (as the gravy just made them very soggy).  The shepherds pie was decent - the smaller lunchtime size was big enough for me.  They do have HP sauce and malt vinegar on all the tables which is a nice touch.  My wife had the fish & chips (which really is fish and wedge fries - and seasoned wedge fries which is just odd).  The whole meal kind of looked like it was from Sysco.  I would not head back here - and also would not say that their food is representative of good English pub fayre.",

There is a day shift bar tender that's really cool in fact, I lost $300 once and she bought me breakfast which made me feel good and I came back. The first time was a night bartender and he was awesome as well. Tonight however, two bartenders were here and one worse than the other. Never once came over and asked me if I wanted a drink until I called one over. I asked for a beer and she rudely said while rolling her eyes \"ya what kind\" as if totally impatient. Most bar tenders smile and greet you, especially if you've never met them. I had a few $100 bills on the table to play and one would think that commands at least a greet or some sort of professional hello. When my food came (great food btw) I had fries and she didn't even offer me ketchup or a napkin and certainly never another beer. It was a horrible experience and all they did was gossip in the corner together. I will never come here on a Friday night again. They are a poor reflection of your business.",

Great music, great food, impressive craft beer selection, outdoor seating avail, pool tables, darts, and trivia, and tons of tvs everywhere to keep you entertained. This is a pretty big place and perfect for larger groups. Our server Jorge (sp?) was on it! By the end of the evening our friendly, fun and attentive server felt like a part of our group. The bartenders were also super nice. Shakespears was a refreshing departure from some of the more popular bars here in Henderson that constantly fall short in terms of service. Love it and will definitely return",

I observed that they were short staffed, Jorge our server/waiter/busser/pre-cook and who knows what else? Had made a huge difference. He was on it! There was another big group including ours and he managed to take care of all of us. Kudos to Jorge! i had stumbled my way back into the kitchen when i noticed him prepping food, of course i had to make things more difficult by ordering something that wasn't on the menu. He kindly obliged. Whoa! this guy has heart.  What made this pub nice was the patrons, the patrons made everything come alive. good food, good drink, good people and that hilarious card game. Passer byes stopped to ask what group we were in and what the heck we were doing. I guess we get a little silly and we do laugh a lot, literally \"laughing out loud\". i do apologize if i had offended anyone, i do get a little out of hand, i'm really not that guy. Anyhow, we had a good time and i even got a Shakespeare's T-shirt (i like collecting stuff). Upon leaving i shook Jorge's hand and thanked him for his service, i left him a generous tip.  My suggestion, though it's not the greatest pub, it is a pub and if you want a good experience bring lots of people and that funny card game. I'm still laughing at the answers. (oh yeah, the juke box was annoying)  Cheers!",

If I lived in the area I would definitely drop by for some of the premier league soccer games.  The premier league banners on the wall give the bar an atmosphere that is different from the standard cookie cutter sports bar.  Drinks are reasonably priced and mixed drinks are well made.  I've never had a beer there, but the selection looks pretty diverse and would appeal to beer aficionados.  The food is largely pub classics.  The battered chicken tenders are good and rate up there with some of the better chicken tenders in the Las Vegas bars.  The sausage rolls with aioli mustards are an excellent appetizer to share and were good as well.  There is not an item on the food menu that you would think of and say I have to go to this bar.  In fairness, that statement is True for 99% of the bar food in Las Vegas.  What really makes this place four stars is the service and friendly owners.  the staff goes out of their way to make your bar experience a quality one.  Somewhere John Taffer would be very happy.",

They took me here tonight and the waiter Jorge was ridiculously terrible. This review will not be good and because of him I will probably never go back there again, my cousin even said she might stop going there because they had him the last three times and it was just the worst service ever. They ordered their beers and I let the waiter know that I needed a couple of more minutes because they have a really big beer list. He came back roughly 5 minutes later with their beer and as I was midsentence about to order my beer, he stormed off and walked away not even asking if I was ready. He Didn't come back to the table until roughly 5 to 7 minutes later. I ordered my beer and he was out of it so I ordered a different beer that he said he had. He came back to the table with a totally different beer that I didn't ask for. He said he was out of that beer that I asked for as well. What he should've done was come back to the table and ask me what I wanted instead of assuming what he thought I wanted. I ordered my next beer and he came back to the table with the original beer I asked for that he said he was out of in the first place. At this point I was fuming and there was nothing that was going to turn the service around. At the end of the night we asked for our check at three different occasions and still nothing. Oh and did I mention that he handed us everything we ordered instead of putting it down on the table!? Worst service ever and they were out of a lot of stuff!!! Terrible. I forgot to mention his snarky comments that he thought was funny but was actually just rude.",

The food is good hearty and full of flavor, it maybe not be as authentic as most pubs by way of atmosphere, but they deliver on quality of food and service, The chips are excellent the beer cold and yes the Guiness on tap is like an \"old friend\" in a glass. Try it if you crave pub comfort food or just want to chill in a friendly neighborhood place, for some beer and pool.",

The waitress was on top of it and was always quick to refill our drinks.  They have a lot of English/Irish beers on tap and even a few craft beers like Lagunitas and Stone.

The bad news was they did not have Harp or Bass on tap which is weird for a pub to not at least have one of those so you can do a Black and Tan or Half and Half. The drinks were a bit pricey for a local pub but it seems like everywhere now has upped the alcohol prices. All in all a very nice local place with a good vibe.",

The fish and chips was once really 'the best in town', now it looks and tastes like the frozen Gorden's fisherman's fish from the grocery store.  Unbelievably the Guinness didn't even taste right!

The fish itself was crunchy and not soggy. The potato wedges and coleslaw was delicious as well. The service was great, she was very pleasant and had a great personality.

For food, we started with the Chicken Curry meat pie. I liked lt, and want to go back and try the steak one. Then we split the chicken Tikka Masala and the Sheperd's Pie. Both were pretty good. I love a good Sheperd's pie, but I was kinda stuffed by the time I got to it. The Chicken Tikka Masala was unlike any I've had before but good. I definitely want to try their fish and chips too.

At a joint like this I did not expect the beer list to be so extensive and I was pleasantly surprised. I have come here a couple of times for lunch and a few times I have come to partake in the Trivia Pub Quiz UYEs.  The food itself is what you would expect from a pub. Good not great, and sometimes you will have to wait a little while for it to come out of the kitchen. I found it quite interesting that their chicken tenders resembled the fish portion of an order of fish n chips, in that the batter used for the protein was identical. The saving grace for me was finding Poutine on the menu, which is a childhood favorite of mine. Can't go wrong with french fries slathered in hot gravy and topped with onions and cheese curds.

    "text": "Gotta update my review to a 4.  I come here often if I'm looking to watch sports or grab a beer and am in the Henderson area.  There really is nowhere better for a pub atmosphere and rotating craft beer selection.  And their prices have actually gone down, where most beers on the menu cap out at $6, even for a usually more expensive double IPA or Belgian (used to be $7 or $8).  And I have failed to find a game that they could not put on the TV.  Nice staff, albeit sometimes tough to flag down for a refill, but they will change the channel for you and are helpful all around.  Great neighborhood bar; I wish they opened up another location in Summerlin.",

    "text": "My Friend and I were coming back from a tennis match on the Henderson side of town and we saw Shakespeares's Grille and decided to try it.  We were greeted immediately right when we walked in the door by the GM Joey he was super friendly and made some suggestions on what to order for lunch,  My friend had the recommended Ruben and I had the Chicken Teriakai bowl  We decided to sit at the bar and play some video poker while we waited for our food to come. Our bartender was very friendly and welcoming and our food came very quickly and it was fantastic!  My friend is pretty picky and she said that was the best Rueben she's had in a very long time,  Wasn't fatty and the sauerkraut was very tasty that came with it.  Even her fries were great that I had to try.. My Chicken Teriyaki bowl was exactly what I wanted, I got the Teriakai sauce on the side so I could control how much I wanted to put on.  While we were eating I got 4 of kind and got to spin for an extra bonus of 25.00.  Cashed out and got on our way home but had a great experience at Shakespeare's...Would highly recommended it and I will definitely be back especially to try the fish & chips! Side note ~ There is no smoking inside and that was a plus for us not to smell smoke when we walked in..",

Lots of great beer on tap and in bottles. Not just a place to get a cold domestic lager -- although you certainly can.   I've ate here a couple of times. Good bad food, but some of the specials are pretty bland. I got brisket once and that was a mistake. The old lady's mac and cheese was very good.   Will have to hit one of the beer events. Thinking that will take my opinion up a notch.",

There's plenty of parking and when we were there for a late lunch there was plenty of seating. Plus a real bonus is that it's all non-smoking except on the patio.   Had super friendly service from Shelly.  She did a great job suggesting a brew (Victory at Sea Coconut - Ballast Point Brewing), it was a super good Porter with just the right amount of chocolate, vanilla and coffee flavoring with a strong but very tasty coconut flavor. Unusual, but easy, pleasant and very good.  For food we had the Poutine, Fish & Chips and a Burger. Everything was very good and very favorable.   Again, a place that's easy to like and enjoy. Overall, a great experience.",

Fish was cooked to perfection, crispy outside with tender, flaky fish inside. Chips are more like fries, but they serve their purpose. The Guinness is really smooth and at the right temperature to remind you that this is a UK based entree.   This business has many theme nights like trivia and sports based, so depending when you go it can get busy or louder than usual, so when I go for dinner I like to time things just right.  This last time I visited they handed us a beer menu. I had not seen this before and once glancing at it I now know I'll be changing my drink selections from time to time, as there were some interesting less vanilla choices available.  If you're a local, there's a coupon that's recently surfaced for a free entree with a purchased entree, so use that and enjoy more of their wonderful beer selections.  Thank you guys! See you soon!",

The atmosphere inside is more restaurant-y than your typical PT's-type place (which is what we're used to in this area of town...boohoo). Moderately English. They had a pretty great food menu for happy hour, where everything is $5. Got your standard bar fare like sliders and tacos and some more British-y takes like sausages in puff pastry (which is yummy).

We went here lay night, Thursday night and partook in local news night which was 4 dollar drafts. We had 4 milk shake style beers that captured my heart. After getting nice and toasty, our waiter was supportive of us relocating to a pool table where we continued to try a few new beers. That was my kind of night.  Anyways, here's the gist of it. Shakespeare's has a rotating selection of beers so I am always able to try something new. The food is great for a pub restaurant, but I come for the beer. Service is usually good, and there is something different each day. Wednesday's I think they have trivia and Fridays they do karaoke. There's always enough parking and a chill crowd. When I want to drink socially, this is my go to place.",

    "text": "Dad and I checked this place out last Monday afternoon and were pleasantly surprised!  It was completely dead since it was about noon on a Monday...we were the only occupants of the restaurant aside from a lone barfly and the guy who took our order.  The decor is pretty cool and makes you feel like you're not necessarily eating at a place set in a strip mall of of Eastern Avenue. It's also quite dark, which is a nice atmospheric touch.  I ended up ordering Ian's Savory Meat Pie and Dad had a bacon cheeseburger. Both of them came with delicious potato wedges, and each entree tasted pretty dang good. The filling of the meat pie consisted of seasoned beef, peas and carrots. It definently warmed me up on a cold day.  I only knock this place because it is a little too expensive for the fare offered and because the service is a bit slow, although extremely friendly. They do have a happy hour with discounted appetizers though and a late night menu which appeared to have some good prices as well.",

Found the atmosphere to be delightful cozy, service, impeccable, and the menu affordable, and delicious. We weren't here to drink, but they do have an extensive beer menu, which I took advantage of. I love trying different beers, especially if the only way I can try them outside of a bar is in a 6 pack of bottles for 30 bucks. No thanks! Anyway we got a hodge podge of food. Buffalo Mac and Cheese, poutine with Guinness and onion gravy, and a Rueben sandwich. Buff was AWESOME. I love mac and cheese and this was fantastic. Poutine was good, not as magical as I wanted, because the idea of Guinness gravy sounded amazing. Oh well, still very good. The Rueben was ok, but I don't like Rueben Sandwiches, so that's an unfair judgement. It was pretty neutral in flavor so I could eat it. (Not a fan of corned beef) The price was very inexpensive for what we got and as I said the sevice was top notch. I don't know what this place is like usually, but it seemed fairly low key and quiet, which totally suits us. We will be back.",

    "text": "I want this to be a completely fair review. I write reviews for several websites as a destination expert and rarely reveal that fact. I have never written a Yelp review but this will be my first.  Our demographic is that we are local, retired, professionals probably not the crowd usually served by Shakespeare's. Today we decided to try lunch at Shakespeare's Grille and Pub. I few months ago we tried dinner and found a delightful array of beers, a casual atmosphere, and knowledge staff. We felt very welcomed as we experienced the menu and sampled a couple of the beers recommended. The waiter was a fountain of information about various brews both seasonal and standard. He had a wealth of knowledge regarding imports as well.   That evening we tried several offerings but the stand out was the crispy golden fish and chips. The fish was perfectly fried with a nice batter coating that was neither too thick or two thin. The chips were crispy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. The cole slaw was a very nice portion and had a nice dressing that was tangy, sweet, and not overly sauced with mayonnaise.   Today we visited for lunch and the experience was horrid. When we pulled up we noticed a unkempt looking smallish fellow sleeping in the patio area. We were running a few errands and had our little dog with us when we decided to stop for a quick lunch. We are very skilled in fostering animals and treat our own as a much loved member of the family. We often travel with our little dog and he is ever so spoiled. We expected to be in the business no more than 30 minutes. We intermittently run the air conditioner for the dog and have remote access to do so and we take turns checking on him every 10 minutes for the short time we are in dispose. This seemed reasonable on a day with the temperature being 67 degrees and his kennel was in the shade. After the first 10 minutes I went outside to start the air conditioning.  I was met by a lady who seemed genuinely concerned that there was a dog inside the car and unattended. I do understand that people can make judgments out of concern which may not be compatible with facts. I explained that he is very much attended and thanked her for her concern.  At that point the young man began spewing angry, and ill informed opinions about how we cared for our much loved companion. An animal companion who has traveled the nation in this same car with adoring care from his owners. The young man continued to escalate and nothing could convince him that he was incorrect in his judgment. At that point it was clearly an excuse to be angry, venomous, insulting, and abusive with no real concern for the animal. He might have originally been well meaning but he became bizarre.  There are not enough lines to express how vulgar, ignorant, and abusive his affect and language became. This included repeating that he hoped the dog died. Strange words for someone supposedly concerned for animal welfare.  It turns out that this young man entered Shakespeare's when he cooled slightly. His affect was completely different and it was Jekyll to Hyde scary. He was confronted about his behavior and he casually denied any responsibility and that was the end of that. I was so concerned for the safety of our dog and our car that I couldn't return to the dining area at all. I sat in the car and my husband as my surrogate discussed the situation with the waitress. She stated that the fellow was one of there \"best players\". I  don't know if that is pool, trivia, bar top poker, or something else but he was clearly representing an important asset to the bar.   I did have my meal to go and again the fish and chips are noteworthy. The food here is good. I wish I could honestly offer a four start review. I can not.. There are many nicer places to go where you can feel safe. I do hope this experience is not representative of their core base of customers. Beware if you venture into this type of situation that it is very unpleasant to be unprotected by an establishment from this sort of erratic behavior. They may have indeed acted if it had occurred inside their space  where it was witnessed instead of on the patio.  It is for the sake of future diners that we will call the owner to discuss the experience. I doubt that we will ever return. This was  twilight zone dining.",

When someone at our table ordered a chicken tiki masala and a soup the waiter rudely said \"woah that's way too much food!\" I've never heard of a waiter complain about someone ordering too much food. I can't understand why as a waiter you wouldn't want the bill to be higher, seeing as that usually means more tip money. There were about 80 people eating and drinking in the place and there was only one server and two bar tenders (I know because one of the comedians on stage mentioned them by name). Yes there was an amateur comedy show going on which I didn't mind. The food was mediocre at best. Also the Chicken tikki masala dish my friend ordered didn't have any chicken in it, when we mentioned it to the rude waiter he simply said \"it's shredded into the sauce\". The beer was good and the actual place is nice and spacious but they need to have more staff and a manager on sight. Terrible service, mediocre food probably won't be back unless it's to drink at the actual bar and not to eat.",

    "text": "One of my goals when I moved  to Las Vegas, close to 2 years ago now, was to find new places to venture to. To find great local places to call home and frequent  when I just didn't want to sit inside the house all night.  And when I find one I absolutely adore I just want to help out and promote the hell out of the establishment.  Shakespeare's Pub & Grill is one I feel deserves that type of promotion!  The first time I walked in the pub I thought I was definitely going to like it here.  First, It is a LOT bigger then it looks from the outside and since they added outdoor seating even more people can get the fantastic food they provide.  The pool table to the right and the dart board towards the back was my first indication and first good visual, as I scanned the entire place that this was definitely a True Pub.  As I walked up to the bar I heard the Jukebox playing 80's style music and instantly fell in love.    The bartender at the time was awesome!  We talked all about the opening of the place and the history of the owner (who by the way is a great guy and has an excellent Scottish accent) And since then each bartender I've talked to has been equally fun and interesting.  The food!  Well I've only been back 6 times and can't stop from ordering the Guinness wings which are exceptionally tasty.  I've also had the Pear and Blue Cheese Salad (I couldn't keep my fork from diving for more) Every bite was equally great. Another time I ordered the Mozzarella and Tomatoes and rolled my eyes back with happiness, it was just a simple lunch.    One of these days I will be able to have everything on the menu, but that is the fun of going back to a favorite spot.    So go check out the Shakespeare's Pub.  Show a little love to a local Vegas place off the strip and enjoy the food and Pub experience!",
