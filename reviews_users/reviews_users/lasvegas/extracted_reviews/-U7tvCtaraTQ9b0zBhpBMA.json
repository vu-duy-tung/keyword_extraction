First off it was Feb 15th, day after Valentine's Day, they charged me 33% more for the buffet, claiming a holiday event/weekend. But did not discover this till after the fact. You would expect something special for the upcharge! Absolutely not. Very limited selection! Tried 3 different vegies all were barely room temperature, I wish the health department was present checking temps. Most meats were overcooked, dry chicken smothered in sauces. I could go on... Yuck.",

All I remembered was I juicy and sweet them chocolate covered strawberries were.  This was the only buffet I tried during my brief stay so I can't compare it to other places in Vegas.  For 40 bucks though, I believe I did get my money's worth and I am very satisfied with it.  The service was excellent.  The selection was plentiful and thats important because I don't like seeing the same boring stuff over and over again.  Nice to have a great selection of food.",

    "text": "Oh the sweet glorious splendor that is the MGM Grand buffet! Yes, it is pricey. But so is the rest of Las Vegas in general. Gone are the days of cheap food and free-flowing booze, but I digress. What you do get for the price is a variety of  quality food and comfortable surroundings. The desserts are superb and they have a wide array of beverage options. After filling up at the buffet I like to head to the sports book, which is just off the main entrance. It's a good place to relax and bet on the ponies. I will have to say that the MGM grand as a whole has fallen off over the years. It used to be my go to place, but now they nickel and dime you pretty hard. $10 for parking is pretty outrageous, especially after spending well over $100 just at the buffet (no validation offered, I checked). But, this review is just for the buffet alone, hence the five stars.",

There is a wide selection of food, but some of it wasnt hot, you have to get your drinks yourself and the order is a bit messy. The scrambled eggs were bad. On the other hand, there is gluten free toast available, lots of nice desserts, the pineapple was amazing and the staff was very nice.   Although personally I think 34$ + tip is too much for what you can eat and what you get.   We came for brunch on a Friday around 10:30, there was no line (which is weird, but good cause we didnt have to wait). I would have preferred to go to the Bacchanal buffet, it seemed better in the reviews..",

    "text": "We ate here for brunch/lunch on a Saturday, and for two of us, it was around $56.00.  The price included unlimited champagne/mimosas, which for me, made the pricing more than fair.  They did not have fried shrimp, which I love, but had plenty of other options to make up for it.  Their brunch/lunch menu included prime rib, pizza, fried rice, thai chicken, tilapia, sushi, eggs, bacon, and various other breakfast/lunch items.  They also had a dessert bar that looked good, but I personally did not try.  I read some complaints about their service, but we did not run into any issues.  Our mimosa/water glasses were refilled promptly, and often without even needing to ask.  Our empty dishes were cleared by the time we returned from seconds/thirds/fourths, and the entire place in general seemed clean and well kept.  The line was long, but I can't really fault them for being crowded.  We didn't wait any longer than we had to, and with buffets, waiting in line is cancelled out by not having to wait for your food to be cooked/served.  Overall, I probably would have given this place 4 stars if they had fried shrimp.  3 or 3.5 stars since they did not.  I would return/recommend.",

I think our family enjoyed the crab legs the most. Desserts were nice small portions so we did not feel bad sampling a few. We voted it 3 stars because nothing wowed us.

I liked the Cajun selection since I'm a big seafood fan but I highly disliked the fact that they didn't tell us they were going to close the buffet 30 minutes after we had entered. I think it is fair to let your customers, who are about to pay $50.00 per person, know that they have 30 mins left to eat. Beware of shady people, but they fit right in with all MGM casino who seems to want to take every person for every little thing !",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I lower my expectations when I walk into a buffet right off the bat, this was no exception.   I made a few mistakes prior to coming tonight admittedly. Mistake number one, check Yelp! Two, check Yelp! Had I done this prior I would have saved myself $35. Yes another mistake made... I chose to put the tip on my credit card prior to service! FYI folks- probably best not to do this, especially here. Why you ask? Well you serve your own drinks. Your plates pile on the table until someone bothers to come by and take them after passing 20 times. So, you deserve your tip. You get your food and drinks and basically wait on yourself.   Now if you have ever gone to a buffet before that's not extremely busy you know the food sits there forever!!! Not here... I watched them change out almost full trays of food. They got a star for that. Even though the food I ate didn't taste great. Especially some being so bad I had to spit it out. Example: Red potato pieces so cooked they were black!!! Not just toasted but charred to the point of being inedible.  The other star I gave them was for the food being labeled vegetarian or gluten free. That is a extremely nice touch most places don't think of going to for people like myself who are vegetarian. I really appreciated that aspect.  Being an ex pastry chef I alway am drawn to Vegas buffet dessert sections. This one let out the looser horn ... BIG TIME!!!! For being MGM Grand there was nothing Grand about this buffet or dessert section!!! It was awful!!! It can be compared to something you would find at a nursing home. By far the worst I have seen here in Vegas.  I expect more from a property like this than what was being displayed, especially for the price. I recommend going to another property for a good buffet than coming here, sorry.",

For the weekend champagne brunch, this was about 27 buckaroos.   Standard buffet fare. No seafood other than deep fried swai (an Asian catfish), some sushi rolls, and lox. I didn't expect any, but it would have been nice for a full fare customer like me. I really liked the tri-tip at the carving station. That comprised roughly a third of my meal.  The rest was some mashed potatoes and gravy, a few fried chicken legs, and a piece of corn on the cob. Oh...and about 6 glasses of champagne : )",

It was awesome that were no lines and we were immediately seated.  Though I was definitely hurting from the 6 bottles of drank that we killed the night before, I managed to appreciate the quality of the brunch selections.

Fresh omelets or any style eggs made to order at the Omelet station.  Mouth watering meats at the carving station.  Best cup of coffee anywhere!  Seriously!  Very nice wait staff.  Though, our cashier was borderline rude.  Not a great way to begin our sit down, but our server was super nice, as well as the rest of the staff.  We have eaten here before a few years back for the Dinner buffet and it was incredible --  wanted to have a great breakfast this time, and was not disappointed. My favorite sweet treat was the breaded pineapple (served warm)--So delicious!  I went back for more!!",

I stayed at NY NY, but we had a coupon for two free buffets here.  We went about 4:45-5 p.m. and they were setting up for dinner.   They have a lot of good variations of food. Seafood, Mexican, Asian, etc.  I freakin' LOVE crablegs....not gonna lie. They had cold crablegs over ice that were ALREADY SPLIT in half for you. How awesome is that?!  Needless to say, I buried my face in about 2-3 plates of them. Very good! The sushi was pretty average, nothing special about it. Lots of good dishes for vegetarians. Lots of good meaty dishes too.  The dessert bar was pretty neat. I didn't enjoy it as much as I could've as I stuffed myself with dinner.   I'd go back. But a word to the wise....get there BEFORE everyone else does. The line gets ridiculous to get into the place.",

Some random casino I went to in suburban Chicago had a much better buffet which was slightly shocking.

I would rather eat here than at Bellagio buffet because the last time I ate at Bellagio it doesn't seem to offer that much food.   There are abundant amount of desserts, but it's located at the far end of the buffet.  Overrall, this place is really good. Plenty of jumbo cocktail shrimps and cold snow crab legs. I wish it was steam through.  It's best to go at 3:30 and pay the lunch price and get dinner food once it strikes 4pm.

MGM Grand is an amazing but the buffet is the worst buffet I have EVER been to. I've been to many buffets in Las Vegas this is by far the ABSOLUTE WORST BUFFET in history. The mussels were tough, the roast was tough , only thing that was decent was the sushi. The staff is very friendly the price is only $20.99 which is great. But if you want to eat at a better buffet go to the Paris or something. The Stratosphere buffet is better then MGM Grand.",

They actually have the steak station open this time and when you walk into the buffet the smell of the grilled steak just makes your mouth water and it turn out pretty tasty. The crab legs were tasty and delicious that night as well.

The crab legs are not as good as Bellagio's or Wynn's.  in fact, I'm not sure if this is a  sign of quality or what, but the crab legs at MGM didn't  pull cleanly out of the shells as they do at the aforementioned Bellagio or Wynn buffets.   I found myself spending too much time trying to pull the meat out of the shells, despite the fact that they are already split cleanly in half. The remainder of what I tried was ok, but nothing special at all.  I go to a LV buffet intent on eating back any money I've gambled away, so I have higher expectations than this.  Like some other casinos, MGM Grand Buffet currently offers a buffet all day long.  For $30 ($40 on weekends) you can have mediocre buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner instead of just one meal.  Need to step it up MGM!",

My friend and I went for brunch while on vacation and it was so good we didn't eat for the rest of the day.  I think the price was $22, but since it was Saturday, for $2.50 more you could get unlimited champagne (cheap champagne, yes, but add some of the unlimited orange juice and it made a quite passable mimosa).  The food selection was unreal.  We tried everything - ham, prime rib, incredible ravioli, made-to-order eggs, great sausage gravy, some unnameable weird salad...the selection was endless and much better than any of the other buffets around the MGM, especially Mandalay Bay .  Favorites were the pastas, fresh guacamole, carrot cake, fruit selection...  Sometimes we had to wait for refills, but we were there for at least two hours and never got told to hurry up or denied anything.",

Everything was bland.  There were no oysters and get this.....they have to give you the seafood.  They won't allow you to get it yourself.   And if you want drinks....you can get them YOURSELF.....there is no service.  I spoke with the supervisor and told him how horrific it was.  I asked him if he would pay that kind of money to eat this and he could not give me an answer.  I don't blame him.    No issues with the employees but for almost $125 for literally the worst buffet I have ever had....there are just no words to say.  Please re-think your choice.  I really hope they change the quality of their selection because I don't think i will come back.    I already expect the usual reply of \" we will let our chefs know \".

I feel the buffet is a bit over priced. $33 a head for early bird breakfast and mimosas that are supposed to be bottomless. The food was average at best; nothing \"grand\" about this buffet. The mimosas are not brought to the table, you have to actually go to the bar and get your mimosas. We were at our table for about 20 minutes waiting for the bar to open. The hosts kept telling us the bartender was coming soon but we just ended up waiting even more.   No fruits on a buffet line? What's going on here. It may be time for a restaurant rescue. The best thing was the smoked salmon and that wasn't even that great. The salmon had a great smoke taste but was chewy.   Would I return? No. I have had better experiences in other places that do not have the Vegas hype attached to it. This experience further adds to my feelings of Las Vegas being overrated.",

For a buffet that cost $43-45 per head I would have expected more. The brisket was dried out and tough. The shrimp were okay but one a few pieces felt warm to the touch to I decided not to eat anymore. It was bottomless mimosas, but it tasted like the orange juice had been sitting out or something because it had a very bitter taste to it. So bottomless meant a couple of sips. The eggs Benedict on waffle was bad because the waffle was soggy and the sauce had no flavor and since it's on a buffet line the eggs is not poached and runny but rather a hard boiled egg.   I usually am very happy to leave a good tip at a buffet because the waiters usually come around and clear plates and provide us with drinks. But here the waitress seated us and then told us it's a self serve drink bar with one of those fancy drink machines and the mimosa bar that you had to walk up to get it myself.   With so many great options for buffets around, I would not recommend coming here. For the same price or slightly more money you could get really good food and a lot better service.",

Well, rest assured that they have graduated. Everything was fresh. The crab legs were fantastic. I say stop in if you are on that end of the strip.

The crab legs were great and easy to eat. The shrimp was tasty. The carving station stuff were mediocre. There are a plethora of other items like a whole aisle of chinese, a whole aisle of italian along with the pizza station and few mexican. The orange chicken and noodles were good. The desert station was a bit dis-appointing. The only item that i enjoyed there was the lychee flavored italian ice.

The options at MGM were extremely limited! They had a small selection of fruit (no grapes, strawberries, peaches) the Mexican section had no meat choices to make tacos, they did however have guacamole and tortillas didn't understand for what, but they had them. Small Italian selection! Sushi with no sriracha (hot sauce). No pizza! They were out of Brisket and it was only 6 PM and they opened for dinner at 3! My wife and I waited for Friday because it's the Grand dinner and it was suppose to be better than the week buffet. The grand buffet offered crab legs and Wifey really wanted them. Big waste of money!  $88 for the both of us and I wish I would have just gone to Planet Hollywood! What MGM offers is something you can get at any cheap hotel in Vegas for half the price! Needless to say I will never go back to MGM for there buffet and I suggest you don't either. I would like to add the waitress was very nice and was searching high and low for my sriracha, she said that they use to have it but didn't know why they didn't anymore. Sounds like the MGM just stopped caring about  its customers.",

It's only gone downhill. I only wish I could have the experience of other high-star reviewers, but alas...maybe I'm picky. First off, in my previous experience...I've told others to just eat at a restaurant instead of this buffet. This time around, I didn't follow my own advice because buffets are fun to experiment with and I was hungry that day, had time to kill and a food/bev credit on my account. Well...I experimented with EVERYTHING and it was all trash (for lack of better words). I tried the spinach/cheese shells and threw them out. It's my favorite food! I still can't fathom how one manages to mess that up, it's fairly simple. I tried the sausage, the tacos, the pizza sticks, fried Twinkie...YOU NAME IT. Even the cupcakes were garbage. Listen, I'm not a wasteful person and I felt bad giving the waiter an entire plate of food on at least 3 occasions in one sitting, but I couldn't consume it. What's the point? In the end, I was still hungry so I decided to get some nutrients and eat a salad. You can't really mess that up can you?  One more thing, I'm not sure if it was only during this time, but they increased the lunch and dinner prices significantly...over 50%. So for two people, it costs $84 (includes taxes) to sub-par food. No thank you. You just expect better in Vegas. Please take my advice, eat at an actual restaurant to get higher quality food -- and most likely for less.  I won't be back.",

The salad isn't bad and the crab legs come aplenty. The only items I would stay away from are the Chinese dishes and pizza -- but hey, if you want pizza, there are obviously places that specialize in that on the strip. Finally, the dessert is well-presented and equally tasty. Needless to say, I will be returning here each time I stay at MGM.",

    "text": "This is one of the best buffets I've eaten at in Vegas! We went for a weeknight dinner and were very surprised by the quality and quantity of the selections, despite what some reviews might say!   The highs: -Prime Rib was on point! I enjoyed mine at a beautiful medium-rare but if you like it more done (like my girlfriend) they will be happy to sear it off on the flat top to your liking. -Nachos! This buffet has a bubbly, gooey vat of nacho cheese sauce near a larger tray of chips by their Mexican station where you can customize it with fresh salsas and guacamole. -Orange chicken was really great! Sometimes fried food in sauce can get soggy when left out but this offering was very crispy and held its integrity while still being smothered in tasty sauce. -The peel 'n eat shrimp was fresh and tasty. Add a squeeze of lemon and a cup of cocktail sauce and you're set!  The lows: Unfortunately there were a few things we didn't enjoy (not everything can be perfect) -The cheese enchiladas should be avoided. The sauce was reminiscent of taco bell mild sauce, which is not something that goes smothered over limp enchiladas. -The desert was lackluster. I did like the apple cobbler but that's all that was good. The sorbet was overly sweet and the pastries were lacking in flavor and on the dry side.  I know what MGM Resorts is capable of and I know they can improve their offerings. Overall in would highly recommend this buffet on the abundance of the great offerings and value for the money. I will definitely be coming back on my next visit.",

It was hard to cut through my prime rib with a butter knife but maybe I missed where the cutting knives were. There are tons of desserts to pick from some that I've never heard of before.

Juan at the omelette station/egg station is such a treat and is so hard working, omelettes were wonderful. All of the FOH staff were very friendly and kind and the bussers were always making sure no empty plates lingered.   As mentioned above, I went there two days in a row and all of the options were exactly the same. It felt a little repetitive and might have been nice if there was more of a different variety the next day. Nonetheless, the food was very yummy!",

Don't get me wrong, it's not the caliber of a buffet like the Bellagio, but it is good for what it is.  I would put it on the scale of the Monte Carlo or Planet Hollywood buffets, but better than both of those.  We were lucky - we arrived at 7pm on a Friday night and there was no line.    I liked the food.  There was a good variety of meats, veggies, seafood and ethnic foods.  My hubby had the crab legs and called them \"above average, though just barely\".  I liked the Mexican section. The desserts were also a cut above the average buffet.  I told my hubby next time we are in town we have to go to one of the more high end buffets.  However, I will remember our good experience here and we'll be back I'm sure!",

    "text": "Would like to have given five stars: 17th Anniversary MGM Grand, Las Vegas, Long Time Customer We visit Las Vegas yearly for our anniversary. For our 17th we returned to MGM Grand (where we spent our honeymoon). We have stayed at MGM Grand 15-20 times and various MGM Grand properties perhaps 40 times. Fabulous trip other than morose clerk & buffet.  We have been to this buffet dozens and dozens of times and LOVED it, but this time the food was not fresh.  I'm a picky eater but my husband is not.  He and I both tried several different dishes and putting them aside after a bite, even the desserts were substandard.  It was later in the evening but nowhere near closing time.    I had an Italian dish, Manicotti, did not taste fresh at all, the shells were rubbery like it had been sitting out under the lights on the buffet for to long and the slightly sweet, mild, creamy ricotta was runny, almost like clabbered milk so one bite and I  pushed it away and tried something else.  Made a spinach salad with blue cheese sprinkles and blue cheese dressing, it had a tangy, gross, taste,  did not taste fresh at all, pushed that away and tried their pizza, which, when all else fails is usually a descent standby. The pizza crust was worse than the cheapest frozen pizza,  did not taste fresh at all, almost rubbery,  so pushed that away and got a few tiny desserts.  Took a bite of each and they were not horrible but not good either.  The quality was far beneath that of a grocery bakery.  Very disappointing.  In the past 16 years I've never had a problem or complaint with MGM Grand's buffet.  Many times we would eat breakfast and dinner there a few days in a row.  This time the food was so bad we did not return the entire trip.  Additionally, it's totally serve yourself now, which isn't a big deal but you are paying an enormous amount for a buffet to begin with and wine is extra.  I believe it is included on the weekends with an even higher priced buffet.  Your money would be better spent at one of medium priced restaurants on the MGM property at this point.  The buffet used to be a fun, inviting place to have a meal.  Now, it feels like you are on a conveyor belt and there is virtually no service other than the ladies who ring you up before you go in and the host/hostess who take you to your table and scramble away.  The prices have gone way up over the years while the quality of food and service have gone down, way down.    I hope this is a trend that ends.  It would be nice to have a reasonably priced buffet, with fresh food, home made desserts, and service in the hotel where you staying instead of making the trip to the Mirage buffet. `  Tip:  Apparently they add 18% tip to large parties, however, there is no service, it's serve yourself food and drinks, hummmm",

Our server was quick to refill drinks and clear plates  Breakfast, less impressive, they need to have more than one person preparing eggs/omellettes to order.  Corned beef hash was disappointingly dry.  Fruit selection mediocre.  Biggest hit for me was the yogurt with fat bluegerries/raspberries.  Again, server was very good.  Prices were higher than they should be, -1 star for that.  That said, this is probably the best Vegas buffet I've been to in a long time (to me, better than spice market, rio, caesars, big kitchen, dishes, flamingo).",

I have no complaints about anything else I ate at the buffet, except for the sushi which was mushy, and didn't taste right.  The rice was not flavored at all, and it had the wrong consistency.

    "text": "Richard Pro here with another review.  I go to Vegas every Christmas and I've become a seasoned expert on Las Vegas buffets for the past seven years.   Come here for dinner, avoid breakfast and lunch. As buffets go, most in Vegas are similar and the interior makes a big difference in meal choice. I've been here for Christmas feasts where the price skyrockets to $35 a person, and I've been here for normal dinners.   There's a great variety of food here. If you know how to eat at buffets, you know the quality of a buffet is largely based on how expensive the food they offer is. Most people are neophytes and don't know this, and they'll go to a buffet to enjoy a plate of fried rice for $20. I enjoy rare prime rib here, and a few years back they had excellent sushi. For some reason about 4 years ago every single buffet in Vegas changed their sushi.  The wait is typically long. Go and look at the lions while having someone in your family wait in line.   I like the atmosphere here. It's large, spacious, well lit, tables and booths are clean. Buffet tables look nice and food is appealing. Definitely a very grand feel to it. I enjoy it immensely. Service is as good as other Vegas buffets offer.   5 stars. My favorite dinner buffet in Vegas, but Wynn may be the one exception. Unfortunately, I have not been able to go to Wynn yet due to the dinner line starting at 4:15ish.",

TIP: get a table by 10:40 because you pay for the breakfast buffet price(8 dollars cheaper than lunch), and the still have the breakfast items while they start bringing out the lunch stuff, so its like brunch!...EAT HERE IF YOU ARE NOT A PICKY LITTLE PUNK.",

They had smoke salmon but it was prepared differently than the \"raw\" looking kind... it was more cooked through... so I passed on it. I actually enjoyed it more than the breakfast at Bellagio and Mandalay Bay.",

MGM Grand mercifully serves \"Brunch\" until 4:00 PM on Weekends, just in case you slept in. Which you probably did.  Their brunch consists of a pretty nice selection of acceptable breakfast items, including eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuits and gravy, oatmeal, cereal, waffles, omlette station, etc. It's all ok, but none of it is amazing.   They also offer a lot of their regular dinner stuff too. Slices of turkey breast at the carving station, pasta, salad, Mexican food, desert bar, and quite a bit more. Again, none of the food was amazing, but none of it offensive either.   I had a brilliant idea too late to utilize it: breakfast tacos! They had taco shells and a bunch of stuff to make normal tacos with, BUT you could combine that with the breakfast stuff (bacon, eggs, hash browns, etc) and make breakfast tacos! Unfortunately, I had this stroke of genious as I was about to have an actual stroke at the end of the meal, and I couldn't possibly eat another bite.   It wasn't the greatest food, and it wasn't the greatest thing for me health-wise, but I won't lie: if I were at the MGM Grand at breakfast time again, I'd be right back in there. I'll be the guy with the breakfast tacos...",

The food: I love love love all kinds of melons, and their watermelons and honey melons (or whatever you Americans calls them) were fresh so I had a bunch of them  Their veggie pizza was really yummy, I only wish I had more space in my belly to eat more than one slice (I discovered them after already eating like five plates)  Their sushi station was not impressive; they had three kinds of sushi that all tasted like something I could have bought at Ralphs... veggie springs rolls were a much better choice.   The vegetarian station was lame. I am not a vegetarian, but I love the food, and I can just imagine the disappointment for someone who actually is vegan or vegetarian. My heart goes out to you girls and boys. They had steamed veggies, and some Indian curry salad, etc, but I did not try it. The hummus was actually pretty good!  Their salads were ok, I really liked their salad with ceasar dressing on it...  The best part of the buffet was their desserts! Small selections of a variety of sweets!   Overall the buffet was ok, but I don't know if it was worth $27 plus tax.",

I really enjoyed heir cheese potato balls (I'm NOT a huge fan of potatoes) and heir shrimp ceviche! Their smoked salmon is also very fresh. The waiter was very friendly and gave great service. I wish I remembered his name. We always stay at the MGM and we really enjoy the buffet. Not sure why the reviews are so bad!",

Cool part was wild birds were flying around the restaurant looking for food people were dropping at their tables ! Lol not sure how they got into the mgm grand . They were tiny and cute !",

The fried chicken is dry: wrong The crab legs are \"fishy\": wrong They don't have a good selection: wrong  We went at 5pm on a Saturday and we paid and were seated within 10 minutes. Everything we ate was hot, cooked well and had great flavor.   I had fried chicken, mashed potatoes, Mac n cheese, pizza, cheese tortellini, garlic bread, tiramisu and cookies. All fantastic.   Wife had shrimp, crab legs, prime rib and a few deserts. She loved it.   The price is steep but it's a Vegas hotel buffet. At some point you have to be honest with yourself about what you're getting yourself into.",

The variety and food quality were terrible. SAVE yourself the $35 and go eat somewhere else.  Ive never heard of try tip \"needing to be served WELL DONE only\" um sure thanks, extra extra dry. I asked for a piece of the turkey, I didn't even notice that the guy had given me an entire piece of PURE jiggly fat. I was so grossed out!  Can they at least take the time to defrost the shrimp? It was frozen solid, of course after a while it will thaw but in the mean time that percent of customers eats frozen shrimp lol  They had 2 dishes of \"indian food\" there was no rice. I mean, not even a pasta area?  About every other buffet in vegas is better than this.",

After meandering thru the casino, we finally found it. We were promptly greeted by friendly smiling faces and taken to our seats. everything seemed very clean and fresh. But, I am sad to report that this was a terrible dining experience. The was perfect and rather on point with customer service, but the food was terrible.I was really looking forward to a fabulous buffet experience, but that just didn't happen. The buffet is over priced for bad food. I had lobster scrambled eggs, eggs Benedict, fried potatoes, a blitz or something. I took 1 bite of each thing and filled the rest of my stomach with iced tea. Everything I tried was horrible. I tried more items than I listed, but literally everything I tried was horrible.   2 stars is for the very courteous attentive staff and servers.",

I did manage to get a halfway decent omelet but it took the guy way too long to make it and he was not friendly. Our waitress was friendly on the other hand, but when did everything become self serve? You now have to go get your own bar drinks and regular drinks...even water. So the waitress is just a glorified bus boy.  The selection was sadly lacking. A vegas buffet with just a bit of sushi like a california roll and one veggie Indian dish? No other asian dishes at lunch? Very bizarre. They had an egg and chorizo stuffed eggroll which was actually hot and the execution could have been a success if the chorizo had been edible. Tried a couple of dessert items but they were rubbery and not worth the calories. Even with a dining credit I'm not sure it's worth the time.",

Second just as before we were treated excellent by everyone and service was quick and responsive.  Fresh made omelette was very good as was the majority of the food. Bacon great!(I mean it's bacon). The sausage was typical buffet sausage. Mimosas were good.  (And kept getting better) lol.  Sometimes I feel people compare apples to oranges. If you want a five star meal don't go to a buffet. For Thursday brunch it was 19$ plus 9$ more for unlimited champagne and/or mimosas. We would and probably will go back.",

The one thing I'd complain about is ummmm I found a freaken hair on a plate lol. Where the clean plates go. Wasn't that big of a deal if you check your plates before putting food on them. Lol I get they are going green from straws but after seeing a hair on the plate then I wonder how clean are the cups? Lol but anyways I got so much food for the brunch times! It was worth the money. The bakery guy was super nice and offered certain kinds to me since I seemed indecisive but really I was thinking if I'm down to keep eating soooo many sweets hahaha.  Definitely worth a trip here if you're staying at this hotel or even as a local!",

After 9:00am to about 3:00pm it becomes a Brunch, but I was up early and mostly in the mood for breakfast. Honestly for $20 with tax, it's not a bad breakfast buffet.  Overall they have an impressive selection for a breakfast buffet without the Brunch portion added yet. You have your basics such as eggs, sausage, and bacon; however, your spread also includes smoked salmon, a carving station, an omelette station, various hot pastries stuffed with eggs or sweets, and even a few Mexican dishes when I attended. They even have some stuff like Mexican rice, beans, white rice, sushi, and some pre-prepared omelettes including a Cail-omelette which had beans and vegetables.   That said, is everything amazing and out of this world? Honestly, no, but it's a breakfast buffet. If I want top of the line sushi, I would go to Morimoto down the hall. But some dishes do stand out over others. The corned beef hash was my personal favorite, and the omelettes were good as well. The biscuits and gravy are okay since the biscuit was tasty, but the gravy was meh. Meanwhile the tri-tip brisket wasn't bad at all, and the smoked salmon was awesome. The bacon and sausage looked good, but I was meat out with the other dishes.  Overall I say for $20 on the strip during a weekday, go for it. I've seen similar prices at worse sit-down experiences in my life, and it's not a bad way to start your day. Especially since they have good coffee.",

I was too hungry to capture photos of all our players.  I will say its one of the best buffets on the strip where you don't spend $50 and up.  Im sure the more you spend the better quality budget but that's not True.  If you've been to Vegas then you know im being honest.",

I don't care how good a cook you are you're only going to get such mediocre meats. Quite frankly if you've got the Vegas deal where you buy one get one free the meal is like $40 per person plus tax. But if you've got the buy one get one free great.  But let me just tell you the prime rib and I'm a prime rib lover was horrible! It was not marbled it might as well just been roast beef it was really tough. I got my girlfriend an end cut she likes and tried asked cook it medium because it looked a little thick in a little bit on the dryer side. I love it medium rare.  My piece was second in from the end. Started off looked juicy and within a few minutes of being on my plate it was dried up and pretty much almost impossible to eat. The outer part that was my favorite where the seasonings are at, you know what I'm talking about if your prime rib lover was good , way under seasoned. Maybe a little bit pepper maybe just a little bit of salt but no shallots,rosemary, garlic.  They were making shrimp to order and any of the many different concoctions of shellfish if you're into it or crab claws. I thought they would be doing the thinner crab legs that they had shown online with that were already cracked and unfortunately they had crab claws and legs but not the longer legs that were all the associated with when you think of crab legs probably frozen, they were dry inside shell, some were brown. Regardless Omar who was the chef behind that area was very lively and attentive making special sauces with garlic, wine , red chili pepper and butter and just really whooped it up.  I appreciated him for that and gave him a $5 tip. Bbq babyback ribs,  were way dry, probably from night before, just overly sauced. One dishmade me drool. It was lamb ribs that was just very tender yummy in an ossobuco sauce. I could have eaten plates and plates of that.  I really enjoyed the grilled brussels sprouts with bacon and onion. But not enough high end unless youre a seafood person. Sushi looked ok, but im not into buffet sushi. Now the desserts they were not really good. My girlfriend's a baker loves desserts they were just average at best.  You have to get your own beverage which sucks.  Get in seafood line start there get your shrimps on and then walk over and get your meats. I would suggest the New York or top sirloin that they were grilling to order looked a little more appealing than the prime rib. Unfortunately they also had brisket it was really overly cooked very dry. They also had sausages up there but didn't want to get filled up on sausage. I wanted to love it, but was sad when leaving. Our server kept coming by and picking your plate and leaving napkins, and i still left her a $5, & not sure why, really no service per say.  Oh well thank god we had a buy 1 get 1 free buffet or I would have complained to management.",

    "text": "If you are going to eat here, come the night before a big fight...for some reason they do a better job with the food and put out a couple nice items to impress the extra company at MGM.  DO EAT: -The items on the grill in back...NY strip steak is cooked to your liking and pork ribs had a nice chipotle rub (didn't even need sauce). -Snow crab. This place does the best job at keeping the snow crab moist and flavorful. Not only is it sliced in half for you, but they keep the tray full of water, the crab well stocked and put about 50 lemon wedges in for flavor. -The coffee out of the dispenser wasn't bad either, in fact the whole beverage station was a nice new recent addition.  AVOID: -The desserts. All of them. The bread pudding was dry and overcooked and had nothing to sauce it...sorry, white chocolate sauce meant for the ice cream doesn't double as Creme Anglaise. The Oreo cheesecake tasted boxed...and nothing else really appealed.   OVERALL: If you are a fan of steak and crab legs, you can work a good meal here...",

Having a great expectation, i came here on the first day of the MGM Grand staying to start off my trip to LV with fantastic meals even though i ve been frugal in an everyday life. Imagined that this buffet is great, i dressed up to fit on a high-end restaurant. Soon after getting in the restaurant, i regretted the way i wore. This restaurant is below than casual. My mom and i arrived around 6 o'clock  and there was no crazy line out there. However, the hostesses were very cold and my appetite had gone already and i didn't want to eat here. But my mom is too old to move to an another buffet place (because she was very excited to eat dinner at the buffet), i reluctantly fallowed her and had a seat.  The food is mediocre. There were many ethnic food like American, Asian, Greek, Spanish. However, every food was not delicious at all. Even as a Asian, i tasted the Chinese food and it was a disappointing. The feature is almost there but the taste was no character. This was not well made. Supposed by everyone, Chinese food made by Chinese chef, Mexican food made by Mexican chef. the desserts made by patisserie. All taste were the same mediocre.   Everything made out of cheap. For example, the crab legs, these were too thin and nothing left inside the shell and very salty.   Even though i have been so many buffets out there like Aria, Caesar Place... this experience was the worst.",

MGM mix it up, keep it fresh and have smaller sizes to make sure your food is always great. Also give your staff a raise for the great customer they provided for those who worked the lunch buffet on Tuesday 2/28/17. Or at least show them his message.",

Everything at the hot food bar, lots of variety there, was exceptional, a wonderful fresh salad bar, omelette bar and carved meats were tender and amazing, and unlimited all you can drink mimosas.

I can't have dairy so couldn't have any desert items as they didn't offer anything for vegans. Your drinks are also self serve which was kinda a hassle.

I'm not a big waffle eater but I grabbed one of their mini round waffles and that ish was banging! The steak from the carving table was good too. They even provided grated horseradish and horseradish sauce. So yummy. The eggs were pretty average tasting. Out of the entire buffet, that's all I wanted really. But they had a lot of other food options.   The coffee they served here was delicious. No cream needed. No sugar needed.

In the magazines that are printed prices are different.  $40.00 per person ( no where does it say how much it costs at door until she rings it up)for that food yuck!  I would have gone to a nice restaurant with better atmosphere for the money we spent!  Horrible but i guess everyone has their own opinions but horrible experience!",

I really do not expect to be disappointed at breakfast, I mean hell, if McDonalds can get it right for billions of folk, why can't this place?  Everything seemed like it was left on the burners overnight. Dry tasteless , disgusting eggs, bacon, cheese blintzes, some gross beef crap, the list is endless, whatever they had out just sucked.   The other restaurants in the MGM where great, so I was really shocked that this place was so horrible.  They need to get a new executive chef to just tweak the preparation a bit and at least get this to the 3.0 to 3.5 range.",

The food is not that hot and the taste was meh. The dessert and drinks section is decent. The staff is very attentive to clearing your dishes- which is the only reason why I gave this 2 rating instead of 1. I noticed a lot of other people left very quickly.

Though, by Vegas standards, it isn't terrible compared to what meals cost at other restaurants.    I will say that the selection and quality of food available at the breakfast buffet was impressive and I had no trouble finding a lot of good (taste wise, anyway) options to choose from.    For the convenience factor as much as selection and relative price, I found the buffet to be a good option for breakfast if you are looking to make a big meal out of it.  Otherwise, there are options in the food court where you can pay a good bit less for a more targeted selection of breakfast items.",

    "text": "Ended up here on Saturday night after deciding not to go to the buffet in mandalay due to the wait there  Even though there were only 3 people ahead of us in line at the cashier, it took forever because the cashiers were so slow. The guy who would make sure you would get seated was very nice along with our waiter and the bus people taking old plates. The employees at the food stations were also very nice and approachable. I have to give an extra props to the bus staff though because we never had a build up of old plates because they would be there to take them  The food was decent, but nothing super special other than the new York strip steak and the prime rib. They were the only things worthy in my opinion at the buffet. The prime rib was very tender and moist and tasted great. The new York was very well seasoned, and cooked a perfect medium and was very flavorful. Everything else was pretty bland, especially the desserts. Most of them had very little flavor which upset me because the Oreo cheesecake just tasted like mush, and the key lime tart was also very plain tasting. The one thing that really got me mad about the dessert selection was for MGM advertising as \"GRANDer\" they didn't even have a gelato bar. Get on the trend MGM, wicked spoon at the Cosmo has it, the buffet at aria has it, cravings at mirage has had it for awhile  Overall, I wouldn't come back at the $35 price point. I would much rather go to the wicked spoon buffet or bellagio buffet",

Nothing very imaginative, but you can certainly leave very full. Price isn't great, but better than others, and the line wasn't long. If you're just looking to fill up on a decent meal for a relatively low price, go for it. Foodies should head elsewhere.",

I did try some cheesebread that was OK.   The desserts, and free soda is all that I had.  There was creme brule, and some pudding dishes.. not bad, but not worth paying full pop for this.  Look before you go.  Keep in mind everything is lowest possible quality. MGM is cutting corners where ever.     If you don't care about food quality, there was a promo for $30 all you can eat, all day long.  So you can go to breakfast, lunch AND dinner, and chow down until you pass out.   Nice was to keep people on the property.  You'd have to eat breakfast or lunch AND dinner to make it worthwhile.  Breakfast and lunch combined is about the same price as the deal.",

And no trip to Vegas is complete until you've eaten at least at one buffet during your stay.   The buffet, is your typical Vegas spread. They had a neat mashed potatoe cake bar which looked great and was fun to have made to order but the end product wasn't all that stellar. I was totally diggin the gnochi that I tasted. Yeah, I know all that food and I went back for more gnochi. I'm not huge seafood fan but other members of my party threw down with the crab legs and peeled shrimp. That's just too much work for me! I'm much more into instant gratification.   I enjoyed the NY strip steak cooked to order on the grill. MMMmmm meat!! They also had the typical carving stations and tons of salads.  Desserts weren't memorable except for a fruit tartlet that I had.  Ah, thank God for stretchy pants!!",

It was a good option for us because we wanted to stay at the pool that day. However, it seems hard to fit three meals into the day unless you get up before 9 AM. The breakfast closes at 11 and lunch closes at 2:30, I think.   We wanted to have some breakfast since we'd been skipping it all week we were in town. The crepe lines were long and people were fairly pushy. It made you question the whole buffet thing. I mean people, there is enough to go around!   In general, I would say that the food here is edible if you choose carefully, but there is nothing with perhaps the exception of dessert which is truly good. It's all bland and doing the all-day buffet makes you feel a bit queasy by the end of the day.   The best bits were the fresh melon, the mini-desserts at the dinner buffet which were tasty and even artistic with white chocolate shavings and other details. They were stingy with the crab and shrimp which was annoying. You have to ask and it is given reluctantly.   All in all, only go here if it saves you money and you happen to be staying here. We tried to spend about $80 a day on food and this buffet enabled us to stick to it for at least one = )",

The salad options were good and I thought the veggie pizza was tasty.  Service is great, the servers refilled my drink and took away dirty plates in a timely manner. They also have a chef grilling steaks and ribs to order, but they were both on the bland side. The dessert bar is plentiful, but not nearly as high of a caliber as Aria's Dessert Buffet.

    "text": "Having missed out on the traditional, cliched activities expected of travelers to Las Vegas - excessive booze, collecting the entire set of rent-a-floozy trading cards from the Hispanic worthies stationed along the Las Vegas Strip, watching a Celine Dion show and waking up with an embarrassing tattoo, I attempted the one activity that is actually available to those on a ridiculously small per diem: a Las Vegas buffet.  A friend who used to live in Vegas spoke glowingly about the MGM Grand Buffet, so based on his recommendation, a healthy dose of morbid curiosity, and the fact that it was a few dozen feet from the elevator, I chose to check it out.  Things got off to an ominous start when there was a 15-minute wait for a half-full restaurant. Apparently, $32.45 is the price for a meal during the \"slow\" time of week - a little after 8 on a Thursday night. As a reference, the GSA's recommended per diem for meals and incidentals for Las Vegas is $71/day.  I tried to eat things that I don't normally get and that meant mostly protein while avoiding the pizza and carbs. Since the pasta looked singularly unimpressive and the pizza - while having other varieties beyond the usual cheese and pepperoni varieties - they all looked like they'd been under the heat lamp longer than John Boehner in a spray tan booth.  I started with the crab legs and shrimp. The former clearly thawed, but had been cut while frozen in a manner which left the inedible internal tissue firmly wedged within the meat requiring extra effort to separate even with the plastic specialty fork they helpfully provide. The shrimp were deveined and beheaded, but that's it. Even when you think you have all the shell off the bug, there's always a piece left to wedge between your teeth. Not really anything new, they leave the shells on to save money and slow you down so you don't pig out on these, but these were unusually difficult to shell for some reason. At least they were fresh.  Undaunted, I went for the roast beast - blood rare, and just above body temperature - just the way I like it. Mostly tender, but not the most flavorful piece and the graded horseradish did a very thorough job of clearing sinuses that I didn't know I had. This more than made up for the flavorless creamed variety.  After that, it was downhill. The Italian Bread Salad was lacking something, the marinated mushrooms were well oiled, but someone skimped on the other ingredients. The sliced pork in mustard sauce was dry and the sauce watery - both components needing more flavor.  All was not completely lost, the waiter was on his toes clearing plates and refreshing drinks. I tipped him 25% because he was friendly and did his job well. The miniature pastries at the dessert bar were certainly ornamental and clearly that department had the right idea about presentation. What appeared to be freshly-made chocolate and pistachio ice creams were very rich and delicious. However, none of this was enough to make this worth the money.  I could've bought one of the numerous homeless persons distributed across the pedestrian walkways a nice dinner at McDonalds and taken myself to a HomeTown Buffet and come out with a similar gastronomic result and come out about $10 ahead.",

I ate a lot of crab legs and shrimp to get my $$'s worth even though they weren't that good tasting.  The sushi looked as if it had been sitting there for a couple of days, but other than that everything looked appetizing.    Salad bar gets an A, Mexican bar gets a C+,  Meats section gets an A-, and dessert section gets a B.    I went for dinner and it was $25.90.  If you're in the area go ahead, otherwise plan ahead, spend a little more money and most likely leave happier.  On the plus side, no stomach aches or ill effects afterwards =)",

Most of the food was stuff I could make myself and it just felt a bit more run-down and neglected than other places. If you're going to spend the money on a buffet, consider elsewhere.",

Food: I found the food to be monotonous and bland.   The exception is the Prime Rib and the fresh crab legs.  Everything else was below average.  I did not pay for the food, and I was STILL disappointed.  With taxes included, dinner for two would run you about $55.  The food is definitely not worth the price.  Service: I found the service to be mediocre as well.  They line you by party size in one of 5 lines.  From far off, it is reminiscent of a cattle-line.  Apart from this, all the other patrons are hungry as hell and rude; due in part to the size of the lines and long wait times.  Cursing, cutting, and bumping seemed to be commonplace here.  I have received better service (and food) at Golden Corral.  In short, this place had no class at all.  You will certainly leave with the B-G's (Bubble Guts).",

    "text": "Decided to have dinner here around 8:00. My general rule is that I like to try the buffet at the hotels I stay at in Vegas. The line is ridiculous. First you wait forever to pay in one line. Then  after you pay you get shuffled into another line to actually get into the buffet. There are two lines; one for groups with 1-4 people and the other for groups of 5 or more. there does not seem be any real method of deciding who gets seated next. Once I moved a little up the line bit by bit I could see inside the dining room and I was pissed when I saw a ton of empty tables some cleared off and some not yet here we stand in this line and nobody is being seated. For the length of both lines they needed to clear off those dirty tables much quicker. As far as the ones that were ready is concerned I don't know why people weren't being in them faster. I have eaten at my share of Vegas buffets and I have never experienced such a ridiculous system and wait.   I prayed that the food was worth the wait here. I needed something to justify it and unfortunately it was not worth it at all. The caramel cheesecake they had for dessert was the only thing really worth it. Some of the other desserts were good too but that was the best. They had basic buffet foods and none of it was that great. The bread was hard and the pastas were not great. The pizza and salad looked unappetizing. The meat at the carving station was disappointing. The crab legs were gross. The crab meat had a funny taste and it was tough.   Another thing that annoyed me was you don't get your own drinks. A server brings them. When I was finally seated after that wait I was out of patience and starving. They told me someone named Miguel would serve me my drink and then I can get my food so I sit and wait. Nobody shows up. Then I see him and he is essentially ignoring me. Then another server came and finally took my drink order and then she disappeared. No drink. After waiting I say screw it and go get my first plate of food. I come back and still no drink. The Miguel finally shows up and takes my drink order. I gave him my order because I assumed that lady forgot me. When he finally got to me he was quick and brought my drink right away. When I was working on my second she finally brings my drink and has the nerve to look stunned that I had another drink?! She didn't really think I would wait that long for a drink did she? Honestly after the long line to get in I did not have the patience to wait forever for a damn drink. Other buffets I have gone that don;t have self serve drinks They take the order right away and bring it to you right after. Personally though I think since a buffet you serve yourself food you should with drinks as well. One plus was they cleared your finished plates quickly. No issues with that dirty plates piling up on the table. I guess they just took a while to get tables ready after the fact but during was not a problem.   So the summation: long line to pay, another long line to get in, poor selection, poor food, long wait for drinks, good desserts, and quick clean-up. So one star for the desserts and one for the quick cleanup. The bad outweighs the good for sure and I won't be back.",

The quality of the food is not up to par as the Wynn, however, I felt that there was more of a selection of food that I PERSONALLY would eat, but like I said the quality was ok. The pastas were very good and the meat was not bad.   The dessert on the other had was amazing!!! and for sure better than the WYNN. They have 3-4 types of creme brulee!! which is my favorite and 2-3 types of cheesecakes!! soo good!!!",

But they changed out their food midway through our meal so that we were able to sample their lunch menu as well!  Score!!  The highlight of the breakfast buffet is the Omlette making station.  The sausages here were not that good.  Sushi was alright.  There was good breaded shrimp.     And holy moly their dessert station was huge.  There was a strawberry type dessert that I had two or three of.  There were mini sized dishes of any kind of dessert you can think of.  And for the traditionalists, there were also cookies and ice cream.    Lunch was about the same as breakfast... but there was a carving station with four different types of meats.  There was shrimp tempura and dim sum.    The food here was about average.  And, it was a little expensive for buffet.  Eating here, turned us off to eating at buffets the rest of the trip in Las Vegas.  It's not the restaurant's fault though.  We aren't really a buffet eating kind of crowd.",

    "text": "Came to Vegas for a work meeting and stayed at the MGM. I didn't feel adventurous so i decided to come here after reading that it was under $20 for lunch with endless mimosas.  I read wrong,  it's $22.69 for a Friday lunch and if you want endless cocktails is an extra $12.99. I missed breakfast due to an early work meeting so was hoping to get some here (i love eggs,  so breakfast is my favorite meal). I noticed that at 12:15pm  the sections looked like they would have breakfast were already closed and empty except for an omelet bar and a variety of breakfast rolls. I got one but it seemed like the omelet chef was just closing up so the choices were very limited. His child area at this point was a complete mess and the chef seemed out of it. The omelet itself was packed with cheese and a bit overcooked. Second round was Chinese with sushi.  Now I've eaten lots of Chinese food but never had orange chicken where the chicken pieces were as big as good balls, very deep fried and not very tasty.  I also got some potstickers (over cooked and bland), teriyaki beef (big juicy and rather tasty pieces), two variety of eggrolls (nothing special) and a variety of sushi (sushi section is very limited and is just California rolls types, not good at all). The Chinese food here makes Panda Express look like a five star restaurant. Next some tri tip(decent,  a bit dry and salty) buttered cooked carrots (undercooked), kiobasa sausage (very juicy and flavorful) and fried chicken (thick fried oily breading,  chicken itself was moist but KFC and/Popeyes makes better grief chicken). And lastly a variety of deserts from cookies,  a variety of rice Krispy treats,  cheesecake bites,  tarts and lots more. They have some gelatto and soft serve.  I tried about 8 different things,  to many to want to describe all of them and they all seemed like they weren't sey enough or as flavorful add they should have been.  Overall what i liked the most was the omelet and found the rest mediocre at best. They have lots of other items that i didn't try just because it didn't look appealing to me and i can only way so much. I tried add much as i could taking only a bite or two of each item (which makes me feel bad for people without food, but what are you going to do). Really wish the had some fresh shrimp and crab legs.  I wouldn't really recommend it with all the other choices around. I even enjoyed the buffet at the Orleans much better and that half the price.",

The menu does not excite me much, steak gets most attention, it is gourmet and really well done.  The guests were the worst I've ever experienced. I eat at cheap buffets, people may not have money but are nice. Here comes the scumbags, I get yelled at for simply standing at a distance checking out the steak, the line was like 8 people and fairly quick, someone thinks I am getting his steak, or criminally staring at his; not only that, I joined the line then the guy after me wanted to recommend which cut I get and then asked in disgruntled \"you don't believe me?!\" when I politely told him let me look. Even worst, the lady cutting the steak seemed like a \"steak nazi\", ignoring me for a while when I asked for a more well done piece. Not long later the line was 40 people, and I was not going back there.  Yes this was encountered during Xmas, but not a good enough reason for behaving insane and utterly rude.",

The buffet included the usually spread of different kinds of egg dishes, potatoes, and meats. For my taste, I enjoyed this buffet experience for a couple reasons. They had a salad station which included a nice and light potato salad (with purple okinawan sweet ones) and butternut squash with spinach. I thought they were a great counter balance to all the heavy dishes. Secondly, their corned beef with potatoes was made with real corned beef and not the mushy version you get from the can. It was also not greasy and not so rich tasting. The only things I wound say negative is that I didn't see any plain, white rice available and their Mexican dishes were the same kind of dishes you would get at a Station Casino buffet which costs around $6-$10. I will update this section after we try lunch and dinner here...",

You could go to a coffee shop and get a better meal for a fraction of the price.  The soup was flavorless, and the was pasta cooked to a mush. The salad was limp. The roast beef was cold and greasy, and the shrimp felt slimy and smelled FUNKY.  We ate here on a Saturday night, but for some reason several of the food stations were closed and they were running short staffed. It took forever to get a soda - which wasn't included in the price. At the salad station the only plates available were steaming hot from the dishwasher. It felt like no one in management cared about the guest's experience. Seriously, you can do better than this.",

It was totally void of crab legs, sushi, creme brulee, a carving station, and other buffet elements that I would expect in Vegas.   I expected to be wowed, but instead left way too full and temporarily satiated.   A solid spot for a meal, but by no means an outstanding Vegas buffet.",

I would never go out of my way to eat at this one but after having a long session at the craps tables the pit boss hooked me up with a free voucher. Since I was hungry I took advantage of it for dinner.  Not the largest selection of food items but it does the trick. Clean, fast service when needed, and drinks are self serve. They do have those cool soda machines where your can mix and match hundreds of flavor combos so that was a plus. Diet Fanta Grape soda for the win.  Carving station with a selection of meats, some seafood items, greens, salads, pizza, a bit of sushi, soups, dessets, etc. Nothing horrible but nothing stood out either. Compared to the better casino buffets this one is kind of bland. and surprising that in a casino of MGM's size and scope of celebrity chef restaurants they do not renovate and improve this facility to compete better. The decor too, while clean, can be brought into the current era. At $30 for dinner on a Tuesday night I was happy to get a freebie to use.  Oh well, at least I went to bed after this up a $100 with a full belly.",

We thought that was pretty sweet, since it was $71 (without tip) to eat at the buffet. We were seated and started with two mimosas (bottomless-heck yes!) and coffee. Then we hit the buffet. There were SO many choices! Even though we went during breakfast, there was still a variety of foods, including meatloaf, a salad bar, a carving station, desserts, fruit and yogurt, and a DIY omelette bar, among other things. I was impressed by the variety, but not by the food, unfortunately. A lot of it had been under the warming lights for too long, and there weren't many healthy choices available. (Tip: if you'd like to eat healthier, grab some fruit and hit up the omelette station). So that's the food. We ran into real trouble, though, when my husband went back for more mimosas. He was first sent back to the table because you can't bring the mimosa glasses back to the bar for refills, you have to leave them on your table and get new ones each time. Then, he couldn't get two at a time, because they have a one drink per person policy. That was understandable, so I went up and asked for another mimosa, and the guys carded me! I hadn't been carded the first time, and my husband didn't get carded (and neither did anyone else I saw go up, so that was a little annoying). I didn't have my ID with me, so my husband had to go up a fourth time to get me the mimosa! It was a little ridiculous, since I had already been served one. In the grand scheme of things, it wasn't a huge deal, but it was enough of an annoyance on top of the not so great food to give me a pretty negative impression of the restaurant. I won't be going back, not for that price!",

I would've gotten my money's worth if I drank, but I don't, so my view may be a little skewed based on this. I really enjoyed the butcher and seafood stations, because I'm a huge fan of both meat and seafood. The dessert table was pretty tasty (fun shortcakes, cupcakes, cookies, etc). There was also seasonal ice cream flavors like lychee and island coffee. The rest of the food tables were pretty lackluster and nothing to write home about. Service was efficient. It was convenient to where I was staying but probably would not visit again.",

It's a long boring story of why we ate here today vs going to one of numerous amazing Buffets in Vegas such as Bacchanal or the Wynn! We regretted our choice. Definitely skip this place unless your on a tight budget and want to drink lots of alcohol. They include all you can drink alcohol on certain days. I do want to mention that we had great service and the employees were hard working and very nice. MGM really needs to improve the food here. Sad. Or if they don't want to invest in a good Buffett then they should just closer down.",

They had a great selection of food for the price, which is low compared to other buffets inside major hotels in the area. Also, since we got there at 2:50pm we got charged the lower lunch price, but got to enjoy all the pricier dinner items that come out at 3pm. They had king crab legs, which my husband loves. Also all kinds of Chinese, Mexican, American, and seafood favorites, as well as lamb meat. There is all-you-can drink beer and wine included with the price as well, which was perfect for our toast.",

But the options were minimal for a Buffett and the quality of the food was terrible, Especially the desserts. They were just tasteless.  Only 2 rows of food options and only tiny shrimp and no crab legs. We went on a Thursday night though for dinner so perhaps that is why. I was just Really surprised and disappointed with the overall experience. I've been to most buffets here in Vegas  and had never been to the MGM. I will not go again. Nothing compares to the Wynn buffet!  I will remind myself of that the next time I'm here in Vegas.",

    "text": "The Buffet at MGM is one of my new favorites. It has a lot of the same food buffet has at Caesars but it's not as pricey. Caesar's has the fresh juice and the crepes made to order but if you don't care about those items I think the food is similar.  If you are a local there is a locals discount during the week which is about $30.00 a person . The good news about going during the week is they still serve crab legs during dinner and it isn't as crowded as the weekend.   I liked the fact that during dinner you not only get the crab legs but they can make you Pan Roast (seafood cooked in a red broth served with rice) to order. They only sprinkle a little rice in it but you can add more white rice it is near the Pho. Yes there is also Pho (Vietnamese soup) for those who love soup like I do especially in this chilly weather. The Pan Roast had a nice kick to it and it was super tasty but I think it could do without this pink and white seafood block they put in it though.  They also have a Cajun type of stew with corn ,sausage , shrimp that is pretty good too. Dinner and brunch both have creative salads to choose from. My favorites contained plenty of mimosas , beets and grapefruit.  If you are there during brunch do me a favor and get a couple of little plates of the baby clams in the garlic sauce it is to die for!! Trust me!",

Quick tip:  Skip the rolls and head to the crab claws!  Sushi, crab claws, and amazing desserts was the majority of what piled on to my plate when I ate here.  Whether you want Mexican food, seafood, Italian, or Chinese food this is a great place to get a diverse selection of food.  This is espceially helpful if you are traveling in a group (whether it's friends or family) and no one can decide on a place to go eat at.  Why choose one type of food when you can have a variety. After all isn't that what buffets are for? Plus this is a buffet in Vegas. Let me repeat:  all you can eat crab claws.  Oh yes.  Don't worry about having to fret about what dessert to get, too.  Most of the desserts I saw were tiny, so you can have a bite of this and a bite of that, before you know it you've tried six different desserts, all of them just a bite full!  This is a great way to indulge without paying the price later with a sugar crash.",

    "text": "This really is an average place with OK food - nothing bad, nothing great - and you don't pay too much for it. Since we stayed at MGM Grand Hotel we went to this buffet on a number of occasions and got a pretty good idea of the place.  I can't understand people who say the buffet is overpriced. What are you comparing it to - some local all you can eat buffet in Alabama? Compared to the other Vegas strip hotel buffets MGM is on the cheaper side. For example they're asking $36 for dinner, while Wicked Spoon (Cosmopolitan) charges $50 and Bacchanal (Caesar's) charges $60 for dinner. That's a huge difference when you're a party of 4 or more.  The great thing about MGM is that there's no long wait. For example Bacchanal had a 5 hour waiting list on the 24th and shortest line this week that we saw was about 1,5 hours. I'm really not prepared to wait that long in line to eat, no matter how good the food is. The same long line story goes for most of the buffets on the strip. In MGM the longest we waited was for 15 minutes and that's a great perk when you're hungry!  The service is really uneven. The first time we got this great waiter who kept bringing us champagne until we were quite tipsy before 12 pm. But usually the staff had so much to do and run around that we really didn't get good service. It seems they're understaffed.  All in all if you're hungry on the Strip, don't want to wait for a long time, don't want to pay too much and you're not far away then this place satisfies your needs.",

I even purchased a mamosa drink from the kiosk that said 'unlimited mamosa' . . the waitress told me that she didn't want to go to the other side of the room to get it.  I am not kidding.  Needless to say I didn't tip her for bringing me a water instead.  Most of the food was weird (noodle & egg soups . . . weird stuff in the pastas.)  The ham / roast beef / & turkey station was edible but not great.  The rest sucked.  Oh' and the hand made omelets are good in the morning (but that is it).

The taco shells were stale so I opted to eat only the taco ingredients (ground beef, shredded lettuce, guacamole, sour cream, cheese). The BBQ pork ribs weren't tender. The macaroni & cheese was too rich. It was almost as if Kraft singles were put on top, melted, stirred around, then served.   My stomach started hurting after my 2nd plate, which had the mac & cheese, taco (with a stale taco shell), and meat lasagna. Ended up with diarrhea during the drive home.  Never again. I kinda wish we went to the buffet at the M like I had originally wanted. Next time.",

The brunch food was okay, not a ton of selection for a vegetarian who is allergic to nuts though, since a lot of foods involved pesto. I did enjoy their homefries though, they were very tasty, and they also had some very yummy coffee cake. The deserts overall were tasty. My boyfriend thought the food was okay, but would have liked to see a bit more selection. Our server was extremely nice and kept our drinks refilled.",

There is a wide variety of mediocre food. I will eat almost anything without complaining, but this food was terrible. A lot of it even looked unappetizing, but out of all the things I tried, I wasn't that impressed. Only the chocolate pecan dessert at the end was enjoyable, but not for $70. Overall, they have a couple of good things, but it's just not worth it. If you want to pay a lot of money, there are plenty of other restaurants in the MGM Grand and Las Vegas.",

NOT GOOD.   overall, it's not horrible... i actually really liked it here. the service is wonderful and if you're with good company... i don't see why it would be that average. too bad i was nursing a hang over to really enjoy anything else.",

The line moved quickly, the wait staff and hosts are very polite, friendly and accommodating. Drink's are refilled constantly, and the array of food was astounding. The sushi was delicious and fresh with many varieties of maki to choose from. They have a taco bar, a pasta bar, a seafood section, a decadent dessert section... you name it! Very busy and always a full house, but plenty of room to maneuver. Everyone on here is complaining about the price but COME ON! Its Vegas for one, and its the MGM! They can charge whatever they please, they are one of the best, well-known casinos on the strip! I actually thought it was quite decently priced at $24 bucks a person. All you can eat... $24 bucks ain't bad!",

My friend and I enjoyed this buffet so much that we went for the brunch a few times and dinner buffet once, during the week of NYE. We got the unlimited champagne and I would highly recommend paying the extra $8 for it. Our server Ruth was the greatest and we requested her two more times that we went. I miss her already! The prime rib was juicy and tender and flavorful, and they had the BEST tortilla chips and pico de gallo with just enough of a spicy kick to it. I could have that particular bar placed in my house and be extremely content. They had pretty much everything you could possibly want and I was happy with the quality. (Sushi was only available during dinner buffets which was a bit of a bummer, but if you want sushi, see my review for Sushi House Goyemon.) I will agree their country fried chicken is very tasty and tender, and chicken is not something I normally want when I eat out. Desserts were generally okay. I'm not much of a dessert person but I must say, they had this little triangular chocolate pecan tart which was so good that I smuggled extras in my bag for later :-O Try one, and have a second for me! They had it every time I went, so I think it is one of their regular desserts. You can even make your own soft serve ice cream cones with toppings at this buffet which is fun.   I wish I could eat here every day, alas, I am in Bermuda and won't see this buffet for a long time. I want to cry now!!",

I had two plates of hummus with rock hard pita bread and was done. Nothing was remotely appealing, other than the exit.   I complained to the manager who agreed to credit the price of the buffet to my room. This never happened. Another manager then agreed to take care of it, but has failed to do so.   What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, right?  Well  this buffet is SO BAD that I'm breaking the rules. Do youself a huge favor by hiking a few blocks down to the Bellagio or the Wynn.

It was especially disappointing because even though my visit was free, I would have preferred to totally skip this buffet because it honestly wasn't very good nor was it worth the exorbitant price. It reminded me of a Golden Corral/low end chain restaurant, and definitely not a Las Vegas resort/casino buffet.  The good: The desserts were good. Decent coffee too. Sides like mac & cheese were okay. Chicken tika masala was okay too. Decent flavor profiles to choose from but it was like 85% \"American food\".  The bad: Almost everything fell short of my already low expectations. The hot crab legs were laughably small, overcooked and fishy. The dude serving up the crab legs seemed like he hated his job and was extremely rude to customers that didnt tip him. They were out of crab crackers and didn't even have wet wipes or cloth napkins available to clean off your hands after hand picking the crab. Most of the steam trays were either empty or filled with food that wasn't fresh. There seemed to be a ton of sloppy, visually unappealing food.  I left feeling disappointed and smelling like rotten seafood. I pretty much ate cookies for dinner. I will definitely not be returning.",

Come on MGM Grand, you can do better!!",

Unfortunately the overall rating here is right on.   Have you ever been to Golden Corral buffet? Well, GC is better than this buffet. BY FAR. Not only was the price for what you get, totally shit, it lacked amounts of offerings. Three dinky rows during dinner? Not worth it. They offer the buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner. We tried it for dinner on the first night and said nope, not coming here again. The prices on their website also are incorrect. It is $33 for the dinner buffet, and extra for any drink at all. I assume they fluctuate their pricing based on busy times.  The best part was the dessert offerings. Save your $$ for gambling and just eat elsewhere.",

I tried a little bit of everything, I really wish that they had more variety of food. I tried the mac and cheese and it was beyond bland, the shrimp cocktail was decent. Love the fact that the crab legs was already cut. I loved the garlic bread and I like the pizza,The chip and guacamole was pretty good, The meatball tasted like frozen meatballs. I love the salad bar as it gave you a bunch of different toppings.... The dessert bar was okay it's just that everything tasted stale.",

    "text": "\"Meh. I've experienced better.\" pretty much sums up MGM Grand Buffet.  My dinner was comped so I didn't have to pay but had I paid, I would have been pretty upset.  Outside of crab legs and maybe shrimp cocktail, the buffet didn't offer anything that I could consider 'premium.'  The seafood was limited and their food was mediocre, at best.  After my initial first round, I didn't find anything that I particularly wanted to go back to get seconds.  I would highly suggest avoiding the sushi as the rolls were most likely previously frozen and not fresh.  They have a station where you can customize your seafood dish and I didn't like the fact that they served swordfish because 1) They're not very good and 2) It's not good for the ecosystem.  I found that most people end up getting swordfish because the only other fish that he can cook is tilapia and that's a cheap & dirty fish.    Overall, a very disappointing experience.  I don't remember MGM Grand Buffet being this bad but it looks like since no one goes to this buffet anymore (i.e. little to no line), they've also downgraded on the quality of what they serve.",

The reason why is because the quality has gone down and down.  They have taken out some of my favorite stations including meat kabobs and mashed potato bar.  There is no more vegetable lasagna.  No more mac and cheese. No more coconut shrimp. The desserts are tasteless.  But the biggest reason why I pay top dollar for buffets are the crab legs.  Well MGM no longer has hot crab legs and YOU CAN'T GET YOUR OWN CRAB LEGS!  An attendant doles out the crab legs like a soup line during the depression. I had to practically beg for extra because I did not want to wait in line again to get more.  Very disappointing.   On the plus the service is always top notch.  There was not a long line when we went.  The prime rib was tender, the Mongolian beef was excellent, the Italian soup was tasty, the fruit was fresh, and the garlic mashed potatoes were good.",

Meanwhile back in the line...we stood there as everyone else that was in the line we were in before she summoned us to switch...got seated and served..even people that came in behind us got in before we did.  We finally made it to the buffet and there was nothing really \"grand\" about it.  The food was fine..standard buffet selection...One thing I did notice is the crab legs were being \" guarded\" by an asian lady that acted like she had paid for them out of her own pocket.  You can't serve yourself crab legs..you have to ask for them...and she would only give you 2 small crab legs at a time and was not even friendly.   The place was clean and its not a bad buffett.....if your looking for something better..go to the Bellagio...for about ten bucks more you get a much better quality of food.",

Definitely not a bad deal at all.    The buffet is ok, but really  nothing to write home about.     We got there right as breakfast was ending, so I won't blame them for running out of several things.    Breakfast selection looked pretty standard (breakfast meats, pastries, omlet station, etc).   There were also a few entrees and some desserts out, but I'm not sure if those were already being put out for lunch, or if they had them out during breakfast as well.   The blueberry pancake was amazing (not standard individual pancakes, more of a bluberry pancake batter baked into a dish and scooped out with a spoon).    Lunch was decent...there was nothing in particular that stood out, although the desserts were pretty good (loved the chocolate tart).    Similarly, dinner was reasonably good but there was nothing that was particularly amazing or stood out.  The roast beef at the carving station was probably my favorite.   Many of the same entrees and desserts were repated at lunch and dinner, which is probably to be expected but was a bit of a bummer, since we were hoping for a little more variety.",

    "text": "MGM Grand's Breakfast buffet was edible.  It was fair priced ($14.99) for Vegas, BUT the food selection and quality was more like breakfast buffets at standard run-of-the-mill hotels.  One of the biggest turn-offs was a roast beef they served on the carving station.  Absolutely the worst slice of roast beef I've had in my life.  I should've known by looking at the roast while she carved it, that it would be OVERCOOKED, DRY, TOUGH and FLAVORLESS.  It was very much like beef jerky without flavor.  And what made it worse was no gravy or au jus to cover up the cardboardiness.  The ham she carved for me was just ok.  No pancakes.  Aren't pancakes one of the staples of a basic breakfast?  The hot chocolate machine was good.  The norwegian style salmon with capers and onions was good.  Go elsewhere if you have time.  The only way I would eat MGM's breakfast buffet again is if the price were dropped to about $10 (drink included) a person.  Then I may eat it once out of a 7 day vacation.  Definitely not as good as the breakfast buffet at Paris Las Vegas.",

Buckets of barely edible food.  selection poor. quality poor, taste poor and unappetizing. The only things that was good was the coffee. I am never returning. Even worse, the price was $33.",

So first pro tip for you if you're claiming a free buffet from playing the my vegas game... don't wait till right before going to the breakfast buffet to head to that Mlife desk.  Odds are there will be a line.   So do it earlier than later so you don't miss your meal or have too little time to enjoy the buffet.   Now we're at the breakfast buffet, if you're at the cuff between breakfast and lunch time you're lucky and get some lunch items! The selection is decent, you got your bacon, eggs, omelets, sausages oh andddd plentiful desserts! Drinks are self serve in the morning.   All in all because I got the breakfast buffet for free, I was content and I'd also be okay with paying $18 for breakfast here as it did have a decent selection... I'll be back MGM",

    "text": "Not sure what all the bad reviews are about - we came here on a weeknight for dinner - $32/person with all you can drink beer and wine? I don't know Vegas too well but that sounds like a perfectly reasonable price to me. I've only been to one other dinner buffet with all-you-can-drink alcohol (I think it was Bally's or maybe it was Harrah's?) and this blows that one out of the water.  So what did I have? Mashed potatoes, meatloaf, dumplings, antipasto/charcuterie, mussels, sausage, prime rib, crab legs were all pretty good. Fried chicken seemed to have been sitting out for a while but it was still crispy and moist enough. The brussel sprouts were a little undercooked and hard, and the sushi was kinda dry but i pretty much come to expect that from buffets. Desserts were fine (my favorite was something called a Honey Bar), I like that there's a Coke freestyle machine, and even though the beer selection is limited to Bud Light, Coors Light (I think) and a house red and a house white wine, you can still easily get your money's worth (and you can add on a $15 surcharge if you want more unlimited alcohol like mixed drinks).  Overall it was a totally above-average buffet experience - nothing was offensively bad, but nothing blew my mind. It was basically a Golden Corral with alcohol, which may sound like a diss but I mean it as a complement - you'd be hard-pressed to find a better deal in Vegas.",

The sirloin and brisket was so over cooked and dry I could barely swallow it. Even the fruit was disappointing. The selections were watermelon, cantaloupe and honey dew. Not ripe, not sweet. I had a hard time understanding why they couldn't get that one right.   The mimosas and desserts were good so we binged in those. Even at a fair price I would never go there again.

Also the salad bar selection was pretty small, not a whole lot of vegetables or dressings to choose from. I REALLY missed balsamic vinaigrette... that wasn't an option.   I still managed to eat a decent meal (thank goodness for the Asian foods section) and my boyfriend enjoyed the buffet since he has no dairy issues. I probably wouldn't come back though. For the price, I just didn't feel like I got a whole lot of value or variety due to my dairy issues, which is why you come to a buffet.",

I may go at dinner since its convenient and the line wasn't too long. I'm hoping for variety!",

Went to omelet station and there was one person there who's omelet was being prepared. Preparer was engaged in conversation and chose to ignore my self and the 2 people who joined the line behind me. I just gave up and walked away, and as I was in another line, I looked over and the woman behind me walked away as well. Same thing happened on last visit, could this be the same guying ignoring the line?           Bad Attitude, just ignoring customers like that.",

If there is anything good I can say about this place it's that they did have a big variety to choose from. From pizza to Crab legs you will likely find whatever your craving here.",

MGM Champagne Brunch 3. Pampas Brazilian BBQ (Miracle Mile) 4. Monte Carlo Dinner  5. Quad's Brunch   Service was crap.  The food was alright - as a vegetarian I had some novel options but wasn't really excited about anything.   I'm not sure the champagne is worth it - you'd think it's \"all you can drink\"  but it's more like \"all the inattentive server decides to bring you\" and that's probably not worth it.   With a great server that would be an awesome deal though... I didn't even get a buzz and i'm a light weight drinker.   The highlight of the buffet is the gelato... I guess that's not the biggest complement because they just served that stuff up but I really enjoyed that covered in baby m&ms.",

For desserts, I made myself an apple crips with some vanilla ice-cream. The apple crisp tasted like an empty mush with a hint of cinnamon. If it wasn't for the dash of vanilla ice-cream (only a dash because the machine was empty) I probably would have let the whole thing go to waste. So I ate the ice-cream and trashed the rest.",

I did it one morning and got 2 bloody Mary's and a memosa. They were pretty weak so unless you really want a lot of drinks with your meal it's probably not worth it. I wouldn't have paid the price to eat here if it wasn't for the meal credits which is really the only reason I deducted a star.

Same goes for their dessert selection. There were a lot of varieties and they all looked really good, but none of them stood out and there wasn't a single dessert i finished...  Service was top notch though, so no complaints there. Think is was the only thing enjoyable about the restaurant. They have a really nice staff there, but the food quality definitely needs a lot of improvement, especially for the price you are paying to eat there.",

The food was horribly bland, the service was sup-par bordering on non-existent, the ONLY item worth coming here for was the prime rib, everything else had absolutely no flavor, or was complete mush from (what it seemed like) sitting all day. We have eaten at RIO, Mirage, Luxor and Monte Carlo Buffet, all of which were WAY better than here. We will never be back, save your money and eat somewhere else.",

Otherwise you're just being dumb.   You'll pay a lot (its vegas), next to a noisy casino floor (its vegas), with staff who could care less about you (its vegas), but it'll be massively overindulgent (its vegas). Steak is nice and juicy, crab legs are not, the other buffet staples (pasta, chow mein, fruit, etc.) are below average and disappointing because the MGM is a veritable mega-opolis on the Strip. After paying a visit to Hakassan or the casino floor all you really want to do is binge at a bomb buffet, but the MGM one just doesn't cut it. Not a disaster by any means, so not 1-star worthy, but if you're on the Strip you have options and so this shouldn't make the cut.",

I beg to differ. People at my table had prime rib and said it was overcooked. Their sushi section had an okay selection. Stay away from their philly role, teriyaki roll was plain, and tuna roll was great. Their Chinese food section could have been better. I did enjoy their egg rolls though. My husband complimented on their pizza in the Italian section. I enjoyed their dessert a lot right up until I had the pistachio pudding (super plain). I love their red velvet cake.   Customer service was definitely a miss. Waitress was not great to us and stayed the same throughout the night. The only thing she got right was our drinks and even got milk when we requested it. Other than that, she wasn't that friendly and appeared as if we were taking a lot of her time. Although the waitress wasn't so great, the people that greeted us was nice, friendly and understanding.   All in all, I don't think I'll make a second trip here.",

    "text": "Being from Portland I cannot believe I went into a \"buffet\" place. That is one thing Portland does not do, and if they do do buffets they are horrid little places.  I guess Las Vegas is the opposite because this place had some pretty decent food and the price was fantastic for the location as well.  We only ate there when we got out of bed for two mornings so I can only talk breakfast. However, there was lunch out there as well.  Tons of food, all tasted fresh, and they always had it full and plenty hot enough.  My inlaws back in the day, used to make us go with them to a Portland buffet and they would have the nastiest food in those big square containers with the boiled water underneath. The food would be crusty around the sides and be overcooked and pretty much canned. The desserts would be things like puddings that had a layer of hardened pudding on the top and you would have cool whip to put over it. There would be the fruit cocktail with the cherries on top and the dried up pizza.. Like I said, Portland does not do buffets.  I digress, but I was making a point, sort of a contrast from what I saw here. First, none of those square containers with the boiled water below like a cafeteria was anywhere to be seen.  Their presentation was appetizing instead, and the items were things like: smoked salmon, smoked trout, homemade crepes made on the spot with any fruit you wanted them to make for you, root veggies, apricot, prune, mango fruit salad, all kinds of olives, lots of egg choices, and even homemade grits.   The servers were friendly and helpful as well.  The price for breakfast all you can eat was a good deal, especially since we just did not eat lunch after that meal anyway!  And Las Vegas charges so much for meals!  I think Portland could learn a thing or two from the buffet here. There's a niche in this market that's waiting to happen. I mean it's kind of like a brunch and we do that quite well.",

Food options reminds me of a step above Hometown Buffet. It's just not that good. I walked around the place four times trying to find out what I could eat but their options were minimal. Horrible Asian options. Meat carving was decent. Meat loaf and mashed potatoes were bland. Dessert options were not bad. I liked their pistachio gelato. Regular price would be $20.99. Totally not worth it. Glad this meal is free because of a complimentary deal I had when I did my hotel reservations.  I would not bother returning here.",

Have been to this buffet a couple times now....the first experience I think was a touch better, it seems the food has declined over the last few years.  What I don't like is the layout. Condiments are spread out in various locations and hard to find. Mexican type food seemed to be in two different places. Bowls for soup not near soup? Make your own salad and pre-made salads in two different locations. It was just odd.  They do have it all though. Some fresh crab and cold seafood options, comfort foods, Mexican, Asian, cuts of meat...it was all pretty OK, fairly average. Fried chicken was a touch dry, mashed potatoes could have used more flavoring. Sushi I would avoid. Lots of tasty items though like the cajun fried fish, prime rib, etc.  I would recommend for the price, but if you're looking for something AMAZING you are better off at Caesars, Bellagio, or something of the like.",

The server was actually much more attentive than some other buffets on the blvd.   So I guess I understand the low ratings.

The food selection was horrible. The salad bar was a joke. There wasn't even one chocolate dessert for the kids. Not to mention it was 30.00 for the adults and a 5 yr old was 20.00! There wasn't even chicken for her to eat,  so it cost me 20.00 for an ice cream cone because there was seriously such a terrible selection of food!! I ate maybe 5.00 worth myself! Horrible just horrible!! Home Town Buffet looked like a high class buffet compared to this garbage! I would NEVER EVER go here nor recommend this place!!  EVER!!! Biggest waste of 120.00 I have ever spent!  I would have expected much more from the MGM. Soooo terribly disappointed!!",

Once we were seated everything went well our waiter (wish I would of got his name) was very nice and made sure our cups were always full and made sure to always pick up our dirty plates. They had a very large variety of food everything from sushi to Mexican food and everything was freshly made. I wish their dessert area had more of a variety everything was also bite size but overall it was pretty good. As far as the price goes am not to sure because we scored free vouchers but I believe it was  $15 for kids 4-12 and $19.99 for adults drinks included. We went during lunch time I think the price goes up if you go during dinner time :)",

And I'm pretty happy with just Panda Express so it's hard to not please me with Chinese food but the asian fare they had was so terrible I took one nibble and pushed my plate away. The italian fare was slightly better but still only TV dinner quality. (Shows how bad the other stuff was) They made Golden Corral feel like a fancy buffet. I thought Vegas was supposed to be famous for its buffets but apparently not so at the MGM Grand. What a waste of money. Seriously, do not go here for dinner.",

You don't get as much selection, but there's all the regular mainstays: alaskan crab leg and prime rib, a good choice of desserts. Then, you can deal with the lackluster sushi. Who cares? I'll take the prime rib.",

    "text": "I had received a comp for a brunch buffet at MGM Grand Buffet so decided to go there during my January 2018 Las Vegas trip.  Even though I've been going to Las Vegas annually at least once for the past 9 years or so, this was the first time that I was eating at the MGM Grand Buffet (but I have eaten at other Las Vegas MGM Resort owned buffets before including the buffets at Excalibur, Monte Carlo, Bellagio, and the Mirage).  In the past, when in that area of the Strip, I would normally eat at Monte Carlo's buffet but now with the renovations and Monte Carlo being \"dismantled\" and changing the name to Park, Monte Carlo's buffet was closed. I ate a few times at Excalibur's buffet but for some reason, I preferred Monte Carlo's buffet.  On the day that I went, there wasn't much of a line to get in. After going thru the cash, the lady handling the seating asked me if it was the first time I was here. I mentioned that it was. As she led me to my table, she pointed to where the self service soda drink machines were and mentioned that I could help myself.  The buffet is somewhat similar to what Monte Carlo's buffet used to have but MGM's buffet has a bit more variety. The self serve soda machine is also better at the MGM Buffet (similar to the self serve soda machines offered at the Mirage's Craving Buffet) than it was at Monte Carlo's buffet. While not as much variety and/or the quality was not the same as such places as Caesars Palace Bacchanal Buffet (variety and quality), Bally's Sterling Brunch buffet (quality), or Bellagio's buffet (variety and quality), I still enjoyed MGM's buffet (and I do like it over Excalibur's buffet). From my recollection based on the last time I was at the Mirage's Craving Buffet, I think that MGM's buffet is somewhat on par with it (at least for brunch).  There is free WiFi in the buffet area for restaurant guests. I had data on my smartphone so I didn't use it that much but it did seem reliable. The only thing is that you need to sign in with an e-mail address.  If I wasn't comped for the buffet and I wanted to have a buffet in that area of the Strip, I would return, now that Monte Carlo's buffet is closed and I'm not too crazy about the buffet at Excalibur for some reason.  I would give them a 3.5 star review which I've rounded up to 4 star.",

Not to mention of course the fantastic desserts which were my favorite part. Everything that I ate was good to great. I'm not comparing it to a five-star restaurant or a McD, only what I expect buffet food should taste like. Your results may vary, since different people have different tastes, and they compare food to what they know. Great service all the way around and would most certainly eat here again  The MGM Grand buffet has earned it to stars Chicken fried steak with gravy. Average Eggs Benedict. Terrible Chicken Cordon Bleu. Awful The wait was long, and when you get inside they have a lot of on bus tables, so they need more people to bus tables so people don't have to wait in line forever. I do have to say the staff inside the restaurant was excellent",

But I gave MGM the benefit of the doubt just because of the mini-bar inside the buffet.  This buffet is pricey if you add on the alcohol but the selection of booze is better than other resorts that offer alcohol included with their buffet. It includes champagne, mimosas, strawberry and traditional margaritas, house wine, draft beer, bloody marys, screwdrivers, tequila sunrise, whiskey sour, strawberry daiquiri, and peach bellini. The pricing for the bar is also confusing depending on when you arrive. They have a weekday brunch here and I believe that champagne and mimosas are already included. All the other alcohol is when the price goes up.   As far as the buffet itself goes, I came here for the weekday brunch. The variety was average. They had the usual brunch items: sausage, scrambled eggs, bacon, and oatmeal. Lunch items included lasagna, french onion soup, taquitos, fried chicken, prime rib, turkey, and ham.",

We went on a Saturday night which was about $40-42 a person for seafood and prime rib night. Prime rib was pretty standard but the crab legs were great. Line moved quickly and you can get crab legs steamed or ask the chef to saute them in garlic and other spices.  I do like how you have to line up to get your portion of crab legs from the chef. I've been to other buffets where they simply just put out the crab legs on the buffet line for everyone and one or two people end up taking it all lol. Other seafood I tried were the oysters, shrimp cocktail and shrimp tempura. All good and fresh. Dinner also came with AYCE beer and wine in which you had to walk and order from the bar yourself and they do limit you to only ordering 1 drink at a time.   Soda/tea/juice/water are self serve for customers and the staff kept our plates clear throughout dinner  Overall,  good experience and will definitely recommend if someone is looking for crab legs",

The weekend dinner includes beer and wine (I just got the red wine so I didn't note how much variety) but there wasn't any wait to get to the bar or for food (which can be hugely distracting when hungry).  Best parts were the carving station for prime rib and to get the crab legs, which people were way over piling. There was a little wait for those items, but they also had a good variety of other foods including sushi. They also had a bunch of different tiny desserts so you don't have to feel so bad about getting several.  I didn't try the higher end buffets, but it was hard to justify the price for those. I found this to be a good variety of foods including fancier foods, $40 for a dinner is a bit high, but I think it's worth a try.",

We had a $100 dining credit as part of our deal with our hotel stay that we'd forgotten about until that morning so we came here to spend as much of it as we could. We came close - the buffet plus drinks came to around $75. We were seated right away and promptly went to the bar to order drinks. My wife ordered all you can drink mimosas and Champaign. I ordered the slightly more expensive all you can drink option that included more options like mixes drinks and draft beer. I thought the all you can drink options were a good value for Vegas. We both got a refill right before leaving and walked out into the casino with full drinks.   The food was fairly typical for a casino buffet. I got a sampling of way too many things and left a little over filled :). The fried chicken was a little dry but that's common at buffets. The beef brisket was quite good however leading me to sampling more of it.   The service was fine but servers only take used plates away so the quality of service is not as important.   I'd probably come back but if we didn't have the dining credit I think $75 was a little pricey for what we got, but overall good experience.",

The selections are so limited I mean like one bowl of frozen shrimp cocktail watery. I'm not asking for snow crab, lobster or anything like that just simple shrimp.  They had fried shrimp so dry it scraped the roof of my mouth, then I saw some trout fillet... ok that might help me avoid some meat. No no no...it was overpowered with salt. Only two types of vegetable rolls dry and no flavor, even the salad doesn't have a good selection. The desert is another disappointment.   If your charging $32.99 per Buffett you are obligated to provide some decent food out there for your guests.

    "text": "I've been here many time in my Vegas lifetime. I've seen this place evolve through the good and the bad. Currently, the food here is good to above average for breakfast. For breakfast, they have fresh blueberries, salmon lox, different bread, omelet station, carved station (only sausage and one other meat) and your usual offerings including cereal.  However, I did find something new here, Deep Fried Twinkies and these Mango Puffs. The mango puffs were not good, not crispy. However the fried twinkies were pretty awesome. They were pretty popular and of course, were always out but I got a few and worth trying.   What I don't like here is that they now have self serve juice/coffee/tea/milk station. It started late last year and the waitresses have to do more work.  You might think they are just there to clear dishes but they actually laid off a lot of folks as a result.   If you are a heavy drinker, add the $16 AYCD wrist band for the bar there. Lots of frat boys were there having a great time, 5 fiving each other. Well, I guess if I was younger and was about the hit the pool, I would've done this too.   $18 for breakfast. Kids are $12.  What's a pain here is if you have M Life, you have to go to the desk and they don't open before 8am. Kids are not welcomed there and the buffet is way in the back by the sports book.  Even with all of these problems, breakfast is worth it if you don't go out of your way and if you have some kind of discount.",

    "text": "After going to the Wynn buffet on my last trip, this one was extremely disappointing.    It's like The Wynn was Saks 5th Ave or Nordstrom's and the MGM was Kmart. Yes the Kmart of buffets- that pretty much sums it up.  The decor - like most of the patrons is tired and worn out.   The food itself is lower grade then expected. A lot if it is dried out, greasy, overly salty or on the other side of the spectrum- tasteless.   If you go just before the lunch cut off, you will get some of the dinner items ( crab legs, shrimp, mussels ) these too were all sub par.  The desert section was a bit better - the  cheesecake shots  were ok ....the cookies were way too sweet.   Anyway/ I won't be back - nor do I reccomend. Go else where!",

Got to try their brunch, a long with their Dinner as well. My friends enjoyed it. No complaints from us. The chef who was managing the hot grill making the shrimp, chicken, and steak plates was on point. He was very friendly and a pro at what he was doing. I didn't get his name but I do remember his name tag had \"El Salvador\" on it. Props to him! I hope the MGM Buffet management acknowledge his work.   The buffet is pricey, but will I bet back? Yes, I would! Would be even better if they'd comp a buffet for me hehe. But I definitely will be back.  *Quick-Tip:  - Make sure to come in advance. It does get packed.   If anything were to change, I will be updating my review.  Thanks MGM Buffet!",

The selection was spectacular. Indian, Japanese, American, Italian, and more were represented. Perhaps I'm overly critical, but most dishes had just mediocre taste. A few standouts deserve mention. The carved meats were all very good: brisket, roast beef, ham, turkey, chicken and more.",

    "text": "On a weekend they charge $43 for adults and for kids 5 and up, they charge $23. I just visited Aria (also MGM) and they give free kids. Why not MGM?!??? I already knew that it was going to be crap food because of the reviews but I needed to use the resort credit that we got since we check out tomorrow. So the buffet is immensely dated. More fitting for the Circus Circus buffet. The crab is served by a lady that just grabs a bunch and places on a plate for us. Had this buffet let us just grab our own, there wouldn't be so many crap pieces and pieces I don't normally eat on my plate. She dropped her tongs on the floor and used the \"multipurpose wipes\" to clean them. Last I checked those are bleach wipes right? I don't think that is meant to be used on eating utensils! The buffet has a self serve DRINK station. For $43!!!! Have you ever seen such ridiculousness??? There wasn't much culinary amazingness here or anything that I would EVER pay this much for. Had I had to pay full price, I would've chose any of the other  competitors. How does a world class hotel that attracts celebrities from all over the world, serve such crap? Obviously celebs don't eat buffets but the crowds that come to see them do!!! Why not invest in the buffet and revamp...bring in world class chefs. Make it desirable!!! It's really embarrassing. I really did feel like I was at Sizzlers or Hometown buffet but 4x the price. The desserts were a joke. Any buffet serving soft serve yogurt who charges $50 a head is a joke in my eyes. They obviously just bank on their guests that don't feel like walking to eat or can't get reservations at their ultra fancy restaurants. Will not ever visit again. Will use credit on room service or something else next time!",

I also didnt realize this until the Best Lady said something after dinner but I reserved for an area and they literally closed that whole area off for us, it was really nice of them!  The food itself wasnt what I remembered. They only served chilled crab legs (last time I went was for Easter a few years back, maybe that's why they had more that day) which were good but I wanted warm crab legs too! Their Chicken Parm was DELICIOUS. I also heard the tacos were delicious. I didnt get a chance to try much food but the things I did have were really really good.

The food selection is boring and clearly not fresh.  The salad bar items have clearly been sitting in their containers around the ice too long, they were bad, and the fixings for the salad were too limited.  The carvery was decent but that was the only hot food that was. Finally, the service was friendly but very slow, especially considering it wasn't busy, our glasses sat empty.",

    "text": "You're going leave feeling full but that doesn't necessarily mean the food is that great. To break it down, I'll explain why I gave this buffet 2 stars. The first star was for the selection and variety of food, from Sea Food to Mexican food to yummy deserts. The second star was for the service. Our waiter was very attentive and helpful. Here is why I don't particularly care for this buffet: This place was WAY overpriced. $30 per person for dinner. That price would be acceptable had the food been fresh, warm, tasty, and cooked well. The coffee was awful. It tasted like mildew.  The Only good food item I ate was the caramel cheesecake. The Cesar salad was tasteless and nearly dry. The lasagna was dry as well. It tasted like a freezer burn lasagna that you pull out to eat for dinner as a last resort.  The mashed potatoes were good, but how hard is it to make good mashed potatoes?? The shrimp was pretty fresh and clean as well. One of the biggest upsets was the fried chicken; just gross.  All in all, I would Not recommend eating here and we won't be returning. Bummer!",

One minor nitpick I have is that even though I'm glad they leave the utensils behind, they tend to place the utensils on the table, which I personally like to avoid since I usually put them on napkins. It would be nice if they offered replacement utensils other than just the ones on the table, although I guess maybe it's like that so that too much water isn't wasted.  There were a large variety of food dishes to choose from. They make the price of $40/person a good deal by offering a lot of expensive dishes. There were crab legs, lobster ravioli, prime rib, and creme brulee. They also offered complimentary drinks like raspberry iced tea and sodas.",

    "text": "Came here on a Tuesday after I arrived for work with a few coworkers.  No lines, which was nice, so we were seated right away.  On that night, they had their standard items, and many stations actually were closed which was disappointing.  They have your usual: carving station, salad bar, seafood, cold dishes, Asian, Italian, Mexican etc.  The carving station had prime rib, roasted turkey, and Polish sausage, which wasn't bad since all were done fairly well.  The gravy and the au jus needed a bit more work since they were somewhat bland.    As for the seafood selection, crab legs were there and cracked in half for you so that's always a plus.  Few fish items prepared Indian and Italian.  It was good but I wish they had a legit sushi selection rather than just... California roll.  My favorite thing ended up being the pot stickers they had since they were done fairly well.  As for all their other hot foods, everything was... average.  Fried chicken's seasoning was whatever, and the taco station had ground beef that looked like it came from Taco Bell.  Salad bar was lacking as well.    The funniest thing was that they had hummus but no pita bread or pita chips to eat it with.  I know some people like hummus by itself but if they truly spent the time in preparing the buffet, they would've at least thought of that!  The buffet with tax ended up being $28 exactly which is a bit pricey for the offerings.  Thank goodness I didn't have to pay weekend price for this place or else I would've bumped off another star!    Only came here cause I stayed at MGM, so I probably wouldn't come here the next time around.  Definitely pay a little extra and go to the Wynn!",

Food was acceptable but nothing like some of the more lavish buffets;  MGM's buffet is more standard buffet fare with a lot of breakfast options at this time of day.    Desserts were nothing to write home about except for the delicious peanut butter gelato...if you only get one thing from the dessert station make it that.  I'm not big on ice-cream at a buffet but this was truly top notch.  Decor is generic and drab with definite room for some updating but everything was clean and well organized.  Not terrible but certainly not fancy...just middle of the road.  That said, our waitress Donna was so bubbly and nice that it made the whole experience really pleasurable.  She was genuinely warm and a lot of waitresses out there could take some pointers from her.  Thanks Donna for making an average brunch an unforgettable one!",

We bought our ticket at the machine by the door and started our experience.  Atmosphere:  Typical buffet I guess.  It's mildly gross watching obese people in scoot- arounds stuff themselves, but what do you expect at a buffet?  Food:  In all fairness, the food was not bad.  Plenty of veggie options, and it looked like people were getting a little crazy over at the prime rib and crab legs station.  Worked out good for me, because the salad section was virtually empty!  The desserts were beautiful and plentiful, but flavorless.  They needed to have more flavor.    Service:  I had the nicest man take care of us.  Multiple refills, and quick on clearing our plates.  Overall:  It was surprisingly good veggie food for the buffet.  I think most people here are complaining about the price for food quality ratio and I didn't pay, so I can't comment on it.  I would recommend if you can't decide on where to go.",

It's also a good value, as long as you don't play any games, unless you happen to get lucky, of course.",

Pretty pricey on a Saturday night as well as busy but the line moved quickly...   The food was good, the highlight was the steak they make cooked to order with seasoning.. oh so good!  They have an omlette station too which is quite entertaining... Nothing else from the food section really stands out in my mind however... they had the usuals... salads, soups, pastas, and pizza... And the desserts, they are little gourmet kinds of desserts that are sitting over there all cute.  Things like this little cup of tiramisu, mocha, or a little circle of cheesecake.    Definitely not a let down... if you come hungry you'll be satisfied!",

    "text": "When I pay $40 per person for dinner at a Vegas buffet, I expect above average selection and service.  You will find neither here.  The food you can find is OK, but the selection is minimal.  Noticeably absent is any Asian food.  Looking for fried rice, and maybe some orange chicken?  Not there. You'll notice that their plates are very small compared to other Vegas buffets.  There are two possible explanations for this: either because they want you to consume less food, or to make you feel less ripped off when you look at your plate after traversing the whole buffet and find only 1 or 2 items that were worth putting on your plate.  As far as the service, it was non-existent.  I did not receive a single refill for my drink in the entire time I was there.  My waiter simply vanished, and the other waiters wouldn't help - they just kept telling me that my waiter would be right back.  Unless you want to feel ripped off and have a bad feeling about Vegas, don't go here.  The high prices in Vegas these days usually at least come with a good experience.  The buffets at the Mirage and Bellagio are amazing, and almost identically priced to the MGM.  Go to one of those.  Avoid the MGM buffet at all costs.",

I've never been to the Wynn's buffet (ha!) but I can imagine it must be way better then MGM.   I did enjoy the lobster ravioli, crab salad, and the desserts! They were beautiful, rich, and miniature, so you can eat 4 and not feel like a total fatty.   During a previous trip, I had the breakfast buffet, which was pretty good. I prefer the brunch buffet at Paris, but I was satisfied with MGM's.",

You should eat up hardcore, because you're going to wash it down with an ocean of booze and make some poor decisions before your next meal.  It is assured.  This is what you do in Vegas.  This is a big and bountiful buffet.  It is also not Belagio.  It is much cheaper than Belagio and is pretty damn good anyway.  You're at a buffet with everyone else.

    "text": "The food here is horrible.  Me and my hubby came here for lunch last Saturday before I went to go shoot a wedding over at the Flamingo (which is another damn story).  The price tag was off for the food they had to offer, but there wasn't a line around 1:45, it was almost $60 for the both of us.  They didn't even have any shell fish at this price.  I hadn't been to the MGM since I was a kid and wanted to just go and see it again and try the food, which proved to be horrific.  Going up and down the aisles, I realized that a lot of the food was really repetitive, they had your fried/southern comfort food, your \"asian\" food, including teriyaki fish, noodles, sushi, etc.  They had their breakfast items, salads, veggies, fruits, desserts.  I'm pregnant, which totally multiplies my love for food by like umpteenth times, but before being pregnant I could take down a whole cow if you gave me a few hours, but this place couldn't even make pancakes that were appetizing enough.  I had these scalloped potatoes with cheese and sour cream, I believe, on it, and the potatoes weren't even fully cooked.  Phil had some fried chicken and fish items, which were not good.  I also had the teriyaki fish I mentioned earlier and the minute I put it in my mouth I had this overwhelming taste of ginger.  I had the couscous salad which tasted much like toothpaste.  Honestly, I can say that the only thing good about this place was the veggies, oh and the nachos, but how could you fuck up tortilla chips and cheese, but everything else was horrible.  They put such a bad taste in my mouth that I didn't even bother getting desserts and I have the worst sweet tooth, and if anything I'm sure the desserts would've put me in a better mood.  In the end, we left unsatisfied, a trip to Carl's Jr. probably would've done a better job at feeding me and my husband.",

Biscuits and gravy: hard small pucks with \"sausage\" gravy that had the consistency of vegetable oil.  Corned beef hash: actually pretty good.  Potatoes cooked nicely and hash was decent.  There were your staple of bacon, scrambled eggs, fruit and some others, but nothing unique.  And the standards just weren't that good.    There was a desert bar with pies, cup cakes and ice cream, but again very much mediocre.  For $58/three people, probably a decent value as far a Vegas goes, but skip it and go to the food court.",

However for $30 for the breakfast/brunch buffet, I honestly cannot recommend it unless you feel compelled to gorge yourself. We only went because my wife wanted to try the \"Vegas Buffet Experience\" despite my warnings.  The food itself is of average quality, I think one of the better items is the fried chicken. The mini waffles were all overcooked and even though supposedly on a hotplate, cold. Scrambled eggs and homefries were decent, but the sausage and bacon was less than impressive.  What really disappointed though was that our \"server\" was awful, my wife waited at least 10 minutes to get her empty soda refilled and he never took away our dirty plates. Needless to say he didn't get a tip. If only we could remember his name I would tell the people in charge to give him a talking to, all I can say is he was hispanic, in his 40s or 50s and wore glasses.",

We arrived a little before 11 AM on Saturday morning and didn't have to wait all that long to get in - after getting through the first line (for the register) and the second line (waiting to get seated), we probably were all seated within 10 minutes. Since you serve yourself, there's not much to discuss in that arena, although the waitresses are very keen on refilling your champagne glasses without even asking if you want more...I would imagine it's quite easy to get yourself quite loaded before the morning is even out.  As for the food - most of it is standard brunch fare, but a great deal of it isn't all that fresh. The bacon was all over the map -  some pieces were too chewy, other pieces were overly crisp. Scrambled eggs were okay, if not terribly fluffy given how long they were sitting there. While I liked the flavor of the corned beef hash, it was way too dry. The tiny biscuits were good, but again - some were too dried out from sitting under hot lights for who knows how long. The spicy Polish sausage was probably the best thing I ate here, but that's not saying much - I've had better (and fresher) sausage elsewhere.  If you get your meal comped, you may as well show up. Otherwise, I'd probably stick with seeing what a traditional breakfast joint in Vegas would be like. If anything, it reminds me of why I haven't been at buffets in a long time (aside from encouraging me to stuff my face more than I should).",

(Yes, I've tried dog food...)  If you are staying at the MGM, don't eat at the buffet, even if you get a 100 resort credit or two free buffets per stay. You're better off eating street food.   There are other restaurants in the MGM that are much better, but also pricey. You can't use your resort credit either, but paying for something ridiculously expensive is still better than eating at the MGM buffet.",

The prime rib was delicious although cooked too much for my husband's taste.

At $30 a pop it isn't outrageous, but it could be better. Our server also was just ok so that's adds to the experience too.

    "text": "I gave this place 3* because it's a buffet...honestly you can't expect much from them, I guess I had a great one when I was treated at the Ritz a long time ago, but lets face it, in this case you're paying for what you get.  They have a ton of different options, even fresh veggies and fruit (no, not out of a can) and I enjoyed their brunch. I wouldn't go here for anything else other than breakfast food, most of the other dishes were saturated in oil to keep that nice shiny look...and their sushi looked pretty dodgy.   I did enjoy their omelette bar..minus the slight near heart attack I had when the chef used the same spatula for everyones omelette, since I'm a vegetarian, but hey I'm aware that Vegas is not Colorado! The french toast, belgian waffles and pancakes did a great job of pushing me past my mild hangover and I left feeling satisfied. The service is great too, and they offer unlimited mimosas.  Considering the amount of options you are getting for the price, just realize they have to buy in mass quantity so obviously somewhere along the way quality becomes less of a priority.  If you don't feel like dropping $35, Starbucks sells bagels and cream cheese for $5 :)",

I agree with lots of others here, its not the best but not the worst either...but definitely not worth the money they ask for.  If you get this place comped or free, then COOL! You can never go wrong with omelets and bacon for breakfast or mashed potatoes and fried chicken and salads for dinner.  Don't expect much from this buffet and don't pay full price either. Studio B buffet is half the cost and WAY better.   Pros: -Convenient if you're staying at the hotel and can get comped for it, you'll be seated quicker -Has solid buffet basics:fresh green salads and veggies, potatoes and chicken...if you don't go fancy you'll be okay.  Cons: -The \"fancier\" items looked really suspect to me.  -Super busy and kinda nuts in there. Didn't really like the traffic in and around this buffet.",

Everything. Sushi was just horrible tasting and no lite soy. The roast beef and the brisket were so chewy that my boyfriend finally gave up and spit his out. I chewed and chewed but was afraid I would choke trying to swallow it. The crab legs were small but at least they were broken open. The pot stickers were hard. The best thing about this restaurant was the soft serve ice cream and I don't even like dessert but ate it because I was going to leave hungry. The $70+ price tag for two people is ridiculous for the crap they are serving. John Taffer needs to bring Bar Rescue in here to help this place. Gordon Ramsey would just leave and wish em luck on the way out. Just like me.",

The pathetic selection and poorly cooked food was appalling.  The crab legs were barely fit to eat, just horrible condition.  They had breaded fried shrimp that were so fried that they were hard, not edible.  They had fried wonton's in the same condition.  Nothing was good and there was nothing special.  You can get a better buffet at any cheap buffet place.  I heard Las Vegas was famous for good food.  This visit is the lowest point of our vacation.  Be warned.  Don't waste your money.  And, your time standing in the long lines where you have to wait to get certain bad items that are frugally rationed out is such a joke.",

Should have known when I saw the reviews but we got this for pretty much free from The Signature and it was cold and rainy so we stuck to indoors.  Could not even touch the hot dishes.  They looked THAT bad. Couldn't look up from my dish either -- the drab surroundings are terrible.  But I'll spare you the negatives and give you the positives if you are thrifty like me or also lost all your money in Vegas and decide to take the hotel up on their free (or almost free) buffet.  The best (totally edible) items there are:  the hummus - you guys were right. Some of the veggies at the salad bar- you can make a decent, healthy salad. I stuck to this rather than trying the only hot dish that looked sorta good -- the overly creamy mac and cheese.  Eggplant and squash dish with melted cheese was also okay.  The chicken stir fry with peppers for the fajitas/tacos was okay.  Had this with tortilla chips instead of the stale taco shells.  Filled up with guacamole, black beans, and a very fresh tomato salsa was actually very good.  Yeah, that's about it.  Stay away from the scary looking sushi.  Ice cream cone - not bad.  Other desserts were all pretty gross.  Best thing at the entire buffet was something I would never guess or normally have --   the banana nut muffin!",

They try to deliver an international buffet, but the result is quite messy, and I felt it more oriented towards Asian food. Trust me: invest five more bucks and check out Bellagio's buffet.  The lago buffet at Bellagio makes you really feel like you're eating at a high end buffet with some expensive dishes and the food quality, along with ambiance, staff professionality, decor is worth much much more then the money you pay for. I also suggest Ceasars Palace buffet. This one is not as good, high end, expensive feeling buffet as Bellagio's one, but still has so much great inspired Italian dishes, along with favorites American \"mush be there\" choices.",

I couldn't wait to go back but, I was there over Thanksgiving weekend 3 days ago, and got FROZEN crab legs YUCK !!  No STEAK ,  Hand breaded shrimp that was decent, but the breading was falling off and very doughy.  This is Vegas and they obviously are trying to cut costs, how hard is it to boil Crab legs.  The Prime Rib was terrible, a rubber SHOE at best !  The server gave me a piece with blood all over it, should not of been served in the first place and the Server cutting the beef new it as she was starring at me when I walked down to my demise, I went back 5 minutes later to get another piece in hopes of a better cut and it was freaking terrible, looked like rubber and was very dull, no taste.  Out of the group of 7 we were all disappointed, ALL !!  The fruit selection was nothing great, salads average and the dessert was ok if you like Lemon Cheesecake, nothing to scream about.  The wait staff though was good at getting plates and drinks which is why it got 2 stars.  The Lobster Ravioli was so processed and phony, looked good tasted blah,  There was not 1 item I liked or really enjoyed.",

    "text": "A friend and I came here for Sunday brunch because we had $25 credit toward dining, so at $25 per person, we ended up paying half each. Which was probably about what I would want to pay for this buffet.  The food was very hit or miss. I did like their scrambled eggs (although, it's hard to mess up powdered scrambled eggs), the breakfast potatoes (which were moist and nicely seasoned), the California roll sushi, and the cheesy polenta. But perhaps the best thing that I got was the fresh fruit -- namely the pineapple slices. I'm glad the fruit was all fresh.  On the flip side, the gnocchi tasted it like it'd been sitting out for several hours, the blueberry blintzes were doughy and tasted uncooked, the fried shrimp was mostly just batter and the batter was very bland, the creme brulee/custard tart thing was even blander, and the rice krispie treat with dried fruit and icing was okay but extremely soggy and not crispy at all.  The waitress who was serving beverages was incredibly creepy. We asked for two coffees, and when she only brought us one (empty) coffee cup and a large container of hot coffee, we pointed out we wanted two.   She glared at us, reluctantly looked down at her pad, and went, \"Oh, you're right, you asked for two.\" (You're not allowed to get snippy when you wrote down the order and screwed it up.) Then when she brought the second cup, she'd filled it with coffee and glared at us again when she put it down. And then every time she walked by us, she'd look at us funny.  No joke, my friend ended up pouring the coffee out into a bowl because she was afraid the waitress had spit in it or something.  Definitely not going to come back here unless it's free.",

I particularly liked the lunch-time raviolis, curry sea bass, roast asparagus soup; and the breakfast-time pancakes, waffles, and Califoria-Mexican eggs, and various types of sausages. The desserts and pastries are probably too sweet. it's imperative to choose what you eat wisely, since you'll be full sooner than you know it.  Also watch for lines during the following times when specials are in effect: 7-8a breakfast is $9.99 Lunch starts at 11a, but if you get breakfast at 10:30-ish am or 10:40a you can basically merge into lunch with the breakfast rate. Early 4:30-5:30p dinner I think is also discounted.",

Grand Buffet did all of the above, plus a really good Mushroom Ravioli, two Indian dishes and assortment of desserts that I particularly liked.   The entire setup though is a little disorganized. The plates are never where you needed them, you'd have the mashed potatoes next to the sushi, and the taco bar has you bouncing back and forth from one side of the table to another to do your fillings. Very very odd, but I guess if I work for my food then I won't feel as bad for having eyes bigger than my stomach, which is exactly what happened.   Price for lunch was $20.99, and buffet selection was adequate.",

The service was s-l-o-w.      The food was ok at best.  Frankly, it was no different than what one can get at a Golden Corral or Sizzler  in about any city in the country.  Nicely presented but way under seasoned.  Everything kinda tasted the same.  Frankly, at $25, I felt a bit abused.  Oh well, lesson learned...",

We were seated very quickly and there was a good amount of options to choose from, however nothing really stood out as far as taste goes. I got a mix of things: waffles, fiesta scrambled eggs, biscuits, sausage, brownies, fruit, etc. the only thing I actually LIKED was the breakfast pizza. I thought it was a clever idea as I'd never seen it anywhere else and it actually tasted good. When I went back for my plate of fruit, they had new pizza flavors out as well. Other than that, the food was just average or less. The next day we went to Chin Chin's breakfast buffet and I could really tell the difference between the two. Chin Chin had less options but was tastier and fresher. Hopefully their lunch and dinner buffet are better than the breakfast, otherwise I'd spend the money elsewhere for the start of your day.",

The few downsides, other than the price, was definitely how packed the actual buffet was, but you can't really take any points away from them for that.  If you're in the MGM and want something conveniently in the hotel you should most definitely try this out, but be prepares that it is overpriced.",

It was really just the type of food you would come to expect at a buffet with salads, meats, pastas, etc.  However, I was fond of the sushi, where the sushi was actually better than other buffets that serve sushi.

    "text": "I usually hate buffets and this place just confirms on every reason why. But since a free buffet came with out stay at MGM, we felt obligated to go.  There was no variety, and what food was there just completely lacked in any kind of flavor or finesse.  There was a meat carving station which had prime rib (I didn't have any but at least it was there!) and a sausage (which was decent) then there's everything else expected..a small salad bar, some Italian food (like dried lasagne and pizza) some Chinese food (if you can call beef and broccoli Chinese and some fried rice and dried noodles) and some other not very memorable dishes. I was even a bit scared to eat their snow crabs and shrimp cocktail because I thought it might not be the freshest. The desserts were very subpar too.  But good news, I didn't get sick and I made it through this crappiest and saddest buffet. Everything is up from here I guess!!!! And it was free! Actually I wouldn't even come back here again even if it was free. That bad. You're basically just filling your tummy with things. Tasteless useless things. Ick.",

    "text": "This buffet is quite nice, however, not worth the price. Unless you always eat way too much food at one meal, this place is a rip-off and you can do far better. If the price were a few bucks cheaper, it may be worth it. But at the prices they charge -- you'd do better elsewhere, for sure.  If you do wind up going there, make sure you have plenty of time to pace yourself. I made the mistake of going to this and meeting a bunch of people who were practically done when I got there. This isn't MGM's fault; just mentioning it because you should have ample time when you set about eating at this place. It really is massive, so if you're gonna spend the moola, you might as well take the time to truly enjoy it. Don't go with someone who is always in a hurry or who likes to wolf down their food!",

I've read some bad reviews for this place and really wanted to try one of the more highly rated buffet's but we were staying at the MGM Signature so this was easy for us to pop along to, to get us going on a morning.   I found the breakfast selection to be really good. I would guess it is quite hard to mess up a breakfast buffet as most places must do a similar thing, but we always found plenty we wanted to eat especially the made to order pancakes which we delicious especially with chocolate chips. There was also always a queue for the made to order omelettes so I guess they were also good (although I never tried them).  The service was good and I didn't feel we were rushed by our server. I would go again to this buffet at least for breakfast anyway.",

All I wanted was bagels and lox, ham and an omelette.    The buffet was at the halfway mark meaning it wasn't going to close for another 4 hours.  They were out of bagels.  One of the stockers went to look for more bagels and she said they were out for the day.  I said to her \"You mean there are no bagels in this entire casino and hotel?\"  She said yes.  Went to the meat station, they were out of ham.  No more ham for the rest of the day.  Got an omelette and it was over cooked.    Bottom line, I would have asked for my $60 bucks back but we were so hungry.  The only reason this place got 2 stars is the mimosa service.  The guy who brings out mimosa ended up bringing us two pint glasses of champagne.  I even saw him fill up a pitcher full of champagne for a guy.  Now that's classy!

There were a whopping 4 groups coming in to eat and hardly anyone in restaurant. Ridiculous. Now to the food. Very sub par. The crab was not good , veggies bland, the chicken cordon bleu was disgusting. Only thing that was good was the prime rib. It was actually very good. Sausage not bad either. The sushi rolls though were like eating rubber! All the fried food was below average. My girlfriend gagged on some of it and then was sick at her stomach all night forcing us to remain in. The deserts were sparse and not memorable. This experience was a huge disappointment as we bring a large group to Vegas for Super Bowl every year and we hoping this would work for us. We will just  stick to Aria Buffet, Rio Seafood Buffet, and frankly anywhere else but here unless I am craving an entire prime rib!!",

We had a $50 dining credit to use at MGM so I wasn't too upset that the buffet sucked since we didn't pay full price.  And I'm SUPER glad that kids 4 and under are free because this is a really kid-UNfriendly buffet.  No chicken tenders? No fries? Come on, kids live for that stuff! The fruit selection wasn't even very good, so our kiddo ended up eating cheese slices for dinner.  Now, after that glowing review, you're gonna think I'm nuts when I say we went back for breakfast, and you would be right.  We had a long trek from tower 3 at The Signature at MGM Grand and we woke up late.  We were gonna try to hustle our booties over to anywhere but here, but we realized that if we walked we would miss it.  Oh well.  Breakfast was a little better, though, since they had more to offer.  But again, the meats were overcooked, dried out, and overseasoned.  OH WAIT! That's because they were serving the EXACT same things they served the night before!  This time, though, they added fluffy scrambled eggs that were weirdly wet for some reason, cheap bacon, and stale cereal.  My daughter did enjoy the pancakes and blueberries, and I enjoyed the time when it was time to leave.  Two stars - one for the friendly staff, and one for the pecan tart at the dessert station.",

The good: We had fantastic service at this buffet! Our waiter was really attentive, and kept the mimosas flowing! He even sent us each home with a \"coffee\" cup to go filled to the brim with the good stuff :)  The bad:  Long line to get in. Bonus was that we played the $.05 slots and turned $5 into $20 -  enough to cover just over 1/2 of 1 person's breakfast (yes, you read that correctly). Once you pay at the front, you are put into a second line that is divided by table size (1-4pax, 5-9 pax, etc). We were only a group of 3, and the 1-4 line moved fairly quickly. Still took about 20 minutes from arrival to sitting down, despite lots of tables being open inside.  The ugly:  The price for quality of food. You almost can't find a brunch buffet for less than $35, and MGM definitely came in just shy of that. Still ridiculously expensive, but everything is on the strip! The quality of the food, however, was really poor and definitely not worth the money. Powdered eggs, microwaved bacon, soggy sushi, guacamole from a pouch....I could go on but I think you get the idea. While there is a huge variety of food to choose from, none of it was very good.

OMG the steak was perfectly cooked (I ordered med.), tender, and seasoned wonderfully. I loved that the crab is split so there is no cracking required.   There is really not much I can say negative. I kind of wish the desert section would have had a larger variety, but the red velvet cake was delicious and moist.   All of the veggies I tried were cooked to perfection - and not overcooked (as with most buffets).

    "text": "The food selection is vast, but very standard quality. Would have rather fewer options and better quality,  as MGM buffet seemed to have a quantity over quality problem.    The service was awesome though, especially for a buffet! Margarita, our waitress, was super attentive and kept the mimosas flowing and didn't judge us for drinking them too quickly.  In short, I had a decent omelet, and some fruit and veggies, that left me full for hours! I also left with a good buzz from those delicious mimosas so I could hit the strip with confidence!  I should note, I had a free voucher so I wasn't expecting much. Would I return and pay full price? Probably not, but sign up and play MyVegas and you can redeem points and go for free... because who doesn't love free champagne?!    Oh, and in case you're wondering, my favorite buffet is at the Bellagio.",

    "text": "So I was in Vegas over Thanksgiving week and we were going to go to the Bellagio buffet on Thanksgiving day. There was a 3 hr wait. We decided to go to the MGM buffet being that we were going to the David Copperfield show at the MGM that night. There was no wait....... For a reason. It was well below average. I thought it was a level above Sizzler. I don't expect much from Sizzler but I do expect more out of a huge hotel like MGM. Food was dry, bad low end choices. It has variety but quality lacks. The weirdest thing is that all the meats were scattered everywhere. Most buffets I've been to have stuff grouped together accordingly... Not this buffet! The buffet was $40 but should have been $20. It you're not worried about quality, this buffet is for you. You probably have a better dessert choice at home.",

They cut the crab legs in half , the meat at the carving station was salty   and just about every other item I tried was either too bland or had a BAD taste.   I wish I would have gotten the waiter's name because his service sucked. After being seated he neglected our table for about 15 minutes so we finally flagged someone down to help us then they pointed that the guy who was neglecting our table was our waiter. He came over to our table and acted as if he didn't want to even want to be bothered with us.  I seen other reviews and I ignored them because I tend to find the good in any situation but I'm serious when I say I would absolutely never eat here again.",

    "text": "First of all, I want to give this place 3.5 stars but yelp wont let you. Okay, so I was at the Dead and Company concert at the Grand Arena last Saturday night (May 27/17) and ate here in the afternoon. The buffet was $42.99 which is expensive in my opinion, however, it did include unlimited beer and wine. The house wine was pretty good and the unlimited beer included only Budlight and Stella. There were three other beers also but that was not included and you had to pay extra. IF there is unlimited beer, please make all the beers unlimited. Management should consider this.  If you like seafood, this buffet is worth it and you will get your moneys worth. They had crab legs, salmon, lobster?, shrimp, etc..They ask you if you want it steamed, fried, or whatever. The only seafood I like really is shrimp and I had enough. The rest of the buffet was OK in my opinion. The prime rib, brisket, fried chicken, were all fine. I had no problems with the food, however, the corn on the cob tasted \"old\" and the chinese rice and spanish rice were not the best. The salads were delicious. The dessert bar was really bad. No flan and no cheesecake. Really? Most other places have these two items, but this dessert bar did not and was really small. As far as the beverages, you have to get up and get it yourself. The only thing the servers do is pick up your plate for another round of food.  Honestly, I think the price for the weekend buffet is expensive. The servers were OK. I don't blame the servers if things are not right. You have to put the blame on management and they need to make things better so everything can run efficiently and smoothly. Like I said before, make all beers free with the buffet price and improve the desserts.   I still recommend this buffet if you dont have time to walk down the long Vegas blocks to search for another buffet. There will never be a perfect buffett, so just try this one way, and write down your opinion. Peace to all.",

Being a conisseur of Asian food, I gave the Kung pao chicken, Mongolian beef, and fried rice a try...terrible. No flavor whatsoever. Whomever cooked it, does not know how to cook Asian food. The flavor, ingredients, and \"cutting style\" we're all way off. The really should try to get this right considering all the Asian gaming money at the baccarat tables. The fried rice looked and tasted more like rice-a-roni.  The American style food, ie chicken, mashed potatoes, etc, we're so so and lacked taste. They do have a decent salad selection but I didn't partake. They had some excellent taco ingredients and I made a very good taco but it was the few highlights of the buffet.  The omelette station was awesome. Tell the man what you want on it and he hooks it up. He had six individual pans going at once! Yummy...  Desert is lacking. Where are the pies? I tried two types of their cake that I thought would be good-I was wrong. The carrot cake and the red velvet cake were so so at best. How do you make a tasteless carrot cake?  The service personnel were all helpful and friendly, kudos to them.   For the price they normally charge, this buffet is over-priced. I suggest eating at one of the other restaurants at the MGM.",

Sure, they have prime rib, NY Steak, crab legs and shrimp, but everything else was mediocre at best. The room itself is very uninspiring - my college dining commons looked nicer. The staff were nice enough, but service was slow and the waitress forgot to bring our drink order a few times. It's just a very average buffet that is charging ridiculous prices. For the money, I'd rather go to Wicked Spoon at Cosmo, Cravings buffet at the Mirage, or the Buffet at Aria or Bellagio. The only thing this place has going for it is that its MyVegas redemption has less restrictions than the other MGM Resort buffets....",

Loud, rude, inconsiderate, covered in tattoos, piercings and sweat from their testosterone shots. There were a couple of employees with headsets walking the room and it was hard to tell if it was to let the front desk know about open tables, or if it was security.   Food was very mediocre at best. Basic watery eggs, greasy bacon, stale looking muffins, soggy waffles. The desserts didnt even look close to anything you'd want to waste the calories on. What you'd probably find in a hometown buffet, Circus Circus or Fremont street.   It's clear MGM Resorts is only concerned with attracting the under 30 crowd now who don't really know much if anything about manners or common decency. If MGM has decayed this much, I weep for their other properties. Probably all the same swill just dropped off one at a time at different casinos each morning.",

    "text": "MGM GRAND BUFFET BREAKFAST: so good, we had it twice!  On our first morning in the MGM Grand Hotel, we opted to go for the buffet breakfast, and it was incredible! The buffet costs $17.99 per position (excluding tax), but if you are smart travellers like us, then you should take advantage of the hotel's MLife loyalty scheme, which entails playing the MyVegas Slots and MyVegas BlackJack apps on Facebook or iPad. These apps enable you to obtain loyalty points, which can be redeemed for rewards such as: free buffet breakfasts or dinners, monorail tickets, 2 for 1 drinks, room discounts, etc, etc. The rewards can be for most participating hotels on The Strip, so you are not just restricted to the hotel you are staying in. For anyone visiting Vegas, then I wholeheartedly recommend using these apps to make the most of your visit. There are some T&Cs to consider, like you can only redeem three rewards within a 30 day period, but using them for 2 for 1 show or buffet tickets would be my advice, and totally worth it!  Anyway, back to the breakfast buffet! It was fantastic! We redeemed our first reward, which was free buffet breakfasts for two. The buffet had a massive selection of pastries, cold meats, rolls & bagels, cereals, fruit, bacon, sausages, scrambled egg, omelettes, waffles and pancakes, and a bunch of delights from all other cuisines. If you wanted, you could even have pizza for breakfast!  The buffet has basic service, which means you are shown to your seat, drinks order taken and plates cleared away. Therefore a normal service too is sufficient. The buffet also included complimentary soft drinks and coffee. However for an additional cost of $12.99 you can get unlimited drinks (within 2 hours), which includes champagne, beer, wine, other alcoholic beverages. I think this is applicable for the dinner buffet, but there is nothing stopping you adding this to your breakfast order. It is Vegas after all!  When offered a buffet, I like to enjoy a heart meal set me up for the whole day. Therefore, with a coffee, I had bacon, scrambled egg, pork sausages, corned beef hash and chorizo with potatoes. I am a big fan of bacon, and it was nice thin rashers cooked to a crispy goodness. Heaven! I seldom eat pork sausages as I am a Bratwurst kinda guy, but these were really nice and a good quality. The whole combination was a good mix and the quality was a very high standard. The chorizo hash was a little spicy for me in the morning, but still tasty! I also sampled a breaded mozzarella ball, and I had a portion of waffles and pancakes with blueberries and syrup, which was a really nice, sweet and fluffy breakfast. During my second visit, I sample a vanilla cheesecake; that was awesome! I love cheesecake, and I have pretty high standards when it comes to cheesecake. If they serves this in the evening then I would come for the dinner buffet.  Overall, the breakfast buffet At the MGM Grand is definitely great value with a fantastic variety and good quality food.",

    "text": "Only went here because I was tired and didn't feel like leaving my hotel,staff is very friendly but it's a buffet, how much staff interaction should there be? Lets talk about the buffet, selection was poor, only had about 1 or 2 items from each region, I was really craving some good Italian meatballs but all they had was pizza and lasagna. Lasagna was half decent. So then I decided to go to the carving station, the prime rib was ALL fat. I got about 3 or 4 bites of actual beef, the turkey was wayyyyy over seasoned and tasted like turkey you would get in school lunches on turkey pieces and gravy day. The desserts were good but again, the selection just wasn't there and wasn't creative enough...and it was not busy at all I went as soon as they opened for dinner and stayed about 2 1/2 hours so I could make sure to get my moneys worth. The only positive side and reason I gave this review 2 stars instead of 1 is for $15 extra they have a nice assortment of beverages for you to choose from at the bar. Idk anywhere else in Vegas you can drink all you want for $15. Maybe it's to get you so drunk you won't realize how bad the food is and how much they just royally screwed you out of $50. Honestly I've been to better buffets at the casino in Buffalo, NY.....yes you read that correctly, shit hole buffalo has a better buffet then you. Wtf MGM step up yo game!",

However, what really makes this place hit or miss is the desserts.  Now, I know what you're thinking, desserts for breakfast?  That's overkill.  But, you're wrong.  So wrong in fact, that that's almost blasphemous!  At no time in life is dessert overkill, okay?  Okay!  Anyway, sometimes the desserts will be really good, sometimes you'll think to yourself that you could've got better desserts in the vending machine next to your room.

I love mixing breakfast and lunch and dinner and dessert all in one sitting.   The problem I had with the Grand Buffet was that I didn't find anything too exciting the first two rounds. The omelet line was way too long for a buffet. I'm not going to fill up on salad bar that wasn't even that exciting.   The sushi - you can pass. No brainer that it's made beforehand since it's on platters.   Salads and salad bar - nothing too exciting there.   Meat - the Chili BBQ chicken was good, mainly drumsticks and wings. The fried shrimp was good, the cooked shrimp was a little on the small side and slimy.   Dessert - I liked that most were in tiny little cups so I took a fair sampling. Had a bite or two of each but didn't find any that I wanted to devour. The chocolate dipped Rice Krispie Treats were a nice surprise but the chocolate was waaaayy too sweet. And you'll rarely hear my disparaging chocolate.   It also costs $2.50 extra per person for the bottomless mimosas. They are premixed. The iced tea is not brewed, it's fountain. Yuck.   Next time try the Spice Market buffet in Planet Hollywood (even though this one has gone down hill since it's no longer the Aladdin) or the Bellagio even though more pricey.",

The fried chicken, Italian entrees (yes all four options) were tasteless. The \"hot cheesy\" bread was cold and bread from the basket was hard. We don't have kids but there aren't any kid friendly options other than pizza and cold fries. The only good thing were the vegetables ...how odd is that?

If you, too, are looking for the lavish selection that \"Las Vegas buffets\" brings to my mind, go to another hotel's buffet.  The best item was the fried shrimp. Prime rib was okay. And desserts, although they had a pretty good selection, tasted cheap.  Most of the bite-size portions were 90% whipped cream and 10% cake. Not worth my $20...

    "text": "When it comes to Las Vegas, one of the attractions is a gluttonous dinner at a casino buffet. Las Vegas is famously known for its buffets. When I was in Vegas years ago, I remember the glorious Caesar's Palace buffet that my family and I ate at, so I was kind of excited to find out that we got a free buffet at the MGM Grand. Sadly, the only saving grace to this buffet was that it came with our hotel room. To any visitors looking for a buffet experience, I HIGHLY recommend that you avoid this place at all cost. I would recommend eating dropped table scraps from the MGM food court before eating at this place... yes it is that bad!  The service was pretty standard when it comes to service at any buffet. Waiter comes in and takes your drink order then you go to town on the food selection. I ended up eating some crab legs, and roast beef at my MGM buffet experience. The crab legs were very tasteless... almost like these legs were thawed from a frozen pack of pre-cooked crab legs that one can buy at their local super market. The texture of the legs was very dry and stringy. One would expect food of this quality at dormitory cafeteria buffet at any University on Tuesday nights, let alone, at Las Vegas. Not tasty at all. The roast beef was so-so. The slices were pretty small, and that beef itself was way overcooked, which lead to the meat being tough. It was a step above dormitory cafeteria food, but also a several steps below an average Golden Corral.  The desserts were better. Its like the typical desserts that you will find at any buffet, such as the self serve ice cream, premade cakes, cookies and such. But then you would expect desserts of this quality at a generic buffet, not at a Las Vegas resort and casino. If you are staying at the MGM Grand and received a free MGM buffet voucher, then by all means, eat the free food. If the only buffet experience that you have ever had was at your undergrad dorm cafeteria, a hospital buffet or at a friend's dumpster eating 3 week old Thanksgiving left overs, then this might be your place to eat, however you will get more bang for your buck at the McDonalds food court on the other side of the building. Otherwise, stay away!!!!!!!",

Sushi rolls were dry, salmon was dry, the steaks and prime rib was juicy but salty.  Desserts were minimal and no creme brulee.  Okay if it was $25 per person not $39. We will not be back.l",

What an amazing surprise, the prime rib was some of the best I've had, and I've had it at many places around the country, the sausage was also excellent. The crab legs were great, although some were a tad salty; the selection is great with 8 lines not including the awesome dessert line.  I will return.",

Sunday brunch may be the best deal for the price though.   Again, if you like lots of seafood and nothing else, it will be worth the trip.  Not at all worth it for sushi, pizza, other greasy fried or oily dishes..ugh.. They had a pretty good dessert section too!  I loved those mini cups of mousses, cakes, tiramisu, etc.",

    "text": "Overall, I thought this was fine.  But unfortunately for this buffet, I had champagne brunch at Paris first, and for me nearly anything else would pale in comparison.  The BF and I went here for dinner before seeing David Copperfield.  We caught it at the right time and had virtually no wait.  A quick survey of the food revealed a pretty standard spread in Vegas--carving station, crab legs, sushi, potatoes done every which way, salads, and different little international dishes here and there.  They even had a kids' section of the buffet.  On the one hand if I had kids, I would appreciate it.  On the other hand, I don't believe in brining your kids to Vegas, no matter how much they've tried to clean it up and make it a family friendly place.  (Tangent Alert: I'm sorry, but the stumbling drunk chicks in f-me heels and flicking of the cards on every street corner tells me that this indeed NOT a great place for your family vacation.  Get a sitter.  Send them to Grandma.  Wait for 21.)  I decided to ignore the time-wasting carbs and get down to business, which was the prime rib and steamed Alaskan crab legs. Both were great.  I really don't remember eating much else.  The dessert selection was also pretty standard, and nothing truly stood out to me besides the bread pudding and the chocolate creme brulee.  I like to try new things all the time, so when faced with a choice I'd probably pick somewhere else in Vegas to do a dinner buffet next time, but if I had no alternative, the MGM Grand Buffet is just fine.",

    "text": "Viewers, you have been warned do not spend your money at this buffet!  If it's free with your hotel package, sure go ahead but directly out of your own pocket you can do much better at other places.  We were there first night in Vegas, before our show of KA there.  Starving/Tired to death after a long flight, we decided to try this one despite the reviews we saw.  It's $35 for dinner per person, we should've jumped right off the boat when seeing no one was lining up at this buffet (check out all other better reviewed buffets and see how long the lines are especially for a dinner), but it was an honest rookie mistake.  So we paid and entered and I was astonished to find out that about 1/5-1/6 of the food countertops were covered with no food existence.  I thought it was the timing initially since we entered around 5pm, but after about 1 hour, I finally realized that was it.  It's a \"Grand buffet\" with much less food selections than everybody else who dares to charge such a premium for admission.  Not only did they lack food choices, but also hands.  Our waiter only came to the table to refill the drink literally 3 times for the 1 hour session we had in this place, as he needed to run around a lot of different tables.  Only three highlights:  Prime rib (tender and full flavored), snow crab legs (they cracked the legs open for you already, so no effort from your side); and a great selections of desserts.  However, as I said in the very first, for $35 you should go to Wynn (we did and it was awesome) and Bellagio (saw the LONG line everyday and dared not join the competition).  Definitely not worth the price!",

The sorbet was so artificially flavored, it was bad.   Overall, if you can get this around $20, go to it! If not, head to the Treasure Island buffet, much better quality for less.",

My favorite was the beef with broccoli, from the Asian cuisine section.  All of the meat was quality steak, with none of the chewy, grisly bits you would find at a cheaper restaurant.  The sushi, chicken and apple sausage with sauerkraut, and taco bar were also good. The dessert bar was nice, and there was even a sugar-free section, for those who are into that type of thing.  Bottom line: the food is good, and as long as you're going to eat 3+ plates of food (for $40) it is definitely worth it.",

Most of the entrees were not very good.  Stand outs were the short ribs and chili chicken.  The do pasta extremely poorly.  We only managed to eat one bite of both the lasagne and the shrimp stuffed ravioli w/ pesto sauce.  If I hadn't ready the description of the dish I never would have known it was shrimp stuffed OR had a pesto sauce.  The filling was white and mushy with no taste.  The pesto sauce was dry and green.    The vegetables and salads were outstanding!  It's really hard to believe.  There was mashed butternut squash that was at the very end of the buffet that was very very good.  It was next to made to order NY steak and had already been cooked.  Not sure where the \"made to order\" came in.  Broccoli, roasted vegetables, fish with mango sauce and five grain salad were also very good.  The Tuscan bread salad was awful. The turkey from the carving station was not good either.  Hard to believe that they could mess up vegetable pizza, but they did.    The dessert bar had great chocolate flan, but not much else of note.  The service was not much better.  They promptly cleared dishes the moment you got up and they were very good about bringing fresh silverware/napkins, but they managed to spill water on us every time they refilled our glasses!  The iced tea was delicious.    I would spend my money and calories somewhere else!",

The wait was really short, but when we got in we couldn't figure out why we had to wait at all as the dining room was near empty at about 6PM on a Saturday.  Isn't that dinner time?  The ambiance was really weird and the air conditioning was stale and did not seem like it was turned up high enough.  I sampled the spinach gnocchi, cheese polenta, cheese ravioli, curried sea bass as well as the vegetarian pizza, and a variety of deserts and must admit that the best part of the meal according to my taste buds was the desert and even that was mediocre.  Sorry, but if I spend $32.99 after tax I expect some outstanding food and this was not outstanding.  Sorry MGM Grand Buffet I will not be back.",

I was most excited about MGM's buffet because I'd heard so much about it, and I'm a fan of crab legs. I was so disappointed. The crab legs had to have been the smallest, most malnourished little babies I have ever seen. They were not flash cooked to help the meat pull away from the shells, so getting into them was almost impossible. While there is a large selection of food, I was not impressed with the overall quality. I wanted so badly to love this buffet because I wanted to make it part of my Vegas excursion every year, but this one just doesn't stack up for me. I think it is overpriced (about $40 per person) for what you get, especially given that buffets are in abundant supply in Vegas. So, I'm scratching MGM off of my list, but I'm glad I tried it.",

My brother in law joined us for dinner so there was a total of 3 of us. I had a Buy One Get One Free dinner buffet comp and saw that the price for a Weekday dinner was $32.99 each....Initially the cashier charged us $120 something and we were like \"Whoa, wait a minute..., there's only 3 of us and one of our dinners is free!!\" She adjusted the bill and my husband didn't even look at the total but signed his credit card receipt as we were busy talking.... later in the evening we saw the charge come thru on our credit card as $111!!!!! I called MGM to talk with someone and was told that they were on \"Event pricing\" due to a March Madness basketball game being on.... mind you, there were no TV's in the restaurant to watch the game!!! This was not disclosed to us prior to our purchase and no where is that stated anywhere!!!! I called and left a message for the food and beverage manager to please contact me several hours ago, and have yet to have my call returned!!!! Be very Leary when you dine here, as you will most likely pay much more than you had expected!!!! I feel that this is a bait and switch tactic, and if it were an honest mistake, someone would have contacted me already to resolve the issue..... it's a shame too, because the food was really good and the unlimited beer and wine included was a nice feature, but not for almost $50 per person!!!!  John H., this wasn't the only website that listed the prices.... How can I reach you?",

The layout is different since they renovated some years ago.  I checked everything out first.  After looking around, I got a New York steak piece (not really NY steak) but it was OK and there was still a small amount of pink.  There were also creole shrimp and they were very good, very spicy!  I added a chicken cordon bleu which was not the best of my first selections.  The fried wonton were not good at all and should be avoided.  Rounding out the first plate was some pasta Bolognese which had a surprising amount of heat from ground red pepper.  It was pretty good for a buffet.  Someone wasn't afraid to spice things up a bit.  For the second plate, I got some sushi roll slices which was standard buffet type.  I got two pieces of spicy Portuguese sausage which was quite good, and I went back for more of the pasta.  I loved the pepper heat of it.  I had some carrot cake and a chocolate pudding for dessert.  These were standard buffet type desserts.  Nothing special but not bad.  The staff was a little slow with bringing my first iced tea but when she did bring it, she brought two glasses at once which was nice.    The buffet is OK but for the price, I'd go to others which have a better selection of items.",

For $40 each, my friends and I hit up this spot for a quick bite before hitting the town. Needless to say, we were all very unimpressed by the selection of food here. It is very diverse, but also was unappealing and in my honest opinion not very tasty. I like to destroy several plates at a buffet, but here... I only did 1 dish. I wasn't motivated to seek or eat more. Very unfortunate, because the service was decent here. But that doesn't make up for the meal.  I had the assorted seafood, sushi, mixed veggies and some steak. The crab legs were opened which was cool, but very small in proportion. You'd need several to feel like you're eating something. The sushi, as expected, was fishy and the rice was hard from coldness and sitting around. The steak was chewy (I didn't expect it to be filet or anything), and also not flavorful. Everything made my stomach... apathetic, to say?  Nothing here is specifically awful, but for a place as exquisite as the MGM, I would have expected much better out of them. Next time I'm in town I'll play it safe and come for lunch if things seem different.  Actually, no. I'm going back to Bacchanal.",

    "text": "My wife and I decided to come here for the Sunday Brunch because we had about an hour to kill before leaving for the airport and in hindsight, I think we wish we would have just picked up a sandwich at 7-11 because that's what the quality felt like here.  We all know that Vegas buffets are hit-and-miss at best depending on what you like.  I tend to lean towards healthy alternatives so I look at a salad bar and the items in includes with a pretty critical eye.  When a salad bar essentially has lettuce, carrots, croutons, cheese and some diced lunch meat, that's unimpressive to me.  They had one soup which was some weird vegetable slop.  The shrimp were about half the size of the shrimp at Mirage.  The sushi is low budget.      About 90% of it was cheap breakfast items and low budget lunch choices.  I guess if I loved to fill up on lukewarm egg rolls, greasy meat or waffles then it would be more towards my liking but when the hummus doesn't even have anything to dip in it, you know you are in the wrong place.  It just comes across as something that needs an update.  For a hotel as big as the MGM Grand, the buffet feels like something you would see Downtown or off the strip.",

    "text": "The four star rating is based on an average of my two visits here this trip. Don't judge-I like buffets. The weekday dinner gets 3 stars while the weekday 'brunch' gets 5 stars, averaging 4. The dinner buffet isn't a disaster, it just is a little miss-priced for what you get. It's a perfectly acceptable $25 buffet believing it's worth $35. But don't we all think too highly of ourselves now and then?  The crab (both dungeness and snow) give the illusion of a fancier buffet, but it can't make up for the lesser quality on other items.  Brunch on the other hand is very fairly priced at $23 (tax included), and produces some very good dishes.  The early bird brunch is even a better deal at $3 less, but who really wants to wake up early in Vegas.",

But today, all I can say is \"meh\" It wasn't bad, per se, it just wasn't anything to write home about.  And with all the amazing food options there are in Vegas, you are better off spending your time and money elsewhere. There is a cold/salad station that had the typical items.  It also had some cheeses, buffalo chicken dip and similar items.  A seafood area had \"freshly steamed\" crab legs.  They were hard to crack and not very flavorful.  If also took a while for the server to bring us crackers. There was an Asian section with sushi, rice and a variety of typical Chinese buffet type entrees. Carved meats were ok but nothing that stands out. Desserts were pretty low key too.  Several flavors of ice cream, a few cakes and some pastries.  A few were tasty, but nothing compared to what some of the other buffets offer. Overall, it is an ok meal, but not worth the price.",

Better than even the carving stations which though some fatty pieces was flavorful and cooked nicely. The seafood section had crabs legs(ok as over cooked as reheated in boiling water) but also a made to order scampi style dish that was solid.  The grill was good as well, the strip steaks were small but tender and I had a half dozen getting rarer and rarer and was better each time. Think they cook Med rare to Med at the rarest but still good! Even the first Med well peace was good. Fresh bread pudding was white bread but I liked the flavor and texture so good on them! Anything fresh seemed good but the the only full fail for me was the sushi and it was brought out fresh so I assume it's not rolled fresh as texture was whack. Free beer and wine is whatever as beer fills me up and kind a wine snob but for $9 you could go to the full bar and I have. A sweet tooth so those frozen drinks can be trouble or a good pre game if you are not here to impress anyone ha!",

Secondly, the food is not great, for 10 more bucks you can go to a different hotel and have much better food. There was no music in the restaurant so all you heard were other guests conversations and the two bartenders speaking extremely loudly to each other. Again, being a local coming to the strip for a buffet we hadn't try, we were disappointed.",

The fiancee and I settled on this as we were hungry and truth be told, we couldn't be bothered to walk back down to the other restaurants in the MGM - these Vegas casinos are huge  We happened to visit on crab legs night, one of the more expensive evenings. A tip for you - if you're not sure how to get full value on anything, just follow the crowd of Asians. We're super thrifty and love getting value for money  I did eat my share of seafood. Once I tore myself away from the seafood area, there were stations serving lovely prime rib and other cooked meats. I don't think you can eat everything even if you only took one of each thing  You should head here if you're in town and looking for a typical Vegas experience",

    "text": "The buffet at the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino is my favorite.   I was in town for a few days and ate there on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings.   The price minus tip is $36.00 per person (I notice many cheap skates that do not tip and that bothers me, maybe they should include an 18% gratuity).   On Monday I had the shrimp, various fish dishes, pasta, salad and some other items along with the Prime Rib (I wish the slices were thicker and they discourage asking for more then one slice), Turkey and the sausage.   I also had some sushi, red peppers and Spanish rice.   I also had apple and orange juice as well as some cranberry as well with some water.   For dessert I had a vanilla ice cream with M&M's.   The second night I had basically same choices, this time I had some pasta too and watermelon. I had the grape flavored Desani and for dessert I had vanilla ice cream with the apple cobbler!  The food is good and the place is kept immaculate.   But what keeps me coming back is the excellent service from the time you arrive to the time you leave. Everyone is nice and friendly and eager to please ( I wish I could say the same for the MGM Front Desk, but that's another review).   I always leave a 20% tip in cash for the server.   I noticed that most of the help is from another place or country and they seem to like their jobs. It is a casual crowd of all ages who just wants to wind down and have a good and hearty meal.   No matter where I stay, I make it a point to dine at the MGM Grand buffet!  Highly recommend!",

    "text": "First Vegas buffet in the books, and here's the breakdown.  HOW IT WORKS You wait in a line to pay for your food, then wait on another line to be seated. There are two different lines based on party size. I dined on a Wednesday evening for $32.99 which included unlimited beer and wine. For $15 more, full bar.  WHAT THEY HAVE The restaurant is sectioned into your buffet foods, beverage stations, and dessert section. The buffet has a salad section, crab legs section, fresh baked pizza, carving station, bread assortments, and then other foods. Genres include American, Chinese, Italian, Vietnamese (just pho), Japanese (sushi boat), and Mexican. The variety of food is good, and they do label which options are vegan or gluten free.  FOOD QUALITY  It was overall just ok. I really enjoyed the hot and cold crab legs, and they have Dungeness available. The fresh out the oven pizza was good as well. I also enjoyed the cocktail shrimp already peeled, and the cheese ravioli and butternut squash ravioli. Although I did not try the sushi, the rice looked dry, and there was too much rice compared to the fish. The prime rib was disappointing due to lack of flavor and sort of chewy. If you eat seafood, its probably worth the price.   SERVICE  They pretty much just clear off your plates. No one asked us how everything is or said anything else to us after explaining we get our own drinks.  Would I come back? Likely not, heavy competition in the Vegas area, a lot of other places to try.",

Service was top notch which is always nice, and the food had flavor! Kudos to the chefs. I eat vegetarian and I was pleasantly surprised at the selections. Lots of fresh veggies, salad sections of course, nice assortment of vegan curry dishes, and drum roll please...wine, beer, selected cocktails unlimited! If you ever come to Vegas you soon realize everything is expensive. Drinks cost you and arm and a leg. So I truly enjoyed wine with my meal.

    "text": "So, while in Vegas, my family and I wanted to go to a seafood buffet.  The question was, where can we go that is not too expensive and worth the price for the food selection.  My cousin that lives there recommended we go to the MGM.  I have never been there before, even just to walk around so I was a little skeptical.  He had never even eaten here before so we were reluctant to go, but did it anyways.  It was actually not a bad choice at all.   The variety of food was so good and they had their seafood prepared different ways.  I truly appreciate that there were people serving you the seafood rather than you being able to get it yourself because everyone always got some and it never ran out.  Granted they only gave you so much, you can go up as many times as you want!  They have the crab legs cold, or boiled, they also had mussels and clams too.  You could get a mix of everything.  The other food was really good for buffet, but I would say that the choices for dessert weren't that great.  We didn't look for a place that had more choices for dessert because we really just wanted the seafood and other foods.  Oh and you can get your own drinks so you don't have to wait to be served.  They also have an all you can drink wine and beer option you can add on to your meal.  Overall, I would go back and I recommend this place to those who are going for the food, not dessert.",

We walked in on a Saturday at  4 p. m., and were seated right away. The area was clean. The staff was friendly. Long food stands contain all kinds of food including a few Mexican and Indian dishes. There is all the crab legs and shrimp. Prime rib and turkey were at the carving station.  These counters were clean. Food was refreshed when pans were low. The food was very good and tasty.  Of the foods the Mexican, being mostly tortillas wraps looked dry and needed to be refreshed with tomato sauce. I tried three small cake pieces and they too were dry. Other desserts included cookies, puddings and blue Hawaiian ice cream!  A special perk was that beer and wine came with the meal. You do get your own drinks. The tables are bussed regularly to keep the area clean. Be sure to get a free MGMLife card at the service desk for a meal discount and others. For the reviewers with negative comments, spend more money elsewhere and see if the food is a whole lot better. Vegas is a Casbah and a food Mecca.",

(That's right; I asked the food manager!) There was no fresh fruit other than some cantaloupe and pitiful looking watermelon. The tri tip roast was as tough as shoe leather - complete inedible! The brisket was not tasty.  I'm giving 2 stars only for the unlimited mimosas (champagne is also available) and the bacon, fish and chicken were OK.   We paid $71.42 (including tax) for two. I thought that was a fair price to expect a better quality buffet but maybe not in Vegas. We would gladly have paid more elsewhere for a quality meal.",

There was room for the 10 of us until we mentioned one person was not going to be eating. That's where it all went south.    This place tried to convince me that they were able to accommodate 10, but not 9.  The customer service  I received was despicable.  We paid over FOUR Grand for a room this weekend and the fact that we were turned away from a buffet for some bs reason is just not ok. This place is an embarrassment to the mgm name and so is their management. Such a disappointment.",

Regardless we enjoyed the food and especially the warmed to order seafood selections.   One complaint I have is on their website the weekday dinner is advertised at $32.99 per person and was charged $93.00 for two people. If not for the semi False pricing, would've given them 5 stars. We were tired and hungry so we did not dispute and enjoyed our dinner.   Someone must've complained because as of today(10-26-2018) they removed their buffet pricing from their website.",

I love buffets, but this one was SUPER underwhelming, and expensive to boot. Almost $20 for breakfast? We stayed at the Monte Carlo last year, and their buffet was better and less expensive!  There was a ton of food - I thought they had a good selection, but nothing was really that tasty. The bacon was all underdone and greasy, the salami/cheese/antipasto table seemed like it had been sitting out for FAR too long, and I grabbed an eggs benedict cup (made of a little sourdough bowl with the egg, etc inside of it) but didn't eat it because the egg looked so undercooked once I was back at the table. The omelet bar was really the shining star, but there was a consistent line of 10-12 people there at all times and we were on a time crunch, so I didn't get a chance to try it out.   To be fair, I only had breakfast there, but based on the food I got for breakfast I wouldn't go back. Buffets in Vegas are a dime a dozen, and this one had absolutely nothing special to it.",

    "text": "We expected less, so we were pleasantly surprised by the food quality and freshness. After reading reviews, we were glad the tickets to the buffet were complimentary for my birthday. Our waiter was a much, much older gentlemen who seemed quiet and shy. He was attentive and our water glasses stayed full. He took plates away in a timely manner, so I really have no complaints about the service here.  The food is decent. You aren't going to get bells and whistles and foie gras, but for what it is, we liked it. The more traditional \"American\" foods were great. From the mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, and steak, it was all quite good. The rolls and bread choices are delicious.The salad bar gets a thumbs up, and almost all of the meats were good if you aren't too picky. For the seasoned foodie, this might be the pits for decent food. But when you come in with very little expectation, you might leave a bit surprised. The price tag is a bit much for the quality of the food, but when in Vegas, what do you really expect? Where this buffet falls flat is the lack of any \"make your own\" areas for food. Usually for the price of the ticket, you'll expect a nice fajita, Hibachi, or some sort of freshly prepared food station for those who are into that kind of thing. It isn't here, unfortunately. The veggies are excellent. There's corn on the cob, broccoli, cauliflower, and an array to choose from. They're cooked well, and some of it is paired with BBQ/cookout foods. My girlfriend particularly loved the different types of sausage to choose from. My favorite was the fried chicken, and her's was the lamb. During dinner hours, there are King Crab legs and other seafoods, and they were decent enough. The sushi left something to be desired, but buffet sushi is generally a difficult task.  The MGM soars sky high when it comes to the dessert area. It may not be as big as Bacchanal, but the quality is there. We tried them all. There was cheesecake, cupcakes, tiramisu, fudge brownies, chocolate covered strawberries, cakes in cups, banana pudding, and they were all spectacular. We engorged our tummies on these the most. We even went back for seconds, and we would definitely visit again for this section. Every single one we tried had something good about it. I definitely recommend the key lime pie and custard. All of the desserts are decorated cutely with polka dots or bits of decorative chocolate on top.   Overall, is this the best buffet to choose? Absolutely not. The Wynn or Bellagio are worth their price in gold as far as quality and quantity are concerned. However, if you're staying at the MGM hotel and don't want to walk down the strip for dinner, it's not the worst place you could have dinner, either. We asked at check in if we could have a trip to the buffet complimentary for my birthday. The clerk obliged, so we weren't left feeling dissatisfied with an overpriced meal. Even so, had we paid, I can't say we would have been completely disappointed. It's a lot better than some other choice buffets on the strip.",

    "text": "Stayed at the MGM recently. Based on reviews, figured I wouldn't be stopping by the buffet. Then, Monday late morning, when we wanted to grab a bite, we found ourselves here. Our first try was the main cafe, but the line and wait was ridiculous. A quick call over to the buffet and found the price per person would be similar to the price per person at the cafe. But we'd have more choices and, more importantly, there was little to no wait. And who wants to spend valuable vacation time on a line?!  I wasn't expecting much, to be honest, and was pleasantly surprised. The place was clean, most items were refilled regularly, and the plates were removed from our tables (and that service was better than one of the fancier Strip buffets).   Beverages are self-serve, which always is a perk for the kids. They had a Coke machine, which lets you customize your soda. Milk, chocolate milk, flavored waters, coffee, tea, and juices.   Some of the food was surprisingly very good - the pizza was NY style and delish. There was a great broccolini dish, and the chicken fajitas had fresh tasting veggies and tender/moist chicken. The Asian assortment was mostly mediocre, some of it tasted like frozen appetizers (like the egg rolls), although the dumplings were pretty good as was a chicken dish. Salad bar was decent with fresh veggies. There was an excellent pecan-crusted fish dish, fried chicken, pasta, and of course the dessert bar (which was hit or miss). Didn't try the sushi - even the best buffets tend to put our poor sushi. Lots of options, and a bunch of pretty good items to fill you up.  For the price (especially in comparison of prices for anything on the Strip), it was a very pleasant brunch experience. Nothing fancy, but pretty good food. I wouldn't go out of my way to visit it again, but if I stay at the MGM, I'd definitely give it another shot.",

    "text": "BREAKFAST ONLY REVIEW:  If I were rating the breakfast service at the MGM buffet based solely on the 3 items I filled up on, I would rate it 5 stars. The buffet serves a grand variety of breakfast foods though, so actually rating the buffet with 5 stars would be biased and unfair.   My experience at the buffet started on a sour note because we arrived hungry at 7:20 a.m. but could not dine yet because we needed to redeem our Vegas Slots \"2 for 1\" buffet reward first. This wouldn't have been a problem if the Mlife area where you redeem the coupons didn't open until 8 a.m. After a night of drinking, waiting 40 minutes on an empty stomach---while watching happy diners cheerily stuff their smiling faces at the buffet---was miserable. I was grouchy. If the buffet opens at 7 a.m. and the only place that people can redeem their rewards to eat is at the Mlife station, shouldn't Mlife open at 7 a.m.?   Once my dining partner and I stepped into the buffet, I breathed a sigh of relief. The fruit selection was lovely and every choice was sweet, succulent, and refreshing. MGM surprised me with how fresh their fruit was. One giant plate of honeydew, watermelon, and pineapple slices later, I was ready for the heartier side of breakfast.   I'm not a fan of savory breakfasts so I steered clear from the bacon, eggs, and Mexican offerings. I snagged a bite of my mom's omelette from the made-to-order omelette station, and the two of us agreed that it sucked. It was under-seasoned and just \"blech.\"  I served a big plate of cottage cheese topped with plenty of strawberry compote. The pancakes and waffles looked pretty good and there was a variety of sweet toppings to choose from for your breakfast goods! The cottage cheese and strawberry compote combination was surprisingly excellent. The cottage cheese tasted great with the very fresh, not-too-sweet compote! I ate the same cottage cheese and strawberry compote combination at the Mirage's Cravings buffet the previous day and I'm not sure which buffet served a better compote! I truly enjoyed both.   I also ate a mini apple pastry that was flaky, buttery, fresh, and good enough for seconds and thirds. Perhaps sticking to the sweeter breakfast options is the way to go at the MGM Grand buffet.",

There was no wait at MGM which should have been a hint that the Yelp reviews I had read were accurate.  But we were  determined to go to a buffet to please all the various desires of our group and we had run out of time to find a place that did not require a long wait.   Food was what you would find in a cafeteria and the setting reminded me of eating in a hospital cafe.  Certainly not worth the $40 per person.     Asked for a wine list and was given a little piece of paper with a few wines listed but told the prices were not correct -- we were told the prices  were higher than what was listed but wait person did not know the prices.  Other than not knowing prices for wine, our wait person was very helpful.    I should have  paid attention to the Yelp reviews --I will from now on!!",

I guess having a giant casino and a lot of hungry clients walking out of Ka or just lots of gambling will do it.  It's not that the food is terrible; it's actually fairly decent, and there is a very large selection.  My concern here is why I'm spending $33 for corn dogs, fried chicken, and a do-it-yourself burrito section with dry beef and greasy beans.  You could get those items in a $10 lunch buffet these days.  That being said, it's not like they're completely devoid of decent food.  The day I went, there was a section where a chef will cut you a new york steak or a prime rib.  There was another section for king crab.  The issue here is that those items aren't anything special these days; The Mirage offers those as well for around $25.  Even worse is that the chefs were quite stingy with their meat, cutting me a small piece and telling me to come back later (presumably after stuffing myself with microwavable corn dog bites).  It seems to me that compared to more economical but quality buffets like the one at The Mirage, you're paying about $10 more for a larger selection at MGM Grand Buffet.  But the \"selection\" we're talking about here is crap you could get from Hometown Buffet... hardly something I'd want to waste my time waiting in line for in Las Vegas.  Bottomline: If you're going to spend over thirty bucks for a buffet, go to the Bellagio or Wynn instead.  If you really must eat in MGM, go to one of their restaurants or even their food court with McDonald's.  Avoid the buffet.",

You're exhausted from the night before, dehydrated from not enough water and too much alcohol, and already given into gluttony, so what do you have to lose? Well, your standards and possibly your dignity if you choose the wrong buffet. I have had the good and the bad, and I would say MGM is neither. It's just okay.   On a saturday morning just before noon, I was starving. So starving, that by the time we finally sat down to eat I literally grabbed a plate from the closest food station and filled up a plate with things I couldn't even pronounce. I actually found it quite tasty, so I was curious about what other delicious things were out there. Well, that's where the okay part of it all comes into play. Everything else was just okay. For $25 though, I like a little better than okay. I go to Silverton for $17 and it's AMAZING, so I wasn't impressed by the price.  I was, however, impressed with the pay here kiosks! Instead of waiting in line for eternity you just walk up to the kiosk, get your receipt, and get seated. Done. Simple. I appreciate that.   I would eat here again if it was very convenient or I was starving and couldn't wait, but I don't think I would really plan to eat here.",

    "text": "2.5 stars  My brother-in-law took us to Vegas this past week.  We had never been before, so b-in-law went ahead and planned out an itenerary for us.  We ate at the MGM Grand Buffet on the first night of the trip Monday b/c it was the most convenient (we stayed at MGM Grand Hotel).  Short wait in line (5-10 min).  Cost was upwards of $120 for 2 adults and 2 kids :(  Nice sized selection including American, Mexican, Asian, Italian, and Indian. I liked that they had whole asian pears  Food was very hit or miss.  I would have expected much better quality for the price.  Steamed dim sum dumplings were cold and dried out. Miso soup was devoid of tofu and sooo salty.  Chinese 'rice balls' were awfully dried out and sitting in a thick sauce that was so salty that I could not eat it.  I am the sort of person who has 3-4 different types of specialty salt at home and sometimes even carries my sea salt grinder in my purse, so it is really bad if something is that salty to me! Fried tofu balls were better, lighter and fluffier than any fried tofu that I have previously had elsewhere.  Sesame balls were hot enough for the sesame seeds to be all hot and toasty - yum :)  Desserts selection was pretty decent.  All of the desserts (fruit tarts, custards, etc) that I tried were delicious, though still not quite worth the price...  My favorite part was the asian pear.  My husband does not remember eating anything impressive, but is still grumping about the cost.  My oldest son loved the mints that he got as we were leaving.  All in all, not worth the $$.  For a few bucks less you can get a far superior buffet experience at Wicked Spoon (our fave meal of the trip).",

    "text": "We've had the MGM buffet before, but I remember having better memories of it (possibly because that was about 5 years ago). For $35, I seriously expected much more. To be fair, if you can calculate the cost of crab legs and eat $35 worth of that, you're set but if you consider the general quality and assortment of other items, then for $35, I've definitely had better, both at buffets and non-buffets. Quite frankly, I think we should have just spent our $35/person and eaten at a finer establishment.   Aside from the ubiquitous crab legs and peel-and-eat shrimp (very puny and limp looking), there were: - Smoked salmon, with capers, lemon, and onions - Assortment of cold cuts (e.g. salami) with olives and cheese - Taco bar  - Prime rib - Ham - Turkey breast (I think) - Rolls (lots!) - Pizza (pepperoni, combo, cheese, veggie - overall very bready) - Small salad bar  - Minestrone soup - Miso soup - Black bean soup - Some kind of pressed flat steak, grilled to order - Dim sum (the wrappers on these didn't look right/firm) - Beer-battered fish (big pieces, though the batter looked very dark and thick) - Tempura shrimp (more like battered shrimp than traditional tempura shrimp) - Chinese food (e.g. broccoli beef or something like that) - Mac and cheese - Fried chicken - Four types of sushi (e.g. faux crab meat California rolls) - Fruit - Assorted desserts (cupcakes, beignets, etc. - generally speaking, it was either overly sweet or bland) - Ice cream/soft serve  Honestly, for $35, the MGM buffet is only appropriate for those of you that emphasize quantity over quality. I know I shouldn't expect much from a buffet, but the selection of food (aside from the shrimp and crab legs) is like Sizzlers or Home Town Buffet and both of those charge way less. If this wasn't the MGM, I probably could understand the general lack of quality, but I seriously expected more from the MGM. For those of you that want a buffet in Vegas and didn't care much about the quality, then I would just pick one of the cheaper buffets on the Strip that also includes crab legs and shrimp and call it a day. Of course, if this was discounted or comped with your stay, then by all means, do take advantage of it.",

Bland, boring, really not good food.  I felt like I was on an all-you-can-eat crap-fest.  Trying to choose the least bad thing there.  Looking back, I should have asked for my money back.",

I informed her that I was not yelling and that if I had the whole restaurant would hear it. She then asked others in the line that were told the same thing. The line we were in was NOT MARKED VIP. To say the least I was I so upset that I told my boyfriend that if we were not seated we were going to go back refund the money he spent on the brunch and go somewhere else. When they did seat us we got watered down orange juice! I get watering down drinks but watering down OJ!!!!!!! If I was not staying at the Signature. So far on my vaca I have been to NYNY and MGM Grand and I have been sadly disappointed at both.",

Over priced as are most buffets on the strip these days cost us about $55.00 for an evening mid week dinner which included one kids priced dinner (over $70.00 for 2 adults).  They do discount kids up to age 12 which was good.  There aren't a lot of food selections on the buffet but what we tried was tasty.  The shrimp were deveined and the crab legs were cut which is a plus in my book for any buffet.  But, omg, the desserts are some of the best I've had on any buffet in town.  Not only were the desserts all worthy of consumption the variety was amazing right down to the hand dipped Ha'gen Daz ice cream.   Our server was very nice and kept us filled and cleared.  The whole buffet area was very clean and sparkly.  If they added more quality selections of food this buffet would definitely be the bomb and worth what they charge.  When my son turns 13 in the spring we definitely won't go back though opting for the less expensive Luxor buffet which had very good desserts too, just no Ha'gen Daz.",

They have a lot of good options; soups, salads, seafood, meat, sushi, dumplings, egg rolls, pickled veggies, Mexican food, about 5 flavors of ice cream, a bunch of desserts, fruit &  some other things, theres too much to mention. You can order alcohol for extra cost but soft drinks, juice, ice tea and coffee are included.  We were full and happy. I would love to go there again when ever we're in Vegas.    I suggest you ask to look inside before you pay so you know if thats what you want to eat.",

Some of the seafood was good, but for the most part, this was not a quality buffet at all.  I am writing this over a week after the experience, so I am trying to remember what I didn't like.  The barbecue chicken sauce was too sweet and uninteresting, the chicken was so old it had a chew to it like jerky.   The kung pao chicken was greasy, lukewarm and had very little seasoning.  The smoked salmon was mushy and didn't taste fresh.   I did like the chocolate covered marshmallows at the dessert section.  They only had two, and I ate them both.",

We went there for lunch and it was around $20, plus tax so total around $22/$23. I don't remember the exact prices.   Overall this place is probably better than most buffets in our hometown. They always have fresh food because they have a steady flow of people coming in and out. There's also a wide selection of food.   Don't come here expecting the best buffet ever, but if you are hungry and want a wide selection of food or cant decide on where to eat, this is not a bad place.  The prices aren't cheap but I don't think it is expensive either considering you are in Vegas and probably on vacation. its cheap compared to going to a non-buffet place.",

Upon getting my first three plates of food, my impression is that the food looks subjectively better than it tastes. Many of the menu items were on the colder side and had a stale texture upon eating them. Some entrees such as the stir-fried vegetables had a lack of flavor in them. For the price charged and the content offered, I came up with two stars. The service on the other hand was excellent. Our server delivered refills on our beverages in a timely manner and picked up our used buffet plates so we had more room on the table. The restaurant is also clean though on the point where it counts (the food of course), the meal was below average. If you prefer MGM hotels, I'd recommend Bayside Buffet at Mandalay Bay and The Buffet at the Aria. The experiences there aren't always consistent but felt more satisfied at the end of the meal than I did with MGM's buffet.",

Had them charge the buffet to my room then realized I was like 20th in line. OK after 10 min. wait I was seated. Did a walk around because the buffet is grand in size and did like what I saw, everything looked old and dried out. Asked for a refund and was told NO. I had been seated. Told I could talk with a manager but no one was there and would have to wait.  A guest in line over heard me and asked why I wanted a refund I answered and was then told by the cashier that I could not be up front complaining to other guests that I needed to leave or she would call security. In hindsight I should have had her call security.  Went back to my table decided to eat and wait. FOOD WAS OLD tasting, like it had been on the steam table for hours.",

My wife and I had a BOGO offer which made everything that much more worth it. Our group was seated fast and we were off to the races. Most of us started with their Complimentary Beer/Wine selection. They offered two domestic draft beers and 3 low end wines. They also offer a bigger selection but at a price.                 On to the carving station, no wait! CRAB LEGS! I almost made a crucial mistake. Luckily I was able to correct it before it happened. One massive plate of crab legs please! more.... more.... OK! Thanks! I was told once that crab legs is how you get your money's worth. So I made sure to do so. NOW on to the carving station! Prime Rib or Brisket? both please. The man at the carving station was so friendly and offered advice to which sauces were his favorite. I get back to my table and proceed to continue this amazing and glutinous meal!                  Round three....? I hadn't really gone around the buffet to see what they actually had to offer as i came in knowing the two things i had to get. So as i was just walking around seeing all of the delicious foods i was too full to try, one of their employees walked about asking if i had any questions. I asked him, what his favorite foods were that i should try. He sort of side smiled and asked me to follow him. He introduced me to a chef standing near a huge seafood stand. Telling me he is one of the best chefs the MGM has to offer. The Chef asked me \"do you like everything?\" in which i replied \"of course\". He gave me an acknowledgment of sorts and i knew i was in for a treat. He was like a mad Scientist adding all sorts of seafood, and sauces, and spices. 15 minutes later, my dish is ready. It was massive! Full of swordfish, crab legs, crawfish, shrimp, clams, mussels all of which was sitting in the most amazing creamy broth. I shared the plate with my table and everyone loved it. If i were to return i would probably start with that!               In closing, the buffet food itself was good. None of their food that didn't have someone tending to it directly was anything special. The kicker was the stuff that was being tended to by their incredibly friendly, welcoming staff. They made the experience that much more pleasant. They seemed to care about the food being served to you. Some might not care about things like that but i do. This buffet is absolutely worth trying. Especially if you are able to get the same BOGO offer my wife and i had. One of the best meals we had in all of Vegas.",

    "text": "Considering the price point of the MGM itself and the prices of other restaurants inside and around the MGM, I feel that the MGM buffet is the best value for your money. I spent $15 on some chips and (nonalcoholic) drinks in the hotel essentials shop, so for only $15 more you can have all the food you can eat.    The selection at this buffet obviously isn't anything close to places like Bacchanal or the Wynn buffet, but for $29.99 I think there are several solid options that make it a good spot for dinner if you'd rather not leave the hotel. There are (dungeness) crab legs and prime rib every night, and a reasonable variety of cuisines (Asian, Italian etc.) to choose from. The dessert station includes a soft serve machine and sundae bar. Drinks are self-serve, which is neat because they have the special Coke dispenser that mixes flavors.   Nothing incredible or fancy, but you'll definitely leave with full stomachs and not-entirely-empty wallets.",

We were charged for unlimited Champagne & Mimosas when though she's only 19 and obviously can't drink. The lady when we paid said it's included for brunch. I said we aren't going to use that. Still got charged. Asked the watress at our table, she said everyone gets charged that over 13. I'm confused as the little card on the table says it's a $9 add on. Over $40 after tip for brunch. It would have been at least $85 if I didn't have the coupon.  Now the food. Not the selection I expected by any means. The food is very tasteless. Even the scrambled eggs have no taste. Like none at all. Like how does an egg not taste like an egg?  I'm really trying to find something I'm impressed with. I guess maybe the staff.",

    "text": "Eh. That is the best word that expresses my experience at the buffet at the MGM.   There isn't anything too special at this buffet beside the fact they serve rock crab legs, other than that, the food here is just...there.   Nothing really stood out to me, yeah there was okay brisket and yes there was okay prime rib, but when in Vegas, your expectations are high, especially when it comes to buffets. If this buffet was, let's say in Bay Area, then this would probably be one of the better ones in the Bay. But because it's in Vegas, this ranks as one of the buffets on the bottom of my list. This is probably why the price of this buffet is 40% cheaper than the others.   If I were to describe this buffet in one sentence it would be this: \"food that gets the job done.\" Because this is what this buffet is good for, a place where you can fill your body up. Don't expect a fine buffet experience, go to the cosmopolitan for that.  I would rather take an uber from the MGM to the cosmopolitan and spend that extra $15-20 to eat at the wicked spoon because its worth it. Take my word for it.",

    "text": "I had the buffet twice during my stay at MGM, once for brunch and dinner. It's around $30 per meal, depending what day you go and the specific meal. I thought $30 was fair for the variety of food and the overall quality. The line can get pretty long around brunch time. I tried going around 9am for brunch and the line to pay and to get seated was way too long. If you go at an odd hour, say 7am for brunch you'll probably get in quick.   Service was nice. They do a good job at picking up your plates when you leave the table. That always seems to be a problem at buffets, but not here.   On to the food! The brunch food was pretty disappointing in comparison to dinner. The bacon was soggy and the powdery scrambled eggs were just... not eggs. I noticed they had an omelette station but I'm not the biggest fan of omelettes. I probably should have just gotten made to order eggs, which I suggest you do if you want \"real eggs.\" I didn't really try any of the lunch items but they had a decent assortment of salads, pastas, potatoes, and meats. My brunch experience was pretty meh and I would highly recommend just coming for dinner.  Dinner was great! It might have been because it was my first night in Vegas and the excitement was just oozing out of me but the dinner was awesome. They have such a huge selection during the dinner time from sushi, to grilled fish, SEAFOOD!!!, prime rib, pastas, roasted potatoes, veggies, and the list goes on and on. The seafood was probably my favorite part. Their fresh shrimp and mussels was actually good! You can definitely judge a buffet place by their seafood and MGM's seafood was good. They have an area where you can get your seafood cooked. I got some steamed crab legs and this was delicious. You can even add a garlic butter sauce to your cooked seafood. This was the highlight of my meal and made it all worth it.   MGM offers a decent buffet, a bit more affordable than others, and the food as a whole is solid!",

    "text": "I generally don't like making reviews so soon after going some place; I prefer to stew around, ask others in the party what they thought, and try to make a well rounded review ... you know, be all pretentious about it.  But, after having dinner here last night and having an extra hour or so while the rest of the family goes off to gamble, I had to vent my disgust with the Grand Buffet here at the MGM Grand.  First off, dinner on a weeknight costs upwards of $39.99 a person, which makes the buffet here one of the pricier ones on the strip.  For comparison, the Wynn and Cosmopolitan charge a buck less on weeknights ($38.99), the Bellagio charges $36.99, and, just to throw it in there, one of my preferred Vegas buffets at the Rio is a scant $32.99 per adult.  So, the MGM charges more than the newer and swankier places in Vegas.  And what do you get for that extra cost?  The short answer is nothing to make it worth it.  When I come to buffets, I don't expect anything more than a lot of average fare.  Typically, you can hope to find most things be not too disgusting, with one or two items that jump above the line, and an equal number than dive well below it.  Here, everything feels dried out from too much time under the heat lamps, meats are under seasoned or overcooked, breads are stale or oddly chewy, and then a couple of high points.  Starting with the carving station, the steaks are flavorless, with no char from the grill, no salty melt to the beef, and most everything we had filled with gristle.  The ribs were overcooked, the fatty trim burned to dry coarseness that was akin to bad chicharrones.   The Prime Rib was overcooked, no pink, close to over seasoned (why couldn't they sprinkle some of that on everything else?), and sharing those ribbons of gristle that ruined the steaks before them.  And, finally, those kielbasas ... well, they were just bad.  The Mexican / Latin station had a bad rendition of Carnitas, which were overly laden with unnecessary vegetables instead of flavoring them with just whatever acid they broke down the protein with and the simmer from cooking it down in its own salty fat.  And the pizza ... my toddler son who normally loves such things, wouldn't even touch it.  On the average end of the scale, the Brussel Sprouts were alright, a bit tough as they didn't seem to be steamed to soften up before roasting, but were also coated in the strong, acrid taste of fennel.    The sushi station was on point for a typical buffet, though not for a $40 a plate one.  They had Octopus Nigiri, an atypical selection, and had a good chew to it along with a fair flavor that didn't have an overly fishy taste.  Salmon rolls had jalapeno slivers with nice heat.  But, on the flip side, no California Rolls or any normal sushi fare you would expect to enjoy.  Macaroni Cheese was fair, tasting fresher than out of the box, and good enough for parents to bite and enjoy while kids feasted on it.  And over at the Asian station, the Egg Rolls were average, if not common / everyday.  Pot stickers are poorly made, none of them cooked down long enough for the skins to become gummy and firm like they should have been, but they still were pretty good, even if they readily fell apart.  And Fried Rice is almost always good.  On the high end, the Shrimp Diablo was fantastic, a good cut to the shellfish, perfectly cooked, and served in a wine sauce with fair heat that was really outstanding.  And the Pear and Gorgonzola Ravioli were a nice blend of sweet and salty, well cooked, and sauced in, what I remember being, a butter cream that made it my favorite dish of the night.  Oh, and their dessert is pretty standard, not quite worth the price tag, but still a good representation of what you should see at a higher end Vegas buffet on the strip.  Plus, they have Ghirardelli sauces!  So, in the end, more disappointments than readily edible food.  Nothing was horrendous, but none of it truly stood out in amazement that came anywhere near warranting the $40 price tag.  I think the greatest mark against this place is all of the poor Yelp reviews that have been tagged by MGM management with their thanks and promise of review ... yet, none of these slights seemed to have been improved in any way whatsoever!  Anyway, if you dropped the cost down to $25 on a weeknight, it might be a solid three stars.  As of right now, it's a very weak two stars in my eyes.",

Very little on the buffet looked edible.  I ate the following: lettuce and salad dressing (the toppings looked extremely mushy), watermelon, prime rib, and crab legs.  Saying I ate this is even a stretch.  It was very difficult to get a piece of meat large enough to actually eat.  They were the smallest crab legs I've ever seen.  The claws were smaller than my thumb, and I don't have very big thumbs.  My first piece of prime rib was fine, the second looked like a shoe so I didn't bother trying to eat it.  The only desert worth eating was the ice cream.  Biggest waste of $50 I experienced in Las Vegas.",

When I arrived at the buffet there was several lines trying to figure if it was for players cards when I got closer it was the number in groups to single persons . The cashier's were very good getting people taken care of and sales done .   I was directed over to a side cashier that welcomed me asking me if I wanted to go in and to check out the food if I would like . She told that they are still serving breakfast and also lunch together . I told her that this was my first time here I would like one for breakfast which I paid 23.90 that was a good price .     The sales cashier was very nice was met by a seating person that directed table seating found me a good area that was close to the buffet . I went through and looked the many dishes that the buffet serves many dishes were presented nice and others that were food dumped in the pan .     Dishing up corned beef hash and sausage and the and country for biscuits had very good flavor and cooked all the way . Going back to getting mashed potatoes and Mac and cheese when I saw the potatoes they were floating butter to much .    When I finished my breakfast I wanted try the deserts yet noticing a kitchen worker going through pushing food in the water under the trays not correctly cleaning . When I saw that I requested to speak with the general manager I explained about the manager .     I told the manager that many places I have been to presentation and cleanliness I look for and customers look for . If I had the time I would come back and try again what I saw was uncalled for . My recommendation of the buffet it doesn't meet what a buffet should stand for and yet the floor people that seat people did incredible job .",

I really like that Hi-C orange is available from the fountain drink dispenser.  I didn't like so much that the drinks were self serve.

Food: good  Table Service: what? there are servers? Food Servers: awesome & friendly Cooks: friendly Value: not worth the price I paid for the service I didn't get & the attitude I had to put up with from the table servers   I thought about what I'd have to do if I ever brought my lil one to this particular buffet without anyone else and how worried I'd be to leave her sitting at the table by herself if I had to go to the drink area. I know that I sound like a paranoid parent but let's face it, it's not safe out there for a kiddo.    I was seated in a section where the 2 servers didn't seem all that interested in tending to their guests.  I figured, even if they don't pay much attention to me, at least I couldn't really see myself needing much of anything. And that ended up being the case.  I ate a small plate of veggies, a salad and some fish.  I went to get a few things that I'd wanted to try and I felt I'd missed.  I left my 1st plate on the table. I walked to the buffet line to get my 2nd plate.  When I came back to my table, my 1st plate was still there. Hmm. That should not have been the case when those 2 female servers were still there, chatting away about their families and what they did over the weekend. Ummm... HELLO????   Nobody asked me if I needed anything.  I went to get another drink. When I came back my receipt was gone from my table top.  When I'd asked them if I needed my receipt they told me no.  Hmm, that was odd.  When I looked around, all the other tables had their receipts clearly displayed on the tops of their drink menu stands.  I had to ask why all the other tables had their receipts but I didn't. It made me wonder if these two seemingly lazy servers hadn't gotten to all these other tables to collect their receipts or if they collected mine for some other reason.  I asked for a copy of my receipt.  When they asked me why I needed it, I explained to them that I wanted a copy for my own records. I should NOT have had to explain myself. I wanted to complain so much but I didn't have the time or the energy.    I had already not been feeling well, before having gone to the buffet.  I knew I needed to eat something.  So, I went there with the idea that I'd have a nice dinner and that I'd retire to my room early for the evening.    Note to self, next time do NOT leave a tip until after my full dining experience.  Ugh!    The few things that I liked about the buffet were that some of the food servers at the different stations were really friendly.  The meat carving stations had some real awesome folks working there.  The fish and chips were probably my favorite that I've ever had at any other Vegas buffet.  They were not only fresh but I could really appreciate that they were small in size because it didn't make the fish seem real heavy or anything.  It was just good.  I had a hard time finding tartar sauce but I managed.  Some of the other items that I really liked included the steamed veggies, the Brussel sprouts, salad bar and a number of the other entree offerings. I, sadly, didn't care for anything at the dessert line.  I might give this buffet another shot in the future but I really hope that I am treated with more respect and that I'm not so heavily questioned when I ask for my receipt.  I'd really like to bring my family here. And so, again, I do hope that things turn out better the next time I'm there. . . because I know for a fact, I wasn't pleased that my dishes weren't removed for a lengthy time. I wasn't pleased that I just hadn't been made to feel real welcome or appreciated at all.   Oh and in case you were wondering, my dishes weren't picked up from my table until well after I'd returned from picking up a cookie and cake piece. I wanted to ask for tea but who knows how long that would have taken. Forget it.",

They had several brunch options from cheesey grits, to bagels and lox. Most of the food was tasty, and unlimited mimosas was a nice touch, but at $65 for two people I think you can find better in LV for cheaper.  The wait staff are very nice and clean off tables quickly. Unfortunately nothing too special to report about the brunch buffet.",

The jambalaya omelet was dry and tasteless. There was not a single dish that appealed to my eyes and was mouth watery.  The waitress was always asking us how we are doing and if she could take the plates away. Friendly and nice. The other workers there looked bored and not wanting to be there. Workers should always be pleasant and learn to smile. Customers notice this and get turned off when workers are not in a good mood. People serving the food bring in the customers too, not just the food.   Brunch weekend buffet was priced at $30 per adult while the weekend dinner buffet priced at $40 per adult.   Buffets are a hit or miss.",

That's how memorable the first time was. The food isnt terrible, it can be good depending what you pick. $42 for dinner. It comes with variety that can help difficult decisions of where to eat for a big group.  It's also kind of slim pickings inside MGM. Unless you want wolf gang puck but then again, you wont have as much variety.  I wont catch myself here a third time. This time I yelped this place to remind me I've been here. Again, not terrible quality. It just makes you feel sad during and after to try and get your money's worth...",

    "text": "I must say I was very disappointed in this Buffet.  I always come to a Buffett when I am in Vegas 3-4 times per year.  I was really looking forward to it today, but it was a big let down.  Came here for the dinner Buffett, expecting Crab legs and the usual variety of items at most Buffets.  The selection was very limited, they had an entire section closed and 1/3 of the Buffet was empty.  They even advertise that they have crab legs when you look at their site, but no dice.  The prime rib was either too raw or way over cooked, brisket was good on one half and terribly chewy and fat on the other half, much more than normal, so much so I could not eat it at all.  Sushi was bland, Chinese food was not good either.   Seafood stew was mostly shells and all one flavor.  Hard to find some highlights here I am sorry to say.  The deserts are very limited which after a subpar meal I was looking forward to a good desert, but not even that was what you would expect, especially the MGM Grand Buffet.    Stay away from the \"Roasted Peppers\" it says spicy, which I love spicy food and typically when a place says spicy, it is not to me, but man these are HOT !  I think there may be ghost peppers in there, not sure, but I could not eat for 5 minutes waiting for the burn to go away, uncomfortable.  Here are the good points, The fried chicken was actually very good, they had peeled shrimp  cocktail and the buttered corn was very flavorful.  With that said, all three of these would be really hard to mess up.  They dinner also comes with unlimited beer and wine which is a bonus and probably the best thing for the money.  I would save your money here and choose a different buffet, this one is more expensive than many and not worth the money.  You can find much better Buffets for 1/3rd to half the price.  If you do decide to try it out and if you have the my Konami Slots game that gives you perks for MGM properties using Mlife.  Make sure you get a free buffet, or at least 2 for 1 buffet.  My recommendation would be to skip it all together though.  Enjoy!",

Especially around Dinner time  Overall a NOT very impressive Buffet. It's not a BAD Buffet but paying $45 a buffet per person (Dinner) isn't worth it unless you go ham on the unlimited Coors and Miller Lite. There are much BETTER options on the Strip at a better price point.   My recommendation: SKIP THE BUFFET. Enjoy a delicious Steak at the CraftSteak down the hallway. NEVER SETTLE FOR CHEAP MEATS",

    "text": "Formally called, \"The Oz Buffet,\" the MGM Buffet is a step lower than the Bellagio, Wicked Spoon, and Bachannal Buffet.  To me, it looks like an upscale Hometown Buffet with premium eats.    I bought a comp buffet pass from playing MyVegas and decided to give it a try since I'm always eating in the pricey buffets. The Buffet is located right on the left side of the casino by the strip entrance and across from Rain Forest Cafe.  My buffet pass was only good for lunch and I made it a mission to make it all the way from the Cosmopolitan on time before they switched to dinner. =D  The food they serve here is typical in any other Vegas Buffet, like: Italian, Asian, Mexican, Seafood, Meat Station, Middle Eastern, and Japanese. Overall the food was just average and the customer service was on top of it's game. The surroundings weren't fancy or eye catching, just plain boring. No, \"Wow Factor\" at all.  I expected better from MGM, since it's one of the biggest hotels in the Las Vegas and the world. They need to step up their game or they'll just end up being mediocre, like the Excalibur and Luxor Buffets. I'd sure eat here again, only if it were free.",

I was not expecting anything great, but should be good at least. For $21 (lunch) you would think so. It has been over 10 years since I have been to Vegas and I honestly think the Excalibur from back then had more food choices than  MGM. Carving station was minimal. Salad was non-existent compared to most other buffets. The buffet stations seemed plentiful until you walk up to it. Basically, they spread out the food giving you the illusion  of lots of choices base on the length of the buffet bar. Their coke machine had more choices than this buffet. On the plus side, the staff seemed genuinely friendly and helpful. The food they did have was above average but not enough to rate more stars.",

Honestly, my expectations weren't that high because of the look of the place as compare to other buffets I've visited in Las Vegas and it was free. Hotels in Las Vegas don't give away the highest quality for free, I'm just saying.   That being said, we went for lunch. It was just OK as expected. Some items were better than others but overall, the food was very cafeteria-ish, not gourmet.   The staff were excellent, I must say. Very attentive and pleasant.",

Other than that, save your money and try something else.  Plenty of better buffets in my opinion that are better.  Great customer service but just not that good for that price.

We had a few things - the mashed potatoes were really good, and waited for the lunch buffet to begin. We were hoping for the seafood extravaganza the signs promised. When it finally arrived, it was frozen then fried shrimp that was mostly breading around tiny shrimp and cold crab legs that had been frozen and defrosted. I mean, I could squeeze the water out of them and drip it on my plate. Pretty gross. The best part was the bottomless mimosas and the really nice bartender, Steve.  He made the visit suck a lot less. I wouldn't recommend this place at all. There are too many other buffets to waste your money here. It's called the Grand Buffet, but there's nothing grand about it.",

My childhood encounters with Ryan's, Golden Corral and Ponderosa became a thing of the past when my penny-pinching father started to loosen his wallet for the likes of Texas Roadhouse (eat as many rolls and peanuts as you can pre-ordering/meal). Yet, on my first visit to Vegas, it only seemed appropriate that we experience a classic casino buffet.  Penny-pinching papa deemed MGM's \"to be one of the best\" (code language for: \"it's the only one I remember from my last Vegas visit). We humored him and played along - $35 per person...for a buffet. All I could think to myself was...hmm... what does a $35 booffet include? Personal filets? A to-die-for cheese board with international cheeses like Manchego and the finest Gruyere? (fully aware that I'm sounding snobby right now, just play along).   The buffet lacked the experience I had hoped for - it felt like more of a cruise ship feeding trough than a sit down and enjoy the meal atmosphere.  Maybe it was the lighting? Or the floorplan and style of cheap tables and chairs? Let's call Vegas the City of Gluttony (replacing \"Sin City\")- in hopes of describing that Icouldhavewornsweatpantstothisbuffet brainwave that I couldn't seem to push out of my mind.  The chefs used butter like it was going out of style and by the end of the meal my empty veggie plate looked like the remains of a buttah swimming pool. Meal highlights included the blueberry panna cotta shooters, grilled asparagus, wild rice salad with cranberries and carrots and the smile on my tickled father's face. (Please don't tell him about this review;) The moral of the story: My father was quite pleased with his \"one of the best\" buffet experiences and we were able to fill our stomachs on once-healthy, now-buttery veggies.",

The crab legs were too salty, smoked salmon was not really smoked, shrimp (for cocktail) was puny.  Don't need to say anymore.",

    "text": "I'm surprised by the low rating for the MGM Grand Buffet. Sure, it's insanely overpriced, like every other place in Vegas, but the food was good and there was a large selection of items.   In particular, I was impressed with the assortment of meats. From the carving table you could chose turkey breast (moist and delicious!), prime rib (amazing!) and tri-tip (decent but not my favorite). There was also made to order steaks and crab legs for the seafood lovers.   In the middle sections, there were a variety of side dishes. My personal favorites were the mac and cheese (very cheesy and so much better than any other buffet mac and cheese that I've ever tasted) and roasted potatoes.   The salad bar was small for a buffet but I guess paying the higher prices, you'd want to fill up on other things anyway.   My friends all gushed about the dessert bar but seeing as my sweet tooth is barely existent, it didn't entice me. There were quite a few choices for those that do like desserts though.  Thankfully, my friend and I received a $75 food credit for staying at the MGM and that pretty much covered the Friday dinner buffet. If I were to come back on my own dime, I would definitely try the lunch buffet, which is almost half the price.",

There was a somewhat long line to get in, good sign for a restaurant. Not a super fancy ambiance, but was nice for casual dining. We had a $50 food credit because they messed up our room, so it saved us a lot of money. We came on a Sunday for brunch. The only big negative was I hated walking through the super smoke  filled casino to get to the restaurant. Delicious food though and once inside the air was fresh. I wish I was eating there right now :)",

The buffet price is among the higher priced buffets in Vegas but the food is simply average, nothing more,  nothing less.  The variety is lacking and some of the food just isn't good.    The servers are good here they keep your glasses filled and are quick to remove your plates. I also do have to say that I love the coffee at MGM I'm not sure what brand it is or who makes it but it's always super smooth.   If you are staying at the MGM and want a buffet this is the easiest thing for you. If you want a buffet, there are so many in Las Vegas I recommend skipping this one and trying one of the many others out there.",

In that case we can check out and go back to the buffet line without any rush running to the hotel reception just to beat the check out time. But no....., the buffet cashier just looked at me as I was an idiot completely shoot me \"No\" to my face after  I explained to them.My 8 year old daughter and I have go back to the long line waiting for paid for the buffet. After that she had to stay in the buffet along for I had to rush to check out. What kind of service is it? We were not trying to skip any lines just trying to beat the check out deadline.

I did go for breakfast so maybe dinner is different but I thought it was an okay buffet. Especially for what you pay for it was only $18 a person which for what you get it's not too bad! You get your own drinks which was different but we also liked it because we didn't feel we had to tip too excessively. Overall it was a decent buffet (again for the price.) Wish it would have included at least one mimosa or something but other than that I don't have a complaint!",

The food is what you'd expect at most buffets, an assortment of fruits, chicken, fish and other proteins and vegetables and while they are nothing special, they are all cooked well and fresh.  For a buffet, the MGM more than met my expectations and since they normally give all guest at least one free meal at the Grand Buffet, I think it is well worth a visit.",

I am glad i didn't spend $86 of my own money. This buffet needs more kid friendly food. My daughter had fried chicken, slice of pizza, vegetables, salad.   As I walked around the buffet, I noticed they had minimal selections of food. The woman working the carving station in charge of the prime beef, turkey, and sausage seemed brand new! I watched her cut slices of prime rib, they would splash onto the cutting board & the juice from the meat splattered over 2 customers onto their clothes. The prime rib was under cooked, the turkey slices were cut too thick, & were dry.   I ventured over to where the crab legs & shrimp were located. The crab legs looked decent, but I didn't have any. The shrimp .... Oh my goodness ... I can't believe this hotel served this fishy, smelly, old shrimp to their patrons. The shrimp was brown, smelled really horrible, & had white dots on it ... (Please see the picture of the old shrimp I uploaded) ! I know what OLD shrimp looks like & they had a whole big tray full of it ... People were grabbing them by the spoonfuls ... Ick I was getting ill !   The desserts were decent. They have a delicious Oreo cheesecake, chocolate cupcake, and carrot cake. The servers wait staff was pleasant, but didn't attend to us very much.   Would we come back here for bland food & old shrimp ..... NO thank you.",

In the other breakfast area they had potatoes and Portuguese sausage.   I then found the salmon lox, capers, onion and made a killer croissant sandwich. No bagels? Finished up with some fresh fruit and Greek yogurt.   A lot of stuff looks good, but it wasn't according to my friends. There aren't any high end items like prime rib, crab legs, or lamb.

With 50-60 different entrees at any given time, some will be near empty, or will have been on the floor too long, and will need refreshing.  We hit the buffet for dinner, and were very happy with what we saw and tasted.  I made about three trips to the hot crab leg station, and encountered fresh and delicious crab legs every time.   The craving station had prime rib, turkey, and sausages with an assortment of toppings for the meat.  I also tried the mexican station, featuring chicken faijitas.   The beans looked a little stale, but as I was spooning out the chicken, a fresh batch was promptly put in.  The one time I went by the Italian station, the pastas looked a little tired, but I imagine, like everything else, that they were changed out and constantly freshened up.  The service is very good, and the desserts are amazing.  The dessert bar earns an extra star for the assortments of desserts, along with the numerous toppings for the self serve ice cream.  It appears there are some campaigns against this buffet, but this one is pretty good for all the MGM resort buffets.  Don't be scared off by the haters.   We almost were, but we were glad we went.",

Nothing was out of the ordinary incredible or unique, but I thoroughly enjoyed the food.",

When I eat a buffet, I only eat the expensive stuff because you need to get your money's worth. I can't help it. Asian. :P  So I had a whole plate full of crab legs and shrimp. I had some minor stuff but come on... seafood is overpriced. Crab is hard to get. :P   SERVICE: Nice service.   SELECTION: Very little. They had some meats but in all honesty... it's not bad. If you're like me, crab legs are the way to go. They also had pasta and pizza stuff but not the good quality kind. :P  The dessert selection was one table and it was pretty tasty. The ice cream sucks but the baked stuff and cute cup stuff was good!   BATHROOM: Outside of buffet  OVERALL: Meh, take it or leave it. We were desperately hungry.",

The only reason we went here is because we had free vouchers from the hotel. If we would have had to pay for this, we would have been severely disappointed. We waited in line for 20 minutes while there were many open tables. Everything we tried was terrible and we felt that we wasted so much food from everything we didn't eat.  The best thing we had was the soft serve ice cream which is hard to mess up. Second best was the salad bar that we created ourselves from the ingredients available. Terrible items tried: pizza, brisket, ground beef nachos, kielbasa (the absolute worst! Couldn't even choke it down), the lasagna, garlic bread...you get the picture I'm sure. With all that Vegas and the MGM Grand has to offer, I wouldn't bother making this a stop during your stay.",

    "text": "Nice, food was good and fresh, was definitely better quality than the Monte Carlo buffet we went to the day prior, but is soooooooooooooooooo overpriced. Just...f*cking ridiculously overpriced, came to over $60 for my wife and I to have breakfast here.  Also, the line is insanely long to get in, they have some machines you can use your credit card at (which we did) which did at least help speed things along, but the hostesses who were seating people were some cranky old b*tches that really shouldn't be working in the public.  For the breakfast buffet, there wasn't an insane amount of choice, standard breakfast items (pancakes, eggs, sausage, thin/gross bacon, cereal), but their fruit was really good, and everything did seem really fresh so I don't fully regret it. We had a meal credit at the MGM so figured we'd be all-right, didn't know it would wind up costing that much though, would be even higher if they were more reasonably priced. If you plan on going here, make sure you have a coupon or something, not worth the full price, but might be worth it at about half the cost.  Also, the seating area is a little tight, lots of doucebags leave their chairs too far out and have shit stockpiled around their tables, which made it difficult to navigate back to our table. Also would have been much happier if they didn't always have some ridiculously long line to get in.",

    "text": "2.5-3 Stars is pretty accurate for this buffet. $40 Dinner Buffet on Tuesday Night.  My family and I were staying at the MGM Hotel so it was easy for us to come here for an early dinner before our flight back home. There was no wait and we were seated very quickly by the dessert section. I have eaten here twice now, but forgot that I had tried it before until I roamed the different food stations.  From what I can remember, starting from the left side of the buffet, there is a: Taco station where you can build your own fajita/soft taco,  Italian station with things like lasagna, ravioli, chicken parm. (which I really liked) Fruit Station: cantaloupe, watermelon, pineapple Seafood: Crab Legs, mussels, smoked salmon, shrimp Chinese: Egg rolls, etc. Salad: Make your own salad American: fried chicken, mashed potatoes, mac & cheese, corn Sushi: Few different variety Mexican: Enchilada, Tostado, Chimichanga Meat Carving station Dessert Station  What was interesting was that I think there were at least 2 or 3 different areas where you could grab tortilla chips (with nacho cheese, guac, salsa, etc) - that must be a hit with diners.  *I said it in my other review for the Cravings buffet but I will also write here that I am a bit biased because of how much I love the Bachannal buffet - hard for others to compare",

Didn't try the Mexican but it was just tacos. Sushi was ok, rice a little dry. The salad bar area isn't too bad actually, I liked one of the pasta salad with peas.

I felt like it was a good buffet and I wouldn't mind returning here in the future if I had the munchies.   By the way, their waffles are really good. Especially if they have a small hole in the center where you syrup can accidentally seep into and basically turn itself into a syrup filled waffle. AHHH SO GOOD!

They have: - salads and greens  - hot food (pizza, mac&cheese, asian noodles, chicken, ok the standard buffet food options) - fruits section - pastries section with toaster to toast your ish (muffins, scones, bagels, etc) - small selection of sushi - mexican-style food section - omelettes made on-order - grilled meat section - for brunch they had the whole waffles, pancakes, and all that section - They have a separate dessert area which isn't too extravagant but its doable  You can choose between soda, champagne, or mimosas with no extra charge. (the mimosas weren't that great though)  Overall I would definitely come here again!",

For an additional $15 dollars I think you can get unlimited cocktails.   Beer and wine is already included in the regular buffet price. The cocktails are good, and not to weak, so it's a good deal. These are the cocktails that are on the list:  Strawberry margarita (good, came with salt around the rims) Bloody Mary Whiskey Sour (I got this and it was way to strong for me) Peach Bellini Tequila sunrise I think there are a few more, but I don't recall what they were.   You get a wristband if you get the cocktails. You can only get one cocktail at a time, but that excludes beer and wine, so you can order two drinks at once if one of them is beer or wine-:) lol.   I got my husband wine a few times. The line was a little long for the drinks sometime, so go there when no one is around even if you already have a drink. There was only one guy there making the drinks.   As for the food, they had made to order steaks and steamed crab legs. My husband has no shame. He got there before the the crowd formed and told the chef to just give him three steaks now as he'll just be back for more later, lol. The chef laughed. He gave me a piece of it and it was good. I got the crab legs but they weren't that good. They had shrimp there too. There is a carving stations there for sausages and other meats, but I didn't try that. I should've.  They also have a lot of Asian food there. The chow mein and fried rice ran out fast. The orange chicken was good too. I also liked the garlic bread. There is a large selection of drinks there. You serve yourself at this place. The desserts are good. I tried the frozen yogurt, the strawberry cheesecake, and the chocolate pecan bar.   I'm surprised that I didn't even get that buzzed after three or four drinks . Maybe I ate to much for the alcohol to affect me, idk. I ate to much good food there and now I gained a few pounds, ugh! I'm eating healthy again. so I can loose some weight. They don't have that much selection at the salad bar, but when you're at a buffet, are you really even going to eat much salad? lol. Salad is everyday food, not vacation food IMHO, lol.  Oh, and don't try to cut in front of people. Especially my husband. One guy tried to do that and he almost got a plate full of food spilled on him, lol. My husband is super fast, lol He was like oooppss...lol!",

If you have Mlife Gold status you don't have to wait in line too long and you can get right to work eating yourself into a food coma.",

Probably the only great things are the salad and fruit, but not worth paying buffet price for that. I tried to find something to make the price worth it, but there was nothing at all. Even the items that look good in presentation turned out to be a disappointment after you taste them. Desserts are just sugary and generic store bought poor quality. Mimosas are unlimited but you have to get up and stand in a line for pours. They never refilled the shrimp while we were there for 2 hours waiting.",

I came with my family and with some friends for dinner on Wednesday, May 31, 2017 around 8:30 p.m. There wasn't a line at all and we were seated quickly. They did have food from American, Asian, Mexican, and dessert.   All I ate there was: - California Sushi Rolls - Fried Chicken - Orange Chicken - Slices of turkey with gravy - Swirl Ice Cream  The food here was alright. They didn't have that much good food for me to eat. Also seems the food was not fresh at all. Some of the hot  food was dry. Very disappointed. This buffet has the self serve drinks of Coka Cola Freestyle soda machine, coffee, and hot teas.  As for the staff here, they were not happy to work there. Some of them didn't have a welcoming happy face. They did however did their jobs. The server for our table just takes our finished dishes out of our table.  I recommend to eat somewhere else. On our dinner night, each person is about $43 each person. Not worth it. Eat somewhere else that is much fancier, nicer staff, and better food.",

I can't imagine paying 32.00 per person to eat there. People save your money and spend the extra 6.00-8.00 per person and eat at the buffet at the Wynn or Aria or anywhere else.

Unfortunately, even drinking large amounts of Hennessy could make this place stand out.   As I was craving Chinese and the BF was craving Sushi this was our second choice.   What can I say? It's your typical buffet with the  typical offerings: sushi, seafood, Chinese, pizza, nachos, carving station and desserts. Beverage choices include fountain drinks, beer, wine and $10 more can get you mixed drinks.   Nothing stood out here that would make me return. I had the Chinese offerings, ratatouille (probably the best dish here), crab (warm), shrimp(prepared for you warm) long wait, 20 mins! They also offered crawfish boil but the crawfish was terrible as it was either over cooked or previously frozen. I had many other items but like I said nothing stood out.   Service was good (waiter kept encouraging us to drink the beer and wine) 2 stars for her!   For $93.07 for dinner for two we could have enjoyed another dinner at Emeril's. Would I return here? No. Not worth the money or the wait in line.",

The only reason it even deserves one star is because the crab legs were tasty and already cut in half making it easy to eat.  Other than that the food was very bland; mussels were not very good, shrimp ceviche was sub-par, NY strip had no flavor, prime rib was cooked to medium well (way too done for prime rib), sushi rolls were not even worth eating, even the grilled vegetable tasted like they had no salt or pepper use.  The only other thing worth mentioning was the grilled sausage, it was rather tasty.  The service was horrible.  I waited 15 minutes before one of the people seating came over to me and said \"I see you have not been served a drink yet.\"  Then when I emptied it, the waitress walked by the table and grabbed my dirty dishes and never returned to fill the drink.  I ate the plate of food that I just got (crab legs) and then had to go to the back and ask a \"bus\" lady for a drink.  Never again!",

For the price they charge I was hoping to at least have decent pizza or maybe a good fried chicken, all of the food was bland w absolutely no flavor and in many instances as if their cooks aren't even trying to add flavor. The desserts were ok and didn't do anything for my palette.  I guess they are hoping since it's the only buffet inside this casino that you would settle but believe me you are better off eating at one of the chain restaurants at the food court then wasting your money inside this tasteless atrocity.

With a name such as \"Grand\" Buffet, I expected to have a large selection of different food, but unfortunately selections were limited. I honestly found myself filling my stomach with plates full of mac and cheese. The quality of food was okay but the crab legs and seafood just wasn't what I expected.   The one thing that saved this fiasco of a dinner buffet was the dessert section. This section, yet small and secluded, offered some tasty pastries and desserts that I actually enjoyed. Now this wasn't amazing, but it did help me feel better about spending money on this buffet.  I must say that one good thing about this buffet is that it was kept clean and was well maintained. The staff was also fast at giving us refills and clearing our tables of plates and silverware. So overall, my experience with the service was good, but the ambiance and atmosphere was filled with noises from the casino.  I honestly must say that I will probably never go back again unless I receive a free buffet pass. But other than that, I think I'll just have to pass.",

Food was poorly prepared Some items didn't tates right  (either bland or just straight up nasty) Did I mention over priced? Limited desert station served only soft serve ice cream, chocolate mouse, and creme brulee.  This has to be the worst buffet I've ever eaten at.

So we hoofed it all the way to the opposite end and was shocked that it was $39.99 per person.  By that point, we were kind of stuck so we paid it.  But the food was very good with lots of choices.  The carving station had 3 different types of beef which is unusual, along with turkey and kielbasa.  The carver didn't seem to understand English well, those of us getting meat had to point to what we wanted.  There were self-serve beverage stations on each end of the room, along with a small bar.  I had a glass of wine, which was okay and only cost $6.00.  Overall, it was a decent buffet, just overpriced but then, many of them are now.  The Strip in general hikes the prices up for the tourists, forgetting that many locals would go there more if it was reasonable.",

My lunch ended up being a a slice of highly salty ham, a couple of pieces of fried chicken, a few pieces of bland broccoli, and a some California roll.  The lox was suspiciously fishy, and there the only dessert that looked appealing was some ice cream.  This was the cheapest meal of my trip, but also the least enjoyable.",

    "text": "I remember this buffet from 4 years ago, when it was excellent.  In a pinch, we took some friends to the MGM buffet, WITHOUT CHECKING YELP FIRST -- dumb dumb dumb dumb.  I was embarrassed at what we found at the $27/person MGM Friday dinner buffet.  The \"sushi\" on offer consisted of one old-looking platter of krab-salad rolls and one platter of old-looking krab-california rolls.  Their use of krab (pollock) product in these rolls was puzzling because right next door was a huge tray of cold crab legs.  (these legs were fine).  One entire row (of 4) consisted of salad and fruit (yay for healthy choices, but this can all be obtained from a grocery store and was clearly offered as a \"space filler\").    I walked in HUNGRY but the buffet was so visually unappealing that I only half-filled a plate with this and that and was disappointed to find the taste matched the lackluster appearance of each offering.  I'm sure the fruit was great, but that's more of a snack item for me.  After 3 unsuccessful sorties of trying this and that (potato halves with little pasta balls, a fish dish, a beef rib with over-salty gravy, some rock hard rolls, noodles) (none recommended), I resorted to eating some old-looking (and old-tasting) potstickers and some nasty orange-glazed chicken.  My request of the server for some chili sauce?  Denied: \"we only have the 4 sauces you see on your table.\"  (had to catch her in the bussing station to bother her with this request since she was generally not seen during our visit)  Oh, and while we're on service, it matched the overall experience.  Perhaps we just got a bad attendant, but really, her only job is to keep drinks full and plates cleared.  No-Can-Do & No-Can-Do.  My low opinion of the food was verified by my buddy.  Though he politely pretended the food was fine, I could see that he was not finishing many of the items he chose for his plate.  This coming from a guy who is known to eat PLAIN, COLD, PASTA for lunch.  The man has no taste buds and he wouldn't even eat this crap.  Dessert: not good, most selections went unfinished at our table.  The COFFEE, however deserves mention: excellent.  Last rant: who are these other people eating here?  Looks like some free coupons were given out so MGM would have a lower trash bill from tossing all this food into a dumpster.  Think trying-to-be-classy <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.peopleofwalmart.com&s=9c23d4d4a945dd9b9e69b25500392605e33f18cd2b7b0a70769436cadb4b0ce6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">peopleofwalmart.com</a> meets strip buffet.    Total and unmitigated thumbs down.  Good lesson to always check <a href=\"http://yelp.com\">yelp.com</a> first, because all these other reviews say basically the same thing.",

I was so disappointed that I didn't even take photos of the food. The only thing I ate here was the Lobster Ravioli, Smoked Salmon and a piece of Lasagna. There was nothing that stood out about the food.  I wouldn't recommending coming here to anyone. Spend a few extra bucks, and go to another buffet.

I went Sunday for brunch, and since it was Memorial Day Weekend, they jacked the price up even more and didn't even have anything special to eat.  Not being a meat eater, I'm sure there are probably some decent dishes that I didn't eat, but all of the vegetarian options were just alright.  I've enjoyed buffets at the casinos in San Diego much more than I did this one and they seem to have much more variety too.  The saving point of the MGM Grand Buffet is the dessert section.  I love all of the individual bite-size desserts.  That way I can try them all!  My favorite was the pistachio-almond gelato.  Best I've ever had, but not enough to make up for the rest of the buffet.",

I got some ham and was sawing on it with my knife like it was a steak.  Yuk.  The bacon was also undercooked and soft.  Another yuk.  The fruit selection was pretty good, and tasty.  The pineapple and cantaloupe were sweet and juicy.  There were also whole apples and bananas.    The orange juice did taste sweet and fresh-squeezed.  The coffee was WEAK!  It looked like tea, and tasted like crap.  The pancakes and waffles were obviously frozen.  They were doable, but tasted like the eggos I pull out of the freezer through the week before going to work.  The other downside was that the syrup wasn't in an area that kept it warm.  Each table had a cold bottle of Log Cabin on the table.  Cheap.  The waitress only came by once to take our drink order.  She was MIA for the rest of breakfast.  Some of the other wait staff did eventually take our used plates that were piling up at the end of the table.  If this buffet was $7.99, I would have been OK with what we got.  Since we paid almost twice as much, I was expecting more.  We won't bother to go back to this buffet.  There are so many other good options in Vegas!",

I wasn't starving or I woulda ate so much more but wat I did eat was soooo good! When Im back in Vegas, this will be a stop during the weekend, NO EXCEPTIONS! lol",

    "text": "Well, this is my first review on a string of reviews for my recent trip to Vegas. I ate at the Grand Buffet for dinner on June 28, 2007. Got there around 7:00 PM and there was no line. Got to the table within 3 minutes after paying. To me, the price for dinner was too high. I think it was $25 per person? But my dad did have a $25 dining credit, so it was 1 free, so we gave this place a shot. I loaded up on prime rib, hot and cold split Alaskan king crab legs, and peel and eat shrimp. The prime rib was good, but a little too dry. The shrimp was good and the crab was good, although on my 3rd plate, the crab meat was dry (a disadvantage when it comes to split legs). And this buffet has a memorable mashed potato cake bar where they take a mashed potato cake and add sundried tomatoes, green onions, mushrooms, cheese, broccoli, and/or bacon to it. It was so great, I had 3 of those. I regrettably avoided most of their other foods because I knew that $25 had to be put to good use and the crab legs and the shrimp and prime rib did the job. The dessert bar was small, although had a good selection. I had chocolate mousse that was great, an Oreo cheesecake that was creamy, and vanilla ice cream (Yes, that was too much sugar).   Our waiter was always there to refill our drinks and gave us extra mints in the end. We tipped him well.  Overall, the food was good, BUT I would think it's worth it to spend an extra buck or two at the Bellagio dinner buffet, although the Bellagio doesn't have that great mashed potato cake, but hey, what can you do?",

I had to go to the end of the next line. I argued and complained of course. Also, the staff has an attitude when bringing out food to a new station. YOU CAN'T TOUCH IT!! Oh yea, then why bring the food out?!!  Do yourself a favor, go get a $1 Big Bite from AM/PM. It will be comparable to this place.

    "text": "'Which buffets should I go to while visiting the Las Vegas strip?'  It's the question that haunts all of us and never seems to escape our nightmares.  Well one of the answers for me is the MGM buffet.  I have heard the Bellagio, Aladdin, and Rio are the best, but you will be paying more there.  I have been to several other buffets on the strip and the MGM has been my favorite because of the value.  Our waiter was a little slow to clear our plates and refill our drinks, but he was very friendly and it was extremely busy.  They have some of everything, which I guess would be expected at any decent buffet, but these guys seem to have it all.  Best chile relleno I've ever had in my life, really good creme brulee, and many types of cheesecakes among an incredible dessert selection.  For breakfast they do made-to-order omelettes, and at night cooked-to-order steak.  For dinner they Alaskan King Crab Legs, and the list could go on forever of course, but I sure did feel like I was at Disneyland when I noticed the stack of Cracker Jacks!  That made it really special for me.  Check their website listed here for the hours of lunch and dinner, and a highlight of the menu.  Tip 1: Using a duffel bag as seen in the movie Vegas Vacation  is not permitted at this buffet. Tip 2: Make it for lunch (until 2:30) and it's $10 cheaper ($20 for lunch, $30 for dinner)",

I only tried it because they advertised an all day buffet, breakfast, lunch and dinner, for a single price of $29.95. I had a feeling there would be some kind of a catch, and of course, there was.  I tried the buffet at dinner and after paying $29.95, asked if that included breakfast and lunch the next day. The answer was \"no\", that special is only if you start early in the day for breakfast, you can get lunch and dinner included that same day.  As for the food, it was OK. If you are into desserts, you might like this buffet.  Although I didn't try any of the desserts, they had an excellent selection of various cakes, puddings, cookies and ice cream. It sure looked good.",

I use to come here all the time when I was in Vegas for their champaign brunch on Saturday or Sunday, but over the last two years this place has gone downhill. The last couple of times I've been there the food has been bland, dry, & often cold. The deserts are hard, & don't really taste that good. Even the ice cream & jell-o is hard..... Not sure how they managed to pull that off, I guess they want to be consistent at having gross food all the way across the board.  It's looks like they have a wide selection of food here but after walking through you realize it's the same lame food on both sides. The only thing decent about this place is their servers are usually good with following up on you, but all they do is refill the soda like any other server at a buffet is suppose to do so who really gives a sh1t about that. If I'm dropping 17-26 bucks on a buffet I want good food not fresh tap water.  So in a nutshell F this place, you're better off taking your money a half mile over to the food court and pay 6 bucks for a quarter pounder \"without\" cheese ($7.50 with) at the mcdonalds and use the remaining 12 bucks getting wasted on the free drinks at the penny slots.",

I'm glad this was a business trip and was expensed. Here's the breakdown of why: -The \"steak\" was rediculously overdone, which I can see why they would drown it in sauce. -The Roast Beef at the carving station looked more like a ball of muscle that they literally just lopped off of a cow. \"Yeah hey, lets not trim that, it looks fine... I mean sure it looks like the meatball alien thing from Duke Nukem, but people love nostalgia. -The macaroni and cheese was creamy, but only tasted like macaroni. Why would you serve this? -The Crab legs... are sliced through with, what I would assume was, a table saw. Nothing screams delicious like small bits of crab leg shell in the steamed-out, dried up, blade-o-grass thin, crab legs. After I had essentially given up on the \"great eating\" here, I decided to try the lower quality \"food\". Who the hell makes sweet and sour chicken with chicken nuggets? Oh these guys do. And the nuggets? The only thing they were missing was a Double Bubble Branding. I didn't want to delve into why whys and hows, because it wasn't going to be pretty, but here it is. I hope that MGM can rise from this mess and actually produce decent food again soon.",

(typical raging yelper quote) i am not mad, because i got two buffet for free. i am just mad that i had to spend my dinner eating garbage they serve here when i could've had eaten else where, and be satisfied.  okay, back to realism.  there are quiet bit of selection of food to choose from, and they could look deceivingly good.  but the taste is where my rage-review comes from.  imagine the most horrifying cafeteria food, or your nearby worst buffet food, combine them and you have mgm grand buffet.   their rooms are nice , but this buffet needs to move out to elsewhere.   jesus, how do they maintain this buffet place?  dinner $29.99 - lol, i won't even pay $4.99 to eat that crap again.",

To keep it real, the best thing IMO was the salad...which I made on my own. Lol.   Even the dessert wasn't all that great.   One thing I didn't like was that they don't tell you if the items are spicy. The guacamole I got was actually pretty darn spicy..not that I don't love spicy, but still.  My dad got these clams, and he almost started crying because of the spiciness. Warn a brotha!",

The price is pretty low compared to other buffets, but you're probably better off spending more and seeing better quality at the higher end buffets like the Bellagio or the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar's.  The lighting and decor is a bit dismal, which contributes to a rather old feeling atmosphere.  The food is fine ... nothing wrong with it, but the selection isn't exactly wow either.  I don't have a problem with the food since the price is lower, but the overall look of the place just doesn't fly in this day and age.",

Early in the morning...really chipper...and those rosy cheeks...how could she be wrong?  Oh, she could be very wrong.  The scrambled eggs looked like grated chick peas, ac was pumping so the food on your plate was cold by bite # 3, overall was just not worth the $30 per person.   I have to say, the service was excellent.  Our server took our drink order and brought our drinks right away. And he passed by our table to check in w/us very frequently.    Other than the good service, it just wasn't worth the price.  Just go to the bellagio's buffet instead.",

This is when you should go here:  -you're too hungover to walk outside into the 95 deg heat (assuming you're staying at MGM) -you don't care about the tastiness of food offerings -your priority is to fill your belly, drink an impressive amount of water, then go back to bed  On a side note: The hash was cold, the eggs benedict was weird and awful, and the huevos rancheros was blah.

The service was friendly and good. Our server kept the mimosas coming and made sure to clear all dirty dishes from our table quickly. I really like their dessert station, miniature portions but everything we had was delicious and we tasted almost every dessert they had. The only thing we had that was not good was the Miso Soup, it was simply bland foggy water with a few pieces of seaweed, no tofu & no seasoning.   Overall, it is a lot better than the Palace Station Buffet, but not worth what the MGM  charges. I still prefer the Circus Circus Buffet, greater selection for half the price.  The Paris Buffet is better than the MGM, for about the same price.",

This being said, everything else is delicious and is replaced quickly.

Rising resort fees. Parking fees.   You can see this Nickle and dime mentality at this buffet. First, it's $40. That's not a cheap meal.   However the brain trust at MGM does everything they can to make certain they maximize profit. Paper napkins. Plastic cups. Except for clearing plates there's no table service whatsoever. Everything including drinks is self service.   The food is mediocre at best. Turkey roll not real turkey. Much of it looks like it's just reheated Costco fair. There's only one fresh station, a Japanese stir fry. That was decent. Everything else was forgettable. When the best item at the dessert station is soft serve ice cream you know the bean counters have been working on cost control.   If you want a cheaper buffet save yourself $$$ and go to harrahs. Food isn't great but it's also $10 cheaper.   For $10 more the buffet at caesars is worth the walk.   Pass MGM grand buffet by.",

There is no start and end, there are lots of little starts and ends, there is no flow, which makes for a lot of awkward cutting in front of people and going in opposite directions.  The Canadian in me died during all my line cutting and getting in people's way.

    "text": "By far, the worst buffet I've been to in Las Vegas, which is really disappointing considering the fact that the MGM Grand is a well known casino on The Strip.   I paid the about $25 for my meal, I had come in just as brunch ended. I had brought a few things to keep me company, as I was dining alone because the rest of my party was at the photography conference. I figured the buffet was a safer place than roaming around the casino.   I was seated in a corner booth away from most of my fellow buffet-ers and was greeted warmly and asked my beverage selection. She refilled my soda and water once. And that was the end of that. I vaguely remember her telling another table that her shift was over but she never let me know.   The buffet at MGM is about half the cost of the Baccanal Buffet, with about 1/3 of the selection. I did the walk around, to see what they had and found it to be lacking. There was an entire section they were not using. They had a few Mexican dishes, a few Asian dishes, a salad bar, a few kinds of sushi, what looked like leftover breakfast rolls, a few pastas, the usual chicken, and other sides... And this weird deli sandwich area thing... Which I've never seen at a buffet, not even hometown. They had a roast guy with... I think it was prime rib and some sausage, but both were \"meh.\"  I ended up needing to use the restroom during my meal and learned that there wasn't one inside the buffet. I asked if I could return after and a busser said I could. I was a little nervous they would clear my table, so I left my book and notebook there with a \"will be back, please don't clear this stuff.\" I returned easily, but came back to find the table cleared and my books gone!  I got a plate of fruit (which wasn't very ripe) and waited in hopes that the servers would come by the now deserted section so that I could flag them down. But alas, no. I lost my appetite and decided to leave, upset that the MGM Grand didn't have a Grand Vegas Style buffet.   This review would have been one star, had it not been for the bubbly dessert chef who I accidentally called \"sir.\" She was very welcoming and personable and we talked about desserts and the different things that were there. Most of the desserts were delicious, but let's be honest here, if you mess up on the dessert bar, you really shouldn't be in the buffet business",

First off, there is a sign right in front of the Buffet that says some prices in very large writing, so when you walk by the sign you think that is the 'real' prices (i think it says 17.99 during the week and 21.99 for the weekend).  But you have to look at the small print and see that it is on for 'to go' orders.  That threw us off right off the bat.  The real price is $31.00.  So they suckered us in with that sign and i wasn't happy about that.    Second, the food was blahhh.  Pretty much what you can get at a $9.99 buffet anywhere.  Some of the better things they had were all gone and when i asked how long it would take to cook them and for them to be available they told me 5 minutes.  15 minutes later they still weren't ready.  Plenty of other buffets to try in Vegas, dont waste your time on this one.",

Janice play was excellent as was my swordfish. I don't know what everybody else is complaining about.   Very pleased, we will be there.

The one thing I did enjoy was the turkey and gravy from the carving station. Other reviews say the price is good, but I thought $35 was pricey for the quality.",

We went on a weekend brunch, so it included \"free beer and wine.\" What was the beer? Bud Light and Coors Light. Pass. The wine was equally non-impressive. All the other beverages were self-service, from tea, coffee, to those now commonplace Coca-cola Freestyle machines. The meat section had one person working both sides, the carving station and grill station. The seafood section attempts to be fancier, but they dropped the snow crab legs in favor of dungess and stone crab. They grill/cook somethings to order, like crawfish, but if you get the tuna, the middle tends to be still cold/frozen. The sushi is not made of right kind of rice. There's way too much filler food like fried chicken, and pizza (if you get these, please go to a food court instead!) It wouldn't be so bad if the price wasn't so high at $43.  We had points so we're steaming mad. The service was friendly though. The guy at the meat station tried his best.",

Also, they have fresh cut fruit, sushi, and roast beef.   The reason I am also giving this location 4 stars is because of the service and the attention I received. After a little situation I encountered, I had a manager named Abbie come to my table. She resolved my issue and complaint quickly and effectively. She was so courteous and professional on top of that. After everything, she just made things better and I left the buffet happy. We are staying at the MGM hotel this week and I'm sure I'll come back tomorrow for dinner once again with my family.  PS. I would suggest going for dinner and not lunch. You'll get a much better variety of food. Lunch was boring. Dinner time had all the good and expensive stuff out like crab legs and shrimp.",

I wish they had more soups to choose from. I felt like the soup was leftovers in some creamy sauce.  The part I did like, was the mini bites of desserts. So smart to have them bite-sized so you don't waste it. The carrot cake and key lime pie were good.",

When you have people going in a million different directions with plates piled high, small children darting all around and very little space to move in - It's a disaster waiting to happen! The actual counter space is pretty expansive, but they only use half of it and cram it all together. This is what creates the CLUSTER!   The offerings on the buffet are fairly dull. Not a lot of flavor to any of the dishes. The only items worth checking out are shrimp & crab legs. The crab legs are sliced right down the middle which makes easy retrieval of the meat without little effort - perfect! The seafood is only offered at certain times of the day so make sure you've timed it right before throwing down the cash.",

    "text": "We met family from out of town here to eat (since that's where they wanted to go). I've had better, it wasn't awful... but I'm not inclined to go back.  Best things I had:  1) mini carrot cake complete with cream cheese frosting, it was nicely spice and how carrot cake is supposed to be.  2) peel and eat cold shrimp and snow crab legs. The crab was sweet, the shrimp were nicely flavored. They both tasted fresh and not fishy.  3) fresh fruit the melon, strawberries and pineapple were all juicy and flavorful.  Mediocre things: 1) steamed veggies....they were a little on the soggy side.  2) tiramisu cup, there was hardly any lady finger in it :( that's the best part!  3) cappuccino mouse, very rich....but a lot of clear brownish fluid was in a pocket in it....not sure if it just wasn't mixed good or what?  4) black beans, they're kind of hard to screw up :)  Could have been okay but.....  1) Chili Relleno. The cheese filling was good, but there was wayyyyy too much breading on it which did nothing but retain too much grease....if there would have been less breading and not as greasy this would have fallen in the category above.  2)peanut butter cream puff. Dry, kind of defeats a \"cream\" puff.  Yuck:  1) crab salad....I don't know if it was imitation crab meat, or old crab... but this was fish and gross...the crab was also rubbery.  2) California roll, ewww gross. I actually spit this out into my napkin. It was so fishy it made me gag a little before I spit it out!  3) mac n cheese pretty bland and gooey....I think maybe they made it with generic velveta?  So, that's the run down of what I ate, about all I could fit in my tummy. So, in my opinion stick to the peel and eat shrimp and crab :) Not sure about the other meats because I don't eat it.....my hubby said they were okay, not the best, not the worst. He pretty much agrees with me on the \"Meh. I've experienced better\"",

What bothers me about the buffet,  is that with all the real quality dining destinations at the other end of the hotel you would expect the buffet to be more in line with the Wynn or the Bellagio.  On one end of the casino you have Craftsteak, Sea Blue, Pearl, L'Atelier and numerour other quality dining experiences, but that quality does not extend to the Buffet. It is a nice buffet, but I think at the MGM you want more than nice I realize it is a buffet ...........  but I think there could be some improvements in the \"quality\" .  The desert bar is nothing special, if fact there does not seem to be anything about the buffet that really stands out in your memory after your visit. Perhaps that is my concern - it is not a bad experience -  but neither is it a memorable one.",

It was 5:00 and people were coming in for dinner and they did not have enough people working to sit people.  There were open tables and people were getting mad.  My husband is a sushi man and he said that is was very very dry.  He even tried it when they had bought more out and still said it was dry.  The watermelon was not sweet it was tasteless.  I don't think they had a good variety of food or deserts. However, I did like the small portions of the way they did the deserts.  They were small portions so not wasteful if you did not eat it all. They just did not have a variety to pick from.  They did not have any kind of pies or cakes.  I did however, think the way they cut the crab open was great. It looks like they slice it open.  You would think that the MGM and the Rio would be one of the best buffets in Las Vegas but this time that we were here we were disappointed in both of them.  Our favorite was the flamingo.  They have the BEST buffet in Las Vegas and we give them a 5 star for their bufett.   Would we go there again . Mosty likely NOT to pricey and not the best.  Anderson's Northern California",

This day Jan 11, at 12:30, there was also the ubiquitous carving station, which I skipped. I had instead, the cheese ravioli, giant sized in a white cheese sauce, and a side of creamed spinach. While both were of restaurant quality, the spinach was superior. Toothsome and fresh, it melded with sauce like good homemade, must have caught fresh out of the kitchen : } . I also had a piece of fried catfish, again fresh tasting. As well as a bit of good mac and cheese. Being warmer items, this all could have been just good luck. (when I walked out, I played a nickel poker game, 1 hand, deuces wild, hit a straight spade flush. Won 25 dollars om 65 cents.) I'm just saying, could have been my lucky day.   The desert selection was not a accident, I had a lime tort, cappichino fluff, cheesecake bite, a chocolate mousse,  a fruit tart. This was out of a selection base of about 20. All again, of restaurant quality! Seriously, plated with a few squiggles and dust and they would stand up. I'm gonna hit breakfast on this trip too, and will update. Definably better than the Belligio, which I hit 3 months ago.",

If you are looking for waffles, they are in the dessert area. That took us three tries to find. Our table was never bussed, so we had a pile of plates on our table. Wasn't the best brunch I've ever had and not sure if I would pay that much again for it.",

My issue is in comparison, the higher price sets an expectation that doesn't deliver. Most people want to feel like they are getting what they pay for and here just doesn't feel that way. The food does not sit for too long and there is a sizable selection.   The MGM group has had deals that included free or cheap buffets and that makes sense....if you're paying for a buffet I would suggest going over to Excalibur.",

I'm not sure on what Cosmopolitan charges but it's considerably worth double the price. The MGM made me think of Sizzler from what I remember about that restaurant. It's more quantity than quality which is the opposite of the Wicked Spoon which was more about quality bites. If you could eat a horse MGM will do, otherwise I'd look else where.",

Got drinks quick  Selection: Lots more then something like Ryan's or Golden Corral that's for sure. it had asian, american, italian, desserts, etc.   Taste: Most of the items I got tasted good. I did not like the penne pasta though the saue was way too high pitched. I like my pastas to have a low pitch and my pizzas to have a high pitch. This place got both in reverse. The Swai fish was my fav item there. Tasted really good. I had a lot of it. I also liked the \"tit ravioli\" it really looked like tits. LOL. but it was good. I also liked the turkey and I normally hate turkey.   Service: My sister has Celiac disease. She can not have gluten and the chef there was really professional and he was able to show her exactly what she can eat and since he made it he knows how it was made. Very nice. Buffets are next to impossible for her and this was awesome for her to be able to partake in a buffet.   Overall: Highly recommended and very good. pricey though.   Overall rating: 8.9/10",

    "text": "We ate there a couple of times over the Thanksgiving holidays; once Thanksgiving evening and once for brunch.  Long lines and waits Thanksgiving evening and $40 a head to get a meal.  The food was okay but nothing I would ever pay that amount for again.  Food lines are hectic and people are so rude and can't wait their turn to access the food (not the buffet's fault) but it makes getting your meal like a foot race to fill your plate before someone else grabs that last chicken leg in the pan.  Staff there really do nothing for you, as a diner, except remove your plate but it seems like tipping is expected...for what?    Brunch was okay and lots of choices but once again, don't expect a great breakfast or lunch and then you won't be disappointed.  Vegas isn't a great value when it comes to food and because new customers come in every day and don't likely return to the same restaurant, there's no real real reason to change things up for the better.  We have casinos outside of Denver that offer great buffets including endless prime rib and crab legs for $25.  How do they offer better fare for less money?  Because Coloradans will stop patronizing them if the food isn't that great and they rely on repeat customers.  And the casinos there are smoke free...gotta love it!  We still love coming to Vegas and visit regularly....we just continue to learn where to eat a great meal for a reasonable price and this buffet won't be on our repeat list....sorry MGM.  The Smiths",

I just can't give it three stars. They got the extra half for the service. Go somewhere else for breakfast - $23 apiece?! ;( Vegas has gotten pricier, but they should step up their food options, though I suppose compared to their super expensive restaurants in the MGM, $23 is quite affordable.",

You can imaging the standard American breakfast eggs, bacon, hash browns, sausage, etc.  Ok that's great but this took place on both side of the isle.  Are you kidding me?!?!?!??  $40 for the same crap on both sides??!?!?!?  Oh, there was turkey whoopee!!    Some guy came by in a suit and ask if everything was ok and I said hell no!!  I told him the truth.  \"It's like a Denny's but bigger!!!\"  and I explained further that for $40 bucks you expect something more than Denny's on both side of the isle!!!  10 mins later I saw the chef came out scratching his head clueless as usual.  The best part of the meal was the tiny Belgian waffles for apparently $40 bucks.",

I don't visit Las Vegas very often and was expecting the Buffett to be very expensive but at only $26 per person on Saturday morning I feel that we got an incredible value.  The bottomless mimosas were worth that alone.  The bar staff had no problem when I asked for straight champagne since after 1 or 2 Mimosas they tend to be very sweet. The variety as expected at a Las Vegas buffett was plentiful.  I stayed strictly to breakfast  items but the lunch options did look good.  I went back for seconds on the corned beef hash it was the best part of the meal for me. The made to order omelet was great as well. I loaded my 1st plate to combine my 3 favorite breakfast meals with eggs Benedict, chicken fried steak with gravy and bagels with lox.  These were all good not great but the glutinous nature of the buffet experience makes up for that a little. There is always room for dessert! I tried a few single bites of multiple items but could not resist finishing the miniature pecan pie, decadent! Go early if you can, we waited 5 minutes around 9am by the time we left the line looked like an hour wait.",

Very disappointed and disillusioned with this buffet. I do not recommend it. My father was able to slightly rectify the situation by making an egg salad sandwich from scratch. At least that wasn't dry! It's pretty sad when you have to prepare your own food in order to have something you like at a buffet! There's a carving station but they only had turkey and some saugages (you guessed it - dry too).  I was told they were out of Tri-tip. I made myself a sandwich, something I never do at buffets. On the up-side, the desserts were good and I had lots of room!",

Pretty nice size, not the biggest but what they do have is okay. I hit the crab legs first, got a plate full of cold crab legs which were tasty. My gf said, \" oh on the other side in the corner there might be hot ones\". So my second plate of crabs were hot. But it was the bottom of the tray and was steamed too long. A lot of it was dry and tasteless. Yeah I preferred the cold legs.  The prime rib was blah, not seasoned enough. They had some kind of a braised beef dish, the sauce was good but the meat was a little dry.   The best part of this buffet had to be the desserts! It's a small counter area but everything looked good. First things I saw were the cobbler and bread pudding, mmmm couple of my favorites. But I ended up getting neither!!  I picked the keylime pie, blueberry parfait, strawberry tiramisu and this fruit with creme custard thingy. AWESOME DESSERTS!!!  The service was also very good. Our waitress was on it, cleaning dirty plates and spot on with refills!!  So if you just stick with the crab legs and desserts you won't be disappointed!!",

Luckily, we got reward points for this buffet, so we didn't have to fork out much for it. We tasted the Alaskan crab legs, it was very salty (eeek!!) Umm, I would not come back.",

    "text": "The buffet at the MGM wasn't too terrible. We had a voucher for two complimentary breakfasts that we had redeemed off the MyVegas game on Facebook. Upon arrival, there was about a 20-25 minute wait with about 10 or more people in front of us. They only had two cashiers so the line felt like it was dragging. I've mentioned mentioned before on a separate review for the MGM Grand hotel itself that they are pretty understaffed so the same goes for their buffet area. Most of the time I spent at the MGM I was waiting on staff to assist us. Once we got to the front of the line we realized we could have been in the VIP line (bummer), but were quickly seated. The drinks are a serve yourself thing from the machines. You have the option to add different flavors to personalize your drink so it's pretty cool. The food itself wasn't too shabby, there just wasn't that many options to choose from. Also, some of the serving tongs were very hot especially for the churros. It would be a better idea to not have the serving spoons resting inside the serving pans and possibly outside. Even when the tong is resting the the pan it tens to burn your hands. As we were finishing our meal they were bringing out the lunch which looked a bit more appetizing, but I don't believe the meat selection changed all that much. Our server was kind and he had taken our dishes twice during our meal and checked on us often. If you're getting complimentary meals and don't mind the wait this buffet isn't too bad. Other than that, I don't believe I would return unless it was free again and I had time, lol.",

Anyway, I was trying to get my money's worth when I made the mistake of grabbing too many shrimp. They had just the strangest taste, but the Irish in me pressed on, determined to clear my plate. Eventually I had to give up, and shamefully waste a half dozen. Working on the second plate, I noticed this place is missing a few things. They have fish & chips, but no tartar sauce. Who does that? Eventually I made my way to the dessert table, and realized I should've spent my whole night there. Their cakes and tiramisu are great, but not worth an extra star, given the rest of the experience.

    "text": "Thank you MyVegas for another comp meal!  I vowed never to come back to the MGM Grand Buffet after getting sick a few years ago. But this time I found myself with a comp dinner buffet and no one to have dinner with. I easily got my voucher at the mLife desk and walked over to the buffet. I flashed my Pearl card and was able to by pass the lines. Then came the sad part (1)...I stood in the VIP line next to the group of 6+ or whatever, so everyone could see me alone. The hostess asked me how many people, and I raised one finger. She looked at me confused and then whispered into her microphone. A nice gentlemen came by and took me to my table for four, as the music over the stereo sang, \"all by myself....don't want to be...all by myself...anymore\" haha. Great comedic timing. Anyway I felt bad taking up a table for four when there were all these other people in line but I trekked on to the buffet line anyway.  There's a ton of salad options and hot foods from BBQ themed to Asian cuisine. None of it was outstanding, a bit bland or over cooked from sitting out too long. There were crab legs in the ice bar section but the steamed ones next to the carving station was better. The rib roast was pretty good. And sadly my favorite was the nachos...I don't know why, nachos just make me happy.  Sad part (2), as I'm walking back from the second lap at the buffet table, I was confused that a family of four was sitting at my spot. I walked around thinking, maybe I got the location wrong, but I wasn't. I finally found my server and he said he thought I was done because I had A plate. I begin questioning myself if I've had too much food already haha, but he finally found me another table after I stood in the center of the dinning room being starred at by multiple families.  To wrap up this story, the desserts weren't very good BUT the three gelato they had were AMAZING. I asked the lady for small scoops of each but she decided to make me a sundae. Oh well...it was all good. No stomach sickness after this trip, but if I were to pay full price for this meal, I would've been pretty disappointed. Spend a few bucks more and go to the Bellagio.",

I think if you can afford it you are better off paying a little more and going to some of the more highly rated buffets. The variety isn't bad but the quality is what brings the rating down for me. It's definitely better than going than the Golden Corral but with so many great food choices in Vegas it's hard to recommend.",

    "text": "We recently spent the weekend in Vegas. We had trouble with our rooms at the signature so we got $100 credit to try at any location belonging to the MGM. We decided on the MGM Grand Buffet. We were kind of iffy about it because of the reviews but we didn't want the credit to go to waste.   We went on a Saturday afternoon for brunch. We were informed about the unlimited mimosas which were very tasty. We were seated right away.  We thought the buffet was very clean compared to other buffets we've visited including the ones in our hometown. The person we got to pick up our plates was very friendly! He made sure everything was okay every time he stopped or passed by our table.  The food was really good as well. They had all the breakfast food and some pasta, seafood! You name it ! The staff we interacted with were friendly. The only thing was that we were told one mimosa at a time per guest but saw they allowed other people take up to three at a time. We constantly had to get up for one. Still good though  Good food and unlimited mimosas",

Once seated, I went to explore the food fare!  The breakfast buffet had an omelette bar, carving table with Portuguese sausage and ham. There was a bagels and lox bar, waffles, pancakes, cold cuts, grits, crepes with assorted fruit, cereal oatmeal, soft serve ice cream, and many assorted mini desserts, muffins, and I ordered the all I can drink menu, so beer to go with all my food seemed good to me!  Now, I didn't get to try all of the food items but I did like the food I did eat.  I'll be honest, this buffet didn't really have a lot of offerings than other places I've been too, but I feel like this place is a \"less is more\" menu selection so one doesn't feel to overwhelmed walking about trying to decide what to eat.  I like the simple choices and the waitstaff were friendly and fast.  If you find yourself at the MGM Grand hotel and you're feeling hungry, check out the buffet!",

We were seated promptly and the persons that were hosting at the top of the ramp as well as the person who seated us were very friendly.  In addition, we had an incredibly friendly server as well, who was very attentive.  I consistently find the buffet at MGM Grand to have such a great selection, while having incredible flavors and tastes.    The only issue I had on this evening, was the person by the grill had dollar bills laying everywhere to the one side of the grill.  That didn't seem very sanitary.",

We came around 1015 (they were closing down breakfast at 1030, but they were adding lunch items to the menu which was a good look since now we had more a variety during their rotation (Im not much of a breakfast food person anyway). I did have a bagel w/Fresh Lox (which was yummy, and their cheese grits were not bad either). For Lunch menu items, I had their sushi, and their mac n Cheese was to die for (Have you ever EATEN or SEEN mac n cheese at a buffet?? It normally looks hideous). Their prime rib was moist, but steer clear from their taco bar  because although the guac was DELICIOUS their meat looked like \"mystery meat\" . fresh Veggies, sushi, etc...   The only downfall was that It took a while for a waitstaff to clear our plates from the table. If you are in a large party, be prepared to wait a lot longer (and pay a little more) than parties of 4 or less.",

I've been to the buffet at Mandalay Bay, which happens to be my favorite hotel in Vegas! And I was so disappointed.... so not worth the money or time lol  I always make the same mistake at buffets...I always forget to leave room for dessert! I really suggest people start with the dessert station!   This buffet just had literally everything and anything you can think of! The scampi station was my favorite! The spicy shrimp scampi was so delicious! They cook it for you right then and there and they don't use the little shrimps either! And you can get crab legs there too!  Soft drink station had a pretty good selection! But let's not fill up in liquid!   I didn't even see the salad bar cuz I was just having everything else and couldn't make my way there lol   I highly recommend MGM's buffet!",

In our case, we never had to wait in line I guess because we didn't eat during peak hours.  Customer service was OK.  The first time I ate there, the service was great and we got a lot of attention. The second time, not so much-we had to ask for our drinks twice and the service was slow.  I guess it really depends on who your server is and how busy they are.    They have a pretty wide variety of food including Asian, American, Mexican, seafood, pastas, soul food, etc.  Most of their food was alright, some really tasty and some A-OK.  You could tell that some of the food items were sitting there for awhile as the texture wasn't all that great and it didn't taste as fresh.  Overall, this buffet is mediocre.  It's such a shame the quality of food isn't better for being at such an awesome hotel.  I also prefer the dinner buffet over the breakfast buffet.",

YES!  I get really hesitated to eat seafood outside of home because I tend to get sick easily but the MGM never made me feel sick eating it. I could tell they handle their food very well, everything seemed to be at the right temperature and clean. Not a huge selection of seafood but they do have smoked salmon, mussels, CRAB LEGS! (Cold AND steamed), and CLEAN shrimps! No dodo in the shrimps like most restaurants. Not a huge fan of their sushi because of the rice.   They also have meats, pasta, salad, fruits and just a random selection of a little bit of everything.  If you play MyVEGAS SLOTS, you could actually eat for FREE if you claim their rewards. How could anyone pass up on FREE FOOD?!   MGM buffet is affordable and tasty! I can't forget to mention that the service is EXCELLENT! They refill your waters without you even asking, clean table every time you get up to get a new plate. I love it here.",

I recommend getting there early. The food is fresh and there's no line.  I opted for the Sunday dinner buffet. You get all you can drink Coors, Bud or house red or white wine. Mimosas, tequila and other mixed drinks cost extra, but there's a $9 option (ask about it). Great desserts including soft serve, bread pudding, cobbler and various chocolate desserts.

The selection of food here is not worth $130 for a family of four. If the food wasn't decent, it was bland, basic, or outright unappetizing. They even managed to mess up the Mac and cheese for my 10 year old. His first bite was cold, soggy, and had little to no cheese at all. My oldest was even tempted to scold the chefs for ruining so many basic dishes. Do yourself a favor and save your time and money. I promise that you will be let down if you come here.",

I think I will skip it the next time.",

    "text": "The MGM buffet certainly was not \"grand\". It was average at best, similar to most other buffets on the strip. First off, it was quite expensive. For four of us it cost $150 for brunch. The food was average, nothing I tried blew me away. I was also unhappy to find that you now need to get your own drinks at a drink station. This seems unfair to the wait staff. They already have difficulty getting tips at a buffet since you get your own food. They had a cocktail drink station that you had to pay nine dollars for a wristband for margaritas. The only positive I found was the dessert station. I did find the cakes to be very tasty and professionally made. If you're going to spend this amount of money to eat, it is worth trying a mid-priced range restaurant instead.",

Tried 2 different servings of prime rib 1st was very dry, 2nd serving was bloody to great extent,  neither satisfied my taste for some beef.  The horseradish sauce was potent, almost made up for the prime rib's deficiencies.  Breaded shrimp was dry,  the cocktail sauce was good (spicy).  The Lime desert's lime taste was weak uninteresting.  The Apple cobbler was good.   Coffee was good, hot with no bitter taste.    Buffet was $32.99 but the taste and enjoyment value was not even close to the price.     Wait staff was excellent, polite and friendly, dinning facilities were good.   The Convenience of walking downstairs to the buffet from the room was its only redeeming value.    A return visit is unlikely anytime in the future.",

They have a good selection of food like shrimp, California rolls, prime rib, crab legs, pizza, soup, fruit, salad, and a bunch of other stuff. A few reasons why I only gave this place 3 stars: the shell is still on the shrimp, crab legs are small, and the food quality was just okay. One interesting item they had was the curry empanada, but it was just a bunch of the outer shell and a tiny bit of curry. If you had the option to do so, I'd pick either Wicked Spoon, Bellagio, or Bacchanal buffet since they have some interesting selections of food and their quality (and price) is higher.  Overall I'd recommend this place if you are nearby and too lazy to walk to the other buffets. It isn't the worse, but it isn't the best either. At least this place has people in it (I've never really seen the buffet in the Monte Carlo packed with people unless it is a big holiday).",

Total with tax came to $86.49 for the three of us.  This would be the first time that Ian understood the concept of a buffet at Vegas. So, we spent a lot of time showing him the different kind of foods, and the tour did pique his curiosity.   Pros: Service was on point. Plates were being removed as soon as we set them aside. Napkins etc. were being stocked as well. We did stay here a little over 2 Hours. (+1) Fountain drink station and options were good. Mimosa's kept flowing :) Tri-Tip had flavor. Shrimp scramble was different. Stuffed Bellpepper was delicious. Meatloaf was also very tasty. (+1)  Cons: Not much variety in desserts. (-1) Not much variety in seafood like Crab Legs, Sushi, etc.  I remember the buffet from 2010 being so-so. However, this most recent time, we had a good time. I tasted a lot more items than the previous times, and I think the Chef's have done a very good job infusing flavor into most of the menu items. I recommend trying out this place for their service and variety of food.",

He takes them right out of the boiling pot and onto a plate.  The beef was dry but I took the last couple of end pieces since I was too lazy to wait for the new stuff to come out.  Their Italian section really sets them apart.  They have cheese stuffed pasta, fresh (not flat) pizza, chicken parm, and a few other things.  The American section has the usual friend chicken, mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, etc., but they just had a fresher look to them than what you typically see at a buffet.  The Asian section felt about the same, and the desserts had a good selection without being obnoxious, cheap sugar.  TIP:  I received a $150 food credit with my reservation at Monte Carlo.  Since Monte Carlo is owned by the MGM Grand, I was able to use the credit to pay for the meal.  TIP II:  You can walk up the exit at any buffet in Vegas and ask them if you can have a look around before buying.  The quality varies widely between casinos and some are worth a few dollars more.  If you happen to find yourself next to the main buffet at a casino, pop in to see if you might want to try it later.",

We had breakfast at MGM Grand's Buffet twice during our weeklong vacation because it was delicious.  The setting was comfortable, not overcrowded, and the decor was up-to-date and clean. The friendly, professional servers attended to the tables continually checking to see if you needed anything and removing empty plates.  A wide variety of breakfast foods, cold salads, sushi, and pastries was available. Stations with chefs were present to create fresh waffles and omelets to your taste. There were many different styles of eggs, including delicious eggs benedict, bagels and lox, several varieties of sausages, Mexican dishes, oatmeal, cream of wheat, french toast, breakfast meats,  and more. Juices, coffee, teas, soda, milk, and carbonated-flavored waters were available, too.  The price ranges from $11.00 to $30.00. I don't know where the $11.00 comes in, but we paid $30.00 for breakfast. It was worth it as you can tell from the pictures. The only other buffet that I recommend is Studio B Buffet at the M Resort in Henderson, but I didn't have their breakfast buffet, just their lunch buffet. Thirty-dollars is reasonable considering the cost of other buffets along the Strip.  I would recommend MGM Grand Buffet for breakfast, hence, my 4-star rating.",

If this was $15 or even $20 I would have been happy.   But I paid $37.  At that price I expect some premium items.  And I expect good quality all around. Premium does not simply mean \"serve crab legs\" but unfortunately that seems to be the practice now.  Very little attention to any other details. There really was nothing special about any of the food. The desserts were below average and unappetizing after a few bites. Many many items were dried out (I went at 5 pm on a weds). Aside from the crab legs and crawfish as exotic items, this buffet was no different than a $15 buffet at other places.    Even compared to other strip buffets that have a more premium price, this was more expensive and not Nearly as good.  Never been so disappointed at a Buffet. Go elsewhere.",

The bacon in the bacon Brussels sprouts tasted like it had been in old oil despite this was a fresh batch. They ran out of Tiramisu before 7:00 pm. Considering the price there was no oyster.

I was charged $1.32, for what, I don't know, and $31.67 for Brunch, plus tax. Still, $35.71 for two people is not bad, but that's not the point. I wanted to redeem my reward for breakfast, which is less, and was told I couldn't. It was, simply, not an option at the time. I reminded the cashier that it was before 9am and the reward clearly states breakfast OR brunch. I did ask for a manager, and one never showed after we sat.  The food is hit and miss. The eggs were runny, assuming because they were powdered eggs and too much water was added. Best bet is a freshly made omelet. The seafood is abundant, but I stayed away from it; too early for me and did not look too appetizing. The fried Twinkies was different, not too bad. The biscuits and gravy, always good. The corn beef hash looked good, but ended up being a bit dry; go ahead and add some hot sauce or even gravy ;)  Some bread based items were extra dry or hard; croissant, french toast, the mini Belgian waffles.  The people are typical of a cruise ship buffet; many coughing, especially children who don't cover their mouths. People that pile on food as if it's going away. Pace yourself, there's plenty.   Overall, not the worst, but not the best. If you're staying within MGM, Cravings is a bit better. If you want higher end, Wynn, which is where we'll stay next time, again.",

    "text": "I rate this buffet a B-  The price isn't  bad when you use a 2-for-1 discount coupon...so that saves you some money.  We went for Dinner.  There was virtually no waiting to be seated. The buffet includes unlimited draft beer (bud and Coors Light) and red and White House wine.  You get these one at a time from the bar...leaving a tip each time for the bartenders.  You get access to everything here - the highlights are the steamed crab legs and prime rib - both which are excellent.  I can fill up on those alone. The crab legs are steamed to perfection and pre-scored to open easier. There is plenty of other seafood like clams and mussels too.  There are also chilled already peeled shrimp which is a plus!  You can get some fried mussels (which were great!) and fried shrimp too. There are plenty of other seafood items but the ones I mentioned were the best.  Tons of salads (all are just okay, nothing stood out) and the Italian dishes are confusing - raviolis and manicotti - nothing seemed very fresh there.  The Mexican section leaves a lot to be desired as well - it seemed dried up and older food, again, not as fresh as the meats and seafood.  There is a carving station too with sausages, brisket, ham and beef. They also will cook a steak of your choice to order...so that's cool.  The drink station has just about everything you can imagine from the Coca-Cola Freestyle machines to flavored waters and juices and coffee.  The dessert section was a disappointment, most everything was dry and cake-like, but if you like that sort of thing, then it may be good to you.  I prefer moist desserts. I did enjoy the banana ice cream and I added caramel sauce to it and it was delightful.",

    "text": "I tried the MGM Grand Buffet for the first time this past week for dinner before seeing the Cirque du Soleil Ka show with my parents. We arrived around 6pm and we didn't have to wait at all to pay or be seated. In my opinion this buffet has a wide variety of dishes that I haven't seen at other buffets. I think for the price it's a good value, however, I wouldn't say that it's one of the best buffets in Vegas. If you want the Vegas buffet experience but are looking for something that is more affordable I think it is worth the try. Drinks are self serve and beer and wine are also included in the price you pay. They have a carving station with prime rib and other meats, as well as hot crab legs. They also have a salad bar, fresh fruits, shrimp cocktail, pizza, pastas, a variety of Mexican and Asian foods, lots of vegetable sides and some of the best garlic bread I've tasted at a buffet. The desserts were just okay. The best one that I tried was the soft serve ice cream from the machine. I like that all of the food items are clearly labeled and that items like nuts are written out twice for people who may have allergies. Like other M Life properties this buffet also honors military discounts! If you are military make sure you join the M Life program for discounts and an automatic upgrade to Pearl status.",

The quality has slipped a bit and the lines have declined.   With the consolidation of most hotels to pretty much four main companies in the strip, buffets no longer have a uniqueness to them.   I remember being amazed as a child but as an adult and after visited other buffets in Vegas, I was sad to see that this place has lost a bit of its luster.   I will add though that the service has always been great!   If you're in the MGM and have a huge appetite, then you've come to the right place.   If you play slots or tables, you'll want to join their players card and earn a free meal as well as discounts to their rooms. What's good is you can earn comps at any of the MGM properties and redeem at their other spots.  Depending on your status you may not have to wait long in line.",

Maybe MGM doesn't care about is older properties? My advice is to seek another place because for the money you can do better.",

Plane fake scrambled eggs fake scrambled eggs with shredded cheese and  fake scrambled eggs with onions and bell peppers...COME ON!  They had an omelette station though, but I'm not sure if they use real eggs. I didn't even bother to look.  Besides the fake eggs, the food selection was pretty basic and plain. I mean, compare to the other buffets I've tried in Vegas like Bacchanal, Wicked Spoon and The Buffet at Wynn,  it was a big disapoinment. Nothing I'd come back for, that's for sure.  The only food I liked were the chicken sausage, smoked salmon, mac and cheese,  prime rib and bread pudding. Stay away form the sushi rolls. Hard rice and smelly fish, oh goodness!   Good thing it was complimentary by MGM because I would never pay $26.99 (Weekend brunch) for this kind of food. Yeah, they gave us free food for the inconvinience we experienced in our room. I still have to do a review about it.",

My family and I were enjoying our dinner and then comes a white couple that got seated behind us. The server/busser was doing his job and continuously cleaning up empty plates off table in a very polite manner. Suddenly, I heard the couple behind me get aggressive as they yell to the server/busser  \"Get the fuck away from me! just stay away from my table and stop getting near me you fucking spick!\"  It was at that moment my family and I were speechless because we were having a hard time comprehending the fact that we just witnessed racial harassment on thanksgiving as we were enjoying our dinner. After that the server/busser walked away and told the manager but no one came out to diffuse the situation. Then we thanked him out loud to let him know he is appreciated and it was at that moment the intolerant couple behind us started throwing their plates of food everywhere to let us know how upset that was making them. So we then told them how unnecessary their behavior was and it was at that point that the boyfriend began to verbally attack my family and I, then they stormed out. Keep in mind this was thanksgiving night. I can't believe our dinner was ruined, I will never be coming back again because I can't believe mgm managers would support this racist behavior by not attending to the racial/verbal harassment of an employee. I have never been so disgusted. MGM you've lost a longtime customer.",

There were quite a few items that I enjoyed enough to want a little more of.   The service was good, they took empty plates pretty quickly and the person cooking to order was friendly.   So far I have yet to find a buffet that has a good desert bar. This one was no different. It was pretty standard, nothing noteworthy.",

We arrived and things didn't look to bad, and the people were nice. it was time for food so we all grabbed our plates and headed for the food. There were very limited options and barley and food choices. All the food looked very dry and unappetizing. I tried some soup, pasta, meat, and salad. Everything tasted old and not fresh at all. It was all cold and not tasty. After a bad dinner we figured we would tie it uo with dessert. The dessert didn't look too bad and in fact, it looked quite good. The only thing that didn't look to appetizing was the soft serve but I could deal with that. We tried the best looking desserts and they were all dry. They tasted like they were just defrosted. Most of the desserts that were supposed to be hot were cold. Overall it wasn't a good experience. If you are in Vegas for a trip and want good food, i wound not recommend eating here. It was not worth what I paid.",

The omelette station was quick and delicious.  Last year, we stayed and ate the breakfast at the wynn and felt there was no difference. The MGM buffet had everything from a full salad station with all fresh ingredients, fruit bar, full selection of desserts, full selection of eggs and egg dishes, several varieties of potatoes, taquitos,  nachos, meats, fried Twinkies, etc.  The price is right. Great food!",

Of particular note we received excellent support from the manager, Shannon Young.  While purchasing our entrance tickets,  Shannon was quick to resolve a minor payment issue.  Later in the evening,  we noticed Shannon out on the floor, going table by table, talking with all the guests.  When he stopped by our table,  we politely thanked him for the added attention throughout the evening...would like to see more of that here in Las Vegas!",

There was a family who jumped in line but they took notice and made sure we were seated first. We got our drinks very quickly and the waitress gave us refills before we even asked. There was a nice variety for breakfast. They had meat, salads, fruit, an omelet station, and your typical breakfast food. They also had a good amount of desserts for it being a breakfast buffet. They had cupcakes, cake, and their soft serve machine was on.  Someone in the party has a nut allergy and this was one of the better buffets for that. Note: it is not deadly, but it is present. They only had two items with nuts that I saw. One was with the toast and croissants and another was in a separate dessert section with cake and pudding-type desserts. This was amazing to see, since many buffets have tree nut items spread throughout the buffet. This is also an easy buffet for those in wheelchairs. They had tables, not just booths, and the aisles and walkways were wide enough for a wheelchair.",

I read a lot about how buffets in Vegas are totally different from what they used to be, long gone are the days of mediocre food but apparently MGM Grand Buffet didn't get that memo. Not good at all. Service was fine and staff were friendly enough (although it's self serve). The decor was very much an highly overpriced version of Old Country buffet . The food was just bad. We ate breakfast here and the options were very limited and of very poor quality. Most of the food looked as if it had been sitting there for a long time all of it very dry, nothing was fresh. It all tasted cheap and terrible. It reminded me of those crappy complimentary breakfast spreads that low cost motels put out.  I was wondering why so many people were showing up to eat there and after reading the reviews I realize why- they were probably all eating for free. Unfortunately, we not only paid for this subpar experience but paid dearly for it- around $50 with tip and that was the early bird special! Avoid this place at all costs, even if you can eat there free. What an unfortunate blemish on an otherwise fantastic experience at the MGM.",

Theres a pretty good variety of food. In the morning there is an omelette bar that my bf likes to go to. Theres lots of stuff like pancakes, waffles, sushi, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, mexican food, fruit, salads, pastries, meats, oatmeal, cereal, yogurt, mac and cheese and lots more. So we like to start with breakfast as our first round and have lunch our second round haha we like to eat! We've gone later in the day, I'm not sure if it was lunch but i think it was and it was changing over to dinner, there wasn't much of a variety in our opinion so we definitely prefer the morning. One of the reasons we like to come here is because the first time we came we talked to one of the ladies that works there, Minnie. She's super funny and friendly so one of the many reasons we go back is to see her. Plus the food is pretty good and we always get great service.  Definitely recommend and will continue to return! :)",

Every time he came by us, he kept looking at us weird. We didn't do anything blasphemous to cause a commotion or anything. It was disheartening, but not enough to stop us from enjoying our food.  At least that creme brulee was amazing.",

    "text": "My last memories of the MGM Buffet was maybe 2 or 3 years ago before they started doing this \"all-day buffet\" thing. I love the concept of paying a flat rate of $33.60 (more on the weekends) and getting 3 turns at the buffet from Breakfast, Lunch to Dinner. They hand you this card where they will punch a hole in everytime you eat. Kind of like your high school lunch card.   I came here for breakfast, and there was nothing breakfast wise that really impressed me. I would say the best item during breakfast was having roast beef with au jus which is really a lunch or dinner item.   Lunch time, they expanded the trays a bit. I remember them used to have some type of fish or salmon.  They had shrimp in the open bar, but nothing spectacular. The high light item was the desert plate of tiramasu. Still this is not as good as the buffet at the Paris.   Lastly at dinner, the gf found the california rolls to be a high light and I m not much of a sushi fan. So I got stuck with roast beef au jux again for dinner.   Overall I wasn't impressed and I notice that the quality has degraded since the old days of MGM. If you want great buffet food go elsewhere. If you want a good bang for your buck, then come here. If you are getting a special with MGM where you get 2 for 1 buffet, then definitely take advantage of it. Otherwise, there are plenty of better buffet options out there.",

I bet a lot of the clientele is there for the same reason.  It's not as huge as you might expect, given the size of MGM. But the typical options are all there is some shape or form. As with most middle-of-the-road buffets, quality varies by type of food and time of day. Seafood option were slim when I visited last.  It's clean and usually well staffed (unlike some of the lower-end buffets, where tables are left uncleared with scraps of food on the floor). So it's worth a visit if you're nearby and the lines aren't long, especially if you have a coupon.",

This is more of a convenience buffet if you're staying at the hotel and don't want to venture out for mass quantities of food.  Everything seems kind of dreary compared to the top  buffets.  When it comes to food, taste is everything of course, however a good portion of that is going to depend on how well the food is presented to you.  The presentation of the food here is pretty sad.  Salads looked like they've been stagnant and out for a while, the prime rib and turkey looked dry at the carving stations, the desserts looked like something you'd get from Denny's. etc.  the only unique thing that the buffet offers was a mashed potato bar.  Pretty good and something I've never seen before.  They basically take an ice-cream scoopful of mashed potatoes and fry them up w/ all your fixings that you'd  normally have in a baked potato (bacon, chives, cheese, mushrooms, etc.).  Was definitely a different and yummy thing to munch on.  The coffee here is also pretty decent.  Then again, could've just been because I was sleep deprived.",

I think they had the same stuff for two days in a row, which made me a little annoyed. I was hoping that they'd at least rotate dishes throughout the week or something...

We were able to upgrade our brunch to include mimosas for an extra $2.50. That's not too shabby.  The selection was great, but the quality in some of the dishes was a bit lacking. For example, the mashed potatoes and the scrambled eggs from the breakfast area tasted institutional and the pizza was straight from the local school cafeteria. It was pretty hit-or-miss with the selections having good taste, but it was adequate.   The service was very good though and thus I gave 3 stars instead of 2.",

Abbie Starkey, the Assistant Manager of the Buffet was more than happy to help us out. She processed our refunds quick and then gave us suggestions to other places in the hotel that were open later. We returned tonight and she welcomed us back, checked up on us and then when my son got his hand on a hot surface (a second degree burn) she was quick to call in security, who showed up quick with the med bag. After calming things down she offered up the magic treat, \"Ice Cream.\" All was well! We walked out and she then chased after us with a forgotten jacket! ON THE BALL! Thanks so much Abbie for all you did TWO nights in a ROW! She was continually cheery and always seemed to be talking to guests or helping out! We will definitely return and it's 90% because of Abbie! 10% for the great food! (Which by the way I was impressed with) Fresh guacamole, AMAZING prime rib, loaded mash potatoes!! Yummo!",

It was the worst meal ever. Everything was way too salty and some of us ended up going to the restroom RIGHT AFTER. Doesn't that tell you something?  What I really appreciated was they didn't have any french fries and my brother LOVES french fries so our server went to tell the chef to make us some french fries. She brought this big bowl of french fries and I really appreciate this kind gesture. The amount of fries was enormous and the fries were pretty salty but the gesture was hands down out of this world. I could not believe the kindess we got from the server.   The stars were judged solely on their food, customer service is 10 stars!",

    "text": "So we were initially concerned with the 2 1/2 Star rating, but decided to give it a try. OKAY so not the biggest of buffets and not the biggest selection of foods but what they had was pretty good. Six of us with two kids. Kids instantly went to the sushi rolls, as did a couple of the adults! They were pretty good for a buffet, nice selection of Italian foods and pizzas looked great, grandson said they were thumbs up as he got one slice of each and ate them all. Selection of sausage and prime rib was good, prime rib pretty on the rare side. They had several choices of chicken. Some fish. Crabs legs galore and shrimp. Personally I never made it passed the grilled veggies, beautiful assortment of expertly grilled - braised veggies. Carrots were amazing. Squashes cooked perfectly, several potatoes selections . Green beans the right amount of crunch to softness. So with a big party we lived it. Oh the selection on the desert bar was pretty good, with a nice selection of 2-3 bite pieces. I have to tell you with the veggies, even though I made it to the desert bar and selected 4 pieces I could not finish one film bite. The tiramisu bites awesome! These citrus cup mousse , let's just say OHMY don't pass them up. Lemon drops are amazing! Key lime tarts were super fab with a lining of white chocolate between the pastry and key lime quite the surprise. Never made it back to the bread pudding and it looked amazing,  The coffee don't pass it up, I am a white chocolate mocha gal and I drank this coffee black it was so good!  All in all it was good food, well done and the place was clean. We were here on a Wednesday night, so not Friday or Saturday but we were impressed and the table cleaner ( can't call them server - because they done bring anything except keep the table clean and she absolutely did that). They also have a great beer and wine bar I think for $12 we choose not to do that but noticed several who did and they seemed quite happy!!!!",

    "text": "Our hotel booking site gave us two free buffets per room. MGM was the closest walking distance from our room, so we decided to give it a try.  The interior and environment was very fancy and well designed and lit, but like many others, the dress was casual. The waiter was very nice and attentive to the tables, constantly checking up on them and us. It was 2PM when we ate, so the traffic was quite low and noise wasn't noticeable.  Our family enjoyed the chicken sausage. It's an odd food and a nice piece to enjoy. The American and European foods were delicious and looked very appetizing. You might find the warm foods easier to down than the cold foods though. The cooler foods seemed to lack any bold definition in the flavor.  Stay away from the Asian foods. The hybrid sushi is interesting, but it is too dry to down. The fried rice was only so-so. The hybrid dumplings (which had steak in them) were the only memorable parts of the otherwise ordinary looking Asian foods. Avoid the miso soup(?). (It was a Japanese soup.)  The choice of desserts were just as bountiful as the choice of entrees (which were extensive to choose from). The cheesecake was very enjoyable and had a selection of flavors to try out. The ice cream was so-so. I would avoid the toppings, as they tasted slightly bland.  If given the luxury of another free visit, I would go again. Otherwise, I would look around, given that the price is 30$ a person per visit.",

On Monday they were doing some sort of construction, they covered the corner of the restaurant with a black tarp so you couldn't see what was going on... And they sat us right next to it. It was inconsiderate to seat us and other parties near the construction. It was loud and smelly. My other complaint is that they don't offer egg whites or turkey bacon, hence it being a basic buffet.",

Don't stand in line, buy your way in at the kiosk that is to the left of the line to pay.  For $27.99 you get all the champaign you can drink! Let's face it, two mimosas and breakfast will cost you that amount.  The buffet is full of great items including smoked salmon, shrimp, waffles, made to order omelet, desserts, Mexican food, and many other items! I loved the fresh fruit, salad bar, and peel and eat shrimp!  The champaign is free flowing.  The staff is very attentive and come by often. There is not a time limit on how long you can stay but don't over due it!   No doubt there are a number of buffets in Vegas but this is not a bad deal for a couple of hours to kill.",

I think that when you're working in a buffet with bottomless brunch at a casino that complaining about a noise level of a group is ridiculous when there's tons of empty tables at a buffet is ridiculous. They tried cutting us off one unlimited mimosas which felt almost anti customer focused. Our waiter was told by management not to give us anymore mimosas. We talked to Jeremy the manager and he was very accommodating to our frustrations and gave us another round of mimosas though we already felt like we weren't welcome. We'll come back but honestly watch your octave because apparently they're sensitive to that and I still think complaining about noise levels in vegas is ridiculous. John the waiter is the best!!!",

No, but it definitely hit the spot and we were full enough to make it through till lunch without having any other food.  Both of us enjoyed the hot fresh coffee and the staff there are all super nice.

We haven't eaten here in a while and were pleasantly surprised that most of the food was quite good with a wide variety.  Skip the sushi.

I was actually convinced not to try the buffet dinner last night because the reviews were so negative but decided to try it for lunch today just to see for myself.   I don't know what people are expecting but I thought it was very satisfactory; some people have compared it to Hometown buffet and that's kind of what I expect for a buffet and actually I thought the food was significantly a little better than Hometown buffet.  On a weekday for lunch it was only about $22 and I thought the meat from the carving station was better than expected. I thought the mashed potatoes and gravy were good and the service was generally good. The pizza and potstickers were the disappointments.  I wished it had a little more variety but I guess the full buffet isn't in effect for a weekday lunch and I didn't even try the desserts and i have read the desert are usually the best part.  I would repeat going if I were in the mood for a buffet. I don't know how much it costs on the weekends but I thought the weekday lunch was reasonable and repeatable.   I noticed the lines get long if you arrive late. I imagine it could be disappinting if you waited a long time and paid much more on a weekend, but I've noticed many places have long lines at 7pm, even McDonalds.",

Seriously two adults was $80 and that price didn't include alcohol. This would have been okay if the buffet had been amazing, but it wasn't. They had one small line of breakfast food that was not above the quality one gets at Denny's for $4.99. Other stuff was dry and/or cold and the selection was meager. They just don't give a crap and obviously this place exists for the people needing to use their comp points. After I walked inside, the first thing I thought to myself was \"I KNEW I SHOULD HAVE YELPED THIS PLACE FIRST!\" Als, it was too late.  Anyway, lesson learned. If you want food, find another place. I don't care if you just won $100,000, this is not worth it.",

    "text": "We were here to see Drew Carey's Improva-Ganza,  courtesy of KSNE radio, so we went to the Grand Buffet.  First visit here.    Everything looked good at first.  I was surprised to find a whole vegetarian section, and there was a nice assortment of Indian vegetable dishes, along with pappadum and mint sauce.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I love veggies, and Indian food is my absolute favorite.  But if cruise ships can do it well, MGM Grand ought to be able to, also.  HIRE AN INDIAN CHEF!!!  Everything I tried from that section was bland and tasteless, with not a hint of spice, or any kind of flavoring at all.  In fact, everything I tasted was woefully forgettable.    At first glance, the buffet looks big, but there aren't many selections in each category.  Three different kinds of cheese, three or four types of cold cuts.  The Mexican station had pre-made chicken fajita meat with some toppings, but didn't have the assortment of prepared dishes that even the lower-level Feast Buffets offer.  There were a couple of Chinese dishes, a couple of Italian pasta dishes (the lobster ravioli filling tasted like mashed potatoes.  I think the chef made a wrong turn and ended up in Idaho instead of the Pacific).  The desserts were just as bad.  A few sliced cakes, some of which looked like they'd been there since the flood (Noah's, not Australia's).  The cutesy desserts in the tiny decorative cups looked good, but weren't (What the hell WAS that thing they named \"Strawberry Tiramisu?\")  The soft-serve \"ice cream\" was cold soup, and the vanilla was a really peculiar yellow color.  Oh, but they had real ice cream!, the server behind the counter said.  How bad can mint chocolate chip be?  That, too, was devoid of any flavor, but aahh, the texture:  like chalk.  Or left out and refrozen.  MGM is too big to put their name on this poor excuse for a buffet.  I'm glad we didn't have to pay for it - it was offered spontaneously when I put in my two cents' at the Player's Club about the new M Life program, which is screwing us loyal but low-roller gamblers which, of course, is not revealed in their huge advertising campaign.  I very much appreciated the comp, and wish I could have written a glowing review, but this buffet is up there among the worst.",

It was mid-afternoon and there was no wait.  The place is clean and the service is good but the selection and quality of food needs improvement.  I wasn't the only person walking around with empty plates looking for something to fill it with.  Maybe there wasn't much food because it was lunch.  Perhaps their dinner selection is better but I don't think I'll return to this buffet.  Not worth the money.",

Other people were waiting in line for 30 to 40 minutes. SUCKERS!! They have a the biggest selection and choices i've ever seen in my life. They had a huge seafood selection which i like then they turkey for thankgiving. They had roast beef, ribs, sushi and Chinese food. The prices are pricey it was like $25 bucks for dinner but it was worth it because the food was  very delicious. This was probably the best buffett i've ever had.The only letdown is the bathroom is outside the buffett.",

I think the cooked crab legs with seasoning were tastier than the cold king crab legs you get from an actual server behind the buffet.  Note that the cooked legs in the regular buffet section are served warm.  The sushi is not too shabby.  The service, as far as drinks and plate clean-up go, was very good and earned a decent tip.

Entirely disappointing considering that this is a restaurant in Vegas, a city known (in part) for the delicious food.  The meal was complimentary- and yet I would never come back here again even if someone paid me to go.  I tried pretty much everything they had to offer and ended up pissed off that I wasted an hour and half of my time filling up on crappy food.  I should have went to the McDonald's at the food court instead.  Prime rib- tasted like beef jerky.  Crab legs- too salty as if they were trying to cover up something.  All the meat dishes tasted like rubber and the sauces tasted like plastic.  They had a taco bar.  Make your own tacos and it still tasted like crap.  The meat looked even worse than Taco Bell.  Who comes to a buffet to eat PIZZA?  Well I don't, but I decided to make an exception, figuring that no one could possibly fail at pizza.  Boy was I wrong... the crust was stale and none of the flavors tasted right.  Their lasagna tasted like Chef Boyardee.  I could keep going but then I'd never be able to finish this review...  The only part of the meal that was OK was the dessert bar.  Oh yea and my Coke and black tea tasted great too.  It befuddles me how they went so wrong.  I can't believe people pay for this place- I think dinner is about $25/person but then again I didn't pay attention since my meal was free.  Never again!  I'll pay the $35+ and go to the Wynn or Bellagio instead!",
