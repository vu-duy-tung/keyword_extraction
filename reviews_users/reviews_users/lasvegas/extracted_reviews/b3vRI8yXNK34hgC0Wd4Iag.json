I didn't want to pay $100 for dinner so when I came across the menu for Chin Chin, my friends and I decided to try it out. I ordered the sushi rolls and they came out really fast and it was really good. I spent around $30 and was very satisfied. I would definitely recommend it if you are looking for something not too fancy and affordable especially in Vegas.",

After leaving a nearby sushi place because of horrible service, my husband and I were famished and decided to just give this place a try since we were staying at NYNY anyway and didn't feel like going anywhere else to eat. Immediately, we were greeted by this very friendly hostess who showed us the menu, which is a mix of Chinese and Japanese. At that point I was \"Hangry\" and was about to eat whatever so we decided to get a table. We waited about 2-3 minutes and we're seated at a corner booth. In less than a minute, our server Robb came up to greet us right away. He was very friendly and asked us if we were celebrating anything. We ordered and I was surprised how big the rolls were! They both tasted good and was satisfied. After dinner they came up and gave us a very cute plate that had congratulations written in chocolate and a cheesecake to share. Looking around though, everyone looked very happy with their food and their portions are good on either menu. It's a great value for strip pricing and I cannot say enough praises for Robb and his trainee Natalie who were exceptionally amazing at what they do! The manager even took time to go around the tables asking everyone how everything is going! I am seriously impressed with this place and the staff they have here!",

However, I will give them 5 stars for service. The servers there were incredibly accommodating and made sure to take extra care of the people in our group who had certain food allergies.   We ordered the sampler appetizer platter, which had some good things like the egg rolls, but the other chicken dishes and dumplings were pretty boring...not bad...but not exciting either. The entrees of garlic eggplant and sweet crispy chicken...again good...buuuuttttt not \"oooo I want to come back and eat more of this\" good.   All in all, solid Chinese food, service excellent and atmosphere like a PF Changs, BUT when you're in a city like Vegas and there are so many other food options to explore, I would give Chin Chin a miss. The food just isn't that special for you to miss out on all the other great culinary experiences the city has to offer :)",

My dining companions split both the edamame and star wontons for appetizers.  Since I had eaten recently, I personally did not partake in either of them but my friends raved about both appetizers.  For my entree I decided upon the Mongolian beef.  Having ordered it the waiter informed me that I would not get rice with it and would I like to order a side of it. I politely declined. My Mongolian beef consisted of steak and chives in a sauce with crispy noodles, cucumber and carrots on the side.  The cut of meat was a little better than I was used to in such dishes and the sauce was good.  However I found the dish to be weird, especially the cucumber pieces.  The only other thing of note is that my friends ordered three sushi rolls.  They were disappointed with the size of them but raved about the flavors.  The bottom line for me is that I would probably not eat here again.  The food was just ok and I feel like better food could be found for the price.",

We shared the Chinese Chicken Salad which was nice and spicy and full of chicken.  We then shared the Peanut Noodles with Chicken which was also good, but I far preferred the salad.

Very simple, not too exciting, and variety is rather limited, but you get your brunch staples- scrambled eggs, scrambled eggs with duck, bacon, sausage, duck, bbq pork (chinese style), some potatoes, noodles. I actually prefer this to the $25 brunch buffett at MGM or similar casino. It's cheaper and i can never my $25 worth of food at 10:30 or 11 in the morning. And the food here is actually good. I like their duck scrambled egg, and their spring rolls and dumplings are yum too.  The line can get long, and with limited seats/ space, you can wait a bit. But people eat and go- so you are maybe made to wait for 30 min at most. And my other complaint would be you have to be in line to get your food, and since there is only 1 line of buffett trays, once you are done, you have to go back to the end of the line for round 2. It reminds me of being in the school cafeteria a little.   Solid 3.5 stars!",

The place wasn't even busy... When we finally got our food we were very disappointed.  The noodles were overpowered in soy sauce and the shrimp and scallops were over. cooked. The dumplings were absolutely tasteless.... I didn't dare send them back because I didn't want to wait another 30 minutes. I couldn't complain to the server anyway because after the food was dropped....we were forgotten about.... never again at this place .... I suggest you do the same",

    "text": "The wife and I had about an hour to kill before Zumanity. We were hungry, and didn't want to eat pizza or a sandwich. We saw Chin Chin and the sushi menu. Before we took the time to look at the menu, we sat down and then realized they didn't have any veggie only rolls on the menu. Instead of moving along, we decided to go with entrees instead.   I had the veggie lo mein, my wife had the peanut noodle dish. Both dishes were very fresh, not heavy on the sauce, and the noodles were the freshest I've ever had at any Chinese place. The veggies in the lo mein were perfect. Not overcooked, not undercooked. I could have just had broccoli in it. The peanut dish was \"spicy\" and had a great sweet tangy flavor. The food is very Americanized, so don't expect authentic...buts its on the Strip, what can you expect.   Our dishes were $14 and $13 respectively. The portion size of each would have been good for us to split. This would have been nice to know, and will be helpful if we go back. Since we were seeing a show after dinner, we didn't want to get a doggy bag.   My wife also had two cocktails - malibu and pineapple. They were $8 each. I had a Tsingtao bomber which was $8 which was actually not a bad deal.   The service was really good, and both the bartenders were very friendly. We had a nice chat with both of them.   As we don't eat on the Strip often, it is good to know we can get a semi reasonable and delicious meal.",

    "text": "My wife and I ate at Chin Chin one evening in Vegas when we had already settled into our hotel for the evening. I was a little worried, because we based a lot of our dining and activity choices on reviews, including Yelp, and Chin Chin wasn't especially well received.    My own exposure to authentic Chinese is limited, so that wasn't  a huge factor for us. The food was very tasty; basically just a significantly improved version of the Chinese food we can get in mid-Michigan. My wife had Orange Chicken and I had Pad Thai. We both thoroughly enjoyed our meal, though I had nothing to compare the Pad Thai to I can attest that the Orange Chicken was head and shoulders above any I'd had in the past.  We also had an appetizer sampler (assorted delights I think) that was very satisfying. I would recommend it if you are more concerned about flavor than authenticity.",

They seemed a little understaffed when we were there on a Monday at lunch time because our waiter kept disappearing, but he was very nice and accomodating.  The food is just average...nothing amazing or overly tasty.  I ordered the chicken lo mein and literally had 3 pieces of chicken in my dish.  I was starving and was really wanting that chicken!!!  The noodles and veggies in the dish were bland...not seasoned well, if at all.  Others at our table had similar feelings about their dishes.  The portions are large...enough that two people could share and the prices are reasonable.  However, the food is just missing its mark.  I would not go out of my way to recommend Chin Chin to anyone and doubt I would return.",

I understand Japanese cuisine can be pricey due to quality but this establishment took it too far especially when it's not a fine dining restaurant. As I was looking over the menu for possible sushi ordering, I was blown away by the prices. For example: 1 order (2 pcs) of a tuna nigiri was $12.50! That would've been like 2 orders (4 pcs) for me if I were to dine in at a casual restaurant like this one in Sacramento, CA. I just ended up getting a small entree instead since I rather pay that same price to fill up my stomach. Service was ok but not so great - it took them a while to greet me and ask for drinks and then it took a while to place my order in.",

There was barely any flavor and our total came out to $27 for the entree and two scoops of rice. I would have rather have had Panda Express.  Oh...and there was some sort of problem going on in the back of the hotel which caused a disgusting aroma that smelled like sewer/poop to sweep through the restaurant and throughout the casino. It was pretty gross and most customers, like us, ended up taking the food to go. It wasn't their fault for the smell...but yikes...it made it very hard to enjoy the food if you sat down to eat it.",

Hubbie enjoyed his beef thus the star again!     I can't say anymore or else I'll drop it another star....",

We thought it was a good deal since most single entrees are $15, and the buffet was approx $19.  The buffet isn't HUGE like your exclusive hotel buffets, but it's just the right size.   I expected the food to taste like your typical greasy inauthentic Chinese food, but I was wrong! The food was light, not too salty and had just the right amount of everything.  Ooooo and their dessert bar was to die for! I liked everything here. The service was wonderful and I'd eat here again.",

Rice was delicious along with the salad but the bbq pork was gross it had lots of fat on it. I would avoid this item ... Our server was good when he was around he took a bit of time to bring water. The manager came over and removed the bbq pork from our check. She was very friendly and had a nice smile. You kinda felt like she was your friend once you left this place. Great job manger person. Over all the place is clean and has a cool vibe.",

The chocolate cake was good, but the sushi tasted like it was prepared in the morning and had been sitting out all day. Not fresh at all. The spicy tuna was so over the top spicy, we sent it back.  The reason for my review now though is the most frustrating of all: my credit card was just charged on 7/9/15. Two and a half weeks later! I was about to call my bank for fraud when I realized what the charge was. I've never had a charge take that long to show up on my card! Just seems so ridiculous to wait that long and my statement says it was authorized 7/8/15. Not sure what is going on here, but I would avoid it due to old sushi, slow service, and now, apparently, lack of processing cards in a timely fashion!",

Everything was simply delicious  and beautifully served!  we didn't  leave a crumb on a plate :). The service was wonderful!  They exceeded our expectations!  the price is also reasonable. I want to add,because we had lunch buffet in this restaurant next day,and it was amazing!  We got the discount coupon 20%,so again it very responsibly priced and we had high quality tasty food! We enjoyed every bit! The service was exceptional. Every staff member is very nice and courteous!  Thank you guys!!!We will be back next time we in Vegas!  :)",

However, tonight, I was served wontons with RAW chicken inside. It was dark pink mush. The chef cooked a new batch for me, but unfortunately I had already eaten half of one. They were quite apologetic and comped our meal, but no amount of comped money is worth the risk of salmonella. It's a sadly inexcusable mistake and it's why I'm giving my rating 1 star. Here's to hoping I dodge the diarrhea bullet - my plane flight is in 48 hrs.",

Very friendly service, and all four items - Chinese chicken salad, shumai, cilantro dumplings, and Yang Chow fried rice - were great. The salad was dressed perfectly and had lots of chicken. The shumai might have been the best item. The fried rice was prepared without soy sauce (as the menu indicated) so it could have been bland but we liked it a lot. Last visit might have been ten years ago and I remember thinking the salad and dumplings were not as good as my first experience decades ago in Studio City. This time it rocked. We will definitely stop by next time we're in Vegas.",

There was also BBQ pork or something but for breakfast?  Yeah... I thought it was weird.  They had fruit and yogurt which seemed like it was made.  I was surprised a lot of people were eating here for breakfast even though there wasn't a lot of choices.

We landed at Chin Chin for some good old Americanized Chinese food.  Since our last meal was breakfast we ordered up some chicken pot stickers, pork bao, half of a Hunan chicken, and Mongolian beef...and some steamed rice (more on that later).  It was all good.  The Mongolian beef was actually very good.  I am usually a little scared of the beef that ends up in Chinese food dishes, but this was very tasty.    The Hunan chicken was a little tart for me, but it was nice and tender.  My wife loved it.    If you are a char siu bao fan (yeah that is spelled a hundred different ways), don't order them here.  The filling was off and the dough of the bun was heavy and yellow.  My guess is that they were made a while before we ordered them and steamed up to serve.  By a while I mean at the day before...or earlier...  The portions are pretty good, so if you eat family style don't over order.  One dish per person is plenty.    The prices were about $15 per entree, which isn't bad for a hotel on the strip.  Important note, rice does not come with your meal.  You have to order it by the bowl for $1.50 each or get fried rice.  That's kind of lame.  You really need to charge that extra $1.50 for a bowl of steamed rice?  Our server was a polite girl from some former Soviet block country.  Theek accent, but attentive to the table.",

We were staying at NY NY and got off the elevators at 930am after a long night and saw \"Chinese Buffet Brunch!\"  Now, why on earth did I think Chinese buffet - for breakfast - would be a good idea?  I'll never know.  The place was packed though, so I followed the leader.  5 minutes after eating, I had to run back up to my hotel room and then  spend the next hour on the bed clutching my stomach.  Yeah.  And don't blame it on the booze the night before... I wasn't even hungover when I woke up.  Lesson learned.",

It was fast, delicious, and came with good service and lots of free Coke refills.  If you like PF Chang's, you'll like Chin Chin.   P.S. Whoever said it is a little pricey is a little crazy.

The girl at the front desk told us to try New York, New York, and man, I love her for suggesting it.  It was so delicious and the service was so wonderful, we ended up coming back a second time, before our flight home.  Everything on the menu was delicious, but I have to recommend most of all the Velvet Chicken soup (they put peas in it! so cool!) and the Hot Sour Soup. Both were authentic twists on old favorites, and so good we actually had to get seconds. Perfect for helping with a hangover.  Also on the list: Any of their lo mein. Delicious, chock-full of goodies, and never greasy. Mmm mm!",

I don't think we have any reason to return, $11 for a 16oz draft...$9 for a small wonton soup, and $20+ per sushi roll. Too pricey when Vegas has a lot of competitor restaurants.",

The spicy garlic tomato beef is unlike anything I've had an a Chinese restaurant anywhere and it's almost like a cross between an Italian and Chinese dish. It was unique and enjoyable.

I was a little surprised at the quality of the shimp they used in the Kung Pao dish, as they were much smaller in size than I have ever had at the LA locations.

My hubby had sushi and I had a piece and it was good except the very fishy seaweed wrap. We are really into fresh yummy seafood and sushi and that by far was YUCK.    Then the bill came holy S&%$!!!! $75 for two barely meals WTF! OK its Vegas... I get it but Really we just took it! It will never happen again here or ever!!!

What they DON'T tell you is that you can't use the complimentary bloody mary and mamosa special at the same time. My wife and I don't even like those drinks, but we thought since it was a comp of their breakfast specials we gave them a shot but only took two sips and left them.  Our waiter was straight horrible and even lied to us when my wife had asked for more orange juice... after 15 minutes of walking past us he finally came back and said they were \"out of orange juice\" and then 2 minutes later a waitress at another table was FUCKING SERVING ORANGE JUICE!!!! I couldn't believe it.   Once I finally got our check of course was when I realized and finally found out that I was charged for two breakfasts and had the shitty drinks comped. Ultimately, he let me do the 2x1 since it was cheaper and I ended up paying for the drinks just to get out of there.   Maybe the lunch/dinner vibe is better but I definitely wouldn't recommend this place for breakfast. All in all, we spent 2 hours to eat something we could've finished at Denny's in 30 minutes. Never again, dude.",

There were waffles, French toast, scrambled eggs, sausage and bacon. They had red velvet pancakes which were really good because they weren't too sweet. You also have the option of ordering an egg or omelette anyway you want it.   Overall, I thought it was a good breakfast buffet. I would come back here.",

Food: the seamed chicken dumplings was out choice for our free dim sum, they were so good they didn't need any sauce! The orange chicken was what my husband and I SHARED for dinner with 2 bowls of steamed rice. Just delicious!!!! They made our daughters chicken without sauce so she was very happy. Lastly we ordered mochi for dessert, it was not like the mochi we had eaten before but was good. We only tried the raspberry flavor but it was pretty good, it was a good small sharing dessert.

And if you check in on yelp, you can get a 2-4-1 priced lunch buffet. Sounds good.  I have had some of the best service ever while living in Las Vegas, and here was no exception. The hostess greeted us quickly and cheerfully, the waiter was great, we were off to a good start!  The lunch buffet was fine, nothing special to be honest. But what do you want for $19.95? None of us were impressed. We worked our way though a few items, even though it was 12:30 in the afternoon, the selection felt a little picked over. It was fine for a quick and easy bite.  The \"dessert\" are was colorful, but almost everything we tried was hard or stale. With the exception off the \"cookie sandwiches\" they were really great, and fresh.  After reading the reviews, I am thinking that ordering off the menu might be a better way to go. Next time, if there is one....I will try that.",

    "text": "I was disappointed in my last outing to Chin Chin.  A large Hot & Sour Soup with shredded pork, carrots, green onions, tofu, jalapenos, and egg that I consumed myself was very good, and slightly crisp Chicken Spring Roll wrappers were good, but the insides were just okay and not very flavorful.  I had to keep dipping the deep-fried morsels in Sweet & Sour Sauce to enjoy some taste.  From now on I will stick to Vegetable or Shrimp Spring Rolls.    Shrimp with Garlic & Snow Peas featured good-sized, succulent shrimp, tasty snow peas, and small mushroom pieces, but I could have done without the carrots, and would have enjoyed a delicate crystal White Sauce better than the dark Brown Sauce with which the dish was immersed.  Cashew Shrimp was prepared with a much lighter Brown Sauce that I liked a whole lot better.  I can only describe the Orange Chicken as weird.  It consisted of large chunks of chicken, peppers, and onions glazed with an Orange Sauce but not at all typical for this breed of Cantonese fare.  Szechuan String Beans were okay but unremarkable.  Most disappointing of all was Small Egg-Fried Rice with scallions.  The rice was richly bathed in soy-based Brown Sauce, and at first sighting had no visible egg in it.  I pointed this out to my server, and he volunteered to take back the dish and have more egg added, which I let him do.  Although improved, even upon its return the rice did not sport much egg.  Hot Tea was good, and our pot lasted quite awhile.  But by the end of our dinner, even an unusual Chocolate Dome, consisting of Dark Chocolate Ganache that exposed Chocolate Mousse and white cake inside that was possibly honey-soaked after being cracked open, could not save the day for this rather ordinary meal.  Our server was very good and accommodating.  And our surroundings that featured dark woods and white-linen tablecloths were comfortable and pleasant.  But there are just too many other better Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas that I have now experienced for me to go out of my way to return here.",

He was friendly, prompt, knowledgeable, and great overall. We will definitely make this an every trip stop before we head home Sundays. My only complaint was the restaurant was fairly small but the food and service make up for that. Worth the try--highly recommend it.",

The menu is full of the food that you'd find in any local Americanized Chinese take out place along with various other Asian foods like Sushi and Pad Thai.  I didn't see any Pho or Bulgogi and I was almost expecting them.  I hadn't eaten all day and because the underwhelming size of a previous meal at the nearby Gonzales y Gonzales, I may have ordered too much.  I got a Spicy Rainbow Roll and the Peanut Noodles.  They were both good, larger than I expected, and not under-spiced. Even better, I didn't wake up thirsty in the middle of the night because of too much salt or MSG.  I would have liked to see more sushi and sashimi options, but to complain about it at a Chinese restaurant seems weird.  I would have also have liked to try something that I couldn't get at home and sadly, the Peanut Noodles were about as close as I could get.",

My boyfriend ordered the noodle dish with pork and it was very good probably my favorite thing at the table. Service was very friendly and funny but it was also hard to find him. Drinks constantly empty. Waited a long time to receive our ticket. Food came out uncoordinated, because half comes from the kitchen and the other half from the sushi area so by the time we got our rolls the other side of the table was done eating",

    "text": "This is honestly a hidden gem in Vegas. I'm always skeptical of Chinese restaurants (being Chinese myself), but the food here is top-notch quality and mirrors what I typically eat with my fam.  We had the AYCE lunch buffet during my visit. We sat at the bar and was served by Kayli. She was very friendly and knowledgable -- she knew exactly what the dishes were (ppl beside us kept asking what sushi dishes they had). Kayli also knew her drinks and was able to whip up a dragon fruit mojito for me, which was not on the drink menu and was very well balanced and not too strong.  Food wise, I highly recommend the DIY lettuce wraps, and the BBQ Pork (SOOO GOOD). The fried rice was also amazing but a bit salty. Since they only had a small selection, I was able to try a bit of everything and it was amazing. They had all of the staples like shrimp and celery, 3x fried rice, chow mein, mango chicken, etc. Epic place and I'm glad I found it!   (Note - the one missing star is because of the small selection, and it was actually quite difficult to find in NY NY)",

I had a drink but don't remember the name and couldn't find it on the online menu but it was something about a dragon. Made with Absolute Apple vodka, cucumber soda and ginger beer. It was delicious.   The service was fast and it was great. I had no complaints about the service at all!    I'll be back.",

In short this place is trying to be upscale but it should be noted that it is affordable and they serve you huge portions thus the prior reviewers reference to PFChang's.    We ordered two entrees, a rice dish, and an appetizer but really we should have only ordered the two entrees since we only finished about 1/4 of all the food we had.  We were sad the food was going to waste because normally we would've love to take a doggie bag home but were starting our night out and did'nt want to lug our food all the way back to our room at Planet Hollywood.  Anyways, the server was great and was'nt too hovering or distant.  All in all we had a wonderful dinner here but we were sad to see 3/4 of the food at the table since were stuffed !",

Several hours later, my companion was throwing up for the next 4 hours. Had to seek medical attention, a doctor was called to our room. My companion was trapped in the room for the next 2 days, dehydrated and too weak to travel. She could not eat at all, and we just stayed in. On the second day, I felt ill as well. This turned out to be a very expensive lunch, as the Doctor and the meds cost a large amount of money. So much for our vacation ! It was ruined, and we just left and drove back to L.A.. Since then (and it has been about 3 1/2 weeks since) Chin Chin management has not called back to discuss after I made reports to NY NY Risk Management Dept. I was told by NY NY that they lease and they passed the buck to Chin Chin, saying that they aren't directly responsible. All I can say is BEWARE of eating here ! My next call will be to the Nevada Health Dept. as I am getting no responses from either Chin Chin corporate or NY NY.",

First of all, we ordered some hot tea only to be served in dirty glasses.  Our waiter did not seem to care (he seemed to really not care about his job in general).   We placed our order, and then a few minutes later he came back to tell us they do not have any Pad Thai.  He asked us if we wanted something else instead, but how would we know if we no longer had menus in front of us? SO,  we asked to see menus again.  He totally forgot and we had to remind him twice to bring us menus.  (We did order one sushi roll which was pretty decent).  We picked a seafood noodle dish which was EXTREMELY spicy to our surprise.  Like the hot pepper shaker just totally spilled out all over the noodles.   Try to avoid this place at NY NY if possible. There are much better Asian options elsewhere.",

The variety of food was good and the quality is on par with Panda Express. The entrees included Kung Pow Chicken, Beef & Broccoli, General Taos Chicken with soup, rice, egg rolls, salad, 4 types of sushi rolls and a variety of dessert items. The service was very friendly and attentive. We stayed away from ordering sushi as it was too expensive for what little you were offered.",

I took the chance this past weekend to celebrate my wife's Birthday together with the birthday of one of my oldest friend who was visiting from the UK for the first Las Vegas together with his family.  I want to say that the experience we had was great, the branch's management and stuff (Cory, Erick & Chris) were very attentive and the food got to our table at the right time tasting great.  Now I'll always visit them in Las Vegas to have a great meal!!!",

(Those that didn't love it complained their selections were over-salty and pretty greasy.)  We all found the staff really friendly and on top of their game though, and loved that (like most anywhere in Vegas) we could bring in outside booze we were consuming at the time and finish it with our dinner. Food came out quick too, which was great as we were time sensitive about to shoot off to see a show.",

We decided to try the orange chicken w/ white rice and Mongolian beef w/ noodles. They were both extremely good. No soy sauce needed. I highly recommend this place and ask for Scott B!!!",

I ordered take out and it was ready in 15-20 minutes. I recommend the assorted pleasures. It's a 8-piece appetizer, so you can get a little taste of different things. Like their egg roll, wontons, and the gift wrap chicken - which was soo tasty. Enjoy!",

Not really asian food. Chicken strips, mac n cheese, french fries, and an \"asian\" salad that is shredded lettuce + chips is authentic?   They offered sushi but each of the 2-3 trays had very few pieces left to pick from. I'd say the items that were good were the desserts. The cut fruits were fresh and ripe.   The spring rolls had been sitting out for a while because the spring roll wrapping was hardened when my mom ate it.   Everyone was very polite and welcoming but the service was kinda slow. Our waitress disappeared for a while and we were waiting for our check.   It was about $24 per person for lunch and our bill for 3 people + tax + tip came out to be $87.   They also have a regular menu that you can order from but i don't think we'd be back to try it.",

My suggestion - skip the buffet and order off of the breakfast menu. We did the buffet the first day and it was good. But it was the typical $25 and we don't gorge ourselves so we didn't feel we got much of a return for our money. The next two days we ordered off the menu. Great $10 omelletes that come with toast and a choice of potatoes or fruit. Very filling and much more wallet friendly. The service was top notch.  We go to Vegas every year and Chin Chin will be in the rotation going forward.",

Hubby and I decided to try this place out for a late night dinner on Sunday (thank you hunger and alcohol!), and I was impressed. I decided to try and keep things healthy since I had stuffed myself the night before at a buffet, so I opted for the California roll with brown rice (kudos for having brown rice available) and hubby got the broccoli beef.  The portions here are definitely huge, both the roll and entree. I thought the roll was good, nothing amazing, but good. Hubby thought the broccoli beef was also good, just wished there was less sauce. That's on us though, we should have asked for light sauce.   Our server was nice and attentive.  Of course this place is a little pricey for the quality of food, but what in Vegas isn't overpriced.   I would come back if I'm hungry and in the Casino.",

Also, to the people who are upset and saying that they are disappointed that it wasn't authentic Chinese...Chin Chin doesn't promote themselves as authentic Chinese. It is americanized Chinese and it is delicious.  I went to the sunset location in Los Angeles for many many years.  Coming to this Las Vegas location is difficult because it is on the strip, but it is 100% worth it. I usually just get their Chinese chicken salad and Szechuan dumplings.  I get extra sauce on the side because that cilantro sauce is like no other. I can literally eat it with a spoon. Occasionally I'll order a cup of soup and Mongolian beef.  This location also has a buffet option and sushi options.  Sushi is fresh and delicious.  I would recommend using the buffet for sushi because there is a lot of option. Overall Chin Chin is great and I recommend it to everyone!",

There was no response. I emailed the corporate office - still no response. Finally, I called \"food and beverage\" at New York New York . They contacted the Chin Chin manager and she called me say she regretted our experience. She also said she would add more meats next time. Too bad there won't be a \"next time\".   This is the email I sent:  While staying at NY NY in Las Vegas, my son and his girlfriend  treated me and my wife to dinner at the hotel. It was convenient and we were in the mood for Chinese food. To the point, it was the most disappointing Chinese food we have ever had. The Sushi was awful, the Chinese chicken salad was almost lacking of chicken - there was hardly any there. The King Pao chicken/shrimp[/beef was little more than a pile of chestnuts and peanuts. There were only a few shrimp, and a few pieces of beef and chicken. The tuna tartar was also disappointing. Our dinner was a sham. You are charging enough; you don't have to skimp with fillers. If it were just my wife and me, we would have walked out, but we were guests. In the end, you have 4 very unhappy customers.  Any other Chinese restaurant in Vegas would be better (and much cheaper) than Chin Chin.",

The noodles had a bad texture and flavor; they tasted old & gummy.  The orange chicken was pretty good, I stuck with that & my rice, which they charge extra for.  Most Chinese restaurants include rice with their entrees.  Our party of four had a bill of $66.97 & that was without drinks (only 1 in the group had a pot of hot tea).

The wontons were flavorful and tender. Anthony's Noodles were also very delicious, the flavor was lightly spicy and heavy with the taste of cilantro.   Far from traditional, but that's not what you're here for (traditional can be found on Spring Mountain, the chinatown plaza). Portions are huge, the grease is great for building up the required barrier in your stomach required for heavy drinking! Will definitely be back for more when we're back in town in November.",

Please note, I am Chinese myself. I'm no masterchef but this is by far the worst \"Asian\" restaurant I have been to. My hot and sour soup was extremely peppery, too thick and not the correct colour. Our beans and chicken dishes were covered in salt. Our summer rolls were not fresh. I could tell it was taken out of the fridge and cut up to be served. The rice was dry. I have never been so reluctant to finish my food. The only thing that was made right was our spicy tuna sushi. Nonetheless, the customer service was good as it always is in America. We reluctantly told the manager when asked how our meal was. When asking for the bill, we received a discount for the dishes we were particularly not happy with, which was nice.

The food was delicious and just the right amount. Jordan was very attentive and a pleasure to talk with during lunch. The highlight of our lunch was Jordan bringing the Wife and I a slice of cheesecake to share in honor of our anniversary we would celebrate the following day. The cheesecake was delicious and a pleasant surprise to say the least. Just want to thank Jordan again for the awesome service and we will be back for sure during our next trip to Sin City!

There were lots of options for both meat lovers and vegetarians alike. The cocktail list was also amazing and we enjoyed trying a few new things. As Joanna K. said, the ginger martini was amazing!   As for the food itself, the prices were very reasonable ($10-15) and the portions were plenty big. I would certainly recommend to anyone wanting Chinese food that isn't greasy and won't kill your wallet!",

They were doing a fundraiser for saint baldricks for children cancer.  I won a free dim sum! Linda the manager was so friendly! Definately making this place a regular lunch spot!",

Free refills on tea and soda and the service was fast and friendly.  But seriously, that \"pork belly\" was bad.  Bad enough that I only took two bites, one excitedly and the next one to make sure that yes in fact that was totally tasteless pork loin they were trying to pass off as pork belly.   Bad enough to only give Chin Chin 1 star.",

Glad we decided to eat there because the breakfast menu was excellent. From 2 types of eggs Benedict (salmon and crab) to different styles of potatoes and everything in between, this was a million times better than the crappy free brunch buffet at the Monte Carlo.  What made it even better was our waiter, Jordan. Not only did he take it upon himself to water down my son's lemonade for him (because it tends to be too sweet), he also took a few minutes to stop and chit chat with us. He gave us suggestions for things to do suitable for my 6 year old. So cute! :)  The manager even offered us to stay and try out their lunch menu (at no extra cost) because we arrived late for breakfast. I was pretty full from what I had already eaten, but did try a bit of their Chinese food lunch buffet. I tried the orange chicken, sweet and sour soup, and egg roll which was also yum yum yummy!   Great service + great food = 5 stars!",

    "text": "First...the bad. One of the chairs was broken and when my wife sat down a piece fell off, the chair shifted and pinched her hand to the point of drawing blood.  Never a good start but it did go better after that.  The staff was sincerely mortified and got us the requisite bandaids and towlette.  So on with the meal ( a little blood is not gonna get between us and Sushi).  We ordered entirely from the sushi bar so I can't speak to the Asian fusion kitchen.  We ordered 4 different rolls and some Hamachi sashimi. The Hamachi was fresh and fileted into elegant ribbons.  It looked so beautiful I almost felt bad about eating it.  Until I took the first bite.  After that it could've been the Mona Lisa and and I would've scarfed it down frame and all. There was not a bad roll out of the 4.  The rice was spot on Sushi grade.  Crisp veggies and fresh fish.  The flavors were carefully balanced to keep the focus on the ingredients rather than bury them in sauces.   Service was outstanding ( but the whole bleeding thing kinda makes for attention afterwards). I don't normally do desserts  (just not my thing).  However, they brought us complementary cheesecake and chocolate cake by way of apology.  I don't tolerate sweets well and these were so rich and decadent I was only able to do a few bites.  Well, I may not like sweet and rich but for those who do I highly recommend both.  I'm quite sure the cake will be outlawed once the government finds out about it.  It is the opium of desserts. They do need to pay closer attention to the condition of their furniture.  They are aging and honestly we had a sense of humor about it but it could have been really not funny. Despite that we all enjoyed the meal tremendously and spent the next few hours in a Sushi induced coma.",

We should have checked it out first. Absolutely pitiful. Dishes had zero flavor and most were lukewarm at best. Selection was terrible. And most items were pretty close to empty the entire time. Keep in mind this was at noon!  Gave 2 stars due to fine service. Other than that stay away!!!",

    "text": "Tastes just like home!  While roaming the Las Vegas Strip on our last day, we wanted to eat somewhere that was close to our comfort food. Being away from the island for about a week, you tend to miss food from there. In my case, my type of \"local food\" isn't a spam musubi or loco moco. I actually wanted to eat Asian food. Walking through New York New York after visiting the Hershey Store, I wanted to steer clear of the oily, fast food pizza and fried delicacies.   Thankfully, one of the Chin Chin host/hostess were outside holding up their menu. Can't miss them. They are strategically standing right in front of the \"We're still open during construction\" words on the wall. We perused the menu and when the hostess said they mainly serve Japanese, Chinese and Dim Sum I was sold.  We walked with her to the entrance to the restaurant and waited a few minutes for a table to get cleaned. Our waiter Rob was really punctual and energetic. He showed us where the beverages were and the libation menu too. We settled for non-alcoholic drinks. Yes, I know....BORING but we were catching a flight that night and I still needed to pack.   After contemplating the selections and reminding myself that my eyes were bigger than my stomach, we decided on the Szechuan Dumplings, Hot & Sour Soup, Pepper Steak, and Peanut Noodles. It wasn't long until our soup was sitting in front of us, waiting to be ladled up. This soup was delicious. Being of Asian descent, I feel like I'm a bit more particular on my \"Asian\" foods especially away from the motherland. The soup was the perfect amount of spicy and sour. It was very well balanced in flavor and we just wanted to drink it all up.   Next on deck came the Pepper Steak. Now this might not be the most praised review on the Pepper Steak because I'm not a fan of bell peppers. This steak was oh-so juicy and the spiciness of the steak was minimal. There was so much bell pepper flavor that it overpowered even the onions. This was definitely my husband's favorite of the four dishes ordered.  The Peanut Noodles and Szechuan Dumplings were delivered at the exact same time. Let's talk dumplings! If you've had dumplings at a dim sum place, they are not usually covered in the sauce. Well, these were not your usual dumplings. The size of the dumplings were the same but these things were smothered in a cilantro sauce. When taking the first bite into the dumpling, you definite taste the cilantro but you also taste something sweet. Very unusual for dim sum. These babies were the highlight for me. Because of its unique taste, it will be forever remembered.   The Peanut Noodles can be ordered with either chicken or shrimp but we felt like going plain jane with these. At first glance, the noodles glisten with the peanut sauce. Be careful of that first bite, it's thicker than it looks. If you want something filling, then order the peanut noodles. They will quickly fill you up but only order it if you love peanuts and or peanut butter. That is really what you are eating. These weren't that spicy. I think if you can stand a little heat, like a tease of heat then you should be ok.   It was great discovering this new restaurant on the strip. I can't wait to go back and see it after the construction/renovation. Be daring, be bold and try Chin Chin.",

Out comes the rice AGAIN... rice only NO EGG! Are you kidding me?! In an effort to not waste anymore food, I said I would take it home and add my own egg. Then came my family's \"to go\" order (salad, dressing on the side). Of course, the salad was tossed with the dressing. I don't want soggy salads as I have a long drive home. Now comes the bill... They were charging me for every order of rice that was re-made! As I spoke to the manager about the extra charges and complained, all she offered was to remove the rice charge!

If you happen to be traveling with kids who aren't crazy about Asian food, they also have macaroni & cheese and chicken strips to keep the little ones happy while mom and dad feast on sushi (veggie rolls, Philly rolls and California rolls) and tons of Chinese favorites.  They have the stuff you crave as well as some really healthy choices if you've already put a little too much Vegas in your Vegas trip and you need some veggies.

Unlike most places, the wontons were packed with cream cheese! So good! For dinner I had the Tomato Garlic Chicken it was DELICIOUS! So flavorful with a lot of chicken, water chestnuts and green bell peppers. The others I was with ordered Kung Pao Chicken, California Rolls, and Lo Mein. Everything was excellent And our dishes came with a choice of brown, white or fried rice. The service on the other hand was slow as molasses.  Not to mention our waiter was just completely rude, I would say however I would come back for the food, but they need to do something with their staff!",

She was courteous and kind and her service and conversation was just wonderful. Then if that wasnt enough I ordered sushi and it was wonderful. Naty's sushi creations and artwork were absolutely Beautiful. He made my tuna sushi look like a pepperoni pizza!!!! and the quality of the fish was fresh. Both of them had great smiles and personalities and I would def recommend dining there alone or with a group.   P.S. I had the pleasure of meeting Mr.Chin and was able to shake his hand and tell him what wonderful employees he has :-)",

My girlfriend ordered the Mongolian beef, and in my opinion it wasn't bad but the steak was really thick, and was only served on the crispy white rice noodles, with nothing else.  Overall, maybe not bad for a pop-in type situation, but I'd personally probably find someplace else if you wanted a better experience.",

    "text": "Next time someone says to go to Chin Chin, I'm probably gonna have to say No No, unless I'm adamant on having something resembling Chinese food and am physically unable to go elsewhere.  I had eaten here for dinner a couple years ago and would have said it was A-OK.  You're looking for Chinese food on The Strip at a restaurant and it's not like there's lots to choose from. There's the chain PF Chang's (which is better than Chin Chin actually) at Planet Hollywood, and Pearl at MGM (which is a lot more expensive and you get less food), but not a whole lot else.   On my recent visit, I was trying for a lunch under $20 and it's possible here.  Many of the dishes are about $13, like the Chicken Chow Fun with Black Bean Sauce.  It was ok, I've experienced better, but it's not like I struggled to eat it. I'm a critic of noodles these days, so accepted them for what they were.  As for the har gow I ordered for $8.25 (you get 5 of them) it was the worst dim sum I've ever had.  I don't think I've used such terminology in a review before.  I know I was spoiled in SF Chinatown the other week, but this tasted nothing like dim sum.  I couldn't believe it, it was pretty terrible to the point it's hard to describe it.  It almost had a sweet taste to it, and not in a good way.  Major regret, I would've been better off just getting the noodles (and would have managed to get out for less than $20) but when I see dim sum on the menu it's hard to resist.  After having that, there's nothing I could do now but resist it.  I'd tape my mouth shut to prevent it from ever getting into my mouth again.",

He had a great laugh, very attentive and engaging. Our food - from appetizer to a scrumptious chocolate-maple cake were perfect. The velvet corn soup and tangerine chicken hit the spot.

They remodeled since my last visit and the space is now incredibly bright & loud/noisy. The brunch menu has changed with less selection only having signature omelets or build your own. Speaking of menus, they handed us menus that were filthy. We sat at the bar and the staff seemed disorganized. The omelet I ordered never arrived, when I asked about it they promptly brought something that I didn't order. I ended up just eating off the buffet. Their buffet has always been \"OK\" with typical breakfast items but felt their strength was the menu. I have always liked their $5 bloody mary's. The manager did comp one of our meals since mine never arrived and asked that we come back to give them another try. I don't think I will be back not just because of this meal, but the space is not as quaint & quiet as it once was.",

I could already tell by biting into the rolls that they were not fresh. However, my waiter was very efficient and attentive which made the eating experience pleasurable. Then, the next morning, I had their breakfast buffet which was also okay. The selection of their buffet was quite limited including the traditional fare of eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns. These items were okay. As for appearances, the breakfast was not too appetizing. Also, they had two choices of cereal but there was only actually one available. Also, they only had whole milk. Again, at least my waitress was quite friendly and attentive.",

Our server Jordan was extremely attentive and was there before I even knew I needed something. He was talkative and very energetic which in the field of hospitality is a much needed asset. Linda was the manager and she visited the table and was very kind to myself and my girlfriend. Can't wait to come back next time.",

    "text": "I was slightly underwhelmed by this place. I had mistakenly ordered their Monkey Brain, which turned out to be a hollowed out avocado stuffed with who-knows-what... When I informed the waitress that I anticipated an actual roll, she gladly provided me with the menu so I could make a selection of something I'd eat but neglected to remove the Monkey Brain from my receipt, which I did not eat any of. It would have been nice if she would have informed me that I was ordering something other than a roll, obviously not being from around Vegas.. SO that was $9 wasted.  On a positive note, my cup of hot and sour soup was pretty delicious and the second item that I ordered was the NY Roll.. It was okay - I was only able to eat half of it by the time I finally got it to the table.  Drink prices were insane, so we skipped on those.  Overall I feel like this place is way overpriced for mediocre food. It'd be a hard sell getting me back in here again.",

    "text": "You don't come to New York New York for the Chinese food.  But if you find yourself needing some, this is probably the best and only alternative within the hotel.  Located right in front of the New Yorker Tower is Chin Chin.  Now it can be a bit confusing to see the name then to also notice the sushi bar inside is kinda confusing... so you would think this place is fusion themed but it's not. Service was great!  Our waiter knew to match our vibe and he was spittin out jokes and was pretty entertaining.   Onto our dishes: Sweet & Sour Pork - Very good!  I actually found myself eating the veggies more than the pork which is unlike me.  The veggies were fresh and crispy!  Just the right amount of sauce and rice is oh so good! BBQ Pork - Always a favorite of mine.  This was juicy and tangy just how I like it. Tsao Chicken - This is always a crowd pleaser.  The tanginess and tartness of this dish just goes so well with any rice dish.  Probably my favorite dish of the bunch. Shrimp Fried Rice - Talk about an abundance of shrimp.  There was literally 2-3 shrimps in every spoonful!   So I give this place a solid 3 stars.  For the location and convenience, it's definitely something to consider.  The price for each dish ranges from $8 - $15 which is reasonable given you're in a Las Vegas hotel.  If the portions were only a tad larger, then this would've been 4 stars.",

We started with a large bowl of Hot and Sour soup, which was enough to feed four people. I found the taste above-average and very enjoyable.  We also had the pork steamed dumplings with sauce. This dish was pretty much like any steamed dumpling I've had (not bad). The garlic soy sauce was very good.  For my meal I had the peanut noodles without chicken. They were delicious! I've always like peanut flavors in Asian food, but this was the first dish I've tried that was centered around it. It's a simple-looking dish and the flavor just stands out. There was enough for me to save as leftovers.  I was impressed with the food here. I really didn't know what to expect at a Chinese-fusion restaurant on the strip, but it was delicious and I expect to go there again next time I'm in town.",

Their service and pricing and Staff make it so relaxing. They have the best servers (Rodrigo,Whitney (Sp?), Cory, and Beatriz) are the best We've ever found. No were where have we been treated so well. We are not big eaters and only get one dish, which at some (Not all) Asian restaurants on the Strip would give us a bit of an attitude for ordering so little. Not so at Chin and Chin, they were all so welcome to us which is why we will come back and vote Chin and Chin as our only restaurant.",

It's a decent little place although i'd say the prices are definitely inflated especially when it comes to the appetizers (everything is about $20)  but it is the strip.   Ordered two apps, the salmon tartare (our waitress RAVED about it being the most delicious thing there) and the szehuan dumplings. The tartare came in a molded tower and the szehuan dumplings looked stuffed to the brim. While we loved the flavor of the dumplings the tartare on the other hand needs a lot of work. It literally tasted like a salmon dessert. There was scallions and avocado in the tartare but all we could taste was sugar. Never in my life did I think I'd eat a sweet tartare. Remember in the movie Elf where Will Ferrel pours syrup on the spaghetti? That's literally my experience with this tartare. Never again.   For our entrees, we ordered the peanut noodles (again raved by our waitress so now I was freaking out), the yang chow fried rice, and the kung pao three treasures. I thought the peanut noodles had a nice flavor and I appreciated the heat but nothing to write home about. I tried a one of the shrimps in the fried rice. It was BLAND, no flavor at all. The color of the rice was also very light. It needed some soy sauce. Lastly the kung pao had lots of flavor although there wasn't really any POW from the kung pao which i thought was a little weird.   If there's anything that I actually did like was our waitress. Reading the reviews here after eating here a lot of people complained about the service here but our waitress was sweet and very attentive. Besides the one bad recommendation, I would go again if she was our waitress (i'd steer clear away from the tartare though).",

Arriving around 11:15AM, the bartender let us know there was a buffet that was transitioning from breakfast to lunch and we could get sushi and a bunch of other favorites as they removed the breakfast items.   We thank Mauricio, the bartender, for letting us know about the buffet as we had no idea that Chin Chin had anything other than the regular menu.  He was very attentive and friendly and added to a very nice lunch. The food was very good.  I was happy to see summer rolls on the buffet along with spring rolls.  I also ate very tasty orange chicken, beef with broccoli and lo mein noodles.  They had quite a few very appetizing desserts too.  The buffet included a non-alcoholic beverage.   We Love NYNY.  Kudos again to an outstanding employee - Mauricio!!",

Just like every restaurant on the strip, it's priced high but this was probably some of the best pork belly I had.    I always love gambling at NYNY since comped drinks are quick to come to you and Asian restaurants on this side of the strip can be difficult to find.  I decided to come here on for late lunch before I get started for a heavy night of drinking.  When I started ordering food of the menu and the waiter told me I ordered way too much food for 1 person and suggested the 3 for $26 meal. So I ordered the shumai, pork belly, and bbq ribs for the 3 dishes.  I also added the shezuan dumplings and mushroom with boychoy.  Shumai were very standard and overcooked. The ribs were big and fatty and has good chasu flavor to it.  The star of the meal was the pork belly.  The sauce looked dark and salty but it was not even that salty at all. The pork belly basically melted in my mouth and it was so tender and fatty.  The portion size was good and I couldn't believe that was a half order.  After I finished those dishes, I was still waiting on my other 2 dishes and the waiter could not believed I wanted more food.  The mushroom was very fresh tasting and has a good crunch to it. I thought the dumplings were just okay, cilantro on dumplings does not taste asian at all.  Overall, I would definitely go back for the tender fatty pork belly.",

Every item was just OK, nothing stood out other than few.  Pork belly inside bun was great, Sliced BBG pork was great too, tofu chow Mein was decent. Other than that, nothing is impressive. One Item which I will order again, \"if I go there again\" is  KUNG PAO THREE TREASURES, Yumm.   Location is very convenient, its right in NY/NY and close to the strip entrance.

Chin Chin is an asian fusion restaurant with pretty big serving sizes. They station pretty girls outside of their restaurant to lure the men in (no joke) and it seems to work pretty well lol.  The food itself its alright. We ordered the beef Chow fun and mongolian beef. Definitely not your traditional chinese versions of these dishes you would find in a hole in the wall, but not bad for a casino chinese restaurant.  I'd say if you have a hankering for chinese and don't want to venture far if you're staying in NY NY, then Chin Chin is a good choice. Otherwise, venture further out to get your chinese fix. The prices aren't exactly cheap either..",

The service was very good but they should have noticed with us ordering spices and dressings and sauces that we didn't enjoy the food since we left 2/3 of it behind refused take-home containers. $88 plus tip was a hard lesson to learn and I will not be back to the Las Vegas location definitely want to try the other locations just in case",

We enjoyed the hot and sour soup, chicken chow fun, generals chicken, and white rice. The kids meals were lo-mein  noodles, vegetarian style and orange chicken, the portions are generous. Our server was Austin, he did an awesome job on serving us and recommending what was good and the differences between similar plates. 5 stars alone for him! Also the manager came by our table to ask how our meal was and she was just as nice. Great staff! Will definitely come back and try other dishes.",

For that price I'd expect much better quality! Then you put the portion size into the picture.... I would not recommend this dish to anyone.

The food was not even decent, in fact I'd prefer Panda Express (and Panda sucks but at least it is priced as such). The entrees were goopy and overly sweet and sour when not appropriate. I ordered Kung Pao Chicken and thought, how could you screw this up! It was very tangy and sour as if they added far too much vinegar. The sauce was goopy and NOT tasty.   The worst part for me was the rice. It cost $3 extra if you want a side of white rice. It says it is steamed rice but it was more like yesterday's Uncle Ben's instant rice that was microwaved to reheat. All that, and I haven't even mentioned the price!  The price is expensive even for a casino when you consider the comparables. $18 entrees and $3 extra for rice? That's just NOT ok if the quality is complete garbage.  Overall, the only reason to go here is if you need to appreciate your local crappy Chinese place more, this place will make it look like a 5 star restaurant.",

The food was amazing and the service was incredible.  I was able to enjoy delicious sushi while my husband had some Chinese food.  The simple pleasure appetizer is a must as it gives a sampling of a little of everything.  The Volcano sushi roll was dynamite.  Pedro was our server and he was impeccable.  When we gave him accolades on outstanding service he was so very modest saying that he couldn't do it alone and that the cooks, bartenders, and even hostess do it all together.  After being in the service industry for many years, I was truly impressed!  Looking forward to our next trip back so we can visit this establishment again!!!!  I give this 4 stars instead of 5 ONLY because if you are looking for an upscale dinner and atmosphere this isn't the place (extremely upscale as this is pretty casual). Other than that, I would highly recommend this place.",

I took my Mom to Vegas for her 60th birthday(best son ever, I know)....maybe I can win son of the year this year!!   Everything we ordered was really, really good, from the pork pot stickers to the young chow rice and the spicy honey shrimp. That last plate is very spicy, so be ready!  Pedro P. was there often and running around the place like a waiter who cares about his tables! When a waitress or waiter hustle like that, it shows extraordinary service and that's exactly what we got from Mr. Pedro P.! He even surprised my Mom with a birthday treat of cheesecake, berries and chocolate syrup!! He even sang a note or two from the happy birthday song to my mom by himself! Not much of a singer, but one hell of a waiter!!!  There was also a nice young manger lady with great energy and great service as well....didn't catch her name, sorry.  So if you want great food and even better service, this is the place to get BOTH!! If you're lucky enough to get Pedro P., then you'll be in great hands. He truly was one of the best waiters/waitress I've had in a long time....and I eat out a lot!  Thanks Pedro P!!...good looking out homie!",

We got a bottle of sake and perused the menu for what we wanted. About 6 mins later a guy appears and said he would be our server because her shift had ended.   I ordered the Pad Tai and was pretty disappointed- the flavors were to citrusy which is not what I am used to, it's generally a more savory or spicy kind of dish. The dish also lacked shrimp. However, there was an abundance of chicken which I could have done without.  When I explained to my server that I was not happy he seemed very nonchalant about it then told me if I wanted more shrimp it would be extra. I did not add more shrimp since I felt a bit turned off by his attitude.    When he came back and saw me taking the chicken off my plate, moving things around on the dish to try to make it better he offered to take the chicken away. I ended up giving my chicken to my boyfriend. I barely finished my Pad Tai; it was too intense for my palate.   Normally, I hate writing a review like this, but this was one of those situations where my server could have changed things around by rectifying the situation. Plus a better attitude could have gone a long way.   Maybe this isn't the norm for these guys as far as food and service, my boyfriend enjoyed his dish, but I don't think we will return. At least  I enjoyed the sake!",

    "text": "It was a well welcomed find after being disappointed around the area for breakfast almost every morning.   For the price that SB's was charging for a large coffee and a bagel, you can go to Chin Chin and get a fantastic breakfast buffet.  If you make sure to grab a ticket, you can get one free bloody mary or mimosa when you get the buffet.     The breakfast selection did not disappoint.   Well, except for the fact that I wish I would have found it a few days earlier.    Fresh fruit, oatmeal, eggs, made to order omelet, baked goods galore, and then very nice helpings of sausage, bacon, and ham.    Bottomless coffee and juice... it was well worth it, after being treated to the normal craziness that Las Vegas had to offer by nickel and diming you everywhere you go.    I will be back next year!",

They have design-your-own omelettes like you'd expect, but you order through your server - so you don't have to wait around in a line.  The meat lover's omelette was particularly good, and not overly gigantic so you can still try other stuff from the well-varied buffet.  We got here early enough for the early-bird-special, so it was a great deal and barely any line to get in.  The service was super friendly and just the right amount of attention.  So really everything I was looking for in a Vegas breakfast buffet!",

I loathe that I ate at the horrendous breakfast buffet for 4 days straight.   I hate that it takes forever to get a check considering that everyone orders everything they can possibly order within 30 seconds of being seated. I've ordered coffee and your 16 dollar plates of dry eggs, fatty bbq pork and undercooked fried rice, what the hell else can you possibly charge me for? Just bring the check and get rid of the pretense that I'm somehow sitting down for a real meal in an actual restaurant.   Oh yeah, and about the breakfast buffet fried rice? I'm onto you. Fried rice is traditionally made with cold day old rice that's had a chance to let the starch set up so it doesn't turn to mush when fried. You're trying to get around this by undercooking fresh rice, but it doesn't work. It just comes out a little crunchy and unpleasant in the center. I couldn't tell if the lump in my throat was barely edible fried rice, or tears welling up because I was forced to eat here again after working until 2am the previous night.  After trying the other breakfast options I ended up getting this bacon fried rice for 4 days. That says all I need to say about the other breakfast options.   If, for whatever reason you end up here for breakfast just pile a bunch of scrambled eggs on your plate, cover liberally with ketchup and call it a meal. It's really the only sane way out.  Fortunately I expensed the eightygodddamnedollars I spent here or I'd be really pissed. Oh, and the fruit is sour.",

The waitress brought the wrong sushi roll to the table and the replacement took longer than we had waited for the first one.  The Wor Wonton Soup was just ok.  I've had instant noodles that I would choose over this item on the menu though.  We were told and and were ok with the fact that the pork buns would take 15 minutes to prepare.   When they arrived at the table, the bread was soggy on the outside and undercooked on the inside.

For a Friday night, I was amazed how empty this place was.  I agree with many of the posts here that Chin Chin has \"lost its way\" over the years. The menu is insanely large.  I had the crab cakes as an appetizer and had a sweet and sour chicken along with a large plate of fried rice.  My guest had a chopped chicken salad.  While the food was O.K., it just wasn't worth the final tab (including two cocktails) that was over $78.00.  For that kind of price there are simply better options while in Vegas.",

We were greeted immediately by the hostess and she was able to accommadate our special seating needs.  Our server, Pedro, was excellent.  He came right over to our table after we were seated to take our drink orders.   He saw to our every need from drinks to special requests like items on the buffet.  I especially liked the potato pancakes.  My friend, Karen, said the sausage gravy and biscuits are better than Cracker Barrel.   We will definately dine there again while we're in Vegas!!!

We weren't sure about this place as we always passed it when we were heading to our room and were continuously asked if we wanted to look at a menu - it always looked more on the empty side and it seemed as though they were looking for business. We were craving Sushi though so we decided to give it a try and it was actually very good!  We had the shrimp tempura roll, philly roll and singapore noodles which was more than enough food for the two of us. Everything was great except I found the singapore noodles a bit more spicy than I was expecting but my boyfriend really enjoyed them. Service was very good and quick!",

Not warm. COLD! The server was working multiple stations and could not provide adequate service. This was a Wednesday night with no crowd. Manager came by and after I expressed my disappointment she took $7.00 fried rice off the check and offered a free desert. Check came $106.00 but no desert. So exasperate we left and did not even wait for my daughters free ice cream. Only reason I gave one star is they can't go any lower. Lost my business for a lifetime. Not one aspect of our visit was enough to ever go back. If your in Vegas there are many other Chinese restaurants that have to be better in every aspect. Not only thumbs down but a whole hand, arm and entire body DOWN.",

Their spicy cilantro lo mein is ridic. It's a fusion of asian and peruvian - althought it doesn't advertise itself that way. But having grown up on peruvian food I recognize the ingredients they're borrowing.  They also have some over-sized beer bottles that will make people do a double take when they see you walking around the casino with it.  I'm a fan. And since I took my wife there this year, I think she's one now, too.",

Unfortunately the food a Chin Chin is below average for the price you pay.  I understand it's Vegas, but value of product against its price want the best. We had the won ton stars as an app, I had the spicy seafood noodles and the wife had Orange Chicken (which that is what she eats at every Chinese restaurant). The spicy seafood noodles was to contain shrimp, calamari, and scallops in the noodles.  There was not one shrimp in the noodles. For $18 probably better not skimp on the shrimp.  The orange chicken that my wife had was $17 plus $3 for white rice and she said it truly was average.  By the time the damage was done it was a sub par $65 meal.  I'd suggest saving a couple bucks and head to Panda Express. Atmosphere was great though and service was great. Food was not the star of the show.",

We walked by Chin Chin a few times and circled back and walked into a little slice of heaven.   The hostess warmly greeted us and sat us quickly. Our waitress came right over and I promptly ordered a Bloody Mary. It was really good. I perked right up.   The menu was extensive on the Chinese fusion food side, smaller on the sushi side.  But there, in the middle of the specials section were the words I was looking for - Spicy Ahi Tuna tartare on won tons topped with avocado! Yes!   I immediately took a picture of my plate when it arrived, it was gorgeous and contained a huge portion of tuna. So much so that I had to save one piece for later. The tuna melted in my mouth and was the right amount of spicy paired with the crunch of the wonton, it totally won me over.  Now I'm sad I have to wait to return to Vegas for more. The side of cucumber salad was super good too, the vinegar dressing was perfect.   The waitress was great, the decor nice, the space was quiet for a Sat afternoon and the price totally worth every inexpensive penny. Found the needle in the Vegas haystack!",

I mean hello have you guys ever heard of GINGER or GARLIC?!?!?  I went again with my parents this past Feb and my mom was craving rice ( go figure :p) and I took em there.     * EGGPLANT Hot and spicy blend of Japanese eggplant, purple onions, scallions and garlic.  - The eggplant was pretty good, it had much flavor and I think they actually put garlic in this one..  .. TEMPURA SHRIMP / shrimp tempura / avocado / cucumber / burdock / radish /  =  The sushi roll was delish.  In Canada, this is called Dynamite Roll but is the US Dynamite is always something different in every place I have been to.  Rice was nice and fresh, shrimp was a decent size piece and veggies were fresh. Nice sauce on it as well.   SHRIMP WITH SWEET AND SOUR SAUCE - Plump deep fried shrimp, red bell peppers, onions and pineapple chunks with sweet and sour sauce. This was normal and typical.. the sauce was bleh... just sour lol",

So I pulled up to the Chin Chin bar right after the trade show I was working for a quick dinner before going upstairs to my room to crash.   The bartender was wicked friendly, and made me the most delicious ginger martini ever (I needed one!). There was another guy at the bar who had just received his meal, and it looked AMAZING. I just gestured over to his order and said I'd get exactly that!  Brown rice, tangerine beef, and steamed mixed veggies... YUM! I was only able to finish off maybe 1/4 of the rice and maybe only 1/2 of the beef, and it's too bad there's no fridge/microwave combo in the rooms or I would've totally gotten leftovers, but it was so worth it! And oh yeah... I had that for dinner at least 2 more times during my week there!  Not the best Chinese food I've had (the food came out waaaaaaaaaay too quickly to be made fresh - the \"crispy\" beef was soggy!), but still really good for a quick dinner. And the bartenders have always been really friendly!  And the breakfast buffet isn't bad - fried rice and bbqed pork for breakfast, yes please!",

I'm not a big sushi person so i can't say how they compare to most but as far as buffet goes I thought they were good. Lots of dessert options like cookies and pastries but they were all a little on the dry side. Chocolate covered strawberries were awesome and they had other fresh fruit. Service was great.",

Several varieties of eggs Benedict all perfectly cooked, an assortment of breakfast meats, fruit, fresh scrambles, waffles, pancakes, French toast, fruit and yogurt, chocolate covered strawberries, fresh fruit, cereal, granolas and breakfast fried rice. We were concerned it would be Asian since we were in the mood for traditional but it was American standard. They will also make eggs and omelette to order. We wished we had decided to try it earlier in the trip. They also offer you beverages to go with your bill when you're done. Very happy. Easily got our money's worth.",

Got the chance to meet both managers this past Saturday, Linda and Lisa. They were super friendly and professional.   I have not had a dish I did not enjoy and my husband I come here every time we are in Vegas. I, personally, think the buffet for breakfast is not good, just not the kinds of choices I like. They do a bang up business though. For me, I want Chinese food when I go to a Chinese place. :)  Now, here's the big advice. Try out their Asian pear martini from Dana the bartender. We became fast friends this past weekend, they are so delicious, light and crisp. A little to easy to drink ;).  I had the entire casino trying them by the end of the weekend! You will LOVE Dana, she is so sweet and fun to chat with!",

The waitress then blankly stared at me when I told her, \"I want Sushi.\" And she asked me if I wanted to see the menu. DUH! I don't have your menu memorized.  She definitely stopped for dramatic pauses.  She is a diva. I was complaining to my husband about what happened when a white male probably a buck 40 came up and passively asked if everything was ok only to try to de-escalate the situation and not to actually help.  The situation didn't need de-escalating. I'm just a minority woman who was not happy with the rushed horrible service.  The situation did not need tending to. What kind of trash establishment is this??? Won't be back. I have a biannual conference in Vegas and many people love going to Chin Chin.

Bacon, sausage, pancakes, cereal, etc. They also had more specialty breakfast items like red velvet pancakes. I will say one thing not good was that the eggs with steak inside of them... Didn't have any steak. The best thing was the omelette. Tell your server what you want, and they will do it. You can even get shrimp in it! Try it, it's very good and the omelette was cooked perfect.   The price for the buffet was outstanding for Vegas. You can that along with a drink like orange juice for under $20. I was shocked when my bill came to see that. Can't go wrong with the place.",

An employee of the hotel recommended Chin Chin. They had a buffet special for mother's day however there was also an option to order from their $10 menu. I ordered the build your own omelet breakfast with up to five toppings. Honestly, for $10 that is really affordable considering it's Vegas.   The meal came with toast and potatoes, and you can either have six egg whites or three eggs. I did get the five toppings and was hopeful that this omelet would taste great because in my opinion it's hard to mess up an omelet. Unfortunately I didn't find the omelet as appetizing as I hoped for because the entire meal tasted bland to me. I never add salt to my food, but in this instance I had to for flavor. Even with a little salt it was still bland.  The roasted potatoes were great, and you can't go wrong with sourdough bread toast and jam.   If I visit Chin Chin again, I'll try something else from the $10 menu.",

They let you have an omelette and I got the garden omelette trying to be healthy and it was a bit to healthy for me but not bad tasting. The highlights of the buffet were the ham, the french toast, and the breakfast potatoes. Everything else was pretty standard and others were pretty bad. The red velvet pancakes were more like cakes and was kinda chewy and very flavorful. The service was great. They were quite attentive. The was no wait and it was maybe half full at around 10am. It is a pretty decent breakfast buffet to start your day!",

To top off that experience, I was fortunate to be served by Karen both days and she's an absolute delight. She was very attentive and sweet. I was super tired in the morning but interacting with her was like a breath of fresh air. Thank you for making it such a pleasant experience!",

We hadn't had any Asian cuisine as of yet and I figured it would be worth it to try. There was a sign that said ask how to get free dim sum. We did: eat at the bar and get an entree/roll. So, we sat down and there's a few gentlemen at the bar. Ian greets us, doesn't take our order and continues \"training\" some dude with REALLY greasy hair... Charles asks if we've been helped, Ian chimes in that he's got us. Charles continues the task at hand. Later, he sees we still have menus. He asks if we've gotten our order taken. We tell him Ian said that and bounced! So, he takes our order, I selected the YumYum Scallop roll- FREAKING AMAZING! Fresh ginger, it was all I had hoped for after day drinking. LoL! My husband ordered Monkey  Brains! Hahaha... a ball of raw tuna topped with fresh avocado. Beautiful presentation. All I have to say is that Charles needs more recognition. Maybe a raise. He's a hard ass worker, and he kept things moving when it seemed to me that Ian was just traveling in circles! Annoying... then he tried to come tell Charles what to do! WTF? He's clearly got a handle on what's going on. I don't know what Ian's purpose is.",

We came at 12pm for lunch when most ppl seemed to be having their breakfast buffet which was very continental. We decided to order off their lunch menu. The veggie dumplings we got were served cold which we had to ask them to reheat and it was still bad - definitely skip this item. For the main course we got a spicy lo mein, spicy eggplant, and kung pao chicken. We asked them to make these dishes spicy and it turned out to be really good.   The cocktails they have seem pretty good and we enjoyed the kai saketini and dragonfruit mojito that we got. The waiters and the hostess are extremely friendly and nice!",

    "text": "I truly feel bad writing all these bad reviews in Las Vegas, having only lived here for a month and a half, and I don't mean to be comparing my experiencing with restaurants from back home, but hey, Yelp is all about honesty. And as I start exploring Vegas, my new home more and more, I will discover new gems, and I promise I will find great new places to write great reviews about. Until then, there's Chin Chin.  I love walking the strip, as I have many medical problems, and it's like physical therapy for me, but I hate paying \"strip prices\". My husband had already just had pizza, but having an allergy, we had to find a bite for me, and it being late, we had little choices. We walked up to Chin Chin, and the hostess with the mostest greeted us and struck up conversation. I explained that we moved here, and being that we were now locals, were were not looking to spend a whole lot, and were looking to avoid the tourist pricing. Well, she did some voodoo on us, and we found ourselves sitting down. Seeing that the restaurant was pretty established, having locations in Beverly Hills, Studio City, Bentwood, and West Hollywood, CA, I felt pretty comfortable with that. I looked over the menu, and couldn't find anything that was in the price-range of someone taking a stroll and wanting a bite- maybe she didn't get the point of the 5 minute conversation we had before she seated up. I went ahead and ordered the Spicy Seafood Noodles, and truly hoped for the best. While I waited, the party next to me seemed to be enjoying their food, but they were pretty pissed drunk, and ordered what I wanted to order, but went against my better judgement,and went with the servers recommendation.  When the food arrived, I was shocked the my $18 meal was just splashed into it's bowl, as there were 4 pieces of veggies stuck to the upper part to the rim. I'm not picky...okay, yes I am. How hard is it to take pride in what you put out of your kitchen, because it looked like crap. Now onto the food. It was okay. It reminded me of the Chinese/Korean dish, you find in many authentic Chinese restaurants (I reviewed one restaurant that served it that made their own noodles and charged $7 less called Chef Ping) called Jjampong. Yes, they were not the same dishes. The dish I ordered was a spicy black bean sauce, while jjampong is a fragrant red sauce, but they are very similar in other ingredients. The dish by Chin Chin was one note, and salty, and by the end of the dish, I was craving something more, and a glass of water. I was left very unsatisfied, and while there were an ample enough seafood in the dish, there was not enough calamari, maybe 2 pieces, and they didn't seem very fresh. All and all, I will not recommend, and will NOT spend my $18 on a dish that I could potentially get for half the price in Chinatown for half the price with twice the flavor. I thought I would get something of decent quality from a place that is established off the strip. Plus like I said, it was late, and I didn't have many choices. One, and one last thing. I know it was late, but the place was not closed, but was coming close to closing time, but it was not excuse for the lacking service we received, that just added to the disappointment.",

Service was a little slow. Warning: 2 rolls of eel is $10. I was expecting more rolls but it's Vegas! Overall very nice place.

The Chinese chicken salad was ok, but the chicken itself tasted pungent. White meat chicken breast should have almost no flavor and should take on the flavor of the sauce. Not in this case. The taste was just way off. My friend had the cashew chicken which was good, but lacked flavor. Had to add soy sauce to dish to eat. Really good food should never need a condiment. What brought this review to 2 stars were the delicious egg rolls. They were awesome. But unfortunately the bad tasting chicken left a horrible taste in my mouth. Would probably not go back.  Not just for egg rolls.  Not worth the time and effort it takes to get to New York New York hotel.",

    "text": "Let's be honest - nothing in Sin City is cheap. For Vegas travelers on a budget, finding an inexpensive place to eat can be tough.   During a trip to Las Vegas for the 2008 CES, my parents and I had dinner at Chin Chin at the New York-New York Hotel & Casino one night. The three of us agreed on this place as we had been looking for some Chinese food for some time. The prices were generally lower than those of other eateries in the area, so it seemed like an attractive place to eat.   Unfortunately, the low prices were just about the only good thing about the restaurant. For starters, many of the dishes were over-seasoned. Case in point, the fried rice was extremely salty as it was literally drenched in soy sauce. The other items we ordered also had similar problems, and it was rather hard for us to eat the food as we prefer lighter tastes.  The three of us also ordered some raspberry mousse cake for dessert. This, too, turned out to be a mistake as the cake seemed to be extremely heavy in fat and sugar. It was actually so greasy that it caused me to lose my appetite the following morning. I had split the slice with my parents, but even that didn't seem to help.  The quality of service was not impressive either. It took the waitress five minutes to bring us the dessert menu, even though there were few other guests. After we ordered the cake, it took another five minutes for her to bring it to us despite it being a pre-made item.  On the whole, I would not recommend this place. I understand one can't really judge a restaurant with a single dining experience, but my impressions are telling me to stay away from Chin Chin in the future.  -- TL;DR version --  Highs: Prices are relatively low Lows: Slow service; food is over-seasoned and greasy Bottom line: You get what you pay for in Vegas. Low prices aside, there are better options. Final verdict: 2.5 stars (rounded up to three)",

The general tsos chicken and sweet and sour shrimp plus the crab Rangoon were absolutely the best I ever had and I'm 46!  The manager , Linda, was very very attentive and personable. She gave us a coupon for a free mimosa with buffet. We came back the next day and  Linda was there and greeted us ! Our server Anita was an excellent server with a high emotional intelligence and kept our table clean and glasses full. The buffet was fresh, expansive and reasonably priced. Linda gave us a coupon for a free app on our next visit which will be tomorrow !",

    "text": "Maybe it was a bad night. Maybe it's because as New Yorkers, we eat some of the best Chinese food in the U.S.   First the positives. The manager on duty was very nice, empathetic and quite good at his job. Our server was also very thoughtful, professional and empathetic. The place is bustling, exciting and abuzz with activity. And by the looks of things, it's very popular.  For my family and me, we found the food was WAY TOO SALTY. That killed it for us. My wife ordered pot stickers that arrived hot - as they should, but were served with some sort of apricot dipping sauce served very very cold. That was a head scratcher. Back home, pot stickers are served with a soy-based sauce with ginger and green onions at room temperature.  I had vegetables in a curry sauce and my son had pork lo mein, all of which would have been delicious were it not for the high sodium content.   The manager on duty took our concerns very seriously and took appropriate action.   I do hope they take a look at their recipes and consider using considerably less salt. I'm sure they've got some talented folks working in the kitchen. Eliminating much of the salt used in the recipes and allowing the natural flavors of the ingredients to come through would be a great service to the skills their kitchen staff bring to the job. I'm sure Chin Chin's patrons would appreciate it too.",

Everyone is amazing from the wonderful bartender who took our \"to go\" order (didn't get his name) day before yesterday to our server last night Angel S., and Ian at breakfast this morning!! That's place runs like a well oiled machine. Everyone helps everyone else. We went there three times in the last three days. To us it looked like they truly care about their employees and their clientele.   First day: Hawaiian roll was amazing (ordered with pineapple on the side). Pan fried pot stickers: yummy!!!  Second day: husband has the Pokie Roll and I had the Hawaiian (butt of course I stole a couple of pieces from the hubby).  Third day: We had the 2 for 1 breakfast... Holy !! This is the way buffets should be run. All fresh and you could get made to order eggs, omelets, and a couple of other items. All included!! I went for it. Omelette with asparagus, spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms, caramelized onions, goat cheese, and lump crab meat. Yes real crab meat!! Husband had an omelette too but his was kinda boring. All his had was steak, hollandaise sauce, mushrooms, and cheddar cheese.  If we ever come back to Vegas (after recouping that is), this will be the first place we hit. Highly recommend!",

We got orange chicken, spring rolls, vegetable rice, noodles, beef with broccoli, shrimps and maybe something else ( I don't remember:)) Everything was pretty good but I think beef was over-salted.   I loved their desserts! Fruit tart was the best dessert I had in a looong time. That custard was just magical! I enjoyed cheesecake as well. Chocolate covered strawberries are basically always the same for me.   And now the best part: we paid only for one lunch buffet from two with Yelp coupon. We spent 21 on buffet plus taxes and a good tip = 38$. Not bad for Vegas, right?;)  I'm definitely planning to come back here on my next Vegas trip. The only thing that I didn't like was out waitress. She was good but as soon as she heard about our coupon she changed her attitude. No, she wasn't rude but just less attentive and kinda cold. My husband gave her a good tip so she would feel better about us having a coupon (lol). I'd do the opposite thing! Anyway, don't judge book by it's cover. Btw manager was very nice when she came to confirm our coupon  Definitely, would give 5 stars to this place but service should be improved.",

We didn't get asked about the custom omelettes until after we ate the food from a trip through the buffet. About the time we were asked if we wanted drinks (like water & coffee). If that's typical of the bar service here, I'd recommend getting a table.  If it hadn't been for the lackluster service, it would be a 4.  A few items on the buffet seemed like they were under heaters there for too long (stuffed French toast & crab cake Benedict). The biscuit & gravy was good. Eggs were good (scrambled). Rosemary potatoes were yummy.",

Prices for sushi rolls start at $15-18. And that's for the same portion as you would get anywhere in the US, the flavor not any better if not a little worse than others I have had. Service was okay, we sat at the bar and could've sworn 2-3 different servers stared right at us as they were grabbing drinks and food and said nothing to us. We sat for a while to order drinks and then another while to order food. Then waited another while for the check.... luckily we weren't in any hurry.  Breakfast buffet was honestly disgusting. No idea how this place even gets more than 2 stars. Not a good representation of Japanese food, and not even a good take on Japanese American if that was their goal.  Overall, overpriced for not good food. Would avoid avoid! Happy eating!",

    "text": "My review is based on the complications during and after the meal. The food was definitely delicious, however, the miscommunication from management, and the food preparation deserved a one star. The server was polite, considerate, and diligent. I'm not giving a one star because she was great! Some of the complications regarding the food are bad seafood and undercooked blobs of noodles.   The birthday girl ordered a seafood chow mein which was bad and got it replaced for chicken. My issue is that the chicken chow mein was ringed up like a seafood chow mein (the seafood cost more than the chicken). Aside from that, my lo mein was cooked in blobs or chunks and had an odd taste. I got it replaced and it was delicious but there was still chucks of noodles (not as many and as big as the first one). We did not receive any compensation or discounts for the misunderstanding and bad seafood on their behalf.   One major factor that played a huge part in this review is that I told the server about a member of my party's birthday and received a nice cheesecake but not singing. Might not sound like a big deal but there was another birthday and I heard some servers singing happy birthday to them.   We were planning to come to the breakfast buffet but we have reconsidered and decided to join the buffet at Luxor instead.",

Nice mix of seaweed and tofu. Flavorful.   California roll was well a California roll. You can't really mess this one up. It was tasty.   Wor won ton was a mixed bag of emotions.  Good - huge scallops. Tasty broth. Med size shrimp.  Average - pork won ton. Not great not bad.   Weird - noodles. Was the weirdest tasting noodles I've ever had in won ton soup. Tasted like instant noodles on the stale side. It felt like a new cook made this and added the wrong noodles. This really ruined the dish for me. I tried to eat it all but couldn't finish the noodles.   Next time I'd probably try regular won ton. This place is a bit more expensive. I'd rather go off the strip and save the money.",

    "text": "Chin Chin is suppose to be this authentic Chinese food restaurant located inside the New York, New York Hotel & Casino. My family was visiting and also staying in the hotel and one night decided to eat here. One thing you should know about this place is...Be prepared to leave here with some to-go boxes because they truly serve you family sized portions on pretty much all of the items on the menu. Our order consisted of:   Spicy Seafood Noodles- Soft lo mein noodles with shrimp, calamari, scallops, scallions, snow peas and red onions, tossed in a black bean sauce.  Beef and Broccoli- Flank steak, broccoli and black mushrooms sauteed in a garlic brown sauce.  Anthony's Special Noodles- Lo mein noodles, sliced chicken breast and shredded carrots tossed in a spicy cilantro sauce.  Salmon On The Beach- Shrimp Tempura, cream cheese, avocado topped with salmon, yum yum sauce, unagi sauce, and scallion.  While the food was decent here I do question the thought of it being \"authentic\" Chinese food as I can compare this meal to prior Chinese restaurants I've dined at. Like any other restaurant inside of the hotel and casino's the price tag will be up there because of the location and convenience. This place gives portions that make the prices worth it though. The 3.5 stars would be a bit more accurate for this dining experience and that's because the service was spotty and my dad actually found a few pieces of hair in his food.",

The fried rice, wholly sweet mother, did I mention Panda Express is across the street. Man, probably the worst tasting and looking fried rice I can recall, I quickly had them take that back.  There was also Pad Thai....which I don't remember if Pad Thai is always supposed taste like sweet and sour sauce....don't forget about Panda Express.  I'm not sure what was the best part, the boiled edamame or the that our waitress left without telling us or a backup waitress to tend to our table on top of not putting our replacement order in for the fried rice....which probably was in our best interest.   The manager well...he at least took the fried rice off the bill and offered a free dessert....but honestly, by this point the damage was already done and nothing food related was going to save this visit.",

The crab wontons were also tasteless and served with a sauce that I really could not identify but was not a good match.  I requested sriracha and was told they didn't have any. Mind you, these apps are $15 each.    For my entree, I ordered spicy garlic tomato beef which was neither garlicky nor spicy.  The tomatoes were not even close to ripe and contained large cores and the meat was rubbery.  Also, get this:  The entrees at this Chinese restaurant DO NO INCLUDE RICE even though they are $20.  Plain steamed rice can be added for $3 or fried rice for $8.    The other entree was chow mein and was just ordinary.   I've  had better Chinese food at the mall.  Our bill was $70.  TOTAL RIPOFF",

As a Asian person I usually don't like to go out to eat overpriced Asian food especially a Chinese buffet. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The food was good. Certain items tasted better than others but the presentation was very nice. The dessert table is beautiful. Specific items that stuck out to me would be the chow mein, the barbecued pork and the sushi was pretty good as well. I had an offer for checking into Yelp and for some reason it wasn't redeeming but the girl that stopped by my table and asked if we needed anything else said it wasn't a problem and took care of it for me. That was very nice of her to do. I would definitely return. Service was good and so was the food.",

    "text": "Between two Vegas trips, I've now been here three times. Wish I could give half stars, because I'd up this to four and a half if I could. The prices are very, very reasonable ($7 for pork buns, $6-10 for sushi rolls), and the food is top notch. The service is also great. I was nervous about making a 9:30 show across the street at MGM, sitting down to dinner with eight people a little after 8 p.m. We made it back across the street in plenty of time, and the waiter even courteously split our checks.   Word of warning: I'd stick to the sushi and the dumpling-type stuff. The traditional Chinese food here is just average. That's why it gets four and a half stars instead of five. The sushi and the dumplings, on the other hand, are really good.  The first time I went, I got the mongolian beef. Total meh. People who got other, typical Chinese food (lo mein, fried rice, etc.) had similar experiences.   Came back this year and wised up, ordering a spicy tuna roll, some hot and sour soup and the chin chin bao. All of it was top notch. Their spicy tuna, especially, is among the better sushi I've ever had. I tried a little bit of other people's varieties (shrimp tempura, some specialty rolls) and they were really good, too. The Chin Chin bao? Wow. Three puffy, steamed pork buns that pack a delicious barbecue flavor, served with a REALLY spicy wasabi mustard (good if you're in to that, my spicy food loving friends tell me) and a tasty chili sauce for dipping. The buns really fill you up in a good way -- definitely enough for a meal with just them and the sushi. Had some open-faced dumplings that were really good, too.   For ordering two sushi rolls, you get a sizeable jug of hot saki -- a nice touch. They also knew how to make a good Manhattan, though their bourbon selection was limited. I'll definitely be back if I come back to Vegas. Not only is the sushi a nice, light compliment to other heavy meals I'm likely to have, the prices are very low by Vegas strip standards.",

I ordered the Crab Wonton \"\"Appetizer\"\" and after a third time asking they showed up at our table after our entire party was done eating... that is Not Acceptable! The Manager was notified by our waiter after complaining about the soups and refusing the appetizer but Never came over to apologize or offer any resolution ... again Not Acceptable! The waiter took the one soup off and the appetizer while missing the wrong order deduction I had the manager come over. He began to argue with irritability that the correct amount was taken off.  in the end I left  hungry and wasted 1hr45min of my time",

Stopped here for brunch before heading out to the Grand Canyon. The brunch was actually pretty decent. They had eggs (regular, steak and eggs, pepper eggs), waffles, french toast, red velvet pancakes, bacon, sausage... A LOT to choose from! And the food was good! A bit disappointed that they only had syrup up at the buffet though. It would've been nice to have it on the table, but I'm not going to be THAT picky with my review.  I gave it a 3 star rating because although the food was good, it wasn't $17.95 per person good. The price was a bit hard to swallow (no pun intended... well maybe just a little...). Our waiter Cesar was EXTREMELY nice. He made sure we were filled on drinks and had everything we need. The service deserves 5 stars alone!! The other disappointment was that unfortunately Cesar works for a company that will automatically add gratuity of 18% to a check for a party of 7... Anytime a restaurant tells me what I need to pay in gratuity, that's all I'll pay. If I had calculated the tip on my own, he would've likely have gotten 20%+. Way to screw your hard-working and deserving employees.",

We ordered pot stickers...curry chicken RICE...and peanut noodles.  Yeah it's kind of a strange combination but so what...we were on vacation.  After about 15 minutes of placing our order we get out pot stickers and as we were finishing them our waitress comes back and asks us what else we ordered besides the peanut noodles.  Why didn't she ask sooner...why should she even have to ask at all...I could have sworn I saw her write it down.  So anyways, I told her chicken curry...and then she says oh yeah I remember...so I mistakenly thought she remembered that I said chicken curry RICE!  Another 15 minutes later our order comes out and guess what...we didn't get the chicken curry rice...it was just their chicken curry dish...but we decided not send it back because we didn't want to wait another 15 minutes.  My friend didn't like the pot stickers or the peanut noodles.  I personally thought everything was O.K.  If you order their noodles they are VERY generous on the portions...too generous actually.  Our waitress came back only once and then I had to flag her down for more refills.  It was just an O.K. experience.  If I were really craving Chinese food I would come back.",

    "text": "This restaurant is my favorite place on the strip to eat and my favorite thing about staying in the NYNY hotel. Not only can I eat my meal in the bar, close to the casino, but the yakisoba noodle dish I order - each and every time I stay here - is bombdiggity.  I know it's weird to like a restaurant this much, over just one dish...however; when you find something you really, really like, you must stick with it. That means, I will walk over from the MGM or the Excalibur (God forbid I have to ever stay there again) or catch the tram from the Luxor or Mandalay Bay to have my favorite bowl of yakisoba. After all, buffets are only fun the 1st day or 2. Then, it's just too much and too expensive (the average about $25 now and higher on Sunday mornings).  The restaurant itself is clean and lovely, especially for a Chinese restaurant. No offense, but Chinese restaurants are usually adorned with dated Chinese decor. This place is modern, light and sparse. Not dark and spooky (at least, that's what the Chinese restaurants in Portland are like).  I don't have plans to visit Vegas in the near future, but can say for certain that I will eat here when I return.",

This time i met a friend at New York New York and we decided to got to the Chinese restaurant. The server informed us that the portions are large and it's recommended to eat family style. We were plesent surprised that the portions were indeed large.  This is odd since most places on the strip over charge for food. I had the Mongolian Beef which was perfectly glazed with green onions nestled atop a bed of crispy white noodles. We also ordered the sweet and sour shrimp which actually came with too much shrimp.  I asked the server for some pepper oil, which arrived a warm in a gravy boat with large red peppers. The food quality was top notch, fulok flavor and plenty to go around. From beginning to end the experience was incredible. I will surely visit in the future.",

Because the dim sum sticks to the metal ones, causing all the fillings to come out of the unwrapped dumpling!  I ordered the wonton soup... The soup was so bland that I may have been drinking hot water and I wouldn't have known the difference.   Our table shared some other \"traditional\" Chinese dishes and they all sucked. To top everything off, the service was one of the worst. He never refilled our water, never came by to check on us so we couldn't let him know how awful the food was and he took forever to bring out the check.   The reason we chose this place?

I realize that working with soft tofu is difficult, but that shouldn't mean that you add it in last, leave it to cook for a minute and serve it when it's still cold. - lemon chicken. Fiance got this. Apparently it was typical fried lemon chicken. Can't really go wrong.   They also charge you for rice. $1.50 for steamed rice, $5.50 for a small fried rice and $7.50 for a large fried rice.

Though we were in a dilemma we wanted to have our meal there, and thus went. Not being sure of the taste there we wanted to be on a safer side instead of experimenting. So we ordered a chicken fried rice. Trust me when I say this that this was the best chicken fried rice I have ever tasted in my entire life. Best flavour with best ambience and best hospitality staff. Its been almost 3 months that I had this meal and I still cherish it. Amazing food! I admit that I dint try other dishes but am sure that the restaurant has good flavours in the air. A must visit when you go to vegas! And yes the price was very reasonable.

Would not recommend to anyone, plenty of other good options at New York New York Hotel.",

The king pao three treasures dish included shrimp, chicken and beef in a mandarin sauce, both spicy and mildly sweet. Our excellent waiter was Randall and he provided friendly customer service.",

    "text": "3.0 Stars  I was walking through New York New York and noticed they had a Chinese eatery option. I'm in Vegas for a conference so I figured I'd gives this place a try to get some variety from the typical conference food.  To layout my expectations, I grew up in San Francisco where I was actually spoiled with Chinese food that was big portioned, cheap, and tasty.  I decided to order the Singapore Noodles for $12.95.  I noticed this noodle dish didn't have the Hot & Spicy symbol so I decided to ask them to make it a little more spicy for me.  My dish consisted of:  *Shrimp *BBQ Pork *Bean Sprouts *Onions *Bell Peppers *Rice Noodles *Curry Sauce  When the plate came out I noticed it was HUGE. I saw one giant mound of noodles and I was ready to tackle it!    The noodles themselves were done nicely where they still had a little springiness.  It was stir fried in a curry sauce, but I wasn't able to taste much of the curry flavor.  Even though I asked them to make it spicy they actually just added some roasted chili peppers into my dish. My server was nice enough though to bring me some extra chili sauce.   I poked around my noodles and noticed they were really sparing with the ingredients. I found myself actually eating a lot of noodles before I got to any of the shrimp or BBQ pork.  Chin Chin does a decent job of providing traditional Chinese food in a casual cafe setting. My server was overall really nice and attentive.  The price was reasonable for Las Vegas, but in terms of flavor and taste it still made me long for some cooking back at home.",

    "text": "After looking up all the other, more unique, Chinese food restaurant reviews in Vegas, we decided to go to Chin Chin.  I didn't feel like paying 3 times as much for food that got worse reviews than this chain.  I'd been to the one here in Southern California and knew we'd have a good meal.  And we did!  The reservation we made was necessary on a Saturday night, but I think we called an hour before hand.  We both got drinks off their signature list.  They were strong, like we like em'.  I got the orange soda one and loved it!  They also have a full bar, naturally, Vegas...as well as a pretty good Sake list.    The hot and sour soup was a perfect starter.  I hadn't had it since my favorite, family owned, place down the street from me closed, probably because of their C rating, but that didn't stop me...they had a B when I started going there.  Anywho...it was good if not better than the homemade stuff they made.  Our dishes came out fast, which normally isn't a problem, but we were trying to kill time.  Again, it's a Chinese food place, food usually doesn't take that long to cook.  Both our dishes were delicious.  I got the 3 meat kung pao.  It wasn't as spicy as I normally like it but the chicken, beef, and shrimp mix was excellent.    My girlfriend got the orange chicken and I was kind of upset I didn't either. I'm a sucker for it, and they did an excellent job.  Perfect amount of crispy, it's breaded, but not soggy.  Gah! I hate soggy Chinese food.  The peppers were fresh and tasty as well.  Vegas has many options for food, almost too many, but if your craving consistent quality Chinese at a good price, you can't beat Chin Chin.  They also have a good selection of Japanese dishes along with Sushi and Noodles.  So you've got options.",

It wasn't and we were seated right away.  The buffet is a blend of American breakfast items and a few Chinese items.  I was disappointed there weren't more Chinese items on the buffet but it was still pretty darned good.  American:  Fruit, waffles, scrambled eggs, bacon (good), link sausage (good, large, delicious).  Chinese:  Egg rolls, Fried rice, and BBQ Pork that was REALLY good.  Service was fairly good.  Food was hot.  A tad spendy but not bad for Vegas.  Not a destination but good if you're nearby.",

The Monte Carlo breakfast buffet was OK but we found Chin Chin when we decided to try a different place, and Boy, are we glad we did!  The food was fantastic and the servers were top rate and super friendly.   You can get a custom made huge omelet with just about anything you can think of inside if you want.  My favorite was the Meat Lovers omelet with juicy tender steak, bacon, sausage and ham inside.  I also asked them to put cheddar cheese inside and it was fantastic! They have everything else including regular french toast, french toast stuffed with cream cheese, pancakes, real sliced ham roast, great crispy has browns and tons of sweet breakfast type deserts.  We loved it so much we ate breakfast there for three mornings straight!  For about $22 a person you can't beat it.  Much better than a hotel buffet where the food has been sitting for so long, they made everything new as the food got low, so everything was super fresh!  We will be back there the next time we are in Vegas for sure!",

    "text": "I've been to Chin Chin on Sunset in LaLa lots of times.  Fun place to enjoy tasty dim sum and a great Asian salad.  Unfortunately, the Las Vegas version is not up to the same standards.    Judging just the food - I ordered a steamed fish entree.  They insist the fish was fresh - not frozen but I don't believe them.  The fish appeared cooked on top but the undersides were grey and cold.  I can't imagine any way this could happen unless the fish was frozen.  I returned it and they removed the charge from my bill, but I lost my appetite after that.  Our one order of dim sum was the shui mai.  They were huge - cooked to order so we had to wait - but it was worth it. The lettuce wrapped chicken was typical of nearly every Chinese restaurant I've been in.  Nothing special.  Service was a bit unprofessional. I think they could cut out the socializing between the wait staff and concentrate on providing better service and a better product. Our tab was in the $135 range including tip - before the credit for the frozen fish - for two, so I think it's fair to compare Chin Chin's service to other restaurants in this price range. If you like being called \"you guys\" by the wait staff - this is your kind of place.  I left with a bad taste in my mouth - literally - and all other ways.",

We were greeted by a wonderful Waiter names Dexter.  He was amazing and made us feel that we could ask questions!!  He started off with a football conversation then explained that he would help us order enough but not too much food with was awesome since we have never been here before and have no room for leftovers.  We ordered a \"safe\" plate of California Roll Sushi and it was a perfect suggestion!! Loved it. As far as our meal went I ordered sweet and sour chicken and my husband ordered Broccoli and Beef.  Both were amazing the chicken was flavored perfectly not too spicy and very moist.  The beef and Broccoli was excellent also with no fatty pieces of meat and the broccoli not soft.  Perfect experience please look up this restaurant and if Dexter is working request his table!!! Top 3 Server of all time!!!!",

Wow, Chin Chins has been a favorite of mine since the 80's since I started dining at The West Hollywood location. Whether you get the dim-sum combo that gives you get 3 mini choices or should order off the menu I guarantee disappointment is not an option, just tasty bliss. The Chinese chicken salad is a must for any meal. Now some major items worth sampling are BBQ pork, potstickers, Szechwan dumplings ( in a  cilantro sauce ) or Gift Wrapped chicken then kick off your meal. Phase 2 of your Chin Chin journey offers you The honey prawns , King Pao Chicken or Mongolian Beef are excellent choices, so try one  and maybe the green bean dish to balance your veggies out from all flesh you'll eat.  Frank give this place a 10 Star double thumbs up review but Yelp only offers 5 so that's what you get!",

They serve \"Americanized\" Chinese food which isn't a bad thing but when it comes with poor service, the experience just isn't that great.  We were lucky enough not to have to wait for a table.  It was a Friday night and the restaurant wasn't that busy so that should have been my first inclination that maybe we should have dined elsewhere.  The hostess was pretty friendly and welcoming.  However, our server was a different story.  She had an attitude and it was apparent that she hates her job.  She kind of rushed us while ordering and basically threw something on there that we really didn't ask for.  She took the liberty of ordering the sampler of appetizers for us.  Even though we knew what she did, we didn't decline as we were unsure of what appetizers to get anyway.    The food was good, not great, and like I said, it is definitely not authentic Chinese food.  Their fried rice was very similar to Panda Express (Chinese fast food chain), so really nothing special there.  The Mongolian Beef was pretty tasty but they overloaded it with green onions.  I'd say the Sweet and Sour Pork and the appetizer sampler were the winners of our meal.  What I thought was strange was that they have sushi on the menu.  I didn't care to give it a try because I don't go to Chinese restaurants for Japanese food.  They have some pretty good cocktails but be prepared to spend some money on them.  What do you expect; this is a restaurant in a hotel on the Strip.  Would I dine here again?  Probably not.",

I have a gluten allergy, and they have an entire section of their menu without gluten! They have a chicken dish, gluten free, that wasn't that great. The spring rolls had a lot of basil in them which overpowered the flavor. So at first, I was a little worried about what was to come.   However, their Mongolian beef made up for all of it! I swear it had crack in it. Perfectly cooked, not too sweet, not too many onions, just great. I could eat it any day! They also had gluten free crab and asparagus fried rice. Now, it comes without any real sauce, but they give you GF Soy sauce. Even without the sauce it was great! We couldn't stop eating it! Not greasy, totally hit the spot. They also had a noodle dish that was good too -  a little greasy, but slightly crispy noodles with a light sauce + beef. Yum.   I gave it 4 stars because the food was pretty good, but the service was great too. We brought my 18 month old when we went, and the server was super friendly and kept giving him chopsticks and made him laugh. Friendly, knowledgeable, and all around good experience. We will definitely come here again!  P.S. They are able to do some sushi rolls gluten free too. I got their salmon cut roll, and even though at first I thought it was too pricey, the roll is huge! Tons of salmon, not too much rice, totally worth the price. The salmon was delicious too - not slimy or fishy. Fresh and tasty!",

We were looking to grab a quick breakfast and when we arrived to chin chins we were just seated, I thought we were going to get o offered a menu but right away a very friendly waiter arrived to our table and  explained to us how the buffet worked.  So after asking the price which is 20$ per person I was kinda expecting something really delish and outta the norm. Ummm...no, the only really delish thing there we're two small cranberry cheesecake muffin bites which those probably come from a bakery. The eggs were either greasy or rubbery just like the hash brown patties, the granola was stale, the coffee was weak, the plates and utensils were still dirty with food stuck to them...the only good thing there was the ham and the service. This was not worth the price if you just want a quick meal, since it was my first time in vegas and had no idea where anything was, no one outta of the few staff workers I asked had told me there was a Dennys around the corner and other more economic choices than this place. *sigh oh well you live and learn right?",

Anyways, I ordered the tangerine beef (which does come with rice, I read a review that said it did'nt?) and my wife ordered chow mein with shrimp.  Both of our meals were very good, same quality as a P.F. Changs. Prices were very reasonable considering it is in a nice hotel, we paid $44 for our meal, that's with tax and tip. All in all, we will definately go here again if we are craving chinese on our next trip.

Waiter noted that most of the items were not touched and actually asked if we wanted it to go. Really? How about asking \"Did the food really suck?

This is something I wanted to have in my life, I was sure.  The next morning we found ourselves in the buffet line. The selection looked very interesting and delicious. Sezchuan-style eggs, Egg Foo Yung, five-spice toast, bbq pork, eggs, house potatoes, and more.  Oh mediocrity, how you tantalize with overwhelming promises and underwhelming deliveries. Everything was sub-par in my opinion. The Sezchuan eggs weren't that bad, actually,and the five-spice toast would've been better had I chosen to soak them in the ginger syrup instead of consuming dry.  I was so sure that I wanted this Asian breakfast buffet in my life, but after eating almost everything that was offered, I'm not so sure I want it again. Maybe we were there on an off day, but for now I'll probably shy away.",

Wife ordered the sweet and sour pork with a side of white rice, I ordered the chicken and rib combo with fried rice and vegetables. Food came out in about 20 min, and it was ok. Wife enjoyed her food, my chicken was dry, and the ribs were good, but not great. The fried rice was ok, would have been better if they gave you the option to add shrimp or chicken to it, but since it came with the meal that wasnt an option. The thing I don't like is 90% of the sides are a la carte so if you want chow mein or fried rice with your meal be prepared to pay $10-$15 more. Overall you can get better and that's sad for me to say as I'm a big NYNY fan. Our waitress ( who was the bartender helping out) was awesome!!!",

Well, unfortunately I wasn't wrong.  I went with the Chinese chicken salad because that's their \"famous\" dish.  It was OK but nothing special.  They were super stingy on the amount of chicken, and the ginger dressing was a bit strong.  The har gow (shrimp steamed dumplings) were horrible.  They were some of the worst I've had as they were really soggy, the dumpling skin was too thick, and the shrimp was unidentifiable and overcooked.  And to add insult to injury, I was super thirsty after my meal.  If they're going to use MSG so liberally, why doesn't the food taste better?  Never again!",

So good that we went twice in 2 days. 4 different kinds of eggs Benedict (which were all really good - crab cakes Benedict was the best), chocolate covered strawberries, omelets to order, berry crepes, plus all the normal breakfast foods along with creative versions of those foods (like normal scrambled eggs and scrambled eggs with fresh herbs and goat cheese). Both days our waiters (Pedro and a guy whose name I wish I could remember) were fantastic - both with positive energy and fun that made our dining great without being overly present. Price was just under $20, which seems really reasonable  (for vegas )",

That said, it didn't cost as much as your standard Vegas mega-buffet. Just $17 each.   It was a decent selection of breakfast staples -- waffles, pancakes, eggs, french toast, biscuits & gravy, sausage, bacon, and even not so typical things like egg rolls, pot stickers, and fried rice.  Service was quick and on top of things, even with the Memorial Day crowd. So if you're wanting a buffet, but looking for a smaller, less crowded breakfast buffet, head over to NY NY and check out Chin Chin.",

Mooshy rice cooked in a pool of oil which gives it a huge unappetizing shine, and it was flavorless, you actually had to add soy sauce.

Everything was reasonably priced, considering it's the LV Strip. The staff was all very professional and kind. We sat at the bar, the bartender was very welcoming and easy to talk to. He made a few suggestions for us. I forget the name of our appetizer he suggested, but it was a fried wonton. It was so good. Then we ordered a California roll topped with yellowtail and some different sauces, that was delicious. But our absolute favorite and most memorable was the \"monkey brain\". It's a tuna ball covered with avocado and a couple sauces, when you dip into it, it really looks kinda \"brainy\". It was without a doubt very memorable and extremely delicious. I had never had any sushi so whimsical and fun, not to mention yummy! I recommend that to everyone!! I can't wait for our next trip to Vegas and our next monkey brain from ChinChin!!",

The restaurant manager (I don't know his name) also stopped by to make sure everything was great. Overall a good experience! We ordered a dim sum and then sum deal which has half orders of dim sum, soup, meat, and rice dishes. You get to pick 3 among those. Believe me the portion size was really good. It was half order but fill us two up. We tried hot and sour soup, BBQ pork, yang chow fried rice and wonton soup. All were good and the price is great ($23 for 3 dishes). Overall this restaurant exceeded my expectation",

Our server, Beatriz, was extremely efficient and courteous. I couldn't figure out how she managed to keep our glasses constantly filled. The second night we returned she remembered us and our orders! Pretty amazing. They also gave us a gluten-free dessert on the house, a rich, dense flourless cake. I'd highly recommend Chin Chin.",

His response: \"yeah several other people have said that!\" really? lol! Then came cold lettuce wraps and when we told him we just got a \"sorry\" no offer to replace! I ordered the curry chicken and the potatoes were raw and no sauce very dry! Then the manager came over and kindly offered to redo my plate. He whisked all my food away while I watched my husband and son ate. They brought my steamed rice about 10 mins before the replacement meal and then it was cold by the time the chicken curry came back! Potatoes still raw but no one even asked! Don't you think all the chicken and sauce gone and potatoes on the plate was a great clue lol! No offer to comp or reduce price. The next day I called Andrea (the I don't give a s.... manager) who basically said give us another try to screw u out of $100 and guess what I did! 3 days later breakfast buffet a lady waitress Kanae at least no attitude but she pours a 1/2 cup of water and says \"I'll be back!\" no refill of water, coffee or OJ! OMG lady what would you do if you had to bring food too! Why is it overpriced restaurants in resorts get to bring crappy food and bad service for very high prices and they don't care and we keep going?????",

However, the bacon was flavorless and the homefries hunan chicken were pretty gross. They had a nice selection of pastry and all the drinks you want are included in the price. I would probably give it 2 stars if I had to pay any more than the price of 14.99 and compared to other buffets it was okay. I was surprised they didn't have dim sum or more of a selection.  While it was okay, I probably wouldn't go back.",

She seemed to understand. When she brought our sushi I thought the inside of the roll was cream cheese. I didn't think to ask. The first and only bite I took I realized it had mayo inside. We sat there for a long time waiting for the waitress to come back so I could ask her about the mayo. Her response was, \"well there's only a little mayo to bind the crab inside.\" Too bad I don't have a little allergy. The manager came over to apologize but didn't even offer to take care of the bill. I had to find a place that sold Benadryl to counter act the allergic reaction. I have been sick since then. If you need or want your food made a certain way don't go to Chin Chin. I am incredibly disappointed in the experience we had.",

She was attentive and friendly. We tried the singapore noodles which were pretty good. Of course I had better but it was pretty close. The portions were huge! We also ordered the curry chicken which was very tasty. The curry wasn't spicy, it was just the way I like it. We started with the foil wrapped chicken which had huge pieces of chicken but not too much flavor so it wasn't that  great.   Overall, it was pretty comforting here. Had a great meal and food wasn't even pricey. Great place for some decent chinese food at a great price in vegas.",

My friends and I were looking for somewhere to eat, and somewhere that didn't take forever to serve food because we were headed to MGM to watch a show, and we had about 2 hours to eat and head over to MGM.  We saw this place and we asked the hostess how long the food takes to be served.  She said that it was pretty quick, so we believed her and went in.  I thought that she was just trying to make us stay so she told us that it would be soon, but IT WAS FAST!  We sat down, read the menu really quickly and picked out stuff immediately.  The food was served just as quickly!  And it was good!  The portions were HUGE.   I mean coming to Vegas you expect to spend a bunch of money, but getting gypped because it's Vegas after all, but you definitely get a run for your buck at this place.  I ordered a beef chow fun or something, and it wasn't as greasy as most Chinese restaurants have it, which is good!  I was fairly impressed with the food, quality, service, and money-to-food ratio. :)    I'd definitely go back if I'm feeling some Chinese food in Vegas next time.",

California roll and spicy tuna, the crab in the California roll was fresh, taste was great. I'd have to say the California roll was better than the tuna.  We also ordered General Tso's chicken and a noodle bowl.  The General Tso's had a dark brown sauce with a unique taste. I'm not sure I can say I like that flavor compared to the other General Tso's I've had in the past. As for the noodle bowl, it was tasty, chicken, shrimp, and beef with veggies and thick noodles. I asked for mine a little spicy so it had a bite to it but nothing over the top.  The price was a bit on the high side for lunch, it was 50+ dollars with the food mentioned above and a Coke.  I'd eat at Chin Chin again but it wouldn't be something that is a must have",

I ordered a half order of the salad, and a bowl of soup, I believe it was called Max's soup, or something along those lines. My husband ordered the peanut noodles. Well, the salad was just as I remembered it...delicious! The soup, on the other hand was not. It had an odd taste...like boiled cabbage. I knew I made the wrong choice after I had just one spoonful. My husband's peanut noodles tasted like peanut butter overpowered by garlic! Not good. Price was okay, service was mediocre, and with the exception of my beloved chinese chicken salad, the food was yucky. Too bad. We should have known this wasn't going to be good by the way the girls working there bordered on begging us to eat there every time we walked by there on our way to and from the elevators.",

The food was very good actually, we didn't do the buffet since it was almost over so we did the a la carte menu, I was with 5 other people. The workers are very kind, but they said the portions were large but they were not enough, especially for the price. But overall, I was satisfied! If you ever visit, I loved the salmon crunch roll:)",

The appetizers did not taste as if they were made on site but purchased thru a service company (ex. Sysco ).  My friends ordered the sushi and ment I need it was pleasant but nothing to write home about. I ordered the General Tso Chicken.  My sauce was bitter (thinking it was mixed with something or not prepared correctly.  The wait staff was pleasant but slow.   I would skip this place and find something more appealing.  Please note that you can see the kitchen staff.   They too seem uninspired which is probably reflective of the food.",

Upon entrance the lovely hostess greeted me with a smile and with no hesitation offered me to take a look at the menu. The selection was perfect and they work with everyone's diets! I'm a pescatarian so often it's very difficult for me to find a place that can easily modify and accommodate something for me.  Their sushi menu was long, however not too overwhelming. When I saw that and their wine and sake selection, I was IN! The hostess walked me to my table. And you know how most hosts try to walk way in front of you and you almost have to sprint? They were actually mindful of me and walked beside me. I felt like they made an excellent first impression and my service began memorable. She even pulled out my seat. (Whaaaat) lol I know!   The server was top notch! His name was Pedro and he was on top of it. Very very energetic! My glass was never halfway empty, my table was manicured the entire time, and he sold me on desserts! I am on a diet!   The manager named Magy came by to visit my table. I typically don't like to be interrupted while I'm eating, but her approach was very friendly and she actually took the time to see what I thought about my food. I wanted to go to some nice wine bars and she pointed me towards some great wine spots.  The last time I was there I ordered Szechuan string beans, ordered it spicy and wowwww was it delicious. I ordered the Ma Po Tofu and the sauce was incredible. I tasted some black bean and authentic Chinese seasoning in it. It had a little spice to it just the way I like it and ordered a side of brown rice. Yes.. brown rice for those healthy people out there!  All in all, this place will give you a great experience upon entry, to food delivery, quality of food, and memorable service.   *check out the tips, they have a quality breakfast buffet, a FULL bar, brown rice, make riceless sushi (upon request), and DO NOT have MSG! :)*",

They had a breakfast buffet going on, and the friendly hostess suggested we go take a look. We did, and immediately decided to check it out.  The buffet was way nicer then any buffet we had on this trip. Everything was presented very tasteful and upscale. Very fresh, and nicely presented.   They have over 50 items including - red velvet pancakes, lychee fruit, sushi, French toast ect. A combination of both traditional brunch items and Asian food. If you come just as breakfast turns to lunch, you can experience both. You can also order a la carte off the menu if you prefer.   We liked it so much, that we ate here three times during our stay at NyNy. The service always was stellar ! Very friendly, courteous servers and cheery upbeat hostesses.   And if you check in on Yelp, it was buy one get one free lunch buffet ! It was an amazing deal.   Highly recommend!  Enjoy !",

I ordered pad Thai and my husband got the lunch buffet since it had orange chicken which he was planning on getting anyway. Maybe I'm spoiled by the Thai food we have near home, but this Pad Thai was not very good. Kinda bland and not very peanut-y. My husband barely ate anything from the buffet because it wasn't that good. I did snag a spring roll he wasn't going to eat and that was good. Overall, super overpriced for what it is. Won't come back the next time we are in Vegas.",

When we arrived, there were not many seating options available and we were placed at a tall table with chairs that did not have a back. Typically, I would've asked to be seated at a booth or lower table, as I find the tall tables and chair with no backs uncomfortable; however, I did not want to be difficult since they didn't have other seating options available.   Our waiter came up to our table promptly to give us menus and take our drink orders. He was friendly and patient with us as we waded through their huge menu. Their food menu is very extensive, which made it a difficult decision for us! The drink menu has good selection as well.   We decided to start off with their shrimp tempura roll. It was a good size and tasty as well. For our entree, we chose to split the crab and asparagus fried rice. First of all, I thought this was such a creative take on fried rice and one that I never would've thought of. Second, omg! Thank goodness we decided to split it because the portion was absolutely HUGE! My boyfriend and I each ate quite a bit of it and still had at least another good serving of it left.   Another cool feature of this place is that they have the sushi chefs working right at the bar so you can sit right in front of them and watch your sushi being rolled.   Our experience here was really great. We left feeling very full of delicious food and drinks. Our waiter was attentive but not annoying. Definitely recommend this place for a delicious meal.",

I went more with the sushi selection as they look really Yummy.  One item that really was tasty was the NEO roll it was sooo good it was like something put of the Matrix!!! Probably named after Keanu Reeves character lol. Good portions of food and bang for your buck meals cant go wrong.  Definitely will be coming for some eating repeats.

It was placed on a bed of cabbage (which I'm not personally a fan of, but I get the hype). The lemon sauce that came with it was to die for. I literally DRENCHED my chicken in it after a test taste. No regrets.   They were really up front that the sides are a la carte which I appreciated, but I do with it AT LEAST came with rice. I get buying alternative sides, but rice is a staple. It should be included in a $17 plate of glorified lettuce and a single breaded chicken breast. I'm just saying.   Other than that small little detail, perfect experience, highly recommend.",

We were seated quickly for a large group arriving for breakfast buffet. With a name like Chin Chin I was expecting something different. Chinese food is served for lunch and dinner in both order from the menu or buffet style...choose wisely.   We started with the featured omlets  that is included with buffet purchase.  The chefs prepare them fresh to order or you can create your own. Meat lovers, Cobb, Veggie, and the magnificent Seafood Omlette was my favorite with shrimp stuffed inside. Delicious! We the walked to the back of the restaurant where the buffet is located and we're amazed by the beautiful offerings like Salmon Eggs Bene, Stuffed Red Velvet pancakes, a variety of Egg Scrambles, and the very creative Breakfast Fried Rice.  All of the food was hot and fresh which sometimes can be a challenge at a buffet. Not here.    I had to save room for the sweets section. My favorite was the strawberry shortcake inspired croissant sammy stuffed with stawberries, whip cream and chocolate drizzle. Splendid!  Overall great experience at Chin Chin. Our entire large party left satisfied and minds blown with the level of service we received from Pedro R.  Vote for Pedro when you venture to Chin Chin.",

Anyways that's besides the point because we still went to eat Chinese food (I'm not Chinese but it's Asian so close enough), so I kept True to my Asian roots - phew.   Anyhow, we got there right before the rush, which I thought would be nice but nope, still waited for our food for what felt like forever (it was about 25 mins - so pretty much forever). I was going to knock them down 1 star for the wait but then when the food came I forgot all about the wait.   JESSICA SHUT UP, what did you eat?? Well damn don't be so rude. So friends, I got the Crispy Spicy Honey Shrimp thing and my friend got the gluten-conscious Honey Walnut Shrimp. BOTH WERE REALLY GOOD AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND. We also washed it down with 2 Lychee martini dranks. I would come back to order these two dishes but everything else looked meh and overpriced. I'd rather go to panda.",

I was very pleased to have received service with a smile, for some reason that simple principle is fading in the the service industry. The food was pretty good but the prompt service somehow made it taste better.  Appetizers! Chinese chicken salad! WOW Amazing! The ginger dressing phenomenal. Chicken potstickers with the sauce they serve (Apricot sauce) mix it with a little chilli paste.   Entree= Genral tso chicken (chicken breast), Szechuan string beans with chicken ex picked veggies, combo fried rice, Walnut Shrimp, and Singapore noodles!   Drinks= Bottle of Hidden crush (Cabernet blend) full bodied Cab, full of tannins that clear your palate so every bite is a first bite!   Servers were amazing and I say servers because everybody and their mother was so attentive with our party, even the manager Kyle checked on us to make sure that our food was to our liking.     If you are in Vegas Chin Chin is the place to go. they have a buffet and a shushi bar (maybe next time).   Will definitely be returning.   Prices are very reasonable and the portions are very generous!   After a good meal, time to GAMBLE!",

Again, I'm sorry CC staff, you guys are awesome, but I'd hate to steer a fellow Yelper wrong and out of his/her hard earned money. The sole redeeming item was the cheesecake crust. Pretty decent variety of desserts overall. I can't speak for the menu items, this is strictly a review of The lunch buffet, which I'd give a solid 1 star to, considering the price, but Jordan & her mgr brought it up two stars .Thank you both for redeeming what would have otherwise been a 1 star experience!",

    "text": "Spent this weekend in good ol' Vegas. My friend and I wanted to stop in and get our sushi fix. I have never been to this restaurant and was already expecting it to be on the pricey side since it's Vegas. Everything is overpriced. Anyways, they had a deal going on buy 2 sushi rolls, get the 3rd free. We figured that would be good so we ordered a dragon roll, rainbow roll and a lucky seven roll along with a dim sum appetizer called the assorted pleasures dish.  The appetizer came with 2 chicken pot stickers, 2 fried chicken wontons, 2 gift wrapped chicken pieces (chicken wrapped in foil w/cilantro) and a spring roll cut in half. The waitress brought out some dipping sauces. One of them was an apricot sauce that was similar to duck sauce which tasted amazing. I dunked the spring roll and pot sticker in that. The chicken pot stickers and wontons were both pink on the inside. I don't think the pot stickers were thoroughly cooked.  When our sushi came, all 3 rolls were on one plate. That only meant one thing: the rolls were tiny. And they were itty bitty. Don't get me wrong, the sushi was delicious but these rolls are priced out between $12-18 dollars. They were almost the size of a quarter. I hate to sound like a sushi snob, but I've had bigger rolls for less than $15 and of awesome quality. Well, what do you expect? It IS Vegas after all.  I'd say nay to the sushi next time and would probably try some of their other dishes.",

The walnut shrimp had way too much sauce on it,  if there was less sauce it would have been so much better. I doubt we will be eating here again.

And my boy friend ordered a noodle dish. Both were really good! A little on the pricier side (they charge $9 for 2 spring rolls!!

It's the strip in Vegas, so be prepared to pay strip prices. That said, the Salmon sashimi was some of the best and largest portions I've ever had. Sushi Chef Huynh was very friendly and approachable, he was available for recommendations as he received and cut all the fish himself so he knew what was freshest.  I also ordered the General Tso's chicken, which was good, but in retrospect I should've just had 2 more orders of sashimi.  I'll be back next time I'm in town, maybe for a happy hour next time so that I can afford more sushi.",

I was excited to get some tasty, tasty sushi but I was sorely disappointed when I got the menu and there were literally six items on the sushi menu. I should have cut my losses right then.  I ordered a Rainbow Roll and some Yellowtail. The yellowtail was alright but I was disappointed there was no roe. The Rainbow Roll was terrible!!! I'm used to getting at least eight decent sized peices out of a roll and for there to be healthy chunks of albacore inside the roll. Not here. This $16 roll was five peaces and was filled with Krab and enough mayo to clog my arterties. I ended up eating most of the rolls because I was hungry but toward the end, I picked the actually fish off the top. When the waiter returned, he commented that I hadn't finished everything and asked if I was too full. I told him no I wasn't too full, I was just really disappointed in the dish. He laughed and said he would finish my food for me, dropped the check and was never seen again.  Yuck.  He gets one star for tracking us down when my boyfriend forgot his credit card.",

But, seeing that I usually enjoy their breakfast buffet, I figured that I would like their dinner selection and service. We ordered 4 pieces of sashimi, chow fun, shu mai and pork dumplings. The sashimi was ok, comparable to grocery store grade. the chow fun was bland and I had to kill it with hot sauce to make it edible. The pork dumplings were a weird , tough gelatinous blob that I couldn't stomach. The only enjoyable part of the meal was the shu mai which was decent. The service was good and I have always been fond of this place for breakfast so I'll come back for that. But, pass on the dinner service-the food sucks!!!",

    "text": "So a friend and I decided to try this restaurant because it was convenient (we were staying in the hotel) and because the menu sounded promising.  We went for dinner and while the hostess was extremely nice our waiter left a lot to be desired. He didn't seem to be throughly impressed that he had to wait on someone (never smiled, never asked how we were). He took our drink orders, delivered them and then took our food orders.  I ordered the chicken mushu and my friend ordered the Jean's Long Life Noodles. The food came out and while I was mixing my food together I saw a piece of plastic in my food. Most people would complain about it and send it back but I already knew our waiter could have cared less so I just decided not to eat anymore and pick off my friends dish (which was tasty by the way). Our waiter never came by to see how our food was (no surprise there) and never offered us a dessert menu, he just came by and dropped off the check.  The funny part of this story is, when he saw me pull out a bunch of $100 bills he suddenly became extremely friendly towards us. I left a small tip for him (I used to work for tips as a blackjack dealer, so I sometimes feel guilty when I don't leave anything). I wasn't impressed with this place and wouldn't recommend it to people.",

I ate here on a Saturday night and had: Chow mein with crispy egg noodles and pork: Actually had to send this dish back because it was so horrible. It's like they took the noodles straight out of the container (instead of frying it crispy) and put the pork/veggies/sauce on top. The staff took it off my bill, which I appreciated.  Fried rice with pork: The darkest fried rice I've ever seen, with a lot of sauce! I've never had so much sauce in fried rice before. Also surprised that they didn't put any veggies in the rice...just pieces of pork and egg. Tasted okay.  Mongolian beef: Again, so much sauce! The meat slices were too thick and chewy. The white crunchies underneath were a waste.   Orange chicken: The most edible dish of the night. Good chunks of chicken and veggie  pieces. But the dish was lukewarm, like all the other dishes I had that night.   Prices were decent for a restaurant inside a hotel on the Strip ($15-$20 entrees), but I would rather spend the extra money for better food elsewhere.",

The menu is basically \"Asian\" with offerings from a few countries. We went for a couple pieces of hamachi, a spicy tuna roll and then the assorted satay.   The bar also seconds as a sushi bar and I love to watch the chefs do their thing. The bartenders are friendly. It's a nice vibe. No pretense here!   I'd give their sushi a solid 8/10. As for the satay - it comes with two each of beef, chicken and shrimp with assorted sauces, I'd give a 6.5/10. I think the flavors could have been a little more \"pow\".   Overall, I'd recommend as a quick bite or break from the casino floor. I've never eaten in the actual restaurant but the bar has the same menu.

In the past, I found the restaurant decent, but my most recent experiences tell me that it may be replaced or the existing operations management should be fired.  The place has no identity, it's not a great Chinese restaurant, mediocre sushi bar, and a poor attempt at recovering revenue by acting as a morning breakfast buffet with bland continental offerings with a splash of \" Asian\" flavor to concur with the theme.  Notice that there are more bad Yelp reviews of this place than good... Not a a good sign.  Food presented as large portions, but its a \"smoke and mirrors\" tactic. Mostly fillers and lacking in authentic flavor. Tastes like they took a wok and splashed the kitchen in there with an extreme amount of soy sauce without paying close attention to wok temp, and amount of the authentic spices, or lack thereof.  If you like Panda Express and want to overpay 3x its value then Chin Chin at NYNY will suit your tastes.",

The Grey Goose cosmo was served as it should be...ice cold.",

I suggest it for people who like more Americanized Chinese Restaurants. But.... 3 stars because some dishes are sour. Also, like I said before, I like authentic Chinese foods. If you're living in the hotel NewYorkNewYork, I feel like you should try it out! Just a bit (not really) too much vinegar. DON'T GET THE PEANUT NOODLES, YOU WILL FEEL LIKE YOU ARE EATING NOODLES WITH VINEGAR ONLY!!! Otherwise, it's pretty good!",

    "text": "I was staying at the NY NY and I headed straight for this restaurant after check in just because I love asian food, and none of the other food choices in the hotel really appealed to me (not that interested in italian, hot dogs, pizza or burgers -- boring).  As soon as I got there I asked for a booth -- they claimed they didnt have any although I'm pretty sure I saw some open in the back.  So I took a seat at the bar anyways, which I didnt really like because it's such a public area the way it's placed, with everyone walking by through the casino right next to me while I'm trying to eat.    First thing I do is look at the drinks menu -- only  a handful of cocktails with even less that look appealing. I ordered the lychee martini, and as it turns out, they can't make it because they stopped making the lychee liquor.  Alright. Well somehow tons of other restaurants still manage to serve these,so whatever. I ordered another drink in which I could taste the vodka way too much.    Then I ordered the cream cheese wontons.  The server comes back a few minutes later, and guess what, they don't have that either.  Alright, fine, I order gyoza instead.  Surprise surprise -- the server returns again and let's me know that they don't have gyoza either.  In fact they dont have any of the fried dim sum.  At an Asian restaurant. At 630 in the evening.  Seriously? They aren't apologetic about it at all.  I was pretty nice about it, albeit rightfully disappointing, which they didnt seem to appreciate for some reason.    So I went ahead and just ordered the crispy honey shrimp. I order that a lot at Elephant Bar, and it was pretty good here but not comparable.  The quality/texture of the meat was weird.  It seemed...dry?  I'm not sure how to explain it.  It was a   Not a particularly enjoyable experience, and maybe they should stock up better next time.  From here on out I'll just stick to Ra Sushi -- its on the other side of the strip but it's worth the trip!",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I love traditional Chinese food. Chin Chin  is not that.  It's Asian/American fusion, which means taking the best part of Chinese food and blending in other elements to get something incredibly special.  And that's exactly what Chin Chin is.  I usually go to the Beverly Hills and Brentwood locations, and the food is consistently good; this review is solely for the Vegas location.   Decor is trendy nouveau Chinese, always neat and clean.  Noise level is low.  Staff is friendly.  So far, so good....and then it gets better.  Our party of 6 (this was for a business trip, Imagine the President, Vice President, Regional Manager, Operation manager, General manager and my self and we only went to Chin Chin because i told them that it was Great!) started off with the not-to-be-missed fried wontons and chicken salad.  Luscious!  We then  rolled into the main dishes which we requested be served family style: Sweet and Sour Chicken - very good; Beef with Broccoli - very good; and Kung Pao Scallops, which pegged the needle on the delicious-meter.  (If you don't like spicy dishes then drop that last one and go sit at the little kids table, you baby.)  This was accompanied by crab asparagus fried rice and steamed rice, done to perfection as always.  But we were still hungry, so we ordered the Garlic Eggplant.  Awesomeness!    Having filled up on main courses we did not partake of the formidable dessert menu, but it was tempting.  Now, about the service.  Our server (Juan),  his name must be in a plaque somewhere in the Server Hall of Fame.  He was everything a perfect server should be; funny, charming, and with a comprehensive knowledge of the menu, he really added an element of pleasure to the meal.  No hyperbole, this guy was the real deal.Chin Chin needs to put him under contract.  Ask for him, you won't be disappointed.  The prices are reasonable for a really nice sit-down place.  The inspired flavors of the dishes makes it all worth it.  After a good meal hit the slot machines. I prefer the ones by the exits since those are the ones that usually pay the most.",

    "text": "I would first like to say that I woke up with my family at 8a.m to eat breakfast at Chin Chin's breakfast buffet. Lets just say I'm not the happiest camper.  First, I would like to say I am extremely disappointed at myself for not paying attention at the hints for an extremely horrible breakfast.   TIP #1 Breakfast Buffet at a mediocre Chinese Restaurant Tip #2 Fried Rice as part of their breakfast menu Tip #3 pastries that i saw them un-package from a Costco type package.  No i didn't take any of those hints as a clue to what was in store for me.   The Food- They serve the usual breakfast fare. Eggs, bacon, sausage, and french toast. To accompany those types of food they have fried rice, bbq pork, assorted fruits and potatoes. The breakfast was so sub-par, so unseasoned i couldn't eat more then one plate. I even asked for cheese for my scrambled eggs and they said they cant give me that... REALLY... REALLY?!  The Price- Everything they serve you can get at a Days-inn that is included with the price of the room. It is $12.95 a person. With that price you can go to Hash House a gogo and get quite honestly the best breakfast in Vegas for the same price. Hell you can go to Circus Circus breakfast buffet and get better. At least they have omelette's and  toast. THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TOAST HERE! Silly me to think that a breakfast buffet would serve toast... silly me.  So I'm giving this place one star, If i could i would give it 1/2 but i can't. I honestly can't believe their are restaurants out here that have the audacity to serve such sub-par, and un-edible food at such a outrageous price.  1/2 A STAR OUT OF 5  p.s THEY DON'T SERVE TOAST!",

It was very rude and the waiter (The name on my receipt was Erin, but I am not sure that was the waiter's name) kept being a smart-ass to the shushi chef the whole time I was there, even making me wait for my check so he could ask the shushi chef if I was ready for it. So immature!  That being said, the roll the chef made for me was pretty fantastic, he would have gotten five stars easily. The fish was fresh and there was just the right amount of spice.
