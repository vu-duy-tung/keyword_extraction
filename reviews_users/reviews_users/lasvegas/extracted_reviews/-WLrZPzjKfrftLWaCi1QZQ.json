I love this place because it doesn't try to be something that it's not (fancy or full of gimmicks).   Omlets are HUGE (made with 4 eggs where most diners use 3) and the pancakes are a meal in itself (couldn't finish the whole grain pancakes and I can normally eat for 2). Would recommend, will def be back soon!!",

Lots of choices and they pretty much have any combination of anything you could want. The portion sizes are huge so come with your appetite.   Prices are high like anywhere in Vegas and last I checked $14 for an omelette is high. They will overwhelm you with quantity not necessarily quality. It's good don't get me wrong but it's not mind blowing, nor should it be. It's a great little place that isn't Denny's or Village Inn. Give it a shot and see.",

We came here after a long evening and not everyone was in the best mood since we were hungry and tired. The waitress was overwhelmed. Way too many tables for just two waitresses and one busboy from what I could see. She was friendly and tried be as attentive as she could given the circumstances.   My omelet was ok, nothing spectacular but a solid meal. There was lots of meat and it was gigantic for the price. It did the trick. They have an enormous menu with everything your heart could desire to eat. I usually stick with the breakfasts, but they have a huge amounts of lunch and dinner options as well. When I'm looking for some very late night breakfast I usually head to Blueberry Hill. I also really enjoy breakfast as dessert. Nothing satisfies my sweet tooth like some french toast, crepes or pancakes, yum.  Everyone else in my party seemed a little perturbed by the service, but I really have to give them credit for doing the best they could while in the weeds and still keep an upbeat and positive attitude.   Not the greatest restaurant, but hopefully the manager will put more staff during peak hours to take care of guests.",

    "text": "This place was good, but not mind-blowing. For some breakfast in Vegas, great stop. It is essentially a non-commercial version of IHOP--similar prices, dishes, etc. however I must say their blueberry pancakes were bomb. We went in with a table of 8 and were seated relatively quickly, were asked what we wanted to order in less than a minute (which was kind of overwhelming with this size of the menu), re-asked quickly and served quickly.   In having gotten the blueberry pancakes for myself I was quite pleased with my meal (plus potatoes, eggs and sausages on the side), however others at my table got the cornbeef hash (ehh, ok), a Tex-Mex style omelet (ok), and other variations.   They have large portions and I may return. Probably not, for breakfast previously I went to a cafe in the Venetian which was cute, quaint, and delish.",

From the outside it doesn't look like a huge, 5 star chain restaurant, but it's even better than IHOP or Denny's hands down. I had an amazing chicken waffle breakfast and it was an incredibly delicious and filling meal! The staff was very attentive and very efficient. It's a great place to enjoy a meal with relatives, for breakfast early in the AM or after a long shift at work. The ambience allows you to relax and settle down after a busy day. I love coming to Blueberry Hill and highly recommend it over any other chain restaurants of similar variety.",

He offered me a remake, free food, ect. I told him I didn't want that. It was so good as it was. They were really busy and we were still seated right away.

We were staying at an Airbnb, so I knew I could box the leftovers.   We walked in on a busy Saturday morning around 10:00. The wait time was a short 5-10 minutes.   I was hoping to see pumpkin on the menu, since it was October, but no dice. I was just about to settle for blueberry, but that idea was abandoned when I spotted the cinnamon roll pancakes. Cinnamon roll batter baked inside the pancakes with a thick drizzle of icing. The pancakes were even better than I had expected. I'm not a huge cinnamon fan to begin with, but the pancakes were amazing. The cinnamon sugar was caramelized on one side, giving the fluffy cakes a perfect crusty texture. The cinnamon topping, along with the icing drizzle and whipped cream, left no need for syrup.   My boyfriend allowed me to snag a potato from his skillet dish. Deep fried, crispy little nuggets were the perfect vehicle for sopping up the yolk from his over easy eggs.  Our server was busy, but attentive and never let our coffee mugs reach empty. When I asked for a to-go box, she came back with plastic forks and a side of syrup (I love an intuitive server)",

It appears there maybe a leak along the plumbing route in the ceiling. The decor is late 80's - early 90's southwestern peach and blue shades, gold trim and dirty wallpaper. Meaning it's never been upgraded.  THE FOOD!!!!  We had the Eggs Benedict  and the Honey Coconut Chicken and Waffles! Neither dish disappointed.

    "text": "I've lived in Vegas for nearly four years now and have always wondered if Blueberry Hill was well, legit! I drive past it all the time and it never dawned on me that this place might in fact be good! Breakfast, lunch, and dinner is offered here and this place is definitely a mom-and-pop style diner that locals as well as tourists enjoy. It's a good option for tourists who are looking to dine off of the Strip. Plus, it's open 24 hours!  I convinced my family to come here one night for a late dinner and after our experience, I'm still not sure if I'm a fan or not. The menu is very expansive and well designed. The tabs make it easy to flip through the different categories.   I ordered the Blueberry Hill-Style Monte Cristo Sandwich- Turkey and ham smothered with Swiss cheese, grilled on French toast bread that apparently isn't deep-fried or breaded. First of all, the serving sizes at Blueberry Hill are huge! My sandwich looked overwhelming and was packed with meat. I mean PACKED! There was so much turkey and ham that it was hard to take a bite! I definitely was not able to finish my meal, especially with the thick French toast. It was good, but I don't think I would order this again because after a few bites, the taste became old.  My dad ordered the Downhome Dixie Meatloaf which also seemed to be a bit overwhelming. It looked extremely rich, but he enjoyed it. My mom however, was not satisfied with her steak and eggs because it was cooked too long. It was on the dry side, but our waitress was very apologetic and compensated for her meal.  The customer service was friendly, but I feel like they were understaffed at the time. There were only two waitresses on shift during our visit and although it was 9 o'clock at night, I felt as if they should've been more prepared as more guests started to flow into the diner.  I'll probably have to try it one more time to completely make up my mind. The breakfast menu looks tempting!",

Don't know that you could go wrong here with any dish but would make a special point to tell anyone to try the all-fruit crepes. The cheese filling is lighter than most places and less sugary. It's awesome.",

Off the strip, busy but they'll move the line quickly and it's worth the wait. Friendly staff, good service and great food. I had the apple pancakes and there's more than enough to share! Good coffee too, and they'll bring you milk on the side if you ask and don't want the fake creamers. They were able to seat our table of 6 plus infant with ease, and we didn't feel rushed, able to stay and talk plenty. My husband had an omelette, others had the chicken fried steak, coconut chicken and waffles and the cinnamon roll pancakes. Everything looked amazing! It's a casual diner, so we're not talking fine dining, but it's a great late breakfast/brunch place to hang.",

It was well organized in sections which anyone will find very helpful because it was categorized.   I ordered the Philly cheesesteak omelette. It was a little disappointing because it was bland. He eggs were overcooked which made the whole meal tough to dig in. The meat was rubbery. I didn't finish my plate.   Hubby ordered Tennessee steak and eggs. According to him, it was okay. Nothing special. He said it was cooked the way he liked it  but not something he would order again.   The kids ordered pancakes. 'Twas alright. They liked how they were shaped liked happy faces with chocolate chips. Amused them the whole time.   Overall, I'd still come to try the other things they have in the menu. Then maybe I could give an updated review. Until then, I'd give it a 3 star.",

Prices are about $15-$20 per person with drink but considering portions are bigger than normal, I don't might the prices at all. Next time you're in Vegas make a quick stop and prove me wrong... I dare you. Sorry no pics today because I ate everything before I thought about taking any pics. ENJOY!",

    "text": "Roach! Roach! Roach!!!    How disgusting can a restaurant be?!?!  We dined at this particular Blueberry Hill restaurant last weekend because we were all in the mood for breakfast food, and we were in the area.  It was late in the evening, so we were told that we could sit anywhere we wanted.  We selected one of the round/horseshoe shaped booths in the corner.  Our meal was great.  We had absolutely no complaints as far as the food or service was concerned.  However, we were totally grossed out and ready to puke when a roach came to pay us a visit in our booth.  The roach was moving really slowly, almost ready to die, which was great because that made it possible for our waitress to see it when we called her over.  The look on her face was one of pure disgust.  She apologized and walked over to the counter to tell another waitress.  At this point, we were all standing and ready to run out of there to take steaming hot baths!!!  No one came back over to the booth where we were standing at, so we walked to the front counter.  The main waitress told us that there was no bill due to the inconvenience.  No duh!!!  Ya think?!?!  I truly believe that when you see one roach, that means there is an infestation.  Especially when you have bold roaches that come out to dine with you.  I came onto Yelp to peruse the other reviews of this location to see if anyone else had any other unfortunate experiences with roaches.  I did a quick search of the reviews by typing \"roach\" into the review search engine, and sure enough three other reviews popped up with the same issue of roaches in their booth/table.  Shame on Blueberry Hill for allowing such filth.  There are no exceptions, and I will never, ever, ever step foot in this place again.",

You're first greeted by the charming hostess who welcomes you and seats you to your table. What's pretty incredible about this place is that no matter which one of their morning crew waitstaff is your server, each one of them makes you feel as if they are so darn glad you're there, and makes you feel like you're the most important person. To finish it all off, the food is absolutely amazing, but heed my warning, you better come hungry because the portions are over the top. Definitely my favorite breakfast restaurant in town.",

While the huge menu was a bit overwhelming, we stuck with our favorites and weren't disappointed. I had the coconut chicken and waffles and it was out of this world... plus a side of what may have been the best biscuits and gravy I've ever had. I also had a few bites of the french toast, which was so flavorful I couldn't believe it.

My friend and I did a mini-vacay and had breakfast here twice.  First time I had the eggs scrambled with ham and three giant, fluffy buttermilk pancakes that just may have de-throned Norm's Restaurant as \"the king of pancakes.\"  And they serve real butter, too!  Second time I had the honey coconut chicken and waffles which I very much enjoyed although I prefer that my fried chicken not have coconut, so next time I would order something else.  Everything is prepared from scratch, and my mouth was watering at all the delicious options, especially the eggs Benedict and chicken parmigiana.  This is down-home American food at its best.

It was kind of rude when some of us were genuinely really asking for opinion. Especially when you go, \"can I ask you a question\" and in all seriousness, her reply was , \"no\".  Who does that.  Whatever.   The Fried Chicken & Waffle was pretty delicious.. devoured that quick.  I also enjoyed their egg benedict that I shared with my friend. Simple and easy.  Pretty good for the price.

The AMERICAN fries showed home made on the menu but were frozen cubes in reality.    The ham steak was cold with no grill or fry marks  The toast was OK. It was toasted and buttered.   The clerk again never asked about our experience, just took our money and sent us on our way.    If you are looking at ordering just toast you are probably OK.  Otherwise Blueberry Hill has gone downhills.",

Brisk service in that old family owned, diner vibe. You feel like a regular on your first visit. Weekends are super busy so I usually head for the counter and grab a stool with no waiting.  I mean the food is good but the service is amazing. I come for the service and I always leave feeling good. This place is managed with a sense of excellence and is a well-oiled machine.",

She barely attended to our table when giving out order she didn't inform us of any extra charges, brought out ticket out too early posted it face up standing with bill showing cost and didn't even ask if we wanted boxes.   I tell everyone I know to come here whenever they're coming to Vegas because usually the waitresses are sweethearts the food is amazing but Gail you made rethink that.  For anyone coming here I still recommend the food is great but make sure you don't get Gail",

I usually only frequent the location closest to my home, but I've been on the East side a lot for work and have popped in a couple of times.  Service is quick, food is out hot and fresh, and the menu is massive so there's something for everyone, for every meal, making it good for groups. They have a breakfast taco plate that is okay (I prefer it eggs only, without the meat) and their omelets are enough to serve as your only meal for the entire day. I don't come here regularly but it never disappoints.",

    "text": "I was going to give my usual 4 star review to indicate this restaurant as a very good option deserving of a visit while in Las Vegas. The decor is definitely pre-modern pink interior, old vintage-off the strip, good coffee, breakfast restaurant.  The server was very nice, attentive and on time for refills, etc., considering it was very busy that Saturday morning.   My omelette was good at best, as expected,  not bad...not bad at all. My wife had biscuits and gravy, which she proclaimed very good, saying her biscuits(don't make a joke of that statement...it's Vegas. OK.)were tender and delicious. So we were really feeling good  about finding an off strip breakfast eatery, that we didn't have to drop a \"Ben Franklin\" just for breakfast.  Then we bit into the Cinnamon Swirl Shortstack of pancakes with a shot of whipped cream on them and as requested,  and warm syrup to pour over this \"cinnamony\" goodness... OK, time to up my rating to a 5 star review.   I try to reserve my 5 star ratings to let you know, if you are in the area. This should be on your list of the top 5 things, places or activities you should try to get in on while visiting an area. I'm positive there are endless options that \"outshine\" this eatery in Vegas.  But I'm sure you won't be disappointed making BHFR a stop while in \"Sin City\".",

Even after the moved over to another table to get out of his sight he still managed to peek over where we were. Our waiter came over 2 times, to bring us beverages and then to bring us the food.

When we walked in the place was packed, a clear sign that it's popular with locals and tourist. Even though we were a large party, they were able to seat us fairly quickly. The menu was large they have everything from breakfast to burgers. I opted for the \"Waitress Special\" the Belgium waffle that came with it was fluffy and amazing! I'd highly recommend there pancakes and desserts. Overall nice diner with amazing food at a for price. Would love to visit again.",

BIG, Fluffy, old fashioned buttermilk pancakes that taste like heaven with blueberries (I hope there are blueberries in heaven). Our second dish was the waffles and chicken. The chicken was perfectly crispy on the outside and moist and tender inside. The sweet waffle shouldn't have worked but it did!

We sat down and after looking at the menu I was impressed with the selection and how tasty everything looked. The food came and it was mostly decent. There were a few problems such as finding spinach in one friends omelet (after she told them she was allergic), and some rotten & unwashed grapes in the fruit side. We managed to get through most of the meal and were fairly content. That is until each of the four of us began heading to the restroom with our stomachs churning before we could even leave. The food went right through each of us in a bad way taking away any previous good thoughts I had of the place. The only thing we each had were eggs so I'm guessing that might be the culprit. But after seeing the carelessness of the food we were served I think its safe to say they aren't following strict habits of cleanliness in this restaurant.   I'm only giving this place the one star cause I think it has potential with that menu. But I'd honestly tell everyone to go some place else where you don't have a horrible urge to remove what you just ate from your system shortly after eating it.",

This location has been codenamed \"the good one\" by Boyfriend and I, so we make the trip on Saturday mornings rather than go to the location right up the street. This location just seems better put together than the others. As a twosome, we are usually seated very quickly. The service is not exceptional, but leaves nothing to be desired. The waitresses are exactly what you'd expect in a diner (after walking in the doors, you have no name. You'll be known as \"honey\" or \"sweetie\").   I can honestly say that I've never gotten a non-breakfast item, given that breakfast is awesome and served 24 hours. My guilty pleasure is the eggs benedict. Whether you get actual poached eggs or not is a toss-up, but it's still tasty. Really, I've never been disappointed.   The Hill is a step down from The Cracked Egg in price and taste, but still quite a few steps from the bottom!",

After enjoying a bit of the Las Vegas nightlife, our companions suggested we get some early morning grub at one of their dining spots. Immediately after we devoured our meal, my wife and I responded in unison, \"why hadn't they told us about this place before!\" This place was so good, we ate there again the following morning! The food was delicious, the prices were cheap, and the service was awesome! If you dine here during or after the bewitching hour, ask to be served by \"Cornbread.\" This guy was amazing...he will definitely take care of you. Entree suggestions: anything and everything on their menu! If you can't find something you'd like at this place, then you possess a lack of taste buds. Open 24/7, with daily specials and a wide assortment of delectable delights to choose from, I highly recommend Blueberry Hill Restaurant Bar and Bakery!",

    "text": "Sadly, the only thing that was tasty were the things that were NOT homemade. The hash browns were slices of mushy potato and not seasoned right. The gravy is easy to make and very basic but tasted OK, as it should, though, nothing special. I ordered over medium eggs and they were over hard. I'm very particular about this having been a breakfast cook for many years. The chicken fried steak I could almost guarantee was frozen and not fresh but not because of the flavor. It tasted good but just a guess from other hints. Didn't matter about that but was just disappointed that all of the homemade things were not standing out like they seemed so proud of. If it weren't for the nicely cooked frozen fried steak, my rating would be lower. So, if they didn't try bragging that it's all homemade, I probably would've never known and possibly given higher. Server needs to season with less sugar, if you know what I mean. Almost like she was expecting a review. I kind of expect a cranky server because that's how they are on the east coast so it actually lost its 'diner' feel.",

    "text": "\"You've never been to Blueberry Hill?\" asks the incredulous Vegan when I say after living here three years I've never eaten at the casual restaurant. \"Oh, you have to go, it's a Vegas staple!\"  So after a few drinks we needed something open late. We couldn't agree on a place open late that sounded good to everyone, and Blueberry Hill was close by.  Blueberry Hill is open 24 hours. It all goes downhill from there.  I ordered the chilequilas, which I had never had before. I guess they're like breakfast nachos. The food was absolutely mediocre at best. Now I know it's 1am, and fine dining isn't exactly what I'm looking for, but it at least should make me go \"Yum!\" instead of \"Oh...\" And around us, between the four, nothing was a stand out at all. Nothing said to us, \"Damn, that's what we SHOULD have ordered.\" (Although H. San's pancake stack looked mildly appealing.)  Service was awful. Again, I know it's 1am, and if you're a little understaffed, I understand. Grave is not an easy shift. But it doesn't take that long to refill a soda or coffee. How do I know this? Because after she had asked if we wanted refills, she proceeded to forget AND REFILL EVERY OTHER TABLE before a busser offered us refills.  So yeah. It'll be a long time before I come back to this dump. There, I've been to Blueberry Hill, I've done my duty as a Las Vegan, now leave me alone!",

This is a real diner... looks like it could've come outta the 70's even. haha  Anyway, I used to go to UNLV and live so close to this location, so it's a favorite of mine.  They have an extensive menu that offers dinner on one side and all-day breakfast on the other.  They make everything from scratch.  Everything I've had here was excellent.  And finally, large portions for reasonable prices 24 HOURS A DAY... what more could you want?!?!  I almost always get the Waitress Special, which is a Belgian Waffle that melts in your mouth like clouds.  I like their sausage links with it... and over-medium eggs.  *sigh*  If I'm not in the mood for breakfast however, I'll get their grilled cheese sandwich with chili... nom nom nom.  And their carrot cake rocks!  Wish they had a Blueberry Hill in S. Bay...  See ya there!",

Not low proces but just fair.  Actually, I tried to jot down a review durring my stay in Blueberry Hill but something whent wrong with the wi-fi connection.

A friend and I came in around 1:30pm for breakfast for lunch. Half of the restaurant was being used and that half was pretty busy. Busy is a good sign, I guess.  It was quite a bit of a wait for our food. I noticed other parties who came in after we did receive their food first. When the food finally came, I was disappointed in the size and quality of the breakfast skillet. It was not very hot, and the potatoes were greasy. They skimped on sausage and peppers, and the scrambled eggs on top looked as if they had been shrunk dry. I've received much better skillets from Denny's, and theirs aren't great either. All the flavor came from the ketchup I added. The fruit crepes were missing strawberry, but at this point we had waited so long we weren't going to complain. The cheese filling was good. Not sure if I'd return. I'd rather pay less elsewhere for better quality food.",

This place smashes Denny's and IHOP forsure, it's just a bummer that the menu is a typical American, SUPER PORTIONS and SUPER fried, greasy, fatty foods.  There are much better places to eat with better prices and choices.  I usually frequent this place to get drunk somewhere that's not a bar or casino.  The service here is pretty sucky.  Not a single time coming here have I not had to wait JUST for a menu or water.  After ordering there were multiple times the order just didn't come out and was forgotten.  So what's the point trying to give you any of my money xD?  Whatever it is, there isn't enough excuses to have multiple visits botched by multiple reasons that shouldn't even have happened in the first place when it comes to service.  If mistakes are made many businesses will comp a dish or give you something on the house or whatever.  Nah not here, it's the customers fault xD  Just avoid coming here.  Only really old people who don't care about their health or dollars come here cuz it's a nostalgia bomb of that diner with that heavy breakfast feel to it.",

Blueberry hill reminded me of iHop, the menu is so huge, there's sooooo much to choose from, doesn't help an indecisive girl like me ;(.   The boyfriend was craving steak and eggs, so he ordered the 10oz rib eye with 3 eggs ($14). He ordered medium and it came out well done, we didn't bother sending it back because the food already took a while to come out. The steak was pretty bland and extremely dry, very hard to chew. The hash browns and eggs were good, but it's almost impossible to screw up eggs and hash browns ..   I ordered the French toast combo, it came with 2 pieces of French toast, 2 eggs and 3 links of sausage. My combo was good, but then again ... eggs and sausage are so basic that it's almost impossible to screw up. The French toast was really good and not too sweet.   Overall, probably wouldn't return unless I'm really craving that French toast.",

Been here for 3 times in a week now and I can say they are running a good show; although it's always but don't stress out because you will be seated right away. Food will be served fast and it's satisfying. All the staff are very attentive and friendly plus the price is so reasonable. PS: they also have a mexican food included in the menu and cakes for dessert!",

The coffee here is really good too and comes in cute old-timey diner mugs.  My husband says the pancakes were the BEST - very hard to find really good pancakes these days!  My Eggs Benedict Florentine was delicous (because I added bacon of course) with perfectly poached eggs.   Every time we come to Vegas, we HAVE to have breakfast at Blueberry Hill.  It's delicious, satisfying and incredibly affordable!",

Plus, the food itself tastes like they're make boxed cakes and canned gravy! It was not worth the money at all. The waitresses are nice, and they're quick and that's the only reason I gave them 2 stars instead of 1. I'm never coming back after this last visit. Pro tip: never order their chocolate cake. I couldn't make it through 2 bites! So fake and disgusting.",

They had an option of hash browns or potatoes . The potatoes were soooo good. The eggs Benedict was so good, everything was just amazing . My dad ordered ham and eggs with pancakes. The pancakes were fluffy with he perfect taste and I don't even like pancakes!!   My waiter was pretty terrible unfortunately . He continuously forgot my mom's order (he asked her 3x's) we waited 15 minutes for coffee when it's the first thing we ordered, and we didn't get our juice until our meal was almost over when we ordered it with the meal. It wasn't too busy. We came on a Saturday around 12 but the waiter was just not very attentive to our party. Other than that I am headed back to this place in the next couple weeks to see what else is on the menu!",

One thing I loved about their menu is everything is included in their meals they dont try to nickel and dime you for extras. All meals are complete for eg. you came for pancakes well you get pancakes, eggs, bacon and potatoes for under $12  My wife ordered the 1-2-3 biscuit meal after all she loves biscuits and gravy these were the best shes had. Meal came with 2 huge biscuits smothered in gravy along with bacon and eggs. Sh ordered a side of potatoes. The gravy was served thick with bits of sausages inside. The Biscuits were buttery, salty and Flaky; perfection. She also enjoyed the breakfast potatoes we asked for crispy potatoes blueberry did not dissapoint they were served hot, crispy outside soft inside.   I opted for the burger-steak with potato pancakes and eggs. Portion was HUUUUUGE! and deeeeeelicious. Loved the flavors all infused together. Biscuits on the bottom potato pancakes in the middle and burgersteak on top I asked for my gravy on the side. Get this one you will not finish it and you will not be dissapointed. The burgersteak was cooked perfectly goood steaky flavor. Potatoe pancakes were soft and crispy, again biscuits soft, salty and flaky with thick gravy; eggs were eggs honestly could have this meal without eggs sooo much food.",

The location looked a bit run down. The atmosphere was cold and busy; and the food was blah!  Our server was okay at first but than l felt a lil bothered after his constant return to the table. I felt like we were being rushed and we were only into 5min of having our food. The pancakes looked amazing but were tastless. The biscuits and gravy were not good and what l enjoyed most was my pepsi and toast.   I was not a happy person when l left.",

It took me having to flag down three servers before being able to get a refill on my iced tea. Other than that, the service was fine. The food was kind of bland and required salt (I hate having food that requires me to add salt to flavor). Next time I'm in Las Vegas, this place will not be on my 'return to' list.",

The skillet was tasty, but it was 70% potatoes which was very disappointing. Not much sausage, peppers, or onions even though I asked for extra onions. I posted a picture of the potatoes that were left over - waaaayyyy too many. I really would have liked more meat and veggies. I also ordered a side of country gravy, which the menu said you could order a side for free, but I was charged an extra $2 so that was disappointing. The biscuit I got on the side was huge and delicious. I would honestly go back just for biscuits and gravy. Would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a hearty meal!",

It's a great place for family outings, casual dates, or lunch with a friend. The menu is extensive and they have comfort food galore. My favorite thing on the menu is definitely the French toast. It's so sweet and buttery, but it doesn't have an overbearing egg coating as lots of other French toasts that I have tried. The portion sizes are pretty large and the prices reasonable. It's got a cute 90's style vibe and the staff is always friendly! I love taking my family here for breakfast every now and then. Awesome, awesome place.",

Essentially a fancy diner, they're not going to knock your socks off with esoteric and strange cuisine, but you will find more than enough comfort food to keep you happy.  The service is always friendly and the portions ample.  Generally this is a breakfast spot for us. They have fancy pancake concoctions that keep my other half intrigued, while I go for the savory breakfast items, ranging from steak and eggs to breakfast skillets to huevos rancheros etc.   Coincidentally, years ago this is the first place we tried that exotic concoction known as chicken and waffles. Fried chicken served over a Belgian waffle was unexpectedly delicious. These days everyone has taken it to new levels, bacon sriracha cheese waffles etc...but sometimes the original is more satisfying.  I always go away happy, and that's kind of what it's all about. If you're in town and happen across this review, this is a good place to cure your hangover, or fulfill your cravings for comfort food ranging from American diner fare to Mexican to Burgers to you name it!",

The meals came out and everything was HUGE! Massive amounts of mouthwatering food sat in front of us. I posted a pic of the pancake next to a dollar bill for size comparison. All was de-frikin-licious!  All the staff were killin' it - we were even impressed by the busboy, Valentino, who busted his ass making sure all the tables were cleaned and set up for the next customer - and still smiled at us every time he walked by. Raven was very friendly and attentive. Again, this will be a regular spot for us from now on.  VERY GOOD",

    "text": "No way was I getting caught in Denny's jail again, so I whipped out the Yelp app and typed in \"breakfast\" and this joint popped up. The general consensus seemed to be that this chain was a Vegas institution worth eating at at least once. Actually, based on most reviews it sounds like people don't recommend doing so more than once. I was in dire need of some foodstuffs, and the lure of a mountain of blueberry pancakes sold me quickly.   From the outside, it looks like a beat-down, antiquated Denny's wannabe; it doesn't look much different inside, either. We got a seat immediately and soon enjoyed the waitressing service of the sweetest old woman I've met since my grandma. Unfortunately, we got seated within earshot of a woman with the most annoying laugh I've ever heard on this planet in 29 years. It sounded like a hyena in the throes of lust with a frightened chimp. We looked lost in the gargantuan menu, so she made a few suggestions based on what we wanted. I went with 2 blueberry pancakes, 2 scrambled eggs and 3 strips of bacon. I really wanted the banana pancakes, but they couldn't be ordered in a combo. Crapola.   The food came up fast & hot - but the quality greatly varied. My blueberry pancakes were divine. The cakes were pillowy and moist, drenched with a blue viscous syrup and liberally peppered with fresh blueberries. No syrup required here - these cakes need to be eaten au natural. My eggs were.... eh, gross. I wish they weren't, but they were. I don't think they'd been properly cooked, so they were a little on the \"runny snot\" side in terms of consistency, and they tasted funky. The bacon was neither super crispy nor soft & chewy; it was just kinda there. There for me to eat. So I ate it. Luckily, the pancakes were so large that I was able to start on them, take a break to eat everything else, then go back to finish them off and to get the taste of the eggs out of my mouth.   If I were to come back here again, I think I'd only order something pancake related. Being a protein hound, this isn't my ideal breakfast, but their pancakes are really friggin' good. I'll probably return one more time to get the banana cakes, but that'll likely be the end of my relationship with Blueberry Hill. The rest of their food is decidedly mediocre, but the pancakes are mouth watering and the service was exquisite.",

    "text": "This place is a local chain that is fairly dependable and reasonably priced. The Flamingo location, like all the others, gets busy from 9-12 on the weekends. But even during those busy times there is never an uncomfortable wait.   They have a crew of experienced waitresses, but lately they have been training new waitresses during those busy times.  This of course leads to some missteps, but it's never a huge inconvenience.  And the waitresses are always nice.     There was a menu shift a few years ago and Blueberry Hill revamped their menus at every location. They started offering more selections. It seemed to be an effort at competing with some of the national chains. Suddenly there were big laminated books filled with pictures of Chocolate Oreo Pancakes and Chilaquiles. I stay away from the Mexican food on the breakfast menu. It's OK at best.  Overall the quality of some of their dishes seemed to suffer a bit as a result of the changes. Hubby says the chicken fingers and ham steak have declined in the last few years.  The omelets and combos are still solid. I stick with my standby, the Waitress Special (eggs, waffle, and bacon or sausage).  Their waffle is a tasty surprise.  I've never been unhappy with it.     On Sundays there is often a kid out front selling the local paper. Even if you don't buy a paper from him, he holds the door for you. I haven't seen him for a while; I hope he's still around.  POSITIVE CHANGE: They carry Twinings Tea now.  That might not impress tea lovers, but it's a huge step up from the Lipton they've been carrying for years.   IN RETROSPECT: This hasn't been a positive review in the traditional sense. But it is a positive review. They are open 24 hours. I know what I'm going to get at Blueberry Hill. The wait is never long. The waffles are good.  And the people are pleasant.  In spite of the changes, I still like it here.",

Definitely a mouth watering experience while waiting to be seated.   The server was very friendly and kept our glasses filled with our drinks.  I ordered biscuits and gravy with a side of bacon.  The biscuits were two of the biggest biscuits that I have seen (at home or at a restaurant), yet they were light, fluffy and very tasty.  In the end, I couldn't both of them, they were so big.  As a personal preference, I do wish the gravy was a little thicker, but that didn't detract from the taste at all.  The bacon was cooked just right, a little crispy but still juicy and not over cooked at all.   Everyone at the table agreed that their meals were very good, no complaints about the food. The seats could have been a little more comfortable and the bathrooms needed more attention, but that shouldn't dissuade anyone from enjoying a very good meal at Blueberry Hill.   I'll come back for more on my next trip to Vegas.",

With four famished marathon runners, we needed a place to grub down and luckily someone suggested Blueberry Hill (a favorite for him).  He chose this location as his regular joint.  I was a little concerned with how long the wait might be on a Sunday around noon, but the wait was only ten minutes or so.  Thank goodness!  After getting seated, huge menus were given to us.  Woah!  This restaurant is open 24 hours and the menu reflects that.  There's a whole lot of menu to go through, especially the breakfast items alone!  Definitely take your time making your decision!  * Golden Stuffed French Toast \" Four thick wedges of French toast stuffed with cream cheese and lavished with your choice of fresh strawberry or blueberry or apple compote, or pineapple spiced rum and coconut compote.\" ($7.79) - The French Toast was recommended by the regular and I went for the blueberry topping (obviously), although the pineapple spiced rum and coconut one did tempt me just a bit.  I loved the sweetness from the fruit topping and whipped cream, but then I would get this tangy sour taste from the cream cheese as well.  I wasn't sure if I was enjoying that part or not.  But I still ate it all up nonetheless!   * Chicken Fried Steak Southern- Style \"U.S.D.A. Certified Choice breaded steak served over our new recipe biscuits and smothered in homemade country gravy.  Served with two extra large eggs and hashbrowns.\" ($10.79) - The Husband is always getting these super fatty dishes and couldn't resist here either.  Although the menu says it served over biscuits, I couldn't really remember if it was and from the picture, I don't see any.  He did get a choice of bread with it and went for the sourdough toast option.  I do want to talk about that sourdough bread - they give out these thick slices of bread and they are yum!    Service - pretty standard service for a busy diner during the weekend brunch rush.  She forgot the tea bag when our friend ordered the tea, but did come around with pots of coffee for refills.  They have seasonal specials to look out for - I think they had pumpkin pancakes on the menu when we went. Keep your eye out for the blackboard when you first walk in.",

The place was pretty full, but we were seated right away. Ordered and got our food fairly quickly. The portions are huge, so we couldn't even finish one order of pancakes. All of the food was great, and we thought so highly of the place that we ate here again on Monday before leaving to go home. I would highly recommend Blueberry Hill for breakfast. I don't know about other meals, but everything looked great on the menu.",

Anyway we settled on the Blueberry Hill Family restaurant based on reviews. We were not disappointed, no wait to get in, the server was prompt with taking the drink order and was not annoyed with us taking a few minutes to look at the menu, it is rather large as it is a 24hr restaurant. I had a waffle with eggs an ham steak. My wife had an omelet with pancakes. The food arrived in a timely fashion and everything was very good. The server came back several times to check on us and was very friendly. Overall a very nice breakfast. I would highly recommend it if you want to dine away from the hustle of the strip.",

Blueberry Hill was better than I thought.  Not knowing what this place was, I just thought it was just another eatery.  After parking the car and entering the establishment, I entered the restaurant and was pleasantly surprised.  We arrived on a Monday at 9am and the place was alive with energy.  Glad I didn't eat breakfast at a major hotel / casino, since they would have been quite pricey.  The neighborhood diner would do just fine, and that is what Blueberry Hill is.    I can compare this place to IHOP or Denny's, but this place is kinda different, but similar in alot of respects.  Its a decent place with nice people, at least when I was there.  I got the corned beef hash with 2 eggs and hasbrowns with sourdough toast.  And coffee.  Pretty tasty for $8. Service was good, although sometimes slow.",

I ordered a platter with sausage, eggs, pancakes, and hashbrowns. I did some substitutions since I am not a fan of bacon and got all sausage instead.

Upon arrival, I was greeted by the Lucky Charms and Care Bear love child on the sign of the Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant sign (go there, you'll see), and was given the heebeegeebees and even more so when walking into a wall of humidity and being taken back to the 80's. Mini-blinds and purple seating; undoubtedly an old-timey diner. Nobody told me about that. Then being face to face with waxed plates of the days specials was a bit stomach turning as it was something I've never seen before. I wanted to turn back and probably just head to the IHOP parallel to the chapel but I remembered to keep an open mind.        Being seated immediately, I was pretty overwhelmed by the menu, in a GOOD way! So many tasty choices. It was 10AM, time for breakfast, maybe some French toast, perhaps a pastrami sandwich? The poor waitress had to come back twice for me to make a decision until I gave into my sweet tooth and got the Oreo Pancakes. No regrets. For a solid price, I got a generous amount of this so called Oreo pancake and boy, was it muy delicioso! Knowing I couldn't stay for lunch, I just had to get the pastrami sandwich to go!        All in all, the food was fantastic and is a must have while at the strip, don't let the atmosphere intimidate you. Service was fast and friendly! Four stars!",

    "text": "Great diner style breakfast place, IHOP wouldn't do phone pick up orders but Blueberry Hill did and saved they day. We had a to-go order for a large party about 12 orders, so it was understandable that we still had to wait a minute for the order even though we called it in.   I do like the variety of menu options, like coconut fried chicken and waffles! That ended up being a good order, the chicken was coated in shredded coconut and fried giving good texture and a light pop of coconut flavor.   The big breakfast burrito was odd though, it was more like a brunch burrito. The inside was breakfast burrito-ey, but outside it was drenched in red sauce like an enchilada?! It also came with beans and rice with some chips. Quite a meal, but not what you would expect.   If you have time do sit-in and enjoy the meal, but for busy people know that you have the option to just get it to-go.",

I had a chicken skillet eggs, chicken, bell peppers,onions, cheese. So good I was full after a few bites. The second time I had fajitas hot & sizzling. I got full after eating only half. You have to eat breakfast or lunch here when you are in Vegas. The price is reasonable. At our first visit service was quick. We were full and sightseeing in no time. Second visit painfully slow, but we will go a third time.",

We then heard another employee complain that they would take care of us. We waited....waited...nothing. Then Adrian asked if she helped us. We said no and he proceeded to take care of us. He is great at what he does and should be acknowledged as so. If not for him, we probably would come back to this location. Thanks Adrian!",

This is one of those places that has all the trimmings and details that make it all work, from friendly staff, great food that is not massed produced and extremely reasonable prices. You can get any plate the way you want it and they make every effort to keep the customers happy which would explain the long line in the mornings. Can't say enough about it except that you need to come try it, experience it and in some cases, cure that Vegas hangover with some great food.",

So I forced myself to be up and ready by 10 and off we went!  We were a party of 8, but it was ok, we didn't have to wait long for a table and service was great!  I ordered some coffee and water to start, needed that to get the brain working, then just for s&g's I checked out their menu, and I almost derailed myself a few times from my order, everything sounded so good!  When it came to my turn to order, I asked for the blueberry pancake stack, minus the blueberry compote, with side of hash browns, oh boy was I in for a treat! The pancakes were better than I even imaged them to be! They were fluffy, packed with nice juicy blueberries on the inside & topped with whipped cream & fresh blueberries on top! DELISH BABY!! Hit it with some syrup and that was sweet bliss! The hash brown they make them fresh and to me they were more like breakfast potatoes and they didn't disappoint!   Breakfast was good, I will come back and have to try out other parts of the menu's everyone ordered a different dish and everything looked great!",

I also saw its first come first serve at the bar so you kinda have to wait right behind people and I don't like doing that.  But the meal was pleasant I got he Irish breakfast eggs bene. Was yummy.

I've been all over the country and this is certifiably delicious, delicious is actually my favorite ingredient and breakfast is too important to not have any delicious in it. This is especially so being that it's in Las Vegas and a good breakfast is key to proper hangover recovery. Do not hesitate in coming here, the menu is huge and the price is not.",

When my family visited Vegas last week, I saw Blueberry Hill's high Yelp rating and knew it must be the place. I was right!   What a welcome break from the strip for us after a few days of casino restaurants! The pancakes were what I remembered. Fluffy, with that very slight crispness on the outside, just perfect. We all enjoyed them!  For some reason, I ordered a mushroom and cheese omelet, and this was the only bad part of the meal. Overall it promised to be an acceptable, not great, dish -- but a few bites in I realized that some of the mushroom pieces were spoiled. I had to spit it out into a napkin -- gross. I was so full from the pancakes by then, that I decided to just leave it be instead of sending it back for something else.  I'd come back here for the pancakes any time I'm in town, but wouldn't stray into the omelet territory next time.",

    "text": "There is something to be said about duplication in the restaurant business.  Some get it right, some can't figure it out.  Blueberry Hill got it right.    They have five locations in the Las Vegas valley (no more anywhere else!) and each has the same down-home, made to order, delicious food with each location having a little different flair to the place.  This one is all about the \"diner\" experience.  This takes you back to the old movie we see where the place has the booths with the upholstery you know your grandmother picked out for wear and durability and not for making any kind of a fashion statement.  But its the food you really come for.  Family style, large portions and freshly made by some people who care about making sure you leave full and wanting to come back.   Or to put it a better way: Comfort Food.  Its served by a staff that is friendly, local and working their tails off to make sure your drinks are filled and your questions answered.   I always recommend t people looking to get off the Vegas Strip and get a good meal for a reasonable price that will fill you up, go here...   Usually, we go here for late night or breakfast.  This time we went for dinner and they did not disappoint.  Me: Taco Salad.  Yes, I ordered a salad.  But with a Taco salad, you usually get a variety of good items mixed into a bowl you can eat.    Here, that's what it was. A very filling and delicious salad with a little bit of everything you expect.  It's not a Navajo Taco that I am used to out on the tours.  But it was very rewarding and you can eat the bowl.  I love that...  The wife:  She was raised Southern, so the \"Down Home Dixie Meatloaf\"  caught her eye.  Especially the line in the description  \"found at a small diner in Kentucky\" .  And they were right. This is a meal you would find only in a small diner int he south or even backwoods Kentucky.  PIled high and covered with thick gravy surrounded by all your fresh vegetables...   In both cases, being the middle of January, we smiled and remarked that yes, the vegetables were indeed crunchy fresh as if they were picked off the vine out back.   This is food and service you do not get anywhere on the Las Vegas Strip, but it is close enough to the Strip for the adventurous tourist to discover and to enjoy while rubbing elbows with the locals!",

When we walked in, there was a mock tray of food in the lobby. It really didn't appeal to me, maybe I watch Gordon Ramsey too much. We just got dessert and coffee. Our server, Lisa, suggested the chocolate cake so we both tried it. It was really moist and flavorful. The frosting was really sweet but the cake is made on premises and really fresh. The coffee was good and our server was great.",

    "text": "We happened to drive by the restaurant the other night on our search for a BofA machine....humm that looks like a good place for breakfast... On our way out of town  just a few days later P suggested we stop in for our pre-road trip breakfast. I-15 on an empty stomach  just isn't safe...right. P ordered Honey Coconut (fried) Chicken and waffles. The denver omelet is my \"standard\" and that was offered but what caught my interest and appetite was the Wild West omelet, I wasn't disappointed. They start with four extra large eggs, basically unheard of in most breakfast joints. Then added a STon of diced ham, bacon, and sausage plus onions peppers, cheese. Too big to fold it covered my 8\" plate. I paid extra for fresh fruit on the side, fresh cut cantaloupe, grapes and banana slices. I asked for a cup of salsa to wash down that omelette, it too was as fresh as you could want, tasty and slightly on the hotter side...perfect. As I figured P couldn't finish her chicken and waffles and in the honor of transparency I was obligated to try them for myself. Even a bit on the cold side I was not disappointed with the chicken and waffles. I first noticed was that the waffles were very light in texture. The white meat chicken cut into four triangles, breaded and fried perfectly and juicy too. The syrup (usually why I avoid pancakes and such) was very good with a back taste of ms butterworths, defiantly not the typical flavored corn syrup. The rest was history, coffee hot and quickly refilled. Service was kind and patient, we enjoyed the experience and the meal. We'll be back when we're in town. Foodguy-Martin",

My first time here I had a great experience, and then something happened and their food and service just went downhill, and then now we gave them one last chance and I must say I had to update my review and give them more stars. We were in town for EDC this time and stopped here for brunch because it was close to our vacation rental and they have a little bit of everything on their menu. You can have breakfast food, lunch food, or dinner items.   We ordered pancakes, their tuna sandwich, and an egg omelette. Their portions are very generous for what their cost and the quality of the food was a HUGE step up from what we were given during our last visit. This is a faimily style diner so dont come expecting Vegas Strip style 5 star restaurant quality food, BUT its definitely good food for a good price and they're open 24 hours. Our pancakes were hot, fluffy, and big. The Tuna Salad in the sandwich was very good, freshly prepared, and the tuna itself was fresh and very good. The egg omelette was very big and delicious. We definitely had leftovers and enjoyed the rest of our meals again later.  Their service was great. We came in at a pretty busy time and got seated right away and received good seevice by staff the entire time. I'll probably come back here again next time im in town because they have redeemed themselves in my book!",

Hubby ended up ordering an apple cinnamon  Waffle (even though the pancakes WERE an option). I ordered a Denver omelette with a side biscuit with gravy.   All the food was literally the best breakfast food you can imagine. Portion sizes should be shared. All five of us had to-go boxes when we left.    The service was fast and friendly. Coffee was hot, strong, and refilled quickly.   We hit up Vegas a couple of times a year, and I'm looking forward to coming back (if only for the biscuits and gravy)",

Especially for those who really can't decide, BH's  menu  has pretty much anything you want. Personally I think they ought to cut  it down  by half and just do those dishes really well,instead you get  OK and pretty good food along the lines of Denny's or slightly below. The fruit pancakes are good, crepes so so, eggs benny  Ok  but  my whites  were really runny,  not cool. Service is good prompt & efficient, food arrives in minutes- endless coffee. It is diner coffee, so don't get too excited. Prices very reasonable, average plate is $ 10- 12.  All in all very good,  but not great breakfast place.",

I usually get the breaded pork chop dinner which is my favorite.  I ventured to the pasta section and that spaghetti and meatballs were calling my name.   I ended up with the italian meatloaf because it came with Spaghetti!  for just $3 and some change you can add a drink, Soup or Salad, and dessert.  Hell yeah!!   The dish was Plentiful.  The Spaghetti was excellent.  The meatlof was really good but I didn't care for the sweetness of the marinara sauce they put on the meatloaf.   For dessert I the Reeses pieces Cheese cake.

Their portions are out of this world. My go to item is the chorizo omelette. It's humongous as it's made with 4 large eggs, and it comes with a side of Spanish rice, beans, home-made salsa, and a side of tortilla. They also have the best blueberry pancakes (hence the name blueberry hill) in the game. They're so soft and fluffy!   Service is quick, pleasant, and accommodating.

From now on I will continue to come every time I'm in town. I love their variety. They have American, Mexican, Italian and more. I love their Breakfast and Mexican food. The in both occasions were less than 3 minutes, the host is warm, and the servers are the best. They are so sweet and bilingual. Today I brought four of my In-laws and they loved it. We all got different food and everyone loved it. I loved how the servers was able to communicate with them in Spanish they felt at home. Every time I come I will be bringing family and friends. There food, atmosphere, service, prices are amazing. There prices, food, and service are better than any popular chain alike. I love Blueberry Hill Restaurant",

The Hill Is best known for they're breakfast but It has a large menu for lunch and dinner. The servers are sweet and they are very attentive when It comes to coffee refills.   My fave is the Corned Beef with 2 eggs which comes with your choice of hush browns or pancakes and toast.",

My wife and I came into place an order to go and was informed that they DO NOT allow to go orders from the children's menu. I have eaten at restaurants all over the country and found this policy to be very strange. So, a family wants to come here and order food to go, but the kids have to eat adult plates? Also, you must give your credit number, expiration date, name, and zip code. Other than that, the food is always great.",

    "text": "Nothing is better than breakfast after a night of club/bar hopping and drinking. Blueberry Hill has everything to suit whichever mood you are in. There is no need to settle on eggs if the craving for a burger is present. This allows for less bickering with your friends and more time to nurse that impending hangover.  Tonight, my friend and I shared an Alaskan Waffle with Apple Compote. The crispy yet fluffy waffle was layered with a thick serving of vanilla ice cream, heaps of warm apple pie filling, and a mound of whip cream. The hot waffle started to melt the ice cream, creating a wonderful sauce.   This monster is definitely something to share. At a little over $9, it can easily feed two while leaving you feel comatose.   Being so close to the university, this is definitely an old haunt that reminds me of many a drunken nights. The wait staff here know how to deal with this crowd of younger party goers.",

Their menu has a fairly decent amount of variety when it comes to combination plates and different meals to choose from whether it's breakfast, lunch, or even something you would consider as dinner.  Our server was friendly and prompt with our meal, and I ended up having the veggie omlette substituted with egg whites instead. DELICIOUS! It was so filling I couldn't finish the entire portion, their portions in general are plenty and you definitely get good side items of toast or hash browns. Blueberry Hill has always been an A-OK place for me to go to when craving breakfast items instead of IHOP.",

Salsa had a nice zing and better than i thought.  Rice was like out of a box and the beans were like out of a can. Flavors were ok.  I had some of my friends rocky road pancakes and it was decent.  Good flavor but texture was lacking.  Overall ok visit but I think there are better breakfast places in Vegas to choose from.",

We were looking for a diner or family-style restaurant to get a full, filling breakfast before the craziness of the weekend.   The place was packed & the parking lot too - must be a sign the food is awesome.  Despite the amount of people, we easily found a parking spot in the extra large attached lot & we were quickly seated inside.  They have fresh baked muffins and the blueberry one was huge and amaaaaaaaazing.  It came out hot & with a dish of whipped butter.  My mom and I made a meal of that before our actual breakfast plates came out.  We saw a ton of huge (we're talking 2\" thick) pancakes floating by to other tables and if we ever come back, we are totally getting them.  They also have really large cakes up front...at least 6\" tall!    Plenty of booths & tables + counter seating.    Come here hungry!",

A not too long line of people waiting for a table (a great sign as far as I am concerned).  Soooo...  I grabbed a seat at the counter right away. A few dirty dishes still present, but no prob. My server cleared them away at the same time as asking my beverage order. All good.  I ordered bacon and eggs with some pancakes on the side.  Eggs scrambled just right (NOT whipped all yellow) and bacon. Bacon was a bit thin, but all and all good.  The pancakes you ask? GET THE PANCAKES! Fluffy battery buttery syrupy goodness!  Service was nice and smiley with promptness thrown in.  To heck with all the kitschyness and long line at the Peppermill, (especially on a weekend!) I am coming here instead! Oh... Next trip here, I will be trying one of the three layer cakes I was staring at. Hmmm... Maybe later today!",

Bring your appetite, and don't order too much food, because the portion sizes are no joke, they don't mess around , they are for realz at the BbHFR.   I customized the hell out of my order, which was met with open ears and a ready pen. The food was yummy, the coffee was strong and the service was delightful.   Ordered - Chocolate Chip pancakes, next time will order just one. Also had the coconut honey chicken tender things, without the waffle, and enjoyed that. Had a side of bacon (I'm beginning to feel insecure about the amount of food I ate) and some toast...(cuz yeah I needed the carbs, not really).   I bet the prices are good here, I don't know really because I don't understand money all that well. I just charge things to my card and then Obama pays my card off. So yeah, you'll have to decide for yourself on that one.   The location is conveniently close to the strip and the dwelling of this girl I like. Double convenience for me! Yay.

Once we were seated we took a look at the menu and took about 20 minutes to decide what we wanted. It took forever for us to actually get our food, and our waiter never checked back up on us once we ordered. It wasn't until my food arrived at my table that I got a refill on my drink.

The hash browns weren't that hot and needed some more salt and pepper. The toast was over cooked.  Once the desert came (included in special) it was a Blueberry muffin that appeared to be a little over cooked and contained like 5 blueberries.

There are several locations in town, but they all have a very Mom & Pop greasy spoon feel to them as if they were all independently owned and operated.    For our first visit to this location, we tried out the  - Chicken Fried Steak & Eggs with buttermilk pancakes and Blueberry Compote - Chicken Fried Chicken & Eggs with Buttermilk pancakes.  I've gotta tell ya, they have some of the best chicken fried ____  that I've ever tried.  They use actual Steaks for the fried steak and not ground beef.  Both the steakand the chicken were tender and juicy,while the breading was light and crisp, not grease-soaked.  The Pancakes were good and the blueberry compote was not overly sweet like I've had at other diners.  Unfortunately, on this visit, the service wasn't all that friendly, they get a temporary ding for that pending a second visit.  So, for now, 4 stars for the food with a temporary -.5 for the service.",

    "text": "So after leaving the Bellagio with my sister our newly pedicured toes, the boy decided he was hungry and needed to eat something.  We asked my sister to suggest something \"diner-y, but not Denny's or IHOP.\"  We ended up at Blueberry Hill.  There was a short wait for a table, but not too bad for a Sunday morning.  Our waitress was nice, but had a beer gut and looked like she hadn't showered recently.  The restaurant had a desert motif, which I thought was kind of strange.  I mean, sure, we're in the desert but the last thing I equate with the desert is blueberries.  Blueberries grow in cool moist places.  Not in places where your flesh will boil right off your body if you stand in the sun too long.  Anyway.  The bathroom was a little run down but still use-able.  Mixed reviews on the food.  My hash browns tasted sort of undercooked.  But the pancakes were phenomenally good.  I was mad that I didn't order them, and the boy probably was too since I kept stealing bites of his.  I would probably come back here again (for the pancakes if nothing else).  You know, it's diner-y, but not Denny's or IHOP.",

If not all people in your party are present, he will not seat you until everyone has arrived because, in his words, you are taking up valuable space!!!  At the time, it was just my husband and I and we were waiting for our son and his fiance to arrive.  We waited 15 minutes, while other people were being seated two to a booth, ahead of us.  When I questioned the manager about this, he became upset and said we were welcome to leave and find another restaurant!!!  Food portions and prices were good.  Bathrooms were filthy.  We opted to go up the street to the Blueberry Hill at 3790 E. Flamingo Rd. and were seated promptly, food service was good and friendly.  Portions were great.",

We actually sought out this place by searching for chilaquiles in Vegas on Yelp!  Why?  Because I had a craving, that's why.  Therefore, I perused the menu merely as a formality before ordering up the Chilaquiles, Mexican-Style.  Luckily, I was not disappointed.  Check out my pics for the hefty portions of tortillas, eggs and ranchero sauce complemented with a small salad and perfectly roasted jalapeno.  All cooked to perfection.  F**k yeah I'll be back!",

It's Jan. 2, 2009 and I'm picking up my friend for breakfast before taking her to the airport for her flight back to SF.  Then I gotta head to work for an assuredly boring day.  But who cares about all that because there's nothing like a four egg omelet with ham and bacon (Texas Omelet) to get your day started.  Let's not forget the mound of hash browns and side of toast with jelly to complete the oh so satisfying meal.  Oh, and the portions were made for people who enjoy eating!    Although I'm not much of a pancake fan, I really, really enjoy breakfast food.  My friend did order the fresh blueberry pancakes after a couple of minutes of tortured decision making between blueberries or strawberries.  At first I thought it odd that her meal consisted of just the pancakes and nothing more.  Then I saw the pancakes and it all made sense.  4 large fluffy blueberry gooey pancakes was more than enough.  There was no way she was taking that home with her so she gave me 2 and all I gotta say is Mmmmmm Mmmm!  Hmmmm... dang.  I just made myself hungry and Blueberry Hill sounds really good right now.",

Everything is so yummy, and I always eat way too much and then feel sick. But in a good way. This is the way a diner is supposed to be. The coffee is strong. The waitresses are career, and have been working here forever. The only thing I see as a negative is the bathroom. I feel dirty after I go in there, so only 4 stars (for now!)",

Their prices are ao much more reasonable than restaurants on the strip. They have daily dinner specials that come with sohp or salad and dessert. By the way...the split pea soup is AMAZING and the homemade cheesecake is so super yummy!  Sure Vegas haz glitzzy places to eat but that will certainly break your bank. If you have a car with you in Vegas it is worth your time to go here to save some money and get some mighty tasty food. We even went back for breakfast and the crepes were perfect. If you are in Vegas with your kids this is a definate must. They actually have a kids menu when many strip restaurants do not. They even have. 99 cent kids meals before 6 pm during the week. So worth it when with kids. Eating on strip with your kids is a money killer. This is my new eat in joint while in Vegas!",

    "text": "Had dinner here last night.  Was my first time at his place.  Hostess was chewing gum and texting on her cell phone and told me to sit anywhere I wanted. I picked a table and sat there for over 5 minutes before a server noticed I was seated.  Several of he employees were sitting at the counter (in uniform) eating and on their cell phones.  Maybe management needs to teach the employees to use  the break room and not be eating in the dining room.  I ordered the turkey dinner.   Mashed potatoes and gravy were stone cold.  My server never came back to check on me or offer drink refills.  I had to ask the hostess to get my bill.  This was a very disappointing experience. This isn't a 5 star restaurant but come guys, at least pay attention to your customers and do your job instead of sitting at the counter.  Sadly to say, Blueberry Hill staff is unprofessional and rude.  I won't be able at this place.  I can spend my money elsewhere and get much better service.",

I have been many times, and never disapointed. Great hot and fresh food, and plenty of it. Service has been great for me, and they get you seated fairly quickly when there is a wait. The best part is that everytime I went, I was full, and it didn't cost me $12-$24 like the buffet does. So if you are in the mood for a great breakfast after a night in Vegas GO Here it is worth it. In my opinion it is the best breakfast in Vegas. I have not had lunch or dinner here so can't comment on them.",

I had the guadalajara skillet, chorizo, cheese, onions, bell peppers, hash browns and tortilla chips.  It came with an excellent hot sauce, the menu should warn though that this dish is spicy, its got major kick.  The hubby had the blueberry pancake bfast that came with two honkin pancakes that had blueberry in the batter and on top.  I also enjoyed the coffee.  I do recommend this place, you will need a car or taxi to get there.  They are open 24 hours so you can get your grub on at any time.  Oh and don't let the horn scare you, I guess its played every hour so the employees remember to wash their hands!?!  I must also go back and try the homemade cakes on display, there were at least 6 in the case!",

I had to flag her down for a second cup of coffee as I watched her combined other pots of coffee into one to refill my cup.

It is also open 24 hours, so if you have any midnight muchies, i recommend trying this place out. The pancakes are delectable, and I truly believe this place is 100 times better than Dennys and IHOP combined. If you are really hungry try the chicken fried steak and a side of pancakes, yes a SIDE of pancakes. If you just want pancakes, order any of the pancake specials or any omelette with a side of pancakes!  I absolutely love this location because of the ambiance.   The service is top-shelf!! I have never had any bad experience with any waiter, and believe me, they know the menu in and out. They are very friendly and make feel welcomed. Nothing bad to say about the service, theyre just pretty damn good at it.  Ambiance is very casual, especially at night (when no one is there).  Again, I never had a bad experience at any of these restaurants and I stick to my opinion!",

My wife and I shared the coconut honey chicken and waffle and my daughter had the 3 crepe meal with blueberry compote.  The honey butter that comes with the chicken and waffles is so good that syrup isnt even needed. In fact it might detract from the brilliant flavor they have on their own.  My daughter loved the crepes and I basically stole one off her plate.   The relatively low amount of food we ordered was plenty to keep us full all day long. This is a must stop for basically anything you'd like to eat.",

    "text": "REVIEW #1,000 - Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant deserves this spot!  After an early morning phone message from our hotel trying to sell us spa services, we were out of bed and ready to get out of that casino once we were done at their gym. We stopped at Chase to get some cash, and only then realized it was getting late and we hadn't eaten yet. Blueberry was visible from the bank's location so we excitedly headed there. As we walked in, the hungry husband and myself were happy to see it wasn't packed, but wasn't empty either.  I ordered two eggs, hashbrowns and sourdough, with a side of the hot house salsa and a roasted jalapeno. (I had seen one in the menu pictures and had to have it.) It didn't take long for the hot food to arrive and our waitress told me they'd roasted 2 jalapenos for me! Yumm. These were no ordinary jalapenos. I don't know how they found huge, gigantic jalapenos, but they were awesome. Really hot, too!    Everything on the plate was yummy. My hashbrowns were cooked crispy and the sourdough was decent (it's hard to judge sourdough outside of the Bay Area because we really have the best stuff there!) The salsa was so good too! I could only eat one of the oversized jalapenos but our nice waitress brought me some Saran Wrap so that I could take the other one with me.   Service was great. Our server was attentive and friendly. I wish I knew her name, but the receipt only says \"Server #8\" 1/29/14 12:59 p.m.  People like her are the reason we enjoy going out to eat so often.  ($20.71 total for our breakfast.)",

After I received my water, the glass had residue from coca cola still stuck to the inside of the glass. Appetizers came out with the food instead of before. Breakfast Bacon was floppy, extremely undercooked. When I sent it back to the kitchen less than a minute later the bacon came out again, more cooked however unless they had 3 identical pieces of bacon already cooking in the kitchen, they just threw the bacon in the microwave to cook more, or they have bacon sitting under a heat lamp. My table ordered a grilled cheese with bacon. Got back a single piece of melted cheese with a pile of undercooked bacon shoved between two slices of bread. Ordered French toast. The toast was sogged all the way through with batter and completely undercooked. Some of the food was OK, nothing spectacular. To say the least, this restaurant doesn't deserve the title of best coffee house/diner from the Las Vegas Review Journal.",

I went in around 5:30 in the evening and the restaurant was basically empty.  That should have been my first clue.  I ordered a meatball sandwich with fries and a dinner salad.  The salad came out first and was nothing special.  I had Italian dressing and it was far to oily.  Hardly any vinegar to speak of.  It left a weird coating in my mouth that was rather unpleasent.  But I ate it because I don't like wasting food.  My meatball sandwich and fries came out looking impressive but was a bit underwhelming when I ate it.  Sure, there were a lot pf big meatballs on a nice sized roll.  And there was just the right amount of sauce.  Meat sauce to be precise.  No shortage of meat here.  The issue I had with this sandwich is that it wasn't hot.  Just luke warm.  The cheese had already coagulated.  How long was this thing under the heat lamp?  At least the fries were good.  Though after eating the oily salad and the luke warm sandwich I was too full to eat all of my fries.  I guess that is a mark in the win column.  I was full.",

Fortunately, the Blueberry Hill is a good restaurant. I had their chicken special, which was sliced chicken breast on a bed of noodles, with some mixed vegetables. It was pretty average, but good quantity. I wondered if the place was popular with people who got liquored up.   Then I tried their carrot cake. While I love carrot cake, this carrot cake was superb. It was frosted so well; not with a big thick layer of frosting but nicely frosted so it wouldn't kill the taste of the cake itself. The cake was well textured and moist. I wanted to have some ice cream with it, but I think I would have been carried out of the place.  Our waitress was attentive and provided us the food on time; meaning hot.  If you're on a budget, want good food, especially breakfast like pancakes and French toast, I believe Blueberry Hill is a nice option.",

They just lost a party of 4 because she was so busy ( lots of empty tables by the way)",

    "text": "Tried Blueberry Hill Sunday morning in Las Vegas. The outside was not that appealing compared to the flashy look of the strip only a few blocks away, it looked very country oakie. Inside, the staff was nice, the restroom needed a little tlc, and the booths were comfy (though I'm short and my feet barely touched the floor). As a group of 6, they sat us quickly, and the food came out decently quick. Everyone loved their food. Perfect for a hangover, or a desire for a home country meal. I got the biscuits and gravy, just 1 was a lot; and bacon. The biscuit was 3 something and the bacon side was over $4 (read wtf?) They need to work on their pricing. One girl got 2 biscuits,  sausage, 2 eggs, and cheese sticks.  Her bill was $24. Everything was individually charged; and the way it was set up on the menu, confusing.   For everyone else, it was a good experience.",

My lovely wife and I went to the Bellagio for some later night Christmas entertainment (the Garden Conservatory and Fountain show), and stopped here on the way back home for a quick bite to eat.    Our waitress was FANTASTIC.  She was perfectly attentive, and very warm & friendly, especially since she had to work on Christmas night!  WELL DONE!    The food was delicious, and the bill fit our budget nicely.  A HUGE PLUS is that this location is open 24 hours--surprisingly for a town like Las Vegas, not all Blueberry Hill locations are open all night!  For a quick, delicious bite off-Strip and away from the hustle and bustle of tourists, come here.  You'll find mostly locals who aren't impressed with noisy drunkards and gluttons looking for the cheapest buffet.  There's lots of free parking, too.    To maybe even come close to a 5-star rating: 1. The facilities could use a remodel.  Nothing too crazy and huge, but just enough to distinguish this place from Denny's or IHOP.   2. Serve Coca-Cola products.  I prefer Coke over Pepsi, and I know that's a personal preference, but having both options really rocks for everyone who drinks soda!   3. Some of the products are on the cheap side.  (The shredded cheddar cheese is OBVIOUSLY processed cheese, and tastes like powdery American cheese.)  I know that the ingredients need to be cheaper to keep costs down, but hey, that's one thing that separates 4-star and 5-star establishments in my book.",

There was a ton of people waiting for tables when we got there. We were a party of 3. The wait went by super fast. We waited no more than 15 minutes. The waitress, in my opinion, seemed very dry and rushed. Not at all friendly. Mind you this was my first time at Blueberry Hill. I have heard good things about this restaurant. The menu had many good options. I was looking for meatless breakfast platters as I'm a vegetarian. I ordered french toast with a side of hashbrown and eggs. My son had cinnamon pancakes with a side of sausage and egg. My French toast was good nothing extraordinary. The eggs were okay. My hashbrown was very dry and somewhat burnt. My son's pancakes were huggge. He couldn't even finish half of them. He didn't care much for the sausage but said the eggs were okay. To be honest I was disappointed with my meal. I expected more. The food was very commercial. I would probably come back here at least I know what to expect now. Not anytime soon though.",

At the entrance of this restaurant, there is an aqua blue wooden bench, with a cartoon inspired image of pueblos, rocky mountains and cactuses. I think it's rather clever they did that, it's a creative tactic for a comical photo opp. The server that took our order is Sally, she's polite and attentive. Initially I wanted to try the Coconut Honey Chicken Waffle, but it wasn't available at the time. So I chose Chicken Fried Steak, which comes with their homemade biscuit, country gravy, veggies, and is usually served with mashed potatoes. Since they were out of mashed potatoes, Sally offered if I'd be okay with curly fries instead. I said Yes! And I am so thankful. I like the comfort food of chicken, biscuit, gravy and fries. They do give a generous portion. It's enough to share a meal and still bring home leftovers.",

So after attending the Elton John Million-Dollar Piano show, my family was looking for some comfort food.  Wow!, Did we ever find the place!  It was not that crowded at 11 PM (Open 24) on January 1st.  When I picked up the menu, I didn't expect it to be as thick as Melville's Moby Dick, but it was!  This may be the most extensive menu that I have ever seen.  I talked my wife out of the spaghetti, b/c it just didn't seem like an Italian place...but trust me, they even have a page or two of Italian specialties.  My son had a Chicken and Apple Compote Waffle dish, while I had the Meatloaf with sausage gravy with bacon on a biscuit....CULINARY GENIUS.  We did not have room for desert, but the pies and baked goods looked amazing.  This could be the best diner in LV, I know that I am not looking any further!",

Their food is consistently decent, service is always good, but the restaurant itself needs some SERIOUS TLC! While I realize that this location has been around for a while (check the 90s southwestern decor), everything looks very shop worn and dingy. While I'm okay with old spaces, simple things like a new coat of paint would do wonders for that old, beat up beadboard! What really bothers me is the general lack of housekeeping. You can see the collected dust in the lighting grates, on the glass pendant light shades over the tables and the air ducts. The glass/plexi booth dividers have dried stuff on them and in general, it is not clean in the way one would expect for a restaurant.  And while I realize that it will never be 100% clean all the time, the dust bunnies themselves illustrate that general cleaning procedures are not being used.  While this has been our go to breakfast/late night spot due to the menu variety and location, we will be finding a new spot cause I don't love dust bunnies and who knows what else floating around my food.",

I was pleasantly surprised how clean it was in there versus what I was picturing because of the side of town it is at. We were immediately greeted by a genuinely friendly waitress (wish I got her name) then seated. All the menus and specials are already on the table for you to dive into.  They have a large menu...I mean, it's pretty extensive. If you know what you want, stick to it...once you start flipping through those pages persuasion kicks in resulting in indecisiveness. Well, that's what happen to me. Out of everything on that dang novel I opted for a chicken Caesar wrap. Surprise-Surprise! I was just torn because by this time it's nearly 130 in the morning and I didn't want to eat anything seriously that early/late. The wrap itself twas pretty decent. I had no idea they put onions in theirs. Felt a little bummed to bite into my wrap with the taste of onions (love onions just not in my Caesar anything).  The husband ordered their honey coconut chicken and waffles. He saw the words honey and coconut--done. He enjoyed it as the boneless chicken was moist.   The mother ordered...I wasn't paying attention. Lol. But I did see some kielbasa like sausages on her plate, toast, eggs, and hash browns. The hash browns were probably a little.on the crappy side. But I say that because I like my hash brown to have a crispy top. Geez, I must've paid alot more attention to it that I originally thought.  Overall, I was impressed at the service, facility, and the food. I guess I had pretty low expectations. The service was definitely exceptional. Our waitress wasn't acting sluggish or giving you that geez I just wanna sleep body language. She clearly had her cup of coffee and genuinely felt happy to be at work. Not a common vibe you get from workers out in the valley.   If you want something waaaay better than a Dennys or an Ihop, this place is certainly the spot to give a try.  Definitely kid and stroller friendly!",

Side of fruit was very fresh and delicious. You can also get housemade salsa & cholula with your eggs if you'd like. I'd give it 5 star, but it's very noisy & busy. Better if you order on menu without changes. Serving sizes are generous. Pork sausage is links and not fatty at all. Very tasty.  I would definitely recommend this place for good breakfast.",

    "text": "Great home cooked food at a good price!  We were pleasantly pleased to find some hidden treasures in this voluminous menu.  Truly, if you can't find something to eat here, you aren't looking.  Some great notes...pancakes are huge and well dressed for the affair.  We ordered chocolate Oreo pancakes and the blueberry pancakes.  Both over the top delicious.  Blueberry pancakes had a warm compite of blueberries and whipped butter.  The Orea pancakes were loaded with Oreo chunks and dressed with icing and whipped butter.  Super delicious and served with warm syrup.  Love that little touch!!  I ordered the steak and eggs and it did not disappoint.  Perfect crossed grill marks and eggs were a perfect over easy.  I always ask for my hash browns well done and most of the time other restaurants can't figure it out.  This place got it and my hash browns were perfection.  My husband ordered the chicken fried steak and our other friend ordered the bacon omelet.  Both substantial.  Gravy is scratch and perfect accompaniment to their biscuits.  I really can't say enough!  Service was great, never had to want for more coffee or refills.  Please go and check it out!  This place has been in business a long time and you can tell why!  Service and quality were on point!   My tip:  try a bunch of stuff...take friends that are willing to order and share donyou can enjoy much. Variety...otherwise portion sizes make trying other things without sharing is a bit prohibitive!",

When my friend made the suggestion, I was skeptical...but I am so glad I went with it. I would completely bore you with additional facts so I will repeat: the breakfast was amazing!!! I loved every moment of the experience. So much so that I returned for a second time during the same week.",

That was good since it was busy and the man seating people seemed a little nonchalant and not in any hurry.  We were helped quickly at the counter.  I had already decided to order the honey coconut chicken and waffles.  My husband decided to order the mini omelette special that was on the board when we walked in.  As we sat at the counter, we got to see the servers make toast and get drinks.  I was impressed by their sanitary food handling.  The food came pretty quickly despite how busy they were.  My honey coconut chicken and waffles were delicious.  The chicken was crispy and the waffles were perfect.  I liked the honey drizzled all over the chicken and the waffles.  I only needed a touch of maple syrup with the honey.  My husband's mini omelette was not mini at all.  It was just right and big enough.   Service was great.  I would like to come back and try their lunch or dinner next time.",

But back to our breakfast. I got the taco breakfast which was 3 flour tortillas with a taco meat scramble , lettuce , tomato, a Spanish rice n refried beans. The taco meat was very dry and lacked flavor. The rice is probably Sysco as I saw the truck outside, that's what hit reminds me of. You could literally add cubed chicken to it with some egg and you have chicken fried rice. My boyfriend had the rib eye steak breakfast for 13.99. He said it was very grisely and chewy and greasy. Hash browns were good his over easy eggs were a little over cooked..  When you look at the menu, this restaurant offers WAY TOO MANY options. They are trying to cover every imaginable food style here. It would be better to have a streamlined menu and focus on perfecting the flavor and consistency.  Out of our 4 days visiting Vegas, this was not one of our favorites .Service was good. The cashier didnt ask how our meal was or say thank you.. I think that's important to close out a visit",

I enjoyed the corn beef hash skillet which was very delightful and had the right amount of potatoes and corned beef. Very tasty and not too salty like more places that serve this dish.

    "text": "We had a bad vibe from this laundry shop late at night so we decided to take a Lyft and go to a 24hr cafe that's just couple of minutes away. Mostly are already close since it's already 1am and some open Cafe are just drive thru or will be close in few minutes before we even arrive.  They had a 4 stars by the time I checked this place so we gave it a shot and reading the reviews we thought it's going to be a nice place to sit and dine for awhile.  We came and few people we're dinning in. Since it says \"No waiting\" we decided to sit for the first time in the counter and see what the hype is all about!  We got there and waited for a 2 minutes, suddenly old lady came in and said she'll be right back  since they're 4 people behind. Then suddenly 2 ladies came out from they're table and said that they would just cancel their order (I assume they've been waiting for awhile)  So the lady came back to us asking for the order (by the way we just grab the menu by ourselves since its takes awhile for them to serve us, they could've just hand us out the menu instead of coming to us and saying they're 4 people short but i still appreciate that fact that she mentioned it to us.  Since we felt like they're just 3 of them and it orders might take awhile to come out, we just ordered coffee. Without asking us what kind (menu says 3 kinds, coffee with meal, ala carte, to go) she serve us the coffee (my own coffee made is way better lol) So from then i started looking around to see interesting spots and nah! NADA! Only interesting part is the dirty spots in the kitchen counter i could say a lil nasty since I'm expecting a well clean dining that offers 24 hours, so I feel like since it's a 24 hr restau they should be meeting your expectation for good service and cleanliness.  So nope! I won't be coming back",

We (tourists) don't get stuck eating at some grossly over-priced cafe in an equally overpriced casino, or some Denny's or Ihop that builds near the strip. The menu is so extensive that I forced myself to set it down after reading just the breakfast items.  Reasonable prices, good coffee, good service, blah blah blah...   This place is all about awesome food. Cinnamon (roll) Pancakes, Chicken and Waffles with or without fruit, Ham Steak and Eggs, Breaded Meat Loaf and Eggs. I could go on but the best thing I can say is just go eat there. We ended up there both mornings of our 2 day trip.   I encourage Blueberry Hill to consider a few locations in Reno.",

We got a sampling of normal breakfast dishes and sides, and were satisfied with them, but it was rather mediocre faire that I can honestly take or leave.  Take the biscuits and gravy, for instance.  The \"biscuits\" are gigantic, rectangular cakes of some sort of cooked and possibly also pan-fried not-quite-biscuit dough.  The sausage gravy was decent, but a lot of milk and flour and thin on the sausage.  This is pretty nominal example of such a dish compared to what one can cook at home in ten minutes, and the potatoes, pancakes, omelets, and other dishes we had were similarly okay-but-not-that-great.",

BBHFR was in the immediate area and all the other BB Hills are always a solid eat spot.  The parking lot was packed (lot's of out of town plates) and I thought we might be in for a wait.  While this was sort of the case, the two of us waited for about eight minutes and then we had a table.  The place was slammed and I was not expecting much from the waitress but she took our orders quickly and did the best to keep up with keeping the coffee hot.  My Grubsteaker breakfast was great!  A slab of ground beef covered with cheese and bacon, served with two eggs and hash browns.  This particular BBH offers great service, great food for those that live in the area and for those looking to make the long trek across the desert.",

My favorite is the Mexican Scramble with eggs over-easy.  Coffee is very good (even though the mugs are tiny).  Prices are very reasonable.  Open 24 hours.  Wear some loose fitting clothes because YOU WILL GET FULL!  Why 4 stars instead of 5? Only because the place looks a bit dirty.  Your first time there, you may be put off by the appearance of the place, but once you sink your teeth into the chocolate chip pancakes, you won't remember.  And you'll be back. I go here every-time I'm in LV and I'm in LV several times a year.",

    "text": "Found this diner while driving around Las Vegas. Looked up the reviews on yelp and decided to go in. This was our third trip to Vegas and the more I go, the less I want to eat at a casino. The casino buffets are convenient but I always feel I just paid 25.99$ to eat at Old Country Buffet!   Ate breakfast two mornings in a row. This place is open 24/7 and you can get any item at any time. First morning I had the Chicken Waffles, West Coast style, it's a big home made waffle with home made chicken fingers put on top of it with yummy salted butter scooped into it and you just pour the syrup over ever thing. Sweet and salty, very good! I was with friends and there was an order of steak and eggs with pancakes at our table. Their pancakes are amazing. Big, light, and fluffy  with big scoops of the salted butter... UMMMMM food coma! Oh yes and not to be forgotten coffee was excellent and service was amazing. Waitress was happy to serve us, and was always refilling coffee and water glasses.   Second morning.... I wasn't in the mood for breakfast, we were getting ready to leave Las Vegas via car to Los Angeles and I didn't want anything too sweet. So I had the bacon cheese burger and fries.... excellent! Friends had the chorizo omelet and the other one had the french toast. I had thought their best plate was pancakes... I was wrong, the french toast was even better. Everything was perfect, right amount of being cooked, not soggy, not squished, not hard, cinnamon and powered sugar and then the salted butter on top.... it was the best french toast I've ever eaten.    We will be back to Vegas at the end of our road trip and we plan on going back. The waitresses and the manager (or owner?) spent time talking to us and made us feel welcomed.  This is absolutely a don't miss when you are in Vegas.",

    "text": "This review is for the Blueberry Hill Restaurant located next to the library on Flamingo. A group of seven of us had just got done bowling at Sam's Town and were looking to get our \"after drinking grub\" on. It was around 1am when we sat and began our wait....and I mean WAIT!!! We starting timing the waitress on our phones to see how long it was going to take her to get our order...10 minutes and a solid minute before we were going to leave. After that we waited another 10 minutes to actually get the drinks we ordered, well some of us that is. Me and two other friends ordered coffee and after waiting twenty minutes to see her start to walk over with it we all realized there was not enough in the pot for all of us. So my friend waited another 10 minutes before he actually got his coffee. My friend and I that did get coffee originally were already done with our coffee when he finally got some....uuggghhh!! Our friends that ordered soda both complained that something didn't taste right and switched too water. AND that was just the drinks:(   Now the food is the only part of this review that i gave stars to. Not for it's promptness or fantastical value because it had neither but for the fact that it was hot and filled up my alcohol laden belly as wished. It was good....when we finally got it:(   To set things into perspective...when we got there another large group of six sat down at the same time as us. When we were sitting there wondering if we would ever get our food or coffee for the lone one of  us that still hadn't gotten any they were gone and fed!!!! What a crappy experience at a normally very good place...disappointed that i brought my friends there for their first time and our waitress sucked!!! Must have had something to do with the 18% tip she tacked on our bill:{",

First we were kept waiting 15 minutes after getting to the front of the line because the  needlessly overwhelmed older latin employee wanted to wait for a bigger table for our party of 7.  Instead of putting us in 2 tables of 4 as we had asked for he ignored me and continued to make us wait while he sat 5 more tables of 4 that should have been for us. The larger table was only for 6 so we had to pull up a chair and were so horribly cramped there wasn't room for the food.  After giving up we had to ask for coffee, had no setups from our younger hispanic waitress who seemed like it was her 1st day ever. Our service took forever and we had to actually flag down our waitress if we needed anything because she never asked us. When I tried to wash my hands there was no soap or towels but no one seemed to care when I told them. My days of recommending and raving about the food are over. The rude and most horrible service ever just not worth it.",

It has the same overused, undercleaned feeling of IHOP but without the swing-and-a-miss decor attempt.   The service was friendly, if not accurate nor timely.   The \"homemade\" blueberry muffin tasted as if it was a mixture of Krusteaz and cement. I ate two bites of that brick twelve hours ago and I've had the displeasure of constant \"reminders\" of its taste every few minutes since then.  I ordered The Alamo which was three small breakfast burritos that managed to rank below McDonald's similarly plasticine product in taste and texture. The beans that came with it were a brownish-gray paste that I have to admit I didn't have the courage to consume.  My friend ordered eggs and hash browns and was pleased. But then, she's not writing this review. This was, by far, the worst meal I have ever had in Vegas; and I've eaten the $3.99 steak and eggs special on Fremont Street.   I cannot recommend this place to anyone that is not completely 'faced before ever entering the building.",

Hello..... how about if we wanted desserts or takeout afterwards.  When they hand you the check minutes after bringing the food.

The packed parking lot and surrounding curb, a taxi dropping off a fare, cop cars, and the out-of-state plated cars remind me why this modest-looking joint is my choice breakfast locale.  The great: The food. It's that simple. My favorite single item is their french toast. 4 wedges and I'm in heaven (and full). I also enjoy their meatloaf and after a night of drinking, the (huge!) breakfast burrito is quite satisfying. The prices are reasonable too, and you generally get a lot of food for the money.   The not-so-great: I hate to say it, but the service is not as consistent as I'd like. Late night the servers are always super-attentive, but during the day is another story. It seems like it has little to do with how busy they are, as I've gone on a weekday mid-afternoon and the place is maybe 1/4 full and the service was worse than a visit on a bustling Sunday morning.   Still, there's a reason why people from all walks of life come in, it's quite the breakfast joint.",

Seeing the menu online, then the exterior of the restaurant and knowing it was a 24 HR joint sort of lowered our expectations going into it. 24 hour restaurants are usually below average, but we felt this place was a great find.  We arrived around 11:30am on a Saturday and there was a short line up in front of us. We were seated fairly quickly and the staff was pleasant.  I ordered some sort of ground Angus beef steak topped with bacon and cheese, served with eggs (I got scrambled), hashed potatoes and a side of toast. My boyfriend ordered the Meat Lovers Omelacake served with hashed potatoes. Both plates were HUGE. Everything was tasty and we've both never really seen breakfast items like these anywhere else, so it was a treat to try something new and different. They have a pretty big menu and a few of the items are unique from other similar breakfast places.  I'm not sure how their dinner is, but the breakfast was delicious. My honey and I both agreed that the coffee was yummy as well! That's always a very important detail ;)  (*This place fell short of 5 stars for me only because I was brought brown toast instead of white toast the first time my food was served to me, small detail. The waitress brought me the white toast a couple minutes later and apologized for the mix up)",

The pancakes are better than most.  I had a combo with crepes that were fricking yumm!  The blueberries didn't come out of a can!  I like the diner atmosphere and will make it a point to get here for breakfast more often!",

    "text": "This was my third visit to this restaurant and it's been worse with each visit! The only reason I gave it 2 stars rather than 1 star is because the food tasted okay.  It was a little busy, but this was not a good visit! I'll just be brief rather than mentioning all of the annoyances of this visit.  I told her that my mother couldn't eat a whole waffle (she's 88) so I wanted to order a half of waffle.  I knew they sold 1/2 waffles as it was shown on the kids menu for $1.00, our waitress (server #10) said she couldn't sell us that and I said that's fine, but you must have 1/2 waffle she can get since she won't eat a whole one. I told her I wanted it with the fruit composite, an order of bacon and 1 egg. I had a crepe.  Our waitress brings us our two cups of coffee while waiting for the food, the coffee tasted like it had been sitting there for over an hour! I took one sip and moved it to the edge of the table, could not drink such a bad cup.  I told the waitress the coffee tasted really bad and ordered a glass of merlot instead. She took away the full cup of coffee and brought me the glass of merlot.  This may all sound petty, but a GOOD waitress would've worked a combo for elderly to make her meal affordable, and would've gladly removed my coffee from the bill since I didn't drink it due to it tasting bad.  When the bill came, I mistakenly gave her my card without reviewing it.  I received the copy of the bill which just showed the cost:  $43.58 before tip. She didn't even include a breakdown with my copy. I certainly don't think this was worth $43.58: 1/2 waffle with fruit composite 1 crepe with 3 fruit combo 1 side of bacon 1 egg 1 cup of coffee (as she should not have charged for 2) 1 glass of merlot My last visit here thanks to server #10 By the way I did leave a $5.42 tip but that was only because the cooks and other staff deserved something!",

Not that she was rude but just not great. 5 people ordered 5 different things and the food was very good. The menu is kind of overwhelming because you can order almost anything you might want.  I have to warn you the the portions are big and you need to come hungry or prepared to take some home. Normally we don't order desert but they had a chocolate cake that looked delicious and it didn't disappoint. We ordered 4 different desert and all were great. The shocking part is the price of the meals are beyond reasonable. It takes some time to get your food and I think because the have so many choices and we're busy but we were not in a hurry so it was okay. Very family oriented and have a awesome Christian store next to it. The restaurant is not preachy so if your not into that thing don't worry about it.",

And as far as the coffee goes, it's actually pretty good stuff - smooth and freshly roasted.  The retro booths match the trucker-sized meals. The portions are more than big enough to be shared, but since there are so many good options to choose from, sharing one plate sounds like a waste.  I got the ham steak with eggs (over easy), with a stack of blueberry pancakes (I forgot which special this was called, but it's not too hard to find). The ham steak was grilled, juicy, and the size of a man's face. The pancakes, however, were bomb! Fluffy, thick, and filled with fresh blueberries, it lives up to the restaurant's namesake. I honestly could've been happy with a stack of these and an endless cup of coffee.  Overall, Blueberry Hill was a great experience, and I would happily come back here again!",

Got seated right away, our waitress was friendly, but pushy. She tended to all of our needs though which was really all we needed from her lol. Our food was flavorful, but everyone's eggs were watery and cold! As well as the potatoes. That knocked off a star. Their pancakes are ssssooooo good! I highly recommend them. And their coffee. All drinks had free refills which was a plus. Their menu is lengthy!! So if you have an appetite for something in particular, I GUARANTEE they have it. Breakfast, lunch and dinner. I would come back again!",

It has become a tradition for my family and I to go here when leaving Vegas because the breakfast is to die for.  My girlfriend and I had the 1-2-3 Biscuits & Gravy Special. They make homemade fresh in house biscuits and gravy that is delicious! The special is $9.99 for best biscuits and gravy you've ever had plus two eggs and a choice of bacon or sausage. Very filling but delicious with every bite.  Another delicious treat they are known for is their hot chocolate that chocoholics go bonkers for! My brother literally raves about it and it comes with a homemade cookie in your hot coco. Another advertised treat that they have is their iced coffee! Their hazelnut ice coffee was quite delicious.  Our service here was also phenomenal. Our server was hardworking, engaging, down to earth and super helpful. Overall this will continue to be a tradition for us every time we visit Vegas! Highly recommend if you want a locals hot spot while visiting Vegas, this is the Breakfast joint for you!",

I ordered the bacon cheeseburger on sourdough bread with breakfast potatoes and beer battered onion rings and my boyfriend ordered the French toast combo.

    "text": "Blueberry Hill is an awesome breakfast/lunch/dinner joint all around. It is the place you bring family for Sunday brunch, it is the place where you come post a night of crazy partying on the strip, and it is the place you bring all your friends who have heard you raving about this \"Vegas Gem\" for years. This was the case for me during my road trip to see \"Britney: A Piece of Me\" a few weeks back. As our last meal in Vegas, I can proudly say everyone in my party was pleased with the recommendation I pushed on them since the beginning of our mini vacation.             We came in on a Saturday and there was no wait. What??? No wait on one of the busiest brunch days of the week: extra brownie points!  We were seated quickly and our waiter almost immediately came out with iced waters for the entire table. He proceeded to take our drink orders, which he too brought out with the speed of light. Since we are all a group of avid foodies, we had previously studied the menu through Yelp and pretty much knew what we were getting. I ordered the Chocolate Chip Pancakes (my staple choice at this here restaurant), while the rest of my group went for more savory options. The Chocolate Pancakes stand out due to what they deliver; a chocolate indulgence at its finest. There is not one bite lacking chocolaty galore when it comes to these bad boys. As for the rest of my friends' orders, one of my besties (who managed to convince the rest of the five to give this restaurant a go) ordered the Potato Benedict, which she deemed as \"one of the best Benedicts\" she has consumed to date. I tried a bit of the biscuits and gravy off of my friend's dish and \"oh la la\", so so scrumptious. At the end of the meal, everyone was a happy camper and ready to hit the road with full bellies. Food Coma defined!         We all tipped our waiter decently because the man was excellent. This is a trend of Blueberry's all around: excellence in service, food, and ambiance (such a relaxing, homey vibe). Five stars all the way! Sadly, I have yet to try the cakes, pies, or cheesecakes. Next time! There will always be a next between me and Blueberry Hill.",

It's one of the better breakfast places in all of Las Vegas in my opinion! It is a must try!",

This is my third visit to this location and every time the food has been good and the service decent.  This was no exception.  The service was friendly, but not awesome, but they have this TREMENDOUS menu.  Seriously, it's huge and the food is delicious.  This time I stepped away from my usual fried egg and toast breakfast and ordered the Full House.  This came with 2 eggs, 2 slices of bacon, 2 sausage links and two crepes.   The crepes are filled with a cheese mixture and a hot fruit compote.  I'm not a big fan of fruit in my food, especially mushy sweetened fruit, but I was hoping maybe they had orange or peach.  No, strawberry, blueberry or apple.  While I normally would never order something with strawberries in it (I like 'em fresh, but not fake flavored stuff), I went with the strawberry, which really made our waitress happy, by the way.  I'm glad I did because these crepes were DEEEELISH!  Seriously good.  My scrambled eggs were perfectly cooked and perfectly salted.  The bacon was crispy and the sausage flavorful.  I LOVED my meal.  My friend ordered the same thing only with blueberry and she loved it, too.  The husband ordered the turkey club sandwich and the bread came out perfectly lightly toasted and he enjoyed his food.  My friend picked up the check, but I think it was about $30 for the three meals and one iced tea. Not coffee shop CHEAP, but affordable and with the great food, a total value.  Pretty much you can get almost anything you can imagine to eat here.  It exceeded my expectations for a coffee shop which is why I am a fan and will be back!  WHAT CAN THEY DO TO GET FIVE STARS? ~UPDATE THE HECK OUT OF IT.  The truth is that this place is old.  The building is old, the furniture is old, the dishes are old, the menus are old.  THE BATHROOMS ARE OLD.  Yeah, it's sort of part of it's charm and of course if they DID update it the prices would go up, but it can't get a five star rating as is.",

Best way I can describe this place is like an better version of an IHOP. Service is friendly and they never seem to be overly crowded.   I think there are a few locations of this family owned restaurant. This location is right by UNLV and the Flamingo Library. The neighborhood is kinda sketchy so just be careful.",

She didn't hassle us like other waiters and waitresses do, she stopped by frequently enough to refill our drinks (instead of the two refills I normally get there). I was able to get chicken in the salad this time without a hassle, she was super nice and friendly too!! I will definitely return but only order the taco salad if she's here so I can avoid conflict.

We had to leave early to drop someone off at the airport and decided to find somewhere close to our hotel to eat breakfast that would not cost $100. There was not a wait on Sunday morning at 8am. A nice young man selling the paper greeted and opened the door for us. We were greeted with good morning and sat right down. The waitress was fantastic. Worked harder than anyone in Vegas to make us happy. And the food! My word did they give us enough. It was great! Good diner style breakfast. The three year old was even impressed. Now that's impressive! Loved the kids coloring mat; it showed us the owners love Jesus also. What a great place! 5 Stars.",

The gravy was on point and a close rival to my Dads!  my toddler goes back and forth with her food but LOVED the bacon and sausage. If I could have changed one thing, I would have got a half size of the gravy biscuit plate cause it was massive! Either way, loved this place. Music was nice too! I was even impressed with the package of crayons, not some cheap ones thrown on the table that who know how many kids have used or put in the mouth. I will come here every trip back to Vegas!",

The Huevos rancheros were good the beans and rice could use a little more work in the authenticity. Beans tasted like canned beans and the rice was bland. I get it it's not a Mexican restaurant but if your menu also consist of Huevos Rancheros and Chilaquiles you better get close to authentic as you can. I had a taste of the pancakes and the flavor was better than Denny's or IHOP. I would definitely go back but probably stick to the traditional American breakfast.",

While I was living in Las Vegas, the one on Flamingo was closer so when she visited, that's where we went.   Their portion sizes are always very generous, no matter what you get. This most recent time, we went around lunchtime, so instead of getting the amazing chocolate chip, banana, or apple pancakes like I normally get, I ordered the roast beef special. I loved it! The roast beef was sliced thin, but not sandwich meat thin, and the gravy wasn't too salty.   The rest of my family ordered breakfast and typically it would be a little questionable whether or not the portion size would be enough for my brother, since he's a big guy. But even he said he was full after not finishing it all.   For me, whenever I go, it's always one of the aforementioned pancake choices or either of the meatloaf selections. And they never fail, it's always great.   The only reason I gave them a 4 and not a 5 is because the tables are really squished in there and when I walk around, I always feel like I'm going to run into another table. And I carry a big bag so it makes it even more squished. Otherwise, one of my favorite places!",

I am very picky about pancakes because our homemade cakes are much better than I can find in a restaurant... But Blueberry Hill makes great flapjacks!  That said, we had to try the strawberry and apple toppings - fortunately we got them on the side... They had a canned taste, they were awful.  I am docking a star for the toppings.  Stick with the Maple syrup!  The atmosphere is like a 50's diner.  They have an impressive menu with specials on display when you walk in the door.    We will be back next time we are in Vegas!    This area is a bit inconvenient to get to from the Strip, I also would not recommend going at night...  There were some interesting people wandering around during the day...  Definitely much better than other breakfast / pancake houses places in Las Vegas.  Avoid the fake sugary fruit toppings... They will ruin your breakfast!",

I had the most fluffy,buttery tasting pancakes I've ever eaten. Also, they were huge! I had no idea when the server asked if I wanted 3 or 5 that was a tip. Since I love pancakes of course I said 5!  the plate arrived and I knew this was going to be a personal challenge. I failed, I made a great attempt but could only eat 2. However, I will tell you they warmed up great the next day! We revisited for lunch a few days later. I had the Chilaqules Verde. Delicious. The eggs were cooked perfectly, and tbe sauces were wonderful. Definitely recommend this as a stop on your trip.",

It's a little bit off the strip so it's about a $15 cab ride to get here so take that into consideration.

    "text": "This restaurant made my entire trip worth coming to Las Vegas, NV!  HANDS DOWN....the BEST pancake place I've ever eaten at.  My mouth enveloped the most buttery, lightest buttermilk pancakes ever.  Crispy bacon (by order) with scrambled eggs and sausage.    Forget the sausage and eggs.  I was into the pancakes and bacon.  Everything I saw coming out of the kitchen looked yummy.  A guy next to me had the Chilaquiles Verde and my goodness Im gonna have to switch up how I eat breakfast.  Spoke with Phil (host) and he was so delightful.  Our server Violeta was very attentative to our needs.  This place makes homemade almost everything!!!  Its like a truck stop/diner pit stop type place.  Named after Chuck Berry's song Blueberry Hill!  Well, I've found my thrill at this place with the best food!",

The manager always makes sure to keep the customers waiting for a table informed of the status, which makes the wait bearable. We brought my family for breakfast for the first time before heading home and the food was still great, but the waitress was disappointing. She rarely checked on us and the other waitress from a different section had to fill our coffee mugs. She then returns with an excuse that she didn't want us to think that she forgot us, but that she was waiting for a fresh pot. A bit of communication would've worked. She later on made sure to walk by and ignore us some more after seeing the small tip we left on our credit card slip. She is lucky we left any at all and it was only because we frequent that location often. The food is definitely the best out of all the locations we have tried. The blueberry pancakes, omelets, and waffles with chicken apple sausage are my favorites.",

I went with the belgian waffle that had fresh fruit on top - bananas, apples, strawberries, and blueberries of course. my fav of all was the bananas and blueberries. If i ordered this again id def stick to those 2 for the whole thing. omg. it was really good. but paled in comparison to my bf chicken fried steak order. wow. that was good but waayyy less healthy.  The atmosphere was your typical diner and it was really cute and quaint. The food came out super quick and made me wonder wow - how many people are back there b/c the place was really full. I'd def. go back to this place, and its cheaper than hash house a go go.",

    "text": "This place was really disappointing. We came here because of the good reviews and low price rating, but the prices were ridiculous for what they gave you. Definitely not worth it. The food looked so unappetizing I couldn't even look at it. I ordered the French toast breakfast, the eggs were okay at best, the hash browns looked and tasted awful, and the French toast just tasted weird. I came here starving but ended up hardly touching my food. Very disappointing, and I'm not picky. I don't recommend to anyone, if you want awesome cheap breakfast, go to Babystacks. It's the only place I clean my plate every time, and the prices are significantly less than this place.",

The only bit that got me was they only serve certain things during certain hours and my first pick was not one being served then. They have a huge range of choices though so we ate like pigs.",

I ask ashamed, \"Are you hungry?\" She looked back, more ashamed because she was the adult, \"Yeah.\" So we hit Blueberry Hill and had a Alaskan Waffle...each. My love of the restaurant was born.  For out of towners, visiting BH should be a tradition unlike any other. The Yelp description of a five-star is dead on: \"Whoohoo! As good as it gets!\" BH should be the standard by which every chain breakfast place compares themselves. A conventional breakfast haus, the food is good, the servings are large, the pries are fair, and the service is great.  Go to Blueberry Hill. It's not far off the strip and you'll feel a hell of a lot better grabbing a breakfast there (and getting away from the Strip).",

I have been there with 10 people and for such a small kind of place, they have always found space for us to sit together. I made friends with one of the older waitresses. She is adorable.   I have never waited a ridiculous amount of time for my food. One I came in at 9:15am, had my food at 9:20, give or take a minute. It was so fast.   It is inexpensive and open 24 hours! As a college student it is perfect for those late night cravings of some good french toast or anything really. When my family comes into town there is no doubt that when asked where do they want to eat this weekend, \"Blueberry Hill, duh!\" At least once they have to eat there when they are in town. Its awesome.   They have deals all the time too.  I had French Toast, Eggs, and Bacon for 5.99, but it was the before 11am special. I think thats pretty cheap and it is way way way better then Denny's even though I can't hate on Denny's too much. :)   On another visit, it was a busy Saturday, but the folks I was with, we had sat there and was walking for 3 hours and not once did they ask us to move or hurry up and leave when we finished eating 2 hours before. It was nice to just be able to sit there and converse with your friends and not being pushed away because they needed the tables for others.   They are pretty quick at getting tables cleaned and ready to go for the next guests as soon as the previous ones have left. I have never waited more than 20min, even when the parking lot was full and cars had to start parking on the street.   Great environment, great food, and the best french toast ever! (So far)",

Four pieces of chicken covering each of the quarters of waffles.  Strawberry compote (from crepes) went fabulously well with this ridiculous combination. I kept thinking these disparate mealtime pieces had no business being together.   I was so wrong.  The four cheese (cottage, cream, sour&?) crepes (two) filled the plate. Just the right amount of sweet to savory balance.  It came with choice of fruit compote. I chose strawberry on the side.  I like to taste the main part before dousing it with something all to sweet.  Good thing.  'Cause my Partner-in-Dine used it on her chicken and waffles.  She also ordered cheese fries (not on menu and not a problem).  We expected cheddar cheese but got American which, was just as good.  My crepes came with three eggs and my choice of crispy bacon.  Done right.  Everything from greeting upon entry to accommodating both of our particular preferences with a smile and speed.  No sense our server was hiding an eye roll.  She made us happy and made us believe she was happy to serve us.  We will be back.  And the next day we were.  To a different location this time.  My First PID had the Veal Parmigiana.  The veal was nearly 3/4 inch thick and the batter was thin and crispy.  Too often it is the reverse.  PID2 had to try the Chicken and Waffles.  He is picky about this kind of thing, too.  He finished them off.  I had eggs & bacon cooked exactly as I ordered (I am finicky about this, as many other things) and pancakes so light, fluffy, sweet, and HUGE.  I couldn't finish it all.  Unusual for me not to leave a clean plate.  But, I was so full there was just no way.  Service here was equally as good as at the other location.  Highly recommend.",

Couple of beers and a salad with the HUGE turkey dinner with stuffing, gravy, mashed, cranberries, buns and I needed the long walk back to the flamingo to not feel so stuffed.  I love walking in Vegas, using the Tram and public transportation...anyone going there...I recommend it as a better way to know the city. Contact me directly for pointers on visiting Vegas for the least amount of $$....I have a few tricks.",

    "text": "When you go to Las Vegas as a tourist, you go to the strip or maybe Fremont, or, if you're exceptionally bizarre, one of the hundred floating smaller casinos orbiting in the cash-burdened gravity of the big hotels.   And when you read five star reviews, you expect L'Atelier or Carnevino or any of the other big name establishment restaurants monikered by a big-time chef.  You'd be right to, and this isn't an attack on those places, places that offer some of the best eating in the country.  Instead, this is in praise of the cafe, of the appreciably local, of what separates Flamingo, Tropicana and Fremont from what is otherwise an ordinary American town.    Blueberry Hill is that place, an excellent cafe with experienced wait staff, quality food, and without the adornments you find in more classically targeted tourist locations.  The plates are the same speckled white-ish gray you seem to find in these places but no where else.    We went with the biscuits and gravy, coffee and the waffle with blueberries.  Everything was fantastic.  It all came out hot and we all left stuffed.  Blueberry Hill is quickly becoming an every trip stop, despite - or maybe because of - it's off-strip location and its complete lack of Vegas-style bells and whistles.",

    "text": "While in Vegas a few weeks ago, a friend and I were the first one's awake and decided we'd go somewhere off The Strip for breakfast. My friend said that Blueberry Hill was a great family owned restaurant, and since I'm all for supporting local businesses, I was game.  We grabbed the last 2 seats at the counter because we didn't feel like waiting for a booth. This turned out to be a good call... less than 5 minutes later, the line spilled out into the parking lot which seemed like a sign that this place was the bees-knees.    EH.   The menu is expansive and resembles the 25 page menu at The Cheesecake Factory where you're presented with so many options that you're incapable of making a decision.   Pricing was very reasonable by Vegas standards.  I ordered the Philly Cheese Steak omelet ($11-$12) which turned out to be filled with sinewy beef portions. It wasn't horrible, it just took too much effort. The portions, however, are gargantuan and worthy of splitting with a friend.   They serve a decent cup of coffee, along with all the flavored creamers you could ask for.   Essentially, Blueberry Hill is a glorified IHOP. I don't necessarily mean that in a negative way because I love IHOP pancakes and will likely serve them at my wedding reception someday. However, I can assure you that you won't be laying on your death bed wishing you patronized Blueberry Hill at some point in your life. But, if you're hungover in Vegas and just need quick sustenance, you've found your place.",

As everyone has mentioned, the menu is huge, as are the portions. I had the blueberry pancake special, which had two big pancakes, eggs, hash browns and sausage, while my mom had the strawberry crepes, eggs, and ham.  Everything was served hot and fresh. My pancakes were thick and dense, but I REALLY loved my mom's crepes! I will definitely have to try them next time I visit. I didn't love the ham (it was really salty), but everything else was good.  It was definitely old-school and a little dated, but everything appeared clean and the service was friendly. We had leftovers, too!",

And the biscuits were amazingly light and fluffy and the gravy had tons of flavor my wife had pancakes and they were Literally a half inch thick and she got three of them at least 8 inches in diameter I think she ate maybe half and my friend He ordered the ham and cheese and spinach omelette amazing he says he's been there multiple times always good my son had the monte Cristo he loved it the portions are huge you will pay a little bit more for breakfast when you order here but you could easily share a meal and still get full it's well worth it.",

The cooks on the other hand, need some serious training. We sat at the bar area and right away we were able to tell that one of the cooks had no idea what he was doing. He was complaining super loud and started arguing with one of the waitress. She as well continued the argument instead of brushing it off. A young server also stood next to the waitress and called the cook a name.. it was super busy so it might have been stress that caught up to them, but that is very unprofessional and there is no excuse for them arguing in front of their customers.",

The guys had gotten there first and they had set them up on 4 tables next to each other. When we got there the man at the door very rudely told us that we are not allowed to go in until they figure things out. So we wait... 5 min later no one came to get us so we went in and joined the boys...   Waitress was soooo slow. It took her over 15 min to ask us for drinks... then another 20 to bring it...   We ordered our food, some people at the table got food, some didn't..,  We had to remind her 5 times to bring BBQ sauce... Reminded her 4 times that one of the girls didn't have a fork...   Then we find HAIR in the food!!! GROOOOSSSS... we had to send it back, did we get an apology? NOPE... she gave us attitude took it back, and then brought another plate after 10 min.  Food was not that great either, I got a caesar salad, for some reason on the menu it said with tomatoes and onions... I asked for no onions.. it came with onions, I didnt complain just picked them out.. and no cheese or croutons on it.. =/ Not satisfied...  Rest of the food that everyone else got was just ok! nothing special...   Asked for refills on the water, didn't get them until after the check was given!   The waitress was rude, slow, and didn't bring us anything we asked for... top it off no silverware, one was dirty, and there was hair in the food... will I be back? Take a wild guess!! NOPE",

With an excellent staff that gets you in a great mood and food that leaves your tastes buds more than satisfied,  you can't go wrong with Blueberry Hill! This is my second time here and still haven't been disappointed, if anything my visit this time was better than the last. Today we tried the \"Chicken and Waffles\" and \"Chocolate OREO Pancakes\"! Both of which were nothing short of delicious. Each has their own unique taste that keeps you wanting \"one more bite\" as long as you find yourself able to stomach the great portions that they give you, it shouldn't be a problem at all. If you like chocolate and you like pancakes for breakfast the chocolate OREO pancakes are definitely the way to go! The OREO cookies and bits are cooked right into the pancake and topped off with a sauce that is what I beleive to be OREO cream itself! (if I am wrong please don't tell me) and last but not least the chicken and waffles! This dish blended the sweetness of a dessert and hardiness of a breakfast meal. It caught me off guard with flavors that you would think to be very conflicting ones, turning it Into an epic combination of fulfillment and delight! I'd love to go on even more but that's all for today, I will definitely be back to try more of the food they have to offer! It is well worth the visit!!!!!!!!!!",

Since I don't drink coffee I moved it to the end of the table so it could be removed. When our server came to the table it was straight business. No greeting or pleasantries. That's fine. I get it, you're busy. I ordered an appetizer of spicy wings. I clarified I didn't want Buffalo wings. Guess what I got? Not to mention it was 20 mins later. Our meals came 10 minutes after that. The food left a lot to be desired. Did I mention that the coffee cup with the old food and hair on it was still on the table. Apparently our server didn't think much about it. Save yourself the aggravation and just keep driving by this place.",

My husband had the biscuits & gravy & the biscuits melted in your mouth, so good! I was almost mad that I didn't get that. Our waitress was really sweet but it seemed like she had way too many tables. A couple of the tables by us were running her ragged so she didn't get to check on us as much but I used to waitress so I totally understand.

The food here makes me happy in a nostalgic way, too.   Quite reminiscent of NY diner food, open 24/7: I've been a fan since my office was walking distance years ago. Great place to go for breakfast all day, or when you have a group who can't agree on a specific cuisine, or breakfast, lunch, or dinner, for that matter, etc.   Cheesy, well-worn and outdated decor is alright when you are being served fluffy pancakes, crisp waffles, good burgers, AOk soups and tasty sammies by cheerful wait staff. Exactly what it is supposed to be: comfort food whenever you want it. My folks frequent the Decatur location, and I've found them consistently good, too. The strawberry malted (extra thick, with blender cup on side) always makes me happy = do it!   * if you order sammies that come with mayo: 'on the side' is a good call here, they slather it on (blech ;) *  ** they can deliver True, soft scrambled eggs = why can't everyone?!?! **  *** 24/7 just about anything you could order in a diner on E Coast ***   **** portions trend gargantuan; bake fresh daily muffins & desserts ****   ***** Senior discounts, kids menu, two daily specials (at least) I heart the beer battered cod on Fridays *****   Dunno why my photos aren't linking, but they're in here, amongst the gallery: Turkey Club, Clam Chowda & curly fries ;)",

They are big, fluffy, and full of flavor. I ordered the Country Breakfast with a side of hash browns and I had more than enough food. Although I have only been here for breakfast, they are open 24hours a day. Their dinner items do not look too appetizing so I think I will stick to visiting only for breakfast.  Blueberry Hill is located off the strip, is very inexpensive and has it's own parking lot. It isn't a fancy restaurant but the food definitely makes it's exterior appearance irrelevant.",

    "text": "Where there's Waffle House in the South, Denny's in California, Blueberry Hill has been a staple it seems in Nevada for their diner type food. When you walk in, it truly does remind you of walking into a Denny's, Norm's, or any other chain diner type establishment, though Blueberry Hill is a family owned operation. Our waitress was sweet, but firm, being from NY (as she was proud to tell us), she didn't put up with much, but got the job done and it was refreshing to be honest with you. She was there to do her job, and she was compensated (tip) with the service she provided. We sat on the counter as we were hungry and counter locations are normally a quick seat and serve, and you're on your way at most places.  I ordered the Texas Omelette which is an omelette topped with Texas chili, American cheese, and onions. It was accompanied with a stack of fluffy (3) pancakes and I ordered a side of biscuits and gravy on the side. The omelette was pretty good, but I enjoyed the pancakes and biscuits the most out of my meal on this visit. The biscuits and gravy had a nice sausage and pepper flavor without it being overly salty like most places. There was so much food I ended leaving half for my finacee to eat back at our hotel. On my next visit, I would be more than happy to give Blueberry another visit and try more items off their menu.",

Also, I love trying local establishments and was excited to know that they exist only in Las Vegas!!  As soon as we walked in the diner like establishment was pretty apparent and we were seated at our table pretty quickly. Our waitress was great at the beginning getting our drink orders, but she was not that attentive through the rest of our meal. She never came back to refill my dad's coffee and also didn't bother checking in on us as to how the food was until she brought us our check!! :(  As for the food, it was excellent!! The potato pancakes were pretty good and the eggs were cooked perfectly! Also, the blueberry crepes were really well made and were delicious!!  So although the overall experience at Blueberry Hill was a 4/5, the food was definitely a 5/5!!",

I had the Guadalajara Chorizo skillet & it was SO good!  The chips & salsa were fresh & flavorful.  For dinner I had the Italian meatloaf & it is served with a side of spaghetti, too much food for me so I brought the rest back to our room for later.     My best friend will be in Vegas in 2 days & I have alread text her recommending this restaurant.

I usually don't give a 5 Star review because it takes a lot for me to be truly impressed with a business. We were a party of eight and having a 7 year old and a 1 year old and trying to fit in a booth was hard because we had my sister in town and all wanted to sit together.  The manager was able to accommodate us even though I got to admit I am really picky . We then found a booth we could squeeze in together and then our server , Raul, gave us top notch service.  All the staff were so busy but all were polite . Raul definitely took care of us and we were quite impressed with his overall calmness as we were quite a handful . The food portion was ALOT MORE than we expected and definitely yummy! I ordered the Oreo pancakes and I've never tasted a more moist flavorful thick pancake in my life! That's going to be my regular favorite :) Told the manager before we left that we'll definitely be back!   Thank you for an awesome experience you guys!",

    "text": "Why can't they have these kinds of restaurants everywhere!! I really love everything about Blueberry Hill. They have amazing food, excellent service, prices are good, and the location is also easy to find.   Food, food, food is what you get here. Anything you order here comes in large portions! I made the mistake of ordering several things when I first came here as I didn't know they give you a lot. Love the fresh fruit waffles and pancakes, Classic Egg Benedict, Bacon and cheese omelet, Meat Lover's skillet, and so many more of the items. Can't go wrong with the food here and they have something for everyone. They are always willing to customize an order for you also if you don't like something that a dish comes with. Yum Yum Yum!  The wait staff here are nice, but usually super busy so you can be waiting around awhile for them to bring your drinks, food or just come around to check up on you. Some are more friendly and make sure their customers are happy and some are just there doing their job and nothing more.   The building looks older, but not run down. The inside is older looking, but maybe they're trying to keep that \"diner\" look going, They have two sides which they usually keep only one side open if they don't have many customers. They don't have a problem with keeping the place full though, especially on the weekend. Tables are clean almost immediately when people leave so other people can be seated. Floors are kept clean and mopped when they need it. Bathrooms have always been cleaned no matter the time of day I've come.   Will be back many more times and would recommend this spot.",

I actually found this place on Yelp and looked at the pictures and my peeps and I agreed this place is what we needed :0)  The service is 10++ our server never got annoyed with our many requests(water refills , sugar free syrup ect) and we loved that on each table they had a tray full Of everything we needed like Ketchup, hot sauce, salt n pepper, Cream and many kinds of sweeteners.   The food was in ginormous portions and of course we have big eyes and had plenty of food left for breakfast then next day (I couldn't even eat my chocolate pancakes because my skillet filled me up!)  Everything was yummy the place was clean and services was perfect. Check out my pics and try this place you won't be disappointed !",

We were in search of a decent breakfast spot that didn't require parking and a hike through a casino, or waiting 45 minutes to be seated ... needless to say, this fit the bill!   We were seated immediately despite the restaurant being pretty full. I ordered an omelet and was given a choice of side. I went with the house potatoes and toast. The food does the trick, but I wouldn't call it spectacular. My husband actually really didn't like the steak skillet, he complained it had no flavor and didn't finish his meal.   The menu is HUGE! Tons for everyone to choose from.  Service was wonderful. Our waitress, Victoria, was very attentive and helpful.  The price was OK for Vegas. It was right around $55 for myself, my husband, and one kids meal shared between my two toddlers.   Overall, it's a nice place, but probably more like 3.5 stars, than 4 stars in my opinion.   I would definitely come here again although I'm not sure my husband will be joining me. :/",

As usual when in Vegas I tend to travel off the Strip and dine with the Locals. This habit has never failed me yet for a meal, and after B H I'm still on a roll. I tried the  biscuits and gravy with the eggs over medium and bacon. Now while my breakfast was simple but good I saw some amazing looking things coming out of that kitchen. Pancakes and Waffles with various toppings, Omelettes that couldn't be believed by sight alone. It all had me doubting my own order. But rest assured mine was delicious. Huge home made biscuits (I couldn't finish one) creamy Sausage gravy and perfectly cooked eggs I was content. Service was very good and the prices are fair. Portions are rather large so feel free to split away. This place will be in my Vegas breakfast rotation.",

Every time I come here, I get fast service, delicious food, and I can get out the door spending less than $15 after tip. Try doing that on the Strip anymore. You can't.  It's busier on the weekends than on the weekdays, and depending upon the time of night the patrons can be entertaining in their state of inebriation. But you can't pass up the cinnamon roll style pancakes. It's more carbs and sugar than you should eat in one sitting. But it's so delicious that you'll just have to walk it off all day anyway.",

I wish I could say I experimented with other items but 90% of time I get the same thing , the meat lovers skillet extra egg ( over medium ) and extra cheese , here I'm a creature of habit and rarely differ from this order anytime of day !! here's why , country potatoes cooked to perfection and well seasoned , with peppers and onions , and a huge helping of breakfast sausage , ham and bacon all diced into very large chunks, topped off with melted cheddar cheese!! I usually get it with a biscuit which are large and fluffy and a side of country gravy that is thick and flavorful ( especially if you come for lunch or dinner , for me the thicker the better ) , their pancakes are also a good choice as they are huge and make a good compliment when slathered in butter or the occasional sourdough toast also slathered in butter , lol . I usually ask for a side of their homemade salsa to give it all a little kick . The service here has always been good except one time late next night . FYI this usually is an expensive breakfast as all the add ons are extra $'s but it all is cooked to perfection and if you want cheap there is always McDonald's breakfast !!",

    "text": "Okay, so we visited this place twice.  5 stars are for the first visit and the food. The loss of 2 stars is for the waitress at the 2nd visit and the charge of the Alfredo sauce.   First trip was on a Saturday later in the day.  Great, great service and amazing food.  The sourdough toast was so good, we asked our waitress if it was made on site.  She let us know it was purchased from Great Buns Bakery down the street, which we have bought from twice since our visit.    We were so impressed with the service and the food, that we looked at this as our new go to family spot.  We had multiple breakfast items and chicken strips.   2nd visit today, sucked!  We were immediately greeted and sat down.  The waitress overwhelmed by a family with 6 screaming kids at 2 combined tables came over and greeted us quickly; great right?  It went downhill from there.  We even questioned ourselves what did we do wrong that she seemed \"bothered and annoyed\" by us.  We were overly friendly and ordered simple items. I ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo with extra Alfredo sauce.  My daughter ordered the chicken strips with honey mustard.  When the waitress brought the food which was quit quickly there was no honey mustard and no extra Alfredo sauce, and I didn't notice until she had walked away.  As she was setting the plates down, I commented to her that on our last visit my daughter stated \"the chicken strips were the best she had ever had.\"  While telling the waitress this she didn't even look at me, she was looking behind me out the window.  Really, really, hate that.  We waited at our tables for her to come back around for the sauces.  It was 8 minutes before she came back, and that was with flagging her down.  It took another 4 minutes to get the honey mustard and another 3 minutes after that for the Alfredo sauce.    She brought us our check and then asked us which desserts we wanted that we had previously added to our meals . We ordered 2 blueberry muffins which were so delicious we decided to get 2 more to go.  The waitress came back over and I said to her \" Would it be too much of a problem to get 2 more muffins to go?\"  She picked up the check, paused, and then said \"It shouldn't be.\"  Really, it shouldn't be?  How about yes, yes, or yes.    This waitress sucked and completely ruined our opinion of this place.  I wish I knew the name of the other waitress so I could call before coming to make sure she was working.   I do have to say the Alfredo sauce had absolutely ZERO flavor and ZERO taste.  The best part of the Alfredo sauce she \"CHARGED ME FOR IT.\"  If she had put it extra on the meal as I had ordered, I probably wouldn't have been charged for it.  This cost her a chunk of her tip!!!!",

I heard about this place place from a Las Vegas Forum that had a thread about  good breakfasts.   I was craving waffles. I ordered their regular waffle, but I also wanted to save some room for their Chocolate, Chocolate Layer Cake that caught my eye. I ordered it a la mode. The waffle came and it was very good. One of the better waffles I've had. It's kinda hard to mess-up a waffle though. Especially when you are an American \"Family Restaurant.\"   However, I have to say that their chocolate, chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream was amazing. They say it's homemade and I believe it! It had great, smooth chocolate taste, but not over-the-top richness. You gotta get this dessert with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The vanilla ice cream complements the chocolate cake perfectly. It's a fairly big portion so you can share, but you won't want to! It's a great value for the price you pay. About $4.00. It's also one of the best \"Desserts in the Desert\" that I have experienced so far.",

It is a Diner that serves all hours of the day.   I was writing this review but it randomly deleted HALF of my review. I'm really pissed...oh well.  So I'm going to keep this short and sweet.  I LOVE THEIR FRENCH TOAST!!!  HOLY MOTHER FREAKING AMAZINGNESS IN MY ORIFICE ON MY FACE!!!   That is all.  Ook not really.  So I had their omelette also.  HOLY CANOLI SPICCOLI! Their omelettes are TWICE! yes, TWICE the size of most places. The reason being is (I believe) that they use the eggs from the carton instead of real eggs. Either way, AWESOMENESS for a FATTY like ME!  ok I'm over the caps lock pretending to yell thing.  Just go. It's a Diner, don't expect 5 star service. Be happy they have good food, at reasonable prices.  It is a diner.",

    "text": "I love this place for breakfast!!!  Multiple locations throughout Las Vegas. Most of the time it's seat yourself. Busy times you wait to be seated. The menus are on the tables. Best described as a regular Denny's/IHOP/diner. No decor, no wow factor, just tables and booths. The menus is huge! No seriously like 10 pages and everything is available 24/7.   The food is good. The cakes are homemade and have yummy buttercream frosting. The cakes are heavy and moist so you know there is nothing healthy, fat free, lite, or sugar free. My favorite is the strawberry cake.   The sandwiches are ok. The fries ok. The onion rings are beer battered. I had ordered the meatloaf sandwich that comes with cheese, country sausage gravy, onions on a roll. It's huge but I didn't like it that much. The meatloaf had ketchup on it and the mashing of ketchup and white gravy doesn't mix well to me.   Breakfast is where this place shines!!!! And like I said its 24/7. I love their breakfasts, the giant pancakes, the waffles, the country fried steak. I'm a happy camper with breakfast and cake here!!! I love crepes!!! And this time I had the crepe dealer with strawberry compote. Comes two crepes, eggs, choice of meat. And I added a side of hash browns. The fresh fruit crepe is really good too!!! I wish they had a savory crepe.   I've been here a bunch of times. If you go on Sunday make sure you get there early or afternoon the church crowd gives a huge wait to be seated.",

When the waiter came to take our order however, you can tell he was swamped with previous tables and tables about to be given to him. I'm not saying he was rude but a bit worked up.   I ordered the hot chocolate which is supposed to come with a cookie.. Sadly I didn't get the cookie. Maybe they ran out or he forget. Anyways I tried to brush that off. For breakfast I ordered the south of the border Benedict which I'm sorry to say was not very good. But according to my family members they said their plate was really good. So I guess it was a poor choice of selection on my part.   All in all I would have to say that my visit here was just okay. Although, I would like to go back to this restaurant and try something else off the menu. Maybe next time I will be a bit luckier in choosing a better selection.",

Corned beef hash was prepared a little different than my mom makes, but it was still amazing.  Sourdough toast, and biscuits were both amazing!  The sourdough biscuits were a perfect brown on the bottom, but soft and fluffy throughout.  Hot chocolate....amazing.  I was brave and tried something new.  The meatloaf topped with bacon and white gravy was surprisingly good, enough to feed 2 or 3. Service was great, very relaxed atmosphere.",

    "text": "Wanted to escape the strip so we came in here for breakfast before hitting the road. Basing my decision on the delicious looking pictures on yelp, I was expecting this place to be good. The hash browns were cooked incredibly unevenly as some parts were not cooked all the way through. The cheddar in the cheddar-spinach omelette I ordered was so stringy and felt like plastic in my throat. The pancakes were the worst. They didn't have that same buttermilky goodness like a pancake is supposed to have and was falling apart! You can't even pick it up with a fork. When our server handed us the syrup, the bottle was already sticky and dripping all over the table. One of our spoons were dirty. The service did not compensate. Our server, a lady who wore her platinum blonde hair in a pony tail, came off a little harsh. I asked her if it was possible to get both the omelette and the hash browns in one order and she just told me to read the menu instead of pointing out a suggestion. The dishes I was looking at included pancakes, which I said I didn't want. She replies on this sassy voice, \"You won't get pancakes.\" Ok, cool. I didn't want them anyway. Instead of encouraging us to buy more, she warned each one of us that we wouldn't be able to finish the food. Guess what? At the end, though the food wasn't good, the plates were licked clean. We showed her!",

    "text": "OMGosh, I think I OD'd and went to blueberry heaven!  So I was being my usual indecisive self and couldn't decide on what I want for breakfast. I eventually narrowed it down to \"blueberry\" so I quickly searched on my Yelp app and this place came up.   Blueberry pancakes topped with more blueberries! YUM! (see pics!)  And instead of coffee, my friend and I ordered an old-fashioned vanilla sundae and poured blueberry syrup on it. So delish!  Service is eh. I probably got the same server as Lara. It was a bit slow but the food was definitely worth the wait :)",
