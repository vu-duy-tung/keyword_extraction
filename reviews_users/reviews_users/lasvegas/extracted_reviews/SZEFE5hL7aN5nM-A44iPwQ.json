    "text": "This is a long one so I'll sum it up for the skimmers: terrible service, pretentious atmosphere, as expected steakhouse food (if you want an incorrectly cooked steak), about $150/person with a drink, app and steak...spend your money elsewhere.   I so wanted to love this place! That was however most definitely NOT the case. We started the experience by having a manager approach my brother and ask him to roll down his pants. My brother is a fashion stylist and was in Gucci and looked great, meanwhile guys in Levi's and kids in ripped jeans are walking by, no problem. But ok, fine, we get it....dress code is dress code. You would think said manager would later stop by to check on us given how he started the experience...he did not, strike 2. We just got back from a trip to Napa so we brought our own bottle of wine, we called ahead and found out the corking fee was $50...steep, but fine. When we sat down the waiter aggressively told us that the corking fee was $50, three times! As if we were stupid or he'd convince us to buy his overpriced wine? Strike 3. Our salads came and they were good, the Caesar was a typical steakhouse Caesar but the wedge was really good. Delicious blue cheese dressing. Now they were starting to redeem themselves, a little. After the salad course it took a good 30 minutes before our steaks came out. That is way too much time between courses in my opinion. When my rib eye came out it was over cooked. I order medium rare and it was at least medium plus bordering on well done. I told the waiter (new guy, maybe second in command?) that my steak was over cooked. He aggressively questioned me. Told me I needed to cut it in the middle to be sure, so I did and it was. He held it up, shined a light on it and was like, no this is our medium rare and that's what you ordered. He was so condescending and rude it was ridiculous! Finally my brother told him to take it back and cook it properly. They brought it out again and this time it was rare. I ate it because I just wanted to get out of there. Oh and during the wait, while my entire family was enjoying their meal, did said manager or waiter #1 come ask me if I needed anything or apologize? Nope. In fact, waiter #1 didn't even check on us at all after our steaks came out, he came back at the end to ask if we wanted dessert which we of course passed on. Overall, the food was fine, but not worth the inflated prices and terrible, condescending service. We will never return and will be spreading the word. If you're up for a pretentious place with staff that think they're better than you, then go ahead and drop $150/head here. If not, go elsewhere. In fact, I was at Fix, Bellagio's cheaper steakhouse and had a much better experience. My date's (a chef) steak was over cooked there and they handled it flawlessly. They took it back immediately and the manager came to check on us and bright him a scotch. My recommendation - spend your money elsewhere.",

    "text": "It's so funny how the best meals are often the ones you don't plan for.  Was having drinks at the Bellagio with some clients and this turned into dinner. We popped into Prime and managed to score a lateish sitting with minimal wait time.  This was my first visit to Prime, and I'll say it has now usurped SW @ Wynn as my favourite Vegas steakhouse.   The decor is understated and classy, dining and conversation noise seems muted due to the room set up, the service is comfortable and professional and the food is just bloody superb.  We enjoyed a few dry aged rib eyes (absolutely massive - see photo) which were seriously well cooked and not overly fatty (no reflux the next morning - awesome!).  The mushroom, asparagus and spinach sides were also completely up to par.  The only area where SW has Prime beat hands down is the bread basket.  The SW bread basket comes with piping hot, freshly baked bread ranging from cheese&bacon, olive to sourdough etc.  The Prime offering was actually a tiny bit stale and nothing to write home about.  All in all, Prime is a very classy, comfortable yet upscale steakhouse and an excellent experience.  It is definitely not cheap (steaks start at $70 - our bill for 3 people before tip was $580ish with one bottle of mid level Cab) but definitely worth a visit.",

Hostess staff was disappointing - didn't seem to care that we were there for our 20 year anniversary and that we requested a patio table months in advance. Kept trying to seat us inside even though outside tables were available. They tried to explain that the 4 top tables were for larger parties instead of our party of two yet they were trying to seat us inside at a 4 top. Once we were finally seated, the hostess just dropped us at the table without any further acknowledgment, as if she were annoyed to sit us there. As we were dining, several other 4-tops outside were sat with parties of two which contradicted what we were told multiple times. Made what was supposed to be a really special night start out very frustrating, especially for the amount of money we spent. I don't usually write reviews but felt compelled to share our story. Overall the dinner was lovely. Just started out really disappointing.",

Service was slow although the 4 wait staff we had were attentive.   When the meals finally came we were definitely underwhelmed.  My filet was overcooked... ordered it medium and there was no pink inside.   My husband had the peppercorn crusted NY strip ordered medium and his was absolutely rare to medium-rare - red cold center.  We did not send them back... we were cold and had already been there an hour and a half.  Sides and salads were good as were our drinks.   Nothing over the top, but good.  Overall have had a much better steak from Flemings back in our hometown... for a much more reasonable price.  For the price of our meal and after the recommendation from friends  I had expected much more.",

    "text": "We had a lovely dinner last night. The host staff was very accommodating by reserving a table on the patio for our dinner. The patio was beautiful, and the view of the fountain show was spectacular. It was a very intimate, date-worthy spot. Our food was delicious, with my bone-in ribeye cooked perfectly, melting in my mouth. The service was a little spotty. My date had to ask a few different people for his soft drink several times. Our server (I cannot remember his name - he was probably in his thirties, Asian-American with glasses) was very rigid and quite inattentive. I could tell he was profiling his tables and spending the majority of his time with the wealthiest looking table in his section. His SA was very pleasant, and very attentive. The food runner did auction off our entrees, which is something that I'm not accustomed to at establishments like this, but was very pleasant. The portion size of the bacon wrapped shrimp was awkward since there were two people enjoying it, but the sauce was to die for, and the shrimp AND bacon were cooked perfectly. I would order this again, just for myself, though. I am eager to return to try more of the seafood and wine selections. #ComingFromPeopleInTheIndustry",

I just wanted to go back just for this.   Mac and cheese: Very cheesy but it also had a soft taste and the cheese they used didn't overwhelm us. It was really delicious.

We were lucky to get in as the guest service manager at the hotel we were at (Encore) worked his magic to get us a table in such short notice.   Prime is truly fine dining at its best, everything from the food to the ambiance was amazing. We both had the filet mignon, I had the 10 oz. and he had the 12 oz. For sides we ordered the mac & cheese, truffle mash potatoes and the chili broccoli....the truffle mash was heaven!!   After dinner they even brought us out a desert with \"Happy Anniversary\" written on the plate with chocolate (compliments of the restaurant!) Needless to say, the staff went above and beyond to make our dinner extra special. This is a great place for a romantic dinner for sure, 5 stars!",

It was preceded with an Onion Soup appetizer. I had mashed Yukon Gold potatoes with my steak. The Ribeye steak was judged to be ok, not in keeping with Prime's reputation. A Shrimp salad was deemed very good. A Broccoli side dish was considered strange, it was seasoned with fresh mint. Not to the liking of those who tried it. Our waiter was genial, yet we had a feeling of strained politeness from the waitstaff team - and a collective sense of moving our party out as fast as possible.

    "text": "Ok first of all, this review isn't based on the quality of food, but on the experience I had with my friends and my girlfriend.        My girlfriend, our friends and I, had made reservations for tonight, about a month ago, at 8 pm (7/1/16) for my girlfriend's birthday. We came for dinner and were told that we would have to wait an hour to be seated outside as we requested, which was fine because we really wanted to see the view for our dinner. So we waited a little over an hour and were finally seated at 9:08 The server was polite and very professional when taking our orders. And the wait began.        So after waiting an hour to be seated, we had waited for over an hour with still no food. And let me remind you that this dinner was to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday. So we were all hungry and anxious, waiting for our food and my girlfriend is getting upset. Our server who was very polite and apologetic, had to repeatedly go and check on our food.         After about an hour with no food except bread and water our server had came back to apologize another time and had told us that the manager would come speak to us about the horrendous wait time for our food. The so called \"manager\" came to our table to apologize. I had to give her a piece of mind to give her a sense of what we were going through. Waiting an hour to be seated and another hour with NO FOOD! And on my girlfriend's birthday too..  This \"manager\" INTERUPTS me MIDSENTENCE to explain to me why we had to wait an hour to be seated. I understand why it took so long to be seated, that's fine. I just wanted her understand how we felt having to wait for so long. But to interrupt me after I had to wait AN HOUR without FOOD, to give me the same \"your food will be right out\" response and excuses as to why the food was taking so long. I had told her that this was unacceptable and she tells me in this disrespectful tone \"What do you want me to do? Cancel the order? Bring out more bread?\"          First of all, if you have to ask the guest what you want her to do, then you should not be the manager.         Second, are you implying that you want me to cancel the order? Are you challenging me that I won't? The amount of disrespect was appalling. Why? Because we were a younger group of guest in their early 20s? That's another thing I noticed. This establishment seems to favor guests of an older crowd and seems to treat younger guests like children.  I felt like she was belittling me for voicing my opinion against this terrible experience.             Third, please don't offer me more bread when I've been waiting a whole hour for real food. It made me feel as though it would take even longer for the food to come out.              We ended up leaving the restaurant without eating dinner. Mainly because of how that manager was speaking to me. If this \"manager\" knew how to talk to a distraught guest, we would have given them our business. But this manager's disrespectful tone was the last straw.               I'm sure the food would have been delicious if it had gotten to us in time. I felt bad for our servers for being embarrassed do to a kitchen error. They were respectful and kind, but the manager was disrespectful despite her apologizing.               It's not the mistakes, but how they are corrected that matters. And this \"manager\" never learned that lesson.",

    "text": "My husband and I dined here this past weekend before going to see \"O\" while in town. He had been once before with a group in the private room and raved about the whole experience so I was excited to try it.   The ambiance and decor is absolutely stunning, as was the view of the fountain. Super romantic and very elegant. We actually had the same server (initially) that my husband had previously but my husband remembered him because he provided such great service. I believe his name was Danny. We picked out a bottle of wine and perused the menu. After we ordered the wine, we placed our order with someone entirely different, he did not introduce himself other than to say 'I'm Danny's assistant' when we looked at him with confusion. Ok fine- they are busy so makes sense. But we literally never saw Danny again at our table. My husband and I both assumed it was because we ordered a moderately priced bottle of wine and as soon as we were labeled as not big spenders we were ignored. Just because I'm not spending thousands of dollars here does that mean I don't deserve excellent service?? Don't get me wrong, the assistant was very nice but it just wasn't the same experience.   Our food was very good - I'd say 4 stars. Started with the hamachi which was divine. Then we each had the butternut squash soup which was just ok. Kind of bland and very stingy on the mushrooms. It came with maybe 4 mushroom slices when that was listed as a key ingredient on the menu?? I ordered the filet (wish they offered a petite version) which was well executed but not the best I've had. My husband had the dry aged rib eye and he loved it. We also tried the brussel sprouts and mushroom sides. Be warned - the brussel sprouts come with potatoes even though it's not listed on the menu. We don't eat potatoes and would not have ordered them if we had known. Mushrooms were delicious.   My biggest issue wasn't the service snub or the fact that we have had better steak for less money. It was overall service. Only one word to describe it: GLACIAL. Our food took FOREVER. After we ordered we looked around and noticed that no one in sight had food in front of them. That's a scary sign. Our appetizer took 45 minutes to come out. It was 5 slices of raw fish. What takes so long?!? Finally at 9:20 I had to inform our server (Danny's assistant) that we needed to leave by 9:45 at the very latest to catch the show. He had a look of panic on his face but said sure he'd do what he could. Our steaks came quickly after that and we did leave on time so I appreciate the efforts made but we were so rushed we didn't get a chance to enjoy our expensive meal or finish our wine. Instead of it being romantic it gave us a slight bit of anxiety. My husband didn't even try the sides because he didn't have time.   I wouldn't advise people not to go, but if you do just plan to make it a 3 hour event.",

    "text": "We went here last night for dinner. This place is the essence of fine dining, so dress the part and definitely be prepared to spend some money. We chose this place based on the fact that it had great reviews and it had outdoor patio seating right on Bellagio lake, so we could be RIGHT in front of the fountain show.  We went there around 7:15 and were seated almost immediately. First we stopped by the bar to get ourselves two dirty gin martinis. They offer blue cheese olives which is a HUGE plus in my book. However, the martinis for $17 each and not blowing my mind is what disappointed me. But hey, that's why I always order extra olive juice on the side. We were seated right next to fence leading out into the water of the lake. We had about 2-3 people taking care of us. All of them were very attentive and useful for helping us decide what to order.  For an appetizer we got the steak tartar and carpaccio with an aioli sauce. HOLY MOLY was this orgasmic in my mouth. Extremely fresh and decadent! A must order! For dinner I got the sea bass. My boyfriend got the rare filet mignon (on the bone!! Something I've never seen before) and a side of mashed/whipped potatoes. The portion sizes were EXTREMELY generous, which made the prices (around $80-90 for the filet and $44 for the sea bass) worth it. The filet came with some sauces that I wasn't really a fan of for steak purposes, but I could definitely see them being great with other kinds of food. However, nothing could compare to the merlot reduction sauce we had at mon ami Gabi the night before. The mash potatoes were out of this world, and I'm not particularly a mashed potato fan. Dessert was surprise birthday treat. Some lava brownie with ice cream and a fudge decorated concoction with \"happy birthday\" and a candle. Very tasteful but couldn't be finished after our exquisite dinner.  Throughout the meal we were amazed by the spectacular fountain show. At times we could actually feel the water mist. Just like the night before, the Vegas sunset during an outdoor dinner is beautiful. We watched the sky light dimmer down as the surrounding building lights slowly light up. However, I must say that if you end up dining indoors, you won't be disappointed. The decor is made of deep and light blues. It's quite magnificent.  All of the staff are professional and eager to please. You can tell by looking at the menu and tasting the food that chef has put A LOT of thought into the menu and likely makes a great effort to use he finest and freshest ingredients. Our main server, Paul or Kevin I want to say, was extremely useful and refreshingly honest in helping us decide what to order. He didn't try to push us into buying the most expensive items or getting more than we wanted. Also, I want to say thank you to the gentleman who actually walked me to the bathroom and opened the door for me, so I wasn't wondering around like a lost puppy, HAHA!  The only reason I don't give this place a full five stars is because of the prices. Although the portions are quite generous, I've experienced other amazing quality food and service at other steakhouses in other expensive cities like New York and DC, and haven't seen prices THIS high. However, Prime is an indulgence nonetheless, and there's no doubt in my mind that you won't walk away extremely happy with your experience there.  Overall,  I'm a very pleased customer. Last but not least, if you're an M Life member like me, just give them your M life member card when you get your check, and you'll be able to add points to your M life account...so your expensive indulgence will probably benefit towards a comp later :) ENJOY!",

    "text": "We just held our wedding reception at Prime on the private patio overlooking the fountains.  What an amazing experience.  EVERY single guest was in awe of how amazing the experience was and two of our friends even said it was in the top 3 of all weddings they've been to and that  they want their daughter to have her reception there when she gets married.  Rebecca and April (the events Managers with whom we worked for months leading up the event) were on top of everything.  Like any couple right before our wedding we were nervous and worried about everything being perfect.  Rebecca met us on site the day before and she guaranteed everything would be perfect.  She delivered on that guarantee.  The food was amazing, flowers beautiful and our wedding cake was so delicious -- the wait staff could not be beat by any other I have ever experienced.  They catered to our every whim and that of our guests with no hesitation.    The Bellagio fountain show kept our guests in awe every 15 minutes right behind us.  It was like having front row seats to one of Vegas' best shows every quarter hour.  Best part was the value we got for the price we paid -- was so fair especially for such an elegant experience.  I am a tough critic as a corporate executive for an international company that hosts dinner events monthly, I am very picky about venues and quality.  I would never hesitate about referring family and friends to Rebecca and April.  I didn't expect it, but Rebecca was onsite when we arrived -- she greeted us at the door and was the first to congratulate us.  She wanted to make sure everything was set up -- not one detail was missed and we had given them a lot of little touches we wanted personally added for our guests.",

    "text": "One of the top five meals I have EVER had in my life.  My friend has eaten here before and he wanted me to experience this amazing restaurant.  We had a nice table off to the side with a partial view of the fountains.  Since it was my first time at the restaurant my friend let me have the chair with the view.  We decided to share our plates. 1.  Steak Tartare:  This was the main reason why I came.  It was magical.  The punch of flavors was amazing.  You pick up different flavors all over your palette.   2.  Crab Cake:  The subtle flavor of the crab was allowed to shine.  The spice was just right to add to and not take away from the crab.   3.  Beat and Goat Cheese Salad:  This was the only item all night that I liked, but wasn't blown away by.  The quinoa and pumpkins seeds were not my favorite. 4.  Peppercorn Rib Eye:  We both loved the Rib Eye, but we agreed that the next time we come we would opt to get something else.  We felt the peppercorn wasn't needed on such amazing cuts of steak.   5.  Veal Chop:  Best veal I have ver had.  The meat was perfectly cooked and juicy.  The meat was outstanding on its own.  It didn't really need the rich sauce that accompanied the meat.   6.  Cream Spinach:  Excellent 7.  Truffle Potato Gnocchi:  Flavor overload!  Incredibly reach and decadent.   We skipped dessert and opted to have a cappuccino instead.  We ended speaking with a lovely group of ladies at the next table visiting from England and we joined them for coffee.   One thing that I LOVED about this experience - we were not rushed.  We arrived at 9 PM and left the restaurant at 1:20 AM.  We were able to savor every bite and enjoy our company over an amazing meal.  After the restaurant emptied out a bit my friend moved his chair to the other side of the table to see the fountains too.  Wonderful experience.",

    "text": "With Prime's level of snobbery, you'd at least think the chef would season the steaks before cooking...  If you're looking for a standard steakhouse menu set in the palace of Versailles, then Prime is probably for you.  Highlights: The menu is pretty standard fare but it's got all of the staples - steaks, potatoes, French onion soup, shrimp cocktail, creamed spinach etc. The quality of ingredients is very good and the potato dauphinoise were a very tasty side dish option. The wine list is pretty expansive as well.  Low lights: Prime's ambiance is extremely stuffy. The waitstaff does little in the way of making you feel at home and we found our server to be very impatient and overbearing. The ornate setting doesn't really compliment the menu properly, however the panoramic windows in the dining room provide a nice view of the Bellagio's water show. None of our steaks had been seasoned before cooking which is practically a cardinal sin. How would any chef hope to create the perfect crust and flavor profile without a generous helping of salt and black pepper? Seriously disappointing...  If you're staying at the Bellagio and looking for a steak dinner, Prime is a convenient option. Otherwise, go to the absolutely fantastic Carnevino at the Palazzo.",

We started off in the bar and were served by 2 awesome guys...Doug and (not sure other guy's name). Turns out all the bartenders have been here since it opened 13 years ago, so you know they like their jobs and they are happy to chat with you.   2 dirty martinis with blue cheese stuffed olives please! OMG...do NOT miss these olive. 2 more please!  We had requested a special seat for my birthday so we could see the fountains, and even though we had to wait a little bit (2 more please!) it was SO worth it. Best seat in the house!  Miguel was our server and he was so nice and knowledgeable....I loved how he took time to speak with each table and we did not feel rushed or pressured. Here's what we had:  Steak Tartare - a very delicate portion of raw beef with some sort of spicy mayo...very good. I think it was a bit light for 2 people to share though.   French Onion Soup - (BF's starter) Oh wow...super chunky, hot, cheesy deliciousness...this could be a stand-alone meal and in hindsight, it probably was too heavy to have before the steak.   Ceasar Salad - (my starter) Honestly jut ok. Nothing special to the dressing.   Filet - (BF's steak) Cooked a perfect medium rare with just the right amount of searing. So soft you could cut it with a spoon.   Bone-in Filet - (my steak). There's nothing I love more than a bone-in filet. Imagine the juciest, tenderest, mouth-wateringest piece of meat, and then throw extra flavor on top of that from the bone. This was a special that night, and Miguel had to go ask Chef to find me one because they were sold out by the time I ordered. If this is on the menu when you go, do NOT pass it up. Amazing, I'm still slobbering over it.   The only \"ding\" I will give them is that you can't bring in your own wine. We brought a special bottle all the way from CA for my b-day, and they would not let us cork it. I get it, they need to make money, but it seems like they could have bent the rules just this once.   Overall, a fantastic meal. I've been asked if I think it's the best steakhouse in Vegas (that I've been to) and I think it edges out Craftsteak by a margin.   Save your money and try this place!",

    "text": "Ever wondered what the holy grail of steakhouses looks/smells/feels and most of ALL TASTES like? Yes, you guessed it--Jean Georges can do no wrong! Absolutely EVERYTHING from the minute you walk into the restaurant to consume and experience is 10 notches above top notch.  Going through the meal chronologically--   The wine list needs to be tackled by someone with experience or a sommelier. Do not attempt to navigate this if you're a novice!   The freshly made bread basket has a mix of pretzel bread, nut/raisin loaf slices, and an awesome sourdough with room temperature butter that spreads very easily and is of the FRESHEST variety you can get when it comes to tableside bread and butter   Get off your high horse aversion to salads/vegetables and order one of these: *Market Tomatoes -- the Burrata in here can kick the CRAP out of the kind made in most multi century old Italian institutions *PRIME Chopped Vegetables -- a classic that's light enough for you to handle the onslaught main course *Roasted Baby Beets -- the pairing of yogurt, balsamic, and hazelnuts almost belongs in a great brunch place but works well pre-main course   The clear standout in the meat department is the filet mignon. There's no rivaling this steak in terms of the meat itself, cooking technique applied, and balance of seasoning. However, should you choose to order something else: *Roasted Organic Chicken -- the crispy skin, balance of seasoning, and tender meat will send your taste buds to new heights. The unfortunate side effect is that It will forever make you scoff at grocery store roast chicken. *Braised Beef Shortribs -- this could easily fall in anyone's legit list for a last meal dish. Its fatty, juicy, and tender chunks of meat are euphoria inducing. DO NOT hit up a club after this because food coma is absolutely expected!   Side dish standouts: *Ginger Sweet Potatoes -- clearly in a league of its own. This has converted sweet potato and ginger haters alike. *Tempura Battered Onion Rings -- this raises an important question: why don't more places tempura batter? *Glazed Market Mushrooms  -- a nice blend of unique mushrooms (not just garbage white/button mushrooms) in (what tasted like) a red wine reduction   Dessert The Valrhona molten chocolate cake -- the quality of chocolate used here will make you think twice about ordering this anywhere else in the future   Some parting words--give this place the respect it deserves and show up wearing something nice. No doubt your girl will (cause she understands that sorta thing), so you should too. If Yelp allowed 6 stars, Prime should get 7!",

Our server was knowledgable and fun.  Had a great sense of humor... but wasn't annoying.  Was there when you needed him yet not hovering.  The wine selection was spot on.  The seafood tower was to die for.  They gave a very large portion and it was beutifully presented.  The heirloom tomato and burata salad I had was excellent.    I had the braised shortribs.  I also tried many other people's steaks. All fabulous.  The sides were spot on (truffle mashed.... get it!).  Desserts were also amazing.     This place is expensive, yes... but for a special occasion you can't beat it.  The level of service makes the check worth it.  Prime was a great experience overall.  I highly reccommend it.",

I really wanted the Wow factor and didn't get it.  The service was excellent.  The view overlooking the fountains was great.  The food was average. My husband tried the aged bone in rib eye. He said it was good but not better than a regular rib eye he has had elsewhere. I had the salmon.  Again, it was good but that's as far as it goes. The side dishes were tasty although it seemed like there was a lot of salt in everything. $250 for 2 meals, 2 sides and 2 cocktails.",

    "text": "Disappointing.  Was here several years ago and had an outstanding meal.  Visited this week and it unfortunately has taken a big step back and clearly is at best a 2nd or 3rd tier steak place in Vegas.  Location is great and the service was generally good- but the quality of the beef was truly disappointing.  Had an \"aged bone-in rib eye\" that was one of the toughest steaks I've had in the past 12 months.  A steak I would expect at a mass chain for a third of the price.  if you want to enjoy the beautiful setting go here.  But if you are looking for high end beef I would look for a restaurant in the top tier of Vegas steak places which this is clearly no longer in.",

I had the peppered steak and I was afraid it might be too much, but it wasn't. Went great with the sauces provided. Also me and my date shared the sides. We had the truffle mash and asparagus. Both really good as well. It was cold but the patio is heated. Also the view of the Bellagio fountain show was spectacular and set a romantic scene. All the servers were attentive. Myself and my date enjoyed every moment. Nice little perk was the fact that it was a 5 min drive to Zumanity.",

We booked our wedding over two months ago and made a reservation at Prime for the reception right after.  As we made the reservation, we requested a view to the fountain, as this is probably the main reason why people go there. Is right in front of the fountains.   For our surprise, the request was not accommodated and we were placed inside, at the end of the main room. Very disappointing. I will not come back and if you're planning a nice dinner after your wedding or just if you're staying at the Bellagio, don't come here either.  As a note, the manager came to the table to apologize and when he saw I was upset, he was rude and made no effort to try to make out experience better. Shame on them. I will also complaint to the Bellagio management.",

    "text": "I was so excited to have a memorable dining experience with amazing food, great service, and an incredible view, but Prime only managed to come through with the view.    I ordered the bone in ribeye, $75 for an overcooked, forgettable steak.  I ordered it rare and it came out between medium rare and medium, NOT an issue one should have in a restaurant of this caliber.  It did come out with three sauces, two of which I enjoyed, but honestly, with a $75 steak, I don't feel like I should have to dip it in sauce to get some flavor. The steak was pretty bland.  I ordered the carrot cake for dessert. It was absolutely beautifully presented, but I was disappointed that it tasted a lot more like a pineapple cake than a carrot cake. I understand trying to put your own spin on things, but I feel like it lost the essence of what a carrot cake was.  The service was definitely subpar. It took them about 20 minutes after we were seated to even take our order and our drink glasses were regularly empty. Nobody really checked on us to see how our food was, either.  The restaurant is beautiful in the view of the fountains is gorgeous if you happen to be in one of the spots that has a few of them, which we were, but just watch The Fountains outside and you'll probably have just as good of a Time. Super disappointed in this dining experience.",

Our reservation was at 6 but took us at 5:40. We got to see the fountain show 4 times while eating so that made it more perfect for out staycation. Our server was an Asian male with glasses. He was very robotic and didn't smile once. I know it's fine dining but smiling helps. A lot of the work was done for him by his assistants. I figure with all that help you would spend more time with your tables. They forgot my coke not once...but twice...  I loved the food. Can't complain AT ALL. My soy garlic glazed Ny strip was cooked to perfection. On the side I had tempura onion rings. The kitchen cooks very well here. My Favorite part of the meal was the bacon wrapped shrimp. It came with a passion fruit sauce that more than paired well with it and made it more interesting than a normal BBQ sauce that's served with that dish normally. Only negative thing is that the shrimp came with 3 pieces and there was two of us. Spending $28 for one piece of shrimp was a little extreme.   From the host to the server assistants to the fountain show to dinner this place was a hit. The service can be more personable and empathetic.  Manager table touch would have made this night even better. Didn't even see one all night and it wasn't busy. #ComingFromPeopleInTheIndustry",

Went there for a special anniversary dinner, called a day ahead for reservation which was very smooth and easy. We arrived there about five minutes early, were welcomed by a friendly professional host, who immediately took us to our table.  The staff is as high-end as the place and the Bellagio. The ambiance is set great, very lush, classic with a trendy touch.  Price should not be an issue for the diner, it's nothing unexpected for a restaurant of this level.  We had the caviar and seafood assorted platters..which was great. Onto to the mains, we ordered porterhouse and fillet mignon, ending it with creme brulee.  The patio has a one of a kind view on the Bellagio fountains, if you're lucky, you'll view a musical fountains' show.  It's tough to standout when you're in Vegas since the competition is real high, but I recommend Prime for anyone to have a night to remember.",

    "text": "The mother of views and the mother of bills on...Mothers day. Honestly I though I would be blown away. The food is good solid and sometimes wonderful, but nothing made me beg for more. Here we go: Inside is dark as usual, keeping in theme with every expensive restaurant. My theory is people dont want to see each other? Inside is damn depressing: outside seating is a must even if you have to wait. Luckily even with a reservation we only waited 30 minutes when told may be up to 90. Complimentary bread=sadly, CPK, yes Calif pizza kitchen has much better bread.  Excited to see pretzel bread, but quickly extinguished when I felt the texture ( not stale or fresh, kinda like Nicolas Cage movies). The best in there was the sourdough, but none were really warm or crispy.  Which fool dissects comp bread in a food review? This muthafucka right here, take it or leave it. Ok...ordered 4 appetizzies, only 1 was borderline heavenly, and thats the salmon sushi rice cakes. This is a terrific appetizer. The asparagus with mushrooms: great asparagus, mushrooms were too salty. Wedge salad with bacon= standard good, could use more dressing and more bacon instead of just one long strip on top. Crab cake= was pretty good, only ONE for $22 bucks. Most of these are in the 20 to 25 bucks range.  Main dishes: Wife and I had the scallops; they are HUGE I will give them that; 4-5 massive pieces the size of yams. It was quite good but...not the best Ive had. Bok choy was crisp and good (dont like the wilted ends but the roots.) I almost went to tears as 2 giant pieces were left cause we were stuffed, and last night I checked the rooms arent equipped with scallop fridges to take home back to L.A. (too bad)  Son had the lamb chops, there were good....but again not close to the best Ive had or even in the top 5, maybe cracks the 10. Lovely plating and presentation on all dishes however. Fountains...I am over it the first time I saw it like 20 years ago, but if youre into that sorta thing and want to see them so close the mist hits the hairs or your forearms, this is the place. I was distracted by a silver- haired 70's white man and Asian \"night worker\" 20-30 years to the younger engage in deep conversation, not touching their steaks and having 3/4 of each doggie bagged. Bizarre sex props? Hey, its the LV.",

    "text": "We really, really wanted to like Prime Steakhouse.   Located in the Bellagio, with a great view of the Bellagio fountains if you decide to dine out on the patio, the restaurant would appear to be a True gem.   Reading other reviews here on Yelp, we decided it would be a good choice -- and possibly a bit less 'stuffy' than going back to Picasso or Le Cirque.  We wanted a good steak and a bit more relaxed dining experience.  Our meal Sunday, September 2nd was merely OK.  The steaks themselves were nothing special.  We've had much better steaks elsewhere.  If your restaurant name is 'Prime Steakhouse' customers expect a bit more. That being said, the food wasn't the biggest let down of the evening.  As we sat among other diners, things just started going down hill.   Everyone seated outside was treated to one of the guests proceeding to LOUDLY facetime their family and have a lengthy conversation.  Way to break an initial romantic dinner watching the Bellagio fountains.  That's the most minor quip, since that is somewhat outside the control of Prime service staff (though, really, could it hurt to politely request a customer to step outside the restaurant -- not merely 'outside' on the patio to annoy other diners -- if they truly can't wait to have a family Facetime video chat?).  The second item, is the onsite photographer.  As diners attempt to enjoy their meals and ambiance of the fountain show, there's a photographer going table to table requesting couples to have photos taken.  Fine.  Seems a bit low-ball to have a fine dining establishment have a photographer thrust her camera in your face, but I get it.  Some nice, romantic photo options for couples on vacation.  My gripe is how the photographer interaction was for our experience specifically.  So after she gets another couple's photos she asks for ours.  After some hesitation we do it.  As our meal starts to arrive, the photographer then brings photos/photo books for us to select to purchase.  OK, fine. We'll take the memento.  We agree to purchase a photo book.   I pay via credit card through her portable point-of-sale device.  She prints the receipt for me to sign.   On the receipt it has a line for 'Tip'.   It's $45 for the photos, so it seemed perfectly acceptable to add a tip for the photographer for her time and effort.    I add the tip on the tip line and proceed to regret doing so for the next several minutes (I suppose no one does this at Prime given our experience).  The photographer looks at the receipt and tells me I need to initial and write out the tip amount (the dollar amount specific in the TIP line of the receipt evidently isn't self-explanatory) and then initial the receipt.   What?!?!  OK, fine.   I do so.  Not to let it go, the photographer begins to admonish me saying I shouldn't 'change the price' on the receipt. My response is simply that I was attempting to be generous and provide a tip.  I look at the receipt.   Total + Tip = what I input.     I'm far from a mathematical genius but there was no 'change' made to the receipt total.  I simply (and very regretfully) added a tip for the photographer and got several minutes of back and forth.  Evidently she didn't realize until she grabbed the signed/initialed receipt that I actually filled it out correctly.   She thought the '$' sign on tip line was me 'changing' the total she would get for the photographs.  What?!?!?  Obviously no one else ever gives a tip as it's pretty straight forward grammar school math.   Ugh.  Thanks for wasting our time at what we hoped would be a lovely dinner.  The evening was capped off watching the couple at the table in front of us have their Credit Card LOST by the Prime staff.    They just wanted to pay for their meal and move on with their evening when Prime servers returned their bill to sign/fill out -- without the card the customers provided.   The couple was pretty calm about it, though they let Prime staff know the inconvenience and obvious concern having to now cancel the card.  The gentleman asked Prime if they could simply verify whether his card had been 'run' through the system so he could at least know whether they lost the card before or after they ran it.  Prime staff couldn't or would't help him.     Watching this, coupled with our own sub-par experience really dampened our night out for dinner.   Food wasn't anything special (steaks were both mediocre at best), photographer hounding us was aggravating, and the staff losing another diner's credit card was pretty shocking to sit and watch (since we were staying at Bellagio, we simply charged the meal to our room as I didn't want them to lose MY card after witnessing what just occurred).      The meal was $495 total for two.  At that price point for two people, the meal should have been exceptional.  Disappointing experience to say the least.",

    "text": "Unbelievable service and food, truly a delight!  I was lucky enough to be included in a business dinner at Prime. The service was incredible. The dining room is dim, but somehow creates the perfect intimate sentence amongst the velvet back drops.  Our party had a seafood tower that had chilled muscles, clams, lobster, shrimp, crabs, you name it! It was all of an extremely high quality and car with 3 excellent sauces. For dinner I had a 10oz. Filet Minon with a side of creamed spinach and brussel sprouts. The sides were split amongst colleagues and there was plenty to share. My steak was cooked a perfect medium and melted on my mouth.   Dining at Prime is an experience. The Belagio fountains outside were a stunning back drop. It is, in a word, divine!",

    "text": "We had a wonderful first time dining experience at Prime over Memorial Day weekend.   We thought the decor was very classy. The dim lighting set a very relaxing mood. The wait staff worked together like a fine oiled machine. Every detail of the dinner was executed with precision.   We ordered the Crispy Salmon Sushi as an appetizer, wedge salad, and market tomatoes for starters. They were absolutely delish! If you love garden tomatoes, you'll love the market tomatoes with burrata cheese. Our filet steaks came out perfectly cooked and were succulent and tender. For sides, we had the truffle mashed potatoes and broccoli jalapeno cheddar. The sides are perfect for sharing and did not disappoint. Three types of sauces for the steaks were also served. We thought that was spectacular as we got to try all three. Although the steak itself was so tasty you could eat it with no sauce at all.  I had two cosmo martinis which were perfectly crafted. I'm always looking for the perfect cosmo and they were one of the few that got it right.  Our dining experience was truly 5 star experience! The only suggestion I could make, is to offer a petite filet. I could not eat 9 oz of steak. 3 oz basically went to waste as we were staying at a hotel and had no way of keeping it or heating it up.",

    "text": "So let me start by saying the Bellagio is awesome and everything about it is great.  Prime is no different...great atmosphere and good food.  But the service was just ok.  We waited a long time to order and everything just seemed to drag on.  For 2 people it took us 2 and a half hours for our meal.  Way too long.    I had the short rib and it was to die for.  The house sauce was insanely good and the dish was cooked to perfection.  My guest had a filet and said it was a 7 out of 10.  My main complaint was that it's just too expensive.  I'm not a cheap guy and regularly drop $100 on dinner (for myself).  But this was outrageous for what you experienced.  Our bill totaled close to $350 and we had one bourbon each.  There are better places to drop that coin.",

    "text": "While I can say only excellent things about Yellowtail, a fantastic restaurant also located in the Bellagio, I can't unfortunately say the same for Prime, this time around.  I've had excellent experiences at Prime before so I expected nothing different, however this time, this past Wednesday, I couldn't decide what was worse, the service or the food.  Maybe they were both equally bad.  My drink wasn't filled for almost 20 minutes, and I had to ask and then it took another 10 minutes for it to arrive, then I ordered another, and same story...no one asked us how our food was, the waiter was busy doing something else unfortunately and the people at the table next to us was also waiting and waiting.  The NY Strip w/Soy looked great, but I actually had to change knives from the first steak knife they gave me, to a different stronger one because the meat was so poorly preapred, it was tough and I barely ate 1/2 of it and then gave up.  The sea bass my buddy ordered was also over powered by the sauce it came with, another less than appetizing meal.    On a positive note, Yellowtail, I would highly recommend...ate there twice this trip and both times the service and food, as usual, was flawless.  I hope Bellagio fixes these types of issues at Prime, I have had good experiences there in the past, but I don't know if I'll visit it on my next trip.",

I was a little skeptical of Prime because I've been to the other restaurants on the Bellagio waters, and they were nothing to write home about.    We were seated outside, overlooking the fountains.  The dry-aged ribeye was a party.  My wife and I were trying to figure out what made each bite so good, but at the end, we came to the conclusion that it was just damn good.  I've had Mortons, Flemings, etc. and this steak ranks higher than those places.    The wife ordered the Chilean seabass, and it was just alright.   The fish was flakey, but there was not much taste.    I'm comfortable giving this place a 5, even with the mediocre fish, because our dining experience was everything we hoped for.",

Cons: wine prices at about 1000% markups. Wine list prices are for high rollers who don't pay directly but you do. A \"reasonable\" bottle suggested for only $116 is a Cabernet with the Bellagio name on it. Vile is an understatement. No good restaurant would have this bitter mouth wash on its wine list. It was sent back. Finally ordered with sommelier help a $100 bottle that was ,at best, acceptable. They allow people who know zilch about wine to take your order and make recommendations. really unacceptable. Then again, this is Vegas, a place with absolutely no class unless it is no class. This restaurant is a perfect example, in my view, of why Michelin stopped rating Las Vegas restaurants. There are simply no restaurants in LV, especially the big French names, deserving of the old Michelin ratings, not even the forks.   The place is slightly understaffed and really understaffed with professionals. We ordered a sushi dish as an appetizer. Really bad, the crust tasted like cardboard, could not find a Sushi taste with the fruit like pilings on this thing. It also went back. A $14 piece of fruited cheesecake was good, a value here. Service was good but not up to the price level. They should send their entire staff to Taillevent or the old Jamin for lessons. But why bother when most of the sheep accept whatever they are given.",

    "text": "This review is longgg overdue! Visited Prime Steakhouse on Valentine's Day. My boyfriend made reservations a month in advance to celebrate both the holiday and our two year anniversary. I couldn't have asked for a more romantic and beautiful setting to celebrate these special occasions! Prime Steakhouse at the Bellagio was truly a wonderful experience.  First off, the ambiance. Breathtaking. The inside of the restaurant is dim and decorated beautifully. Glass windows gives you and incredible view of the fountains and of the rest of the city lights. Dress code is formal, so ladies, make sure to put on a nice dress and your sexiest heels, and men, a dressy shirt and tie is suggested. Seating indoors seemed great, but my boyfriend had reserved a table for us outside on the balcony/patio. Wow! That's all I gotta say. You are sitting right by the water, where the Bellagio fountain show takes place every 15 minutes. This was truly and amazing and breathtaking view! Your table is under heat lamps so being cold is not an issue, and it's also decorated w a candles to set the mood. Very romantic! Would definitely recommend trying to reserve this section. Holds about 5-6 tables.  Now to the food, delicious! We started off by ordering the shrimp cocktail, served over a bed of ice with wasabi and its cocktail sauce. So good! The shrimp is cold and fresh and definitely very tasty. My boyfriend ordered the filet mignon and loved it! He said it was cooked just right and the sauces it comes with adds the perfect touch to it. I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken, comes with white asparagus and lemon basil butter. It was good, but very big! Such a huge dish! I couldn't finish it and left a little more than half in my plate. Very filling because of its size. Order if you're hungry or maybe share it with someone. Huge!   We also ordered the truffle mashed potatoes to share. Mouthwatering. The mashed potatoes literally melt in your mouth and the truffle oil tasted so good! A definite side you must order!   As for drinks, we each had a cocktail, which I believe was called the Jasmine. So good. Very light and refreshing, great for a lightweight like me. :) I had 2 glasses!   Dessert was a must! We had a chocolate souffle cake that came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Of course we finished it all! Amazing!  I really loved this place! If you are looking for a classy, romantic night out, Prime is the place to be! We even saw a guy propose to his girlfriend during the fountain show! So beautiful!   Reservations are very easy by either calling the restaurant or booking online through Opentable. Hope you enjoy the restaurant as much as my boyfriend and I did!",

Our group started with the seafood tower as an appetizer and we were all going ga-ga over it. The crab legs, lobster, shrimp, and oysters were all fantastic. FYI, you can choose how many people you want to order it for because it does come with a ton of seafood. For example, our group size was 12 people but we only ordered the seafood platter for 5 and it was still enough for all of us.   My favorite dish of the entire night was surprisingly the Market Tomatoes which contained burrata cheese, arugula, balsamic vinegar & basil. This was truly heavenly. I've already been craving it multiple times.   For my entree, a colleague and I shared the Dry Aged Bone-In Ribeye. This was wonderful and cooked to perfection - ordered medium.   Dessert was also delectable, order the donuts or bread pudding. You won't be disappointed. Wow, now I'm wanting to relive that meal over again. Go enjoy it for yourself!",

Our server was very helpful and brought out a wine list. I ordered a delicious bottle of cab!  I took a look at the menu and lamb chops were crying out for me! So I had to! HANDS DOWN. The best lamb chop I've had. MELT IN YOUR MOUTH GOODNESS!    I couldn't pass up on deserts! CRACKLING KEY LIME PIE. Mmmm.. it was so fun to eat! Every bite crackled in your mouth because of the pop rock candy they sprinkled on the top. The key lime pie tart level was JUST RIGHT.  Such a wonderful medley!   I can't wait to come back!

He was told that they wouldn't let him in dressed this way. We get to the restaurant and they not only were letting men in with jeans, but they let someone in with torn jeans a an T-shirt!  We waited 25 minutes for a table we reserved. I ordered the Soy garlic New York strip steak. Another friend ordered the bone in ribeye, two ordered lamb chops.  Both ladies who ordered the chops sent them back. They messed up the order on the lambs chops.  Both ladies said they weren't good at all.  The lady who ordered the bone in ribeye asked for the manager.  They entire price of beef was 80% fat.  As far as my steak, it was horrible.  It was so tough I couldn't even chew it. $65+ dollars on a piece of meat that I wouldn't give to my dog. I didn't complain.  I honestly can't do that....  we have had steaks from Costco WAY WAY better than this!  I wouldn't waste time and money on this place. You can get a better steak down the strip at one of those $7.77 places. So so disappointed.",

Medium rare fillet took almost an hour, and arrived medium well. I sent it back because I refuse to pay $70 for a poorly cooked steak. I asked for assistance with wine and apparently there is no Somme. My waiter just pointed to other wines and said this one is good. I was willing to spend hundreds on a bottle of wine but that shook my confidence so I went with what I knew. There was a crazy amount of salt in the potatoes and all of the sauces. Even after sending two dishes back no manager ever checked in with us. This place is a high end tourist trap that does not focus on quality. Avoid.",

My husband  was completely silent as he inhaled his  French onion soup.  Afterwards, he had a huge Kool Aid smile.  The salmon,  NY steak, mac and cheese,  truffled potatoes, and chocolate cake were all stellar.   The view was extraordinary!

The steaks are super well aged meats and always cooked to perfection. I have eaten here 10-12 times and ordered something different each time. It has always been great. They have a huge seafood platter served as an appetizer. Its HUGE and has oysters, mussels, large prawns, lobster, and some other fish varieties. It serves the whole table as an appetizer from 2 to 10 people and is incredible.  Highly recomment you stay away from the buffets for one night and check Prime out.",

He also recommended a DELICIOUS Cabernet to pair with our steak (not TOO expensive either).  We started with the crab cakes which was heaven in my mouth.  Even the complimentary bread & butter was epic! I ordered the Filet Mignon, Onion Rings, Truffle Mashed Potatoes, Potato Gratin and corn.  ALLLLLL amazing. My favorite were the truffle mashed potatoes if I HAD to choose one.  They brought me a complimentary chocolate cake for my bday which was so nice :) We also ordered a creme brulee & coffee.  All were delicious. Finally, our server brought us free tickets for the Bank nightclub, where we went after we saw \"O.\" Must say...great weekend at the Bellagio.  Will definitely come back for the next special occasion :)",

I will not let the little blue tiffany's box on the table cloud my judgement of Prime :)  Since the BF 'knows' people, the chef came out and greeted us at what had to be the best table in the house, gorgeous views of the Bellagio fountain show.  The Chef then sent us out a Kobe treat he whipped up....oh my.  Kobe on top of Shitakes with a spicy black pepper mustard.  Oh baby!  After that we had the 'fondue', which was delicious but quirky as I didn't get a little pot of cheese but rather a eggroll looking - cheesy treat  BF got the surf n turf :)  Filet and Lobster, I just got the Filet.  Was cooked perfectly and so tasty.  I do recommend trying your steak naked before tasting all their great sauces - it is mighty good naked.  We tried the mushrooms and Spicy Mac&amp;Cheese for our sides.  I fell in love with the Mac&amp;Cheese and BF is now on a hunt for the recipe.  At the end we were surprised with a lava cake and homemade icecream...what a treat.  Would definitely come back - everything was delightful.  Food, Service and Atmosphere.",

I had the peppercorn New York striploin and my friend had the rib eye. Both steaks were cooked very well and tasted good, however the cuts could've been better. The rib eye was very fatty and my New York was a little on the tough side. They were still very good steaks just for the price I expected a little more. The sides we had were good as well (mushrooms, broccoli and truffle mashed potatoes) but again, not as spectacular as I hoped. The service was very attentive but everyone there seemed to be on autopilot. Almost like they were paid to take care of your every need yet stay invisible. But maybe that's what the crowd they cater to is looking for. All in all not a bad place but for the price I would head to Heritage Steak at the Mirage instead.",

Here's the problem I have when I go to a high end steak joint: you reach a point where the quality of the steak reaches its zenith and you're basically paying extra for the ambiance and service. If you're going to take my money, by all means, please work for it!   Maybe it's just me, but I like it when the person waiting on my table is knowledgeable about the different cuts of meat. Yea, I already know all the good stuff, and I know what I'm going to order, but I find it entertaining when they go through the menu with me. Anyone off the street can stroke my ego and say, \"excellent choice, Sir\".   Very good steak but I've had better (with a better experience) at other places.   And served with steak sauces? No no no no no no nooooo, please, that's a straight up sin in my book.",

I knew it was a long shot but I figured it couldn't hurt to request it. When we arrived they did have a patio table for us and it was an amazing experience. They start you off with a bread basket that has this delicious pretzel bread. It is so good! We had the bacon wrapped shrimp appetizer and they were fantastic. But the best part of my meal was the truffle mashed potatoes! Best mashed potatoes of my life hands down! They were out of this world! I also got the New York Steak and it was very good. The service was wonderful and the view from the patio watching the fountain show was something I will never forget. Can't wait to come back on our next trip to Vegas!",

We got a table in the back of the restuarant in between the kitchen entrance and the bathroom. Not very happy about that but I guess thats what I get for making a late reservation.  There was three of us and we all kind of shared our meals. Caesar salad to start. BOO this was the worst part of the meal. I felt like the salad wasnt freshly tossed in the dressing, but was sitting there getting soggy and unpleasant.   We ordered the porterhouse, filet, and off the menu a bone in filet. All cooked to a perfect medium rare.   The bone in really took our breath's away. At $70 it damn well better! The other two steaks were very good as well. Nice cuts and cooked to perfection.  We ordered the mac n cheese. It was good but I have had better.  Also the broccoli with cheddar. Not that great. something about cheddar cheese to me just makes a meal cheap.   Overall, it was a great meal and great service. We didnt have any wine with dinner but their list is very impressive.   Make sure you call a head of time and request a table with a view of the fountains as that as truly a special event to see during dinner.",

    "text": "This was a splurge for hubby and I's 15th wedding anniversary. We sat outside on the patio which was amazing for me, but I really love the fountains. Even though we had reservations two weeks in advance, we were told it might be about twenty minutes(we got there about 10 minutes before our reservation). Which is fine, I know there are limited seats outside and people will stay and chat. When we were first seated, it took our waiter a good five minutes to ask us what we wanted to drink. It took probably 8-10 minutes to get bread to our table.   Not a great start!  We were decided what we wanted to order and sat there for another 10 minutes or so before our waiter came back and yes, our menus were closed on the table that whole time.  Our appetizer came fairly quick but our steaks took quite a while. We had the crab cake which i thought was pretty incredible. We saw a few tables who sat down after us get their food much quicker then we did.  Whatever, though, it was our anniversary and we had a great view of the fountains. I ordered a medium 18 oz t bone steak which ended up being more rare then I would like, and hubbies medium rare porterhouse steak looked medium. Steaks were tough to cut with the knife provided but melted n your mouth. It was delicious, as was the sauces they provided.  Our water glasses never went empty and that really was the only attentive service we received.  We were asked if we wanted coffee, which I replied yes, along with a dessert menu.  We got our menus right away and it took at least 20 minutes for someone to take our order.  When the waiter took our order, it was another 20 minutes before we got our creme brulee.  The waiter simply forgot because I looked up at him when he walked by our table and the look on his face was one of oh s*&^% forgot their desert.  He did apologize and since it was our anniversary, it was complimentary.  I was in great company but the amount of tip left on our bill reflected our dissatisfaction with our service.  Our total was $192 for the crab cake appetizer, two steaks, two baked potatoes, and some coffee.  Just a warning, they do allow smoking as it is outside, which can be not so pleasant when the smoke is blowing in your direction.  We also had a rowdy group at the table next to us who were quite loud and obnoxious but I understand the restaurant wouldn't want to lose a customer.  We had to ask for our check, as did everyone around us, so I guess that is not unusual.  For the ambiance, and hubby's company it was an enjoyable evening. I loved being so close to the fountains and enjoying them go off every 15 minutes.  We never got any spray and it was a bit windy while we were there.  If we decide to go to a high end restaurant for our next anniversary, we will probably check out another place.",

The decor like the previous person mentioned is phenomenal.  A look out the window has you looking out to the lake / water show.

One of our party is vegan and the fact that a steakhouse had a special vegan/vegetarian menu available was really awesome. The others in our party enjoyed the sea bass, short ribs and bone in rib eye. All the dishes were fantastic. Mushrooms as a side dish were terrific. As we enjoyed our slow paced meal, we also enjoyed the wonderful Bellagio fountains and music every 15 minutes- a highlight of the dinner for me! We were never rushed so they could turn our table and we sat there for dinner and dessert until 10pm. Dessert was a cinnamon bread pudding presented inside a chocolate sphere over which a warm caramel sauce is poured, melting the chocolate. It was amazing. This is a place for a special meal!",

If you look past the high class attitude of the staff you see True elegance and fine dining.  Our experience started off with a long wait due to a mix up with the reservation, good opportunity people watch and checkout the fountains.  They later made up for the botched reservations, but still annoying.  Very crowded for fall weekend night and the sure sign they over booked was the sight of the staff rolling out tables to setup mid evening.  Steaks are surely prime cut and the kitchen really knows their stuff.  Head waiter was a bit stuffy and kept disappearing on us.  Wife has the Rib Eye, nice and tender, cooked perfectly - rare warm center.  I went off in left field and ordered the Duck - must have been the cocktails that threw me off course (nice stiff drinks $$$).  Was expecting something different but after mulling it over a few days, came to the conclusion that it was a spectacular dish.  Hearty breast fillet that cut like a steak, cooked perfectly.  The almond crust was like candy and the red wine amaretto reduction was paired perfectly.  For the sides, the table shared the Truffle Mashed potatoes, Mac and Cheese, Roasted Mushrooms, Roasted Broccoli, and Crunchy Potatoes.  Mac and cheese seemed to be everyone's fav but it had too much depth (if there is such a thing) for me, if you like sharp cheese this one is for you.  The crunchy potatoes has a great name but in the end was just a deep fried baked potato.  The truffle mashed was nice and creamy.  The roasted vegetables were surprisingly good, the broccoli has some heat with the jalepenos.  All in all a good experience, will definitely order steak next time!",

When I informed the hostess that it was my friend's first time in the Bellagio and her first meal in vegas, she went out of her way to get us a table next to the glass windows overlooking Lake Bellagio and the dancing fountains.  The interior of this place is gorgeous.  Silver meets blue meets creme.  Gorgeous, unusual color scheme.  Intimate lighting.    The first time I went I was a vegetarian who still enjoyed seafood, so I had seafood, flown in that morning from Alaska.  The seafood sampler I had for an appetizer was varied and fresh!  The New York Peppercorn Strip Steak I've had the last two times rocks -  The seasoning is well done and the steak is moist.    Our waiter also rattled off all the ingredients in the sauces as well as brought all of them out so there was no having to pick and choose.    My partner in crime, a connoisseur who literally travels the country/world in search of quality steak, considers this one of his favorites simply for that reason.    And yes, the truffle mashed potatoes are indeed yummy.",

We had issues checking into our room and we could not make it to our reservation on time.  I called them and asked if I could push my reservations back about an hour.  The gal on the phone sounded a bit hesitant but said she would push it back but there was going to be a wait.  When we arrived we were greeted by a friendly host who said our table was ready and it was on the patio were we wanted to sit.  It was a great way to start off the dinner.  Our server was attentive but never interrupted us at the wrong time.  Not sure how they could have improved their service.  Food  5/5  My wife ordered the filet and I ordered the lamb with a side of brussel sprouts.  Our meet was cooked just right and we did not have to wait long for our food.     Sorry I don't have any photos to post, I was too busy enjoying my dinner and view to think about pulling my phone out.  I would definitely go back again and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to have a fine dinning experience with an awesome view.",

Was it worth it? More to come.  Food was spectacular! They brought three sauces to enhance a ribeye. The bernaise was on par.  Yes, meal was worth the price.",

We had a reservation and requested outdoor seating but the patio was full so we were offered indoor seating or to wait at the bar until something opened on the patio. We chose the latter. I had a cocktail while we waited. The bartender was nice and was very generous with his pour which was a happy surprise for me! After my drink we were seated on the patio and that began a delicious dinner. I had the mushroom crusted salmon with truffle potatoes and it was wonderful!!! Beware the fountains are loud but the view is well worth it! Because it was my birthday, the restaurant treated me to a chocolate truffle dessert it was a pleasant surprise and very tasty!!! The only reason why I gave Prime 4 stars instead of 5 is because the patio had overhead heaters and was uncomfortably warm! The only breeze was when someone would open the door to enter/exit and we felt the air conditioner from inside. The is Las Vegas in the summertime... no additional heat required!!!!",

    "text": "An annual update from my 5 star review from 1 year ago.  We came back as we had a near perfect $400 dinner last year for our 45th wedding anniversary. Unfortunately this year was not a repeat.   Here is the blow by blow... 1. My wife discovered the bathroom had no soap... mind you this was at first opening.  2. Service.  We were the first table seated, and was done so immediately at opening. Water and menus presented at seating.  After that the waiter disappeared for an extended time. Other guests had their orders taken quickly. In terms of service, our entrees came out about 20 minutes behind other guests... remember, we were literally the first ones seated. I finally had to ask about the status? Generically, the attention vs last year was night and day different. 3. Food: my wife had a Parmesan chicken dish., like last year. Presentation was AMAZING. It came with a lemon cream sauce, but the chicken was literally floating in it. She asked for a separate plate to drain off the excess.  The lemon was also a bit overpowering.  Last year I had the filet, but asked for a recommendation on the rib eye. He recommended a dry aged one. It was cooked nicely, but was a bit tough. Personally, I would stick with the filet. I also had the lobster tail, which was delicious, but at $85 was shockingly small. Independently, my wife observed how small it was...seemed at least 1/3 smaller than last year, and more expensive!!! 4. Lastly, my only issue last year, was the refill on a very small coke was another $5 like the first glass..... for 25 cents of soda, you are going to charge me ANOTHER $5? Restaurant responded here last year that they would address with management... I checked... still $5 for a refill.... on a $300 dinner...?? Waiter agreed it did not make sense.  Unfortunately, we will likely be looking for another great Vegas spot to have our 47th anniversary.  Bookmark removed.",

We made reservations, got seated outside with a spectacular view of the Bellagio water show. It was a hot day but when the water show goes on, you actually get a little bit of cool water breeze every now and then.  From beginning to end, this experience was classy AF. Our server was Brandon and he was kind and funny, our kind of dude. He totally entertained our need to take pictures of all of our food (see attached food photos nom nom nom) and cracked little jokes with us when we scarfed down the appetizers.  We ordered the oysters, steak tartare and market tomato salad for our appetizers. So delicious, came out quickly and we finished every bite of it. It all went well with the bottle of bubbly we got (celebrating my birthday!) and soon enough our sided and entrees came out.  The sides: crispy maiitake mushrooms are the BOMB! Be careful because that sauce it comes with is spicy. We were saying the mushrooms taste like Hot Cheetos! (In the best possible way of course!) And the truffle mashed potatoes were heaven. We also got mac'n'cheese as a side which was super yummy as well.   The entrees: my husband got the dry-aged bone-in rib-eye, my sister-in-law got the sea bass and I got the filet mignon. All of them were superb all around and went well with the sauces that came with it to. My filet mignon was tender and perfectly cooked medium rare, the sea bass was seasoned just right and I didn't try my husband's dish but he loved it. It was more than enough food for all of us so we took some home. We finished the night with some creme brulee and special birthday truffles for me!  All in all, a wonderful experience and I would come back again for more special occasions.",

Let me break it down: The scallops were chewy and tasted fishy, the Sea bass was tasteless and the tuna was too salted and slightly spicy.  We had to send the organic chicken back because it was dry.  The second time around it was very tasty but there was no compensation for the shitty first round.  Way too overpriced for the quality of food so either it was a bad night or the people who rate this place 5 stars don't know good fish.  The side dishes were delicious especially the carrots.  For a restaurant priced this high some warm bread would have been nice instead of the cold bread.",

I travel the world and eat at Michelin restaurants with high frequency in the US, EI, Japan, Korea, and China.  These really is something magnificent about Prime.  It is a real guilty pleasure to come to a magnificent steak restaurant that is a tour de force that is everything a steakhouse can be.  I could not brake the Kobe steak because of a bad experience in Osaka.  But I will here next time I'm in town.  The filet and especially the bearnaise sauce were a culinary delight. The bearnaise sauce was literally like floating on air. I recommend them with the Yukon Mashed Potatoes.  It's and explosion, just beautiful.  The honey walnut raisin bread with the French butter and sea salt are NOT to be passed up.  Savor It.  The water they use to jar this bread is perfect.  The caprese is literally the best Iv'e has on the planet.  Seriously stunning.  The shrimp cocktail is incredibly fresh that melts in your mouth.  It is like eating butter.  I also had the cheese cake which is fabulous in its own right.  However, the carrot cake was probably the best soarer I have ever had at a Michelin restaurant.  I'm not joking here.  It is a confection that is topped with an amazing cinnamon sorbet that will literally have you gasping with delight.  Do not miss it.  Honesty I hit all the restarts in Vegas and Prime is a knock out.  The service is on point ant he food is IMMACULATELY PERFECT.",

    "text": "Beautiful restaurant located inside the Bellagio. Overpriced but worth every bite!  My fiance and I came in for a 7 o'clock dinner. Our server was sweet, friendly, attentive and very helpful. He definitely delivered amazing service.  FOR THE HUNGRY ALERT::: If you happen to be extremely hungry (like me), take it easy. Split a baby iceberg lettuce, super tasty, appetizing and good for two.   Our dinner was delicious! especially the 10 oz filet mignon (medium-rare), very juicy and full of flavor. As for sides, yumm! I recommend the truffle mashed potatoes and mac & cheese...to die for! My least favorite side was surprisingly the mushrooms and I loooveee mushrooms!! (they had no flavor).  FYI::: Side portions are small,  I recommend 2-3 sides.  PS::: Don't forget to enjoy your lovely dinner with a full bodied glass of red wine (great selections).",

Without a doubt, the best steak we've ever had.   The restaurant is beautiful and elegant with an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains. It is definitely pricey, but worth every penny. Not only are the food and wines great, but the servers offer exceptional customer service. It is the perfect place for celebrating special occasions or just a nice night out in Vegas!",

    "text": "My husband and I vacationed in Las Vegas for our honeymoon. We made reservations at Prime and couldn't wait to dine at an acclaimed restaurant. While the service we received was excellent and the view on the patio was incredible, the food was subpar. I ordered a medium rare New York Strip. Steak that is cooked beyond medium rare should be a crime. Any decent steakhouse should recognize that. When I received my entree, it looked decent, but once I cut into it I realized it was terribly overcooked. There wasn't a hint of pink throughout the whole cut. It was dry and, quite honestly, a huge waste of money.   Additionally, during one of the fountain shows, an employee of the restaurant stood at the table in front of us through the entire show (and well after). He appeared to be catching up with the group after years of not seeing each other. Regardless of the subject of their conversation, it put a damper on our experience.  I wanted to love this place. However, based on my experience, it appears to be very overrated. Save yourself the trouble - there are countless other places to watch the fountain show and get a better meal in Vegas.",

Apparently there was a computer convention for decan if I spelled it correctly which were for computer hackers . Checking into our hotel they mentioned to us you may not want to use the wifi so to the event this week. We didn't think much of it because we had a full planned weekend.  We hit up the pool to set ourselves up for a great dinner which we were all expecting . Unfortunately that was not the case . We had a party of 6 and our ordered took us about 40 min before it came out. We had spoke with our waiter who was very friendly yet attended to us every 20 minutes . The steak was a bit to rare and more on the colder side . Not sure if they may have forgotten out food but didn't want to make a big deal due to my fiance birthday . I bit the bullet since we were with her friends and didn't want to be difficult .   I  picked this place based on the yelp reviews but I didn't enjoy my steak .... not sure if I'd come back based off my experience . Seems like a lot of the reviews were good here ....",

The decor and view is perfect for a date / upscale environment.  The service was great.  Not only gave excellent recommendations, knew the menu, and they cleaned and refilled drinks quickly before you even have to ask.  Food flowed out nicely.  The tomato salad with burrata was delicious.  I also ordered the sea bass and my hubby ordered the steak.  For dessert we chose the honey crisp apple pie with cinnamon ice cream.  I don't think you can complain about that.  Come in here if you are not worried about spending the money on a nice meal.  It's worth it.",

The medium rare steak was indeed very good, but I've had slightly better. The sides were excellent. We also got dessert (Bread pudding and don't remember the name) both were amazing.

Came here for a friends birthday celebration and we sat at a nice table with a great view of the strip and Bellagio fountains. Started off with drinks of course. I ordered the Prime Car which is made of Zaya rum (my favorite rum!!!) and orange Curacao served up with a sugar rim. It was fabulous, right up my alley, so much that I had a couple more. If you order the perfect gin and tonic, which is tangurey, tonic, cucumber and mint... Be aware that this is served in a wine glass, up with the bottle of fever-tree tonic on the side. This way it will not be watered down.   We had two seafood platters amongst the 7 of us... And we demolished these! It had crab, lobster, oysters, mussels, clams and shrimp! Also came with a few trays of sauces.   I ordered French onion soup, which came out to the table earlier than I expected, but was also taste worthy.   Here comes the steak!!!! Amazing!!! I had the bone in ribeye and there were plenty of filets around the table. A steak is amazing if it doesn't need any additives... And although this needed no additives I just had to try the three sauces they offered on the table. The peppercorns had some spice too them and was my favorite! I had a couple bites of the sea bass too, and although it was good, it wasn't nearly as good as Noodles (restaurant also in Bellagio).   Creamy spinach was a weird flavor to me. Shiitake mushrooms had ALL the flavor.    We ordered blow job shots but really wanted Cinnamon Toast Crunch shots. I advise them to get Rum Chatta at the bar, it's becoming too popular now not to have it.   We had a cake ordered at Jean Phillipe do we didn't order from the Prime dessert menu.   Staff was very attentive; pulling out chairs to sit and collecting our belongings that fell on the floor. I really appreciated all their help. Would definitely come back!",

I arrived ten minutes prior to my guests only to be told by the hostess that my seating request could not be honored.

Prime is located inside and front of the hotel next to the famous water fountain.  Upon going down the escalator to the restaurant, we immediately saw the upscale and classy vibe of the place.  The host was able to seat us on a Saturday evening without a reservation.  Husband and I felt a little under dressed for the establishment and were lucky that they still seated us.  We both ordered the bone-in ribeye, shared creamed spinach and sauteed mushroom sides.  The food came out to be amazing!  Steak was juicy and flavorful.  It came with three pairing sauces and my favorite was the red wine~ It was a yummy!  Portion was so big that we both only ate half of our steak.    Although we didn't sit near the window with the fountain view,  I was still able to see the spectacle.  It was so grand that each time the finale of the fountain erupts, it lit the window area with bright mellow yellow and it was gorgeous.  Recommended: Dates. Business,  Engagement location, Special Night out.  Definitely call for reservation and request a window seat.",

You can sit outside if you wish on the patio.  The seating outside is somewhat limited, so ask for it ahead of time for a better chance of dining outside.  You are ground level with the famous Bellagio fountains, you just can't beat that.  I have tried nearly all of the cuts of beef, and they are always prepared perfectly.  My personal favorite is the New York Strip.   The sides are large enough for two folks to share, at least.  The baked potato could also be shared if you wish.  If you order the baked potato loaded, it will come with plenty of high quality options.   The asparagus is crisp, salty, and buttery... just fantastic.  The mashed potatoes are not the best I have ever had, just not creamy enough for me, although I did not leave any on the table.  The service here is top notch, nothing to worry about there.  You can't go wrong with any of my top four steakhouses in Las Vegas:  1. Prime 2. Cut 3. Jean Georges 4. Bizarre by Jose Andres",

Little things like forgetting water a couple of times, unfriendly interactions, etc. Had a hair in my tomato and burrata salad. Not a big deal just figured they would give me a new, hairless one... Nope the guy pondered at the table for a couple seconds debating if the hair was there or not. After deciding he took the salad back to the kitchen and came back with... An apology? Not a new one?? He asked if I wanted a different salad but if not a complementary dessert would be provided. Nice gesture.... Yeah except I already asked for dessert for my boyfriends birthday with a candle and writing on the plate when I made the reservation...that was forgotten too... The two stars are for the bone-in ribeye and the onion soup. Really bummed we spent a pretty penny and it left more to be desired. Took a doggy bag home for the ribeye and the only thing left in the box was the bone? Not coming back.",

Imagine eating a 5 star steak meal window-side to an eye-level view the Bellagio Fountains. Picture front row access to a one-of-a-kind Bellagio Fountain show and eating as the Fountain goes off every 15 minutes in front of your window. This is an experience at Prime.   Now, mostly everyone has described the food perfectly so I want to focus chat more about the picturesque atmosphere. Yes, the dress code exists so don't plan on coming here unless your dressed to impress. Yes this is the perfect option for a delicious high-end meal (without the cheesy Vegas vibe) and yes, this is probably one of the most fancy restaurants I've ever dined at. I really can't do justice to the restaurant's setting and while it is a little stuffy, it's perfect for a delicious and delightful dining experience.   I can't leave this review without mentioning the food, especially since it was perfectly flawless. The wedge salad has the right amount of dressing with just enough kick and the pretzel bread that comes with the meal is buttery perfection. But let me talk about the real winners of the meal: the sides and the main courses. You know when people say Filet tastes like butter? Well now I know what they mean. I have never tasted anything so tender in my life. The short ribs are so perfectly cooked that you don't need a knife to enjoy it (maybe a little elf magic helped the chefs create these culinary creations!?) Finally, the sides. Oh the sides! Truffle mashed potatoes. They are expensive and come in a very small kettle. However, it's so rich in flavor and butter that it can easily fill up two people, especially with accompanying sides and an entree. The mac 'n cheese is just as delicious. Between those two sides, a salad and an entree, I could easily have called this my last supper and been happily content in life.",

    "text": "Disappointed all around.    The ONLY bright spot was that we were able to nab a patio seat, so the view and the entire spectra of the water show was a major plus. Besides that, everything else was all down hill. We were seated 10 minutes later than my 8:30pm reservation on a busy Friday night.  This is a given and I have no problem with this, considering that we did get the patio seating.  Here are the breakdowns...  Service : There was only 2 servers, that I saw, serving the entire patio floor, of perhaps 8 table or so.  It was difficult to flag a server for help.  For a restaurant of this caliber, I shouldn't have to flag a server, much less wrestle to get their attention. In addition, the delivery of the drinks, the bread, and the food was painfully slow.  If not for the water show at the Bellagio fountain every 15 minutes, I would've thrown my hands in the air long before we received our food.  Food: Our order was taken at about 8:50pm.   Our drinks and bread came at around 9:00pm (10 minutes after the order was taken?)  The 3 different types of bread were all cold and stale, but we were all famished so our party took in what we had. The food came around 9:30pm (40 minutes AFTER our order!!!) It arrived COLD and uninspired.  The cream of spinach was so cold that I could not separate it.  The whole thing lifted from its plate as one whole lump piece. GROSS! None of the food was warm, or hot.  Why the food was left standing for so long is beyond me.  Our party was too tired from our delayed flight in to make an effort to flag a server to let them know of the food quality. The porter house steak was uninspiring and overpriced at best.  The new york steak which was literally covered with peppercorn was so disgusting, that we had to return it for filet mignon...(surprisingly, the exchange only took 5 minutes!) Filet mignon, too, was just bland.  The ahi steak I had was just overpowered by the thick crust, and once again, non inspirational.  Take away its \"PRIME\" location at bellagio, and this steakhouse would've been closed down long ago.  I, for one, will not be returning.",

But before I get into that, here are the positives: It is one of the most beautiful resturants in all of Las Vegas (especially if your fortunate enough to get a good table with a view of the dancing Bellagio fountains). The food is superb, and service is great. The prices are in-line with other high end resturants in Vegas. Now, as for the reason why I did not give it 5 stars: One time, when I made reservations for dinner, the hostess asked me if there was any special occasion that they should be aware of....I said yes, it was my mom's 80th birthday...the hostess then said \"wonderful, I will make a note of it\". When we showed up for dinner they literally gave us the worst table in the resturuant (right near the entrance, with no lake view, and people constantly walking by). There was also no complimentary cake, or anything else, for my mom (not even a \"Happy Birthday\" greeting). Needless to say, I was very disappointed that The Prime did nothing special for her....I am sure it was just an oversight, but I still have to subtract 1 star for that night.",

Definitely a place where \"pretty people\" go to eat/ be seen.  We had a reservation and had to wait for 10-15 minutes, but nothing major.  I cannot give 5 stars because it was not the best steak that I ever had.  For a $62 filet, I was expecting a bigger serving than 10 ounces, but it was very good and cooked properly.  Another member of my party was disappointed in the cooking of his steak, which was ordered rare, but he still ate it and said it was good.  Meat quality wasn't the best and didn't seem to be as good as my favorite Chicago steak joints.  Our server was professional and knew his stuff, even after being questioned on random food details by the foodie member of my party.  He wasn't in our face, but was very attentive and also sent over a free desert for my friends birthday.....no singing thank God!  Would never tell anyone not to go there, but there might be better steak places in Vegas.  Because it's in the Bellagio and has a view of the fountains, can be considered a destination restaurant.",

Our food took an extremely long time, which I can handle if they just let us know, but we got the 'it will just be 2 minutes' about 3 times for a total of 30 minutes (that was after we had already finished appetizers).  The waiter was condescending and snobby, which sucks because I was hoping for a nice night with friends. Was just very disappointed, I would recommend you try somewhere else. If you are going for the view, eat somewhere else and come back to watch the fountain.",

However, the steaks are nothing special.  I had the ribeye, and my date had the filet.  Both were obviously quality cuts of meat, but just nothing that would set either apart from other steakhouses.  I did not appreciate the attitudes of the snooty staff and hostesses.  This place is over-the-top pretentious, which is to be expected, but I just felt like there was an ora that was disgusting.  In Vegas, I've enjoyed Guy Savoy and Joel Robuchon which are other even higher-end restaurants.  There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat.  At Prime, they made it feel as though I should be thankful to be served and seated in such a prim and proper, \"high\" class environment.    Prime is trying to be something that it's not.  This restaurant is located 45 yards from a wheel of fortune slot.  There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.  We're not in Paris folks, we're in Las Vegas- king of the nobody doing his best to act like he's somebody, and paying the credit card price for month's to come (LV is my favorite city in America).  Finally, the $100 seafood appetizer platter was a complete waste.  The oysters were terrible (relative).  Prime needs to lose the attitude, and focus more on special food that matches the price.",

Watching JG & his wife on the show is the reason we had interest in Prime & decided to come and celebrate our V-day weekend dinner out at the Bellagio.  We booked a table through Open Table & requested a table near the windows so we could see the fountain show in the front of the hotel.  You can't hear the music, but you can hear the roar of the water.  We were seated in this smaller dining area, tucked away near the entrance, next to the water & fountains.  It just so happened that night, Carlos Santana was there with 4 other people sitting right behind us.  \"Happy Birthday\" never sounded so good.  As for the food, we started with the salmon & oyster tartar with black bread.  SO GOOD.  The olive oil and light oyster flavors were really good & paired well with the sashimi grade salmon.  We then ordered a salad (fairly large mixed greens salad) & soup (french onion), both good, but could have probably been happier trying another appetizer on the menu instead.  For our main course, we split the Porterhouse, roasted brussel sprouts and crispy potatoes.  My boyfriend likes his steaks cooked medium, bone to edges, the steak was perfect.  One of the dining staff members or \"team 18\" cut our steak for us portioning out half and half onto separate plates for us.  The brussel sprouts were were paired with pork & quince, sweet & savory.  Crispy potatoes, think of a really good potato skin with creme fraiche.  Although we were both stuffed, we couldn't skip out on dessert.  We split the cracking key lime pie.  What made it crackling was that they put in pop rocks into the filling.  Definitely a nice pleasant textural element.  The key lime was very tart and paired well with the whipped cream topping.   Along with our meal, we shared a bottle of Tobin James Zinfandel Reserve.  Their wine list is a huge directory of wines, local and international.  I want to say that the year they brought out for us was different than what was listed in the menu, but I still love that winery so it was an easy no-brainer.  The wine was listed at $65, one of the cheapest, if not the cheapest wine in the directory, but i still love that winery!  Pat on the back JG.. too bad you only go there 3 times a year to check up on the menu.",

    "text": "The drone of hopeful millionaires waned as the six of us dipped into the paneled honeycomb of Bellagio's steakhouse, Prime. We had drifted away from the hoots and hollers of night owls and seemingly onto the set of a high budget film that hadn't decided whether its focus was Old Hollywood, Gone with the Wind or French Victorian. Blue, velvet drapes careened from ceiling to floor, busting from a girdle of gold chords that could easily fashion Scarlett's next dress. Fountains flitted outside the window like children intent on a game of tag and added just enough Disneyland amusement to complete this abstract portrait.   Despite swiveled heads and rubber necks, we arrived at our table unscathed and dwarfed by an immense painting resembling Venus's sister (staring wide-eyed at our plates to ensure we ate all our vegetables). An ocean of carpet, thick enough to swallow any signs of dropped silverware, necessitated \"Alice in Wonderland-like\" gold knockers on the back of each chair for easy towing.   Auditioning for the stereotypical role of \"Jeeves\", our waiter ascended with a raised nostril of disgust (Scene 1: sniffing dirty sweat sock) and upon ordering drinks (Scene 2: serving a stiff cocktail of contention), one of my culinary colleagues murmured, \"I feel like the waiter thinks he's better than me.\"   We laughed, but the apparent exasperation wasn't funny. Jeeves's superiority was stifling from the first wrinkle of his nose to his wafting stench of arrogance, and not only did it lessen our experience, but lowered the overall standard of the restaurant. A True upscale establishment ensures the customer's comfort at all costs and Jeeves couldn't even spare a dime.  Our annoyance was overridden by a dining cart bearing silver orbs of secrecy, each cover lifted and replaced in the edible version of \"find the queen\". My fork first tore at symbiotic landmarks of top grade tuna and avocado wading in ginger/ soy with its light, rejuvenating effects similar to a Fountain of Youth (for the palate). The salad set posed an ordinary looking Caesar like a diminutive wallflower, but beneath his classic cover laid a defined body and final punch of citrus that lifted his status to \"crowd pleaser Caesar\".   Unfortunately, the crispy goat cheese fondue did not rival Caesar for top billing and was a disappointment in concept and taste. This tomb of fondue bandaged goat cheese (head to toe) in a fried, phyllo sarcophagus that trapped the necessary tart-n-creamy catalyst. \"The curse of teeth rotting sweetness\" attacked an unassuming frisee salad with grapes and pear vinaigrette (its pungent antidote only inches away).  The \"meat and greet\" came next with the promise of the protein packed main course that had led us here. My lamb chops, encrusted with chili crumbs, were ordered at medium rare, but arrived closer to rare. Still delectable, I ravaged them, dipping sporadically in the bevy of sauces accompanying the meal (barnaise, spicy pepper, etc.) The steak au poivre was paved with a thick asphalt of peppercorns (not a pothole of naked meat to be seen) with a potency that could remove tar. The tearing and coughing induced by this dish might be used as protection in a dark alley- the original pepper spray.   Two of our other carnivorous constituents ordered the porterhouse- one requesting medium rare and the other medium. A couple bites into the meal, the medium rare \"requestee\" found himself in the middle of medium man's steak. Medium man had already manhandled the \"mis-steak\" placed before him (cooked almost exactly like the other) and munched happily on what he thought to be his order. This was inexcusable- not only did these prices demand perfection (around $50 a steak), but the moniker of \"steakhouse\" insists on the chefs' aptitude for mastering meat temperatures. This was a blunder that couldn't be overlooked as easily as Jeeves's snippy quips and would be the resounding memory of the meal (though thoughts of their lumpy, heavily salted mashed potatoes would be reminisced of fondly).  I could now empathize with Dr. Malfi's attraction to Tony Soprano. I was immediately enamored with this piece of work's over-the-top and muddled alter egos, but inconsistency and a mafia sized payoff eventually marred my fond feelings. As Prime puckered for its \"kiss of death\" in my final farewell, I still admired its larger than life character, but couldn't trust Prime's rep enough to invest that type of dough.",

We had a quaint table in a dining area near a large window so we could see some of the fountain. I started out with the Shrimp cocktail which was 4 large shrimp with cocktail sauce perfectly displayed on a bed of ice with lemon. They were delicious and a perfect appetizer. We both ordered the Caesar salad which was not only delicious but a nice sizable portion. I ordered the filet mignon which was superb and my companion got the dry aged bone in ribeye which he loved. We split the truffled mashed potatoes which were so creamy and delectable and a perfect portion to share. They did give us a nice bread basket with various bread including my favorite pretzel bread. We were too stuffed for dessert. The service was absolutely impeccable and friendly. Would definitely go back. Definitely pricey. Also, I might add there is a dress code which was not necessarily enforced.",

News flash: people that order salmon are usually health conscious individuals that are trying to make a lean and healthy choice, not usually want a stick of butter dropped on in prep. I will say that I ordered the hot chocolate/lava cake with vanilla ice cream and it was amazing! However the coffee that I ordered to go with it was absolutely awful.

Server seemed a little snooty and when asked to customize a salad basically a Caesar with a different dressing seemed very put off. The onion soup was tasty but lukewarm.  Our filets were requested medium but came out undercooked. The fries and onion rings that came out at the same time were cold. Once our steaks returned 5 minutes later  they were cooked appropriately and were very tender and well seasoned. The sever rarely checked on the table. The sauces served with the steaks were very good. If we had not been with a large party I would have sent back our accompaniments to have them at the proper temperature but didn't want to delay the table. Overall a disappointing experience for a highly rated restaurant with a high ticket price.",

Granted, we were a big group of 20-somethings but the place was pretty empty so I don't think a bad attitude was warranted.   I think the theme of the night was quantity over quality. The shellfish platter was full of giant pieces of seafood that tasted like it came out of a freezer/buffet line. The lobster was really rubbery and flavorless, but it was cute that they de-shelled it in front of you. Perhaps I should have gotten steak at a steakhouse (who knew?) The creamed spinach and mashed potatoes were good, but nothing memorable. The creme brulee was really good (isn't it always) and the chocolate volvano souffle was also good.   But i don't think anything would compel me to come back here. Even the deco is stuffy and pretentious. Boys, come here in a suit.",

Despite the fact that everyone at my table ordered the filet, I decided to go with the braised short ribs.  Eh, they were okay, but my mom's filet was to die for. Thats why I only gave 4 stars.

    "text": "I'm so torn on this place. The food - dang good...really really dang nabit good. Service - forget about it. I have to say that the manager and sommalier took care of us at the end when they realized how much of a jerk our server was but it really did leave a bitter taste in my mouth.  3 of us went to this place instead of our usual tried and True Delmonico's at the Venitian. First thing we did was assess our budget. Looking at all the numbers, we figured we could spend just about $500 on our meal. We decided to go food heavy and budget on the wine (well, for this place that meant $100 for wine).   Our server came by and I told him that we were on a wine budget and that we only had about $100 to spend and asked for some suggestions:  me: '...can I find some good dry, full bodied reds for about $100?' jerk: 'If you look HARD enough'  I'm all, are you for real right now? Then he starts going down the wine list (which is huge and pretty darn impressive) and picking out all the ones that are $100 just based on price. So I tell him that I read numbers really well and that what I want is a suggestion.  Then we start ordering and my friend asks if they have lobster tail for the table to share. Jerk says they have small and large sizes even though it's not on the menu and then says he'll be back with the prices. Comes back pretty quickly and says, 'the large is $168 so you guys will probably want to small one if you really want one'. My buddy is pretty pissed at this point and just based on that comment he orders the large. Jerk doesn't let it go and tries to convince my friend to order the small saying stuff like, 'it's better for you to order the small one'. At this point we are all pretty pissed, but it's been over a year since I've seen my friends so we try to brush it off.  The sommalier suggests a VERY nice silver oak for like $108 that turns out to be a really good wine so we're kicking back and enjoying our wine and the appetizers that came out super fast. The crab cakes were very good as well as the stuffed mushrooms. Everything cooked well with great flavors.  The steaks were also on the money. I'm partial to bone-in ribeyes and this one was really really good. Rare-plus is the way to go if you want to full juicy flavor of this bad boy.  I slow down after eating almost half the steak and start wondering where the lobster tail is... I wave down Jerk and and ask him when the lobster is coming and he runs off and comes back and tells me 10 minutes. So I start digging into him why it would take so long and find out the he never put in the order. What's worse, he tried to blame it on my buddy, saying that we weren't sure if we really wanted to order or not and that's when I had enough and went off on the guy. I can be an a$$ at times and this called for all my a$$ness to come out, especially since I was fueled w/ Patron and Silver Oak. I chewed him out and asked for the manager.  Manager finally comes and she apologizes and all that stuff but at that point we were seriously fed up. I mean, I went on a rampage, brought up the service, asked if they were racist, asked if they didn't serve young people, you name it, I accused it.   The only thing that kept us from leaving was that the food was so dang good. I couldn't leave my perfectly cooked bone-in rib. It just didn't seem right. I'm sorry.  We ended up getting the lobster tail right away (delicious), ordered another side (on top of 3 others we ordered) and got 3 desserts. Molten cake - awesome, some italian cookie thingy with icecream in the middle - awesome, creme brulee - good.   At the end I figured we completely blew our budget but the manager came by with the bill and it was far less than about 1/3 of what we should have paid. I think they comped everything but our steaks and appetizers.   Was it worth the price? Not sure. Was it good? Heck yeah. Would I go back? Only if my friend pays again.",

I am giving it three stars on a straight ratings system.  Grading on a curve, using other top-end steakhouses as a reference, I would give it two stars.  The food was good, but not great.  The small lobster tail in my $100+ (DANG!) surf and turf was overcooked.  I've never sent anything back at a nice restaurant before and I rarely send anything back period, but that had to be resolved.  Staff was cool about it and handled it perfectly.  Service was good, but not amazing.  Our waiter was nice enough, but was not allowed to taste the bottle of wine that we brought, which was kind of a drag.  We never even smelled the somalier.  Where the eff was (s)he?  Finally, as we finished dinner and the wildly overpriced Chteau DY'quem, we were asked to move out to the frikken patio!  The restaurant was nowhere near full.    Turns out, however, that last half an hour after dinner was the highlight of the meal:  we got to enjoy the water show, finish our wine and cast occasional glances at TV's own Tom Selleck sitting nearby.  Unlike meals that I have had at other fine establishments, looking back, nothing about Prime (other than the patio scene) stands out to me.  Here's the thing:  when dropping major coin of this sort, I expect to be dazzled.  Good does not cut it.  Prime just didn't dazzle me.",

The water show was just as impressive as it was on PBS's New Years 2000 special, and we kept our table far too long drinking wine and eating a couple of desserts, which is probably why it costs so much to eat there.  There are not a lot of people coming and going...every one stays for a while.  I would recommend Prime Steakhouse to anyone celebrating a special occasion or if you just won the lottery.",

The dining room has a great atmosphere - comfortable arm chairs with dim, romantic lighting - and we were seated at a table with a great view of the Bellagio fountains.  After each ordering a glass of wine, we started with the bacon-wrapped shrimp for an appetizer. I had the 8-oz filet and my wife had the slow-baked salmon and we split the Yukon mashed potatoes. All of the food was fantastic and the service was equally good. They gave us dessert menus, but before we had a chance to order one of the servers brought out their signature lava cake dessert that had \"Happy Anniversary\" written in chocolate sauce...what a great ending to a great meal! When it was all said and done - wine, appetizer, entrees, tax, and tip - the bill came to $200.  If I had to find a complaint for Prime it would be that there were only three shrimp in our appetizer, which was about $20, and that they charged us $8 for water (Fiji).",

    "text": "Was hoping to give this restaurant 4-5 stars being it was Jean-Georges restaurant in Las Vegas.    Dined here with a group of 5 for our last evening in November, looking forward to a memorable A+ dining experience.  Our concierge at another hotel had recommended this restaurant (among others) when we asked for the best steak house in LV.  The indoor atmosphere was luxurious, overlooking the famous Bellagio fountain with a spectacular view.  It was tastefully decorated and the service top notch, unfortunately the dishes we ordered were not. Be prepared, the wine list is extensive, and expensive, but expected of a restaurant of this caliber.  I, and several others, decided to try the Caesar Salad as a starter.  We were stunned such a mediocre salad could be served at such an acclaimed restaurant.  The tired & limp romaine lettuce was thinly chopped with what looked like small store bought croutons, no joke.  The croutons didn't even look house made.  There was no shaved Parmesan or Pandano, just grated cheese throughout.  The taste was lack luster store bought, no wow factor at all.  We all agreed we could find this salad in just about any super market deli, very disappointing. Next, I ordered the peppered New York steak, medium rare, as my second dish.  The steak was over seared on the crust making it very difficult to cut through, like cutting a piece of leather, leaving the steak to be tough and chewy.  I've had much better steak elsewhere for less.  Other diners in our group had similar dishes with less than top notch results.  We were on a show schedule and didn't have time to send back any dishes, so we stuck with what we had.  This dining experience left us thinking that maybe signature restaurants ride too much on the coat tails of outdated reputations, using location and aesthetics to make up for the quality of food served, seemingly over rated.  Not sure if I would spend big bucks to eat here again when there are so many other great restaurants in Las Vegas.",

Our food wasn't bad but it was definitely overpriced.  I guess when I order a steak medium-well I expect it to be slightly pink, not totally gray through and through and on the tough side.  The macaroni and cheese was so sharply cheesy I honestly could not eat it.  The truffle mashed potatoes were too truffly (I didn't think that was possible until Prime). The bread basket was excellent though.   The bar is very small so if you have to wait for a table you're pretty much standing in the foyer.   The hosting staff has an impeccable system for knowing who is next to be seated, what time your reservation is and \"remembering\" your name. This impressed me a great deal.    The waitstaff was good but a bit stuffy.    The room was nicely appointed and appealingly quiet except for a large party that had three very young children with them (all certainly under 5 years old who spent a great deal of time crying and unhappy - why bring children to a restaurant like this?).

After our drink orders were taking, we waited about ten minutes before receiving them, and another ten minutes until a completely different server took our orders. I understand its odd that I venture to steakhouses and don't order meat, but I don't make a fuss over what I eat; so I really didn't understand why the server had to give me a disapproving look when I didn't order a meat item. I wish I was exaggerating with the amount of time between when we would see our server (if at all) but I'm not. Our reservation was at 9:30pm and we left the restaurant close to midnight. Considering that this restaurant has earned a Triple A 4-diamond rating, I assume it solely due to the steaks, chops, and seafood options.   On a happy note, I loved the truffle mashed potatoes! Luckily, we were seated close to a window and as always, any view of the fountains is breath-taking :).",

I took my girlfriend at the time for her birthday here, booked the reservations in advance and told them it was her birthday. The service was great the second we got sat... I had the filet mignon and it was cooked medium rare the way I like it, it was perfect. Desert they brought my gf a cheesecake with a candle and it said Happy Birthday in chocolate on the plate. I was happy knowing I didnt have to remind the server it was her birthday, they were on their best service standards in my opinion and I would love to take another future gf to this establishment soon.",

    "text": "*** 1/2 stars  This is a luxurious looking restaurnat with a view of the Bellagio fountains to boot. We had a beautiful corner table that was cozy and romantic.   The food was excellent traditional steak house fare. We started with some excellent crab cakes for appetizers. Followed by the peppercorn crusted NY strip for me and the bone in filet special for my girlfriend. Both steaks were aged well and flavorful. I have never been a fan of doucing my steak in sauce. However, I have to admit that the miso mustrad was a nice compliment to the steak. Truffle mash was a perfect side. The surprising highlight of the evening was that they has a mille crepe on their menu for dessert. The only time I have had a good rendition of this dessert outside Paris was at Lady M in NYC. Prime's Version gets an A+ from me. Perfectly textured crepes stacked with a layer of cream in between.   The big downer of the evening was the impersonal service. While our waiter was attentive and we were checked on by couple other people over the course of the evening. It just seemed like no one really cared. This might be a contrast to our luxurious experience at Twist the previous night.   I have to take away some points for service. Although, I think I may not be the only one that thinks so. I did notice that this restaurant had a 4 diamond rating, while possesing the makings of a 5 diamond restaurant. It isnow clear to me what type of restaurnat garners that extra star.",

A fantastic experience with great family and friends for my bachelor party weekend.  Truly a memory I will treasure for the rest of my life.  The food was spectacular and so was the bill!

Someone in my group got the steak and it was..just okay. Nothing special. I had been eating red meat a lot so I got the chicken. I love chicken. But they served me a large, flat piece of boneless chicken that was deep fried. I was super confused about the chefs choice in cooking and serving that. It's a nice restaurant for goodness sakes, don't serve fried chicken like that.  I have too many loves in Las Vegas to come back here again.",

    "text": "Primed with a gift card from my son and daughter-in-law to ease the financial outlay required to dine well here, Diane and I at last ventured forth to sample Prime.  And, besides finding it to be the most expensive restaurant we have each visited to date ($330.52 for 2 diners, including tax and tip, but without any alcoholic beverages), even taking into account many renowned restaurants we have frequented at some time or other across the globe, it was without doubt one of the best.  We did not scrimp on food, but did not order that extravagantly either.  After being promptly seated at one of the few booths in the cavernous restaurant as requested in our reservation, with a distant but still good view of the Bellagio Fountains, and immediately receiving black cloth napkins substituted out for the white ones on the table to cover our black pants, we decided to begin with a Shrimp Cocktail app.  After being presented with big shrimps unconventionally lying side by side on a plate, we then enjoyed the great cold and meaty morsels, which I dunked in a fresh and quite tasty Wasabi Cocktail Sauce.  Next for me was a large gargoyle-headed, and seemingly bottomless, white crock of hot and cheesy Prime Onion Soup.  With well-caramelized onions, a very generous supply of clotted Gruyere and Emmentaler Cheeses, and a few chives sprinkled on top, it was a memorable Onion Soup Gratinee that took me awhile to fully consume.  But of course I eventually did, to the last drop!  For our entree we each ordered a medium-rare 10 oz. Filet Mignon.  The tall and long, lightly charred prime-grade steaks yielded buttery, melt in the mouth meat which was quite tasty in its own right, but even better after being joined with a trio of sauces: Soy-Rice Wine Sauce, Peppercorn Sauce, and classic Bearnaise Sauce.  I enjoyed alternating forkfuls of beef with a few drops of the three sauces, and never did determine a clear favorite between the Soy-Rice Wine Sauce and the Bearnaise.  Each was an excellent flavor amplifier of the perfectly cooked beef, as were the Shishito Peppers that accompanied my Filet.  Along with our steaks we split a single wide Crab Leg from South Africa with Drawn Butter at $38.00 a pop.  I had decided in advance that if the one crab leg seemed insufficient, I would order another.  But there was no need.  In fact, because my stomach was quite full, I left 2 ounces of my steak on my plate, uneaten, which is uncharacteristic for me, and which I now regret!    I'm sure that our sides took a toll on our bodies as well, making us very content.  For what is a steak dinner without some fine sides?  And fine sides we had!  Gratin Dauphinois Potatoes were as cheesy and as great as they looked in photos on Yelp.  We reveled in oozing Comte Cheese.  And, Roasted Glazed Market Mushrooms were a quite interesting array of several types of mushrooms, including Enoki.  Each side was easily enough for two diners, and a few mushrooms were also left behind.  Not to be overlooked were the fine slices of complimentary Sourdough Bread and great Raisin Bread with Walnuts served with an elongated slab of butter with some specks of Chive Salt on top.  Initially I thought I had encountered my first slice of salty Sourdough Bread--until I realized that the Chive Salt was causing the sensation of a burst of salt in my mouth.  But I grew to like this, and more Chive Salt Butter was ordered, quickly received, and slathered on more bread.  To finish, Diane enjoyed Warm Valrhona Cake with a molten center and a scoop of Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, while I very much liked my scoop of Chocolate Sorbet specially adorned with a brittle Chocolate Bow.  Service by three attendants was superb.  A request for decaffeinated Iced Tea was responded to with three successive pots of brewed hot decaffeinated Chamomile Tea and Relax Tea made specially for me, and poured over a large glass of ice.  Water glasses were continually filled without any need for a request, and we were regularly visited by a member of our formally clad waitstaff to see if we needed anything.    Our seating in a corner booth was very comfortable.  And the sumptuous decor surrounding us, combined with our window view of rising jets of water from the fountains just outside and the sound of jazzy music piped in overhead, afforded a classy, upscale ambiance that, along with the wonderful food, yielded a luxurious and quite memorable five-star dining experience.        I am going to start saving real soon for our next visit to Prime, and highly recommend this dining experience to all!",

Unfortunately, I forget our servers name but he was really cool and made us feel relaxed and even had our salad split because we said we wanted to share it. I had the filet mignon with the au gratin potatoes and my bf had the short ribs. The portions are a good size so go hungry! Everything was cooked perfectly and was delicious!

Prime management had written to me and offered us prime seats (pun intended) overlooking the Bellagio Fountain to ensure we had an unforgettable experience. The meal itself was delicious. We had Crispy Rice with Salmon and Steak Tartare as appetizers to share and they were amazing. The Crispy Rice with Salmon in particular was out of this world. I then had the Filet Mignon, which was cooked perfectly, black and blue, which is obviously a world away from my teenage days as a vegetarian, but it was also incredible. The Truffle Mashed Potatoes are also a must have, although I have to say, I barely managed to eat half of my main course, as I have the appetite of baby bird and my eyes are definitely bigger than my belly! Anyway, after watching Cirque De Soleil - O, it was a perfect meal to finish a fantastic night and it didn't break the bank. I will definitely be back.",

We always recommend this place to our friends looking for a nice place to enjoy a good steak and some. Patio seating is always what we asked for during reservations too.  They always say patio seating is first come first serve, but we never had to wait more than 5 minutes to be seated from our reservation time. Service is top notch. Everyone is very kind and thorough. Someone is always making sure our drinks are filled and our table is free of crumbs.   We usually order the same things here. We share the 28oz bone in rib eye in medium, lobster Mac and cheese, some oysters and sauteed mushrooms. The steak is absolutely delicious and flavorful, cooked to perfection. It comes with a few sauces, but I only taste the sauces and not really having to use them because the steak is already perf without them. The side lobster Mac and mushrooms just go well with the steak.  The water show and night view of the strip is an extra added bonus to a romantic dinner here. Highly recommend this place, the food and the view.",

    "text": "Wow! I went here in a party of 8 and was seated at a window side table with a gorgeous view of the remarkable Bellagio fountains! The view was amazing, the restaurant's decor was extremely elegant with a modern touch and the ambiance was superb. My dining experience here was amazing and let me tell you why...   1.) Appetizers set the bar super high for the coming meal For those who love raw stuff- *We started with two large Seafood Platters. Served in an elegant setting that had the oysters, lobster, crab, prawns, mussel and clams over ice. Underneath the setting was another bowl that was conveniently placed (yet still hidden) for the shells. Everything in the seafood platter was extremely fresh and of great quality. I'm usually not a fan of oysters but these oysters were to die for. Alongside the sauces which include: cocktail, horseradish, and vinegar, *dont forget to ask your waiter for melted butter and Tabasco* best and most fresh seafood platter I have ever indulged in! *The Steak Tartare and Carpaccio was another great choice that we started our meal. Served with Tarragon Aioli and Grilled Crostini, I highly recommend this especially if you are drinking wine.  2.) I think the Steaks are made in heaven *The filet Mignon, medium rare, melts in your mouth. The steak cut so easily and was tenderly moist. It was perfectly seasoned and charred on the outside but exactly medium rare on the inside just how I like and wanted. It was served with a zesty roasted green chili, perfect to change up your palate. *The bone in rib eye steak was just as tasty! Seasoned more than the filet Mignon and a little more \"fatty\" I would recommend this for those who like their steaks more flavorful. This too melted in my mouth!  3.) The sides are small and properly portioned  *The glazed market mushrooms and truffle mashed potatoes were my favorite but I also was able to taste the creamed spinach and steamed asparagus. The mushrooms and mashed potatoes are a must order! I'm just glad they we're small portions or else I would've eaten all the sides and wouldn't have room for the main course!   4.) The service was amazing! *i wish I remembered our waiters name but he was awesome, I wish I could give him credit. After a couple of martinis, I forgot to ask. He was attentive, personable and funny. The dining experience definitely would not be the same without him and the incredible staff.",

Husband ordered the filet and I had the salmon, both outstanding and the best we've had.  I will say the people asking to take your picture while your enjoying your meal, make things a bit uncomfortable. You think it's a service provided and that you'll have an opportunity to view the photo at the end of your meal and decide then if you want to take it home.... but instead it's presented to you at the end of your meal, printed, framed, and entirely over priced. When you politely reject them your made to feel like you've wasted THIER time. Tad bit tacky considering how exceptional everything else was. I'd say to Bellagio to scrap it all together- you got a good thing going without.",

    "text": "Oh, what a night!  We came to celebrate my husband's birthday as he hit another milestone in his Life.  Thanks to wonderful friends, Jan K and Randy F, for joining us in LV.  You made this momentous occasion extra special and so memorable at Prime.  We were winding down on a 5-night drink, eat and be merry fest (husband's birth week) with Jan and Randy and had planned dinner at Prime on my husband's birthday.  From the late 90's when we've visited Las Vegas for either business or leisure, we've often passed by Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten's elegant steakhouse which overlooks the fountains at The Bellagio but never dined there until this Saturday.  I have to say that we've been fans of Chef Vongerichten since the early 90's when we dined at his first Vong restaurant in NYC.  He masterfully played with exotic spices and herbs to create his version of Thai-inspired French cuisine.  So, to dine at the first one of two Vongerichten restaurants in Las Vegas was a no-brainer.     This elegantly appointed restaurant offers a romantic ambiance within a classic steakhouse.  During warmer months, one can book a table overlooking the Fountains at The Bellagio.  But, it was too chilly so we that dined indoors.  Our server for the evening, Jason, was top-notch as he offered his oenophilic expertise while we placed our dinner selections.  He was attentive and non-intrusive as he and his team seamlessly kept our beverages filled, cleared plates, paced our dining selections and maintained a personable professional manner.  Appetizers: -Chilled Shelffish Platter with Coctail Sauce, Mignonette & Mustard Sauce. -Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras with Black Olives, Lychee & Brioche  -Golden Osetra Caviar with traditional accompaniments -Ribbons of Tuna with Breakfast Radish & Ginger Marinade  Salad: -Caesar with Romaine, Parmesan & Lemon  Meats: -A5 Certified Kobe Beef from Kobe, Japan 20 oz.  Seafood: -Cold Water Lobster Tail, 8 oz.  Sides: -Creamed Spinach -Gratin Dauphinois with Comte Cheese  Desserts: -\"Fountain\" of Glazed Donuts:  Blueberry, Chocolate, Oreo, Grand Marnier & Classic with Chocolate and Caramel Sauces -PRIME Cinnamon Bread Pudding --Birthday Truffles  This was an unforgettable and truly memorable birthday celebration with great friends.  Thank you, we are humbled by your company and generosity.",

We were able to see the different water shows every 15 min during our time there . Perfecting setting.   Staff is amazing. Very nice, humorous, and attentive to your needs.   The food is amazeballs!! I never finish my food and this time around I did. Ordered the 30 day old dry Ribeye it was soooooo good. Never had rib eye like this. Well cooked, portion was huge, and I don't think another ribeye can be compared to this. Eating another ribeye after this is like a downgrade. That's how good it was. Lol. The sides: Asparagus <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a> (must have), the Mushrooms very tasty, and the Mac and Cheese was ok, but everything else made up for it.   Although pricey for some, my husband and I thought it was well worth it. So if you're in town and want a nice dinner date, come here and requested for a table outside. Dinner and a show at once? How can you get disappointed?",

My $67 strip steak was not a great cut of meat with a huge grizzle line running through it so I had to cut around it. Where things got really strange was people were ordering drinks behind me and one gentleman ordered a crown and diet and immediately had stated that it tasted funny... A second person ordered what I believe was a jack and diet and had also stated it tasted funny... So on top of my old-fashioned which was pretty good I asked for a Diet Coke... I took one sip and spit it out I asked to see the bottle of the soda ... It turns out that bottle had an expiration date of October 2017. They then proceeded to pull all of the glass bottles of diet soda out of the bar and every single bottle was expired for at least six months. The bartender even took a sip himself and stated that it was unacceptable  The reason I am giving two stars is for the following... No one from management came up to where I was sitting twig knowledge the fact that a restaurant that charges $100 a steak Could make such a horrific error that could easily get patrons ill.    In all fairness they immediately removed all of the bottles and restocked them... They did comp me the bottle of soda, but I was quite disappointed that no one outside of the bartender acknowledged what had happened or apologized. Imagine all of those other people ordering drinks complaining that it tasted funny didn't realize they were consuming expired merchandise  I expect more from a restaurant that has the following prices next to their steaks     FYI for those of you who don't realize that diet soda and regular soda have expiration dates, the next time you drink one and it tastes awful look at the bottle or the can....   You may just be drinking old merchandise",

First, we called to see if we could reserve a table outside so we could have a nice view of the fountains. They did mention it was first come first serve, which is fine, but they failed to mention there was a private party on the terrace and we would not be able to go out there at all anyway. We were sat at a table fairly far from the windows where only one of us could catch a glimpse of the fountains. Next, the service was sorely underwhelming. We pondered whether this was his last day on the job and simply didn't care. Lastly, our three filet mignon were good, but did not stand out. The sides were the highlight of the meal. The truffle potatoes, mac n cheese, and sweet potato sides were fantastic. I was sorely underwhelmed with the entire experience. I'm hoping it was just an off night for the waiter and restaurant. The donut fountain should only be split by two people at max. The donuts are tiny, but the flavors were good.",

    "text": "It's needless to say that this is one of the best restaurants in all of Las Vegas, located in the Bellagio hotel. Bring your wallet, it will be $200 per person, at least. The restaurant view of the fountain show is magnificent, and overlooks the center of the Las Vegas strip, including the powers hotel and it's beautiful Eiffel tower. The fountain shows are magnificent, water dancing to Frank Sinatra music every 15 minutes or so. Fortunately I got there at about 9 PM, and sat right on the edge of the restaurant facing the fountains. If you're a late eater, this is ideal. The service is extraordinary, what you would expect from a top-tier restaurant. They offered me a special of surf and turf at $156, but I was set on the steak. The bread was outrageously good, and I had the New York Peppercorn steak. They serve it with three kinds of sauces, two of which I absolutely love and one of which was really good too. I also had sauteed mushrooms with it, and I started with a mango and tomato salad which was outstanding.  Bring your significant other and impress them - you won't be disappointed, and neither will they.",

    "text": "This review is specifically for John Burke.  I've never experienced such a condescending sommelier.  We asked for help ordering wine (priced @ 60-100 dollars) and received minimal help.  He gave one-line answers and seem almost bothered by the questions I had.  He had no follow up suggestions and had an arrogant tone that made the table feel awkward.   Example:  My question: What do you think of the Petite Syrah? (Priced ~ 70 dollars) His response: \"If you like drinking rough wine, go for it.\" (This was not said in a joking or light tone; zero follow up)  My thoughts: Just because we aren't ordering $1000 dollar bottles doesn't mean we deserve to be treated less than any other paying customer.   The food was great and well executed; however, there can be some significant improvement in the service department.  In terms of an overall experience, I would rate it 3.5 stars.  There are plenty of steakhouses in Las Vegas where I've had better experiences at.",

Yes, it is pricey - but the food is amazing and for special occasions... well justify it how you want the food is great!  I still can't bring myself to pay for imported Japanese Kobe beef steaks - but they have them at Prime!  They also had some chicken and seafood dishes.  It is a Chicago style, where you generally Oder the sides all separately.  Located in a lower level of The Bellagio, they do offer outside seating by the water - great to watch the fountains!  The rest of the interior is elegant and somewhat dark - although lite well enough to see menus without a flashlight app!  Service is excellent, and everything including the desert was wonderful.  Definitely a special occasion place!",

They don't have many dishes on their menu, this is very typical steak house, they do have a lot different choice of the steaks. The environment and decorations inside is really upscale and elegant, a wonderful place for a romantic date or special events with friends. They did have some large round tables for large group, which is great They also have some tables outside and right in front of the music spring , the view is fantastic. Our server highly recommended their classical dye aged Bone in ribeye, it said the meat is seasoned very well and full of flavor. So we tried this one, it is so yummy and perfect cooked, highly recommend, but the potion a very large potion, I cannot finish mine We also tried Bacon wrapped shrimp  Warm asparagus salad with market mushrooms  Truffle mush potatoes  For the dessert, we tried cinnamon bread pudding, this one is so delicious, a must try as well I have a wonderful time tonight, 5 star",

Why not one of the more well-known restaurants on the Strip if you want to go the expensive route?\" The name of the restaurant wasn't exactly impressive to me.   My impression of the place heightened as soon as I saw the interior though. This is actually quite classy! Then, to top it off, we had a nice window view of the Bellagio fountain and of the Paris hotel.  Phuong, our server was also quite helpful with his recommendation of the 28-day aged rib-eye steak with crab mashed potatoes. He also recommended that we pair it with a pinot noir, which we did. The meal was splendid. I only wished that he had mentioned how big the rib-eye steak was going to be... It looked like it could be a 32-oz steak. Wow. Ok, I can eat, but not quite that much. I ended up boxing half of mine to go. I especially loved the crab mashed potatoes -- what a perfect combination of two of my favorite food: shellfish AND mashed potatoes (the perfect side dish for steaks, in my opinion).   We also ordered a key lime pie for dessert with espresso. I enjoyed the pie a lot. It came with a thin layer of rock sugar in the middle. Crunchy and sweet, like candy.   Next time, if we come here again, I'd like to split the surf and turf. It appears a more reasonable serving per person.",

During dinner we noticed that they were preparing a small private banquet room that was situated close to our table. We jokingly asked one of our 3 servers if George Clooney was on the way.

I simply don't understand why it gets so many high ratings. It was very disappointing, to say the least. My steak was so incredibly dry that it tasted like something from Denny's (...yeah, gross). I'd rather spend money at Ruth Chris's or Flemings.  Anyways, let's get to the details. We ordered the following:   1. Seafood appetizer (came with lobster, shrimp, oysters, crab, and clams) -- not bad, the seafood tasted quite fresh and delicious. I'm a fan.   2. French onion soup -- please, do not burn the top of my soup. The top (the bread and cheese part) was so burned that I could actually taste it while drinking the soup. Uhmm, no.   3. T-bone steak -- my steak was DRY. I asked for medium, but it was honestly well done. For $70, please do not overcook my steak. The others in my group agreed, their steak was overcooked. Major negative.   4. Side dishes: macaroni and cheese (the cheese was WAY too strong), asparagus (good - but honestly, how can you go wrong with steamed asparagus?), sauteed spinach (ew - do NOT order this, the sauteed flavoring is just weird. trust me), baked potato (...it's a baked potato, nuff said)   5. Caesar salad - standard.   Honestly, i'm a huge steakhouse fan, and this has got to rank as one of my bottom choices in the future. Like I said, Ruth Chris's and Flemings tastes much better because the steaks are juicier and prepared with more detail. If i'm going to be paying $70 for a steak, the chefs should be sure to cook a steak medium if requested. This is just super disappointing...",

We got to sit on the patio, as requested (patio was closed due to wind, although it didn't seem windy) or 4. The $500 dinner tab matched the quality.  Don't get me wrong, it's a dimly lit, nicely decorated restaurant, with a good menu.  The steaks were cooked correctly and the sides were tasty.  When compared to other steak restaurants we have visited, and for the price, we expected to be blown away and were not.    If you get a chance to sit on the patio and view the fountain show while dining, I would definitely check it out.  That would be amazing.

Dinner here was definitely a driving factor and the primary reason I planned my return trip to Vegas. I typically don't order steak but last year a filet here changed my life and convinced me that beef is possible of trumping all when prepared properly.  To celebrate a special occasion I made reservations in advance to secure a seat along the windows which allows you to enjoy the Bellagio fountains throughout your meal. Our server Beau set the bar for service. He was personable, knowledgeable and attentive without being overbearing.  He suggested a moderately priced wine which paired perfectly with the 8oz filet I ordered. Although the truffle mashed potatoes are delicious, they are sometimes offered with lobster, which is divine.   This place is expensive, but True to the cliche \"you get what you pay for\" So if you're looking for an experience and not just a meal I highly recommend Prime. It just might change your perspective on culinary quality.",

    "text": "One of the Best Restaurants that I have ever been too.  So my girlfriend and I went to Vegas to celebrate our 2 year anniversary and I wanted to book a nice dinner with a nice view of the Bellagio Fountains. I eventually decided to make an online reservation at Prime with a request to have a table with a view of the Bellagio Fountains.   So we get to the restaurant and noticed some available outside seating and it turned out that one of those seats outside right next to the water was ours!   So my girlfriend had the filet mignon and I had the 18oz bone-in prime rib. We decided to share the sides which were buttered mushrooms, creamed spinach, and garlic mashed potatoes along with some red wine. Let me tell you, the meal was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. The steak was cooked perfectly and the sides accompanied the meal well. The view of the fountains was so picturesque and there were speakers that played the music of the fountain show. It was a magical night.  I think what made this night mostly memorable were the little things that made you feel like you were high-class. The host and server greeted us \"Happy Anniversary\". They even brought out a little lava flow cake for dessert with the words \"Happy Anniversary\" written in chocolate syrup. They even had a professional photographer who took photos of us which we eventually bought 2 of them as souvenirs for our night.  The only thing of note is that this restaurant is not for the budget-conscious. A dinner for 2 can easily set you back a $200+ if you go all-out, but my girlfriend and I don't go out to eat at restaurants all the time and this was a special occasion so I didn't really flinch twice at the prices. We got what we paid for.  Great restaurant! Amazing steak. Highly-recommended for a romantic night! Will definitely go back again!",

    "text": "One of my favorite restaurants in the city. Probably the best steakhouse. Husband and I were there for our 1 anniversary on July 4th, 2010.   FOOD We both enjoyed the Filets, Au Gratin Potatoes, which were the most delicious, decadent foods I've ever eaten. The Bearnaise sauce was the best I've ever experienced. They also brought a few other sauces like a peppercorn mustard and another I can't quite remember...all good.  SERVICE Spectacular. Helpful and always attentive. They brought us a little desert for our anniversary and made sure we always had everything we wanted.  ATMOSPHERE It's dark, plush and very romantic. The place settings and dinnerware were of high quality as expected. We sat next to a window overlooking the fountains of the Bellagio. It was after 7pm so it was dark and the lights were beautiful. When you make your reservation ask for a window seat or the patio (in the summer).  OVERALL First, the filets are easily the best on the strip. The price is a little on the high side as compared to other places where you can fill your stomach. But it is a high-end establishment for a high-end clientele. If you're the type of person who is concerned about $8 bottled water, then Prime may not be the place for you.   If you can drop around $200-300 (two people) for an excellent meal and it doesn't deplete your entire vacation fund, then I probably don't need to tell you that this is a must. Highly recommended. Go here, enjoy life because it's probably one of the best experiences you'll have.  BIO Jennifer(27) and Chris(31) are Vegas fanatics. Enjoying multiple trips every year, they continuously search for new and delicious findings Las Vegas has to offer.",

    "text": "What is up with the restaurants at The Bellagio? First a totally disastrous outing with Michael Mina. An entirely mediocre experience at Olive and last night Jean-George's troops were struggling for mediocrity.  Upon making reservations, we were alerted to the dress code. Jackets required. I dressed well and upon arriving a large portion of the clientele was jacketless...some downright funky. If you're going to state the rules, stick with them.  Upon being seated in the beautiful surroundings we were offered menus and the wine list. The wine selection was broad and deep. The markups were also broad and deep. I know many of the wines represented and they were unreasonably priced. Silly. A glass of Veuve Cliquot was considerably more than what I'd pay for a bottle.   The food....well, it was mixed. The bread was awesome. The sourdough was excellent but the pretzel bread was the real winner. We each got a piece. When I asked for another I was told they were running low and there would be no more pretzel bread for us. That was really too bad because it was the best thing on the table all evening. It was that good. I began with a salad...Heirloom Tomatoes, Burrata Cheese, Mussini Balsamic & Basil. The tomatoes were purple...a bit firm but OK. The dish was, well, ok. Kinda bland but passable. I had a steak waiting for me, right?  Unfortunately, yes. A Peppercorn New York Steak with Red Onion Compote. The compote was good. The steak was very tough. Cooked to a good medium rare, it was stringy and hard to eat. I ate less than half of it. Too much work. My guest is lactose intolerant which means no butter. The kitchen could not see it's way to prepare the carrots without butter. Same with the Brussels Sprouts. Maybe if we knew Jean-Georges Vongerichten...the enfant terrible of the food scene. Ah well.   I wonder if Jean-Georges has ever been in Las Vegas. Nonetheless, I'd advise to wander across the hall to Picasso or head off to the Palms to visit Alize. Now they know what they're doing.  1.5 stars.",

The filet was perhaps the best steak I've ever had...and we are from a city that prides itself on its meat so there is definitely a list to compete with! He started with the onion soup and got the surf and turf for his entree and was thrilled with all of it. We also split the mushrooms and gratin as sides. I didn't love the potatoes but he did; the mushrooms were delicious, though! I had mentioned it was his bday when I made the reservation and they surprised us with a TO DIE FOR molten cake and homemade ice cream. The service was also excellent -- very sociable and knowledgeable. Russell and Scott were the best! Although this was of course on the pricey side, the next morning, he woke up and thanked me again for the meal so it was worth it!",

There was three of us and all three of us have been to the top restaurants around the world I won't mention their names that you are familiar with them all. All three of us ordered the ribeye the ribeye was $80 just for the steak. The steak was chewy and fatty all three steaks where exactly this way. Even the waiter was not good never came back to ask as how our food was and seem to have an inpatient attitude when we were there. Our bill for all three of us was just over $500 and this was one of the worst steakhouses we have ever been to we all felt the same way.  There are a lot of big-name steakhouses in Las Vegas do yourself a favor and go there. None of us understand how this restaurant could have four or four-and-a-half star review it is not even close to that.",

    "text": "This steakhouse is located downstairs of the Bellagio on the side by the fountains. The escalators can be found next to Giorgio Armani. Dress is business casual (no shorts). Very plush decor and dim lighting makes it a cozy dining experience. They do have a small patio area for outdoor seating as well.  You can view the menu we had on our visit on 3/1/15 since there are a few price and dish changes: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbutterfly1465.wordpress.com%2F2015%2F05%2F01%2Fprime-steakhouse%2F&s=ece4cd06e3186716ceb69158ce215d0cd24776660a1a95faf324d67cacf7f21c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">butterfly1465.wordpress....</a>  Our Order: Potato Gnocchi Sea Bass Porterhouse Dry Aged Ribeye Bone in Filet Mignon Bottle of Red Wine: ($188) 13528 Isoceles - Justin Vineyards & Winery from Paso Robles. 77% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Merlot, 11% Cabernet Franc. Double Espresso: ($5.75) Added a twist of orange zest  The BF ordered the Bone in Filet Mignon. The meat was tender and extremely juicy. It was quite funny because as people were eating, there was a lot of moaning and comments on how good the steaks were made. The two favorite sauces were the Peppercorn and the Bearnaise sauce (made of clarified butter emulsified in egg yolks and white wine vinegar and flavored with herbs). BF wanted to try the Sea Bass and since I was still full from lunch, I obliged him (even though I didn't think it was a good idea). Unfortunately, I wasn't too fond of the fish, it had flaky chunks of meat but was slightly dry and didn't taste really fresh. I suggest just sticking to the meats here.  Service was excellent. I had requested a table close to the windows for the birthday boy and the table definitely gave us a great view of the shows. We were super lucky because it had just stopped raining and the night was clear for us to easily see the show. Our waiter was able to give us great descriptions of the food and provided fantastic recommendations. The chairs were pulled out for everyone and every time someone walked away, their napkins were folded. Drinks were constantly refilled and since there was a waiter always nearby, anything we needed was quickly retrieved.  Dinner came out to about $100/person for our group of 7 and was really worth it. With several good restaurant picks for my BF's friend's birthday, I've now been assigned as the restaurant-picker on all future trips! :D",

    "text": "**waiter name: Brandon **team #20  Came here this past Saturday (3/28) for my birthday dinner that was suggested by Maribel T. I went on Yelp! and trusted my fellow Yelpers with over 400 reviews and 4 stars. Made reservations through open table for 7 people at 9:30 after our jabbawockeez show. My friend told me they closed at 10, but they still took my reservations so we were fine.  We made it to the restaurant a little before 9:30, I went up to the hostess that we were there, we didn't get seated right away. Probably took 15 minutes or so to get seated, not sure why when I had made reservations, tables were vacant and it was close to closing so they weren't busy! We finally got seated and several of my friends noticed our waiter was \"sassy\"!  Food: * Filet Mingon ($66) medium rare. I ended up getting a steak, well duh! Something you should order at a steakhouse, haha! My steak was perfectly cooked and all 3 sauce that they gave me were delish that I couldn't choose which one was my favorite!   *truffle mashed potatoes, they were yummy!! I totally recommend!  Service:  Our waiter had a stupid, awkward, sarcastic, rude, dry personality! Since the moment we sat down half my party were annoyed by him. My friend asked where the restroom was and pointed one side and when she was getting up he told her something else. Towards the end, the waiter came up he asked if we wanted dessert. We said no thank you and he stayed saying \"talk to me\" leaving us in an awkward situation as if he would not leave until we ordered. Not only did we have a problem with our waiter but the other two waiters cleaning the table next to us were very unprofessional. They are cracking inappropriate jokes to each other that it made me feel like I was eating in a \"ghetto\" steakhouse; they were obnoxiously loud. One of the waiters continued to crack jokes across the table while he refilled our glasses with water. We would say thank you, and normally we get a \"my pleasure\" but nothing from the waiters here. A friend of mine asked for a to go box for her food, the waiter brought back her food in a to go box and said \"here's your doggy, I mean your food.\" They were such jerks! We felt treated like dirt as if we weren't paying customers!   I've been to several steakhouses in California and service was always superior, always exceeded my expectations. The food was good but it does not outweigh the terrible service we received.   When my friend went to the restroom, the lady was cleaning the stall but told my friend to use it and she will clean it after. My friend said she'd wait for the other stall...obviously she didn't want to clean it twice. As an employee, you should treat your customers as if you just opened. Just because you're about to close the restaurant, doesn't mean you should rush your customers out of the restaurant or act inappropriate.   This dinner was for my \"golden bday\" (28th bday on the 28th) and it ruined all of our nights with the service. I don't recommend anyone coming to this place, especially if you care about customer service. The employees here act like they're in high school, very unprofessional and immature!",

The service is always professional and diligent, if not a little cold. Being a steak lover, I have had some of the most consistent cuts of filet, always cooked perfect. Dining with a group, we splurged on the seafood tower and although insanely expensive, it was top quality for the evening. The pricing here is really expensive across the board however they clearly haven't cut any corners on decor and staff.  Whether dining with friends, clients or wife/husband it really is a perfect surrounding.  I would have rated this 5 stars but have to admit the last visit was uncharacteristically average but of course the same price. This is likely an oddity and look forward to the next visit.",

    "text": "Likely the best meal we've had in Vegas to date!  Snagged an early (5:45pm) reservation last minute on Open Table. We had skipped lunch and were hungry early, so this was great.  Dress code says jackets are recommended, but I think I only saw one or two men actually wearing one. My husband wore a button down shirt and dress pants and looked fine. I saw men in Polo shirts, so don't worry about not being snazzy enough. It's the sort of place that is fine with business casual, but you wouldn't feel out of place if you got really dressed up.  We were seated right next to the window with an amazing view of the fountains. We had a main waitress, along with another waiter and a nice young man that served our drinks and cleared our plates. My husband ordered a glass of the house cabernet. Fair warning, it was $26! This is not the place to go if money is tight.  We skipped appetizers. My husband ordered the surf and turf (large lobster tail and beautiful fillet). It was the \"special\" that evening and came with a $120 price tag. I opted for the salmon which came in closer to the $40 mark. Although my salmon came with (fantastic) truffle mashed potatoes, we also split the gratin dauphinois. Highly recommend. Everything was divine! The sauces that accompanied my husband's steak were delicious and I practically licked my plate clean.   The restaurant itself is beautiful. Very opulent. Decorated in light blue and chocolate brown. Heavy drapery. Food is brought out on a rolling tray under silver domes. Fancy schmancy. I was a bit surprised that my napkin wasn't swapped out for a black one since I was wearing a black dress. Seemed like the sort of place to do that.  We ordered the cheesecake, and while nothing out of this world, it was still delicious. The bill came. $320. Whew! This is now our most expensive meal to date. But you know what? You only live once. When in Rome (Vegas), right?",

    "text": "Beautiful restaurant with a beautiful view. Started with the beet salad and the tomato and burrata salad as an appetizer. Then I went onto the French onion soup which was the best French onion soup I have had thus far. My partner had his usual wedge which was just OK the dressing was a little thicker than usual but Maytag blue cheese makes everything great. We share the dry aged bone in ribeye which was cooked completely perfect to a charred real plus. We also shared the mushroom medley mix the mashed potatoes had chunks of black truffle in them and their house Layered style potato was nice and crispy on top. The sent us out a beautiful dessert platter with all the new deserts. It's a beautiful steakhouse with one of the best views I've seen in Las Vegas and has a hefty price tag to match. Prices aren't on the Internet or on OpenTable but you're averaging between $60-$75 for a steak $15-$20 for a salad and $15-$20 for sides. I have to put in that the back waiter Eric was one of the most pleasant back waiters that has ever served on our table. And he made our experience fantastic!",

I've definitely had better steaks for much less $$. The French onion soup was delicious but the bread and cheese had already fallen into the soup upon arrival. The dessert portions are tiny. Ask for a table with a view of the fountain. And for the guys-  be sure to wear pants, as shorts are not permitted inside the restaurant. (Though the restaurant does have crappy pants to lend you)",

It is across the street from the Eiffel Tower at the Paris Hotel so that added to the amazing g view.  Now having said that, a group of four were seated at a table next to my husband and I.  They were drunk and loud in the otherwise quiet restaurant.  They ruined the atmosphere, especially when one of the women apologized to her husband (for the entire restaurant to hear) for having her monthly flow during their Vegas trip.  Not something no one wanted or needed to know!  The service was excellent along with the food.  The steaks are cooked perfectly and the dipping sauces for the steak are a must try.  Make sure you dress up when visiting there is a dress code and the restaurant is very high class.",

Our waiter, Rob, had worked at Prime since it opened 17 years ago!  Soft-spoken, not pushy or intrusive yet he was helpful and informative, as well as super nice, Rob was a seasoned veteran in the service industry and we benefited.  All of the additional staff assisting, bringing out wine, entrees and filling our glasses etc., were wonderful as well.  To start, I ordered the Market Tomatoes and my fiance ordered the Baby Iceberg lettuce salad.  We told Rob we would be sharing and he offered to split them for us.  We took him up on that and we were so glad we did!  Perfect portions and no scooping or reaching over the table.  For dinner, I ordered the Peppercorn New York Steak.  Seriously one of the best New York steaks I've ever had.  I highly recommend it!  It has a bit of a spicy kick to it because of the peppercorn which I loved.  My fiance had the Dry Aged Bone-In Rib-eye.  It was delicious too.  For sides we ordered the Brussels Sprouts with bacon and pears.  Not the best I've had but they were very good.  (I read another review on here that said they had potatoes in with them, unless they changed their recipe, those weren't potatoes, they were pears.)  And we got the Gratin potatoes...crispy, cheesy potato goodness.  It really was a spectacular meal with wonderful service.",

Although we sat inside this time, I would love to sit outside next time! The Cosmo here is one of the best I've ever had! We started off with the bacon wrapped shrimp appetizer. It only came with 3 shrimp so we added an extra in there so we could both try two. It is definitely good but overpriced for what it is. ($7 per shrimp).   My boyfriend ordered the dry aged rib eye steak for his main and I ordered the New York strip. His rib eye was very good except it was very fatty. I know rib eyes are suppose to be on the fattier side but this piece in particular was extra fatty. However, overall it was very good. My New York strip was perfectly cooked, my boyfriend actually enjoyed mine more and I enjoyed his more! For our sides, we got truffle mashed potatoes and the mac and cheese. BOTH are a must try! I think the sides really stood out. Very generous with the truffle in the mashed potatoes and the mac and cheese had the perfect amount of \"gooey\"-ness. I will probably go back just for the sides!   We finished the night off with the chocolate cake, which was a very decadent molten chocolate cake with the perfect amount of vanilla ice cream to go with. I highly recommend this place for special occasions as it can get quite pricey! Service was very attentive as well.",

    "text": "ORIGINAL Two-Star Review:  A co-worker and I ate dinner here during a convention stay - this was not our first time to visit this particular restaurant, but the experience this time left a lot to be desired.  We made a reservation and were promptly seated - after ordering, our salad came out then we waited over an hour for our steak and sides to be delivered.  Meanwhile, our waiter disappeared on us yet all of the tables seated after us received their meals and, in one instance, finished their meal and left before we were served.  Our waters were promptly refilled by the staff but it would have been nice to have our waiter come back by to see how we were, offer us another cocktail, etc.  We had to call over a manager (once we finally found one) to inquire about our order.  Lo and behold, it came out five minutes later - no apologies or explanations. The food was good, but this is the most expensive restaurant we ate at during a three-day convention.  For these kind of prices, you should reasonably expect good service.  There are a lot of good places to eat / steakhouses on the Strip, and I would recommend you take your hard-earned money elsewhere.  12/19/17 Updated Review:  I was subsequently contacted by Anna H., the General Manager of the Restaurant, and we exchanged a dialogue of emails.  She graciously offered to comp the meal and remove it from my room bill - that happened, but in a case of bait-and-switch five days later they put the full amount of the charge back on my credit card.  Attempting to contact Anna again, this time by telephone at her alleged direct number, I was informed the staff was unable to take a message for her, unable to answer questions, nor does the staff have voicemail.  This is an amazing display of a lack of customer service - the managements says they are going to give a refund, give said refund, then charge back the full amount less than one week later.  My not going to the Bellagio for my annual visit certainly won't hurt the MGM's bottom line, but you truly see where they stand in terms of customer service.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",

Big thanks to Ericka for going over and beyond & setting us up w/ a table view of the Bellagio Fountain.   Sat at the bar while we waited for the table to clear up, and these old school bartenders are just so rude to each other, especially Wayne. Constantly yelling at his colleagues and just making rude comments, his body language and demeanor was already uncomfortable.   When we got to our table, Howard G. just came by, dropped off our food menus and walked away. Mind you, we brought our unfinished drinks to our table from the bar, and he didn't even offer a wine/cocktail menu, and when we asked for one, he rudely asked for our IDs, all while our drinks form the bar was in our hands. He quickly went over the food menu asking us what we wanted, didn't even try upselling us with wine or any specials or recommend anything from the menu. He is the True definition of needing to \"leave your sh*t at the door before coming into work\" or he just hated young looking asian girls or 2 females dating each other?!  Shout out to Grace who is simply just a photographer that comes around your table taking picture and then developing them for an additional cost. Her delightful spirit uplifted our hearts, as all we were trying to do was enjoy a dinner together.   Desserts came by, Howard didn't even offer a desert menu, but rather slapped down the complimentary 3 piece truffle chocolate plate that was written \"Happy Anniversary\" on it. Totally insincere, and I still question why I gave him 20% Tip, BUT of course he doesn't know that money is NOT an issue and that both my GF and I know a thing or 10 about the Food&Beverage industry, right?!   Dry Aged Bone In Ribeye topped Oscar Style was delicious, but the Halibut was even better! Amazing truffle mash and mushrooms! So many other restaurant out there are worth the while with good food and good service, just not Prime with Howard!",

The filet was amazing not to mention the 3 complimentary sauces. We were even able to split the 10oz. Mashed potatoes and onion rings were also perfect. They brought a birthday dessert and we ordered the bread pudding both were at amazing!",

I gave 4stars is because they put someone's order drinks into our billed and we just realized the next day. So.. Just becareful of that.",

We cancel our reservation at Lago because the day before the people that work at Prime (hosts and waiters) tell us the Prime is better for watching the fountains. 2. We get there and the hosts cannot find the dining credit. It's a $200 dinning credit and they cannot find it. And I talk to the park mgm staff and they are telling me that it's there and they should see it. So Ballagio, park mgm, and the hosts at prime cannot communicate. 3. Then and despite changing our reservations to prime to sit by the fountains, prime will not sit us by the fountain because the manager has closed it. And what is the worst is that lago didnt close its patio and the Lago staff says that they wont ever close it. So, if you are picking Prime bc it has a patio, GO WITH LAGO NOT PRIME.",

Then broccoli did come with a white sauce on it which, has I been paying enough attention to menu, I would have left it off. I just prefer my broccoli steamed with nothing creamy added. The dessert was a cinnamon bread pudding. You MUST get this. I was hesitant and would have never ordered it, but the bartender recommended it. We always eat at the bar and this one has a tv for those who are into things like games. This place is high end, very classy and expensive. Very. Worth every penny!",

Server was professional, knowledgeable, friendly, and down to earth. Not at all stuffy. The server managed the dining experience while others performed the job of bringing the food and cleaning up. Water was always topped off. We were checked on at appropriate times but in a very unobtrusive way allowing time for conversation. Pace of the meal was excellent with just the right amount of time between courses to not feel rushed but also not feel like the wait was too long.   Ambiance  Very classy and upscale interior inside the Bellagio. Some dark woods and dark upholstery giving it .. a somewhat \"heavier\" feel inside than the competing SW Steakhouse at Wynn. Upscale without feeling overdone.    Food Everything was really just superb. Unique cocktails from the bar were beautifully presented.  The breadbasket... omg!  The pretzel bread was out of this world. The Caesar salad was one of best I've had. And the steaks, of course, are the highlight of the meal. Perfectly cooked. Sides are ala carte - try the mushrooms and of course the classic mashed potatoes!  The baked Alaska dessert was delicious with a passion fruit filling. Such a rare dessert to find in a restaurant. A plate of truffles was also provided since we were celebrating a birthday.   Mojo Exceptional. Great service and great food. Slightly more traditional interior design than the competing SW Steakhouse at Wynn but otherwise both are similar in many respects. Upscale dining at comparable prices, but your money is well spent here for an exceptional meal.",

I asked if there was a more romantic table available and she said that she could sit us by the window but it would be a \"very long wait\". Since it took her 35 minutes past our reservation time to seat us, we accepted the back table. A highlight was we got to meet most of the people at the restaurant when they had to go to the bathroom! The food was good, and we were fortunate as the large table of 20 wasn't too loud. There are just too many other choices in romantic-setting restaurants to come back here.

    "text": "Smooth wines, juicy steaks, melt-in-your-mouth sides and rewarding desserts... this was one of the best meals I've ever had. And, I got to experience it with some of my most favorite humans on earth.   Met a few of my faves in Vegas, to welcome 2018, over a great meal. A couple of them had chosen Prime, as they had it a few years ago and said they wanted us to taste for ourselves. They told no lie.   It's located inside the Bellagio and if you can, you should request a table with a view of the fountain show. It's truly a spectacular view. Arrive early and grab a drink at the bar and just really enjoy the views, because it's a visually stunning restaurant. Btw, the Emeritus Pinot was devine.   The service is impeccable. Every single staff member displays the utmost hospitality, from the hostess, to the sommelier.   We started with a bottle of the Melka CJ Cab and Hourglass Merlot, which both were velvety smooth. The Hourglass had a slightly bitter afternote, but wasn't bad. The Melka was the table's fave, so we had to get another bottle. The wines paired extremely well with all of the food.   The food was nothing short of amazing. The steaks are juicy and cooked to perfection. Hubby and I shared the dry-aged bone-in ribeye, which was so marbly and yummy. We also shared the filet mignon, which was tender and delicious. The steak sauces were all flavorful, and surprisingly the soy was my fave, because I thought I'd like the bearnaise more. The entire table shared all the sides, which we ordered 2 of each. The truffle potatoes were whipped to perfection and literally melted in my mouth, SO yum!!! The mac and cheese was so good, as well as the brussels, and creamed spinach. I should mention I had a bite of my friend's cesar salad, at the beginning of the meal and it was also really good. Oh, the walnut bread was my fave too, but the pretzel one was also good! And the desserts were soooo good too! I had a bite of the chocolate cake, which was the perfect ending to the meal. The bread pudding looked amazing, but I could not take another bite of food, or I'd pass out right there.   It's not often that I endulge in a 4-star restaurant, so it's truly a treat to experience and Prime was a great choice! Treat yo self!",

    "text": "My friends and I visited Vegas last weekend and were so excited about our reservation to eat here. Unfortunately, it was the most disappointing part of the trip. The items are so expensive relative to the size. Each side (we got Mac and cheese, Au gratin, mashed potatoes, and steamed asparagus) comes in the tiniest cast iron skillet so portions are about the size of an apple. The Mac and cheese was my favorite, but I could only have a bite since it was being shared at the table.   For entrees, my boyfriend got the dry aged bone in ribeye and wasn't impressed by it at all. He described it as bland, as did another friend who got the same thing. He also ordered it rare, but thought it was cooked more than a rare steak should be (it was slightly pink, but not that dark pink/ red color of a perfect rare steak). I got the peppered tuna steak and i had to force myself to eat it. It only had whole peppercorn as the seasoning and way too much of it. I let my friends try it and they said it tasted like someone dipped the tuna in a bucket of peppercorn and put it on my plate. I know that \"peppered\" is in the name, but I thought I'd get something with complex flavors and high quality seasoning. It was so depressing and made me wish I got three sides of Mac and cheese as my main dish instead, which would have been the same price.  At first I thought something was wrong with me for not liking the flavors of most things on the table (asparagus also had no seasoning and I longed for the asparagus I cook at home myself), but I quickly realized my whole table didn't feel blown away by anything they got. When you're spending $150-200 on dinner, you should feel like you're getting your moneys worth either in terms of taste, quality, and quantity. This place disappointed me in all of those ways.   The highlight of the meal was the seasoned butter that was served with bread at the start of the meal, and sitting near a window where I could see the Bellagio fountains.",

But because it was a holiday, reservation by the patio/windows were all full. :( So reserve ahead of time during the holidays!  FOOD: We ordered filet mignons, short ribs ($41.00), and their Chilean Sea Bass ($45.00) with a side order of Ginger Sweet Potatoes, Jumbo Asparagus, and Butternut Squash Soup. I would stick with the Filet Mignon ($67.00), definitely their specialty. It was soooo good. The meat just melted in my mouth, it also came with three different sauces to complement the meat, but I prefer mine plain. The cut was perfect, no tendon was to be found, and the quality was absolutely perfect! My grandmother also really liked their sea bass, said it was cooked perfectly and she absolutely loved her Butternut Squash Soup. Their Asparagus and Sweet Potato Mash are highly recommended, both very good quality and light side dishes to pair with the steaks. The short rib was okay, while the meat was very tender and juicy, the enormous amount of heavy sauce just ruined the dish for me. We also got a basket of bread as appetizers! The raisin bread was highlight of the basket. :)  SERVICE: Our waiter was just terrific, he was very personable and knew how to talk and draw his customers in. He made a lot of great recommendations and was also making sure we got what we needed including all allergies and special diet restrictions. The food could take a while, but they provide bread as you wait.  ATMOSPHERE: They do have a dress code that they enforce- business causal is more like business formal. All the men were in clean-cut suits and the women in nice dresses and heels. The lighting is dim and very classy, it's a quiet place that don't allow kids under 6 years old to dine in. Although from looking around, no kids seemed to be around the restaurant.  Lastly, they have complimentary self-parking for Bellagio if you're dining in!",

Pedro, with the caring and on the spot support from Natalio made sure our evening was memorable.  The food was second to none and included what we felt was THE highlight dish, that being the Short Rib. The Rib Eye was ok but a little tough, appetizers choices were a great Cesar, awesome carpaccio with steak tartar. The only let down was the sommelier who gave us a bit of cold shoulder, probably due to the fact we brought a very special 25 year old bottle of wine. We gladly paid the $50 corkage fee to enjoy our special keepsake, but would have loved to enjoy the same courtesy and caring service provided by Natalio and Perdo....Thank you gentlemen.

Ambiance was beautiful and romantic. Had a table next to the glass windows where you over look Lake Bellagio and the fountain show.   Waiter was on point, continually asked if we needed anything, etc. Paid us lots of attention, perhaps he wanted his tip, either way, he worked for it.   I had the 8 oz filet mignon and hubby had the rack of lamb. We ordered 2 sides each, I suggest just ordering 1 each otherwise way to much food. Ordered the asparagus, spinach, yams and of course we had to try the truffle mashed potatoes...OMG, they melt in your mouth!!! Oh and we shared the butter nut squash soup very tasty. Too full to have dessert :-(   Definitely a place to dine while in Vegas for a romantic, tasty dinner!  Make sure and make reservations, we called twice, once they didnt have any reservations left, they suggested we call back around 2:30 for any cancellations and we got lucky.  So make sure and make reservations, no walks in I'm sure.",

    "text": "Took my man for his 33rd birthday dinner and this place did not disappoint. I made a last min reservation by phone 4 hrs before going but only because it was a Monday night and we didn't expect it to be too busy. The place closed at 10pm that night and I was able to get a reservation for 2 at 9:30pm, the hostess had mentioned that they were actually busy for a Monday night. The moment you step foot into the restaurant the light is a lot dimmer, and to the right is the restaurant Bar top with about 8-10 stools and to the left the hostess stand. The restaurant decor was fancy with lots of paintings on the walls and pretty blue ceiling to floor curtains that are pinned to the walls. Once we were seated the waiter came to the table with menus and gave us a few recommendations. My bf ordered the bone in ribeye and I ordered filet mignon, they were absolutely delicious! Cooked perfectly on the outside but yet juicy and tender on the inside. Neither were overly seasoned! For our sides we ordered the Mac and cheese, gooey and creamy and has to be one of the best I've had, and the creamed spinach. The creamed spinach wasn't amazing, was a little bland but ok since it was a healthier choice. They do start you off with sourdough and raisin bread with butter in the beginning and both were delicious! We each got a cocktail, one steak each and two sides to share and the bill came out to 220.00 without tip. It was well worth it and more importantly, worth it to see my boyfriend satisfied. We would definitely come here again!",

The steak was perfectly seasoned and cooked well.  The wine was great went perfect with the steak.  Desert was tasty.  The evening was great service was perfect had a great time",

After browsing through a few reviews, in addition to reading through the menu, we decided on PRIME. The restaurant itself is absolutely stunning, and the front-row seats to the fountains (both indoor and out) certainly didn't hurt. The waitstaff was out of this world - attentive, humorous, and knowledgeable (ask for Howard, you won't be disappointed.) Cocktails were perfectly balanced, and dangerously delicious. Their Gluten-Free menu was extensive, and Howard made sure every side that could be made GF was, as well as oversaw the plating to ensure neither my Mom nor I got sick. I don't believe there is a bad dish on the menu, from the Colorado Lamb to the Filet Mignon (the Steak Tartare was divine, and both the Truffle Mashed Potatoes and Ginger Sweet Potatoes were out of this world.) While certainly not a restaurant we will return to daily, this will absolutely be our go-to spot for special occasions.",

Hits the spot that it hurts so good!! The pretzel bread is to die for, every time I want to just take a basket to go!! For my entree I get the dover sol, I'm not a red meat fan. So many sides are amazing. The mushroom, broccoli, cream corn all perfect to share. Make sure you save room because the desserts are delicious. While the service is impeccable by the entire staff, Sandy is even better. Overall if you haven't experienced a dinner at Prime don't wait any longer to go! The next special occasion book a reservation and experience a dinner you will never forget. Venture out, cheers!",

If you haven't been in a while it is time to try it again.  Excellent service from start to finish. Our servers were skilled and well versed, especially Andrew and Wayne.  We had a great chat about their extensive whiskey selection.  Andrew's knowledge was impressive to say the least.  If you are looking to dine on a budget look elsewhere but as they say, you get what you pay for.  As Vegas locals we don't make it to the strip as much as we would like but Prime is worth the trip.",

I remember the oysters melting in my mouth as I squeezed a lemon on top and slurped each one into my mouth! I ordered the fillet mignon and my fiance ordered the rib-eye.  The fillet mignon was great; grilled exactly how I liked it -- medium rare.  I personally enjoyed the rib-eye only because the cut was more tender.  We were told the meat has been aged for a period of time which indeed brought out the flavor in the beef. Can't wait to go back to this place the next time we visit!   The service was phenomenal; waiters are well attentive to your needs. They are very personal & are consistently checking up on you making sure the food is tasting great. We got a lakeside view next to the window, so we got the chance to see the water show in front of the Bellagio nemerous of times. It's much more pleasurable to watch from the inside of the restaurant rather than standing with the crowd of tourists outside. I enjoyed the romantic ambiance of the restaurant... quiet, dimmed lights and tables covered in white table cloths with candles lit on the table. There was a photographer that came around each table to take pictures; she even showed us how to pose for the camera. But unfortunately we left too soon before she was able to come back to our table. We were given two complimentary guest passes two the Bank night club as well at the end of our dinner.    If you're a steak-lover, this place is a must try!",

Cooked with just salt and pepper, the flavor was amazing.  I have never had a bone-in filet before, and I am now ecstatic that I have!  The following day during lunch, I was eating my mediocre sandwich wishing that I kept the remaining part of the bone from the filet to gnaw on.  It was just outrageously good.  In addition, we obviously ordered some wine, side dishes, a couple apps, and dessert.  Favorite app was the Foie Gras because we are not allowed to eat it in CA.  It was a special treat to have.  Best dessert was the creme brulee.  Very light and flavorful.  Prime is one of my favorite steak places that I have been.  5 stars!",

    "text": "After trying so many steakhouses, Prime is only mediocre. The atmosphere to Prime is really romantic and has a good feel to it. It makes you feel like a classy person when you're in Prime and that goes for the price of your food as well. For the price and the taste of your food, you can probably get better steakhouses(Craft or SW ).   I did quite enjoy having the sauces on the side which give it a nice little spin to it. However, I only end up using one and we never got one of the 4 sauces( the miso-mustard). I was a big fan of the soy-rice wine sauce which was a winner for me(I believe there was garlic in it) Moving on, the steak was good quality but it didn't exactly differ too much from other steak houses(including Mastro where I get Porterhouse as well) for a more inexpensive price than I would rather go back to Mastros. On a side note, what did win for me in Prime was their sides. Their sides were one of the better sides that I've had(way better than SW) in my opinion. The mac and cheese which was layer with lot of truffle(yay) was quite awesome and so was the mash potatoes.   Oh the service was wonderful and they didn't charge us for a bottle of wine that we brought(usually it would be $50 so be warned)...probably because our bottle of wine was too cheap for them :p. Whatever the case, I like that they didn't charge for us it. The dessert were okay.   You can give it a try when you are in Vegas but the winner for steakhouses for me is definitely Craft. I do highly recommend bring a girl to a date here since it is quite the place as you can even see the bellagio's water show which was a +.",

    "text": "This is one of the most beautiful rooms in Las Vegas and one of my favorite restaurants, so when my best friend asked where I wanted to go for my birthday, Prime was my pick.  We requested one of the tables for two up against the windows overlooking the fountains and I was kind of surprised that the place was packed on a Wednesday night. Even the outside patio was full. Fortunately, I do have a casino host to take care of things like this.  In any case, the food and service are just superb here. Just my opinion, but once you are at a place that is using the best ingredients and knows what to do with them, the rest is just what kind of ambience you are looking for and other very subjective things. We wanted to talk and have a laid back evening without blasting music and a low douche factor.  We were served an amuse of salmon on cucumber, which was a fabulous start. I had the tomato and burrata salad, which was perfection. It's amazing that something so simple like a perfectly ripe tomato can taste so wonderful, although most of the time I'm just used to whatever passes for a tomato in CA.  My friend had the seared foie and said it was in her top 5.  For our entrees, I chose the surf and turf special- lobster tail and a filet that was at least 3 inches thick with a tablespoon of lemon spaetzle, while my friend had the peppercorn New York. Both were cooked medium rare as asked. Two plates of heaven.  The sauces are really standouts here. I could have had a glass of the soy/ rice wine. It was perfect with my lobster and the filet.   For sides, we had fingerling potatoes, cream corn and tempura onion rings. Only the onion rings didn't hit it out of the park- they were just OK.  As you would expect, the service was friendly but professional and I really did appreciate the server mentioning the price of the specials. The surf and turf was $118 (hey, it was my birthday!), but it can be awkward in a group or business dinner if someone has to ask. I've been burned a couple of times.  For dessert, they sent out a trio of lemon tart, vanilla bean ice cream and a chocolate mini-cake. Yum!  While Prime is one of the more expensive steak houses in Las Vegas, it is certainly a great pick for a special occasion or when you just feel like treating yourself to a lovely evening.",

    "text": "Outstanding steakhouse. I'm usually not one for 'top dollar' kinda restaurants but I was in Vegas and it was my girlfriend's birthday. We just came out from the Pacquiao Bradley fight and has reservations here.   Let me say, I would normally have been taken back by the prices, but since I was 'in Vegas', I figured I would just roll with it.  Conclusion: I spent a lot of money, however, I really enjoyed the experience and the food.   I had the filet mignon, and my gf had the lobster tail. The main entrees wee great.  The sides were also exceptional. They were pricey for side dishes but they did not disappoint.  The best part was the 'house sauce' steak sauce. I forget the name but it was a ginger-soy sauce., that was crucial to the overall party going on inside my mouth!   Scrumptious, to say the least.   Now, one thing j really didn't appreciate at first was the photographer chick that shower up at our table and asked us if we would \"line our procured taken\".   Look, my gf is Asian and as you should know -- Asians like to take pictures. She is no exception. So, there we were.   \"taking pictures\". The initial result there was a $70 cost. But, the nice part is we have a 4 pack of nice pictures of that moment -/ which was very forced. ..  By the photographer.  Anyway, it was still very special and since I was 'in Vegas' -- I rolled with it and had a great time.   Thumbs up, Prime!",

    "text": "An almost perfect dinner in an almost perfect seat accompanied by almost perfect service.  The steak is certainly phenomenal, but I'll leave that to the other reviewers to rave about.  I don't think the steak is the BEST in the world, but my best might not be your best.  Once you hit a certain level of goodness, it's becomes exponentially difficult to stratify what is best and what is second or third best.    But I think I've fallen in love with our waiter that night.  If he was my waiter at every restaurant I go to, then all my yelp reviews would probably end up with an extra star.  Friendly, engaging, accommodating, caring, smart, eloquent, polite, perceptive...I've ran out of adjectives...   Too bad he's not the person who actually bring you the food or takes away your food; they were not as A+ quality.  The restaurant is beautiful and if you're lucky or special or important enough, you'll be able to get a seat at the window/balcony and watch the fountain show every 15 min.  But don't expect to get those seats if you're not  some VVVIP.   And unfortunately, being that this is in sin city, you will occasionally see diners in t-shirt and jeans...just look away and stare at the pretty decor instead...  Side note: I met Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten the night before at the Grand Tasting (a Vegas Uncork'd event) and what a gentleman.  Super nice and kind and took the minute to autograph my souvenir bag :)",

    "text": "First, I should start by telling you that Prime had previously been my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas so I hope that they are able to turn their operation around. However, like many Vegas institutions, once they \"jump the shark\" it typically does not get better.   The customer service has been lacking over the past several visits and it was absent on this recent dining night. I had to ask for bread three times and by the time it was brought out my bread plate was removed. Another guest requested drawn butter four times before it was brought out and by then the shellfish platter had been polished off. Additionally, several guests were forced to repeatedly ask for their drinks to be delivered. It may seem like a small detail, but the pepper mill did not work. Who is performing their quality control?  Finally, the attached photo shows just one of the two garbage cans in men's room, both of which were in nearly identical condition.   For a restaurant at Bellagio, especially Prime, to be in this horrendous condition and without the management oversight needed to ensure a pleasant dining experience from a diner guest service experience is completely unacceptable. I have been dining here since their early days but Prime is off the list for future dining plans.",

Of course being at the Bellagio the ambiance & decor was breath taking, especially with the water show in the background. Our server was excellent & attentive to our needs. The truffled mash potatoes melted in your mouth, however, we were sadly disappointed with our main course. The Colorado lamb was topped with a mushroom/tomato mix & shredded Parmesan (no indication on the menu). The portion size was sufficient, however I found myself scraping the topping off the lamb. I appreciate a nicely seasoned rack of lamb, but the toppings over powered it with a spaghetti flavor. The veggie accompaniment had a little too much pepper flakes. My husband requested a medium New York strip which came out mid-rare, a little to much blood for his taste. For a $300+ dinner, you should not have to compromise on food & flavor, which is what I feel we succumbed to. If it were service that wasn't to great & food on point we might take a chance on going back, but it wasn't. Definitely not to thrilled about our venue choice & I don't see ourselves coming back a second time.",

Almost all fine dining restaurants will have a great cut of steaks the way you would want them so in my opinion, it comes down to the unique sauces that they may or may not provide. Prime pairs their phenomenal steaks with Soy-Rice Wine, Bearnaise, and Peppercorn sauces which won't exhaust your taste palette and will keep you wanting for more!",

It's odd, though, jackets are preferred for men but they have no coat check. Anyhow, it's a nice dining room with fountain views. We noshed on the bread basket filled with a variety of sour dough, pretzel and raisin walnut.  First Course Tomato Gazpacho; Summer Flavors, Marcona Almonds & Olive Oil and Bacon Wrapped Shrimp; Passion Mustard & Cumin Scented Honey  Second Course Filet Medallions; Sweet Corn, Crispy Spaetzle & Fiore Sardo Cheese  Third Course Warm Valrhona Chocolate Cake; Vanilla Ice Cream and Summer Berries; Strawberry Gelee & Marsala Cream  The gazpacho must have been a blend of tomatoes and watermelon. It would make the perfect smoothie. Still, it was a refreshing treat with fun surprises of raspberries, strawberries, peppers, and marcona almonds. The shrimp were properly cooked and the bacon was nice and crisp. The flavor was a unique blend of sweet and smokey.  The filet was cooked to perfect and it sliced like butter. It was fantastic on its own, but coupled with the shallot sauce? Wow. We agreed the Bearnaise and au pouvoir hindered the already fabulous flavor of the steak. The spaetzle was light and tasty with the sweetness from the corn.  Dessert were tasty, but they were the weakest links of the meal. Properly executed but both just lacked pizazz. Service was attentive throughout the meal. Prior to Restaurant Week, we had never dined in a Jean-Georges Vongerichten restaurant. We've been missing out. Both Prime and Jean-Georges were highly enjoyable.",

Started with squash soup and Seared Foie Gras both were good. The ambiance is fantastic with the Bellagio surroundings and the memorizing fountain... stunning. It is very pricy, but inline with higher-end Las Vegas showcase restaurants.    So the negatives: I started the meal by ordering a dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives, it was very good. The problem is they started slamming down plates as soon as the drink was served.  I hardly had time for a few sips before the super fast service started.  It was Go Go speed racer style service. It felt very rushed. The rushed plating and service made the experience feel very touristy. The waiter forgot our wine order, we had to remind him. This seems especially bad for a fine steak house to fail to service up the ordered wine with the main course., a fat juice steak, that begs for a big red wine. I would assign most of our negative experience at the hands of the waiter... he seemed distracted and lacked the finer art of high quality service.",

The lobster, broccoli, capaccio and au gratin potatoes were some of the best versions of each I've ever tasted, and my entire party agreed.  My steak was just okay, cooked perfectly but a little light on flavor, however the sauce (soy, rice wine vinegar, etc.?) was amazing.  I wanted to bathe in it.  The place is definitely upscale, and though we weren't dressed like slobs, we were clearly underdressed a bit, which may have accounted for the very average and not overly attentive service.  Maybe they thought we couldn't afford the place, but the service was decidedly average.  The waiter was nice, but didn't seem to take much time at our table to make suggestions, explain the menu or stop by to make sure we were doing okay.  Considering I spent $250+ on my portion alone, I would have expected that to be elite as well.  Still, like I said before, food rules the day ultimately at restaurants and in that regard it was amazing.  I would suggest a sport coat for guys at the least and not just a buttoned-up shirt or nice sweater like we had on, as most parties seemed a little more dressed up.  Other than that, amazing.",

    "text": "By NO MEANS is this going to be a disappointing meal.The ambiance was outstanding. Anyone considering eating here, really should try it. Now, for starters, I am a local. When we go for steak dinner, we have ONE place that we always go to and it never fails. (God willing, it never will) The Golden Steer. For my dad's birthday, we wanted to do something different this year so we tried PRIME. While waiting for our table we sat at the bar. You can tell these guys have been working here for a while. They had a great attitude and had stories for days. When we were seated, we could't be happier. We sat in a small room to the right (most private area) and were right by the window on the water watching the fountains in full light. It was stunning. We started with the Seafood Tower. Magnificent. It was beautiful and of course delicious. Here is my complaint: they brought us a serving for three people, which there were three of us. But, if you have ordered a seafood platter before, it is not customary to serve per person because there is SO MUCH. Most places have offered to make it for a person or two less than what is in your party. Afterall, this is an appetizer. $67/person. I wish our server would have been a little more honest with us. This is something that will happen when you're on the strip. Some of the wait staff will try to take advantage of you. Especially when in fine dining and they are only going to turn their tables once or twice on a busy evening. So needless to say, we had way too big of an appetizer.   For entrees we ordered the Bone-In Ribeye, and two peppercorn NY Strips. $61 for the NY and I believe $70 for the Ribeye. We got sauteed mushrooms, creamed spinach, and mashed potatoes for the sides. We also ordered some bernaise for the steaks. Yeah yeah, so I like sauce with my steak. The steaks were great. Cooked perfectly as well. But, first world problem, it just didn't melt in our mouths. It was missing that perfect tender melt in your mouth feeling that just disappears with a couple of chews. There was just something missing. They did however have a really nice char on them that left a crispy crust. The mashed potatoes though. My god. It was like a pot of melted butter. You had to eat them with a spoon. They were the best I have ever had. The sauteed mushrooms were great too. It is a wild mushroom blend fyi. The creamed spinach was okay. Nothing to write home about.  Total Bill: $544 (Tip not included.) We left a $100 tip. So this was a little over $200/person.   I am very happy I went. It was a memorable dinner filled with good company, lots of alcohol, and some professional pictures taken by their house photographer. (Completely unnecessary but we were drunk by this point) So if you are considering going to PRIME while you're visiting in town, do it. I am sure you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "My husband and I love steakhouses and of course this was one of the hot spots that we had to try. I had a couple of people recommend this restaurant and I was so excited to try it out when we got to Vegas. The decor is lux and beautiful. Very elegant but not too much. Low lighting created a great romantic atmosphere. Especially the booming of the water fountains at Bellagio.What great entertainment.   Well with all the ambiance I was drooling for what more has to come. The service was great, staff was very nice but it wasn't outstanding for an expensive restaurant especially for Vegas. The bread and butter was nothing to rave about. So come on steak! I'm a Rib Eye fan and always order it so then I can do a fair comparison for the quality and taste of the steak. When the steak had arrived, I dived into it and kept on cutting and cutting. Well it wasn't as buttery as I hoped. The fat on it didn't taste that great. And the meat itself was okay. Don't get me wrong. I did eat a majority of it with the three accompanying sides. 2 out of 3 were good. The mushrooms I would not recommend but the potatoes with the bacon marmalade was very good. My husband didn't think his steak was amazing either but we loved seeing the fountains.   Would I recommend this place? No not really. There are so many amazing restaurants in Vegas this one was not one of them. It wasn't that it was bad but it was just disappointing. The one steakhouse that was unforgettable is STEAK from Gordan Ramsey at the Paris. That place I give 5 stars.",

It's view of  Paris' Eiffel Tower across the Fountain , is in my opinion,  the best seat in the house,  and when you are lucky enough to score that spot it really adds ambiance .  I love steak,  and i love the steak at Prime as it has been consistently tender, juicy,  and sizzling. I love getting the Miso mustard sauce with my Rib-eye and asparagus and a baked potato as my sides ( the mashed potatoes are to die for but i try and save room for dessert ) I also love their beet salad. I have not had anything other than steak as my Entree  here but i feel they have a pretty solid menu . Chocolate Souffle is excellent !  Service is more hit than miss so coupled with the great steak meal it still gets a 5 star rating from me after more than a few visits over the years . *Service last night was on point *~ Thank You !",

    "text": "My friends and I ate here on our first night in Vegas the last time we were in town. Two of my friends had been before, but this was my first experience. When I first walked into the restaurant, I was immediately struck by the traditional cushion-y blue velvet chairs and all of the heavy draperies. Stuffy, perhaps, but also beautifully and tastefully done.  I would recommend dressing up, as most of the men were wearing jackets. Of course, they won't kick you out if you show up in jeans, but it's a classy place, so dress appropriately.  We were seated right in front of the window, which provided a lovely view of the Bellagio fountains at night. So pretty! This was one of my favorite parts of the experience.  Trying not to over-do it on my first night of eating in Vegas, I ordered the Market Tomato Salad and the Scallops. I had a lemon martini to start, and it was fantastic. I asked for more savory than sweete, and the bartender made the drink perfectly. We ordered a Trimbach Riesling for the table, and this very dry riesling from the Alsace region in France has become one of the white wine staples I keep in my home.  The burrata on the tomato salad was perfectly creamy and balanced well with the fresh tomatoes. I've had some mediocre tomato-mozzarella salads in my day, but this one was perfect. The scallops were perfectly seared, and the capers added the appropriate level of salty bitterness to match the sweetness of the scallops. Delicious!  One of my friends ordered the filet as she always does, and it was a perfect medium, with the perfect level of charring on the outside. I tried a bite and dipped it into the peppercorn sauce. It was fantastic. I had a bite of creamed spinach as well, and it had just the right amount of acid to counterbalance the cream.  Enjoying conversation with friends while watching the Bellagio fountains at night capped off the evening. I can't wait to go back on my next trip to Vegas.",

    "text": "Expensive touted fine dining isn't hard to find in Las Vegas. However, such places that are worthy of their high price are rare and Prime meets that..to some extent. The service, decor, and ambiance are excellent - though I could do without the lady coming around asking if we want photos taken. I've seen some people say it took a while to get their food but we found the food come out quite quickly so that wasn't an issue. If you're lucky, you can sit outside with a view of the Bellagio water fountains but if you're inside, you do get the benefit of feeling a bit more cozy and warm. Regarding the food, everything we tried was delicious but only a few things blew me out of the water and the price was probably 1.5-2x more than I might pay elsewhere so that's something to keep in mind.  Appetizers: ribbons of tuna (refreshing light taste, good if you like tuna sashimi), crispy salmon sushi (my favorite and most unique, highly recommend), bacon wrapped shrimp, shrimp cocktail (about 4-5 jumbo shrimp) Main entrees: seabass (deliciouus!), filet mignon (medium rare, tasty), bone-in rib eye (personally liked this more than the filet but that's personal preference I think), grilled lamb chops (nicely cooked) Sides: truffle mashed potatoes (nice and strong truffle flavor), ginger sweet potatoes (they come mashed, delicious, similar flavor to the Chinese desert soup of sweet potatoes, ginger, and tong yuan for anyone familiar), onion rings tempura (nice and light compared to typical overly battered onion rings), brussels sprouts with bacon (pretty good but nothing crazy unique) Dessert: chocolate lava cake (good but nothing crazy), almond creme brulee (huge portion so expect to share this; but otherwise it was very tasty, creamy, light, and sugar crust was perfect thickness)  P.S. make sure to make a reservation!",

Thankfully you can order at the bar and if you pick the right spot at the bar you can catch the Fountain show. The bartender who is from Arizona but I sadly forget his name was absolutely hilarious, he had a dryer sense of humor but it paired along nicely with ours. My husband ordered the crabcakes and a main dish sadly I forget what it is I ordered the Caesar salad as well as the filet mignon. I have to knock a little bit of stars off because the Caesar salad was absolutely drenched in dressing almost made it unbearable but the steak earned back another star because it was so delicious and the sauces that they give for your steak absolutely mouthwatering.I wouldn't recommend this place but I would also recommend making reservations.  Update: while I was in town for business I stopped by again. Doug, the bartender from Tucson was there, I decided instantly to eat again at the bar. The service and conversation were once again wonderful! I highly recommend this restaurant while you are in town... and the view is bad either!",

We started off by having the Salmon Sushi as an appetizer along with our cocktails (old fashioned and Macallan 15) and for our entree we had the  porterhouse for two, accompanied by the Wine Glazed Mushrooms, Truffle Mash and the Mac and cheese.

Of course if anyone knows anything about prime steak then they know bone in aged rib eye is the cut of all steak aficionados. Our Ribeye did not dissapoint. The cut we got was well presented and well seasoned with 3 different sauces on the side. The decore is a touch of extremely classy Manhattan on the Bellagio fountains in Las Vegas.

We were in Vegas this past week celebrating both mine and my husband's birthdays within a week of each other. My husband mentioned that he heard about an outstanding steak restaurant called Prime that was right on the fountain, so I booked a reservation. The hostess greeted us and led us to our table we were blown away! The outdoor seating is right on the fountain and the water shows at this level were stunning! The wait staff were so attentive and accommodating. We ordered before dinner cocktails and they were delicious!  I can't remember the name but it had rum in it and was rimmed with sugar and cinnamon.   For an appetizer we got the the bacon wrapped shrimp with passion fruit sauce. It was amazing! I ordered the Scallops and my husband ordered the peppercorn crusted strip steak and we ordered the truffled mashed potatoes to share. The scallops were cooked absolutely perfectly, was tender and sweet. My husband said the steak was cooked to perfection, medium rare plus, and melted in his mouth. It also came with several different sauces that were delectable. Let me tell you, the truffled mashed potatoes were to die for, OMG so good!  Our food server went above and beyond and even brought me a different sauce to try with my scallops. He was great! We WILL be back to Prime as it has become, hands down, our favorite Vegas restaurant!",

When I say the steak was the second best of my life, it's no slight: the best steak I've ever had was the rib eye from Radish and Rye, and this place came so close it's almost (but not quite) a coin toss between the two.  The service was amazing, and we were seated on the patio with an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains. The cocktails were fantastic as well.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I spontaneous picked this place to celebrate my birthday. I honestly am super thrilled that we ended up with this place because the food, service, and ambient was perfect. I wouldn't change anything about it. Before going, I highly recommend calling in advance for reservations, since they are usually booked if you plan on walking in. However, if you're okay with sitting at the bar then go for it. Either way you will be getting stellar service. My boyfriend ordered the scallops and I got the sea bass. We are both pretty picky when it comes to our seafood, especially my boyfriend. To complete our meal we also decided to share the truffle mashed potatoes.  Although it did take some time for the food to arrive, I was pleased with every dish. The sea bass was cooked to the perfect temperature and moisture, the fish itself was full of flavor. Every cut flaked so easily, I was super impressed. The mashed potatoes were full of flavor, but beware this is very heavy. I recommend sharing it since the pot it quite big. My boyfriend said his scallops were okay, towards the end it got too rubbery. We asked if we could swap one of the scallops for another one since it was overcooked. Ten minutes later our server came back and said they chef didn't know how else to cook it and he was sorry. Instead of offering us a new dish, they decided to comp that dish. We were surprised and didn't want that gesture. We were in no way trying to get a free meal, but they insisted to comp the dish.  To end the perfect night, they gave me three cute truffles to celebrate my big day.  Overall, I love how they put customers first. I would highly recommend this place if you love seafood. I can't wait to come back to try their steaks.",

Prime Restaurant is located right on the water facing the Bellagio fountains which is a huge plus. Who wouldn't enjoy a wonderful meal with a spectacular view? The restaurant Dinning room is just breathtaking, glamorous and very intimate.   Food:  To start the bacon wrapped shrimp which was outstanding. They were very good. Came with 3 shrimp and since I was dinning with a friend we got and extra one so we wouldn't fight over who got the 3rd shrimp lol.  Next The wedge, which was really good, perfect amount of blue cheese and the dressing was creamy and just yummy.  Entrees: 10oz fillet, and the peppercorn streak. Both were unbelievable. Very flavorful and my god my fillet was like butter it just melted in your mouth. we were given 3 different sauces to accompany our steaks: green peppercorn, bernaise and a rice soy. The rice soy was my favorite i didn't care for the other 2. For sides, Mac and cheese which was also very good - creamy and gooey.  For Desert the cinnamon bread pudding. I will admit it didn't look anything like what you'd expect for a bread pudding. Definitely wasn't your traditional bread pudding but irregardless it was very good.  Overall just a wonderful experience. Totally worth the $$$$.  Also the Service was stellar and exceptional.",

And big servings too- I had to save some for later. The restaurant was all around beautiful with a classy ambience mood to it.

This was my 11th visit to Vegas, third visit to Prime. Impeccable service and delicious food every single time. Yes it's pricey, but the setting and occasion was well worth it.   We were a table for 9 and my request for the best table outdoors with a view of the Bellagio fountains was graciously granted. The custom chocolate ganache cake I ordered was the \"icing on the cake\" {pun intended}. Loved it so much that I made it my profile picture here on Yelp.  If I may make one suggestion, perhaps additional speakers need to be added in the outdoor patio. The songs accompanying the fountain show are difficult to hear over the noise generated by the fountains themselves.   Can't wait to visit you again! Thank you Prime!",

    "text": "Disappointing experience.    I read the requests and opted for the steakhouse and was excited to try it.    After scheduling the reservation, and requesting that my party have a view of the fountain, and then confirming that on arrival 30 min prior to the reservation, we were sat far from the windows overlooking the iconic water show.   Okay, that isn't a huge issue but a disappointment.    The wait wasn't bad for the table.  Only about 10-15 over the reservation time, and nothing memorable in good or bad ways   From that.   The service was a little more aggressive with suggestions that I'm used to at a restaurant of this caliber, seemed to suggest more carbs for sides that offer suggestions on steak.  My party (5 in total) ordered steaks all around.   The filet was over cooked for one of my guests, the rare New York was a med rare.   My dry aged rib eye was also over cooked, medium rare at best, and very fatty.  I like my steaks and am picky about them, and was disappointed at the quality of the cut.  For a Prime steak, it was a let down.   On a positive the sides were good.  The Brussel sprouts were good, Mac and cheese was amazing.   The attention from the server was on point, with refills and brought various dipping sauces for the steaks.  Which was different, and seemed that it might be used to mask the taste of the steak.     After spending over $650 for dinner for 5, and leaving with a meh.. taste, im thinking there's other spots I'd rather go to especially with the pricing.   Oh... and the pricing online is significantly less on the menu, creating a \"oh, pricing went up..\" moment for one of my guests.",

Our server I believe his name was Julio was very helpful and delivered excellent service. The food was amazing and we left extremely satisfied! My boyfriend ordered the short ribs which were perfect and I ordered the peppercorn crusted sirloin (which was massive). The views and ambiance of this restaurant truly makes it spectacular and seta the tone for a loving evening. As for our anniversary we requested a table with views of the water and I was absolutely blown away by the spectacular views. The only thing which was a disappointment was a lack of celebration for our anniversary, I've seen other reviews in which a dessert with happy anniversary is written out and that is something we did not receive. But, I'm sure we will be back for another special occasion and do truly recommend this restaurant to everyone.",

Now, just a quick bad note, my husband got the peppercorn steak, which was not great at all. A little over done and the pepper flavor over took the steak in a bad way.

Since my husband had food envy and it was a generous portion, I shared with him. This was the best lamb either of us have had.

The tables were big which is great to put all the food to share (sides are family style) but sometimes difficult to have a conversation with the person sitting accross from you. Minor details. I had the oysters for the appetizer and they were so good. Light and crisp taste, I just wish they had more oysters on the plate! The beet salad and the poele foie gras were also both delicious.  For the entree I had the lobster. It was ridiculous. There was so much meat and it was cooked just the right amount. I was so happy that day! My friend has the bone in ribeye and loved it. For the sides we had the gratin dauphinois which was our favorite, the mac and cheese (that was meh), the mushrooms, creamed spinach and brussel sprouts.  Finally for dessert we got the creme brulee and that was the perfect dish to end our lovely meal.  Really enjoyed my dining experience over there!",

    "text": "We had some money to spend with the Food & Dining Credit at the Bellagio, so we opted for the Prime Steakhouse for beau's birthday dinner. We got to sit front row at the Bellagio Fountains! Unfortunately it was too hot outside, otherwise we might have enjoyed the accompanying music also.  The first bite of everything was super delicious, in fact, I was assured that I had made the right decision on the location. It certainly had a lot of accolades on the website, highly acclaimed and even won 2014 Open Table's award. Bravo! It was love at first bite, and then, sadly, towards the end and 5 glasses of water later, not so much.  The steak was carted in with three signature sauces. I was rather glad they didn't make you choose on the spot and instead, left three small gravy boats for you to try them. Unfortunately the steak was just fine on its own, and the sauce wasn't entirely necessary. Though conclusively we decided that if you need sauce on a steak then something else entirely is prohibiting your experience...  The lamb chops were so divine at first bite, but through it all, about 40% ended up being lamb fat instead of lamb chops, and well, it just couldn't justify the amount spent on the entree. The sauce was overly salted, and thus ended up drinking 5 glasses by the conclusion of the evening. Pretty strange considering there were only three chops.  The sides however were less disappointing, I absolutely loved (and subsequently murdered) the entire ramekin of truffle mash. I highly recommend this even though the entrees themselves seemed lacking. The peas were also divine. A bit cheating with the bacon, but well put together. It was, however, a tad hard to eat due to the different shapes of peas...  Well, besides the truffle mash potatoes, the birthday dessert was divine. They had just made the lava cake and it was perfectly rich without being too sweet. The ice cream was a prefect touch. Very tasty.  Top items: Service, Truffle Mash, Free Dessert.  Needless to say, won't be back. Sure, maybe we ordered the wrong items, but just so you know, a restaurant shouldn't make bad items choices on the menu. Haha.",

Appetizer was decent.. Bacon Wrapped Shrimp, they were pretty good (far from the best I've had) but you only get 3 of them for $28, which I think is a bit ridiculous even for Vegas.   Main Course..   27 day Dry Aged Ribeye, cooked medium rare (chefs recommendation), my friend said it was quite fatty/gritty.. there was about 4oz or so left on his plate at the end of the meal that was all fat. He rated it a 6.5/7... he ate he a few years ago & had the A5 Wagyu & said it was out of this world, but this time wasn't the happiest, but wasn't too upset either.   Filet Mignon, cooked medium.. it was excellent, tender, cooked perfect & the bernaise sauce was good as well, wasn't too crazy about the other 2 steak sauces they brought out.   Sides were 50/50... the onion rings were good & so was the truffle mash potatoes.. however the \"special\" Lobster MAC & Cheese was simply bland, it lacked a lot of flavor & cost $22.. disappointing.   Also, they had a surf & turf \"special\" tonight for $154... the lobster tail & filet mignon are both on the menu & if you buy them both straight from the menu it is the roughly the same price (within $5 or so).. great \"special\".",

    "text": "Last time I came in it was with my wife and 2 friends and had the most unpleasant service I have ever experienced in my life to the point that I think it was done on purpose. We came in just before dinner, right after they opened and after walking the strip so we weren't in suits and jackets but we were still served. I feel like the waiter probably thought \"These guys wont tip\" or something so didn't really serve our table like he should have. Food was good, but the waiter was bad and it was the ONLY time in my entire life where I did NOT tip the waiter a decent tip because I felt he wasn't deserving of it. As we were leaving the same waiter ran up to us to offer the small tip we left in tip claiming 'we forgot our change.' I politely told him that he can keep it and walked out.  Also, we were not acting obnoxious or loud or being a problem to any one so there was no reason to act the way like he did towards us.  We were not even drinking alcohol - in fact one of my complaints is that I enjoyed a nice juicy steak with just a cup of ice that I had to chew since I drank my water before the steak arrived and the waiter was asked 3x to refill my glass.  I didn't bother on telling one there because I felt like that him and the host were talking about us so I felt like there wasn't anyone to complain to. After leaving, I choose never to stop in again and I probably wont.    The food is worth a 4.5 star review itself because I actually did enjoy the dinner but after being served that bad, I thought a 2 star review was deserving enough.  Food was excellent but service was bad.",

After being told they're running behind and waiting, we were taking to a table in the very back corner of the restaurant with zero view of the fountains. I asked the person seating us if there were other tables available with an actual view since we just got engaged and were there to celebrate. I was given a rude response saying there were others in front of us waiting and it would be an extra hour wait. We ended up walking out and going somewhere else. Guess this isn't the place to go if you're young & newly engaged. I was very disappointed in how we were treated and will not be going back here.",

    "text": "This was a very disappointing experience comparing to other steakhouse we've been to in Vegas. I made reservations to this steakhouse for our anniversary this pass weekend with a couple of friends. We were expecting to have an amazing dinner with our friends especially for the money we were going to spend. Steak was not juicy or flavorful not even cooked with any care for flavor (salt or pepper) I guess that's why they give you three different steak sauces. Anyone knows that a good cooked steak will never need to add sauce to make it taste good. What made this worst was a twelve dollar coke. I'm pretty sure with the food price they could afford free refills. They might want to check with Outback on how to cook a better steak. Yes Outback taste better then this steakhouse. I'm sorry to our friends who had to experience this with us.   For those who need a GREAT steakhouse I strongly recommend Charlie Palmer at the Four Seasons or Strip Steak at the Mandalay Bay.",

    "text": "I wish I could eat this meal every day! (Though it would be horrible for the waistline)  Had the opportunity to sit out in the patio where you have front row seats (from the back) of the fountain show.  The location was enough to make this a 5 star location.  Every 15 minutes, you are enchanted by the fountains of Bellagio.  What else do you need?  You can get full of that! But luckily, this place serves amazing food as well.  Seafood Platter:  A medley of raw oysters, raw clams, lobster, king crab legs, mussels, shrimp and a mixture of dipping sauces.  The oysters were extremely fresh and sweet.  The lobster was cooked well.  Not chewy.  The king crab legs were brine-y but also sweet in flavor.  The shrimp may have been one of the best shrimp cocktails I have ever had.  Filet Mignon: Ordered medium rare and it came out medium rare.  What a shocker.  No matter where I go, it's always so hard to get a steak delivered to your preference.  The meat was tender, not salty.  Dip it in their special soy dipping sauce, which the waiter said goes well with anything, and you are in carnivore heaven. After the platter,  you don't have any more space for the whole filet but you will want to eat it all.  Truffle Mashed Potatoes:  Creamy, rich goodness with the essence of truffle throughout.  SOOOO Good.  A must try when you are there.  Sprinkles of truffle on top.  Be shady and just scoop the top layer so you can get all the truffle flavor that your taste buds can handle.  The service was also amazing.  Waiters (and waitresses) were very attentive: always refilling water, refilling wine, providing details of the dishes and always asking if everything is OK.  Very polite and also very personable.  Had a great time at Prime.  The location was already amazing but the food and service topped it all off.",

    "text": "We booked this restaurant way in advance to make sure that we got our reservation. Party of 6 fountain view. One couple celebrating their Honeymoon and the other two couples were celebrating birthdays. We got the perfect seats. However, when it came to the food, it was not what it's hyped up to be and exceedingly expensive for the taste. I had the 10oz filet Oscar. My hubby had the dry bone in rib eye Oscar. Now, we have had both of the dishes in many other restaurants. We consider ourselves foodies. Oscar is always crab with hollandaise and usually asparagus. Therefore, it's nice and saucy. This however was crab and breading. They said it has hollandaise but it was dry. The fact that you pay $30 something for it was not worth it. The steak was not as tender as I normally get it butterflied and very well done. Many will say like a hockey puck but that's how I eat it. I ALWAYS order it this way and it still comes out tender at Council Oaks, Ruth Chris's, Bern's. Morton's and Fleming's. However, not here. It was an experience but a very expensive experience.  Not nearly worth the quality of the food. The best thing we're the mushrooms. These were DELICIOUS. When we normally get mushrooms, it's just cooked in a sauce. These were in a buttery sauce and they were different kinds of mushrooms. They were quite tasty. At the end, it really wasn't worth the $250 plus that we paid.  PS- I got the Almond Brulee to go because I was sooo stuffed since I've have bariatric surgery (the sleeve). I did not feel well at all after eating it. I had to throw half of it away and felt nauseous the rest of the night. It has nothing to do with the surgery because I can eat sugar with the sleeve.",

The excuse was that charring 'cooked off' all the seasoning (not how charring works) rather than just admitting they forgot to season it - it's not a big deal people make mistakes. They brought me another steak and way overcorrected, this time it was completely briny.  What's worse is that they kept telling me to try the multitude of sauces they brought out, which I did try - they weren't that special.

    "text": "Two standouts: foie gras appetizer and the house photographer. So, first, an embarrassing confession--no one at our table ordered red meat. I should have ordered the special of the night: a bone-in filet. Instead, I started off with a craving for duck, but our server squashed that desire by telling me that the duck l'orange was prepared in slices and did not have a crisp skin And he hadn't heard many good comments about it. He recommended the pork chop, so I got that, and I regretted it. When the server inquired how my pork chop was, I told him it was just ok--did not have much flavor. the accompanying mushrooms, on the other hand, were delicious. The server said, \"well at least you like one of the things, right? \" Uh, okay... I really didn't expect him to do anything, and yes, I was the dunce ordering a non-steak dish in a steakhouse, but our server's lack of concern over my enjoyment was a little disappointing. I've actually had better service at The Outback. And, we overheard the server at a nearby table say, \"Whatever you want, I will make it right for you\". Wished we had gotten that guy.  As an aside, my family always stays at the Bellagio, and service at this hotel overall is at a pretty high standard, so I guess I was expecting more out of this restaurant--it was our first time here. The interior looks like Sleeping Beauty's chamber with powdery blue drapes. The music is really awful--I just have to point this out, and it is disappointing that they don't have a cocktail menu. Crab cakes were very good, and the sea bass was cooked perfectly with a lovely, delicate, slightly gingery sauce. Potatoes au gratin were rich! Butter & cheese galore. Ginger sweet potatoes were silky smooth and had just the right amount of sweetness. Sorbet looked much better than it tasted--perfectly scooped orbs, but the mango was too tart, coconut did not taste like coconut. The house photographer (who looked just like Wendy Malick from Just Shoot Me) took gorgeous pictures of my family--she really directed us--made us get out of our seats, place our hands just so...my father has stage 4 cancer, so this is why the photos meant a lot to us. Will not return to this restaurant and can't say I would recommend it, but I savored every bite of my foie gras and we'll cherish our pictures.",

Also, for some reason I find it insanely cheesy when they have the photographers running around from table to table taking professional photos and asking for $30 each. You just ruined my steak and want to charge me $30 for ONE single photograph?   Tip - ignore their dress code of \"jackets preferred for men.\" This must be a joke. The place was packed when we got there and not one guy was wearing a jacket. We did see one guy in a wife beater, another in sweat pants, and another in shorts (supposedly not allowed).",

    "text": "My family and I went to Prime this weekend and thought that we were going to be in for a treat - we scored a table last minute on the beautiful patio and could not wait for our food.  The problem was all we did was wait - 20 minutes for water, 60 minutes for bread, and we had to ask twice to order wine and our food...you get the picture.    After over an hour had gone by and we still did not have our appetizers - one french onion soup and one Caesar salad - my sister and I finally went into the restaurant and asked to speak with the manager.  After briefly explaining the situation to the manager, he informed us he would \"look into it.\"  As we returned to our table, we found that our appetizers had finally made it.  The french onion soup had good flavor but was really greasy.  The Caesar salad was extremely bland.    As we were taking our first bites of the appetizers, we saw the manager pop his head out on the balcony and presumed that he was coming to speak to us.  Instead, he never came back.  At this point, we were all happy to have a bit of food and prepared to sit back, relax and enjoy the entrees with our wine.  Again, we were disappointed as the entrees took much longer than expected to arrive.  When they finally did arrive, we were surprised to find that the food was pretty terrible.  The salmon was woefully undercooked (more than raw in the middle). The sea bass was far overcooked, chewy and fishy.   The seared tuna appeared to be covered in some sort of batter and flash fried.  The chicken entree was just blah.  Though we were starving, not a one of us came close to finishing our meal.   Given the disappointing service and food, we asked to speak with the manager again.  When he approached our table, I asked why he had never spoken to us the first time - he mentioned that he saw we had a our starters and thought everything was fine.  After listening to our complaints on the food, he gave us a couple of excuses that really made no sense (it's a big restaurant, the patio is more relaxed).    After confirming that our experience was sub-par, he then asked what we would like him to do about of experience.  We instead asked him what he thought he should do and suggested that the restaurant at least consider correcting the bill a bit given the poor quality of the food.  We were pleasantly surprised when he returned with the bill for the wine, soup and salad only - all of the entrees had been removed.     We enjoy fine dining and thought that we had been so lucky to get into Prime - unfortunately, our night was almost ruined by this experience.  I would prefer to give this restaurant no stars because everything was just so terrible from the food to the service to the manager's response.  However, I to give the restaurant credit for two things - the manager properly adjusted the bill so that we did not feel like we had been robbed and the atmosphere is quite lovely.  Would I go back? No, but if you decide to go, stick with a couple of drinks and a fun appetizer or two and then move on to a restaurant with more consistent food.",

He truly out did himself and they suprised me with a delicious chocolate desert.  I highly recommend this place to anyone celebrating a special occasion, although I was a little dissapointed they didn't offer to take a commemorative picture for us to by like they did the bachelor party at the table next to us.",

The restaurant itself is beautiful and the ambience is perfect in that it is not loud at all.  My friend and I both had the Bone-In Rib Eye, 18 oz - $58. A bit pricey. It was good, we both said a B-B+. Not amazing. We went for that cut as it was wet-aged and we are not fans of dry aged which they had 2 of on the menu.  The Mac and Cheese was amazing, full of Gouda goodness. We had crispy potatoes which is a twice baked potato covered in cheese and bacon. It's a glorified potato skin. Avoid it.  The bread selection was nothing special.  I had the warm chocolate cake, a molten lava chocolate creation with a tiny scoop of vanilla bean. Average.  We escaped for under $200 as we had no alcohol. I'd go back there but certainly recommend CUT, Mastros and Morels before Prime.",

In terms of sides, I really enjoyed the herbed fries -- they were quite tasty and a good complement to the steak. Dito on the house steak sauce -- it was the best of the four sauces they presented.  Oddly enough, the highlight of the meal was the seafood platter appetizer -- huge crab legs and lots of lobster. Very tasty.  They should maybe rethink the name and change it to (sub) Prime or something -- a steak house should excel at steaks.",

I made the reservation and then called a couple days ahead of time to request a window seat (we wanted to watch the Bellagio fountains while we ate). The man said he would try but he couldn't promise anything, so I wasn't expecting anything. But they had our window table for two all ready when we showed up!  If you are looking for a fantastic steak, amazing service and an impressive wine list, this is it. Everyone from the hostess to the wait staff to the bus boys were attentive and polite and made us feel very welcome. As a couple in their young 20s on a budget, we appreciated how welcoming they were. It was one of the most expensive meals I have ever payed for (and we picked one of the the lesser expensive \"budget\" bottles on the wine list) so we were looking to be pampered. The employees at Prime did not disappoint. The food was even better! I had the Boston lettuce salad, 18oz. bone-in ribeye. She had the caesar salad and the 8oz. filet mignon. We shared the garlic mashed potatoes and chile broccoli. I am not a huge fan of buttery mashed potatoes but this bowl was pretty incredible. For dessert we shared a special anniversary lava cake and vanilla ice cream. They spelled out \"Happy Anniversary\" on the plate in chocolate syrup, and it was on the house!  I wish I could remember the name of our waiter. I want to say it started with a J (Joseph, maybe?). Anyway, he's probably mid-40s, and I do remember that his nametag says he's from Costa Mesa, CA. Leave him a good tip because he deserves it.  Can't wait to go back.  One FYI (not really a complaint) -- they prefer the men to wear jackets, but they don't have a coat check.",

    "text": "Lauren C's review of Prime described her waiter as a \"Jeeves Wannabe,\" and she couldn't have been more correct.  And when I told the Sommelier I was taking the Level 2 exam after passing Level 1, but that I wasn't a \"real\" sommelier at the time, he practically scoffed.  The correct response is: \"Good luck!\"  I told the same thing to the Sommelier at Gary Danko last week, and he gave me his business card and asked how he could help.  THAT is how you treat a customer!  Being a top-service-rated restaurant, even if it's super-high-end, means having servers that are professional, and knowledgable, but also cool and who act like \"real people\" at the same time  Example:  Go to Gary Danko.  It's a high end establishment, but people are just cool.  No snootiness, and they have a natural flow to how they interact, with a sense of humor as well.  Perhaps I was at Prime on an off-night, but other reviews have confirmed the same attitude.  To Bellagio's credit, however, I must say that my experience at Picasso two years ago was unbelievable, and the service at Picasso blew me away.  Furthermore, the wine pairing at Picasso was one of the best I've encountered in my life.  My Prime experience was overall a good one, saved by the bartender (I had a glass of wine at the bar before dinner, he picked one blind and I guessed it), and the unbelievable bone-in filet.  There was a little too much \"rub\" on the filet, as I'm a pureist with my steaks (like to have several bare bites before I go to sauces).  That said, I did try the four homemade sauces, which are pretty incredible:  bernaise, soy reduction, a mustard sauce, and peppercorn.  The bone-in filet is ginormous, and is an amazing cut of meat.  At $60, it's probably the best bargain on the menu, because a cut of that quality and size is very rare.  Wine list is great, although they only have one Rioja; which shouldn't be the case with a list of that size.",

The only thing that really saved the night was the awesome company; my BF, his family and our casino host.  I really wanted to love this place, the setting is amazing and so is the decor.  First, we made reservations for eight o'clock, but when we arrived on time the table was not set. We ended up standing around for ten minutes. Keep in mind it was a birthday dinner for my BF's mom and our casino host was eating with us. You would think the employees of Prime would have their shit together since the restaurant was not even that busy.   After being seated our waiter was horrible.  I ordered a glass of champagne and he forgot it, not once but three different times! Mine was not the only beverage he forgot on more than one occasion.  Our table of eight ordered the shell fish appetizer, which cost around four hundred dollars. The crab, shrimp and oysters were good but the lobster was awful. It was chewy and flavorless.  Seriously about an hour after we had our appetizer our main courses come out. Our table ordered everything from the duck, to sea bass to stake, no one was that thrilled. The food was mediocre, defiantly not worth the price.   The kicker to the entire night was \"dress code\".  They are suppose to enforce a dressy attire and yet I saw guys in Affliction shirts and girls in jean skirts.   Moral of the story, save you money and eat at one of the other amazing restaurants in the Bellagio.",

I have heard both positive and negative and being in the Bellagio hotel you would think that it would be great! I had the filet, garlic potatoes and mushrooms that we both shared. And my husband had some other cut. (cant remember exactly what) But obvioulsy it wasnt too good considering that early Saturday morning he was in the bathroom and it was not pretty! Basically our entire trip was ruined from this so called wonderful steakhouse. NEVER again will I come back to this place. It obviously was food poistening.

The decor was pretty nice - has a nice view of the fountains, not as nice as the view from Picasso, but ok.  The filet mignon was cooked well, but the flavor was lacking especially from a steak that is supposed to be prime quality.  The sides were just ehh... the citrus glazed baby carrots ended up being large carrots cut up into little strips - not impressive.  The dungeness crabcake appetizer was also disappointing - being a little too fried and lacking in flavor - definitely not worth the price.  Also tried the diver scallops with sweet pea ravioli - the scallops were overcooked and the vinaigrette sauce was way too overpowering for the dish.  The service was also a bit lacking - not of the quality that one would expect when eating at a high end steak restaurant.  Overall, would not go back",

Great ambiance and very hefty price tag. Magnificently appointed from the small 8 seat bar when you first walk in to the large tables placed not to closely with views of the fountains through the large picture windows its pure Vegas.   Table for 9 on this Saturday night and we are given a large round table where we are seated very comfortably.   Fresh baskets of bread, pretzel bread, are a nice start as we peruse this shall we say ok no way around it Ridiculously overpriced menu. There I said it.   The wine list is long as it is equally if not one of the most expensive wine lists I've ever seen.  In fact most were 300% mark up.  There was an exceptional vintage a 2008 Justin Isosceles which for $131.00 was simply marked up 110% which made it the best value on the entire list.   Note 5 bottles were consumed tonight.  The menu itself is your typical steaks & chops menu with some fish thrown in.   Don't think I'll be able to get to each appetizer and entree but I'll try.   Appetizer Highlights:   Shrimp Cocktail exceptional, Cesar Salad authentic and outstanding. Special tonight Burrata cheese over watercress was really unbelievably good, A dungeous crab cake also as good it gets.  Knocks off for poor Seared Foie Gras.   Entrees:  NY Strip Dry aged incredibly tasty and cooked  to perfection but the typical dry aging left it no juice whatsoever.  (8) out of 10   (2) Small Bone in Rib Eye with Shishito peppers was tasty with just enough marble to give it some excellent secondary flavor (10)  Rack of Colorado Lamb was simply killer, not gamey and rich in color texture and taste. (10)  Prosciutto wrapped pork chop was dry and lacked flavor (5) Nice looking but didn't get it done.  Pan Roasted Dover Sole was fresh and tasty but completely overpriced at $65.00 (7)  Veal Chop was grilled and tasty and hanging off the bone as it should be.  Very rich flavor (10)  Filet Mignon with Shishito peppers everything a filet should be and then some (even for my friend who tried to ruin it by ordering it medium well :(   (10)  Sides:  Mashed Yukon Gold Potatoes (6) Nothing special  Baked Potatoes large giant with all the fixings (10)  Mac & Cheese crusty topping and rich and creamy underneath (10)  Creamed Spinach lacking that extra kick (6)  Glazed Mushrooms again nothing special bland (6)  No Deserts were tried.  Service was exceptional throughout the meal from every direction.    Bottom line is was the price tag worth it?  Really borderline as almost every entree except the Sole was top shelf, and the appetizers were great. Ambiance, service exceptional as well.  Negatives All but 1 of hundreds of wines were so overpriced we were lucky to find a bottle to order.  Sides and prices of entrees were completely outrageous.  Kind of a 4 star if you have unlimited spending in your budget as it certainly was not a 100% slam dunk perfection and 1 star off for price points and wine list.  3.5 stars is more like it but we have to be fair.",

    "text": "Famous rock-star chef Jean-Georges causes foodies to swoon just hearing his first name. With his three-star Michelin achievement comes a strong-willed Alsatian background with culinary history running through his veins. It wasn't a difficult decision to end our gustatory Valentine's Day weekend with a dinner at Prime, located in the Bellagio Hotel, which in 'Vegas' means a long walk through a smoky casino. You sink to a new low trudging in four-inch heels with your man to Prime steakhouse. You don't have to lower your standards, but you do have to descend physically down long corridors to the lower level of the hotel. The hike is well worth the effort as it allows you to dine while gazing out multi-paned French windows at the legendary and talented dancing fountains in Bellagio lake that perform every fifteen minutes or so they say. More about that later.  Prime's chichi eatery shows some of the refinement of an Eastern chophouse - dark, warm colors, comfy chairs and crisp white tablecloths. But it is also True to its Vegas-baby location, displaying just the right amount of glitz, bling and smarmy opulence which the owners designate as chocolate brown and \"delicate Tiffany blue decor\" the elaborate design of Michael DeSantis. Chef Jean-Georges has two establishments in Las Vegas, the other is his self-named steakhouse at the Aria, plus over two dozen additional upscale restaurants scattered throughout the world.  Once seated at our \"ring-side\" table we were greeted with a complimentary champagne cocktail and a timely explosion from the star of the show, which interrupted our intimate moments more than once. We timed the intervals and they were irregular between 5 and 6 eruptions an hour. To be honest, after a couple of acts, I was more taken by a family of ducks cruising around the lake seemingly unaware of the carnage going on around them.  We sipped our champagne, toasting one another in between kisses before we picked up the comprehensive steakhouse menu loaded with starters, soups, salads, steak, seafood, sauces and sides, and began to ask our server questions. Our Captain had been with Prime since the day Bellagio opened in 1998, so his knowledge was immense and he would toss in a bit of trivia or add an aside of history with every answer and explanation. We looked at each other, and agreed by telepathy that this was our guy. So, we gave him free rein to order for us. We were not disappointed.  For a first course, he brought us a classic presentation of luxurious, ostentatious and pretentious golden Osetra caviar. It was to die for. Chilling in a large bowl of meticulously hand-cracked ice lay a tiny cup of silky grey-gold gems destined to be scooped onto silver-dollar buckwheat blinis with a mother of pearl spoon. The accompaniments made the deliciousness stretch to last as long as possible-- minced red onion, chopped hard-cooked egg yolks and whites, creme fraiche, lemon, capers and chives. Oh my! I guarantee that after a few minutes of caviar--feeding-frenzy there was not a single sumptuous ovum left in sight.  After basking in the afterglow, over a cleared and meticulously crumb scraped table, the salad was delivered. For this, our server had recommended the roasted beets with apple, ricotta and quinoa. It was perky and tasty, but certainly not as amazing as course one, so we concentrated on the wine. We had ordered The Prisoner, a personal favorite since Consort once won a bottle at a pizza cooking party (but that is a whole 'nother story), a trendy red blend of Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Petite Sirah, and Charbono.  The main course came with a flourish, three varieties of A5 Japanese Wagyu beef, filet, strip and ribeye, to be carved tableside and presented with simple vegetables and bearnaise, peppercorn and rice wine sauces. Some people call this Kobe beef, because of its relation to the city of Kobe, Japan. Prime more accurately labels it as Wagyu, or Japanese Black Beef, and the A5 designation translates as \"best of the best.\" However, as it is with most \"done three ways\" offerings, one way is always better than the other two. In this case it was the filet - the ribeye and the strip both seemed to need an extra minute on the fire. Our server had recommended a pair of sides for the main course, Brussels sprouts with maple-roasted quince and hunks of bacon, gnocchi and mushrooms in a gouda fondue. Both were good, but a bit too heavy handed after all the previous viands.  Our Captain, along with server and busser teamed up and would not allow us to leave without one complimentary anniversary dessert, so they brought two - an amazing cheesecake with pineapple snow and a chocolate bombe that melted under a pour of warm caramel sauce to reveal a prize inside. They were ambrosial, but the gesture was all too Vegas - a redundancy of lavish excess. We capped off the night with a Canadian classic, a rich, sweet and indulgent flavorful icewine.   I am the DinnerSlut.",

I expected alot more from the service. We had to tell our waiter we were ready to order appetizers, which arrived before he came back to take our main order. So we were sitting there with our menus trying to hold them and eat our apps, waiting to do our main order. Service was painfully slow but was ok because we got to watch more of the show. Know that inside the restaurant, you cant hear the music for the fountain. Food was good but not great. Filet was tender and cooked perfectly but not alot of flavor.  They were accommodating for a gluten allergy and even brought gf bread to the table. I just expected outstanding service for that price and was disappointed. If we hadn't set outside,  I would of felt ripped off.",

The staff attended to our table frequently and were able to accommodate all our drink and meal requests.  We enjoyed some martinis and started off with some of the best oysters I've ever head.  I don't recall the name, but they were from New Brunswick and were amazing.  Our salad had fresh tomatoes and cheese we really enjoyed and our bone-in rib eye was cooked perfectly.  We were not rushed at all, and actually our waiter asked us in the beginning if we were in a hurry to catch a show so he could let the kitchen know.

Mushrooms were seasoned to perfection and not overly greasy either. Nothing like a perfect dinner while watching the fountains outside.

The service was polished and professional and the food was amazing.  We started with the shrimp cocktail and the crab cake...both solid choices that could have been a meal in themselves.  I enjoyed the halibut entree and my friend enjoyed the sole entree - both flavorful, fresh and delicious.  We shared a side of the ginger sweet potatoes and loved them - absolutely divine!  The Rouge cocktail was the way to go too.   If you're looking for an amazing meal in a sophisticated atmosphere with a view of the fountains, Prime is the place for you!",

The service was very good and the waters were curteous and on it. I was not impressed with the food. It was \"ok\" at best. We had dinner at smith and wolensky and it was much better than here at prime.  My boyfriend had the ribeye it was ok but nothing spectacular. I had the sea bass and once again it was ok. They said the sides would be family style but they weren't. The scalloped potatoes was barely enough for one and the onion rings were cold. The glass of wine I had was a Riesling wine and about choked when I saw it was $19 and it wasn't that great neither. For the amount of money the food is not worth it. The atmosphere perfection....food not so much. We won't be back.",

    "text": "came here for a special dinner this past Saturday. I made reservations a few days in advance for a table for two at 7pm in front of the fountains.   The day of , i came in two hours earlier before going to the spa to show my noir card as the person who took my reservation suggested to ensure the fountain view. They said no guarantees but they will try..  At 7 we came in and had to wait an additional 20 minutes. No big deal.   Our waiter was a bit awkward. He seemed to be in character of an over anxious server in a semi mocking way. Almost like Geoffrey from fresh prince of bel air. I also noticed he didnt speak like that to any of the other tables he served, his tone of voice and personality completely changed. But he remained in this character for our table. When he approached us he didn't introduce himself or ask how we were. Just asked if we were ready to order drinks from out of nowhere.   We ordered the aged rib eye, short ribs, shrimp cocktail , and truffle mashed potatoes.   The short ribs were so soft and tender. It was probably the stand out if the dishes we ordered. The shrimp cocktail came with four shrimps that were basically the size of baby lobsters i felt. Very meaty and enjoyable.   The aged rib eye was good but left me wanting for a bit more. When i bit into it i couldnt help but think this was a somewhat mediocre steak. The three sauces it came with were fun, but i was slightly disappointed in the steak itself.   The truffle mashed potatoes were good but very whipped, borderline runny; maybe more than what I'm used to. But the truffle flavor was definitely there.    We sat smack in the front of the fountains in the inside of the restaurant. During winter months it can be a bit cold. All in all im glad i tried this place out. However , i think one time is enough for me.",

    "text": "This was just fantastic.  Ate with a group of 6 and had impeccable service.  Water and wine glasses never left wanting.  The restaurant is very classic and demure.  And, as many note, you can see the fountains well from some tables.  On to the food:  We had the seafood tower.  Usually, the lobster is the star, but in this one, it was the crab for me.  The shrimp were perfectly cooked.    Crabcakes was probably the most disappointing dish.  Serviceable, but not what I expected.  Had several sides.  The stars were mac n cheese and onion rings.  Will defintely get these 2 dishes again.  My wife had the filet and lobster.  Filet cooked PERFECTLY rare.  This was textbook, and no black on the outside, which was a feat for such a thick steak.  The lobster was one of the best I have had.  I had the bone-in ribeye, which was another perfect medium rare.  Excellent flavor, the dry aging came through.  The wine list is extensive, and pricey.  We had Italian at our table and all choices were excellent.  Port for dessert was actually not as bad price wise.  But, expect to pay if you are a wine drinker, as is common on the Strip.  Overall, a very expensive evening but one that we will do again.  If you are a steak fan, highly recommended.  I will say, the bathrooms were underwhelming for such a nice place.",

He also noticed the military imprint on my rewards card and gave us a military discount, without us having to ask. I ordered the filet and it was one of the best steaks I have ever had. It was melt in your mouth tender. My husband had the New York strip and he really liked it. Everything is expensive, but the sides are big enough to share.

    "text": "Well, this is a first for me, in writing a review where the experience was so poor on entry to engaging the restaurant that I can't even comment on the food.  Tonight is our 10 year anniversary, so I thought it fitting that we go to an iconic location while in Las Vegas, The Bellagio.  Prime is their center field front row top steak restaurant, or so they market themselves.  The idea is a traditional steakhouse in an ideal setting with indoor and outdoor dining while viewing the majestic Bellagio fountains.  I took the time to call this afternoon and secure a late reservation (9:30pm) indicating clearly the importance of the date and asking for a special location.  When we arrived, after walking through the Bellagio AKA Grand Central Station meets Disneyland's crowd, we approached the hostess stand.  Now a restaurant selling itself as a top notch experience should have a direct human interaction upon entry, not two teenage girls working behind a desk.  Worse, what clearly must have been the assistant manager walked past us, ignoring us on the way to take a phone call that was obviously more important than acknowledging their guests.  While we stood there dressed in suit and my wife's beautiful gown, we endured the conversation that consumed the attention of both \"hostess\" explaining to the fat man in shorts and an untucked polo shirt, that he was welcome to come in later but needed to wear pants.  Now at this point I have to laugh at the irony. Clearly Prime's reputation is strong enough from a perception standpoint to bring clients in, and the stuffy 'dress code' is there to enhance the \"exclusivity\" if you will. All the while the service is worse than the worst McDonalds restaurant. What a joke.  We finally connected with one of the hourly employees at the front counter and they proceeded to try to negotiate with me about wether we had actually requested an outside table or not. It was the equivalent of a conversation with a night club promoter about what it would take to get he table you want. Happy Anniversary I guess...   The good news is we went to the bar where a very friendly, competent and quality old school bartender provided real service. We ordered a glass of champagne, settled the check and informed person number 6 that I had to interact with that we would be going elsewhere.  They quickly back peddled, all of a sudden a front row table outside was available.  I politely informed them that we would be going elsewhere.  The four employees were huddling around with the real manager and watching to see what we would do. I doubt they expected that I would take the time to share the truth about the experience on line.  Look, here is the bottom line. When you are heading out to an expensive dinner, especially for an important event, and preparing to spend a considerable amount of money, you deserve the absolute best service and mentality. There's no entitlement here. Just because your restaurant is overlooking the Bellagio fountains doesn't mean it's automatically any better than a revolving restaurant exploiting its view to sell you overpriced food.  The restaurant is down stairs from the Bellagio Esplanade, it's a stuffy, dark, cave like environment with a very heavy small of cooked and worked over food. Think senior retirement center cafe with expensive decor.  If you want my advice, there are a dozen steak houses in town, all much better in every way. I would recommend the SW at Wynn or Carnevino at Pallazo. Of course I can't speak to the food since I couldn't stand the mentality. I can only tell you about the smell and the attitude. Both stink.  Try the bar I guess then high tail it out of there before they take your cash and feed the snob beast.  Better luck elsewhere.",

My family went for dinner on Christmas Eve and everything was just so well done it is difficult to express just how good it was.  Firstly the bread that comes is exquisite, there is a compilation of breads with a chive salt and butter and the rolls are hot and fresh and perfect.  The salads seemed steep for a side salad but in reality, they are nearly a full meal in themselves and really we did not need a salad and dinner but we did not realize it would be so big.  I had the mixed fall vegetable salad and it came with a whole wheel of goat chevre with delicate vegetables in a vinaigrette.  My father  had the Caesar Salad and Butternut squash soup which were dynamite.  My mother had a truffle salad and it was just a touch woodsy for my taste.  Where this place really shines though is the steak, oh the glorious steak.  I had the mammoth 18 oz bone in ribeye cooked medium rare.  For $66 it was an absolute bargain.  The meat was so flavorful and tender and perfectly cooked, no gristle and perfect melt in your mouth fat.  My father went one bigger and had the 28oz steak and even though he had it cooked to well done it was still tender and juicy.  My mother had the Short rib which was a bit over salty but still really good and sweet.  The side dishes were also very good, the Brussel sprouts are well worth getting and the gnocchi is so soft and pillowy they are truly heavenly. We also had the macaroni and cheese which was standard fare but good and the potatoes dauphanoise which were just a bit dry and over done.   In all though for the service and truly reasonable price for the amazing meal that you get this place is well worth a visit for some special occasion, indeed I wish that I was rich enough to eat here every night I don't think I could get tired of all of the truly exceptional food and atmosphere that this place provides.",

My steak was slightly more cooked than my guests so I ended cutting off cooked pieces from the edges to share with my guest because the waiter did not come to check on our food within a reasonable amount of time.  We had wanted to do something a little nicer than the typical Ruth Chris or Morton's so we chose Prime in hopes it would be at a much higher standard.  It definitely was not!   I feel short changed with the whole experience, not just because it was pricey but because it did not end up being the special dining experience we though it would be. The service was poor and the waiter displayed an arrogant and condescending attitude during the service, which I found interesting coming from a waiter.   When I made the reservation I had requested seating either by the window or in a booth/table combo. Neither one of these requests were accommodated.   I was staying in a suite so we had requested that the under cooked steak be boxed we requested that the salmon that was ordered not to be boxed as the fish might spoil the steak and had also explained that the lobster had been entirely eaten which was clear to see . We had figured we could cook it thoroughly ourselves and have it later as a snack. When the steak was boxed it contained the waste and scraps from the lobster tail that was entirely eaten. It seemed like it was some sort of insult for requesting togo boxes. We threw the steak out.   The cost of dinner for two was $400.00. I would definitely say Prime did not live up to expectations.   Without sounding entirely negative the lobster was decent but not exemplary and the restaurant's decorations were beautiful and opulent.",

All the food was great the the few steaks we had and the tuna and all the sides were all great.  The only reason i'm not giving this place a 5 is that they have an old school dress code requiring pants and my father in law had to get a \"loaner pair\" from them.  As long as you wear pants, this place is great!!!",

    "text": "A beautifully furnished steakhouse with amazing ambience; with gorgeous drapes that hug the tall windows outside of which you can see the Bellagio water fountain show at dinner time, perfect table settings, excellent menu selections of not only steaks but also seafood and chicken entree choices, Prime is THE steakhouse to be in Vegas to celebrate a special occasion.   This is the spot where you can feel like a real adult who's \"arrived\", ready to plot your genius plans with your comrades right before (or after) you conquer the world. While there to celebrate a friend's birthday, I felt that Prime is one of the classiest places to dine, truly a creme de la creme place to celebrate any special occasion. We were treated superbly well by our server who was charming and gave sound advice as to what wines to complement with the types of entrees we planned to have as well the types of side dishes that would work best with the entrees.   Another high point was the professional photographer Grace walked among the tables offering to take (and sell framed) photographs of the patrons, and I'm so happy we took her up on the offer as her control of the lighting effects on camera, the way she was able to \"direct\" us and take the photos made us 5 already beautiful women look even better in the photos that turned out.  Her service/product provided a wonderful keepsake for all of us from this special birthday occasion. In hindsight, although I loved my 14-oz New York steak (medium well is perfect) and its soy-ginger reduction, 14-oz was definitely WAY too big for me (eyes bigger than stomach, what can I say :-).  If you are 5'6\" woman like me who usually can barely finish a 8- or 10-oz steak, I'd stick to the 8-10 oz steak selections, not to mention the super yummy sides will take up room in the belly too. Watch out for the very expensive wines (by the glass, I ordered a $40/glass Cab to go with my entree). The wine was delicious but they are definitely on the premium price side even by the glass.  Ask for corkage fee if you can bring your own wine. Overall, a beautiful place to dine with excellent food and service.  Would love to go back again.",

    "text": "This restaurant is definitely a must when visiting Las Vegas. My husband and I were referred to Prime to celebrate our anniversary, and we are so glad decided to make a reservation there. The feel is very elegant inside, yet the hostesses and servers are warm and friendly. Especially so for our server- Walter. He was incredibly friendly, chatty, and personable. We felt as if we were eating at his house with how comfortable he made us feel while dining there.  The food was as amazing as the service. Hubby had the peppercorn steak and I had the salmon. Both were melt in your mouth goodness. They also brought a few different sauces to go with the entrees, but there was no need for sauce at all. They were delicious already without anything extra.  The only thing that we felt kind of ruined the night was the photographer, Morgan. She was friendly, but it seemed forced and fake. When she came to take pics, she made it very posed and studio style right at our table. Beware- the pics are very expensive- something like $50 and up for two poses which she doesn't mention in the beginning. I've been to Morton's for a special occasion and they've taken our pic, but never charged for it. When i politely declined after she brought us the pics, she gave me a dirty look, and cold fake smile then left. It was a shame because this occurred at the end of the meal so despite the amazing experience in the beginning and the middle, the end part is now what's stuck in my head.  We will definitely return to Prime next time we're in Vegas. We will ask for Walter and make sure to decline the pics in the beginning.  Quick side note- the area where you can view the Bellagio fountains is under construction until Dec 2015. Unfortunately when I booked the reservation a month before, and confirmed the day before no one ever mentioned about the construction. The view of the fountains was one of the main reasons why I made our reservation!! It was very disappointing when the hostess informed me upon checking in. Fortunately, she put us at a table that still faced Windows looking over a part of the Bellagio lake, and ending up working out anyway since we were taken care of by Walter.",

Our waiter said that's once you cut closer to the bone it'll be med-rare but we cut the med-well steak to show him but he didn't really offer anything to compensate us.

    "text": "My friend and I had dinner here on Halloween night, 10/31/14.  We arrived without reservations!  Of course they are recommended, but we had chosen another venue and changed our minds at the last minute.  The hostess was very nice and accommodating and asked us to wait in the bar for approximately 15 minutes while a table was being readied.  That was great with us.  At the bar we enjoyed a mixed drink each.  Drinks here are about $15 pp.  We were promptly seated near the windows and had a cozy table for two.  The view onto the Strip and the Fountains of Bellagio are fantastic.  Prime is definitely an upscale venue.  We had one primary waiter and two others who assisted.  The menu is a la carte and comprehensive.  I selected the Squash Soup ($15) and it is poured into your bowl at the table.  She selected the baby Iceberg Salad ($18).  There is nothing baby about the salad; it's huge.  You will be full after eating it.  We shared and both were delicious.  For the main course we ordered the 18 oz Ribeye ($64) - just one - and I asked the waiter to split it at the table.  It was more than enough for two.  We also had the roasted Asparagus ($14), the Mushrooms (($16) and Mac and Cheese ($12).  That was too much and I told the waiter it probably was.  All of it was delicious!  The total, without tip, was $164, and that included one more mixed drink for me.  Actually, I thought the venue, service and experience overall was excellent, responsive and courteous.  The prime Ribeye was good, but not the best I've had.  I would rate it 3.5 stars, although it was cooked properly, by the time it was served, it was a bit cool.  I like a steak hot.  This was not.  I did not complain -- it was fine, just not hot.  By the time I had eaten the last morsel, it was definitely cold.  If you like rare, this is perfect for you.    I agree with the other reviewers that this is a beautiful restaurant overlooking the fountains.  During the weekend, the fountains are active every 15 minutes, so this is quite a show while you dine.  Very romantic.",

It's a very classy place and while there is no jacket required, you really should plan to dress appropriately.  As you might expect, it has wonderful ambiance and upper echelon service. The steaks are aged well and cooked to perfection. If you want surf and turf, you may have to ask for it because it's not on the menu. Usually the server will inform you though that they do offer it and quote you a price.   My buddy and I had a fantastic meal here and would definitely go back. I got a kick out of the waiter's reaction when I asked for ketchup to go with my fries. He said half jokingly, \"Here we don't call it ketchup; we call it \"sauce internationale.\" I thought that was hilarious.",

And the food items we had - dry aged prime rib, filet mignon, broccoli, French onion soup and Caesar salad - were very good. But when you're paying a couple hundred bucks for dinner, you expect great service. We had ok service, and even got our food ridiculously fast from the kitchen - almost to the point where we were skeptical of it. It literally came within 10 minutes of our ordering. Seemed odd. Our waiter was distant, unwelcoming and fairly uninterested, and it ruined our experience. So between that and the price, it's just not a great place to spend a lot of money on a meal in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Never been to Vegas until now.  Did a Top 10 search on Best Steakhouses of Las Vegas and PRIME was on all the lists.  So off we go for a dinner out with the guys.  Total of seven of us & with tax/tip added onto our bill (without any alcoholic drinks, but with 4 sodas) the total came up to $830.  Was it worth it?  Read on.  The food was the BEST!  All of our steaks were cooked to \"almost\" perfection.  I say almost because for a few of us, we ordered our steaks medium and we got medium rare.  No big deal & I can only imagine how hard it is to get a steak to be that perfectly cooked between med.rare and medium so no deduction in rating for that.  Our orders ranged from Filet Mignon (with bone attached) cuts to the traditional Rib Eye.  Sides included cream corn, caesar salad, stuffed potato, crispy potatoes, truffle mashed potatoes and onion soup.  ALL of it was superbly made.  We cannot say enough about the cream corn and truffle mashed potatoes.  The food was impeccable and the service was top notch.  One of the guys on the table has dogs so we asked for the bones to be placed in a box after our meal.  The server did one better and scooped more bones from the kitchen (that they were going to discard anyways) and packed it along with ours.  Totally cool....the dogs will be eating in heaven I tell you.  Word of warning though.....the extra condiments for your stuffed potato (sour cream, chives, bacon, cheese) are ala carte.  The water served to your table is priced per bottle.  Yup, water is not free.  And soda refills are also not free.  The soda refill charge was no real surprise to me....but the charge for the water & the condiments for the stuffed potato were, so consider yourself warned.  :)  All in all, the dinner was excellent and the restaurant is a great place to impress that special lady in your life.  The food is prepared top-notch and the service is second to none.  Will we ever go there again?  That is a definite YES.....though I might not drink so much water next time.  :)",

    "text": "In my never ending quest to find the perfect steakhouse ... I find myself this time at Jean Georges' Prime at the Bellagio.  After a rather disappointing experience at his other outpost next door, the JG Steakhouse at the Aria, I was a little skeptical to say the least ... that feeling went away the instant I entered in.  Situated \"lake-side\" next to the 2star Michelin PIcasso, Prime occupies one of the best locations in the hotel overlooking the famous fountains of the Bellagio.  If you reserve early enough you can easily request prime seating, pun intended, with a beautiful view of the lake, the fountains and the Vegas strip.    As for the food, we started with the grilled foie gras with jalapeno marmalade.  The foie was excellent and cooked to perfection ... though I must admit, I find it exceedingly difficult to use the words \"foie gras\" and \"disappointment\" in the same sentence.   We opted for the 28oz bone-in rib eye for two. Now I must say that in reviewing any steakhouse in the past, I always get the rib eye and therefore I can honestly say that I'm comparing apples to apples.  The rib eye was cooked perfectly and the table side carving was a nice and sexy touch. The beef was super tender and full of flavor with the proper amount of marbling.  The steak came with several sauces - and though I don't normally use \"sauce\" at a high end steakhouse such as Prime ... I must admit that the soy rice wine sauce gave the steak that extra punch ... that it didn't necessarily need it was more than fine the way it was.  For the sides, the truffle mash potatoes were exceptional as well as the mac and cheese ... though I more than preferred the truffled mash version at the JG Steakhouse next door.  The lemon tart dessert was a bit of an after thought ... but then again I came here for some great steak and a great steak I had.  Again, in my eternal crusade to find the perfect steakhouse ... Prime is at the moment, the undisputed leader of the pack.  The impeccable service, the elegant interior, and most importantly, the unparalleled steaks combine to truly put this place in a class of its own.  I suspect that I will no longer be trying any other steakhouses in Vegas as I have officially found my favorite steakhouse in Vegas if not the entire planet.  The bar has undoubtedly been raised by Prime.",

    "text": "I brought my wife here for our 4 year anniversary and we got a seat close to the window that looks at the Bellagio fountain. Good atmosphere and a nice restaurant inside. The service was good and the waiters were friendly. We ordered a Caesar salad to start off, which we shared and I didn't like their dressing at all. My wife got the French Onion soup which she really liked. For our main course, I ordered the Rack of Lamb which was amazing. I really liked the sauce they put on it also. My wife ordered the Ribeye which was equally as good. We also had sides of steamed asparagus and mashed potatoes which both were good. We opted for no dessert as we were pretty stuffed. I was a little surprised that the restaurant didn't do anything at our table since it was our anniversary and I let them know that when I made the reservation. Usually a nice place like this will bring you out a plate of chocolates or a small dessert but we got completely stiffed this time. Overall the dinner was pretty good, but a little pricey for what it was ($217 after tip, no wine or alcohol at all). We said that we lived the meal and the view of the Bellagio fountain, but not somewhere we would be craving to come back to.",

    "text": "Glad I wasn't looking forward to eating here, or else I would have been really disappointed. The decor, ambiance, and service was of course amazing (as in all the restaurants in the Bellagio), but the food (mainly the steak) was not on par. I had the ribeye wagyu steak and it was the worst I have ever had. It was strange, some of my pieces would be really dry and then other pieces would be overwhelmingly marbleized and fatty. I couldn't get a happy medium piece. The soy based sauce that came with it helped it a lot.  Other than that, the stone crab appetizer I had was very good and fresh. I didn't like the seared foie gras (I prefer the smooth spreadable kind, this was the lumpy really livery looking kind). I had a taste of the butternut squash soup which was excellent. The mushroom side was perfect, but the truffle mashed potatoes was lacking in truffle. For dessert I had the poached pear and the coconut souffle. The poached pear dessert seemed a little bland to me. The souffle was really good and it was nice to have a coconut variation of it. I don't think I will find my way here again (sticking with CUT next time).  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.anitaeat.com&s=14efe95c768295c052c5ff4eddff6e4d46bf1ac720e22cab1ca53e8f3aec1c76\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">anitaeat.com</a>",

    "text": "Prime Steakhouse in the Bellagio is owned by the reknowned chef Jean-George Vongerichten. I have eaten at his name-sake restaurant in New York so I was very excited to experience the food here. My overall opinion would have to be that the restaurant was good, but fell short in a few areas.  My friend and I split two dishes, the Chilean Sea Bass served over braised mushrooms, poblano peppers and dill, and the special: a bone-in filet that was dry-aged 21 days. They served our meal first, which was a little disconcerting as it was split table-side. I was slightly cringing at the thought of the other dishes getting colder while ours was being prepared. The filet was terrific, perfectly cooked and juicy, while the sea bass was good, but rather un-inspired. The mushrooms underneath the seabass were superb, however, the poblano and dill were so mild the flavors never would have been obvious to the consumer. My friend's fiance ordered the roasted duck breast with almond crust and red wine amaretto sauce. The crust was fantastic, but sadly the duck was tough. The best dish of the evening was ordered by my friend's grandma. This was the rack of lamb with smoked chili glaze and broccoli rabe. The lamb was so tender and juicy, and the inherent flavor was fantastic. Obviously it came from a really good little lamb.  As far as the sides, I would have to say they were hit and miss. The brussell sprouts were something worth going back for. They were roasted with just the right amount of char, and the use of pistachio nuts was ingenious. Execution = perfect. The sweet potato puree, which I swear also involved butternut squash, was superb, but the parmesean broccoli was painfully overcooked and the florets were cut too large for easy sharing.  All in all, I would say that Prime definitely uses great ingredients, and the food was solid, yet for the price I think one should demand more. I think this is a case of the talented, celebrity chef opening up a restaurant in Vegas because the $$$ is there (or rather, used to be there) and in the process reliquished a bit too much power to someone not as talented as themselves.",

The food was good, but not worth the almost $300 we spent on our meal (for 2 people).   The service was decent and the restaurant was pretty, but like many Vegas restaurants, I felt like they were trying too hard to set an upscale ambiance.  I should say that I don't eat steak so I am probably not the best judge of a steakhouse, but my husband ordered the filet and thought that it was just ok.  The wine list was great, but again, very expensive  I ordered: The shrimp cocktail: 4 shrimp, really good cocktail sauce, but it cost $22 Boston lettuce salad: really interesting combination of herbs, avocado, and lettuce with a tasty dressing, probably the best thing I tasted Slow baked salmon: Really good piece of salmon and cooked perfectly Creamed spinach: classic and good Mashed potatoes: very buttery and addictive",

    "text": "This has been my third experience with Prime. I guess I will look for something else. Honestly the only draw here is to dine by the fountain which I guess I would advise to maybe try one of the other restaurants in the Bellagio or watch the show from the street a couple of times and get your fix. Prime markets itself as an upscale steakhouse, they have a dress code that is barely enforced. They may need to revisit this policy. I am far from a snob but if I am going to go to the work to get \"dressed for dinner\" and go out to enjoy the evening, it would make the experience much nicer if all the other patrons would make a little more effort to a least look nice. Both occassions we came here and had dinner were special occassions (birthday and anniversary) and I would summize that most of the other patrons were there for the same. I was the only male there in a button down shirt with collar. Really? T shirts and crappy old jeans with tennis shoes that is business attire for men? Women dressed like service staff for hooters pass for dress code? We got a table at the outside table to enjoy the fountain show during dinner, every time the show started some of the other patrons stood up and went to the fence to watch and take pictures thus blocking everyone elses view. Isnt this something that could have been done out on the street? The one woman was jumping and clapping in a leopard print dress her ass in front of some elderly woman whos view was completely blocked. I dont know it just ruined the entire experience.  I guess overall I blame management for not controlling the situation, if you have patrons behaving in a way that is disruptive, speaking loadly and inappropriate language (saying FUCK every other word) just diminishes the experience for the other patrons who are trying to have a nice meal. I dont mind this if I am at the bar but here??? Overall It is an overpriced applebees.",

Very fancy place, as is just about everything in the Bellagio.    We ordered the butter poached king crab as an app.  It was basically huge chunks of crab floating in a butter sauce that was absolutely delicious.  A little rich, but that's what butter poached crab is supposed to be.  I ordered the surf and turf for my meal and the wife had a great petite filet.  Both were mouth watering dishes and couldn't have been cooked any more perfectly.  The server was excellent and really knew his stuff.  He recommended a really good wine with our meal that was the perfect pairing.    Unfortunately we didn't have room for dessert, but that was ok becasue i could taste my lobster for the rest of the evening.  Like others have said, be prepared for a $300 bill if you like wine with your meal.    This was one of the best meals I have ever had.  Well worth the price!",

The ambience of the indoor dining room is above par, although due to the glamour that is Vegas it pales a little in comparison to some of it's nearby counterparts. The wine list is extensive and fair and their white chocolate martini is one of the best I've ever had. I started with The steak tartare. Of the five times I've had this dish this ranks second (to Tony Bourdain's). The entree was amazing. The truffle mashed potatoes seasoned perfectly, the filet melting in my mouth. They asked my party if we would like to move to the terrace for dessert with water fountains. The chocolate Lave cake was intense and could have used a little more ice cream ala mode. Overall one of the best meals of my life.",

    "text": "My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary and doing dinner and a show. I looked up Open Table reservation availability, and the place seemed to be booked up from 5:45 to 8:30, which overlapped with our show, so I made our reservation for an early dinner at 5:30. I just want to note that throughout dinner, the place was only half full, so I don't know why Open Table said it was booked up. Was it to promote exclusivity? I don't know.  Anyway, I had written in our reservation that a view of the fountains would be appreciated. The first table we were escorted to was against the wall and in a corner with a slight view. It was an OK spot, but considering that pretty much every other table was empty with no one in sight, we requested to be seated more centrally at the window. Our request was met with some trepidation as apparently that particular table was booked. Again, half-full restaurant at 5:30. It still confuses me. Anyway, finally we were moved.  We were greeted by...a sommelier? A waiter? I'm not sure. Leaning towards waiter. He was not particularly friendly. When my husband asked for a recommendation, he was kind of gruff and short. Not the best sell. He gave us the wine list and we ordered two drinks (lemon drop for me,wine for husband). After this, he disappeared, and another waiter (Asian, bald head) took over in his place. Maybe the first waiter was covering for this one? In any case, neither of them introduced themselves. In fact, in the ten minutes between them we looked at our menus and then the second guy showed up. His greeting was, \"ready to order\"? In most places, this would be really no big deal. But if you're a steak house who prides yourself on service and class, introductions should always be made. Not to mention you're in the Bellagio and it's not even particularly busy.  We ordered. Went with truffled mashed potatoes and a tomato salad with burrata cheese, filet mignon for me and rib eye for my husband. We wanted to also try the macaroni and cheese but the waiter was particularly judgmental about this, telling us everything would be more than enough. I'm sorry, but if the waiter is not asked this particular question, they should not comment. This is not a tapas place and maybe we wanted to sample a little of everything? Especially if people note it should be tasted. I was really turned off by this. Personally, I didn't eat all day so that I could indulge in everything that I wanted. He kind of made the decision for me when reciting back what we ordered.  I was incredibly uncomfortable and felt judged for my appetite, so I didn't put up a fight and told my husband to keep quiet as well. I've been to many fine steakhouses and this has NEVER happened before.   The food is what deserved the stars, but the service negated a lot of points. The truffle potatoes are worthy of all the praise. The salad was delicious. My steak was a little red for my liking, even at medium rare, but still yummy. I liked that the steak came with three sauces to sample, and really enjoyed the house speciality sauce. It was a bit of a soy sauce Asian blend. My husband also enjoyed his steak. Interestingly, I noted that a woman to my left got the same steak, but the same waiter offered to...cut it up for her? And to my right, the first waiter who was so gruff with us, was practically kvelling and gossiping with the two older ladies next to us.  Did we look like degenerates? Um, answer is no. I had on a beautiful dress and my husband a beautiful Italian suit. But nevertheless, it seemed like we were targeted as...not big spenders? Not worthy of attentiveness? Who knows.  The only star at that restaurant is the waiter that comes around and refills the water glasses and removes the dishes. He was friendly and chatty and we would have rather tipped him 20% than the guy we did.  At the end of the meal, we were given a free dessert in celebration of our anniversary. It was ok. More chocolate cursive letters than dessert. But hey, it was free. This pleasantness was again negated by having to wait for the check for 40 minutes. Once the waiter had collected our credit card and finally come back, he tried to hand it to me. The name on the credit card is clearly one for a man.  It exemplifies the lack of polish here, as at any other fine restaurant, the credit card would be handed back by name to the person who possesses it (and it's pretty easy to tell who did between the two of us and similarly so if you note the person handing it off to you before you swipe it). Even places like TGI Friday's do this.   Anyway, I would never come back to this style over substance establishment even if the truffle potatoes are at the top of my favorite foods to eat in Vegas. There are better places to dine. Even in my hometown of Philadelphia, Del Frisco's outclasses this place by miles!",

We sat outside (8:30pm in July) and it was a bit too hot. Next time for sure we're sitting inside.  We got the gulf shrimp wrapped in bacon appetizer. It was just okay - wasn't blown away like I thought I would be after reading all the reviews. I think maybe it was a little overcooked since my shrimp wasn't as succulent as I would have thought it to be and the bacon was a tad dry.  Steaks, however, were really good. We got the filet mignon and the porterhouse. Filet was soo soft, melted in your mouth. Porterhouse was equally as amazing. I actually preferred the steak without any of the sauces.   For sides, we got the broccoli and mashed potatoes. Both were good. Nothing too interesting about the broccoli (how exciting can broccoli really be now), but the mashed potatoes were good. I can only imagine how good the truffle mashed potatoes are...next time!   Overall, food and scenery made for a great meal.",

    "text": "This place is worth every penny. We had a fairly expensive dinner (final bill for dinner with tip was $400 for 2 of us) on Friday nite of Memorial Weekend. We made our reservations by walking by the restaurant on Thursday nite, so it was kind of last minute. They had a sign that the dress code was business casual or something like that. We took note of that. We had Friday 5;30pm reservations which we didnt mind since we like to eat early anyway, so it was perfect.  Got seated very fast, right by the window, looking at the fountains. It's odd to see the fountains dancing, but not to hear the music for it though :), just didnt have the same effect.  Our waiter was an older gentleman, with superb service skills. He suggested items, described them really well, same with wine. We were going to order a bottle of good ol' Joseph Phelps, but he suggested something else as well and we tried it. Weren't disappointed! (would like to point out that we are frequent wine tasters so feel to have some ability to distinguish wines).   For appetizer we had shrimp cocktail (huge pieces of shrimp, I could barely eat it all). Main course was lobster (amazing!,and 8oz was just right) and fillet mignon (for hubby, rare, excellent!). The side dishes were great as well, the truffles mashed potato was to die for, as was the crunchy potato! For dessert we shared the chocolate cake (melted chocolate inside and ice cream on the side). Yum.   The only complaint - as we tried to dress as best as possible, I was astonished to see a couple at the next table wearing 'jean's'. And another guy at another table as well. Com'on..Why have the sign up if you aren't going to enforce it? ('Jacket Preferred') As we were leaving, there were people wearing evening gowns for godsakes, why would you wear crappy jeans to a place like this???   I would definitely go back to this place on our next visit!",

    "text": "This should be a 4.5 stars, not quite a five, but pretty darn close. This was the best meal we had our last trip to Vegas. There was 6 or us and we sampled a wide variety from the menu. The wine list was excellent, at Vegas prices, but a very good selection, we enjoyed a couple of bottles that were well presented. I enjoyed a Delmonico steak that was as good as I have had anywhere, melt in your mouth excellent, someone else had the duck which I sampled and it was also done perfectly. Those that had room for dessert were also pleased.  It was an excellent meal, the service was the only reason I did not give a 5 star. Our waiter was a little overwhelmed with all of his tables. The food came out at a perfect temperature, but was a little slow between courses. We also had to wait a while to order. The table he was taking care of before us had 8 people and it seemed that each person needed to discuss their order in detail with multiple questions, most were answered to the previous person at the table, IE: what salad dressings , how much pink does med well have , can I super size my fries..... really, it must have taken 15 minutes for them to order, the waiter was exhausted afterwards and we were starving. .. For a restaurant of this caliber, the wait manager should have stepped in and taken our order, it was obvious we were starving and he was dying at the next table.",

Everything was great and so delicious! The service started a little slow but came together and everyone was friendly and curious about veganism! They even brought out separate vegan bread for us. The vegan pea soup is to die for, so creamy and delicious and elegant, all in one bowl! The risotto was also on point and very flavorful, as were my husbands market vegetables. We were too full for dessert but will have to try their coconut sorbet next time! Thank you Prime Steakhouse for catering to vegans, it is much appreciated! :)",

    "text": "I have eaten here about 8 times and I can safely say this is the best steakhouse that I have been to. I have also eaten at the neighboring Picasso which is great but doesn't come close to Prime(unless you are talking about the art on the wall). While not cheap (and not meant to be), Prime is flawless in terms of food, atmosphere, service, and has a comprehensive wine list and knowledgable sommeliers. While I am not a fan of ordering massive seafood platters where the restaurant gets huge margins on serving you a couple meager crustaceans on a heaping bowl of ice, I must say Prime's shrimp cocktail and Florida stone crab (when in season) are as good as it gets. Their accompanying sauces are also phenomenal. The steaks are nothing short of perfect. I usually go with a small 8 oz. filet which is cooked rare plus and is very dense yet tender and consistent throughout. Their steak sauces are unparalleled. My personal favorite is the soy rice wine sauce... simply amazing. Their sides are solid - I keep it simple with mashed potatoes and asparagus. I have read some reviews of Mastro's in Bevelry Hills which gets 4-5 stars per review. I have eaten @ Mastro's twice and was not excited by my meal either time. In my opinion I would eat @ Prime any day over Mastro's and I could not recommend a finer steakhouse in Vegas.",

    "text": "Couldn't wait to come here for the 50th b-day dinner, but sadly, the whole experience was ruined by the hostess.  We arrived at 9 pm, walked passed the outside patio area and asked to be seated there, since almost all of the tables were open.  This rude hostess told us that they didn't offer patio dining and to try Picasso's or Olives.  What?  I had been seated in the patio many other times.  Dismayed, we left.  Upon returning, another hostess greeted us and asked if we would like inside or outside. Right then, the original hostess popped up from behind the counter and exclaimed \"I already told them we don't offer outside dining!\"  We were dressed very nice and were very pleasant, yet couldn't understand why this woman was so hell-bent on not giving us a patio table. We then took a table inside.  I asked the waiter when they stopped serving outside.  He said that there were plenty of open tables, and he would ask the hostess.  She then came to our table and told us that those table were for reservations only.  It was then 9:20 and 4 tables were open.  Not sure what was said in private, but we were then moved to the patio.  No other parties ever did take those tables until closing. This hostess, with her condescending yet does it with a smile attitude, was by far the rudest person I have come across in a long time.  I will never go back, no matter how good the food is. The rudeness overpowers all of that and ruined what should have been a great dinner celebration.",

    "text": "This is my first Yelp so forgive me if I seem to ramble!  I decided to book a reservation at the Prime Steakhouse after reading the Yelp reviews (thanks guys). However my boyfriend and I left disappointed.   I had made reservations over a MONTH in advance asking for a seat with a view of the Bellagio fountain show. I informed them that this was our first time to the Bellagio and we wanted to make it special. I was told that there were no guarantees but my request will be placed.   We arrived promptly to be seated only to be told that the wait time for a window seat was 1 hour and 1/2 to two hours. Needless to say I was disappointed, especially after making reservations so far in advance.   We were then seated at a larger table and then waited to be serviced. One of the servers handed us a wine menu (this menu is about 35 pages!). I drink wine but I am not a wine connoisseur (and either is my bf) and didn't know what wine would go with what. While I poured over the wine menu, seemingly overwhelmed our main waiter showed up; and boy was he something. He had this total, I-hate-my-job-this-is-my-last-shift type of attitude (you all know what I'm talking about). He didn't introduce himself he just asked if we wanted wine. I felt like we were being pushed to purchase a glass (or two) of wine and I said no, I'll go with another drink for right now. He didn't seem to like that and left the wine menu just in case we changed our minds.   We both ordered the 8oz filet mignon, truffle mashed potatoes and mushrooms, and for an appetizer the bacon wrapped shrimp and that's when the server asked us AGAIN if we were going to get some wine. Look, I know that restaurants make the bulk of their revenue off of alcohol; I understand that, however my boyfriend and I did not appreciate being \"prodded\" to buy wine. What was more shocking to me (especially in such an upscale place) was that he never suggested a wine pairing to go with the meal we were having.  I also noticed that two of the servers were having a argument right near me. I couldn't help overhearing their snickering and was surprised that they would be having it out near customers.   I will say that the filet mignon and truffle mashed potatoes were amazing (if you go you must try the truffle potatoes!!). So I will give them three stars. But the service overshadowed the food. I feel that if we are going to pay around 200 bucks for food then we should be treated accordingly.  Sadly, I'm not sure if we would go there again. If you do decide to go I hope that your experience was better than ours.",

    "text": "My wife and I spent our first anniversary in Vegas last weekend and had dinner at Bellagio's Prime Sunday night. We're both lovers of steak and felt it would be a good way to start the night.  From the moment we arrived at the restaurant we were well taken care of, we got a booth immediately in a quiet room with a few tables that looked out onto the Bellagio fountains. While we couldn't hear the music outside, it was still nice to look out and watch the fountain shows while we enjoyed the atmosphere.  We opted to skip appetizers as we wanted to ensure we would be able to finish all of our respective dinners. I had a bone-in rib-eye while my wife ordered  filet mignon. Both were perfectly cooked, and had some of the best flavors I've had in steaks.  The real treat however was the sauces they brought out. At first I was appalled a steakhouse would suggest a sauce, let alone bring out three, but I skeptically tried each one on some small pieces of my steak, and boy was I happy I did. Both the bearnaise and pepercorn sauces were very tasty and worked well with the steaks adding flavor but not overpowering them. The real winner was the house rice wine sauce however; they could have served the worst steak ever and paired it with this sauce and still gotten me to finish it.   The gratin potatoes we ordered as a side was extremely tasty as well and was more than enough for the two of us. Again, the house sauce was an amazing addition to the already delicious gratin. We got a look at the rest of the sides when a neighboring table ordered one of each and they all looked equally delectable. I look forward to trying the ginger sweet potatoes and the truffle mashed potatoes on future visits.  One thing to be careful of though is if you ask for water and only want tap water, be sure to make this clear to your waiter. We asked for water to go with our drinks and got an $8 bottle of Fiji water.",

    "text": "As Borat would say, \"Veddy Niceee.\" Was it the best steak I've ever had? No. But, it was very good.  We went there on a relatively-slow Sunday night. We didn't make reservations because honestly, we didn't think we'd need any. We got there at 8:30 and asked for a table for three. Even though the dining room looked busy, it wasn't completely full. They asked if we had a reservation, we said no, and they put one in for us for 9:00 and told us to come back at 9:00. So, we went and gambled, then came back and our table was ready right when we got there. I appreciate promptness.  The dining room is a tad on the small side, but dark and cozy. The chairs are nice and comfortable, and the tables are large. I felt underdressed in a T-shirt and jeans. Though they don't \"enforce\" a dress code, they have a sign that says they recommend a jacket for men. Not sure what the dress code for women is, but I'm pretty sure my T-shirt and jeans didn't quite make the cut.  Unfortunately, we didn't get a table by the window. We could still see the water show from our table, but we couldn't hear the music. I'm sure if we had a reservation well in advance, we probably could have requested a window table, but oh well. But yeah, if you make reservations, ask for a window table! They're really nice and the water show comes on every 10 minutes or so. It's a nice little distraction during dinner, y'know?  Anyway, our waiter was the bomb. Generally at these uppity-steakhouse places, the waiters are a tad pompous. But, ours was awesome. He cracked jokes with us, told us what the specials were, and answered any questions we had about the menu. He also made great wine recommendations as well. He was great!  We each got a steak as well as a few sides (a T-bone for my friend, filet for my bf, and some kind of regular steak for me). Our food came out in about 20 minutes. My steak was very good -- moist, juicy, and flavorful. My only small complaint is that it was a *tad* overcooked. I asked for medium-rare, and it came out a little more on the medium side. All of their steaks are accompanied by several homemade sauces. My favorite one was their house sauce, which was some soy-based sauce. It was so yummy! For sides, we got the creamed spinach, asparagus, and sauteed mushrooms. The sides were an OK size. All three of us could split them, but a bigger helping would have been great. The asparagus was not good at all. They were overcooked and more soggy than crunchy. I was disappointed because that's one of my favorite veggies. The creamed spinach was good, but could have used some garlic or other flavoring. The mushrooms were by far the best side dish. They were flavorful and so delicious! If I had known that in advance, I would have gotten two orders of the mushrooms and passed on the asparagus.   We passed on dessert, since we were all pretty much full. When the bill came, it was a tad over $300. Not bad for the three of us. All in all, it was a positive experience. I probably wouldn't go there again, seeing as how I don't go to Vegas much and would like to try a different steakhouse next time. But, I definitely liked it and would recommend it to a friend.",

    "text": "When you pay PRIME prices you expect PRIME service and PRIME food. This was at least our fifth visit to PRIME and very likely our last.  We have celebrated birthdays and anniversaries at PRIME and on December 23, 2010 were looking for a quiet getaway and a splurge on dinner with perfect service as we had enjoyed in the past. We arrived at our reservation time. Our prior request for a table by the window was not honored but it was a nice table and we were happy when we were seated. In all past visits I would have given PRIME a five star rating. We ordered drinks and appetizers. We soon noticed that the highly attentive, though not imposing service we have come to love and expect at PRIME was not present. Drinks took over 10 minutes and bread took 20. The shrimp cocktail was amazing as usual, keeping in mind that 4 shrimp for $20 ought to be amazing.   We each ordered the Baby Iceberg Lettuce with Crispy Bacon & Maytag Bleu Cheese Dressing. This was served about 30 minutes into our visit. (By then my husband was ready for another drink and started trying to catch someone's eye to request one. Our waiter was occupied with the table of 5 seated next to us. Finally my husband asked someone else for another drink. It took at least 15-20 more minutes for the drink to arrive and the person who brought it was not our waiter and not until after we had complained to the manager.) For $18 each you might expect some interesting salad presentation. I enjoyed eating the salad but not the fact that I had to cut the lettuce myself. It looked like they had just cut a center slice of the baby lettuce head and plopped it on a plate. My husband thought the salad was too rich as there were blue cheese chunks and heavy blue cheese dressing along with very thick bacon.   For the main course we each ordered the small filet mignon $44 for 8oz. These don't come with any side dishes so we also ordered sides of potatoes and mushrooms to share. We had been there about an hour by now and my drink was empty, our waters were empty and our waiter was now taking an order at a third table. I asked a staff member passing by if I could please speak to a manager. The General Manager came right to our table. I told her we were sad that the service was so poor and that our waiter seemed not to have time for us. My husband still did not have the second drink. The Manager was extremely polite and said she was very sorry and that she would take care of things. This did get things going -- though we did not like to have to complain to get decent service. My husband's second drink came a minute after she walked away. Then the filet were served but again not by our waiter. I suspect they had been sitting \"up\" for a while. The filet were cold to the touch but each had two small charred green chili peppers sizzling next to them. The charred pepper smell was overpowering to the point that it hit the sinus right as they lifted off the silver cover.  Within that same minute sides were delivered. We got the mushrooms but instead of potatoes, we got creamed spinach.   That was it. The dinner we had been looking forward to for months was ruined. Since neither of us like hot peppers or spinach, we decided to leave. I asked for the manager again and told her that we needed to leave as the wrong side and hot peppers along with the poor service had ruined our dinner. I asked her to please charge what we had eaten up to that point to our room, but she declined to do so. She was very empathetic and offered to reseat us and start over or send whatever we wanted back to our room. This was a kind offer but we were just not up for either as our experience was ruined. By then it was around 9pm and we were just tired of trying to beg for service in what is supposed to be a four star place.   After many good dinners and fond memories of the exceptionally fine service, superior food and decor as well as the beautiful view of the fountains, I don't think we will go back. This awful experience has ruined it for us. Given that this hotel opened in 1998, we both wondered whether the waiters we had so very much enjoyed in prior visits had moved on to newer places or were just not working.",

It is absolutely incredible! Our Waiter was an older gentleman and was very knowledgeable about everything on the menu. We didn't get any wine, but had a couple of cocktails (cosmos) that were literally the best I've ever had (think of that perfect shaved layer of ice on top).  Went here for Thanksgiving dinner - my brother had the turkey dinner complete with stuffing and sweet mashed potatoes. I didn't try his because mine was so good I didn't want to waste any bite of fullness on someone else's food. The older heavier watier was looking more and more attractive as I ate my beef. I actually thought as I was eating that if someone cooked for me like this on a regular basis I would do anything for them including marrying them! HOLY GOD this is GOOD FOOD!!!!!!!!!   I had the beef from Australia - the fillet. And the sauces that went with it were out of this world! (Peppercorn, and 2 others that were creamy).  For the appetizer, we had the chilled seafood platter - lobster, king crab claw, mussels, clams, oysters, shrimp, lump crab meat - all ready to eat! No peeling or cracking involved! It was also amazing! The total bill for the 2 of us was 300. Not bad at all for what we got. I highly recommend this place.",

None of our wines were on the menu. He made recommendations as to what to drink first. Cool! So rest of dinner was fine, food was great. Still picked up on this weird snootiness from Bob the whole time. We get our check, pay, sign. As were sitting there in the middle of our conversion, he flat out interrupts us, sticks his arm in front of our faces to take the signed check before we even left. Absolutely unprofessional and rude. You do not cut me off mid sentence and take the check from our table before we leave. This is not Denny's. I really wish I would've known that he was going to pull such tacky behavior before I tipped him. Will only patronize Mastros from now on. Prime pales in comparison.",

The atmosphere can accommodate large groups like ours or the intimate date night - we will certainly be back!",

    "text": "The Prime Steakhouse is an elegant restaurant tucked away within the confines of the Bellagio Hotel. Unlike the other steakhouses located on the strip, the Prime is one of those classy restaurant that caters to the sophisticated diner with high expectations in service and the quality of the food. Reservations are strongly recommended and an evening in this restaurant will set you back a minimum of $250 for two people.   Overview: I have visited at this restaurant a total of 3 times in the past several months and I was never once disappointed. The service is outstanding and they will generally try to work with the customer to provide the best possible dining experience. One of the Prime's main selling point is that they feature dry aged beef that has been aged for over 30 days for the best possible flavor. They also have a varied selection of wines to compliment your dinner.   PROS: An enjoyable and sophisticated atmosphere, excellent staff, and quality cuts of beef.   CONS: The restaurant has a dress code posted requiring dinner jackets for men. However, that dress code is loosely enforced. I have seen some guests come in with a dress shirt and jeans.   Restaurant Class: Lower-Upper   Food: (4 out of 5 stars) The steaks are well prepared and cooked to order. And the dry aged ribeye do not disappoint. Any steak you order in this restaurant will be a quality cut of beef. The side dishes were also surprisingly good. They are also large enough to be shared. The only negative thing I noticed about the steaks was that it was a bit on the salty side for my palliate. But that can be easily remedied by ordering your steak with less salt or unsalted.   Atmosphere: (4 out of 5 stars) If you are celebrating a special occasion or just want to have a romantic dinner, this restaurant is definitely for you. The atmosphere is relaxing yet vibrant enough to keep your attention; and the mood is sophisticated, yet subtle enough to have a little fun. Lastly, you can never go wrong with a window seat overlooking the Bellagio fountains.   Cleanliness: (4.5 out of 5 stars) The entire dining room is kept virtually spotless and comfortable. The tables are cleaned frequently with fresh linens and table cloths.   Service: (4 out of 5 stars) The staffs are all absolute professionals. They know their jobs and they know what the customer expects out of them. In fact, they are so detailed oriented that they will give the gentlemen wearing a dark suit a black linen instead of a white one.   Restroom Facilities: (3.5 out of 5 stars) Despite this restaurant's location, it does have it's own facilities. And like the dinning room, the restrooms are kept relatively clean and well stocked. Additionally, the men's room also comes with complimentary amenities like lotion or hair cell.",

Was given the wine list and menu and our overbearing waiter wanted to get my wine order even before i was able to look at the menu or hear if they had any specials.  I asked if there were any wines on special as the wines on the list are over-pricey.  He said no and that i should consider wines by the glass or half bottles.  The 2012 Husic Estate Cabernet Sauvignon was listed at $65 per glass. Now, i don't know how much wine is in the glass, i suspect NOT MUCH, but since the bottle retails for less than $100 and the restaurant likely got the bottle for around $60, i'd say that was serious gouging.  Suffice it to say that the wait staff was so haughty, snooty, overbearing and money-grubbing, that we opted to JUST LEAVE and NOT get any of the overpriced items on the menus.  We went to Olives, also at Bellagio, and were taken care of by a wonderful Chris instead.",

    "text": "I was the maid-of-honor for a dear friend of mine so of course I planned a trip to Vegas for her bachelorette party! My job was to secure the hotel and pick which buffets we were to eat at (we purchases the $45 for 24 hours of buffets pass) and my sister's job was to pick one nice spot for dinner. That was how we ended up at Prime Steakhouse in Bellagio.  The food was amazing. This was what we ordered:  - Prime onion soup with gruyere cheese = absolutely divine. What's not to like about anything gruyere. - Filet Mignon with shishito peppers. I had it medium rare because that's how I like mine to be done = melted in my mouth. Lightly seasoned but was very tasty and so tender. - Peppercorn New York steak (this was what the bride ordered). Done medium rare. I had a taste and it was so good. Nice and meaty and lots of flavor. - Caramelized scallops = so good! It has a slight sweet kick but also very savory. The scallops filled you up because they were huge.   - Some of the sides we ordered were the summer corn, creamed spinach and truffle mashed potatoes and mac and cheese. All were superb! Well-made and delicious!  We made reservations and got there right on the dot. We were immediately greeted and seated right away. Our server and all the workers were very attentive throughout the whole dinner, refilling our water glass, making sure our cocktails tasted right, brushing the bread crumbs off our table, etc. Since it was a bachelorette party dinner, there was also a photographer that was there and took pictures of our party. She had it all printed on glossy paper and framed for us by the end of dinner and asked if we wanted to purchase any. We bought two for the bride as a memorable gift.  The restaurant was very clean and the set-up was done well. I couldn't get over how beautiful the restroom was! I could literally live in there! lol.  Prime Steakhouse did me well! I was very satisfied by the quality of the food and staff.   There are so many good places to eat in Vegas and I'm on a mission to try them all so I probably won't be back to Prime anytime soon. But I highly recommend it! Try it out, pure Vegas experience alright!",

Unfortunately, it took three tries to get my bone-in filet right. I asked for medium and got medium well-well. I sent it back and got my cut steak cooked longer until fully well. They obviously weren't listening to what I said. They re-did it again and got it right.  My fiance's peppercorn NY Strip was overcooked on the first try (ordered med. rare and received med. plus), as well.  It was sent back and replaced with a rare to medium rare steak (not perfect but acceptable).  Truffle mashed and crab mashed were great!  Steak had good flavor but I'm not sure if it was $70 quality, though. I've definitely had better steaks for half the price.  The ambiance and front row patio seating for the fountains made up for alot.  Service was below par for the level that you expect in a restaurant of this caliber.  Our waiter \"forgot\" about us several times.  He basically disappered from our table, only to be seen serving couples that arrived after us.  Like I mentioned before, the service was sub-par.  Great location with romantic views of the fountains but that can only take a restaurant so far.  The food and service must be kept at the same level.  The photographer that comes around and takes pictures, which will be available for purchase, did a great job.  She took some great shots and provided a great memory of a special dinner / trip.  The pictures were resonably priced, as well.  Next time, we'll try one of the many other high-end steakhouses in Vegas.",

They were more concerned with the larger tables, which of course they get an automatic gratuity.   They stopped by the smaller tables just twice.  A buser filled our waters repeatedly but trying to get any other drinks was pretty much well pointless.  The atmosphere is beautiful and romantic but most tables do not have a view of the fountains which is a shame. They also seem to rush out the smaller tables as well.  We were done under an hour.  Not much time to sit and enjoy, seemed more of eat and get out.  It could have been our waitstaff but I just was not impressed.",

When our guest asked if he could have a pretzel role put in his to go bag, he said \"we don't have anymore, unless you want me to go look thru the trash.\" He was rude and offensive.

I'm not only honored but extremely happy that as of yet this steak was the best steak that I have ever had so far. As chef Jean-Georges mentioned on a commercial for the steakhouse in my Bellagio suite, every decent Chef can cook a steak, but what complements it are it's sauces or condiments. Many will agree with this, and few will disagree. But those who know where to get great cuts of meat, aged to perfection, know that salt-and-pepper and a good grill will always equal to a good and some even say a great steak. But what put this steak over the top, was the chef's recommendation to try his house sauce. I am not talking about some sort of steak sauce/barbecue sauce. I am talking about his signature steak sauce or juice as some may describe. Along with trying this steak with the other three common sauces normally used on steaks, his shined through with brilliance. Accompanied with a very well matched and seasoned subtle mashed Yukon Gold potatoes and a Caesar salad that I will never forget. This made for, if not the best but, one of the best meals I have ever had in my lifetime so far.",

Appetizers were excellent - tuna ribbons was delicious, loved the ginger/chili/soy/whatever marinade, french onion soup among the best I've had with a subtle flavor and good blend of cheese, crab salad was pretty good.  Got the dry aged bone in rib steak and the soy garlic strip steak, both cooked medium. Quality of the meat was excellent, and temperature was perfect. Soy garlic strip was a little salty (but within expectations for an Asian marinade). Rib steak was so salty I couldn't eat it. Left over more than half. First time that has ever happened to me in a steak place.   Split the chocolate cake dessert which was excellent.  This may have just been a fluke (judging by other positive reviews), but I won't go back. For the price (300+ for two people), the meal should be perfect.",

The steak and service  is on par with other high end steakhouses I've been to, but what's really special about this place is the ambiance. The setting is very intimate and you have a view of the fountain/Bellagio watershow from the restaurant. Great spot for a special occasion.  As for the food, the dungeness crab salad tastes like a very expensive california roll sans the rice--light, refreshing and tasty, but not sure if it's worth the price. The dry aged bone in rib eye was tender, beefy and flavorful, but i'd definitely suggest you split it with your dining companion(s) because it is way too much meat for one person. The chilean sea bass (which was what I ordered) was a smidgen overcooked and therefore a tad dry, but the portion was also huge at 8oz; usually restaurants give you a small filet of fish, but the portion here was double the size. This place is definitely not for those on a diet as the food is quite rich and heavy.",

My husband wanted to surprise me and we even waited until a 9pm reservation in much anticipation of the high quality food we were expecting for the very high priced food. We had to wait 20 more minutes after our reservation time so you know we were starving !  We ordered a delicious glass of champagne while waiting for the $195 caviar. When it came I had goosebumps and my mouth was watering , I took me first bite to find that it was borderline spoiled. It has a very very fishy taste with a stagnant water flavor. I didn't want to say anything to my Husband and embarrass him so I have him a bite. He almost spit it out. The manager Anna came to the table and said \" hi I'm the manager , what's going on over here at this table ? We were like hmmm should we even bother explaining .. we did and her reply was well it's surely not spoiled and I'm sorry you don't like it. We decided to focus on the gorgeous ambiance and looked forward to our salads and porterhouse steak $130, while we drank our $300 bottle of wine. The salad arrived and I went through the first 3 bites trying to decide why my salad tasted like sour vomit. I'm sorry for that word but that's really what it tasted like. Of course I did order the wedge with blue cheese (which I order in every steakhouse ) I came to the conclusion it was spoiled blue cheese. Again I didn't want to complain to my husband so I gave him a bite. He immediately said Igggg that tastes terrible ! Then he got upset and told the very nice waiter the issue. Again the manager came and her only response was it's NOT spoiled. We said. Ok just take it away please. Then the porterhouse arrived. The very nice server sliced it for us and presented it. I was more then starved at this point. I took my first bite of the filet cut. It was good. I took my second bite , good. I took a bite of the strip side and it was nothing more than chewey and tasteless.  I tried 3 more bites. Once again I didn't want to complain. At this point I felt so bad for my Husband who was going to spend over $700 for this. So I have him a bite. He spit it out. We never said anything about this as there was no use. They did bring us a delicious dessert tray for the bad caviar experience and didn't charge for the rotten salad.  In the end , very romantic place. Great service. Poor quality food and terrible management. We won't be back.",

    "text": "Prime; one of the top four steak houses in Vegas.  A pantheon of beef.  Where Bacchus reigns over a 500+ selection of to die for wines.  Where the \"brown\" libations are over the top.  At Prime, the menu is seasonally updated.  The fall of 2012 features an outstanding, air flown colossal stone crab appetizer (three huge claws the size of your hand with a pile of knuckle and leg meat).  Heaven and at $75, and worth every penny.  Sweet.  Perfect.  The steak tartar on a platter of Carpaccio is delicious but slightly unbalanced with over the top Asian spice heat.  Finally, the bacon wrapped shrimp.  Wow.  The fat of the bacon permeates the rich, sweet flesh of the barely cooked through shrimp.  Outstanding.  Beef mains are to die for.  Japanese A5 Kobe cuts of beef (4oz minimum $35 per ounce).  Sublime if you don't over indulge.  A four to six ounce portion is enough for anyone.  Offered in a strip, rib, or fillet cut.  The rib is the most flavorful.  DO NOT ORDER THIS IF YOU WANT YOUR BEEF COOKED BEYOND RARE.  You are wasting your money as the fat will melt during cooking and the beef taste like any other piece of beef.  The 30 day dry aged, bone fillet is excellent.  Huge umame finish without tasting edgy.  Soft and tender.  The veal chop is equally good.  Sweet, deep beef flavor from free ranged calves.  Double cut, perfectly seared and moist throughout.    All mains come with sauces and sides.  They match and are very flavorful but do not pass on ordering some veg and off the menu potato dauphinois to share.  Sides are perfectly cooked.  Rich and refreshing.  Killer wine list with great depth of cult wines.  Great values to be found at higher price points (best priced Screaming Eagle in Vegas). Outstanding cognac selection.  Service is excellent.  Friendly and extremely efficient.  Note:  Unlike most Vegas restaurants, for reservations, you MUST be a high status member of Mlife to book the best tables and times on short notice.  If you use OpenTable, make your reservation at least 60 days in advance  Outdoor and window tables where you can view the incredible fountain show at the Bellagio are very difficult to secure.  A truly memorable experience in Vegas not afforded to everyone.  Do whatever it takes to try it.    A dozen plus visits since my initial review.  Extremely consistent.  Highly Recommended.",

The service, the ambiance and the food were all spot-on. I would highly recommend it dry aged bone-in ribeye. It was an amazing steak and priced fairly.    I wish I would remember the waiter's name.

Truffled mashed potato is highly recommended. It just melts in your mouth. Everywhere I go, if I see a beef tartare or beef carpaccio on the menu I always get it. With that being said, Prime's was the best I've had so far. The dining experience is not just about the food but also the service. The server was on-point. He was not too much or too little.",

They sat us outside where we had a perfect view of he fountain going off. It was completely romantic and made for an unforgettable night.  My husband and I each got a Caesar salad, shared an aged rib-eye, shared a 6 oz lobster tail and got the Mac n cheese as our side. We ordered the Mac and salad thinking that the portions would be small but that wasn't the case at all. The salad was huge and we had so much food that we couldn't finish the Mac. I'll be back for sure. Loved it.",

Service was great but wasn't nearly as excellent as Jean Georges Fine Dining Restaurants.  **The Foie Gras was perfectly prepared, everyone's steak was perfection, the Dover sole was a delight and everyone's dessert were delicious**  The food was delicious for a Steak House, however it was definitely missing those wonderful elegant touches from Jean Georges.  We brought our own wine since they do not carry Screaming Eagle. They were completely fine with us bringing our own wine!!  Overall experience- it's a great steak house but I wouldn't even know it's a Jean Georges Restaurant. Basically with his name attached,  it's a way to bring more people into this establishment. Most of these lower end celebrity restaurants are a total miss but this place still had great food!!",

We arrived at 8:28 for an 8:30 reservation and were told \"you're a few minutes early, they're working on your table, go inside and make yourselves comfortable.\" We went to the bar and had a phenomenal Old Fashioned that the very courteous bartender made for us. Then about 30 minutes went by, and many patrons had been seated while we were still waiting. The bartender, looking out for us, went to the hostess stand to ask about our status. When he came back, he told us that they gave him no information. At that point, we were done. As we left, we let the hostess know that we were going elsewhere. Here's the thing...and we aren't like this at all, but...it was my birthday dinner and we are guests of the Bellagio and staying in a premium suite. Completely unacceptable to have this level of service and unapologetic response when we express concern. Especially when we're suite guests in your hotel. We were looking forward to dropping $400 or so on your expensive dinner, however, we don't tolerate poor service in Vegas. There are too many other excellent choices.",

The dining room is stunning, intimate, and inviting and has gorgeous views of the Bellagio fountains. The service was friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. We completely splurged, and went from classic caviar service to appetizers, entrees, and deserts. The steaks were cooked perfectly, dry aged and juicy, with a nice selection of sauces... though they didn't need them. I was told the lobster was as succulent as could be, but I am allergic and could not try it for myself. The shrimp cocktail, however, was excellent so I believe the comments on the lobster. The side dishes - the element that ultimately defines the overall success of a steakhouse for me - were perfect. The onion rings were battered, seasoned, and crisped to perfection. The mac & cheese was ooey gooey. The creamed spinach was fresh and not too creamy. The warm chocolate cake was heavenly.  This is easily one of the best steakhouses in Vegas, and the fountain view might just push it to the top if that's your sort of thing.",

Like every where in Vegas, the place is pricey, but the quality of food is also there.  Our party was seated promptly and we had 2 tables. The service was amazing and one of the steaks was overcooked and our waiter took it back and made another without any issues. The view is nice because you can see the fountain from our table which went on every 15-30 mins or so.   I had the Bone-In Rib Eye medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. It wasn't too rare and most importantly, it wasn't overcooked. The steak had just the perfect amount of fat in it and the quality of the steak was good too. I would definitely pay the price for this steak again!",

    "text": "Disappointing...  My wife and I were very excited to dine here, which made our experience that much more disappointing...  Reservation - arrived promptly at 7:00, were told we would have to wait.  Waiting is not generally a problem, but it is when the restaurant is not full and tables of two that showed up after us were sat.  Also, another couple (who arrived after us) were led to their table only to return a minute later because they did not like the location.  The hostess then asked if they would like to be seated in another section because there were \"plenty\" of tables available...meanwhile it is 7:30 and we are still waiting.  Bread - stale...literally difficult to swallow   Appetizers - options were limited as I am not a seafood/shellfish guy, but we were not planning on ordering one anyway  Steak - this is where it gets really disappointing...To start, the presentation was awful.  Prime makes a show about wheeling their silver covered plates throughout the restaurant, but I did not know our steak had arrived until it was unceremoniously delivered over my shoulder onto the table.  The steaks (Bone-in Ribeye, their most well liked steak according to our server) were visibly unappealing.  To start, the cut was very thin, an inch at most.  I am not sure what they were trying to do with the butter when cooking the steaks, but they did not finish - it was a gelatinous mess.  I have never seen something like this, even I can properly melt butter when grilling steaks at home.  I wish I had taken a picture because of how terrible it looked.  Because I order my steaks Black & Blue it is difficult to comment on the temperature, but my wife's was not hot, or even warm.  In all fairness, the flavor was decent.  Sides - I am not big on sides, I tend to only need the steak, but my wife loves mashed potatoes.  We ordered a side of the Yukon mashed.  I think they served it in a bowl the size of a coffee cup.  For $18.  I understand this is an expensive restaurant and you are paying for ambiance, location, etc. - but $18 for a coffee cup of Potato Buds is a tad excessive.  We both agreed these \"potatoes\" either came powdered from a box/bag/sack, or their potato masher competes in strong man competitions - you could almost drink them, with nary a lump to be found. They were also lacking in flavor, and again, not even warm.  Desert - Although we agreed we would be throwing good money after bad my wife ordered the molten chocolate cake.  Another disappointment...decent flavor, but the cake was extremely dry.  Presentation was lacking and it was pretty evident it also came from a box or plastic tray.  Service - The staff were average, not exceptional, and we did not feel like valued guests.  Overall - We expected so much more from this dinner.  We have been to many high end steakhouses across the country, and this experience was one of the least enjoyable.  I don't post often, but felt I had too on this one...",

My husband says his steak was the BEST steak he's ever had in his life. Now that's a bold statement since we've eaten at some great steakhouses.  The lobster I had melted, as in melted in my mouth. The butter that it came with was perfect. I know its just melted butter but it was the best pair with the lobster.

The bartender seemed like he was having a bad night or maybe he was just a jerk, thank goodness we only waited a few minutes until our hostess advised us that our table was ready. Besides the wonderful steaks that were a bit charred to perfection and juicy pink on the inside, we really enjoyed the famous truffled mashed potatoes. We ordered a salad with enoki mushrooms to start off with and it was large enough to share. They have an extensive wine menu and the dim lighting gives the restaurant more of a romantic feel. I enjoyed my meal very much but may stick with Craftsteak and Cut in the future since they have much better service.",

I however, was on a business dinner that turned not too friendly, but that did not detract from the food. I had the smaller fillet, Medium Rare, some dauphinoise potatoes that were very good and the usual wine accompaniment. Service was outstanding. Nobody intruded when I was taking to task a supplier, and when things lightened up they came around doing what wait staff do.   Atmosphere outstanding. The steaks were very Prime and it was a great eating experience. Forgot to ask if they had a blender. Maybe next time!

    "text": "Average, average, average.  Food - The steak carpaccio was delicious. This was definitely the highlight of the meal. In terms of entrees the porterhouse was good but not mindblowing. Same goes for the sauces. The sauce made from grapes was good but the others were pretty standard. At the suggestion of the waiter we ordered the crispy potatoes as a side. They were literally exactly the same as TGIFridays potato skins, but maybe a little greasier.    Service - This was mixed. Our waiter was very nice but the host/busboy/captain (?) kind of huddled and made my friends and I a little uncomfortable.  Atmosphere - The person selling photographs is tacky. The view is top notch but the other decor feels a little tired. This also definitely isn't a young or happening crowd (which I probably should have figured).  It's vegas, go somewhere better.",

The table was awesome! - They sat us right by the side of the Bellagio lake so we can watch the water show.  2.) Service was impeccable!  3.) Food was simply amazing! - I had the rib eye and my girlfriend had the fillet mignon with the fois gras. They were awesome! I would also recommend the green peas with mint - delicious!  4.) The lava cake is irresistible!   My only disappointment was that I ate too much for brunch at the Bellagio Buffet and I didn't save enough room to try the appetizer! I recommend Prime to anyone who loves steaks. I will definitely pay them another visit when I return to Vegas!",

Prime is always top-notch, and our most recent trip for my husband's 40th birthday was no exception.  They went to great lengths to accomodate my husband's Celiac disease, even going so far as to prepare and bake gluten-free bread for the table as well as gluten free sauces and desserts.  We sat out on the patio and enjoyed the fountains immensely from that vantage. The steaks were fantastic - the sides to die for .... everything was absolutely top-notch.  Can't wait to visit again.",

It was crowed around the bar but the hostess was quick pleasant and sat us immediately...with a great view of the fountains out the window.  The waiters were great.  Attentive and never rushed you, even with people waiting.  I started with Ribbons of Tuna - so amazing.  The sauce was excellent and made the dish.  I also managed to \"test out\" my friend's Steamed Shrimp Salad.  Another hit.  So fresh were the seafood portions of these dishes.  My entree was a dry aged bone-in rib eye done medium rare.  Cooked perfectly and it was delicious.  I enjoyed much more than when I went to CarneVino.  We got sides of Yukon Gold Mashed Potatos and Gnocci - both again...excellent.  No room for dessert but overall a great triumph!",

The ambiance was very comfortable and we liked the semi private rooms with curtains separating them.    We had four tables in our area.  We were far from the fountain, and I imagine sitting on the patio or near the fountain windows would be an awesome experience!   Our waiter was good, attentive, not overly friendly but helpful.  I had the tuna and it was cooked perfectly, however the puffed rice crust on the tuna was odd and I didn't enjoy that combination.  The Caesar salad was a unique flavor, hot and spicy.  Others in our group enjoyed the fillet and the rib eye which they reported were cooked correctly and large portions, which was nice given the price of over $80 for each, really?  The sides were good, smallish, and expensive at $12-14 each.    It was a nice meal, nice location, but $$$$$",

We had the gruyere fritters (WTF!!), parmesan crusted chicken (which was gigantic, btw), and a filet and by the end of the meal, if I'd had pants on, they would have burst.  Literally.  Luckily I had on a dress, so I was safe.  They brought out a chocolate lava cake and vanilla ice cream w/ a candle on it for my birthday (YAY ME!), and which I devoured in about 30 seconds flat.  I have nothing bad to say about this place.   Except for maybe enforce your dress code.  Who let the douchebag w/ a tee shirt and ratty jeans in?",

No dessert as dessert menu was underwhelming.  I had only a glass of wine, but flipped through a very extensive wine list.  I found the waiter a little over the top and at times I became annoyed.

I checked in with the hostess and was told it'll be a moment while they set up our table.  Ten minutes later she tells me that there are no tables available overlooking the fountains.  I said it fine, just seat us anywhere.  Finally, thirty minutes later we were finally seated at some cramped up table next to the restrooms.  How lovely.   Service was slow.  Food was whatever.  My brother ordered the special surf and turf.  Lobster was way rubbery and dry.  His steak was alright.  I ordered the special kobe beef plate.  It had 3 oz of each rib eye, filet mignon, and boneless sirloin.  A total of 9 oz of kobe for $240.  It was the most expensive plate I ever ordered.  And sadly I wasn't really that impressed by the food.  I had ordered them medium and the filet was beyond well done.  Sigh.  I had nothing to say about our sides and starters.  The wine we ordered was the only good thing about the meal.  I usually am a big fan of dessert but I was so thrown off by the food that I had to skip dessert.    For our party of four, our bill ran out to a little over $600.  Thank God it was comped by the hotel (thanks to my mom's love of the slot machines), otherwise I would have had to make a run for it. I suggest dining at Michael Mina or Picasso when at the Bellagio.  Prime Steakhouse is for old folks with limited taste and too much time and too much money on their hands.  I feel a little bad saying that, especially since it seems like so many other people on Yelp enjoyed this place.",

The best I could compare it to was a recent dinner at Ruth's Chris which was under $200 and we enjoyed much more. However, this is not Ruth's. It's nicer in most ways.  The environment is very nice. If you get a window table you get awesome views of the Bellagio water show. Our table was ready without a wait which was nice.  Service is good but we felt rushed and had to slow things down a couple times. For that much money I don't want to feel rushed.  So, again we don't normally eat fancy. We are Chili's and Chipotle type people so take that in to account. To us this meal simply wasn't worth the cost. I would rather eat 50 meals at Chipotle, LOL!  Seriously though, if you want a very nice atmosphere, good service, and good food this is a good spot.  If you want to impress your date bring her here!  I just don't think it's worth the cost to ME. Oh ya, I had the tomato salad and it was especially good. Unique, large and VERY good. It stuck out more than anything else we had. Otherwise just good.",

(no pun intended : ),  The patio was closed due to the chill in the air. So,  we were seated right next to a window where the water was no less than 5' away.  From the very second we stepped into the Prime up to paying the check...it was an absolutely stunning evening.  The service was impeccable, classy and just what I was taught how it should be.  I ordered the beet salad and it was so good.  There were roasted beets on top of yogurt, no doubt.  LOVED the combination and never had thought of putting those 2 foods together.  My husband ordered the french onion soup which he said was the best he's ever had!  We both ordered the 16 oz. rib eye, med. rare!  The steaks were served still hot and perfectly cooked to our liking.  They put 3 different sauces on the table but, the steak was so good that a sauce just wouldn't do it justice.  Not a sauce person much anyway.  We had a side of the mushrooms and chickpea fries.  Excellent!  And all the time we were delicately devouring our dinner, the fountains entertained us over and over.    This is a restaurant that will be revisited over and over by us.  It's pricey and I guess one has to pay for the view, as well.  But, such a lovely indulgence!",

For sides, we had the mashed potato and asparagus. We were celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary and we were surprised with a special dessert.  It was certainly a lovely evening and a delicious meal, but I wouldn't go back for dinner, perhaps a drink at the bar -- there are Vegas steak houses that are just as good (food and decor) and a much better value.

    "text": "***This review is for 10/16/17  Oh my what an experience! First off, this restaurant is in a prime (pun intended) location just over looking the Bellagio fountains. We were able to watch the shows during our entire evening, which was lovely. You also have the option to sit out on the patio. The interior of Prime exudes luxury, with long, tapestry like curtains hanging from the ceiling everywhere in a rich colors and fabrics.   The service was wonderful from the moment we walked in! I love having a good steak dinner to celebrate (this time for my birthday) and this place did not disappoint. They had a lovely selection of bread prior to our soup and salads arriving (try the French Onion it was perfect). My husband also enjoyed their house Old Fashioned and said it was on point. I enjoyed the filet for dinner while my husband had a NY strip. Both were cooked perfectly. But what put them over the top was a house ginger sauce. It was to die for. We also enjoyed the mashed potatoes with truffle oil (was eh) along with the Brussels sprouts with pear, and that was a lovely side!   Lastly, we enjoyed the chocolate cake for dessert, plus cappuccinos. It was perfect. Highly recommend this place for a steak and ambiance that wows!",

It's a very classy atmosphere it is a bit pricey but your in Vegas, at Belagio, sitting in a patio with the beautiful fountains what else you expect.",

Since it was a special occasion we ask to be seated with a view of the fountains and they did (nice touch).  Service was excellent and the food and presentation excellent!  Probably one of the best ribeye steaks I have had.  In the middle of the meal we noticed that bread had not been served.  When we mentioned something it was brought out immediately.  We had three different deserts to share all excellent!  When our bill came our server said he comped the side dishes (4 in total) and the deserts because bread was not served.  Very classy.....I would highly recommend.  It's pricy but worth the experience.  One side note, there is a dress code (poste on their website).  My only issue they should enforce the code.  Several people were not dressed appropriately.",

We were sat next to the entrance of the kitchen. It was like being next to the opening of a tunnel lol These people were on a high speed mission to get in and out with lightning speed of a Waffle House. We decided to take dessert back to the room to allow some peace to eat.   SEARED HUDSON VALLEY FOIE GRAS* Was really fatty this resulted in a mushy feel Great flavor but texture was lacking   BUTTERNUT SQUASH SOUP Biggest thank for no mushrooms and was amazing.

    "text": "My fiance and I have decided to review restaurants based on five criteria: Food, Alcohol, Cleanliness & Ambiance, Service and Value/Price.  This was our first meal after I proposed so everything might be a little on the favorable side keep that in mind as you read on.   FOOD  We started with a half dozen oysters. This is the first time I mention oysters in a review but we love them. These oysters were from Nova Scotia and they were fantastic. They were smaller which we prefer and on the sweet side which we also prefer.  We definitely enjoyed them and would have had another half dozen if we didn't have all the food we had coming.   The next plate was a Caesar salad which we split. The split portion was perfect. The salad had a lot of flavor but really just tasted like regular Caesar salad nothing out of the ordinary.   The main course was a shared 18oz Dry Aged Bone in Rib Eye with an 8oz white tail lobster to complete the surf and turf. We also had roasted Brussels sprouts that were prepared with bacon, pear and chervil.  The steak comes out with three different sauces and it didn't need any of them. It was incredibly juicy, spiced perfectly and prepared to the perfect temperature. Every bite was amazing and that is all we can say about that one.   The lobster was also prepared perfectly and tasted great. I am not a big fan of butter on my lobster and this lobster didn't need it to really complete the flavor.   Finally the Brussels sprouts were very good. I am not a huge Brussels sprouts guy and these were definitely worth trying. Not the best I have ever had but really when you mix it with bacon I am not sure you can go wrong.   The food was delicious but i am still deciding if it was just better because of the night.  Regardless this food was worthy of one star.   ALCOHOL  We started with a glass of Veuve Yellow Champagne each and ended up sharing a third. The Champagne was good but a little dryer than we prefer. Still a great glass of champagne if you enjoy bubbles.   With the main course we each had a glass  of Italian Gaja Promise. This was a cabernet to go with the steak and it paired perfectly.   Overall the alcohol deserves 3/4 of a star. The only reason for a small deduction was because we didn't have cocktails so I can't really judge that and it is difficult to give a full star when I don't know how all the drinks taste.    CLEANLINESS & AMBIANCE   The Ambiance was fantastic especially for a night like last night. The table was right next to the glass looking at the Bellagio fountain.  That combined with the sexy steakhouse lighting made the experience very romantic.   The restrooms and bathroom were very clean and well maintained. I assume there is a full time team making sure that is the case.   Overall the cleanliness & ambiance gets a star.   SERVICE  The service was spectacular. The waiter knew when to come over and when to give us space on our night. He made excellent suggestions when needed and really knew his stuff.  I didn't catch his name but thank you for making the evening perfect.   One note that is important here they do have a photographer that comes by to take pictures. I am sure you can ask them to leave you alone if you like.  I know some people get bothered by this but you are in a nice restaurant at the Bellagio in Vegas.    Overall the service was perfect and deserves one star.    VALUE/PRICE  The overall value is where i am having a difficult time.  I know and understand that this was a steakhouse and it was a nice meal but the prices were a tad on the high side. For one appetizer, one salad, a surf and turf with a side, three glasses of champagne and two glasses of wine the bill came out to $400 plus.  I consider that quite significant and I would say it was only the alcohol that was over priced and the Caesar Salad.  Even as far as steakhouses go this was on the pricey side and I have to dock some stars for this.    Overall the value/price receives 1/4 a star.   In conclusion Prime Steakhouse at the Bellagio was amazing. It was the perfect place for a special night such as the night I proposed to my fiance. The overall rating is 4 stars.  We would probably return but not until we cycle through more restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip.",

Prices are high, but we knew it before we went there. I had crab legs and they were very salty I won't hav that again when we go next time, my mother had Chilean sea bass and she said it was absolutely amazing, my son had steak and he said it was good as well. Service was nice, but I wish there was a little more personality. It felt like we were served by robots.",

Both my friend and I had the New York Strip Steak and they were both very big and very tough and very chewy and we ended up eating only about 1/3 of the meal. Unfortunately this is the second or third time eating at Prime and other fancy Las Vegas steakhouses that we have been served subpar quality meat for some reason.",

    "text": "Soooooo disappointed in this place. Because this is Vegas I already expected dinner to be at least $200 +. But normally these restaurants come with the flavor so it lightens the blow to the pocket. I really wanted to have dinner here on the patio because they have the water show every 15min in the evening. I made reservations and requested seating on the patio. When we arrived at the time of our reservation we were told patio seating wasn't available & a table would be available in about 40min or so. What was the point in making a reservation (rolls eyes). We sat at the bar and ordered drinks until our patio seat was ready. The service was sooooo slow. I felt like we had to run our server down half the time or ask other servers to go get him. We ordered shrimp cocktail for an appetizer which was typical. For my entree I had the chicken which was actually good. My fiance had the steak which was extremely undercooked & not medium well like he requested. For sides we had the sweet potato mash that they put they remix on. It was interesting... I think you'll love it of hate it... I hated it. I also ordered steamed broccoli. The server brought it out with a mountain of cheese on top of it. I ended up sending it back because I specifically asked for just steamed broccoli. He offered to remake it I told him no thanks I was really over it at that point. On the bright side the water show was really beautiful. We really enjoyed that part.",

    "text": "I've been to Prime a couple times now and both times were enjoyable.   Besides the food (which I will get into shortly), I want to highlight the service.  The servers and other restaurant staff here are professional, accommodating and most importantly, have good timing on when to be at the table for any needs. I don't think this can be trained, and believe it is the servers' experience and intuition after many years in the industry.   On to the food... Standouts:   Foie Gras - if you love Foie, you will love theirs. Perfectly seared and flavored, with nice acidity on the plate to complement.   Carpaccio and Tartare duo - This is the best of both worlds. When I see Carpaccio and Tartare on the menu, I usually have an inner battle on which one to choose. Well Prime must have thought of this too and decided, why not put both on a plate! The tartare and carpaccio are fresh and the presentation is beautiful with the latticed cream (but side note, a bit too saucy for me and I would ask for less sauce or on the side next time).   Sea Bass entree - It's not a petite piece! It is a large piece of fish and cooked well.   Truffled Mash - Buttery with bits of Black Truffle folded in and garnished on top!    Next time I will be back for the Dover Sole as (I was told) they de-bone right in front of you.   All in all if you are looking for fine dining and great food, Prime is solid.  I will be back and will probably bring the family when they are in town again.",

I've had a fair amount of good steaks and eaten at wonderful steakhouses, but man this was the best steak I've ever had. I had the 30 day dry aged ribeye that I split with my boyfriend. It was the perfect amount for both of us! Their sauces were also so good, I can't even explain. We also got the truffle mashed potatoes that are only shareable for about two people maximum. The mashed potatoes were delicious as well.   Aside from the delicious food, the view on the patio is amazing. You get a perfect view of the Bellagio fountains which are breathtaking. Sitting on the patio is a must! They have heaters that make it perfect. The restaurant ambiance inside is also very nice as well, very romantic and quiet.   Do yourself and your tastebuds a favor and eat here if you have the chance! 10/10 recommend!",

Perfect view of the fountain show and it was dark in the restaurant which was nice. For the price our food was okay... absolutely nothing special...  When it was time for dessert our waiter seemed like he had an attitude for whatever reason... No idea what happened but he was very rude. Once we received our 300.00 bill the waiter asked if he wanted to charge it to the room and we said no and it seemed like that made him upset....

    "text": "Wow!! I made reservations for 5pm on a Saturday Dec 22 (right when they open) cause I wanted to guarantee a patio seat.  I got a great seat over the lake, and the fountain show was so close I even felt mist on my face during it!  Service was spectacular! But the ribeye was even better!!! Oh my, I don't get red meat very often so when I do I really want it to be worth it, and this was the BEST ribeye I've ever tasted in my life. (They brought out 3 sauces to go with the meat, but the steak was seasoned by a god and didn't need any sauce!)  I started with the salmon sushi app (crispy rice one) cause I wanted to try it so bad! Even though I knew I would be ordering a huge steak....it was yummy! But the steak was the highlight! I ordered the mushrooms on the side and they were divine!   10/10 would come here again!!",

We heard there was an exclusive Game of Thrones-themed show so we made sure we had reservations. When we arrived, the section was apparently all reserved but empty.   Ended up rushing through the meal to view the show which was totally epic and worth it. Took our food to go and enjoyed it in the room with the rest of the shows. Please give a warning or disclaimer at least though!",

I was so psyched to take my husband there.  That filet with the signature soy-shallot-ginger sauce is probably the best thing I have ever eaten on a plate. He said his dry-aged ribeye was superb.  We split the asparagus and again, perfectly seasoned and cooked.  French onion soup is beyond fantastic. I didn't want to share it LOL.  Service was  fantastic. They let us linger for 2.5 hours on a Sunday night. Make a reservation at least a week in advance for a weekend.  Splurge and go. I promise you that you will be amazed.  Dinner for 2 with cocktails with tip: $310. Hey, skip the tables and spend your money on a killer meal!",

We made a reservation for 5pm, as we had show tickets for 7:30 at another hotel so we wanted to be sure we had plenty of time to eat, relax, and enjoy each other's company. In the reservation I noted that it was our 15th anniversary and they were so sweet in giving us anniversary wishes, truffles, and a wonderful table right in front of the Bellagio fountains.  My husband had the short rib and it was so tender and seasoned well. I ordered the peppercorn-crusted New York strip steak with blue cheese on top. Perfect! It was so flavorful and cooked perfectly. We also ordered a side of truffle fries. These are not on the menu! However, they did have frittes and then truffle mashed potatoes, so I made a request for truffle frittes and they were so sweet to accommodate the request and they were delicious.   We also ordered two of their signature drinks, but for the life of me I cannot remember what they were called. Both were so good and weren't overly strong.  Thank you for such a wonderful anniversary dinner!",

Years ago I visited Prime and they hit it out of the park.    Unfortunately, I've been there twice in the last three months and left disappointed each time.  The service was very good the first time and simply average the second visit.  But the food....we'll, it was average - at best.  I ordered the dry-aged prime rib (I mean honestly, what else is a steak lover going to get?) and it was, well, tough and not very flavorful.  The sides?  Good, but nothing special.  While the setting is magnificent (we ate on the patio the second time), the experience doesn't match the reputation or the prices.  Something has happened here that has sent Prime spiraling downward.  I spoke with two friends who dined at Prime recently and they each felt the way I did about the food and the service.  Bellagio/Prime management needs to take a closer look at what is going on here.  In my humble opinion, Prime has lost its place amongst the top places to dine in Las Vegas.",

We ate at a bunch of trendy places on the strip but this place was decorated lovely, had a nice ambiance, and had delicious food. I had a Jasmine cocktail, which was incredible! Amazing tasting even. Started off with a bread basket, and a perfectly chopped caesar salad. They even split it for me and my husband so we could save room for the rest of our food. We then got the deluxe seafood tower, which was incredible. My husband and I both got the filet. They were both prepared to our liking and I really liked all of the sauces they brought you to go with it. It was nice to have options in the table. The mashed potatoes were good. Our table also got gratin potatoes and brussel sprouts. All good. Others at our table got lamb chops and the rib eye. Everyone was pleased with their choices. We ended the dinner with cappuccinos and the Prime donuts, which came out smoking! And the chocolate lava like cake. It was a very enjoyable meal and lovely setting. There is a great view of the fountains at night. You may want to request seating by the windows. I would definitely eat here again. Was it expensive? Yes. But it was worth it! Definitely a treat yourself spot.  The only thing that was off-putting was that a photographer came around to take a photo of the table. At the end they wanted us to pay $50 to get it. We gave in but I think something like this should be included with prices that are this high. It was a bit tacky.",

The darkly handsome restaurant inside the Bellagio overlooks the hotel's famous dancing fountains and provides an extra treat for diners. Not that they should need it, however, for the food here is world-class. Let's start with the steak, since that's what Prime is all about. We sampled the filet, a 10-ounce cut of wonderfully lean, pungently flavored meat ($67) that was oh-so tender to the knife and meltingly tasty in the mouth. We didn't find it required salt, pepper or -- God forbid -- any kind of sauce. The Caesar salad was a yummy accompaniment, and the French fries were amazing: fried golden brown, crunchy on the exterior and packed with a rich, potatoey (is that a word?) taste. Yes, we enjoyed some appetizers and our bread, but we really just kept raving about the steaks. They have some other entrees on the menu, but honestly, please do yourself a flavor (pun intended) and order a ribeye, t-bone or filet and savor your wisdom. By the way, the bartender is darned good, too; he made the best dirty vodka martini we've ever had. And he did it several times, too! Add into this fabulous mix very attentive yet unobtrusive service and we highly recommend Prime for your special night out.",

My pallet is open-minded enough to enjoy street meat of the gypsy varieties as well as private chef fare in the homes of UN dignitaries. After 40 some years of travel and esoteric gastro-tours all over the world I hope that of all the food genres out there that I would be considered a credible critic of steak.  Blah blah blah! Please forgive the prologue.  Jean Geaorges' Prime is essentially a perfect steakhouse. Maybe not the best but you'd be hard pressed to find much area for improvement. The setting is elegant. The service professional without being stuffy. The cheapest cuts are great. The expensive cut are heavenly. You can easily drop over $200 for a specialty cut... a la carte! Well worth it though. I went for the aged bone-in ribeye. Perfect.  All the sides are as they should be: creamed spinach, sauteed spinach, mashed potatoes, etc. The wine list is legitimate. If I were forced to find a flaw it would be in their sauces. The au poivre was too think and bit sweet. two others they offered forme to sample were lack luster, though I can't remember what they were.   Thy to get a seat close to the windows to enjoy the view of the famous Bellagio fountain. Though really there is no bad seat in the house.  Like I said, maybe not the best ever but no one will leave disappointed.",

    "text": "This place is completely worth the 5 stars.  I booked Prime for my husband's 30th birthday and it was definitely the right choice.  We were able to sit on the terrace after waiting a few extra minutes in the bar which is worth the wait as the terrace is so near the fountains you're practically in them.  We had the soup and sushi starter, the aged ribeye and scallops for main with a side of mac n cheese and we're too full to manage dessert.  The food was great, particularly my husband's steak which he said was the best he'd ever tasted (and believe me he's had plenty to compare).  The steak came with a range of sauces which was a really nice touch.  The only thing that could have made the meal better was that the staff hadn't read the note on my booking to recognise my husband's birthday.  Three other guests on the terrace were celebrating birthdays and the restaurant made a point of acknowledging this but didn't with us, a bit disappointing but certainly not enough to damage the experience!",

    "text": "Two years ago, I had a pretty disappointing experience with this restaurant's hostess, which left a sour taste on our experience despite the great wait service and food.   This Christmas holiday, my family and I decided to give it another shot. Our experience with the restaurant's (different) hostesses had greatly improved, and I was very impressed with their patience, kindness, and professionalism. The hostess kindly told us that while we had requested a fountain view, it is based on a first-come, first-serve basis, and for the moment they were all taken. She suggested another table, but first made sure to give me and my parents an opportunity to decide whether we were comfortable with this table or not. We were seated in the center of the dining room and still had a view of the fountain outside. The wait service was fantastic and the food remains amazing (tip: get the foie!). I'm impressed with this restaurant's management, it's willingness to make the necessary changes, and its employees for their professionalism and tasteful service, from beginning to end. My family and I are certainly looking forward to coming back soon.",

Ambiance makes all of the difference and this was over the top! We highly recommend the patio if you are lucky enough to score one of the few choice tables. We dined later in the evening which probably why we were able to land the choice patio seat. Prime has always been rated as one of the top steakhouses in Las Vegas but they also have a great selection of seafood. My seared rare tuna steak lightly coated in pepper was among the best I've had. My spouse and our guest shared a beautifully prepared 10 ounce filet but certainly could have chosen many other prime cuts that looked utterly amazing at the surrounding tables. Large selection of sides to share made our meals complete. Service Is certainly among the best too with multiple attendants hovering over us in a respectful manner. It's a \"prime\" experience dining a Prime.",

The mac and cheese wasn't my taste, as it had gouda and Sharp cheddar, a little too strong. The French onion soup was huge and the best I've had. I would return solely for the purpose of ordering the French onion soup. Definitely ask for a table inside and by a window so that you can view the bellagio water show while eating dinner. There is an outdoor eating area, but it's not as nice as the decor indoors.",

From the reservation a few days before all the way through they were kind, courteous and extremely helpful. I initially picked Prime for the location and knew that I wanted a seat on the patio where we can watch the fountains go off. They sat us at a table close to the water and right in the center. Could not have asked for more.  She ordered the 18oz ribeye and I ordered the beef short rib. We shared a side of the fingerling potatoes. Everything was delicious and exactly what you would expect from a fine dining experience. The bread basket has three bread options... sourdough, pretzel and a sweet raisin/walnut I believe. I have to say that I could have just ate bread and would have been thrilled. It was sooo good.  They brought out a beautiful little desert with Happy Birthday inscribed right as the fountains were going off as I had requested.  I look forward to returning to Prime down the line and know that I will receive top notch service and food.  Thank you to the staff (Charles-manager, Jesus-waiter and the rest of the team) for making our experience one to remember. You guys are awesome!",

They don't have outdoor seating.  Prime does have the outdoor garden/patio area, which is about as close as you can get to the fountain show, but it's only for cocktails.  I think Steve Wynn's group learned from that oversight as he thought through Botero and the SW Steakhouse.  Once you experience the settings at those places, it's hard to overlook it at Prime.    You'll have up close views of the fountain show here, but the better views of it are across the street at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant.",

Except the people taking selfies and photos of the fountains right next to our table during entire meal. Maybe they could discourage this somehow, it really takes away from the moment.  Full review:  I went to prime for my birthday. It was also my first time visiting Las Vegas. I had an amazing meal on the patio overlooking the fountains. I definitely recommend sitting outside if the weather is nice (two other parties in front of us at the hostess station were denied patio seating, so make sure to mention it when you make your reservation if you want to sit there!).   The service was incredible. There were several waiters in our area, all were extremely attentive, but unobtrusive.  My date and I both ordered the Dry-aged Bone-in Rib Eye. It was hands down the best steak I've ever had. It was cooked to perfection. I savored every succulent bite. It was served with 3 different steak sauces. I tasted each one, they were alright, but I don't know why anyone would want to mask the flavor of that meat! Unfortunately, the steak does not come with any sides, they must be ordered separate.   The wine list is the size of a small novel. I finally decided on a bottle of Chianti, it was superb. Every time I neared the end of my glass a waiter would appear to refresh it.   After the main course they brought me a complimentary dessert with a candle and \"Happy Birthday\" written in chocolate on the dish (I had mentioned it was my birthday on the reservation that I made far in advance). It was a nice gesture.   Be aware, this place is on the expensive side. 2 steaks, 1 bottle of wine, 2 sides, and the tip came to about $400, but it was worth every penny! I left very happy and would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a nice dinner.",

The service and food was great when we spent around $800.00 bucks with wine, caviar, Main course and dessert. Everything was perfect who came for first time at Prime. Normally we are frequently client at SW at Wynn. However, the reason I'm giving 3 stars is because after our dinner finished around 8:30pm, I asked the blonde hostess if my family and I could go to outside to take a picture and she was rude and said we couldn't. She said that if I wanted to take a picture, I should have asked before dinner. More training to care the customers....",

So I flew to vegas just for the evening to see my parents who were visiting and staying at the Bellagio....which was amazing in itself.  So we didn't have any set in stone dinner plans, but we were looking forward to a great meal.  I had heard prime was good, but my dad was actually the one who suggested it.  So we made reservation for 8:45 cuase my parents were going to see Criss Angel (which they said was so atrocious...) so they left early, and we were all starving so we went down to see if we could get in early, and to our surprise they sat us around 8:30 since they were super busy...It was 15 minutes- but still they did everything they could to help us out.  So we sat and were promptly greeted, and I mean service was wonderful and super friendly.  Our server even told us that they were understaffed that night (wow, they work well together)   So let me tell you what I was super impressed with (i'm pretty easy to please) but our server came over to open our wine...we ordered the Bethel Heights Pinot Noir, which isn't a baller wine, but a really amazing Pinot.  Anyways- so he came over to present it and as he was about to open it the table next to us very rudely kept telling him to come over while he was in the midst of opening the wine.....so I told him it would be fine if he found out what they wanted....since they were making a big to-do about it....it was actually quite absurd and rude.....and he goes \"No way, I am opening your wine, and you come first....\" now this other table had multiple bottles of very expensive wine/champagne, and were a party of over 10.....the reason I was impressed was becuase the server didn't think about the money he was making with the other table, he made sure to take care of us and give us great service.  I was really happy.  Now the food:  WOW.  I ordered the onion soup to start....I don't think once in my life have I ever been able to finish a full onion soup.....i almost licked the bowl, it was amazing.  My mom and I decided to split the 28 ounce ribeye (very very ambitious)  We obviously didnt' even come close.  But it was cooked to absolute medium rare perfection....the truffle mashed potatoes were super super super smooth- and absolutely melted in your mouth.  We also go the broccolli....okay i'm started to get hungry just talking about this food.  Anyways service was out of this world, food was incredible and the atmosphere warm and chairs were super comfy!!  I can't wait to go back :)",

So, while we waited for our meal, we watched as the private party's order of drinks and then appetizers arrived first.  We finally got our steaks, and after our meal we waited for 10 minutes before our waiter showed up again - at which time we decided to skip dessert and just get the bill.",

The wine list did not get me excited, but then again, wine's that go well with steak are not my thing.  I probably won't go back, but only because I don't love steak.",

The star rating is obviously taking into account the area - I've had slightly better in other parts of the country, but you will not go wrong with Prime.",

I usually get my usual - filet w/a lobster tail, french fries and usually whatever the waiter suggests for an appetizer.  Make sure to arrange for a reservation in advance - its a small restaurant and they sell out.  If you are staying at a suite in Bellagio - use their VIP service to try to get you a last minute reservation.  P.S. The bartenders have a terrific sense of humor.",

The steak here is top quality - I shared the porterhouse, sampled someone else's kobe (which was amazing), and, luckily, did not have to pick up the check!  Definitely a more low key, quiet atmosphere........I sort of felt like going into a food coma after eating vs. hitting the clubs to party all night (this is Vegas, after all).  One highlight was the patio outside for dessert - you get a close up view of the water fountain show at Bellagio, which is a different experience than seeing it from the street.  This was fun - and would also be a cool first date thing to impress.",

The restaurant itself is dimly lit, with super comfortable chairs, and a lovely view of the Bellagio fountains. They enforce the dress code pretty strict here, most places in Vegas will let you in wearing just about anything. This is a 1 or 2 page menu place, alot of expensive steaks, and sides you would expect in a high end steakhouse. The iced shell fish platter here is killer!  It's a quite beautiful piece. My wife had a bone in fillet which was fantastic. Don't ask for a wine recommendation from the waiter unless you won some serious cash  at the baccarat table. The pretzel bread served before dinner also blew mind.",

    "text": "The meal was pretty good but for the price ($200 each with drinks and appetizers), I expected just a little more.  I had the ribeye which was impressive but not the best I've ever had.  It had decent flavor and was actually quite tender.  My friends each had the filet. They seemed satisfied but not blown away.  They had three different sauces to go with the steaks.  This isn't really my style as most good steakhouses let the meat speak for itself.  Also, I found it odd that even though we ordered different cuts of meet, we got the same sauces to go on our meet.  Shouldn't a world class chef be more creative?  Also, the server was unable to tell  which sauces were better for each cut.    Their wine list was impressive and had all of the Napa wines you would expect to see and most other good Caliornia wines.  We went for a bottle of Justin Isosceles.  It was a very good bordeaux blend that paired well with our steaks.    The server was friendly but might have been more appropriate for casual dining than a fine steakhouse.  He joked with us that our table was typically one of the worst in the restaurant because it was one of the only tables without a view of the Bellagio fountains.  We were a group of successful 20-somethings so I'm used to not getting the best service but to make it blatant that the hostess gave us the worst table in the restaurant sort of ruined the meal.  Honestly, we hadn't even realized the other tables had a view until he said this and never would have even realized it was a bad table but once he said something, we were left wondering why we were given a bad table.",

    "text": "This was my second time at Prime and I was really looking forward to the same wonderful experience I had the first time a few years back.   To start with, this was a Monday night at about 9:00pm. My wife and I took our 2 friends there after bragging about our last experience. We did not have reservations but we were easily seated, unfortunately in the very back part of the restaurant as far away from the fountain as can be. The evening began pleasantly enough with our drink order from the bar. My wife ordered a very dirty martini and absolutely loved it. Our friend ordered a Lemon Drop and unfortunately it tasted more like syrup than anything else. She refused to send it back and made the best of it. After placing our complete order we asked the waiters assistant if we could have some bread (like we noticed the other tables were having almost immediately after being seated, not us) and the response was a bit stiff with \"I'll be there as soon as I can.\" We were eventually served some delicious sourdough bread and pretzel bread. The bread was delicious and we made quick work of it. As it was taking a while for our food to be prepared (no complaint here as good food should take some time) we asked the waiters assistant if we could have some more of the pretzel bread. His response this time was \"we are out of pretzel bread because it is so late, that is also why you didn't get any raisin bread.\" Let me state that 9:00pm in Las Vegas is not late. I am also not sure what the point was to tell us what we didn't get. My wife then asked for more sourdough and his response was \"Are you sure? You have a lot of food coming.\" After making it clear that we would still like to have the bread it was brought out without any further comment. We took it with a grain of salt and let it go.  The rest of the entrees were eventually brought out and the food was fabulous. Paying a premium at a nice restaurant is a treat for most people, like us. We absolutely do not mind doing it but when the experience falls short, then it makes it so not worth it. As much as I enjoy the food at Prime, I feel that this may have been my last visit there. I will happily try one of the many other Steakhouses with excellent Yelp reviews the next time I am in Vegas.",

I ordered it rare, but he said that would would make the meat too chewy??? I asked that it be on the rare side of medium rare. Steak arrived well done, so I asked for the next to be rare, and I would take my chances. This one came out medium well. It was supposed to be 18 oz bone in. It was a half inch thick, and couldn't have weighed 12 oz. I haven't been to the Sizzler since I was 12, but I would give the edge to the Sizzler. They offered to redo a third time, but my wife was already done. They took my steak off the bill, and I still had to pay $175 for apps my wife, 2 sides, and 2 drinks. When I asked the manager to rethink the bill, he said that was the best he could do. With all the good choices in Vegas, this should be your last choice.  P.S. I eat out 7 nights a week, and you'll see I only have 5 other reviews. I only take the time to do this if the place deserves it.",

Only place close in my opinion is Nick and Steph's in downtown Los Angeles. The ambiance is cool and elegant. It oozes class as soon you walk in. I had a dark shirt and coat on and our waiter got mad that we white napkins and went immediately and grabbed us dark place settings. It was amazing, the level of detail our waiter had. I sheepishly admitted i wasn't much of a wine aficionado but wanted something to go with my rib-eye and he went right through the menu explaining everything and made a suggestion that was simply perfect. Truffle Mash amazing, asparagus perfectly crisp yet tender the sauce that accompanied the steak... AMAZING. If you want to impress your date take her here, simply best steak house in Vegas, THE BEST. I went to n9ne and although it was a great steakhouse i can't help but feel that i cheated myself by not going to Prime.",

I am a vegetarian, and they had wonderful offerings for me, including a vegetarian tasting menu. Prime not only offers a separate vegetarian menu, they also have vegan and gluten-free menus.  Do not shy away from Prime if you are a vegetarian. They have thoughtful, creative, seasonally driven selections - you will not be limited to broccoli and rice, or a salad. Think of it, if you have a group of six, or eight, chances are someone in the group will want some sort of alternate menu and Prime can take care of you. As a vegetarian, Prime is among my favorite restaurants along with with Michael Mina at the Bellagio and several of the restaurants at Wynn/Encore, including SW, which have vegan selections. Of course, atmosphere and service at Prime is exquisite. Corkage at Prime is $50 - of course, wines you bring must not be on their list. I highly recommend Prime for steak lovers and vegetarians.",

My boyfriend comes here every time he goes to Vegas and reports they never have had an off day. I order the 8-oz fillet and asparagus and mashed potatoes. The potatoes were very creamy and the asparagus was asparagus. Really just speedbumps on my fantastic steak journey. Additionally they give you 4 sauces to have with your steak and I couldn't decide which was more delicious or if I just wanted to taste the fantastic steak on its own. Wow. Really. I am not a foodie but every bite I wanted to stop and savor.   The steak was so good I almost forgot the mention the appetizers. I had salmon sashimi that was extremely fresh delicious fish. I thought the sauce was a bit much. But it was a great price for great cuts of fish. Plentiful and expertly presented. My boyfriend got the crab cake and it was a single cake for $24. The taste was smooth and creamy, but for 1 cake I was a little disappointed for him and stuck to my salmon sashimi.  For the restaurant it is nice but not overly so. No pretentious feeling and a nice cozy place for a date. Decor is pleasant and chairs very comfortable. The wait staff was nice  and attentive but not disruptive.",

The wine list was 24 pages long! I had a glass of Rhumbauer Chardonnay ($15), an 8 oz. Filet ($40), a side caesar salad ($14), and potatoes gratin daphinois ($8). The filet was hands down the BEST STEAK I HAVE EVER HAD. It was tender, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. The caesar salad was a little lemony, but still very tasty. The potatoes were amazing. Basically potatoes au gratin, but with several different cheeses (Gruyere, Reggiano, etc.). However, one of my friends ordered a $150 Kobe ribeye, which was overcooked. He didn't send it back, but I'm positive if he had, it would have come out perfectly.  We had an amazing view of the Bellagio fountain show and we weren't even directly by a window!

    "text": "Located inside of Bellagio, I picked this steakhouse because of the reviews I saw on Yelp.  When we arrived we were shown right to our table.    When I opened the menu I was struck by how simple it was, there weren't a billion choices it was just simple and to the point.  Our server was very attentive to the details and we had an awesome dining experience.  Our waiter also reminded me of the butler from Mr Deeds.  When I came back from the restroom, I didn't notice anyone around me when I went to sit down.  But as I was moving my seat forward there was a slight push from the back, I thought I had bumped into the seat behind me.  I turned around and there was our server, whoa like super sneaky.  When I told the waiter of my stomach not feeling well, he suggested right away soda water to help settle my stomach.  He also very patient with my lack of knowledge to pair which red wine to the filet mignon my dad was having.  We also ordered the Ribbons of Tuna, Truffle Mashed Potatoes, and Creamed Spinach.      The Ribbons of Tuna was a very nicely designed dish.  The tuna sashimi was top grade because there were no lines running through them.  There was finely chopped avocado at the bottom of the dish with a sauce containing yuzu and a slight hint of spicy oil.  It was delicious, so light and tasty a great way to start a meal.    I specifically requested that the butternut squash soup be brought out as my entree since that was going be my main course.  And the staff brought it out exactly the way I wanted to.  The filet mignon came with three sauces the soy rice wine was my dad's favorite.  The Truffle mashed potatoes were fluffy and had little chopped up pieces of truffle which brought a nice texture to the dish.  I wasn't able to try the creamed spinach and it looked ok.  Overall the service was spot on, attention to detail is the way I like it, and the food was outstanding.  O yeah we also got a nice view of the fountains outside which was like the cherry on top of the ice cream.  I highly recommend this restaurant and its a great stop in Vegas.",

    "text": "Good food. All of our entrees (dry aged rib eye, seared scallops, and lamb) and sides (gratin, mac and cheese, onion rings, and sweet potatos) were great.  Service was awful! It was as if we had two waiters they just pulled offf the Strip who had never served anyone before. From the start, we had to ask for cocktails because we weren't asked if we wanted a drink. My water was never refilled the entire night! We were going to order dessert but it took them 30 min to come take our order so we just asked for the check. Then when we were trying to pay, again no attention, we were literally waving our check in the air to try and get someone's attention.   If you can stand being ignored all night long, the food is relatively good. The 3 star rating is my average - Good rating for the food. Awful rating for the service.",

    "text": "I love steakhouses and I had high expectations for the food and service and my party and I experienced mixed results.  First the service.  It was cordial but totally lacking in enthusiasm and warmth.  The waiter was talking super fast and it felt like he couldn't get rid of our table fast enough because we didn't order some $500 bottle of wine.  Only one person drinks in our party of 5 so what can I do?  Asking for water was also annoying - Sparkling or still?  Still.  Bottled?  No, tap is delicious thank you very much.  (then look of disappointment on the waiter's face).  The beef tartar & carpaccio and the tomato mozarella appetizers were good but not amazing.  I've had equally good at other restaurants.  We all ordered steaks and the most disappointing was the filet mignon.  It was very tender but it had ZERO beef taste and it was overcooked even when I asked for medium rare.  The best was the Kansas grass-fed rib-eye.  The porterhouse was good but again, not amazing.  I've had better steaks at restaurants that are half the price of this place.  Heck, even the reserve aged steaks at Vons are better than the filet mignon here.  The dessert selection was boring.  We shared the profiteroles and a cheesecake.  Not impressed.  Also, one odd thing - the bread they serve is cold.  I prefer warm/toasted bread with my dinner.  I guess this place isn't bad if your meal is comped by the casino or if you're on an expense account.",

Our table had to be one of the best in the restaurant, as it was very private with a perfect view of the fountain show.   Service was great, not too pushy, but they were always there when you needed them! Food was 4 stars. My fillet Mignon was perfect....I ate the whole thing and I'm not a steak eater, but I'm not going to be that person that goes to the steak house to order something other than steak! Sides are pretty big, and I remember ordering a side that resembled baby food, like maybe sweet potatoes, but the baby food version! Wine was delicious as well! They knew it was our 1-yr. anniversary, so they surprised us with a cute lil delicious desert that said \"Happy Anniversary\"!   I love it when restaurants pay attention to detail and deliver. That is how it should always be especially when you are shelling out $$$ for one meal!   P.S. after your meal request to have your dessert or some drinks out on the patio. We did that because we heard you could, but for whatever reason they said there were no seats available at the time even though there were...oh well!",

But here you really get what you pay for.  Steak was excellent (had the Peppercorn New York Steak, mid-rare).  Cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable.  Wine selection follows the theme of being pricey, but the server had good pairing recommendations that tied the meal together nicely.  Our table shared a few sides (asparagus, broccoli, and the mashed potatoes) all of which were excellent.  If you are in the market for a $100-$120 per person Steakhouse meal in Las Vegas, then I would highly recommend Prime.  I would definitely return on my next visit, unless the casino gods dictate that I take a more thrifty approach.",

Truffled mashed potatos , mac and cheese ,brussells sprouts, creamed spinach and more. The bread and butter were okay. They also take a group photo but charge you 35 bucks for it.

We ordered a Cesar salad, beet salad and the tomato salad. They were all very fresh and I would recommend each, especially the beet one. One person in our group also had the foie gras. It melted in your mouth and I would also recommend if that is your thing. And then there was dessert. This was my favorite part. We had chocolate cake and lemon meringue pie. Those were seeone the best desserts I've ever tatsed. The decor was also so beautiful and it made you feel like you traveled back in time. You are able to see the fountains also, which is a plus.   Now to the negatives. I took away two stars because each entree and sides fell short. Our table had the ribeye, fillets, and the sea bass. They were all underseasoned. For the price, I would expect something flavorful and tender. It was just bland a little tough. The sea bass was really disappointing. I saw a picture online of it and thought it looked beautiful but the tomatoes we're sour and the fish had no flavor and was very oily. We had asparagus, mushrooms and the tempura fried onions. They were all bland too.   Overall I would come back for the atmosphere and desserts.",

    "text": "This was probably the biggest disappointment of our trip to Las Vegas. Absolutely atrocious service. My husband made reservations for Valentine's dinner  months in advance. We were greeted promptly and seated immediately. Our waiter came right over and gave us the standard menu and wine list. After ordering some drinks we reviewed the menu... however, we didn't need the 25 minutes it took him to come back to actually take our order. There was a special Valentine's Day menu that he didn't give us initially... it only had 1 entree on it, so it probably didn't require another 10 minute wait.  Our food did come quickly after ordering (the filet and gratin were excellent, peppercorn strip was overly fatty and forgettable) We did not see either of our waiters (there were 2 serving our table) until we had finished and sat for a good 15 more minutes. No one even came to ask how our steaks were cooked. After we finished eating and our plates were finally cleared, we were offered no dessert menu or after dinner drinks, and sat with a completely empty table for 25 minutes before my husband finally flagged someone down for our check.   While we may look young, we are both professionals who dine at fine steakhouses regularly. I'm not sure if our waiter thought we were out of place, if it was busier than it appeared, or if he was just choosing to ignore us... But this was the absolute worst service we received in Las Vegas, and certainly the worst of any fine dining restaurant. We will not return.",

Served with a plethora of sauces, your typical vinegar, horseradish, cocktail sauce, tabasco.  Everything elevated on a bowl of ice. My does it feel grand. A bowl for shells conveniently located just underneath.  To prepare you for the next course, a warm damp dinner napkin garnished with a lemon to cleanse your hands.    Tartar and carpaccio - if you love it raw ;) you'll love this.  The drizzled sauce makes the carpaccio. It's delicious!     Sides - creamed spinach, truffle mashed potatoes, beans... Probably the smallest serving of side dishes I've seen.  At least you can have space to try a little bit of everything.   Steak - filet mignon *heart eyes* if this steak could be cooked any better, I doubt it. PERFECTION. just the right texture without char to the outside... Nice and tender on the inside.   Juicy and perfectly medium rare (how it should be ;) ) For the way it is seasoned I would never even think to adulterate it with unnecessary sauces.  3 sauces come alongside.  The famous one they point out, with ginger is TO DIE FOR.    I always appreciate good food, the best is the kind you crave. I read somewhere, that is the goal of the chef here.  With that sauce I refused to try, because I knew I didn't need it.  Icing on the cake, mission accomplished!  I already feel the withdrawals.   Service was excellent.   With a party of 6 I would say everything went smooth.  I'm ready for a date night with Prime!  P.S.  I forgot my designer bag at the table. It was turned in to security next the to main cage in the casino.  I was able to retrieve it as soon as I realized.  Thank you much!",

Oh yeah, and then there's the view.  The Bad - This is a Bellagio steakhouse. You're paying top dollar. I expect likewise. I ordered the dry-aged bone-in ribeye, medium rare. Came out lukewarm and under seasoned. The food came out relatively quick, so this causes some suspicion. Most steakhouses I've been to (Maestros, Mortons, etc.) usually take some time.   They provide three sauces and I didn't try any since the meat should speak for itself, or at least that's what I'm accustomed to. Maybe if I drowned the steak in one of the sauces it would've tasted better. I'm not sure. Underwhelming steak experience? Definitely.  The Verdict - Would I come back to impress a young lady with the ambience and amazing views? Sure. Would I come back for the sides? Maybe. Would I come back for the steak? No.",

We ordered a bottle of wine (house malbec; I love malbec with steak and beef, goes very well together), 2 soups (I ordered butternut squash and my gf ordered the French onion soup; both were delicious), 2 steaks (Filet amd peppercorn rub NY), 2 side dishes (onion rings and mashed potatoes), and we received complimentary dessert to celebrate our evening.   P.s. We would normally order a vegetable side dish, but I wasn't feeling a veggie dish tonight. Lol.   We also purchased photos to remember our experience! Wonderful venue, the views of the strip and water show were all breath taking",

    "text": "Prime has the winning combination which is great food in a scenic location.  The location feels very secluded and separate from the chaos of the strip. The restaurant is on the lower level along the fountains. We made a reservation and were able to get a table next to one of the large windows in front of the fountains. The table was even set so that my husband and I were both facing the beautiful view.   The feel of the restaurant is swanky and regal, but without being stiff and pretentious. The design of the restaurant was very appealing.   Our service was good as you'd hope it would be in a restaurant like this. Our waiter insisted on taking photos of my husband and I when he saw me doing my Yelp thing. The waiter and server were never far, but not in a hovering manner.   Before coming here I read so many articles talking this restaurant up and the food lived up to the hype. I had the 10 ounce Filet Mignon and my husband had the 14 ounce Peppercorn-Crusted New York Strip. We shared the Gratin Dauphinois.   The Filet Mignon was perfectly prepared, tender and flavorful. The 10 ounces was more than enough meat. The Peppercorn-Crusted New York Strip's peppercorn crust was delicious and seasoned well. This steak was also well prepared and flavorful. The Gratin Dauphinois was a sizeable portion for two. There was plenty of cheese sauce in the dish and broiled on top. Delicious.  One of the unique things about this steakhouse is that they bring out three steak sauces. The sauces offered were Soy-Rice Wine, Bearnaise, and Peppercorn. I loved all three and enjoyed trying them on both of the steaks. The meats didn't need sauce, but I always love a good sauce.  We finished the meal by splitting the Apple Pie with Maple Ice Cream. It arrived bubbling and hot. This appears to be a dish that is freshly prepared with each order.I loved the flavor of the apple pie and the delicious maple ice cream on top.  Having been to a few of the steakhouses now I would rate this among some of the best. The food is great, but the view and puts it over the top.",

    "text": "I decided to try prime tonight instead of my all time favorite \"cut\" at the palazzo.  I was greeted and sat promptly by a very friendly hostess staff.  The service has been good I was greeted quickly with water being offered almost immediately.  I say good not great due to the fact that there was nothing above and beyond done, and I was not asked by anyone how my oysters were.  The oysters were excellent and the presentation was nice as well.  I do feel that a steak presentation is important when you are purchasing a 50-150 steak but so far so good!  I chose the bone in ribeye with there \"famous\" potatoes au gratin for the main course.  The steak was accompanied by three house sauces one bearnaise and two unique all of which were good.  The steak which of course is the most important part of this meal was good, not great.  It was in desperate need of seasoning I am not sure if they expect all of the guests to drowned there steak in sauce but when I eat at a high end steak house my opinion is you should not need any dipping sauce.   This steak needed more flavor and less fat!  I know ribeyes are a fatty steak but 35-40% of the steak should not be large chucks of fat.   I am not having desert so my last comment has to be about service.  The service was ok at best not one person asked me if my steak was cooked correctly.  I was not visited by a manager which I feel is mandatory when a dinner for one costs $200.  So overall if they purchased better quality steak seasoned it at all and trained there staff to ask if a steak is cooked correctly I would give it five stars.",

We shared a 12 oz for $720 which was by far the most I've ever seen or heard of for a piece of meat but MY GOD. The taste in indescribable. We also had the prime filet mignon which was astounding. Wait staff was very friendly and put up with a rowdy member of our party with ease. I could go on and on about Prime but if you step foot in this restaurant, you must try the A5 Kobe beef. Sell your car. Whatever you must do. Give your taste buds an experience they have never had before. Amazing views of the fountain outside of Bellagio as well.

Our reservation ran over a half hour late but having a drink at the bar with a great bartender appeased the situation.  If possible, request a lakeside table as it is the best view to watch the Bellagio fountain show.  The steaks are of the best quality and all of the appetizers are excellent. I suggest ordering a few to share with the table. The oysters were perfect (I understand the irony of seafood in the desert but it's that good).  Look around and see the other diners enjoying every last morsel and once you eat a meal there, you too will understand. Definitely plan ahead and make a reservation as it is always packed.",

And we had eaten at pretty much every good rated restaurant over the last 4 days of our stay at Bellagio.  How can I constructively describe him - short from the very beginning, rude and obnoxious is best I can put it. We almost didn't dare to ask any additional questions. I understand people have bad days but it does not give the server the right to show frustration to the new customers. I am in the customer service industry myself so I understand how some difficult days can be but as nice and courteous my wife and I were we did not deserve the rude demeanor of this server. He even felt so ashamed as I could tell he noticed his attitude he didn't even bring us the check, someone else did who approached us with components and kind words to make up for his mistakes. By that time it was too late, I almost didn't leave a tip and I've never done that in my life this was the first time I tipped 5% and even that felt too much considering I never do less than 20%. The only reason why I'm not giving a 1 start review is the food was great, but it's hard to have a good restaurant experience when it comes down to one aspect of the restaurant service.",

Our waitress checked with the chef and he made a pretty standard version. Looking back at the pictures, I wish I had the fancier one from before but all is good.  + easy to make reservations through OpenTable (I requested a window seat this time if possible and we got pretty close but not exactly) + excellent service by the entire team (including the hostess that generously took a few family photos for us) + thank you myVegas - got to redeem for 2 complimentary glasses of champagne  This is truly a special occasion type of place. The wine list is extensive and very expensive. On some pages you can't tell if it's the year or the price of the bottle, haha.  + tuna ribbon appetizer - very interesting twist on the classic tartare + roasted beets - with apple, ricotta and quinoa - bone-in ribeye - I should've listened to myself from 5-years ago and not ordered it again + FILET - omg so good! (no bone-in this time because they are changing providers) + truffled mashed potatoes - still just as good! - creamed corn (albeit it was by special request, doh!) + roasted butternut square - surprisingly good with the chili and toasted pumpkin seeds",

I wish when kitchens are using any kind of hot peppers on or in a dish they would state it on the menu,so I could have them left off/out.  The Gratinee Dauphinoise potatoes were much more flavorful than the mac n cheese, so even if you dont care for potatoes.... get them.    Definitely worth the trip & cost for the experience of it.

    "text": "I don't usually leave reviews, but I feel our meal at this restaurant deserves one.   FOOD: The food was great. The oysters were wonderful. We all wanted to try the French onion soup, which they split into half portions for us (unexpected and nice of them to do). The bone in ribeye was perfectly cooked and very good, but the real star was the 10 oz filet. Honestly, I wish I had been the one to order it, because it was one of the best cuts I have ever had. The truffle mashed potatoes were a great addition as a side.   Overall, the quality of the meat was excellent. I did feel like the steak could have been seasoned more. Other than that, no complaints here.   SERVICE: Here is where things went a bit downhill. Lets start with the positives - first, the hostess was very nice and sat us at a great spot near the windows to watch the fountains. We were also visited by [who I am assuming is] the manager of the restaurant, who was very quick to respond to any requests we had. These two individuals were not only helpful, but very friendly and personable.   The negatives - from the very moment we sat down, I got the feeling we were being rushed by our server. There is a difference between being attentive and being overly pushy. Our table felt that we were experiencing the latter. Additionally, we all felt that both servers for our table were relatively unfriendly and standoffish.  I was also unimpressed by the attitude of the individual who split the check. Two of us were in Vegas on business and needed to split the check so that certain dishes were included on different cards. For some reason, this was met with frustration. In fact, the server responsible for the check walked away from me mid-sentence as I was explaining how it needed to be split up. Not a great touch.   OVERALL: The food and the atmosphere were very good. However, they weren't good enough to make up for the lack of personable/helpful service that you should get if you're paying to eat at an upscale restaurant like Prime claims to be.   Our family visits Vegas frequently but it's unlikely we will be back due to the service (and the fact that there are so many other great alternatives in the area). I would also hesitate to recommend this for business outings - no need to deal with attitude from the server over splitting the check when there are so many other restaurants who are more than willing to accommodate this type of request.",

    "text": "We recently had a pleasant dinner at Prime. Our reservation was on a Tuesday at 5:30, so there wasn't the usual crowd (weekends after 7 seem to be more crowded, in my experience). Our table looked out at the Bellagio fountains, which I highly recommend you request when making your reservation.   While they say they enforce a dress code here, I can't say that's the case. We always fell a little overdressed whenever we eat here. The last time we were here, we actually sat next to a group of frat guys who were all wearing the typical frat uniform of flamboyant pastels with khaki shorts. I've noticed most people here are dressed casually, so I wouldn't worry about getting too dressed up. As much as I like to dress up, I wish I would've just gone more casual and comfortable.   My filet mignon was delicious, as it always is. They always manage to get it just right, which is something I've had issues with at other high-end steakhouses. Admittingly, I'm not a huge fan of steak, but my husband is a self-proclaimed steak connoisseur. He loves whatever kind of steak he gets here and swears that this place beats all the other Vegas steakhouses. The only issue we encountered was with one of the sides. We ordered asparagus, and what we were served look as if the tips had been chopped off, leaving us with only half of the stalks. Considering the hefty price for a side of asparagus, we were disappointed.   The servers were tremendous and very attentive. They even were able to accommodate a strange request I had. I was wearing a very uncomfortable pair of heels and wanted to switch to flip flops, however my purse was not large enough to fit my heels. I asked if they had a takeout bag or something for me to carry my heels in. Our server was super helpful and went looking for a bag in the back. He told me, \"we've...never actually had anyone ask for a takeout bag here. Especially for high heels.\" I guess I set the precedent for first person to ask for a doggie bag for their shoes.   Although there are probably more affordable alternatives for similar food and ambiance in Vegas, we still enjoy Prime and will continue to come here in the future.",

It's perhaps the best steak I've ever had. You're gonna ask them why would I give it three stars, we'll I'll tell you. It's the service. Sometimes feels non existent. I've ate here maybe more than 30 times in my life and I've come to a realization that service is going down year after year.

But if I am paying that much for food I think it should blown me away. The staff was very attentive and did an amazing job, the atmosphere was spot on for a fancy night out at the Bellagio. But the food was not as amazing as I wanted it to be. It tasted like any other cookie cutter steak joint with predictable options.   The old fashioned was not balanced very well and was cloyingly sweet. The bread basket had 3 different bread options, pretzel, sourdough and a raisin with butter sprinkled with salt. The sourdough was the best, pretzel was a little dry.   Appetizer: I shared the salmon sashimi that was decent. The sauce had a nice kick to it, salmon tasted fresh and I did enjoy the little fried rice square underneath   I ordered the spring pea salad which was good. The dressing had a slight little bite to it but complemented the perfectly cooked soft boiled egg. This is a small side salad that was fresh and light.   The mustard crusted salmon was the highlight of the meal. It was a big piece of salmon, cooked to perfection. Crunchy skin and a little pink inside. It was on a bed of spinach with beets. All complemented each other nicely.   Some of the other guests at the table had the steak, crab, crab cake, onion soup and wedge salad. They all seems pleased with their choices.   Dessert: donut flight. They push a bottom, there is the awe of some smoke, but that was exciting as it gets. That is Vegas for ya!   5 donuts of different flavors, blueberry, gran marnier, chocolate, old fashioned and cookies and cream. I have had better donuts at a food truck.   To me not worth it. There are more inventive restaurants in Vegas for less $. Unless you are looking specifically for a restaurant in the Bellagio that has a view of the restaurants that serves steak I would walk on",

    "text": "We were two couples dining here over Memorial Day weekend. One in our party had dined here over a decade ago and raved about it. Our waiter was friendly yet professional until we received our food. We noticed that nobody asked how it tasted. Probably for good reason as all four of us were disappointed in our main courses. However, let's start with the good. Salads were on point. I even ordered the \"warm seafood salad\"....so glad we inquired about what exactly comprises the dish. Turns out it was like a warm seafood cocktail with citrus juice versus tomato as you would find in a Mexican seafood cocktail. It was fantastic. Not really much lettuce though so don't be fooled by the name!  The other salads tried were the BLT wedge and the caesar....these salads were pretty good. I was the only one who did not order steak....opting for the Chilean seabass instead. It would have been fine except that my \"warm seafood salad\" appetizer was actually warmer temperature wise than my main course. My pet peeve is dining on room temperature food but we were visiting and having fun with our conversation so I didn't say anything.   I got to try the non-aged ribeye, and it was not cooked properly. One in our party is very high up in the food industry, and she said point blank that it hadn't been seared correctly (which caused it to be almost rubbery on the inside). They also didn't find the steaks to be seasoned very well.  We did not give feedback.  It almost seemed our waiter knew the food was not cooked properly.  In fact, the 3 people who ordered steak only ate half  and yet our server didn't ask if we wanted a to-go box.   The sides were the most disappointing. We have all dined at these high end steak restaurants and know that $20 sides are the norm but we also know that they are usually enough to share. We ordered three sides and they came in the tiniest ramekins. The truffled potatoes were good but the broccoli was terrible. In fact, even though it came in a small ramekin we could not get past one bite. The spring pea side was also not bad but again too small.   We spent well over $800 for 4 people and were very disappointed.",

When we came for our dinner, not only were we not outside, we were far in the back and couldn't see a thing. Saddest part was there were empty tables between us and the windows.   Food was fine. Nothing we had was bad and the steaks were cooked exactly to order. With that being said, I think there are better steak houses in Vegas, especially if you are seated inside with empty tables around you.",

We were almost immediately disappointed when we were told a seat overlooking the Water Show would take an additional 30-45 minutes before it could be available. Never mind that I specifically asked for a table overlooking the water.   Like all the high end strip restaurants, you pay for the ambience and Prime was no exception. The staff were extremely attentive, we never had to ask for water or look for our waiter.  I love their many choices of bone-in steaks! It just adds so much more flavor to the point that you wonder why so many restaurants don't.  For the price, however, there are cheaper alternatives for food that are just as good. If you're paying more than $400 for a meal you expect to be blown away and unfortunately we were pleased just not wowed.",

    "text": "My boyfriend visited Vegas a few years ago on business and stayed at the Bellagio, and wanted to eat here...but no one else was willing.  This meal, as well as many others, were all good, some really good, and some awesome.  I have to say, for the prices here, I did expect a better meal.  I forgot my reading glasses, and it was relatively dark inside.  Why we weren't seated on the completely empty patio, I don't understand.  I got the bone in rib eye (rib eye is my favorite steak), and it was good, but not nearly as tender as I expected.  I also got the creamed spinach, and THAT was really good (I love good creamed spinach), my boyfriend got the surf and turf, which he stated was \"good\".  The steaks came with sauces, a ginger one, a bourbon one, and I think the other was a Bearnaise.  The ginger and bourbon one were really good; however, my mindset is that a really good piece of beef doesn't need a lot of helped if seasoned and cooked well.  The highlight of my meal was actually not any of the food, but when my boyfriend told me I was the love of his life!  At 60 for me, and 59 for him, that was wonderful to hear!    I did get dessert, and that was the best food portion of the meal, Meyer lemon creme brulee!  Now, THAT was really delicious!  I'd go to Prime again just for dessert to have it.",

They get major points for seating us at a table with a view of the spectacular Bellagio fountain show but I just thought the food fell super short.   We got some cocktails, my extra dirty martini was excellent but how hard is it to make a good martini? For dinner my mom and I shared the broccoli with cheese and jalapenos, baked potato and the bone-in dry aged rib eye. The rib eye was cooked the way we asked but the marbling was like beyond fatty. It was one of the worst cuts of meat I've ever had, maybe it's because I'm from Wisconsin and I just get amazing steak there but wow I was so unimpressed. I ate two pieces and could barely stand to eat the rest. The broccoli was whatever. The baked potato was a highlight for me but again, how hard is that?  I wouldn't recommend going to this restaurant, I'm sure there's better steakhouses in Vegas. Also, there are other restaurants with a view of the Bellagio fountain.",

If you tell them medium rare, it'll come medium rare. We all know at least one steak house that will bring out our steaks at a medium when we ordered medium rare......   The sides here are phenomenal along with an extensive wine list. After all, it is a five star MGM owned property.   Besides all the delicious food and impeccable service, the best feature about this restaurant is the view of the Bellagio fountain firing off water show after water show during dinner!",

For as fancy as Prime is the service staff makes you feel welcome. Based on that alone, this should get five stars.  I am almost hesitant to review as this is my first and only visit.  With how much it costs to eat here about $500 with wine for two, it might be awhile before we get back.    The wine recommendation by the sommelier was disappointing.  $225 '13 Washington cab sauv blend that was underwhelming.  This bottle would have been disappointing at $50.  Wanted to try something new but should have gone with an old standby.  1/5 stars on this.  Started with tomato soup and onion soup and both were very good.  We had peppercorn NY Strip at wallet busting $82 and sea bass $48.  The strip was cooked perfectly just overwhelmed with the pepper.  It was literally piled up on top.  I love pepper but has to scrape it off.  The fish was good.  French fries were average.  Food wise, this wasn't even close to our neighborhood steakhouse in Texas and about double the price.  Food 3/5 stars.    My friend has been telling me this is his go to steakhouse in LV for years.  Finally we went for a special occasion.  Even with the weak bottle and average slightly above average food and cash crushing bill, we will return because of the amazing ambiance and really great service.",

We wanted to try a lot of different things, so we ordered a lot and split it all. We started with the shrimp cocktail, which was divine! The shrimp were huge and were soft and tasty, especially with the delicious cocktail sauce. We each ordered a French onion soup, thinking that the bowls would be small-- wrong! The bowls are huge, but the soup is so outstanding that we both ate every single bit of it. Prime's French onion soup is by far the best I've ever had. You have to order it!  For the main course, we had the dry aged bone in ribeye. The steak was perfect cooked and seasoned. There was enough salt on the outside to bring out the delicious natural flavors. Their steaks come with three sauces on the side and my favorite by far was the soy/ginger/garlic sauce. It's to die for!! For sides, we had the potatoes au gratin and the creamed spinach, both of which were excellent.   We were able to sit near the bar and have beautiful views of the Bellagio fountains, which made dinner all the more special. Coupled with the excellent service from the staff, our dinner at Prime was genuinely incredible. I'm already looking forward to returning to Las Vegas and having dinner at Prime again.",

I have dined at all three, and they do not disappoint.    Our party of four started with raw oysters, a tomato crab bisque, Caesar salad, tomato and burrata salad, and a French onion soup - all were great starters following some delicious cocktails.    Mains were a ribeye, short rib, filet, and lamb chops. Sides included mac and cheese.  The ribeye was perfectly cooked, and I tried the melt in your mouth short rib, which was divine; the lamb chops were super tender with an interesting accompaniment of cucumber, olives, and goat cheese.   Desserts were a carrot cake and their donut medley.  The cake was terrific, but the donuts were a disappointment.  The donut presentation was amazing, but they were dry as a day old or more. Even the chocolate and caramel sauce couldn't save them.    Service was efficient, professional, and fairly unremarkable - they did their job without attention or flair. A cocktail was accidentally spilled by a server, but they tidied up quickly.    Prime is a nice treat, but 5-stars are reserved for the more creative Le Cirque and Picasso amongst the Bellagio signature choices.   It's great, but plan on hitting a small jackpot as well to help pay for the fountain show.",

We had made reservations a couple months ahead and requested a table by the window to see the fountains and also noted the celebration. Both of those requests were accomplished!  Our waiter, Russell, was extremely friendly and had a great rapport going with us and other tables in his area. He made suggestions and up-sells that worked out well.  We each had a salad to start (beet, Caesar, and tomato mozzarella). All were delicious. For meals, there were 3 dry aged rib eye and I had the Dover sole. The sole was like butter melting in your mouth. Everyone who had the steak said it was very good, not the best, but very good. For sides, we had the mushrooms- which I wasn't a huge fan of and the gratin dauphinois-which I liked a lot.  They then brought out a plate of truffles with congratulations on it, which was very thoughtful! We were all full at this point, but were convinced to order dessert which was the best way to end a great meal. I'm not a steak person, but I enjoyed my meal at Prime. It's expensive, but I think worth it.",

When you make your reservation they ask if you are celebrating anything, which we were and then they surprised us with a FREE dessert that said happy anniversary, such a sweet touch. As soon as you walk in the door they seat you, didn't even wait two seconds! Figi bottled water, amazing drinks, truffled mashed potatoes, what more could you want! There was a photographer taking pictures of your table so we got one, $45 for two poses that come in a frame, pricey but not too bad. Love Love Love this place, will definitely be back! Dont get me wrong, the place is pricey, for us its a special occasion only type, but worth every penny, be sure to sit on the patio or ask for a view of the water show in your reservation!",

The people are super nice and the service is exemplary. Decor is top notch. But I don't go to a steakhouse for service and decor. I go there for steak. Please go ahead and mistreat me but if you're going to charge me $85 for a ribeye it better be the best darn ribeye I've ever had. It needs to be at the level of J&G in Phoenix or Prime 112 in Miami for these kinds of prices. Probably even at the level of Peter Lugers (sp?) in NYC. Well it's not even close. Though I'll leave out good ol' Ruth's Chris since it's pretty hard to beat a steak that's drenched in sizzling butter. Both of the last two times I was at Prime, the ribeye was meh - gristle-y and a little on the chewy side. Totally not what I would expect from a $60-70 aged, prime ribeye. Had a piece of my neighbor's filet and it was a little better. Still rather flavorless to be honest. The sides are microscopic - they have no shame charging $14 for amounts to 4-5 Brussel sprouts. Definitely NOT sharable among 2-3 people as they say their sides are.  Given their level of service and the decor, it would just be wrong to give them a 1-star. But the food quality really just isn't there and I definitely will not go back.  Goes to show that Pavlovian principles only apply to dogs. But no really, next CES, I am not subjecting anyone to Prime.",

    "text": "I was very lucky to eat at prime and have my dad pay the bill.   I've eaten at nice steakhouses before such as Mastro's and BOA, and I've concluded that most top-of-the-line steakhouses are very similar in their menus. Other factors are what can make the difference, such as service and ambiance.  This place does have spectacular views of the Bellagio Fountains, but inside the design was a bit tacky. I get it, I get it, it's supposed to feel like an opulent steakhouse from many decades ago with chandeliers, columns, big drapes everywhere, and waiters that bring food out on rolling carts. But for me, it was a little stuffy and got pretty old after a while.   My impression of this place is that it's trying very hard to be a classic fancy steakhouse. But I was just left with chairs that were uneasy to maneuver and a waiter who seemed kind of absent. I've had better waiters at a Chili's while ordering nachos. This guy was only at our table a handful of times, while an army of other people kept our water glasses filled. He didn't check on us nearly enough  throughout our meal and wasn't very personable.   (And they could stand to update their bathroom)  At Mastro's, you do get amazingly attentive service in a more modern and classy place. Although, just as at Mastro's, you do get an amazing steak at Prime.   As for the food, my initial impression was of how small the menu was. There are maybe a dozen entrees. There are a large number of side dishes to choose from, though.   I would say that the sauces--particularly the bernaise--make the steak entrees very good. I ordered a filet mignon medium rare. It was cooked nicely, with a juicy and red interior, but the outside of the steak was dry.   The sides are nothing to write home about, except for the black truffle mashed potatoes. These are whipped clouds of carbohydrate perfection. The earthy black truffle is generously shaved on top and is abundantly stirred throughout. (But let's be honest, you could shave black truffles on anything, even a twinkie, and it'd be delicious.)  Eating at prime was a wonderful experience and I do recommend it. But as for its rank among other steakhouses, I would say it falls toward the upper middle. With Mastro's still on top.",

Comparatively, I would rather eat at Botero (at the Encore) or Jean George's (at the Aria).   We began the meal with oysters which were very fresh. They only serve Fanny Bay, so don't expect variety. We followed with an over dressed and average tasting Caesar salad.  The biggest disappointment though is the quality of the meat. I had the bone-in ribeye and my girlfriend had the filet. Both pieces of meat were good, but not worth $66 and $67 respectively. They tasted like choice meant you could get at Costco. The Brussels sprouts are very good but the mashed potatoes have way too much butter.   The best part of the meal was the cinnamon bread pudding. Everything about it is phenomenal, from the presentation of the melting chocolate dome to the apples at the bottom.   We will not be returning.",

It is very expensive, however, and only a few select tables get the views of the fountains.    We started out with orders of Salmon Sashimi and Ribbons of Tuna.  Both were incredibly flavorful and exceeded our expectations.  The Ribbons of Tuna comes with a radish and ginger marinade that completely rocked my world.  I was not sure if I would like it or not, but I ended up using bread to soak some of it up once we finished the tuna.  I highly recommend it!  Everyone in our party ordered steak.  I opted for the special which was a bone-in filet.  The steak came out cooked to perfection and I savored every single bite.  Fantastic!  It was not the best steak I have had, but nothing has ever held a candle to the Wagyu steak I had back home.  I really wanted to try it here, but I just thought it was too expensive ($30 per ounce).    The side dishes are very good, and the portions are large enough to share.  I opted for the Tender Broccoli with Truffle gouda fondue.  It was rich, and I couldn't finish it.  By then I was already full from the appetizers and steak.    Our service was top notch, and I expected nothing less.  I have little doubt that we will be back again soon!",

There was 3 different sauces for the steak that you can try but the steak was good enough on its own even without the sauces.  We also shared sides of the cauliflower and steamed asparagus which was also very good. We were seated close to the window and had a great view of the fountains.

    "text": "So where to start. The server was generally rude. We tell him where we live and he starts talking about his timeshare there and how he can't be bothered to play at anything but the best clubs there. It was almost like he was talking down to us but kind of funny at the same time because we honestly don't really care.  I was hosting a corporate dinner there and this guy was going for the company card with no mercy. Ask for a wine selection and he suggests a bottle that is on special for $140, so I select it. Well, he billed me $255/bottle so much for it being on special, I missed that when i went over the bill because I was looking at the up charge on the steaks.   He asks our guests if they would like something to start with, perhaps some caviar and a seafood tower made special for us. One of them spoke up and said we just came from an event where we had all of that. Before we could ask for other options, he looked annoyed and walked away, no give me a second, no i'll be right back, literally turned around and walked away. Our guests and I got a chuckle out of it. Then someone jokingly pointed out that the seafood app was $65/person and the caviar was up to an extra $200.   The server comes back after literally 15 minutes to take our order and starts the hard sell again. As we go around the table, some of the guests order the filet and he looks at them and says \"your want that bone in right?\", so they said yes, well no mention that the bone in is an extra $20 per guest. Its not a big deal but its the way he did it, his intentions were so obvious, he was just so slimy. Every suggestion he made was the most expensive thing he could think of. We went along with it but even the guests got a laugh out of it when he walked away. One commented that he should be a used car salesman with how apologetically sly he thought he was being. He hit the deserts and scotch hard as well, we just played along at this point. The guy was such a tool. Anyway, the bill came, I gave him a shitty tip and got out of there. This is the first time i have given under 15% ever. I know these people live off their tips and its a big deal but this guy was just so slimy i couldn't support it. Anyway, i'll never, ever, ever go back. The rest of the meals we had in vegas were great. We hosted a dinner at Sinatra's and it was awesome, we definetly spent way more per person which really didn't matter but when we left, we felt like I had been served well and got great food. It was a relaxing environment with class. Not some guy druling over your corporate card hitting you up like a used car salesman selling an 1985 caddilac.    Anyway, the food... The good:  Bone in filet was amazing. Really well cooked, well seasoned and good sized. Salads were good as well, nothing out of this world but good. Desert was amazing. It really shined.   The bad The steak tartar was terrible, its one of my favorite dishes normally but they had some kind of sour cream sauce on it and it was chopped in chunks with lots of big fat hunks. I would have sent it back but just didn't have the energy to deal with our server. He probably would have suggested that I wash the taste out with the Louis XIII and 2 ounces of caviar while he prepared a new \"special for me\" tartar for like $600...   So i leave you with this. If you want to go to a \"5 Star\" steak dinner hosted by a shameless used car salesman, this is the spot.",

Despite having a reservation, we had to wait an additional 15-20 minutes to get seated. Wait staff were walking around the room but rarely stopped by without being flagged. Our waiter lacked any kind of warmth and was quite gruff when I commented that the small sample of wine he poured was too dry for my taste and requested something different. I could understand if this occurred after opening a bottle but this was a tiny pour from a wine they sell by the glass. His demeanor was condescending and rude. The food itself was very good: the oysters, bacon-wrapped shrimp, pea soup, and wagyu were all hits with the table. When your party of 4 is paying roughly $200 per person, however, both the food and service need to be on point. Sadly, this restaurant only delivered on the former.",

    "text": "Very enjoyable experience. Classy ambiance, nice service and very good food. Some detail on each:  Ambiance - The restaurant is nicely decorated with long curtains and the tables were well spaced so that you weren't sitting on top of anyone else. They played great standards in the background (Sinatra, Tony Bennett, etc.) One of the biggest pluses is the setting -- you're right next to the Bellagio fountain. It definitely adds to the experience to be able to watch the water cannons fire off every 10 minutes. Be warned, though, I don't think every table has a good view of the fountains. You might want to request that when you make your reservation.  Service - All of the service staff, from the hostess to the busboys to our waiter Russell were very friendly. Everyone was polite and asked how you were doing. This is the kind of class you expect from a nice steakhouse. On the other hand, Russell was actually almost a little too chatty. When he found out we were from New York, he took the opportunity to tell us about his daughter's recent trip to New York with her friends and on and on he went. This happened a couple of other times too. Listen, it could've been much worse. He was very friendly and offered good advice about the food. But someone just needs to remind him that people don't go out to eat to make friends with the waiter.  Food - Smallish house cocktail list. My wife enjoyed the house cosmopolitan. I ordered a Chimay Red from the good-sized beer menu. For dinner, I had the 21-day aged bone-in filet mignon special. The waiter said it was 8-10 ounces but when the plate came out it was definitely at least 10. Was overcooked just a tad (more like medium than medium rare) but had excellent flavor anyway that was even better with some of the waiter-recommended soy ginger steak sauce. My wife had a New York strip which was served already marinated in a soy-ginger glaze. That, too, was very flavorful. We added a side of the brussel sprouts and pancetta, which we gobbled up eagerly. My wife's only complaint was that her steak knife was actually quite dull -- she traded knives with me and even though I had the more delicate cut of meat, I still had some difficulty making a clean cut in my filet. For dessert, my wife enjoyed a delicious bread pudding and I struggled to finish a large, tasty trio of raspberry, coconut and mango sorbet.",

We ordered the bone-in rib eye and the porterhouse and both were cooked AND seasoned to perfection (very important). The steaks were juicy, tender and packed with great flavor, and every single bite tantalized our taste buds more and more. Mine was so good that I didn't want to dip any of my 16 oz steak into the three sauces provided (i thought they were a bit too strong and didn't let the steak itself shine through), but my friend had no such qualms. After declaring it the best steak he's ever had, he fell in love with the miso sauce and proceeded to dip every single piece with the sauce since he loves strong flavors. So either way, it's melt-in-your-mouth kind of good steak.  We also ordered a side of whipped sweet potato and that was also amazing. A smooth, creamy texture with a hint of ginger to really let the sweetness shine through.   And we were seated next to the Fountains. BEST EVER.",

We got to sit right where they show the water show. It was pretty great :] . They ordered an onion soup for me because I can't eat seafood....fantastic. So cheesy..mm!  I ordered the filet mignon..AOSDOAJDSOJ It just pretty much melted in my mouth! Never tasted anything so amazing..  My sister also ordered the truffled mashed potatoes...best I have EVER tasted. It was amazing.  Of course a very pricey place.  It was the boss's girlfriend's birthday that day. Usually restaurants would bring out like ice cream, or a slice of cake..NOT HERE.  THEY BROUGHT A FULL CAKE. It was HUGE. I was so shocked..and...it was delicious :]   DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!",

    "text": "Prime is a quiet decadent experience.    Call ahead and make a reservation with a table near the window.  Not only is the food and service impeccable, this is the best place to see the Bellagio water show, which plays every 15 mins after 8 pm.  It's an emotional experience from the windows and ambiance of the restaurant.   If you're here in the summer, they have a patio where you can have a romantic dinner on the terrace over looking the water.    When you're in Vegas, it's nice to get away from the lights for a few hours, and devour a decadent meal.  The decor here is subtle, reminds me of the London West Hollywood.  Warm candle light, with hints of modern styled art deco patterned glass on the ceilings, and the walls.  Luxurious velvet curtains in deep browns and periwinkle, and fresh cut cymbidium orchids (my favorite).    RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FOOD:  You really can go wrong here, but Here are my faves from the menu:  -Succulent Lamb Chops  -Bone in Fillet  -MUST TRY Warm Shrimp Salad.  (Worth coming into the bar and ordering this with a glass of wine) -Side of Crab Leg  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR WINE:  If you've won big at the slots while you're at Vegas, by all means indulge.  They have an extensive wine list, some rare French wines that run over $60,000!  If you're looking for robust red wine at a reasonable price point, try Faust, Cabernet 2006.    Sometimes you get what you pay for, and at Prime, the ambiance, the service, the food does not disappoint.  Indulge while you're in Vegas.  Life is short;  Live a little.",

It was 20 minutes before our server arrived.  The food is average.  The presentation is lovely, just like the website pictures, but the chef needs to re-taste some of his signature dishes.  Steaks were beautiful but dry, onion rings, beet salad -  not flavorful.  Great service and attention to your customers can make up for just average food even when it is expensive but even great food can't make up for poor service or lack of interest in your customer's experience.

Service was a bit slow and the $70 steak I ordered was so salty I almost couldn't eat it.  I was too impatient to send it back so I ate it.  Mine potatoes gnocchi was not too good.  It lacked texture and firmness.  Can't comment on desserts as we did not order. The atmosphere was very dark and sleepy.   A little more light would be better,  The real thing that is dropping the star count in my eyes was the pushiness of the photographer that intrudes on your table and starts takin photos.  She shows up at dessert with the photos and basically assumes you are buying them.  When you decline she gets huffy.   For the level of restaurant and the prices I am not interested in being hustle into buying picture.   Prime should consider this and develop a softer approach.",

He eats steak all the time and didn't enjoy it but we were really hungry and in a rush so even though the waiter offered a new piece,  we didn't have time to wait.  They took of our wine off the bill which was nice.",

Arrived and our table was clearly ready (could have come earlier?) and there were several large parties that hadn't ordered their entrees (why MUST we be here at 10:15? The kitchen is clearly still open) *Had a comp sent from our host but the front door staff was unable to locate it and after two people came to our table during our meal it was finally located (organization??) *Our server was as bland as my filet,  he had zero personality and no enthusiasm (long shift?) *Filet was ordered medium (preggo lady here, but it was nowhere close so I could only eat a few bites and didn't take it to go) sadly it needed the sauce they privided...not my kinda steak plus it was tough *Husband loved his rib eye but that was the highlight of our meal, the bacon wrapped shrimp was a close second, and the creamed spinach in third *Asparagus salad, mushrooms, fingerling potatoes, chocolate cake and creme brulee were boring at best *There was a really nice back waiter with a unique name from LA that deserved praise. I want to say Rajuk but I'm sure I've moved the vowels around and this is as close as I remember but he was very personable, funny and kind. Give him a promotion asap! *I really enjoyed dining at Jean Georges in the Aria and in the future I'll stick to my waygu beef. Good bye Prime.",

My party made a reservation well in advance and requested to sit in the patio overlooking the Bellagio fountain. It was July and hot as balls, so they gratefully did not seat us outside, but we had a window seat to see the wonderful fountain show time and time again.  It was great.  Now the Steak.  A good steak needs no additional sauces.  This one did not, it melted in your mouth.  However, they provide sauces and they were so good.  Such a great compliment to an already great piece of meat.  It's a beautiful restaurant.  It's classy but not overly done.  The staff are knowledgable and warm.  It's an overall great experience.  Anytime I am in Las Vegas I will be eating there.",

Probably one of the best steaks I've had my entire life. No joke, so yummy and full of flavor. They brought out a nice cake ball for my bday and that was yummy too. We were seated out in the patio and even though it was a cold January rainy night we stayed warm with the heat lamps and saw the beautiful water show from our seats. Would certainly go back for another special occasion dinner or if I'm in town without my kids.",

Probably one of my top, favorite restaurants of all time.  -ATMOSPHERE: An exquisite experience with wonderful and attentive staff. One feels like a whimsical princess or royalty as the staff all make room for individuals to pass through the restaurant with ease. Their recommendations and service is fitting for this restaurant. I loved the beautiful, classy decor and low light setting.  -SEAFOOD: Large platter of various crab legs and oysters. Delicious, fresh and as good as it gets!  -STEAK: At some steak houses, people will fight with me to ensure I order the medium well rather than well done. (I do not understand this. I absolutely hate any pink in my meat and will feel sick looking at pink so how can you know what my taste buds will enjoy?)  As snooty as this sounds, I can tell how fine the dining experience will by the response I get when ordering a well-done filet mignon. Here: no funny looks or push back on my request. (The same response for my friend's extra well-done rib-eye)  I am happy to share that a well-done filet mignon is still very tender and absolutely delicious here. No chewy, jerky style meat. They know how to cook their steaks!  All meat entrees came with an assortment of fine sauces: Soy-Rice Wine (Favorite), Bearnaise, Peppercorn, Miso-Mustard  -SIDES: Creamed Spinach (I'm still drooling over the though of this, HIGHLY RECOMMEND), Truffle Mashed Potatoes (Probably the best truffle mashed potatoes I've had in my life. HIGHLY RECOMMEND), Mac & Cheese, Glazed Market Mushrooms, French Fries, Roasted Cauliflower",

It use to be a quiet, intimate atmosphere. It now has a hectic feel to it. The background noise is terrible. But to the dinner. We love the chilled seafood platter. It is still good but the crab legs were soggy and size of the platter has decreased by a third, with an increase in price.  My wife had the Australian lobster. It was cooked perfectly and was delicious. I had the dry aged bone in ribeye. I always order it med+. It arrived undercooked. I did not send it back but probably should have. The sides have always been excellent. We split the steamed asparagus and mashed potatoes. Still excellent. Prime is still one of our favorites and I'm sure we'll be back. It's just sad to see an old friend decline in quality.",

Prime is located in the Bellagio, down a set of marble stairs facing the fountains. Now let me tell you, view and decor, absolutely me, fancy, fancy, fancy and that is 5 stars in my book, however, food..... Good, but not unforgettable. My husband ordered a $70 Porterhouse, which is a downgrade to his usual $120 Japanese Waygu, needless to say, he didn't quite like it. I thought it was perfectly cooked, he thought it to be way too salty. Oysters and wedge salad were good, and my Chilean Sea Bass was decent, but I have had better. Bread basket, I could do without, not impressive, and cocktails were ok. However, I was impressed by their Murano chandelier that hangs in one of the private dining rooms, only because I have had the pleasure to stare at the exact same one, but smaller, hanging in my parents dining room still to this day. Overall, it was  nice quiet dinner, enjoying each other and of course sitting there all gussied up, but I would probably pass and make this a one and only time.",

    "text": "One would think that the combination of top notch casino hotel-resort and world-class heritage right next to the famed Bellagio Fountains would mean this would truly be a outstanding meal executed from start to finish.  I was thinking the same thing, but I was wrong.  While Prime remains a \"must-go\" for any deep pocketed banker, surgeon, or executive attending a convention, it retains a overpriced, pretentious atmosphere that at times a turn-off.  Prime is popular destination for the crowd that is happy to spend other people's money.  Being a walk-in, I foolishly discov ered that reservations means \"call us two weeks or more in advance\".  Left with only one option, a seat at the bar, I took it and was pleased with a view out the window towards the Fountains.  The Bartender did a awesome job of taking care of me with quick service, good conversation, and, as I watched, well crafted drinks.  Eating here is strictly a-la-carte, which means you WILL pay dearly for any sides you order.  This wasn't a surpise to me.  I selected the $64 Miso Soy New York Strip, medium rare, and added Grautin Dauphinci with Steamed Asparagus.  I added a glass of Gajara Promis Toscana, an Italian red blend.  My steak arrived decided well-done.  Having waited over 30 minutes for my food to arrive, I was quick to complain to the Bartender (my server) and he offered to return my steak for another.  Based with a decision that might cost me 30 more minutes for dinner, I chose to keep my current portion.  To me, there was no point in arguing since I was small-fry compared to much of the clientele.  Had I been someone the likes of Anthony Bourdain, any criticisms would have been respected.  While not cooked to order, the steak was nevertheless a choice cut, tender and juicy.  The Grautin and Asparagus was hearty portions that paired very well with the steak.  The bartender did comp give me another glass of Toscana for my inconvenience.  Perhaps a discount on the meal would have been more appropriate.  My first thought after the hefty tab is I could have done much better at home on my own grill.  My main gripe is restaurants like these are supposed to blow your mind, not just your paycheck.  The pricing didn't bother me at all; in fact I expected it.  Next time in Vegas, which won't be long away, I plan to give Gordon Ramsay's STEAK a try.  I can always watch the fountains from either the street side or from the view from my room at the Vdara.",

I called that night to inform them we'd be 15-20 mins late, that's when I found out they weren't expecting us. So of course, they already gave away the window seats I requested. It was an understatement to say I was upset. I made these reservations weeks ago...  However, when we arrived, the prime windows seat for 2 people were taken, but there was one still left, and they sat us there. Even though for some reason, the traditional water show did not go off, we were delighted to get the table with the view.  Dinner was phenomenal. From the rib eye to the chocolate cake at the end, it was great. The restaurant is beautiful. Our server, Beau, was attentive, efficient, and friendly, ending our dinner with a complimentary dessert to congratulate us on our anniversary.   A definitely must...

They did not rush us and went through the menu thoroughly if needed. I am on a special diet and they were able to accommodate without any problems! I ordered the filet mignon with lobster, which was amazing. The filet originally came out a little over done, but they quickly remedied the situation and I had a new one cooked perfectly, and quickly without any blemish in our dining experience. The food was delicious and plentiful. The overall experience was well worth the price and we will be back every time we come to Las Vegas. It's no big secret that Las Vegas is becoming the food capital of the US, and Prime at Bellagio is definitely setting the bar! They even brought us a dessert with a candle and decorated with anniversary wishes on it! They definitely went beyond what was expected and deserve 5 Stars! Don't miss this place!",

    "text": "Absolutely fabulous!!!  Quick Vegas trip with my 2 adult daughters last weekend to celebrate one of their birthdays, and Prime was as perfect as I had hoped.  We had an 8:00 Sunday evening reservation, arrived a few minutes early, the hostess was lovely, and we enjoyed our 10 minute wait at the bar taking in the beautiful restaurant decor.  We were then seated on the patio as requested with a \"Prime\" view of the fountain that made our dinner that much more enjoyable.  The wonderful breads brought out at the beginning were as described in reviews. We split a Caesar salad to start (nicely presented to us in 3 separate plates) and all 3 of us ordered filets with the steaks done to perfection.  We also split the yummy truffle mashed potatoes. I wish I could remember our excellent server's name, but he ended our fantastic meal with a birthday plate of pretty chocolates.  He also never rushed us which I greatly appreciated.  It's pricey, yes__with 4 drinks and 20% tip included, a little under $400___but so worth it and I would dine at Prime again in a heartbeat!",

This dinner was specifically in honor of my boyfriend's best friend's 40th birthday. We requested window seating and were luckily seated at a table that gave us a front-row view of the water show at the Bellagio.   Bacon-wrapped shrimp - plump, juicy and accompanied by a sweet, delicate passion fruit mustard and honey.  Foie gras dumplings - musty taste of liver slightly masked by thickness of the wrap and sweetness of figs.  Truffled mashed potatoes - haven't experienced a failed execution of this dish at any restaurant.  Filet mignon - one of the juiciest, well-seasoned cuts of filet I've ever had, even compared to Ruth's Chris.  Bone-in ribeye - had a bite since it was my boyfriend's steak, but tender and perfectly seared.  Glazed market mushrooms - an excellent side to any steak meal.  I could do without the small services of shishito peppers as they did not add much value to my meal.   Overall, one of the top steakhouses to which I have been!",

Fancy place so dress accordingly.I had reservations which we switched due to a conflict in schedule...somehow despite being on phone with them they didn't have our new reservation, but according  to  hostess \"luckily could seat us\". Started off with bottled water, $9 a bottle  actually. Followed by $19 cocktails. Followed by a cold bread basket with 3 types of bread.Cold bread is a pet peeve of mine especially  at a higher end restaurant. Nobody likes cold bread on a cold night especially.  Husband order huge porterhouse steak $73  ,and it came under done and had to go back.He ordered medium,it came very rare.Neighboring table sent back to rare steak as well that they had ordered medium. For these prices that's unacceptable. ...guess chef was having an off night.Fingerling potatoes were good and steak was good when it came back properly cooked.Peppercorn sauce was our pick of the three sauces offered.  I ordered the turkey dinner special since it was turkey day after all. In retrospect the waiter really wasnt trying to sell.the special.I should have heeded <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fthis.To&s=bc09f49ac496e8b9c4d788adb25c1939be8a3d2c1ce3cae9f8226ce562b8b7c7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">this.To</a> my surprise what came was 3 slices of what looked like Jennie  O turkey loaf,(it was tough to cut with a steak knife!)on top of a meager amount of mashed potatoes(  I think it was baby food )with a huge glop of canned  cranberry sauce ,a square of dark meat confit and a square of stuffing(the best tasting part of entire dish),reminiscent of McDonald's  fried hashbrown squares,awful Brussel sprouts ,drizzled with a tiny amount of <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgravy.Im&s=799e9dc6de31a521dc2583a843edff80e41e6b122a5b19b3bb022a59540894c7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">gravy.Im</a> not sure where the best turkey dinner was in Las Vegas on Thanksgiving  day 2015,but Prime takes the cake for one of the worst  I've ever had.I did not finish.

Never have I been to a restaurant that nailed down both ambiance, service, and steak so well. The restaurant is gorgeous, and as picky as I am, I have ZERO complaints about anything. I love that they still require jackets, and bonus points for COMFY seating! The sauces only compliment what is already a perfect steak, and this place has only cemented my love for chef Jean Georges Vongerichten. If I could levy one criticism about this place, it is the fact that they deserve two michelin stars and they have none, which is the fault of the Michelin guide, not this superb dining jewel.",

I had the bone in Filet with the crab mashed potatoes that was the chef's special for the evening.  Both were very good.  I started with an heirloom tomato and mozzarella salad, very good, but hard to mess that up.  Creamed spinach was very boring and lacked flavor. I had to add salt to it & was missing the 'creamed' part of it.  Mashed potatoes were too soupy for me, was like baby food.  But the creamed corn was a definite winner.  Their peppercorn sauce was rather boring for me.    We asked for a table by the window or water so we could watch the Bellagio water show.  We go the furthest thing from it.  Some lady came and asked if we wanted our pictures taken at the table...TACKY...where are we Disneyworld???  They also were over booked or something b/c towards the end of the meal we felt pressured to 'hurry up and go'  like they needed the table.  Very upscale atmosphere, business meeting dinner rather than a date place {stk is a date place}.  see pix of my salad",

    "text": "We ate at Prime this past weekend as we were celebrating our son's 21st birthday in Las Vegas.  We generally try and get in one or two nice dinners when we are in town, so we decided to try this restaurant.   Everything started off well, service was pleasant, had good drinks, and the tuna ribbon appetizer was fantastic.  But, somewhere after we finished our appetizer, the service completely changed for some unknown reason.  While our waters were constantly being filled and our used dishes taken away, our waiter completely disappeared.  I noticed other tables received the nice restaurant \"reveal\" - not for us, we were just given our meals, one by one.  Not a big deal normally, but you notice when your table is treated differently than everyone else's.  We honestly didn't see our waiter again until after we completed our meals and my wife went to the restroom, and then he came over to fold her napkin.  Not a word, not a look, nothing.  He never checked on our food, asked how we were doing, or if we wanted another bottle of wine or drink refills.  I can honestly say I've never been treated like this at any restaurant, much less one where you can expect to pay hundreds of dollars.  I'm not one to make a scene, so I didn't, but when my wife was walking back from the restroom, the manager stopped her to ask how dinner was and she told him about our experience.  He said he would make everything right, and at that point, another server took over our table.  I have to say, for the most part, the food we had was really good.  My son loved his filet, which was prepared perfectly and had great flavor.  I had the sea bass, which was really well prepared also.  My daughter's peppercorn New York strip, unfortunately, was so overdone, it was hard to chew.  Yes, she had ordered it medium well, but this steak was beyond well done.  Unfortunately, again, since our waiter never checked on us, we weren't able to give feedback.  At that point, I should have had it sent back with one of the other servers.  So, the manager, Chris, really did make this right, as best he could.  They brought over three desserts on the house, including one specifically celebrating my son's birthday, they removed my daughter's steak from the bill, and comped our bottle of wine.  Completely and way more than we would ever have expected and we were thankful and grateful for that.  Sandy, the server who took over, couldn't have been more apologetic, helpful and pleasant, and we appreciated that.    It's unfortunate because we came to the restaurant to celebrate a special night.  I'm sure the restaurant is normally great.  Great ambiance, fantastic food, really the perfect setting.  But, our experience was ruined by one bad server.  It's interesting to note, too, that Sonia S's post below occurred from dining the same night we ate at Prime, so not sure if we both had the same server.  In the end, there are so many good restaurants to choose from in Las Vegas that one bad experience like this is enough to make you never come back.",

Most of us ordered the foie gras which was nothing short of spectacular. It was perfectly seared and absolutely delicious.   The steaks were solid, though I've had better in Chicago and elsewhere in Vegas. The sides were amazing, the mac & cheese is very rich and very tasty.

We made reservations for 5:00 and I was disappointed there was no confirmation call or e-mail to say hey your reservation is booked, etc. I had to call and I guess call me crazy, but it's that extra little touch that at least makes you feel special.  On a bright note, my wife and I did get to sit outside on the patio in the nearest table facing the fountain which was an experience to say the very least. It really felt VIP like to sit that close to the fountain and with a sun burn getting the mist from the fountain show upon its completion was an added bonus.  Collectively we had the same problem with our steaks. We both ordered the filet mignon medium and it was more of a how to cook steak diagram. The ends were burnt, the middle was far from medium, and that just didn't cause for a great feeling. We also ordered crab mashed potatoes which were way too buttery and the crunchy potatoes which certainly lived up to that, but that's NOT a good thing. It was too crisp on the outside and mashed in the middle, but the taste honestly just wasn't there.  The worst feeling overall was hearing my wife feel like she didn't belong there. It seemed from the very beginning the staff felt that as well and displayed that all through the meal. It seemed they looked down on us and my wife even said one of them ran to our table after we left just to make sure we paid. REALLY? If I was in the right mindset I would have dealt with that, but honestly Karma is a you know what.  Truth be told they can continue to prepare sub par side orders and wow with a chef who clearly didn't know a medium prepared steak without us. Now drench your house made steak sauce in that Prime!",

The food was exceptional- bacon wrapped shrimp, beet salad, wedge salad, short ribs and garlic soy steak, asparagus, au grautin potatoes plus 1 mojito and 1 cosmo. The flavors of each item were amazing.   So why not 5 stars? We were shoe horned into a corner next to 2 very large parties and the service by our main waiter was lacking. The other waiters  were very attentive.  Would we return- yes after we save up money as this is definitely an over $300 meal for 2 people.",

Definitely not worth the $76. I can at least say the $20 sides were good. Mac n cheese and mashed potatoes. Will never return.",

The service is fantastic and our professional servers were friendly, attentive, and very helpful with the menu. After a couple of masterfully executed cocktails at the bar our group was seated.  John Burke our Sommelier for the evening has an incredible ability to pair wines with everything you are eating weither it be Seafood, Steak, or Salads. He knows just what your palate and especially your soul needs.  I ordered the seafood tower, tomato and mozzarella salad, aged bone in rib eye (medium), and the donut tower. All accompanied by Mr. Burke's selection of several incredible wines. A monumental meal.  Our table of 6 had everything one could desire to eat and drink. The bill, hold your breath.   $2,880 with tip. Worth every hard earned penny.",

The filet was alright (I've had better) and the lobster tail was flat out bland even with the butter sauce. We had a party of five and four of us ordered this meal and neither one of us ate the lobster tail. The waitress was nice and however and removed it from our checks. My dinner alone was $97.00 even with the lobster taken off. So that price is for the filet mignon and the Mac and Cheese (which was really tasty by the way). The wine was good and we were able to take plenty of photos with the water show as our backdrop. The food was just sub par. I've definitely had better.

There's no point in going to this restaurant and paying the upcharge on their steaks that you can get at other steakhouses as the only distinct thing about it is the view of the fountains.  Take a wild guess what happened.  We arrived and were seated in the back of the restaurant.  When I mentioned it to the server, I was told this table was \"just as good.\" Requested to speak to a manager and was assured we would be moved to the first available table with a view. I watched as a table came and went as another party with a later reservation was seated ahead of us.  Be aware: based on observations and if you read the other negative reviews of this restaurant, you'll notice a racial trend about which parties Prime accommodates with views of the Bellagio fountain and which they shove in the back of the restaurant. If you're a POC or appear young, you'll have a very tough time convincing the staff that your request and your money hold just as much value as someone who looks like a 50+ WASP banker from the Hamptons.   Try Cut Steakhouse instead for phenomenal food and service that doesn't discriminate based on age, race, or class.",

My wallet is thankful we only visit once a year, but if you're in the mood to indulge and have a keen palate for steaks and shellfish, the meal is worth every penny (even better than Cut's pricey wagyu over at the Palazzo).

This is MUCH better in both quality and service than Jean George's at ARIA.  I would highly recommend any of the steaks, as well as the mashed potatoes, mixed drinks, rice pilaf, and chocolate cake desert. The seafood was also very good we ordered some of the shrimp wrapped in bacon (highly recommend) and a raw tuna dish (strong flavor, wasn't my favorite).  Two very small improvements I would make would be to add a few vegetarian options, I know it's a steakhouse but we had two vegetarians in our party. And a more affordable/basic section to the wine menu, I think the cheapest glass was $16 and bottles were around $70.  I'd say about $80 a head is what you can expect to spend here, totally worth it!",

It came out piping hot from the oven with melted Gruyere cheese on top(the best part).   My friend got the caviar and she really enjoyed it. 1 oz was plenty for 1 person.  My other friend got the tomato salad. She said the tomatoes came out freezing cold (so just be warned if you have sensitive teeth).  Main entree: 28 oz bone in ribeye (medium).

OVERALL RATING: 5 (SCORED  25 OUT OF 25) STAFF: 5+ (All very friendly and enjoy working) FOOD: 5+ SERVICE: 5 (Multiple people working on your table, not just one waiter/waitress) CLEANNESS: 5 PRICE: 5  This location sits on the water of the Bellagio where you can watch the water show!! An amazing view if you get a window seat. Even better view if you can sit out on the patio. Make sure to make reservations for special occasions and request window or patio. You won't be disappointed.   STAFF: I am a firm believe that if you have a rude front service hostess it can ruin the whole night. I will say that here they greeted you with a smile and was very polite.   FOOD: I am not one that likes to pay high prices for food, normally the more you pay, the smaller the portions and you leave hungry! Not here! You get a good amount of food at a great price!   SERVICE: Multiple people working on your table. All very nice, friendly and attentive. They don't ask what you are drinking over and over.    CLEANNESS: Very clean. Not like some places where someone drops something and they leave it for someone else to pick up or just don't even care. If it is dropped it is picked up immediately and taken care of. Tables are turned quickly, because that equals more $ for them.   PRICE: Dinner was $100 per person and that is with each having a drink. The food was amazing quality and each bite was AMAZING.",

The ambiance of the restaurant was very comforting and the food was very delicious. The only thing that would have made it a great experience was if we had a table by the water. Maybe next time though! I would definitely come here again. I definitely suggest this place, but be prepared to spend some money.",

We got some kind of shrimp appetizer and to honest I probably could have ate them for dinner they were so good... also try a drink called \"cable car\", so good for the ladies (I promise they won't be disappointed).

Drinks costed a fortune $30 for a bourbon and coke, meals cost $70 that's without sides so tack on another $20 for asparagus and $20 more for potatoes. With dinner, drinks and dessert our meal between 4 people was $800! We expected $500 so we were disappointed. Food wasn't worth that. You can see the light show for the Bellagio Fountains which was gorgeous but this high end restaurant just wasn't good enough.",

It was a totaly splurge for my boyfriend's birthday and to compliment the dining experience, I had tickets to Cirque du Soleil's \"O\" after dinner.  The restaurant is hidden, and is the only restaurant at the Bellagio that does not have signage for the restaurant facing the Bellagio pool.  We had to ask hotel staff how to locate the restaurant, as to there not being any signage for the restaurant inside the Bellagio as well.  The restaurant is an experience for all the senses.  The decor is beautiful and I had requested a window seat for my dinner reservation.  You are able to enjoy the Bellagio fountain while dining.    Service is impeccable.  We had a very knowledgeable and gregarious waiter.  It was definitely worth the splurge.  The total bill came out to be over $300 dollars including wine.  We had both ordered filet mignon (I opted for filet mignon with foie gras) and a side of tempura, a side of truffle mashed potatoes, and a side of creamed spinach.  (I can't seem to recall our starters nor dessert.)  It was a great experience and we can't wait to return to Prime.",

I am from the Bay Area, so I know I am spoiled in regards to great restaurants and someone from SF recommended Prime to me...what a huge disappointment.  First of all, the staff person who showed us to our table pulled the chair out for my husband and not me - while HILARIOUS, was a tip-off that the place is \"off.\"  Our waiter was obnoxious - condescending and LOUD voice.  We had a reservation at 6 and tickets for a show at 8 - he seemed uncertain that we would be done on time, which was ridiculous as we were completely rushed through dinner.  He treated us like rubes who just fell off the turnip truck, \"Heard you heard of Alaskan king crab legs?\"  Really.  \"Uhhh, how do you say that word, 'craaa-bbbb?'\"   D'oh - annoying.  We started with a salad, which was fine, very small portion size.  I had a filet - okay, but didn't change my world.  My husband had the lamb.  Fatty.  We split some brussel sprouts and potatoes - again, really unremarkable.  Rushed service and the very loud waiter made it a not-so-fun experience.  $230.00 later, we should've skipped it.  We are foodies.  Prime is not for foodies. On the plus side, elegant decor and nice views of the Bellagio fountains.",

    "text": "So,if you are thinking of eating here but haven't gone to any one of the other acclaimed steakhouses in Las Vegas, I'd highly recommend you go elsewhere.  This place was a disappointment from beginning to end for us.  First thing you need to know is that if you look at the menu, the only place the word prime shows up is in the title.  The steaks are not prime.  And they definitely do not taste like prime steaks.  They may have prime steaks on the menu, but unless it specifically says it is, it ain't.    Secondly, the service here sucks.  No sugar coating here.  I don't want people to make the same mistake I made and eat here when there is definitely much better in this town.  Go elsewhere for good service, or at least average service.  Well, hopefully I've dissuaded you.  If not, or if you just like reading about poor dinners like watching a car accident, read on.    We ordered the crabcakes.  And this is where the problems started.  We dutifully split it in half as usual, I began eating and noted it was good, then I bit into a crab shell.  Wow, that hasn't happened to me at any decent restaurant and I've had my share of crabcakes.  Disappointed but willing to overlook this, I bit into another piece of shell.  I'm paying a pretty decent sum for a crabcake that isn't remarkable in any way, and I'm biting into shells?  Unbelievable.  Next up, the salads.  Except we didn't order salads.  They were for the table next to us.  With some horror I realized that our steaks and another table's salads were on the sam f-ing cart, but they served their salad first!  I don't think they do that kind of thing at a Black Angus, much less a restaurant that claims to be a top steakhouse.  Horrified but willing to ignore the two insults already suffered, we got our steaks and sides after a bit of a pause.    My steak was ok.  18 oz bone-in ribeye.  The sauces weren't special but I'm not much of a sauce guy.  However, if you are going to pride yourself on your sauces, it should generate some interest from me.  Sides were decent.  Truffled mash potatoes were creamy, creamed spinach was what I expected.  I didn't much enjoy the bread though.  I got a pretzel roll that was extremely salty.    And then the final insult.  We finished our steaks, and waited a long time for our waiter to come back, but we didn't see him again.  The second cleaned up and brought us out the dessert menu, but that took quite some time.  At this point I hadn't seen our waiter in so long I assumed he actually left.  I thought that was incredibly rude to do that without turning the table over to someone.  Why are we ordering dessert still?  I wanted to give this place a chance to right the wrongs.  After ordering the crepe suzette (17 layers!), we waited a long time for our dessert.  A real long time.  And after finishing what I thought was a good dessert, we waited a long time for our check.  At this point our waiter returned!  We hadn't seen him since we ordered.  Apparently he had been taking care of another table.  He didn't tell us this, which would have alleviated a lot of the insult I felt by this time.  He cleared our dessert and we wanted no more of this restaurant.  It took a full 15 minutes for him to bring us our checks.  By this point we were angry.  We got here at about 6:45, and it was now 9:15.  So we spent an equal amount of time being seated, ordering and eating as we did waiting on our dessert and paying our check.  I won't be back here when there is so much better in town.",

The reason why I only gave this 3 stars is because my boyfriend (who was the birthday boy) ordered the porterhouse and wanted it medium. He started to eat it and when he got towards the center, it was clearly rare. He continued to just eat the edges, but he barely put a dent in it. He stated that he didn't want to complain, but he was not happy at all that he couldn't even eat his steak. We brought it up to the waiter, which offered to bring out another one. My boyfriend declined since he had a little bit of it, and was not about to try to start eating another one.   With that said, I loved the food. Pricey, but I was prepared to spend $$$$. I wish that my boyfriend could have enjoyed it more but they made up for it. He got a free dessert and he loved everything else, but his porterhouse. Again the service was great, sort of a long wait in between courses, but you have the fountain to watch.",

    "text": "I like a good steak.  This restaurant had decent meat, but they chose to mask it quite heavily with sauces and/or crusts.  If it a quality meat, it should stand on its own.  Sauces and crusts are good, but only a small quantity.  There was just too much. The service seemed good for the other patrons, but not for us.  We were the youngest in the restaurant, or at least the youngest looking, and that is what probably led to our lack of service.  That being said, I was dressed as nice if not better than most with a classic suit and tie.  Passing busboys were of more service than our waiter, who took our order and gave us our check.  I am a decent tipper of at least 20% for average service, so this guy judged us and spent more time with older customers.  Oh well, why dissappoint him with a generous tip.  I did, however, let the manager know that I wanted the tip money to go to the busboys because they did our waiters job.  He offered me a complimentary meal, but I declined.  Why should I have to deal with high prices AND no service.  There are other better steakhouses that I will review shortly that are head over heels better than Prime.",

    "text": "Let me begin by saying this is the most elegant steakhouse I've been to. ( Although CUT is my favorite steak wise ) It is beautifully situated on the lakeside level of the Bellagio hotel. We were seated right by the elegantly draped huge windows that overlook the Bellagio fountain show and smashing chocolate brown and light blue decor.  The posh surroundings are warm, welcoming and yes... romantic.  The staff was very courteous and very knowledgeable on their selections of wine and food.   Although there are many other notable restaurants to choose from at while in Vegas, we didn't want to be late to our cirque de soleil - O show so dining here seemed to be the most practical solution. On to the food..  APPETIZERS  1. Shrimp cocktail  =  Succulent and delicious   2. Butter-Poached King Crab w/ apple-chive Salad & Brioche = How can you possibly go wrong here? Melt in your mouth sensation as soon as it touched a taste bud. The chucks of crab were huge which i would have expected for an almost $30 dollar appetizer. Hehe. Well worth the price. 3. Caesar salad = Your typical Caesar salad with a little twist, the parmesan baked cone. So cheesy!  MAIN COURSE 1. Bone-in Rib Eye Steak 18 oz = We both opted for the same steak and unfortunately I was NOT impressed. The quality of the meat is honestly not worth mentioning.  It wasn't very juicy or marbleized as other steaks I have tried.  Very mediocre, which I was not expecting.. sadly.  I almost forgot to mention that there are three different sauces for the steak that are provided, but for good steak the sauce just gets in the way. Well at least, in my opinion. =) 2. Bone-in Rib Eye Steak 18 oz SIDES 1. Truffle mash potato = Ahhhh, SO GOOD.  I absolutely love anything that has truffle in it!  The flavor will explode in your mouth!  A definite must try for yourself!   2. Mac and Cheese = I tasted white cheddar here.  Rather tasty.  3. Steamed asparagus = Perfectly seasoned, but wasn't cooked enough. OTHERS 1. Grey hound = Refreshing and light.  2. Red Zinfandel = Recommended by our server, GREAT! Not too acidic or dry. Went well with my steak. 3. Red wine =  I forgot this one.   Overall,  the atmosphere is close to perfection, but the food was very mediocre in taste with the exception of the Truffle mash potatoes and appetizers.  Although I was not impressed by the steak, I would return to try the seafood on their menu and the butter king crab again.  One thing I like about Prime is that they cater to their clientele. If something is not to your liking, they will do whatever they can to make sure you are pleased. The staff is exceptionally warm and personable too. Would return, but no steak for me! How ironic to say at a steakhouse..   1 out of 5. 5 being the highest Food - 3 , truffle mash potatoes gets a 4! Ambiance- 4 Service- 4 Price - Total with tip $308.00",

    "text": "Let's just start by saying that Vegas has become an over-priced, over-hyped, self-indulgent toilet of a town, if it wasn't already.  Second, I have never enjoyed any meal I have gotten in Vegas, nor has it been worth the price or crappy service that accompanied it.  Letting that color my view of \"fine\" (and I say that with a grain of salt) Vegas dining, it could be hard for me to put that out of my head.  I had recently eaten at Brand in the Monte Carlo.  So I had a feeling of what was to come.  Let's start with bartenders at the entrance of Prime.  Complete jerks.  Just because I am in my early/mid-20's doesn't mean I am poor or not going to spend beau-coup dollars.  The food is horribly overpriced, but when you are trying to cultivate a \"superior,\" asshole feel to your restaurant, that's okay.  The problem is Las Vegas is miles from any reasonable agricultural area or the ocean.  That raises some flags for me.  Maybe that is why it cost more to eat there, but when you look at craigslist for jobs and homes, you see that cost of living is not insane in the Vegas area, so maybe I can just chalk it up as a \"tourist trap.\" The food was actually okay.  I got a lamb dish that was small, but reasonably cooked and came with a tasty mint sauce.  I also got a side of mac and cheese which was decadent beyond all belief but relatively standard for such an easy dish.  We split one bottle of wine for  our group because the prices were psychotic.  While the list was very voluminous, it wasn't worth paying for half the bottles on there since you were paying well over 150% over store retail.  I have a problem with this restaurant because it is no different from every other crap offering that every casino in Vegas has. The service was average, but our waiter was clearly perturbed with the average age of our table.  We tipped well anyways but we felt like he made a thinly veiled comment regarding our ability to pay and the possibility of us ditching the bill.  That cost him $20 as we left since one of our party, who works in restaurants, had said he never heard such a comment.",

We were celebrating for my friend who was leaving for the navy, i give the ambiance a 4 star and the food a 4 star. everything was pricey but worth every bite. The thing i did not like most was the service! Just because our party was young and we did not order bottle service the waiter decided to ignore us! After we left the restaurant we approaced the person in charge and told them how horrible the service was. all he said was \" what can i do to make it right\" , like all he cared about was giving us comps thinking we were these snooty little rich kids who just wanted to complain. All we said was NOTHING we just wanted to inform you, because our intentions was not to get anything for free we just wanted to inform the person in charge of the horrible waiter... Would I dine again at PRIME? perhaps i really did enjoy their food and Prime Patio is to die for giving you an awesome view of the fountains as you sip on your coffee..",

It arrived way overcooked and had to be sent back. The second attempt was only slightly better. The server was overly gracious and happy to accommodate us. However, I will have to subtract one star because my fiance did not like his filet as much as I did. The sides were standard for high end steakhouses, and the creamed spinach was quite good. The decor and touches are top notch.  You can also view the Bellagio fountains from the side windows. Overall, a great place for a special, romantic occasion.",

I was full 2/3s of the way into the steak but still had to finish.  It was too good to take home. Service is first class.  I've been to plenty of nice restaurants, and this one has some of the best service i've ever had.  Just an unbelievable dinner.

Salads are big enough to share with a blue cheese dressing that felt homemade.  My wife's filet was cooked a perfect medium rare.  She thoroughly enjoyed the 3 side sauces that come with all steaks.  I had the peppercorn steak which was awesome.  A ton of flavor and tasted like a char on the outside but warm and moist on the inside. The sides were also delicious and plentiful.  Truffle mashed is a must have while the Brussels sprouts were also good.  Great wine selection but best part was the availability of wine by the glass.  Although common at most steak houses their list had some great choices.  We had the 2008 silver oak which nice and smooth.  We were so full that dessert was not an option. However to put the cherry on top they brought out a chocolate souffle with ice cream on a beautifully prepared plate. I had forgotten that I included my wife's birthday on the reservation.  Overall this dinner was perfect.  Yes this is not a cheap meal but you definitely get your money's worth!",

The second night wasn't as good as the first night but was still a very good.  Our salads came out so quickly that we hardly had time to enjoy the bread basket, which by the way has some really good pretzel bread and a delicious raisin bread too.   I guess it was a slow night and the kitchen wasn't busy.  I'm not complaining since the food is so good here.   The waiters and bus boys are very efficient.

For dinner my wife ordered the Filet and I ordered the Porterhouse along with some mashed potatoes and some creamed spinach.

Had I been yelping when we first started going there, this would be a 5 star review.  2 times ago, 3 of us went, for my birthday, and noticed the decline in the food.  Still,the service, and having desert and coffee on the Terrace afterwards, with a front row view of the fabulous fountain show more than made up for it.  The last time (2011) when I called to make reservations, I stated that we would like coffee on the Terrace, after dinner.  I was told that you could now have your entire meal on the Terrace!  That was great news, except that you could not reserve a table there, but could take your chances.  Why??  I was calling 2 weeks ahead.  Ultimately, we were seated outdoors, as requested.  Our waiter, Luis, I think,  was RUDE and he and the mini waiters helping him, were slow and inefficient.  Our meals finally came, and my daughter's steak was wrong.  She ordered a medium rare, Kobe filet mignon, and was brought  a dried out, well done, New York.  The waiter was upset, and insisted that was what she had ordered.  The New York had never even been considered, and we told this idiot, when we placed our order, that we were anxious to compare the regular filet that I ordered, to the Kobe filet.  He said the kitchen would be \"mad\" if we sent it back.  We sent it back anyway. Pretty brave on our parts!  It took 1/2 hour to bring what she had actually ordered.  In the meantime, my meal, and our sides, were getting cold, so we ate from my plate.  Our bill was over $400, for 2 people.  I didn't want to raise hell, and spoil what was left of my daughter's birthday dinner, but did email the manger when I got home.  I gave her a detailed description of our experience.  As the manager, she should have appreciated  the polite, constructive and honest feedback.  Her email back said that she was sorry, and was looking into the matter.  She said she did not want to lose us as future guests to Prime, and would I please send my phone number so she could call and discuss the matter further.  I sent my phone number, and never heard from her, again.",

I ordered a Porterhouse and an 8oz. lobster tail.  It wasn't cheap by any means, but by golly was it worth it.  The steak was cooked to perfection, and just as I had ordered it (medium rare).  Many steakhouses and restaurants have the tendency to stray on the conservative side, particularly when it comes to raw meat.  Not this time.  The strip and filet were both delicious, flavorful, and tender, and the medley of sauces they provided only added to the experience.  The lobster tail, well, does lobster tail really need any introduction?  Highly recommended if you want to escape the hubbub of some of the more mainstream dining choices in Vegas; it was a taste of culinary serenity nestled in the middle of a zoo.",

The seafood platter appetizer was delicious, featuring a variety of shrimp, clams, oysters and a huge crab leg and lobster tail.  The bone-in filet was excellent - perfectly cooked and full of flavor.  The lamb was a little less than spectacular, but still good.  Despite being completely full, we had the chocolate cake and lemon tart desserts. Both were exceptional.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I chose to celebrate our 1 year anniversary at Prime Steakhouse at the Bellagio and we are so glad we did. It was wonderful! First and foremost, the food was incredible. After we shared the salmon sashimi as an appetizer, I had the seared tuna and my boyfriend had the filet mignon. Both were tender, juicy and just as we ordered. We also split the family-style side dishes, wild mushrooms and truffle mashed potatoes as sides. I insisted on the mashed potatoes after reading about how great they were on Yelp! and everyone was right - they were even better than anticipated. So creamy with a special 'bite' to them that I find impossible to describe. You really have to taste it to believe it. Drooling as I write... but I digress. Prime has an extensive wine list and the excellent staff even surprised us with a 'happy anniversary' free dessert of lava chocolate cake a la mode. Everything from the ambiance to the service to the food was perfect. The incredibly romantic view of the fountains at the Bellagio which went off frequently throughout our meal made the night even more memorable and special and the waiter didn't even complain when we asked him take a photo of us. We had a hard time getting reservations even calling a month out - we had to choose between 5:30 or 10 p.m. so I recommend making reservations as soon as you know you will be in Las Vegas and celebrating a special evening. This restaurant should be saved for special occasions though as it was a very pricey meal! But if you want to impress, this is the place to come.",

They returned both our steaks, unfortunately they did not replete them on new plates AND they put my steak on her plate and her steak on my plate, we only knew this because we had different sides. VERY amature. Our server could care 'o less...he was probably upset that the wine we ordered wasn't $300 a bottle. I pointed out the error, they were semi-concerned. I didn't really complain, but wasn't too happy. The manager came over and apparently knew what happened, she graciously took both of our meals off the bill. I was appreciative. I would still not go back.",

Pointed out we had a reservation and we were moved to a nice table.  Waiter and his staff were wonderful.  Appetizers - shrimp and salmon sushi were excellent.  Butternut squash soup amazing.  And the dinner - we had salmon, filet and ny steak were all amazing.  Side dishes excellent.  I am knocking this review from a five star to four star solely because of the extreme attitude of the hostess.  Visited many steakhouses of this caliber and never had a hostess with that attitude.",

I ordered the bone in rib eye, which is one of my favorites. i ordered mine medium rare. The first steak was well done. The manager was standing behind me watching me cut it several times and finally asked is something was wrong, so i told him it was overcooked and he brought me out a new steak. Great I thought, then the second one was raw that's where the flashlight came and he looked at it. He brought it back for a refire and guess what this time it was microwaved. A microwave steak for $58 and with a name like prime I could buy a better steak in a grocery store.In between all the steaks I had to ask for another drink which the waiter never brought till I was done eating. I sent it back cause it was sitting there so long there wasn't any ice left in it. the manager took my microwave steak off the bill big deal it still cost me $300, what a waste when there so many good restaurants in Vegas",

Prime is absolutely elegant, great service, great drinks, nice menu.  We started out at the bar so we could get a table with a view. We ordered a lemon drop very good.  Got a table overlooking fountains super. The restaurant really is elegant.   They came out with some delicious bread, my favorite the pretzel bread.  We ordered each the filet for main, and truffle mashed and steamed asparagus. The potatoes were heaven so tasty. The steak although was nice size ordered it medium, both husband and I thought it was bland and not as tender as we expected for 62 dollars. It came with dipping sauces that were good but again the steak to us was bland. That's why the 3 stars. Overall I'd return but try a different steak. I really wanted to love this place it's just soo many steakhouses and we've had a better tasting steak.",

Dinner on again, we had bacon wrapped shrimp, crab cake, ribeye, lamb, cauliflower, potatoes gratin, brussels sprouts, and a souffle.

    "text": "For a romantic dinner with a show, Prime is a primo place for just that type of situation. The restaurant sits right behind the Bellagio fountain show and if you are fortunate enough to get a window seat or sit out in the patio, it can be a very romantic evening. Even if you sit in the middle or back areas of the restaurant, you have a decent chance of seeing the water show as well but just not to its full potential.   The service was simply amazing as most of the fine dining establishments in Las Vegas, however the food is a little hit or miss depending on what you order. AND like most fine dining in Vegas, it is extremely pricey as I had the custom made surf and turf style dish.   The waiter for our evening made some excellent suggestions as far as cuts of meat and even some unique sauces which I tried and were amazed with. Again, service brought Prime up a notch with me otherwise I might not have rated it as high.   Our group ordered the seafood bonanza (not the actual name but that is what it felt like) and it was simply crazy. From crab legs, jumbo shrimp and oysters ... just a hodge podge of seafood. It was good but I am not a fan of most of that stuff except the shrimp.   I was also tempted to have the lobster bisque which I always enjoy at restaurants. The presentation was very nice however the soup itself was way too rich for my taste. Because of that, I didn't finish it which is very rare for me. It should have been toned down quite a bit but the lobster in the soup was very tasty.   I did have the special order of the surf and turf which was a 6oz Kobe beef strip along with a lobster tail. The Kobe beef could have been cut with a spoon and simply melted in my mouth, I was amazed. I did order it medium as I like my meat but it came a little bit under but I didn't care because it just blew me away. The lobster tail was very good but what put it over the top was instead of using the butter, I tried this butter/shallot emulsion and it was amazing as well!!!   Sides are a la carte and I do recommend the spicy mac & cheese. Never made it to dessert but that is ok ... I am stuffed.   Soup: So so  Main Course: AMAZING  Sides: Great   Favorite dish: Kobe beef (medium-rare) with lobster tail in the special sauce (which comes on the side).   Go out and EAT!",

The filet came with the following sauces: peppercorn, soy-rice wine and bearnaise, all of which were carefully explained to us.   Fantastic wine selection. I did not tell the waiter I was there for my birthday until the signed credit card receipt was returned. He immediately said \"please...DO NOT LEAVE YET\" and within a few short minutes I received a complimentary chocolate cake that was delicious. Extremely professional wait staff, great teamwork.   Minor note: there is a photographer walking around taking photos. She was kind of cold and somewhat rude when we said we did not want out picture taken. However, we did understand that was her job. Also, it was kind of awkward but also VERY entertaining to hear all the coaching she gave the people at the next table: \"Give that pretty lady a kiss!\" FLASH \"You are one lucky guy!\" FLASH",

Since it was restaurant week in Vegas when we were in town, I ordered off the special menu to save lots of dollars! But I had to ask for the special restaurant week menu.  I ended up getting the bacon wrapped shrimp, salmon with bok choy and berries for dessert for $50.  My salmon was cooked perfectly and a large portion.  The bread basket had pretzel bread (delish) and a cranberry and french bread.  My husband ordered off the normal menu, he got the 12 oz filet with a side of creamed spinach.  Very good.    Overall, the experience was good. And food was on par to what I expected.  I was not wowed though.  So I probably will not go back since there are many other restaurants on the trip worth trying.",

    "text": "We recently took my parents to Las Vegas for their 37th anniversary. We stayed at the Bellagio, went to see the incredible show O and had dinner at Prime. Mind you my parents do not get out much and this was a special occasion that we wanted to be special and enjoyable. The show was amazing the hotel was beautiful however dinner at Prime was not a good experience to put it politely. My mother's steak came out like shoe leather. My sister ordered the lamb medium well and that came out like shoe leather. The service was just as bad. Once the food was served, the waiter never returned to check on us. We had to catch the show so we were on a time crunch. The next day my mother called the restaurant and explained what happened and they said to leave a name and number and they would check the ticket and get back to her. We are still waiting. We are not complainers but again wanted this special occasion to be a nice experience and the restaurant did not try and correct the situation. The lack of customer service is what is most disappointing, not typical for a nice hotel in Vegas.",

    "text": "What a disappointment! It's too bad that Prime is a big sore spot in what is otherwise a very strong lineup of restaurants at Bellagio.  Unfortunately, we encountered service issues all night. Overall, the waitstaff seemed very slow and inattentive - which is amazing considering how many staff they seem to have just standing around - and I think some of the problems indicate poor management and training. Most noticeable was that we often had to flag down waiters to get our wine and water refilled. The food runners also kept putting food in front of the wrong people - this happened with our appetizers, entrees, and even after-dinner drinks! The most mind-boggling service failure occurred when the runners brought out all appetizers, salads, and soups at the same time, leaving a bunch of appetizers to be chucked in the middle of the table vaguely near the person who ordered them (and only after we told the runners who had ordered what).  Also, I think the way Prime does the table settings and places food could be improved; we were at a larger round table and it felt like waiters were constantly leaning over us to get to stuff nearer the middle of the table - personal space violations abound!  And even given the service problems, Prime's biggest failing was that our steaks were very poorly prepared. Mine was perhaps the worst; they offered a bone-in filet as a special, which I ordered medium rare but came out extreme 'black and blue' - gushing red in the middle while being charred on the outside. Several party members noted they had steaks that were overcooked. The steak was also very, very salty.  Originally, I was going to give +1* because of some solid sides, including the truffle mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese, gnocchi, and Brussels sprouts; also, my tuna ribbons appetizer was tasty, with a nice spicy kick to the accompanying sauce. The problem is, who goes to Prime for appetizers and sides and ignores the steak and bad service? I wouldn't, and even though Prime is closer to a 1.5, that's why I can't in good faith rate any higher than 1*.",

Every 15 minutes or so, you'll get a glimpse of the show and really creates a relaxing, decadent ambiance.  The table service / waiters, for the most part, are professional and up to par in fine dining service.    I've had some outstanding meals here...the best ones included the Seafood Tower which included fresh oysters, gargantuan crab legs, huge prawns/shrimp, and lobster claws - all accompanied with all the dipping sauces.   As for the meal, I go for the New York strip as is my favorite cut, and sides of creamed spinach and mashed potatoes are never-miss choices.  I just love the whole experience from soup to nuts.   A great one to put on your bucket list if you're looking for a high-end steak house while in Vegas.",

I ordered the Soy-Garlic Glazed NY Strip, and the Truffel Mashed Potatoes, and it was amazing. Sometimes you get steaks from restaurants who take so much pride in their steaks, but in my opinion without some type of sauce or glaze, it's just bland to me, I don't care how tender it is. I am a man of FLAVOR...lol. This glaze was soooo good, even after I knew I was full I was determined to finish that steak. There was no way it was going to waste, not one bite. The service was great, the environment calm, chill, and relaxing, very classy. The only thing I wasn't impressed by was the Caesar Salad. I think I had a Caesar Salad every day in Vegas and in my opinion it wasn't as impressive as the steak, not bad, just wasn't impressed.",

    "text": "I got back from a fantastic meal at Prime two nights ago.  A few girlfriends and I were looking to try one of the fine dining restaurants in Vegas, and with so many to choose from, we decided on Prime given its location next to the Bellagio fountains and rave reviews on Yelp.  We started our evening at 8:30 and were a bit befuddled that we had to wait until 8:40 to be seated, despite having reservations and arriving a few minutes early.  This was a minor snag, as the decor and ambiance of Prime quickly trumped that.  Prime is located quite literally next to the Bellagio fountains. Even though we were not seated by the window, our party of four still had a great view. The dining room was dimly lit and featured gold accent moldings and beautiful sweeping windows.  This set the tone for a rich meal, complete with a large variety of wines, good menu variety, and more.  Having waited tables myself, I quickly asked our waiter for recommendations. As a general rule, I've always done this and it has served me WELL. Waiters want you to go home pleased (their tips depend on it), and they know what is popular.  Although they may not say outright if something is bad, they WILL tell you what is very good or perhaps make an alternate suggestion.  Our server began by saying everything was delicious (as you could expect in this type of restaurant), but did point out the menu highlights. Of the list he told us: the truffle mashed potato, the filet mignon steak, one of the steaks served w/ bone, scallop entree, and sole.  We were in the mood for a meal with some punch, so we started with the bacon wrapped shrimp (incredible! One of the highlights of this meal!), and crab cakes to share.  The bacon wrapped shrimp themselves were large and the order came with four shrimp. The bacon and green sauce it came with were lovely; the bacon itself was so hearty and smoky that I didn't think it was possible to have such great, varying flavors in a simple slice of bacon. The shrimp was tender.  Right on.  The crab cake was also excellent and was served atop a type of cabbage slaw and avocado.  Not overly \"crabby\", but great taste and a good size cake to share with maybe one other person.  We were having a hard time picking out wines, being as none in our group could be called a wine expert by any means.  Many a night of Franzia and Barefoot gulping means my pallet was no match for the variety and quality of wines Prime had to offer. Our waiter did a great being patient and recommending some of the cheaper California wines.  In the end, we went with a delicious California Pinot Noir bottle for $75.  Finally, our meal.  Three of us did the Peppercorn New York Steak, which came complete with caramelized red onion and three dipping sauces. The fourth in our party went with the Caramelized Scallops.  We completed this with the acclaimed truffle mashed potatoes (aaahhh-mazing!), creamed spinach, and asparagus.  The steaks were definitely on the spicy side given the peppercorn, but were not overbearing. Our wine, along with the sweetness of the onion and muted, sweeter dipping sauces made the amount of spice just right.  Out of the three sauces, the soy-rice wine stood out as the clear favorite, just as our waiter predicted.  The steak was fresh, cooked to a medium rare perfection, and delicious.  The peppercorn rub was mouth watering and spiced just right.  Amazingly, the scallop dish was the most memorable of the entrees. It was served in an amazing caramelized sauce that was so good I found myself mooching sauce to dip my bread in. (Sorry, Shayna.  I've done worse.) ;P This might be my next dish here.  The truffle mashed potatoes were also delicious, as was the creamed spinach.  Of the two sides, however, the truffle mash was definitely more appetizing. The potatoes were creamy, and literally melted in your mouth.  My mouth is watering just remembering them.  Since we were celebrating a birthday, our server was kind enough to bring out a delicious chocolate cake free of charge as we waited for our check.   Here, service was a bit slow, and we had to ask a busser for assistance on more than one occasion in order to make an 11:00 show. We quickly realized this was because our waiter was preparing the cake, but I also noticed he was assigned seating on the opposite side of the dining room. Having served myself, I know how bad it sucks to be serving a fine 3 course meal with tables in opposite directions, or simply having too many. This is a potential area for improvement, however, our waiter was very kind and patient with us as we took forever to order, so perhaps we also had a part in this.  I will admit, we took forever to order.  Overall, this was an exquisite meal and made for a wonderful night out for our friends. Be prepared to drop some cash here-with wine, sides, and appetizers, our meal came out to $125 a person, not including gratuity. I highly recommend Prime for any special occasion or a night on the town.  Well done.",

My daughter 6 years of age but a very refined young lady enjoyed the butternut squash soup with oysters, my 1 year old couldn't get enough as well. I enjoyed the foie gras appetizer it was melt in your mouth marvelous.  The waiters couldn't believe how well behaved my children are, it's because I myself own a restaurant and I teach them proper table etiquette.    One of my friends ordered the porterhouse in his words the steak was a 10. Other friend ordered the filet he said it was the most tender cut he ever had. We opted for the baked potatoes  Our sides were Fingerling potatoes that wasn't so wonderfully, neither was the creamed spinach  The Brussels sprouts were on point and perfect As we're the Yukon gold mashed potatoes.  My daughter enjoyed the sea scallops while the wife said the lamb chops were the most tender she has ever had. I loved my dry aged bone in ribeye.  All in all a spectacular meal, at a very upscale restaurant.  Not cheap at all. If saving a buck or two is what you are looking for, you will not find that here. The bill was 577.00 I had a 400 dollar resort credit from M-life so my friends covered the 177 and I covered the 140 dollar tip. Well worth it, resort credit or not. We will be back.",

The $200 filet came out, and it was worth every penny. The BEST filet I have or ever will have eaten in my life. I've been to some of the best steakhouses and this without a doubt was worth the $200. For me it was a once in a lifetime, unless someone else is paying next time. Melted in my mouth and had flavor for DAYS!   The sides were mac n cheese and scalloped potatoes.

Our waiters (yes we had a two!) treated us very well.  We had the tomato and burrata salad, fresh oysters, 10 oz. fillets, broccoli and cheddar side and mushrooms side.  All were excellent.  I loved the attention we received, the ambiance, the food and the general vibe in this restaurant.  It is a VERY classy and old-school restaurant.  You can spend a large amount of money here but it definitely feels worth it.      I booked the reservation through the Bellagio and mentioned that it was a birthday dinner.  The servers gave my dad a beautiful complimentary dessert at the end of our meal.  It is so nice to spend time at an establishment that makes you feel special and valued.  My dad is hard to please and yet he made the comment that the dinner was the highlight of the trip (more so than Nobu, the Brooks and Dunn concert or GR Steak).  He also said the fillet was the best he's ever had....and he's had ALOT of steaks in his life.  It made me so happy to know that I was treating him to a dinner that he truly loved and will remember forever.  I will absolutely be back.",

He did have to ask about the dairy free ice cream for the chocolate cake...   Knowledgeable friendly staff.. they also have a photographer going table to table asking if you want pictures. Not once was the conversation my dinner mate and I were having interrupted. At one point a bus boy or someone that hadn't approched us the entire time came to the table and gave me more water. The waiter was a little confused about it too and asked how our meal was and if we needed anything. Everything was great and look forward to going back.",

The onion rings, mashed potatoes, brussel sprouts, and mushrooms were all fantastic. The steak was just as I remembered, especially the miso one. I really appreciate them getting back to me about my first experience, and would happily recommend Prime to family and friends in the future.",

I never felt so ignored at a steak house before.  Other places they are attentive and ready to assist, not this place.  I kept having to flag people down.  The food was decent, I ordered a tomato salad and seabass instead of a filet.  I felt for a tomato salad it was really lacking on the tomatoes.  It seemed like 1 1/2 small round tomatoes.  Could I at least get the other half of the second tomato for that price? Fresh cheese and the seabass's sauce was tasty.  Would I go back even if it had better service the next time around? No.",

I am from LA and used to high-priced dining, but this place was unbelievable.  They did not have any affordable wines on the menu, and the prices for steak were unbelievable.  $65 for a filet that arrived well over-cooked and very bland.  The wines were very overpriced, and the side dishes were pedestrian and incredibly expensive.    I have been to many of the Bellagio restaurants, and expect it to be expensive, but the others are much better than Prime.  Even though Picasso and Cirque are expensive, they are great.  Prime was average in terms of the food, decor, and service, but incredibly expensive.  I would avoid it.",

I ordered the Porterhouse medium-medium well and it came with a trio of sauces for dipping. I was not impressed with the steak, again I would say above average at most. I did like the soy based dipping sauce but it almost overpowered the natural flavor of the steak. So with that said, I could of used practically any meat and dipped it into that sauce and it would probably taste the same. I didn't care much for the other sauces including the bearnaise. (bearnaise, usually is my preferred sauce with a steak)  On the other hand, their Truffle Mash Potatoes.. I must say is impeccable! The texture was on point and the amount of actual truffles (not truffle oil) is right on the money. I'd take this over the steak!  As far as the decor, I must say this place is very upscale. Try getting a window seat, its got a great view of the water/fountains.",

My friend, who was traveling with me, arrived without his bag. They said it would be around 10 that night before he got it. The big problem - my friend only had shorts. The restaurant had a \"no shorts\" policy. I called the reservation line and asked if they would make an exception - NO. I went directly to the restaurant and asked if they would make an exception - NO. I understand policies. I have them in my business. My deal on policies is that, if circumstances dictate, I make exceptions. This is not the theory for Prime Steakhouse. At least for us, it wasn't.   I saw many of the patrons of Prime later that night. I have to say I couldn't effectively gauge the dress code. There were hookers with body parts spilling out of all parts of their dresses (that's using the term \"dress\" liberally). There were men in ripped jeans (which they said they had a policy against) but I guess when you pay $400 for ripped jeans, it doesn't count. Shorts are not okay but T-shirts are???   I wish I could tell you about Prime, but their inane adherence to selective policies prevents me.",

I went for a birthday dinner in a group of 5, made reservations, and we were seated as soon as we arrived. We probably weren't as dressed up as we could have been, but we were all presentable, and there were no issues. The table ordered a variety of things from appetizers through dessert: the french onion soup, wedge salad, filet mignon, ribeye, chicken, salmon, loaded baked potato, asparagus, lava cake, and more! We also enjoyed cocktails beforehand, and even those were noteworthy. The service was impeccable, with water refilled as needed throughout the night, without ever having to ask. They timed letting us get settled, ordering drinks, followed by appetizers, meals and desserts perfectly. I am definitely going back the next time I'm in Vegas, and would recommend this to anyone looking for a beautiful restaurant, delicious meal, and flawless service to round out your night!",

Here is what gave the push to 5 stars from me.  Hardly anyone knows how to make a filet well done without giving  a disclaimer, then burning it to crisp, or keeping it pink/red inside.  It is a True and skillfull chef who is able to cook a filet well done without having to excuse it by adding a disclaimer or begging the patrons to have it be butterflied.  Will go there again. And again. And again.  * I just want to add that I was not allowed to each chocolate cake (I'm a dog, after all ) but those with me did - and they enjoyed!*",

It was served with three sauces that I didn't try because a great steak shouldn't need a sauce. Our sides were macaroni and fries. The macaroni was delicious but the fries were just average everyday boring fries. Service was great. I understand that the restaurant is classy and upscale but I'm pretty sure this is one of the last few that doesn't allow shorts, nice shorts, not talking cutoffs or cargos here....but jeans are acceptable, strange to me. My poor husband had to borrow a pair of their pants which they have on hand because apparently it's a common issue and even stranger he had to walk through the entire restaurant in his shorts to get to the restroom to change.

Still ok, but certainly not $70 steaks.  I've had better at Ruth's Chris, and I'm not really a Ruth's Chris fan.  The truffled mashed potatoes were incredible, but they were $14 for a little side.  I asked the waiter why there were only 2 steaks on the menu that were dry aged, and he tried to tell me that wet aged was just as good as dry aged.  Overall the service was cool, and I loved the ambiance - probably the most impressive ever. But I don't think I'll be going back.",

I know you will, I know you will at PRIME STEAKHOUSE! - Lana Del Rey (young and beautiful)  Honestly if I wasn't able to secure an outdoor patio table, I wouldn't have eaten here. The view was a very big draw for us so I'm happy it worked out.  Pros: -as expected, the view is spectacular -it's not as hot as you think, the slight breeze from the water helps -the bread and caesar salad was very good -great picture opportunities  Cons: -they only had one main server (with many sous servers) to take orders and give out the checks for the entire patio area of like 9 tables (we had 2 hours set aside for dinner before the show and we ended up being a little late) -if you don't order a steak here, don't expect much as the seafood is just average here -dress code somewhat enforced, might be inconvenient for people walking around in the crazy summer heat all day wearing shorts  Overall, I did have a good time with a few hiccups in terms of service but my steak + foie gras was good so I was happy. It's a good experience to try once but with so many steakhouses in LV, this is a one and done for me.",

Toqued by Rob Moore, whose brief departure to open JG Steakhouse at Aria has seen it too grow into a place held in good regard,  it was at a two-top big enough for four that my friend and I were seated, the Bellagio water show visible through large windows to the right while the draped dining room decorated in fine art soon filled to capacity at our left.  Served by a team of at least six, Sommelier John Burke entertaining us with stories from Steve Wynn's reign as well as those of bottles sold in excess of $60K, it was in a four course meal that two-hours was spent talking, the ingredient sourcing, portions, and preparations all justifying prices that may turn many diners away.  Far more classical than Carnevino or Ramsay and certainly more elegant than Delmonico or CUT, the evening began with bubbles alongside a basket of bread and making quick work of salty pretzel batons as well as a nutty raisin loaf it would not be long before a starter of seared foie gras was presented, the acidic sauce of rhubarb perhaps the most interesting steakhouse pairing seen to this moment while shaved almonds worked wonders to meld flavors of fruit to the unctuous liver of duck.  Told that soups and salads at PRIME are far more fanciful that the typical broth or wedge, round two consisted of heirloom tomatoes dressed in milky burrata atop vinegar splashed arugula plus a truly inspired bowl of French Onion, the blend of cheeses lightly toasted atop a crispy brioche float while the potage beneath was beefy enough to be noticed, though the bulk of the flavor came from the caramelized namesake ingredient itself.  No doubt a place with more than just beef to offer, though the options for steaks are plentiful without going overboard on information about sourcing from several different farms, it was in the 18oz Dry Aged Bone-In Rib Eye cooked medium rare that $71 was invested, the quality of the product allowed to show for itself while the menu's cheapest protein shined even more brightly, the pounded half-chicken fried textbook crisp beneath a Parmesan crust as sides and sauces each proved every bit as compelling, the Soy Rice Wine and Comte Potatoes each well deserving of their server-suggested clout.  Unable to resist desserts, the menu's only service error occurring when Jean-Georges' signature molten cake was served in place of the souffle selection of the trio, suffice it to say that as good as each item was there is no doubt that those with an eye for the dramatic will be wowed by cinnamon bread pudding, the tableside saucing seeing a dome of cocoa melted into the custard soaked base as notes sweet, spiced, and salty all dance on the palate.  Trending a bit more pricey than other Steakhouses on the Strip, and somewhat limited by offering only two breeds of beef with fish and seafood not really venturing too far outside the box, PRIME is undoubtedly a place worth visiting for those looking for a 'fine dining steakhouse,' particularly those averse to loud music or looking for a more romantic night out.",

It really wasn't the hostess who told us that the reservation we made for a waterfront view wasn't available that we could have a drink at the bar while we wait, but it was a very unpleasant server named brandon. We were sat and a second later he comes up and puts my menu on my fork in a very unfriendly manner. Coming from the food and beverage industry, I instantly knew this was unprofessional, as he almost did the same thing to my boyfriend I caught the menu. I tried to brush it off, ordered our food, but as I looked at a couple being sat he handed the menu to the lady and same to the man with a smile, I instantly felt SO offended, my heart started to pound and my eyes started to water with anger. My Excitement was over. Although we had just ordered our food, I felt the urge to leave and wish I would've listened to my instinct. My boyfriend talked me Into staying since it was an early valentines celebration. brandon made these disgusting noises from his nose saying \"excuse me there must be something in the air\" but he kept making those disgusting noises every time he was around. His energy was rude. I ordered the filet mignon and ribeye medium rare, horrible. Truffle mashed potatoes, disgusting. Tomato soup, okay, crab cake salty, bacon wrapped shrimp, boyfriend liked it, seafood salad a little on the rubbery side. Chocolate cake was good. NOTHING about this place was what I imagined it to be. VERY Disappointing. I feel super cheated... If it wasn't for the server assistants, this poor excuse for a \"server\" wouldn't have gotten a tip.",

    "text": "Prime is a great steakhouse.  The view of the water show at the Bellagio is fantastic, should you opt for the outdoor seating.  The steaks are wonderful, as was the Seafood Shellfish to share amongst the non-selfish :) - - clams, mussels, oysters, shrimp, crab and lobster  The service is good as well.  I had the bone-in-fillet mignon, which was perfect!  This can be what I'd say one of the better ambient sort of romantic steakhouses in Las Vegas, a good place for a meat eating date.  The prices are of course higher than your typical meat and potatoes restaurant, but if you're accustomed to paying $50-80 for a steak, this is a good place.  The avg meal after tax/tip with a drink or appetizer should set you back about $150 per person at minimum, and once you add bottles of wine and the high end appetizers you're closer to $200-250+ per person to do it the right decadent way not holding back and just having a good time... YOLO !!!",

    "text": "This was one of those dining experiences when I knew from the time I was greeted that it was going to be a special dinner.  I made reservations as a Yelp friend had recommended well in advance of the date I wanted.  I had a ticket to see 'O' at 7:30 and this was one of the Bellagio restaurants that I never went to and also one that opens at 5 giving me plenty of time to enjoy dinner and not worry about making the show on time.  I was seated promptly after a few parties ahead of me.  I was taken to a side room in the front--not one of the coveted center tables directly overlooking the fountains--but it was a really nice room and I could see much of the fountain show in any case.  My servers were Team #18.  I'm not sure if the waiter gave me his name or not.  If he did, I missed it.  He asked about drinks, gave me the menu, and explained some of the things on the menu.  I was also brought a nice selection of bread and some butter.  The bread had been warmed nicely.  I started with the tomato gazpacho.  The bowl had several groupings of avocado, celery, some peanuts and other goodies.  Onto this vegetable grouping, the server poured the cold gazpacho.  He then ground some fresh pepper on the soup and I was off enjoying the first course.  For the main course, I got the 14 ounce filet with bone in cooked barely--blue.  It was accompanied by two shishito peppers.  I also got a side of gratin dauphinois with Comte, a gussied up name for potatoes au gratin.  When I saw Comte, I knew this was it.  It's the kind of cheese I always buy for eating at home.  The steak was done exactly the way I like.  The potatoes were excellent.  A very pleasant side dish that I almost finished.  With the steak, the waiter brought a platter with three sauces, peppercorn, a classic Bearnaise, and their house soy, rice wine sauce.  Of the three, I liked the soy, rice wine the best but I used it sparingly.  I'm generally a purist when it comes to steak.  It really doesn't need a sauce.  For dessert, I got the coconut souffle with chocolate sorbet.  The plating was beautiful.  The souffle was perfect and the round of sorbet on a small bed of toasted coconut was a perfect accompaniment.    Now as to service--it couldn't have been better.  It was top notch.  The server was a friendly gentleman and the bus person was quite efficient.  I had a fresh glass of iced tea before I finished the first one.  The plates were cleared promptly and when my server said the souffle would only take 7 minutes, he was correct.  The maitre d'hotel came around twice during the meal to check how things were and we chatted for a bit.  It was a grand meal and I'll be returning.  This would be a great anniversary dinner.  I think I'll make the reservation soon!",

After a few min, I asked to speak to the manager. He informed me that the reason for the delay was that they had lost the use of the tables that they normally use outside on this particular evening. It's February, the temps this week have been in the 30's and 40's all week. It's now snowing for the third time this month. What a completely lame excuse to use. But it gets better. When we were led to our table, it's two tables of 6, on the back wall of the restaurant, bench wall on one side and 24 inches between the two tables. We were essentially two tables! I had to get up and move to the other table to engage with my other clients. It was ridiculous. Not once did the manager ever come to check on me. It was embarrassing how poorly this was managed. I spent 3100.00 for our dinner and would never recommend this restaurant for entertaining a larger group of top customers. So much goes into the preparation of such a gathering and for the manager to obfuscate such a key component of creating an experience for such a large group is unforgivable. We have been in town for four days. I would highly recommend the three other restaurants who delivered on my expectations flawlessly. Momofuko, STK and SW Steakhouse.",

To his credit, the waiter promptly brought me a new filet that was delicious, but everyone at the table noticed how it was obviously quite a bit smaller than the original one I received. The $17 bakes potato was unbelievably subpar. It was bland and poorly baked and way too expensive. The waiter was ok, but he wasn't special in any way. The service was slow.

We were lucky and got a table with a fantastic view of the Bellagio fountains.   Service could not have been better. Our service team was attentive but not annoying. Everything was timed perfectly, dishes cleared properly, etc.   I started with the black and blue martini. Gin and blue cheese stuffed olives with a sprig of rosemary. It was good but the rosemary was overpowering. Gin is so aromatic already, I felt like it was ruined with the rosemary. I quickly pulled it out and enjoyed the rest.   They bring out a complimentary bread basket. Pretty basic with two types of bread and regular butter. Nothing special.   For my appetizers I had the bacon wrapped shrimp. They were absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection. I also had a wedge salad. It was good but pretty standard as far as wedge salads go. I have had better.   The steak that I ordered was great. New York strip medium rare. It was done perfectly and had great flavor. You can choose peppercorn or some type of glaze on your steak. I chose peppercorn but should have ordered it plain. They bring out three kinds of sauces with the steaks, so it's probably better to try the steak plain and add sauce on your own. It didn't disappoint though.   For sides I had baby brussels sprouts with pear and bacon (a special that night) and also had potatoes gratin. Delicious!!   Dessert was a very slight let down. I had the pumpkin creme brulee. It was more like pumkinless creme brulee but still good as far as a creme brulee goes.   They have nice restrooms within the restaurant. Anyone familiar with Las Vegas restaurants knows that having restrooms within the restaurant itself is a treat. They also provide Molton Brown soap and lotion. Nice touch!   I will definitely return to Prime at Bellagio.   Enjoy!",

I ended up splitting mine with a buddy who made the horrid decision of going to a steakhouse and ordering the salmon (whoops), but still left full.  The menu offers a wide selection of cuts, including A-5 Wagyu at $45/ounce, and a huge selection of sides (truffle mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, Glazed Mushrooms) that round out your meal nicely.

    "text": "I have eaten at many excellent steakhouses in my life, this place is easily as good as any I have ever been to. This includes Ruth's Chris, Mortons, El Gaucho, Ringside, and Alexanders.  The food is great, the service is never in the way but flawless and attentive. This is an extremely busy restaurant but you always feel like your server serves you alone.  I have never had BETTER service.  Then there is the treat, the fact that the steakhouse faces Lake Bellagio and you have a perfect view of the Bellagio Fountain show every fifteen minutes during primetime.  This place is my new favorite fine dining establishment in Vegas. That is saying something because Vegas has a truly diverse and excellent selection of fine dining establishments but the combination of view, food and unbelievably smooth service cannot be beat for any price.  Price by the way is the only downside. This place is extremely high end, which means it costs a large amount of money, I will not call it expensive because I believe it is a very good value.",

We server seemed frazzled and uneducated on the menu.   My meal was good. I had the garlic and soy glazed steak. It was slightly overcooked- more of a medium than medium rare and VERY heavy/strong in the soy. The truffle mashed potatoes were delicious. The best side out of the ones we ordered. (Brussel Sprouts, Mac & Cheese, and mushrooms)   The views of the fountain are fantastic- depending on where they seat you. Unfortunately they did not dim the lights or sync the fountain music with the music in the restaurant, like they do at Disney.   The best part of the meal was dessert. The only reason I would return to Prime. The Donut Fountain is SO GOOD! It was 5 or 6 mini donuts, all different flavors, but our server didn't explain the differences- with a Carmel and chocolate sauce for dipping. SO GOOD y'all!",

The waiter's demeanor changed after I asked if I could just get an appetizer as an entree because I wanted to also order a side dish and dessert. The bus person actually was more pleasant and talked more to me than the waiter.    Food was great, but the service from both gentlemen left me with no desire to visit this place again.  I've visited other restaurants at the Bellagio and the others have always exceeded my expectations but this one was a disappointment.",

While taking our semi-annual trip to Vegas and staying at our normal stomping grounds, the Bellagio, we made reservations for Prime for our Christmas Eve dinner.  I really want to come back when it's warmer so we can sit outside RIGHTNEXT to the fountains and enjoy a breathtaking view with our meal.  Like most upscale restaurants, you need to bring your own flashlight...or in the 21st century, as our table neighbors did, take out your phone and turn its flashlight on to see the menu.  Located below the Bellagio (just take the escalators down) past HYDE towards the shops.  You'll immediately be met by the hostess who will take your name.  There's a corridor that has benches that leads to the bathrooms for people to wait.  Behind the hostess are the double doors that lead to the outdoor seating next to the fountains.  If you so choose, you can walk right into the restaurant and the bar is immediately to your right.  Yay for bars because they were playing the football game my stepdad and I were betting on.  Whoda thunk that this schwanky restaurant would be playing fooseball on the boob tube?  Thankfully, being raised all over the world, I am accustomed to certain dining etiquette...and thankfully so.  At restaurants like these, my heart aches for those who have no idea what they're doing.  Some quick studies:  please do not wear denim please do not wear tennis shoes or flip flops please, gentlemen, at least wear a collared or button-up shirt with slacks please, ladies, wear at least a nice blouse and a nice skirt or slacks allow your host to push your chair in for you allow your server to place your napkin in your lap be prepared to have your server remove certain glasses if you won't be having wine/coffee like you see in the movies/on TV, use your utensils from the outside in  The food was stellar, while amazingly expensive (Vegas).  Our server was well-mannered and civil.  I always feel, though, that employees of restaurants like these look down on us \"regular folk\".  I tried to pay it no mind.  Regardless, the food was delicious, the service was good, and it was an overall pleasing experience.  Will I be back?  Not if it's my decision, but if someone else in my party wants to dine here, sure.",

Service is as to be expected- phenomenal. We forgot our credit card on the table in the end, and the host chased us down (we had already left) to return it. Much appreciated! Fountain view from outdoor seating.   Cons: the outdoor seating is not comfortable. Would be nice if they invest in their outdoor area at least a fraction of what they did to the inside.

Make sure you book a reservation in advance if you would like to dine here. This is my second dining experience and the service is very good along with the food!! Appetizers:  Raw oysters-10 !!! Super sweet and fresh- make your own Cajun style sauce with the cocktail sauce, lemon juice, horse radish.  Shrimp cocktails: 8/10- plump and meaty. Nothing that sets it apart but very good  Fois gra:8/10 rich and buttery/ nice to have a restaurant who knows how to sear fois gra properly. My expectations of fois gra is similar to the restaurants in France so I am a bit tough with this.  Entrees: Colorado lamb chops: 8/10 , nothing mind blowing but cooked medium rare. The flavors are ok. Needs a bit of salt and mint jelly. It was prepared with some weird looking breading... what?!! You just ruined the lamb being the star of the plate!  Filet mignon: 9/10,'prepared just as requested medium rare , and flavorful/ juicy. Ribeye bone in- very tasty but our friends who ordered this could not finish their meal. Definitely a dish to share.  Beet salad: 5/10 skip this. Look at the picture and you will agree.  Chilean sea bass- 9/10 super great!!!! I was a skeptic ordering fish at a steakhouse but very glad that I did.  Side dishes: Maiitake mushrooms: very earthy and flavorful. Truffle mash potatoes- better than the garlic mash potatoes. Mash potatoes- ok Broccoli- nothing special Mac n cheese- not difficult and tough to screw up this dish.  We were too full to even look at dessert.  The server was gracious and brought out a page of truffles for our guest in honor who celebrated a birthday!!",

We were one of the last reservations of the evening, attending after a show.  A fountain view was requested & there were tables that could have accommodated a party of 2 but sadly we were seated in the back.   Beware the menu!  My friend is deathly allergic.  Most menus would call out that there is cilantro on an appetizer or peppers on an entree.  He ordered the ribbons of tuna.  Luckily I eat tuna appetizers all the time & had the foresight to ask if it had cilantro as most do.  Of course, this did & they were able to remove it.   The grilled Lamb Chops are a Greek play on lamb chops.  The feta when tasted by itself was too whipped to have any flavor.  For a palate that doesn't like heat or spice, make sure to ask if it is still being served w/any type of pepper not like red or green pepper but like fresno peppers.  Who serves lamb chops well done?    Given as mentioned, we were 1 of the last 3 tables seated & from our vantage point, could see the wait staff having the closing meeting for the evening service, service was hard to come by to try.  The positive item related to the service was our server noted the beautifully plated lamb chops had been barely touched & asked if I enjoyed them I said no & the bill arrived w/no lamp chops.  My friend had the Dry Aged Ribeye steak & being from New Orleans said it was fine.  Overall, not the decadent dining experience to end our trip on that was expected :(",

Its price lives up to its location, but the food isn't nearly as memorable as the setting.  I came here for a family meal Thanksgiving week and had a great - if not quite outstanding - experience. The wait staff were knowledgeable and attentive, making recommendations when prompted.   The starters were the star of the night, with large and tasty oysters and the most delicious horseradish I've ever tasted. The French Onion soup was also delicious, topped with plenty of chewy cheese. The Cesar salad, though, was forgettable, which is a shame.  For mains I went for the filet, which was cooked perfectly medium rare, tender with a good crust. We shared a handful of mains including an ultra rich potato dauphinoise - one of my favorite dishes, so no complaints there!  All in all it was a great meal, but for the price and location you may come away feeling like it wasn't quite as good as you anticipated.",

The only reason why we didn't send it back it's cuz we had a show scheduled and we would've been late if waited for new steaks . When you paying $100 for a steak you expect a GOOD STEAK.

Nice size shrimp and she enjoyed it. For her main she had the truffle crusted salmon which I thought was absolutely delicious. Amazing how they put that together. Perfect amount of truffle. The sides I didn't generally care for. We had the steamed asparagus and the truffle mashed potatoes which I thought were good but weren't the consistency of mashed potatoes I am used to. No fluff to them whatsoever. Aside from that this is a 5 star place. Very expensive but worth the price tag.",

    "text": "Prime. (5 stars).  \"Prime: of the best possible quality; excellent.\" - Google  \"Opulence: great wealth or luxuriousness.\" - Google  These 2 words go hand I hand when describing the feast & service u will enjoy at Prime Steakhouse in the Bellagio.  ---  I have been to Prime 7 times (6 of which were really pre-Yelp days) & each visit has been more enjoyable than the last.  If ur willing to spend a little more to have a phenomenal Certified A5 Kobe Beef Steak, then u have come to the right place!!  Why do I say that, because Prime's \"non-Kobe\" steaks, while tender, are in line with most other notable Steakhouses, & I can't say there is much of a difference, aside from the beautiful ambiance!  Kobe Beef really is the game-changer!!  ---  On one of my previous visits, my server told me that Partner Chef Jean-Georges VONGERICHTEN, who also owns Jean-Georges Steakhouse in CityCenter, is authorized to serve Certified A5 Kobe Beef. He told me that Prime uses the same supplier as JGS which is why Prime can say they also serve Kobe Beef.  Now I don't know if all of that is True, I just know the Kobe steaks at Prime have been tender, savory, & exquisite!  ---  We ordered so many different items off the menu that we had to play \"Tetris\" with all ur dishes.  I felt bad that I took over the ordering, but I really wanted my friends to just enjoy the evening!!  I did finally get to try caviar! Russian Sturgeon Eggs were $195/oz. Honestly, I'm not exactly sure what I thought they would taste like??!! Perhaps fishy or briny??  But no, they just tasted like muted Tobiko (flying fish roe). I enjoyed the light crunch but can't say I have a refined enough of a palate to understand this delicacy...  ---  Instead of rating every dish, I'll highlight my two favorites:  Certified A5 Kobe Beef (Ribeye) - $55/oz. (5 stars).  \"Wagyu refers to any cattle that is bred in Japan or the Japanese-style. Kobe beef is comprised of a very particular strain of Wagyu called Tajima-Gyu that is raised to strict standards in the prefecture of Hyogo. (Hyogo's capital city is Kobe, thus the name).\" - <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mychicagosteak.com%2Fsteak-university%2F2016%2F05%2F10%2Fwagyu-kobe-beef-difference%2F&s=34c6cdeb5537ede0e13709935f36c381eb60673bc484ce0264806aecca72839c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">mychicagosteak.com/steak...</a>  No, ur eyes aren't playing tricks on u.  Yes, our Ribeye was from Hyogo prefecture.  Prime charges $55/oz. Our ribeye was a behemoth of a steak weighing in at 20oz!  Note: U can pick any weight u want.  What makes Kobe Beef so coveted & sought-after is its marbling, flavor, & tenderness.  The seasoning of butter & S&P was spot on! Each slice was tender & bursting with flavor.  The shishito & bell peppers also absorbed all of the savory juices which made them... MINE!! ALL MINE!! LOL... I have to say I absolutely loved the peppers as well. Slightly crunchy & oh so divine!!  The Ribeye was marbled, fatty, & juicy!! My steak melted upon impact with my tongue. Ohhhh... Emmmmm... Geeeee!!  I'm sure the company had a huge influence on my outlook, but nonetheless, the best steak I have ever had. PERIOD!  Note: U can order a Kobe sampler which comes with 9oz (total) of NY, Ribeye, & Filet or u can mix & match which cut u prefer. Kobe sampler - $495/9oz. I have tried the sampler twice & decided I just enjoy the Ribeye!!  Sauteed Sea Scallops - $47. (5 stars).  I caved in & decided to get an order of sea scallops because I had a wicked bad craving for these succulent & buttery mollusks!!  OK, OK, Rod U., in this instance, the scallops were just as delicious as Maine's!! I can admit it.  This dish actually comes with a black bean sauce that I didn't even need or notice!? I am extremely glad that our server didn't pour the sauce into this dish as I think it would have ruined it (for me).  These scallops were seared to perfection. A light crispy outer crust was noted & greatly appreciated.  Biting into a perfectly cooked scallop is like biting into a marshmallow to me, as far as texture is concerned.  Prime's scallop had a succulent & buttery bite that was just chewy enough to know that the scallops were cooked through, but not rubbery, which would indicate the scallop was beyond over-cooked.  The baby bok choy were tender & seasoned perfectly with S&P & butter. It made me feel healthy for eating something green!  ---  For those who plan to use ur MLife Comps, just remember, the gratuity is NOT included in ur final bill.  Nor can u use ur excess MLife comps to pay ur tip. Shucks. LOL JK!!  Only cash or room charges (credit cards) are accepted as forms of tip.  ---  Although I never rate service, I have to say, the service I have been given every single time I have dined at Prime has been phenomenal!  The servers are very knowledgeable & personable. They cater to ur every need or want!  Luxury, Quality, & Service are what is to be expected when dining at Prime.  I still think Prime should change their name to Opulence!! Prime is my current meat-lover's dream come True & I don't have to travel abroad to enjoy Prime!!",

    "text": "I had such a high expectation from this steakhouse knowing that it was located in the Bellagio and is known for their gardens and water fountains. This casino has one of the most popular tourism out of all MGM properties. My experience here was disappointing.   The minute we got seated, the noise level was insane. Definitely did not coincide with how settle the lights and decor were meant for diners to enjoy their meals along with a view of the fountains. The guests next to us were chatting with another guest from another table about how cool it is having a \"southern accent\". I could exactly give you their whole convo because they were so rude, loud, and those people seemed trashy to be honest. Those guests lacked common courtesy to others. Other diners were looking at them too! This is where the waiters should have said something to them too as they also noticed how loud they were being. I wanted to talk to my family and enjoy the view while waiting for my food.   Food was very mediocre and disappointing knowing that if we pay for a good meal, the quality should give us that \"wow\" factor. It did not. The food quality would be equivalent to an Outback Steak House, it's just the elegance and view of the fountains that makes it different.   Overall, staff should look out for other guests if they are causing some sort of disturbance to the restaurant, bussers that are refilling waters, packing up left overs should leave their negativity outside of the workplace. They were incredibly rude. Food was mediocre, overly priced. Basically you are just paying to eat next to the fountains. I wouldn't come back but it was an experience.",

The meal was a bit pricey, as the whole menu is, but it's fine dining. I loved the elegance of the restaurant. I highly recommend Prime Steakhouse for special occasions.",

    "text": "Food here was good but by no means was this the best steak I've ever had. The gimmick is the different house-made steak sauces they offer but to be honest, it was underwhelming for me. A good quality steak requires minimum spices and sauces to taste amazing (see Maestros in LA). What your paying for is the real estate, especially if you get seated by a window or outside. What felt out-of-place was the lady walking around taking pictures of your party and then trying to sell them each for $20. I felt this part was pretty un-classy for a spot with $50+ entrees. The service was good and the attention to the detail showed. I'd come back again for a special occasion or bring someone who hasn't been before. Nothing like eating a delicious steaks while the fountains dance to the tune of Sinatra on a man-made lake in the middle of the desert.",

I'm so glad to have finally tried Prime before it ends up in history like other restaurants in Bellagio that have come and gone. We picked this spot to spend some time with family while enjoying the view of the lake from our table. The OpenTable app works wonders when booking a reservation. I even added that we were celebrating my sister's one year wedding anniversary and they still remembered that.   Service here was 5 stars all the way, it kinda reminded me of the service at received at the SW Steakhouse inside the Wynn hotel. First we ordered some drinks first off with some white wine to indulge in the evening. My drink was the Long Island ice tea. They poured a good amount of liquor making me feel that buzz right away. I ordered the 18oz ribeye steak and split it with my Mom since it was huge. At least one pound. My sister and brother in law loved their dishes as well the side dishes.  The fountain show was going off every 30 minutes. The food is $$$$ but the service and food was totally worth it. I can be proud to say that I have finally ate at Bellagio's original steakhouse.",

Make sure you sit at the bar that Dave is serving at, you'll be in capable hands with the best choices and some very interesting surprises.  I came to learn Dave has been there for over 16 years and has quite a bit of interesting stories and history of Las Vegas.  Just ask about his famous deck of cards!

From the smooth, attentive, yet unobtrusive service to the sublimely prepared seafood platters or the stunning cuts of beef paired with wonderful selection of sauces and sides, I thoroughly enjoy every second here. What I love the most is that the wait staff make us feel like a million bucks from the second we are received. They never say \"no\". Everything can be arranged, customized or put together.

The Au Gratin potatoes and bread budding were both delicious. And the sauces they served with the steak were good. So was the bread.   After that, I really don't have anything nice to say. My $74 dry-aged bone-in ribeye was stringy and tough. My colleague ordered the same and agreed. If a steakhouse can't do steak, they fail. Period. We also had the broccoli with jalapeno cheese sauce, and (not sure how this is possible) it was basically flavorless.   The service wasn't great. He never asked if we wanted salads or appetizers. My drinks were always empty, and the last refill I asked for never came.   This was a complete and utter letdown (except for the potatoes). Will not be back.",

Tasty dressing to boot. The filet mignon was huge! Perfectly cooked and super tender. And it came with sides of sauces. I have a serious love for bernaise and the bernaise here most definitely did not disappoint. Go with the bernaise! Lather it on your steak! And for sides, I had the mushrooms and truffle potatoes. The truffle potatoes were positively divine. Creamy and delicious. And the mushrooms were a fabulous compliment to the steak. I had zero room for dessert, but the desserts looked delicious.  I thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience here. Prime is truly a top notch experience. A total Vegas must-do.",

I ordered the dry aged rib eye and it was fantastic.  To be completely honest.....steak is steak (relatively speaking), but having it in this setting makes it even more enjoyable.  Tip:  everything is a la carte, so if you're dining with two, having just one side may be enough food in addition to your steak.",

Chilean sea bass and beet salad were favorites.  Dover sole was delicately seasoned and also yummy.  Our table enjoyed the green beans and Brussels sprouts.

We paid $270 for our meal that night. The service was amazing, everyone was very nice and attentive. The reason why I am giving it four stars is because the food did not wow me for the price. The salmon was not very tasty and the steak was not well seasoned. The only thing that I loved was the view, which I am guessing is what you are paying for when you go here. Other than that I don't think it's really worth the price. I've had tastier food in Vegas for cheaper (Try Lago).",

The nutty full flavors that the dry aging process imparts on to the meat makes it my usual go to at any steak spot. The crispy salmon sushi was very very good. For sides the broccoli was very tasty as well. Our waiter was very well informed and enthusiastic which is always a plus.",

It was a special fun night.  Our waiter Thierry was so rude and condescending.  Truly awful.  I wish that we would have just asked for someone else.  The lady that started us out was so amazing then we had to endure his constant scowl and bad attitude.  Considering my husband and my bill alone was 700 plus dollars and there were 6 other people with us I'm sure our table spent an ample amount of money to have to put up with this nonsense.  Not pleased.    The food was all great  Tuna ribbons  Salmon sashimi  Mac and cheese  Oysters  Dover sole  Truffled potatoes  Creamed spinach",

Dim lights, sunset, the Belagio water for fountains every 15 minutes, and the wait staff treated us like we were the most important people in the world. There was a photographer to take pictures ($70 for the small package). The food was absolutely to die for. The best steak I've ever eaten, hands down, and the desert left me in heaven. I highly recommend this restaurant for any sort of special occasion dinner. And if you're looking for somewhere to propose (as my now Fiance apparently was) this is the perfect place to do it. As there is a wandering photographer, it's even easy to get pictures of the proposal!  Edit 8/2017: we came back to Vegas for our honeymoon, and of course had to go back to prime. The service and food was just as impeccable as the first time. Truly the best restaurant I have ever been to.",

It was extremely flavorful and was an excellent recommendation by the waiter.

    "text": "My gf & some good friends treated me to this place for my bday dinner! Reservations were made for 5:30pm. Things came up so we pushed it back to 6pm; they had no problem with that and were nice about it. A friend ordered a ribeye, and about 10 minutes later asked if he could change his order to a porter steak. They allowed it and were also very nice about it. A+ for service here. A steakhouse in the Bellagio... It was very nice & elegant, as one would expect from the sounds of it. We were seated in our own private room around a round table. We ordered - Porter steak: a friend & I ordered one. Delicious. Huge. Parts of my medium-rare steak were more so rare (a friend said it was still moo'ing), but I didn't mind. My friend's medium steak had parts that were more so medium-rare - he didn't mind this either.  - Filet Mignon: My gf & her sister got this. I honestly thought it was the best piece of filet I've ever sank my teeth in. - Ribeye: it comes in an 18oz and a 28oz. My friend is a big eater and he mentioned that he should've ordered the 28oz. - Mac & cheese: AWESOME! I ordered it with my porter, and I thought it complemented my meal perfectly. Yummmmmmyyy. - Asparagus: Fresh - Broccoli: Fresh All in all, the meal was a very memorable one for me. My steak & mac/cheese was delicious, and service was top notch. Very, very pricey. I do remember my porter steak being around 58$ on the menu, and the other steaks being of similar price. The side dishes were all around 10$ or more. *One of my friends wanted prime rib in particular and at a place called \"Prime\" Steakhouse, you'd think they'd have it, right? Wrong. **Advice: I'd suggest that you order ur steak to be cooked at one level higher than how you normally ask for it. Ex. If you like urs cooked at medium rare, ask for medium.",

Food - 6 oz filet mignon with blue cheese (just know that blue cheese topping is an extra $10). It was a nice cut, very tender and the sear was good too. I ordered these potato fingerlings. My wife called them high class french fries. Overall, excellent food. Ambiance - old school decor, 40's style furniture and design overlooking the Bellagio fountains. Appropriately dimmed for dinner. We (and many others) were dressed appropriately for this fine dining experience; however, I noticed (although a sign says \"No shorts\"), there were some guests looking like they just came from the pool. I guess they're more lenient during the summer. Idk. I'd like to say that I'll be back, but I'm not baller status and there are too many restaurants in Vegas that I want to check out. So maybe, we'll see. Nonetheless, I had a nice experience.",

Service was awesome, but i expect it to be at a place like this.  I started with the chilled seafood platter and it did not disappoint, my main was the dry bone-in ribeye  with mac and cheese side.  The steak was perfect, i found the mac and cheese a little bit on the bitter side, I'm used to a more sweet taste for my mac and cheese.  Overall, great place for a great dinner, expect great service and to be full by the end of your meal.",

I have to give him credit for having the guts to avoid the testosterone atmospherics of the traditional steak house.  A great steak is a must at any restaurant that specializes in red meat.  Prime does not disappoint in that regard. What I like about Prime is that all the other dishes, appetizers, sides, desserts are all super.",

These people acted like they've never been around a 3 year old. Who, by the way, was fully occupied watching cartoons, and being quiet. I felt the stares the whole time. We had to cut our meal short because of these rude people. Someone actually had the nerve to come up to my dad and ask us to turn off the cartoons! WHILE WE WERE PAYING THE BILL! Also, the restaurant was pretty loud to begin with. The volume of the cartoons weren't even turned up fully. You would assume people who come to spend a good amount of money on food would have manners & mind their own business. But, no. We talked to a manager who was completely understanding, & while speaking to a manager ANOTHER person came up to my Dad interrupting my father's talk to the manager asking what his problem was! I never want to eat here again. It's not the food or service, it's the people.",

    "text": "My wife and I went to the Prime Steakhouse restaurant last Friday to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary.   When we made the reservation weeks prior we requested a window table overlooking the fountains.  When we arrived we were told none were available.  When a window table near us did come available we asked if we could move there and were told NO by the manager.  The waiters, we had two that were sharing duty, one named Scott the other we can't recall,  never offered us a wine menu or asked us what type of wines we liked.  We had to request a menu and make our own guess which might be a good wine with our food.  My wife ordered the fillet mignon and I had ordered the salmon with sides of asparagus and truffled mash potatoes.   The steak was good but not cooked the way my wife requested.  Neither waiter ever asked us how the food was of if we wanted anything else.  They seem to spend most of their time chatting with other tables and ignoring us.    They did have a very nice lady named Grace who took our pictures which we purchased afterwards.  At the end of the meal the waiter did bring us a nice plate with some chocolate for our anniversary at no cost.  That was nice.  Overall the food was good but the service was mediocre at best.   We expected much better service for such a high priced restaurant.  We didn't feel very welcomed there.  We always stay a the Bellagio Hotel when we visit Las Vegas, but will not be going back to the Prime Steakhouse restaurant.  FYI - The night before we went to eat dinner at the Eiffel Tower restaurant across the street and were able to get a window table overlooking the Las Vegas strip and Bellagio fountains.  The food there was excellent with excellent service.  I would highly recommend that restaurant.",

Perfectly cooked medium rare and lightly seasoned. It was accompanied by 3 sauces but didn't need anything as the wagyu beef was flavorful and tender",

Unfortunately, that was the best part about the dinner.  We ordered two Filet Mignon, one medium, one medium rare.  The steaks came in as Well and Medium well.  We mentioned to the waiter that the steaks were over-cooked, my wife specified that she wanted a pink, but not red center.  The middle of the stead was grey, no pink at all.  My steak was not red at all, barely a hint of pink.  The waiter then had the gall to say that in the kitchen light, the steaks would look like the color that we asked for.  So he recommended that we get up out of our chairs and walk into the kitchen to prove us right.  The only way I would get up, would be to throw the overcooked steak in his pretentious face.  We were gravely insulted and were so embarrassed at the level of service.  We were debating leaving, but we were starving and could not wait another hour to eat.  He was an older Italian guy, with slicked-back hair and a hint of an accent.  We left a minimal tip, mostly for the bus boys and the other staff.  The guy was an absolute jerk. I won't be going there again.  The steaks had no flavor and were overpriced anyways.  I'll go back to Homestead at Caesars for real steak.",

I'm usually on top of snapping a few photos of everyone dinner plate. However, it was a special night celebrating my brothers bday and I got so excited to try all the dishes, I forgot. I've been on a health kick lately so this was a cheat meal. I must say FAITHFULLY cheated. It was delicious!! My brother enjoyed his dinner, too. That was my biggest mission. He religiously and generously is a high profile high roller in the family who has been to all the top spots around town. So it's hard to server this man a good, GREAT steak. The server suggested a the old aged prime rib! In addition, they brought 3 different house steak sauces to our table. Generally, I never care for the extra sauces but I couldn't resist. You have to try all 3 of them. That's exactly what I got and exactly what I recommend. Any restaurant at the Bellagio is generally a hit. Plan accordingly and treat yourself! MY TASTEBUDS WERE IMPRESSED!!!  Lack of one star is the service! I felt like the nagging customer reminding them we needed a refill, we needed a dessert menu, we needed our bill, we needed our server. It was towards closing time so most of the staff were occupied cleaning the tables down. :(",

I thought this would be the perfect combination of excellent service, food and ambiance. Instead it felt like an overpriced Disney experience. Jean George should take his name right off this one. The first bottle  of wine we ordered was out of stock, no big deal. We ordered another bottle, someone who appeared to be  the Somm came over, opened the wine, barely looked at us, poured and walked away.  Weird and awkward is how I would describe that experience.  I ordered the special , surf and turf.  It was a lobster tail that arrived sitting on grilled chili peppers and a filet.  There was no mention of surprise chili peppers with the lobster tail, and my boyfriend is allergic so I removed them and sent them back and kept the lobster.  The filet was blue inside, not the medium rare I ordered, so we sent that back. It came back a little closer to medium rare. The sides were overly salted and almost inedible. They took the fillet off of our bill but charged us for the lobster tail. As we were getting ready to leave the server reached  over to shake my hand and spilled my wine, he ran away and never came back. Which is what you should do as well. Go to Hyde instead. It's a great bar that overlooks the fountains, don't waste your money at Prime. We wasted  almost $500.00.",

    "text": "My fiancee and I have been to Prime maybe 6 times in the last 2 years and have always enjoyed it. I would say they have all been 5 star experiences and very close to SW, which is my favorite steakhouse on the strip. However, we came on Sunday and had a far worse experience, which I don't think is acceptable even 1 out of 100 times for a $200 meal. We asked to be seated outside and was sat at a table that had quite a bit of tree/brush/dirt on it. I thought this was extremely strange that the host (or servers) wouldn't have a crumber and sit people and clean tables. Secondly, we don't drink. I've never felt pressured here previously by previous waiters, and I definitely never felt like I had diminished service. However, I felt from the beginning that our server, who's name I don't recall, had a different opinion of us as soon as we said we didn't want any wine. He came by and asked on 3 different occasions, when we were never considering wine and had just said no. My fiancee is gluten free and had asked for gluten free bread, which I believe they normally make or toast fresh when asked for it. However, she had to ask 3 times. The bread never came out, which was asked of the 2 different servers we had. No explanation. There was a couple behind us that had a similar poor experience. They were pretty vocal about their disappointment as they had ordered a starter and a bottle of wine. However, their steak came out 5 minutes before the appetizer or bottle of wine. They were pretty vocal when the appetizer and bottle finally came out and the servers really didn't say anything. It was very strange. Then last but not least, we received our check and we had 2 glasses of wine on our bill. It was probably just a mistake, but come on. Look at the bill before you bring it over to me.  Just a very disappointing experience for us, and that's ultimately really what you're paying for at a place like this.",

    "text": "mmmmm, i was pretty unimpressed with prime. came here for dinner before clubbing at the omnia to celebrate a friend's birthday, so we were ready to eat (to pad all the alcohol..) the reservation was made about 4 weeks prior for table of 8 with a view of the bellagio fountains - no promises they said, but they'll make a note. i was pretty disappointed with our view - only 3 people could see the fountains at all, and with a very limited view. meh.  on to the food - we all got apps (foie gras for me) but others had oysters, steak tartare, salad, basically one of each from the appetizer section of the menu.  there was basically silence as we ate our food - there was nothing to say.  usually its a good sign because people are focused on their food and tasting it, but not with this group. we just didnt want to be rude... the apps werent very memorable. my foie gras wasnt complemented super well with items on the plate, and was more grainy than usual. bleh. on to the entrees..  since we were at a steakhouse, most people ordered steak. i got the short rib instead (cant eat much steak).. which ended up being a dry hunk of short rib that wasnt very tender, but quite salty! i was pretty disappointed. no imagination on the plating or accompaniments either. bleh. people seemed to at least enjoy their steaks - hope they werent overcooked.  overall...i didnt feel special at this restaurant. being a jean georges establishment, there was no refinement in the service or dishes that they served. everything was just 'all right.' their redeeming dishes were, with consensus from the entire group, the french fries and bread pudding. isnt that sad? the 2 bottles of wines we got were good, as well as the dessert wine, but they didnt produce those, did they. sigh.  i will not be returning here given the plethora of amazing dining options in vegas.",

Thinking we're not going to buy these anyways. Well the pictures turned out wonderful, so we bought them. What a very nice experience and the pictures to remind us of a nice time we had here.",

From the Fuji water that they pour from the bottle to your glass to the gourmet food, it is top-notch.  As classy as this place is, it is not quiet and stuffy.  I wore jeans and a dress shirt and my wife wore a cocktail dress.  We had a table of eight and were celebrating my best friends birthday and we were far from quiet.  Highly recommend for that special occasion, but not a place to go frequently.",

I was so beyond unimpressed with our service, after we ordered our original drinks and food we were never checked in on, and were never once asked, in the two hours we were there, if we wanted another drink. We were also celebrating our anniversary which we included in the notes for our reservation. While they did bring us chocolates to help us celebrate, our waitor may have well as thrown them on our table, he said congratulations and walked away. Ultimately there are way too many great steak restaurants in Vegas to eat here get unimpressive service, we certainly wouldn't recommend anyone to go here based on the service we received and don't plan to go back.",

The setting is beautiful, and we decided to have a table outside, right on the bellagio (prepare to get a little wet).    In our party, we ordered the dry rub rib eye, tuna steak, sea bass and a few sides. The steaks were very mediocre at best. The tuna tasted overcooked and lacked any distinct flavors. I didn't have a chance to try the Seabass, however it received a more positive feedback. The truffle mash was excellent.   Overall the experience was disappointing. At this price point, there are plenty of better options in vegas.",

Everything was delicious. The steaks were served with 3 side sauces: peppercorn, bernaise, soy ginger, and they complimented the meat very well. Coconut souffle with chocolate sorbet for dessert. My only complaint would be the offensive prices on the menu but it's Vegas ...",

    "text": "In the interest of full disclosure, dinner was hosted by someone who has been here before, has the means to make dinner phenomenal and even had a favorite server (Russell).  We started off the evening with a GIGANTIC seafood plateau with lobster, rock crab claws, king crab legs, oysters, huge prawns and a trio of delicious sauces.  Our server did us a service and suggested we ordered the plateau for four people even though we had five.  This appetizer alone filled me up half-way!!  Everything was super fresh and sweet.  That evening, Prime was featuring Tasmanian lobster tails.  You can add it to your dish as a \"surf and turf\" option, have it as an entree or order one for the table.  Our host went with one for the table and let me tell you...never in my life had I seen such a gargantuan lobster tail.  It was probably a foot long and 10 inches around.  It was presented, carved up and served to us with plenty left for the middle of the table.  Sweetest lobster I've ever had.  The flesh was firm yet tender (indescribeable).  No drawn butter necesary!  So Prime's thing is steak.  I went with our host's suggestion for the 5-peppercorn New York strip.  I'm really glad I did!  The flavor was bold and delicious.  It's what I like to call \"fancy steak\".  I had a few bites of our host's filet and that was melt-in-your-mouth delicious as well.  They give you three sauces to go with your steak and we ignored them all. For sides, we had their spicy mac and cheese, truffle mashed potatoes (DROOL...I could have had the whole thing on my own), sauteed mushrooms, and specially ordered caramelized onions.  All were great sides.  Alas, due to the giantness of our appetizer, I had to give up trying to finish my steak.  Meanwhile, my husband had no problems finishing his porterhouse.  We were contemplating dessert when someone let slip to our server that it was hubby and my wedding anniversary.  The dessert menus were respectfully plucked out of our hands and in short order, their signature chocolate lava cake was brought out to us, served with a delicious home made caramel ice cream.  They wrote Happy Anniversary on the platter which made it all the more special.   Prime has a great wine list of which I did not get to see.  However, the wines we had were delicious.  I brought the first two bottles (Kamen, CS, 2005) which opened up beautifully.  (NOTE: Their corkage fee is $35 but their policy is that they will only allow it if the wine is not already on their list).  Second was a D.R. Stephens CS 2005 and finally, the crowning glory, the Penfolds Grange 2001 (?).  I was in expensive wine heaven.  If wine tasted like this at a reasonable price, I'd have to have Al Anon on speed dial!  Our evening was fantastic.  Service was perfect.  It felt like we had an army of people waiting on us and constantly bringing us more water, constantly pouring us more wine.  Our server was almost embarassed that he caught our host pouring his own water and ran right over to take the bottle from him.  The best part was service was friendly, humorous and not at all snooty like a lot of fancy places.  This was definitely an experience to remember, even if I did stumble a little on the way out.  Just a little!!",

I went with a group 7 and we unanimously decided that this steakhouse was amongst the best we've dined in-not one complaint.  My lamb chops, although not medium well as i requested, was very tender and flavorful.  The broccoli rob that accompanied the lamb was good but a bit more bitter than i was anticipating.  Fries were great.  What sets this steakhouse apart from the rest was the ambiance.  The windows of the place looked right out on to the bellagio lake; we got great views of the water show all throughout the meal...nice little touch.    Service was outstanding; our waiter was polite, professional and attentive.  Like i said, a standard 3 course meal with drink and tip will cost well over $100pp so be prepared for that.  Bottom line-highly recommended, particularly if you're not on a budget.",

Although it was well seasoned and stood on its own, you are provided three seperate sauces (Bernaise, peppercorn and a ginger/soy) to enhace it if you so choose.  The service was helpful and professional as expected. It was a bit of a dissapointment however to be told of an intriguing truffle (flown in that day from Australia) risotto special and then being informed 5 minutes later that it had sold out.  The patio dining is what pushed this experience over the top and made it worth the considerable expense of about $150pp with tip and drinks.",

Our server, Thomas, was friendly, engaging and helpful throughout, making us feel at home in an environment slightly out of our comfort zone.  The food was excellent. I had the bone-in filet mignon - tender and sweet with a little extra flavour from the bone, and a delicious seasoned crust from the grill. The sprouts on the side were very good as well. My wife enjoyed her scallops very much as well. We shared a lovely warm chocolate cake for dessert followed by some nice tea (spot the English...).  One word of caution - this place has a dress code.

    "text": "I almost feel like a jackass for giving this such a low rating, but since my experience didn't feel any special, why not be honest right?  Once arriving at Prime, I noticed that things seemed to be a little out of order. My group (4 of us) had made a reso for 8pm, and arrived about 10 minutes early. Once I went to the hostess to confirm, she had told me it would be about 20 minutes (place was not even half full). Now, I don't mind waiting at all. I've been in the restaurant biz all my life, and I know the tricks of the trade. Mainly, when a restaurant is empty and they tell you to wait, it's generally a way to get you over to the side bar to buy a round of drinks. Usually I would take the bait because Kris loves me some drankssss....but this time we decided to pass since we were drinking at the pool all day.  Once finally seated, the service was outstanding. If there was no food involved, I would give this place 5 stars on the service I recieved. By service, I mean someone who greeted us quickly, explained the menu in detail, provided a wine list, and made sure drinks were filled at any opportunity they could be filled.  Now on to the food. EHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.  I am no food snob. I would rather eat nachos and dirty water hot dogs then have a fancy french dinner. However, I do enjoy a nice outing every now and then, and don't mind spending for it. The sides were very good. It was a few weeks back, but I remember getting a potato side that was outstanding. Also, their side of brocali was perfect.  The real problem was the steaks. 3 out of 4 of them were just horrendous. I ordered the Ribeye. I order Ribeyes' just about every where I go for steak. Mainly bc of the quantity, and the heaviness to the cut. This was probably the fattiest steak I have ever seen in my 26 years on earth. Where did they cut this from, the cows ass? Seriously, I was perplexed as to which part of the cow this fat came from. I looked around and almost laughed out loud because I thought I might have been on a game show.   I ate up all of the side dishes, and the portions were a good size. I left about 3/4 of the steak with all of the fat cut up on the plate. Now, I would NEVERRRR complain about food at a restaurant, it's just no my style. The way I look at it, I CAME INTO YOUR KITCHEN, and you cooked for me. If I don't like it, shame on me. However, being a bartender I know that if I saw my guest barely touch his 60 or 70 dollar entree, I would ask if something was wrong. The server didn't say a word as he took my plate, which made me want to shove it down his throat. (Just kidding, wanted to add dramatic effect!)  All in all, very nice place but I am sure there has to be better options for an expensive steak. And if there isn't, Im sticking to sushi and hooters.",

    "text": "Not impressed at all!  Specifically made reservations here to celebrate a special occasion for a friend more than 3 months ahead of our stay.  Asked for fountain view seating, outdoors if possible, and asked  for a special dessert item.  We did indeed have a fountain view, in the corner with another couple (not with our party) practically sitting on top of us, with my back to the view.  The outdoor area was open but that request was not noted on our reservation in their book (although it was listed on my email confirmation) and was full.  The food itself was of high quality, cooked to perfection, and very tasty in and of itself, but ruined by bitter sauces.  I could not finish my sea bass as the sauce was literally making me feel sick.  My guest enjoyed his steak but again, the sauce garnishing the plate left a lot to be desired and enough of it saturated his filet that he could not enjoy it nearly as much as he should have.  The dessert item was available and they did bring out a petit tray of complimentary truffles with a candle for my friend, which was appreciated.  Overall though, not worth our time or money.",
