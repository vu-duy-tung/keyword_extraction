    "text": "This was my 2nd time here. The 1st time, I came solely for the fact that it is Harry Potter themed.  I had the Nutella Latte and did not enjoy it. It had very little flavor.  No coffee flavor.  No Nutella flavor.  Fast forward to today... the world's greatest dog sitter is moving and since we have always wanted to go here together, we made a plan to meet and have some HP themed coffee. This time I opted for a White Mocha blended drink. This time, it had flavor but, sadly, not the kind you'd want. It tasted fruity. Like strawberry maybe. But definitely not like either white chocolate or coffee.  My star is for the decor.  Lots of fun HP stuff that would make me spend hours there if I had a good cup of something to go with it. Obviously, there are yelpers who love the coffee so if you are a die hard coffee person, maybe you will enjoy it.If you love HP, you should definitely go and check out the decor!",

The place is decorated nicely paying homage to the Harry Potter novels however not all the staff were familiar with the characters so when we placed our orders using names from the novels, Bellatrix, (Moaning) Myrtle, Dobby etc, the spelling was incorrect or not pronounced correctly.  It took away from the experience.   The drinks were well made and not too sweet considering the variety of sweet sounding menu items.  They could have been a little more creative with naming the drinks and desserts using more references to Harry Potter.  The only reference was the Butterbrew which they had ran out of by mid afternoon so we couldn't try it.  I had the Biscoff latte instead and it was perfect. Check the place out but let some of the hype die down first.",

Not expensive at all, basing my price range on the size and price range of Starbucks. Personal favorites include the Black Forest Mocha and Biscoff Cookie Latte. More n the sweet side, but you get that coffee kick, They also have a Mint Mojito Iced Coffee, similar to Philz Coffee back home in the Bay, definitely hits the spot. I'm also a chocolate croissant fiend, and the ones they have are soft and buttery and with just enough chocolate. My next coffee taste bud adventure will be the butter beer latte or the Blackberry White Mocha. Can't wait for my next trip over there!  The decor is adorable, and definitely for those in love with the world of Harry Potter. Service is always quick, and friendly. I love the sayings that are on the tables, and the white owl in the corner brings it all together. Quiet place in the mornings, great for quick coffee meet ups, some studying.

On our way out, I decided I wasn't caffeinated enough and ordered a lavender latte to go. I enjoyed that way more than the butterbeer latte. Will definitely come again.",

For $10 you get a well made sandwich on a gourmet bread. We ended our visit with butterbeers to go. Wow they were really tasty! Different from the frozen ones at Harry Potter but really close!

The place itself is so sick! What a great idea. The tables and wall decor is amazing for any HP fan.   What I liked most about the place is that you can ACTUALLY study there. It isn't just a touristy spot. The tables have a nice size, there are wall plugs and the loudness level is okay. It is a little dark in there though. Thats the only studying con.

The pesto chicken sandwich I ordered was decent and certainly filling.  The meal cost me $15 (inc. coffee) not a place I would frequent.  It has its appeal, a nice place to work on papers or projects but a little cramped.",

The Butter Brew taste like a Carmel macciato, mostly milk. The Nutella tasted like a iced mocha latte. Now on to the breakfast croissant... AMAZING! This buttery, flaky, fresh egg, and ham creation is so good. At first I thought, wow 8.99 is a little much for a breakfast croissant from a coffee shop. But let me tell you folks, this is worth it! It's completely fresh ingredients and you can tell! The cost for everything together plus tip, came to $38. A little more than what I usually like to spend on breakfast, but overall the experience was great. The employees we're very friendly as well.",

However, for the amount of coffee you get, the prices were way too high. $4.90 for a small latte seems a bit much, and that's before you add almond/soy milk for $0.55   I think the novelty of the shop will definitely bring business, but unless the prices go down, I don't think it would last long. I know that I won't be returning very often, which is sad because it's so close to my house.",

Luckily I got the 2 Groupons for $10.  This place is too pricey in my opinion.  The bill turned out around $23 for 2 coffees,  1 tea,  a chocolate milk and a few mini donuts.  The lavender latte was a big no.  Tasted like medicine.  The butter brew was way too sweet.  I ordered a hot tea lychee peach- which was $4.50 way too expensive for just tea.  The menu stated loose-leaf tea.  It was a tea bag...  Although the concept of the coffee shop is nice it's not somewhere I would go back to.",

    "text": "We wanted to come visit while in Vegas for dance nationals and to show our foreign exchange student since he adores HP. The Toasted Almond latte and Butter Brew blended were yummy and certainly did not disappoint. The Nutella blended was far too coffee and not remotely tasting of Nutella--for my teen this was a huge let down.  The major issue was the waffles. We ordered three Nutella and banana waffles at 10:57am. At 11:28, I asked if they were ready yet. My mother who ordered ahead of us already had hers. I saw other sandwiches come out of the kitchen but not the waffles. The response was that they have one maker. I understand this fully--we bake waffles. However, I am not sure of any waffle maker that takes more than 5 minutes max per waffle; most are around 3 minutes cook time. About five minutes later, we got the three waffles but they did not have any bananas. My daughter asked for the bananas and was given a cup with four thinly  sliced pieces for all 3 waffles!!! These waffles are $9.50. We were patient. We fully expect when paying that we got the product description. I would not recommend purchasing food here. The waffle was good but cold. The Nutella was a slight drizzle in a cup.  All in all, go for coffee and that's it. :)",

But i guess with all the hype i was expecting it to be too much Harry Potter...as in \"OMG did the movies explode in here?!?!?!\". Honestly, i guess it could have gone either way...too much or too little.... And i think they went with too little... But the little touches that they had that referenced the books were cute. Ambiance (4/5)  Service and flavor... Was actually pretty good. I really didn't have much time as i was in a little hurry... But i did take time to go over the menu and the menu was not gigantic but they had your norms. I originally thought that i was going to get nutella latte... But the barista encouraged me to try the Biscoff and i am so glad i listened to her advice. I got the iced Biscoff latte and it was superb.  If you like Biscoff.... You will definitely love this drink. Service was 5/5... And the flavor of the Biscoff in the latte was a 5/5.... Flavor of the coffee was a 4/5.... Honestly i still have to say that the best iced lattes I've ever had are still at Dutch Bros....   If i am ever in the area again... Would i come here... That is most definitely a yes! :)",

Bad Owl is a local, independently-owned business and it's obvious right away that it is NOT a run-of-the-mill corporate coffee house.  Did I mention excellent service?  Yes, the service was indeed excellent!  Hope to have this gem in the neighborhood for years to come.",

My only option was a muffin. I asked for an apple malt and the guy told me to hold on and check if they have it... Then I ordered a muffin and the guy was like oh idk what kind these are so I just picked a random one LMAO even though they were all marked... I asked for a almond one and he was like oh wait that's banana. So after three attempts I was like okay fine. I sat down and he's like oh so it's for here then... Yeah???? They also put a table in front of the menu how awkward  It was really confusing how to order. There's no signs and wasn't even sure where the line formed. They also don't have their WIFI posted in plain view, a girl next to me had to tell me it when I got up to ask, they should put it on their menu board. The prices are okay at most, cheaper than Starbucks. Their pastries are fairly priced too.   The interior is really cute except for the cheap sterilmate Walmart trash can in the front... Yikes! Also it's SOOOO cold in here like wtf. And such slow internet... Nothing would load or took 5 minutes. We eventually gave up after waiting 10 min for a webpage to load.",

    "text": "I solemnly swear that I am up to no good...  Who in Las Vegas hasn't seen photos an ads for Bad Owl coffee?  For the last couple of months, we've been bombarded on Facebook with images, and \"coming soon\" messages. Several friends have been here, and have given mixed reviews.  Some loved it, some hated it.    I'm a huge Harry Potter fan.  I've read the books several times, and can practically recite the movies.  My husband loves the franchise as well, so it was a no brainer that we'd stop by at some point.    I've wanted to come out since it opened, but the shop is on the other side of the planet, or so it seems.   We found ourselves out here the other night, however, after picking up our roommate from work, and we decided to stop in.   We were lucky enough to go fairly later in the evening, so there were no lines out the door.  The place was pretty busy though, with only a table or two that were open.    I have to agree with some other reviewers here on the decor:  Well done. There are lots of Harry Potter references, but nothing too blatant, and its understated enough to come off as fun, and not hokey.  Signs for platform 9 3/4, with Hedwig and suitcases...tables with references like \"I must not tell lies\", the deathly hallows symbol, \"Wingardium Leviosa\" and more...I like it.  We ordered an iced butter brew, and a lavender white chocolate latte.  Prices aren't too bad at all for drinks.  Food seemed a tiny bit steep, but I can't really comment on price for quality, since we didn't eat anything.  Next time.    I chatted with one of the kids working on the coffee and learned that they are being trained on latte art from Mothership Coffee.  That is cool.  Local shops helping each other instead of competing really makes me happy.   I asked the kid if he'd throw some latte art into my to go cup, since they usually only do it for the mugs.  He was a little self conscious about his ability, but he did really well.  I thought it was beautiful.    As for the taste of the coffee: its nice.  Its much better than Starbucks, in my opinion.  The butter brew was good:  not as sweet as the Starbucks secret recipe.  My lavender mocha was good too.  I'd have liked a touch more lavender, but it was still really good.  Improvements?  Not many that won't be solved as they are open longer.  My only \"complaint\" about the place is that their menu is on a piece of paper on a clip board.  It would be nice to have some kind of large board behind the counter to look at instead of a clip board...but its possible that this is still in the works.    Bad Owl has the potential to be a truly magical spot.  Mischief Managed.",

The pastries were dry and partly over cooked (locally sourced from a bakery I imagine). The seating is terrible and not good for kids - parents if you have little ones (toddler-infant), it will be difficult - and that's if you can find a seat. The staff was boring, unwelcoming and had barely any familiarity with menu items. All in all this is just another over-priced \"cafe\" taking advantage of the area average income and leaving out anything that could resemble the \"i plan to go here 3-4x a week scenario.   Oh and flimsy plastic ware while my Avocado Toast barely fits on this slender cheese board - you're kidding right?   Please do something to improve your business - I'm tired of giving large corporations like Starbucks my money but I won't pay for a less than pleasant experience.",

I've been to three different coffee shops in LV and ordered Nutella lattes... All 3 disappointed me until I tried the one at Bad Owl.

    "text": "Awesome place. The Harry Potter theme is well done here, not too excessive or juvenile. Staff is friendly and accommodating, even during a noon rush with a malfunctioning ice maker and repairmen around them!! They were on point.   Now for the product: coffee. I'm a pistachio fan so I tried the latte and it was beautifully crafted. Equipped with a foam design, the flavor was mellow and delicate but not in need of more sweetener. It was just right. The macarons are EXCELLENT. Whoever makes these, knows what they're doing. I recommend the passion fruit if you're into fruity flavors. Their sandwiches are also not bad albeit a bit pricey. The prosciutto and fig is a good one.   Overall, Bad Owl leaves a GOOD impression. Will return!",

    "text": "OK so if your a Harry Potter fan this coffee shop totally caters to the soon to be cult classic. Harry Potter books, train sign, caged owl and messages on tables all reference the famous movie/book series.   The decor has dark tones to represent the Harry Potter atmosphere. I felt it was neat and clean, would have a no problem sitting down for a few to drink my coffee. It is fairly small so come in early or you lose a spot.   The only issue I had was there process...there was 2 people in front of me and it took almost 10 minutes just place an order, I literally saw 3 people working on the same cup of coffee. Come on guys, smarter not harder. The coffee itself was delicious, so if your willing to wait and watch the circus behind the counter it is worth it for a good cup of brew.",

I've tried the flavor at a couple other coffee shops and it just is never great. This one was! Not too sweet and still tasted like coffee.  The only thing is how busy this place gets. It's great to see, however, it affects little things like wiping down tables in between guests - which you might have to do yourself - and overflowing trash. Although the place was generally clean, we wanted to jump on a table because there was a good amount of people there. (Monday afternoon.) It was a situation where when one person gets up to leave, you pounce on a table if you want it! Time it right - definitely don't visit here on a weekend if you're in a hurry!  While you're here, try the macaroons - yummy! Also, word to the wise: Don't sit by the tables right near Platform 9 3/4. You will probably be in many a stranger's photo.  Accio coffee!",

Being the Die Hard Potter fan that I am I have been dying to go.  Yelp says they close at 5:00PM but we got there at 5:30ish and there was a line out the door. No literally there were people patiently waiting for their turn inside wrapped around this small store front.  Now I understand that this place is new and everyone is super excited so I did expect a bit of a crowd. I did not expect to wait in a line outside the store for thirty minutes.   I didn't like that they didn't have real menus posted just some dirty papers that everyone's hands had been all over.   They only had one \"semi-Harry Potter\" themed drink and that was a Butter Brew latte and of course they were out.  I think it's a cute enough idea and as much as I really want to support local business and as much as I love anything Harry Potter if I'm being honest with myself I probably will not be back.  For $5.50 I can get a drink I truly love made super quick at Starbucks. I hate to say that but it's True.",

    "text": "So, when my social media exploded with news of a Harry Potter themed coffee place opening in Las Vegas NV literally days before I was to be in sin city, I had to add it to my itinerary.   The line out the door testified to the success of the blitz marketing campaign.  Bad Owl Coffee had been open for exactly two weeks and there was a line out the door.  Good sign, right?  While we waited, we took a look to evaluate the Harry Potter-ness of the place.  There was a really really nifty metallic owl sculpture on the counter.  I'd have been happy to take that home and put it in my office.  A brick wall in the back with a Hogwarts Express sign.  Beyond that, a wooden direction sign back near the restrooms likely had familiar destinations, but I never actually got close enough to confirm that. The tables had themed words and symbols etched into them, pretty cool.  Definitely not in-your-face Harry Potter, but enough to claim a theme.  Fans will be pleased.  We made it to the front.  I was curious about the Butterbrew latte, particularly since it was the only drink on the menu that that gave a nod to the theme that had been so highly hyped in all the press.  Well, okay, they did offer a lavender latte, and there is a Lavender Brown character in HP.  I suppose I should give them that, too. Other than that, a typical menu of the same old  hot and cold coffee drinks and some nice teas.   Okay, back to the front of the line.  I asked how long they'd been open.  \"weeks\", was the one-word response.  I don't know how, but she made \"weeks\" sound vague. Wow, I've been at new eateries and coffeeshops bunches of times, and they can usually tell you the day they opened.  They're  proud and excited and pumped. Clearly not the case with this young lady.  Fine, maybe she's had a long day.  I can sympathize with fatigue.    So I let it go and inquired \"What flavor do you put in the Butterbrew latte? Butterscotch?  Or something else?.\"   \"Butterbrew is butterscotch and a secret flavor I cannot reveal.\" The response was flat, as if she'd answered that question a thousand times already.  She probably had,  but hey, every customer right now is still brand new. If you're already bored with it, then why am I here?   The shine of all that promotion was beginning to tarnish.  Of course I ordered the Butterbrew latte - that was why we'd come.  I told her I prefer my drinks not so sweet and asked for half the typical syrup.  She replied that there drinks weren't too sweet.  Okaaaay.  Then she asked, I kid you not, if I wanted the espresso shots in my drink.  I am taken aback.  What? Aren't their lattes made with espresso?  Well, yes, she explained, but sometimes we leave the shots out for children.  Excuse me?  I'm a middle aged woman and my companion was 20 years my senior.  Children?  Yes, of course I wanted the espresso shots in my latte. By now I am as close to speechless as anyone has ever seen me.  As we turn to the next spot to pay, she rolls her eyes.  Apparently she thinks un-hip women over the age of 22 who want espresso in their espresso drinks are blind as well as overly demanding.  Wow.  I loved that they had a chip-reader that worked - so many businesses are still working on that.  I didn't love that I was charged $2.00 more than the price on the menu.  Are coffee taxes that high in Las Vegas?  By now my companion was uncomfortable with the noise level and was eager to escape the chaos, so I just skipped the option to tip between 15 and 30 percent and signed the tablet.  I glanced at the tip jar, which contained three five dollar bills.  No change, no singles.  Five. Dollar. Bills.  Seriously?  My 12-second old latte was lukewarm.  I cannot taste the secret ingredient.  I cannot taste the espresso, though I saw them put it in there.  I can not taste any secret ingredient. I can taste butterscotch syrup.  Lots and lots and lots of butterscotch syrup.  Maybe it needed a mix.  I swirled the cup, took another sip.  Even more cloying.  For the first time in my life, ever, I threw away a six and a half dollar coffee drink.  So, final take?  The decor is as Harry Potterish as they can be without violating Disney copyrights, I suppose.  The butterscotch concoction is a nod to fans, but poorly executed.  The price is high, the coffee isn't that good. And apparently customers who aren't young and hip and extra attractive need not wander in.   Good luck, Bad Owl Coffee.",

    "text": "No need to wait for your acceptance letter from Hogwarts, just come to Bad Owl Coffee to escape the muggle life!    Bad Owl Coffee is located on Eastern and Horizon Ridge, in the K-Mart shopping center.  Walking into the place was like magic, Harry Potter decor everywhere!  Each table had it's own unique phrase, whether it be Espresso Patronum or the Deathly Hallows mark.  I loved the Platform 9 and 3/4 wall! It made me want to grab a cart and run through it.  The atmosphere is amazing for anyone who loves Harry Potter!    If it wasn't Harry Potter themed, I wouldn't see myself coming back.  I got the Roasted Almond Latte.  What's cool is that they ground almonds into it to give it some texture.  The idea sounded great!  However, when I got my coffee, it was lacking... The latte was a bit bland, just warm, and the texture of the almonds didn't impact the flavor.  The almonds weren't grounded well, it felt like I've been chewing on them for too long.  We tried the Butter Beer Latte and the idea of what it should taste like versus what we actually had, was also underwhelming.  It wasn't overly sweet like the Secret Menu Butter Beer at Starbucks, but it didn't leave you wanting more.  The teas were also following the same trend as the lattes.  The Apple Malt and Jasmine Blueberry tea smelled better than it tasted.  We thought that maybe the tea bags needed to steep longer, so we waited...and waited.. and well.. It was still the same.    Maybe we ordered the wrong stuff?  But at 8 AM, I'm looking for something to wake me up.  I wasn't able to get a good caffeine buzz from anything that I tried.  I would come back to hang around some Pure-Blood fanatics!  I noticed a lot of the customers getting the Nitrogen Coffee.  Maybe next time, I'll skip the fancy lattes and take my coffee (Sirius) Black.",

    "text": "So today is the 2nd time giving this place a try only because I wasn't too impressed the first time.  This second time, I got super lucky with the line.  There was only a couple of customers in front of me which was better than waiting 15 min last time.  I can't rant and rave about the \"Harry Potter\" decor because I don't know too much about Harry Potter, so I'll just skip to the service.  The first and second time I went in there were only 3 workers at the counter.  The register person who takes your money and grabs your \"pastry/dessert\" if you ordered any and then either one or two people making drinks.  I honestly think the register person shouldn't handle the pastry even though he use tongs to grab the pastry to pack or to warm up, he doesn't actually wash his hands in between customers.  Registers shouldn't prep food unless they wash or at least sanitize hands prior to.  And I feel that while the register person grabs food, it slows down the order taking process.  They should hire more baristas.       The first time I came, I wasn't sure what to order.  I went with what people were saying was \"popular\" like their Butter Beer Latte.  Tried it, wasn't too impressed.  Just butterscotch flavor with milk.  I ordered their fruit tart.  While the flavor was good, the tart crust itself was hard as a rock.  It was just so hard to even penetrate it with a fork.  I literally had to pick up and bite into it.  After that experience, I just had to give it another shot.  Looked at their menu again before coming the second time being sure I ordered something I was more familiar with when I go to a Starbucks or other coffee shops.  The second go around I tried the Blended Bar, Matcha.  It was okay for me.  And I also tried the mushroom quiche.  That was pretty good.   Heated, the pastry was flakey and flavorful.    My cousins from Colorado wanted to try this spot out, and when I asked what they thought, there weren't impressed either.  My cousin's words were, \"The wait time wasn't worth the mediocre drink.\"  So with all that being said, will I come back?  Maybe, if I'm in the mood for a blended drink or quiche and it was the only coffee shop and when there is no line.  Happy Eatings or Drinking!",

Tasted like they blend some type of powder mocha with ice.  Couldn't taste the espresso at all.  Overall a trendy place but coffee was just disappointing",

The Asian lady (I assume is a manager or owner) pours in 4 additional scoops of ice to my already blended drinks .. Am I seeing this shit happen??  She makes 4 drinks instead of 2 and they taste more of ice than anything else.  The lady then gives the first two drinks to a customer who just had placed the order. I was so furious I wanted to throw the drink at this lady. Expensive watered down drinks with only 1 shot of espresso for 4 drinks.

    "text": "Love this place! I usually go in the afternoons when I just want to relax and read a book with a cup of coffee and a warmed up butter croissant or almond croissant. They are a bit pricey just like what is expected with any good coffee shop, but even pricier than Starbucks. A medium flavored regular menu item latte with soy and croissant is like $8 and some change and Starbucks and $10 and some change at bad owl. But on the bright side they have better almond croissants and the latte's are delicious never overly sweet like some places, but I'm sure if you would like it sweeter they would make it for you. So it's worth the price but I can't go here on a regular basis. So far for me they have never taken too long with the drinks or croissant. They do take a long time with food since I believe they make it fresh, or at least it tastes like it, so if you are in a hurry stick with a drink. I really love the Harry Potter atmosphere as well it's so unique. The employee's are awesome too!",

    "text": "If you have not tried this cafe before you need to! I love this cafe! I come atleast a few times a week and bring everyone who is visiting town because this Harry Potter themed Cafe is so much fun.  I was very inspired meeting the owners and hearing their vision for the cafe. They  truly care about their product and customer experience. A Harry Potter themed Cafe intrigued me and upon first walking in the decor did not disappoint. From a payphone booth, to owl cages, to all the fun harry potter themed words on the tables, the cafe makes you feel as if you have entered a mystical wizardry world.  The menu is my favorite part. All of their drinks and coffee are high quality and there is a huge variety. I am not a big butter beer fan but it is a very popular drink. My favorite latte drinks are the Spanish latte, white chocolate coconut, and the Iced Mint Mojito which  tastes very similar to Phil's Coffee in San Francisco and is flavored with a real mint leaf. I tried there Sea Salt Iced coffee but was I did not like it so much. I could not taste the sea salt cream as I usually can at other cafe's and bubble tea places.  They have a cool coffee that is made from glass bottles that look like it came from a science lab. I also tried the nitro infused coffee, which is coffee infused with nitrogen. It comes straight from the tap and the foam makes it look like a Guinness beer. However the taste is awesome if you like strong coffee and it was so much fun as I had never tried style before.  The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly and you can tell they know what they are talking about. There is a passion here for great coffee and customer service and I am love coming here.",

I ordered the nitrogen infused coffee after reading about it online and was excited to try it. The presentation was so cute and it smelled nice. Huge disappointment. I love coffee, especially black coffee and can do without sugar. This coffee however, was just a no. The coffee itself tasted like a burnt pot of coffee that'd been sitting for 2 days. The taste sat with me the whole day and made me a little nauseous. The only thing that I actually enjoyed was my friend's drink which was the Blackberry mocha. I liked the place itself, just not the coffee I ordered. Will try again soon.",

The winter peppermint white chocolate mocha was yummy!  It's a cute (but small) cafe and a fun place to hang out.   On my last visit I had some blueberry toast. It was HUGE and delicious. It was a giant slab of whole grain bread with almond butter, blueberry preserves, almonds and coconut. It was really delicious and filling. It is supposed to have banana, but I'm allergic. Any additional fruit and it probably would have been too much to eat.   My only complaints are really minor, and not enough for less stars. 1. The mochas aren't ever hot enough for me. I like them super hot. And 2. The sizes feel a little small. I'm paying for higher end ingredients so I appreciate the cost, but I'd like a 20 oz large, not a 16 oz.",

So as it was Mother's Day on Sunday and her birthday was on Saturday I decided to go in and get her her favorite coffee! (I'm Late every year)  I wasn't sure if they sold bags of whole bean coffee, but I walked in anyways! It was Saturday morning about 10:30am and the place was a buzz and the parking lot was busy busy busy! Which is always a good sign!   Walked in and there was a line to the door... so I thought I'd walk in and scan the surrounding shelves.... no coffee... so I waited back in line.  Glad I did because right near the register near the menus Was a little sign that gave me info on coffee beans whole or ground and bag size info plus the various options to purchase!  Yay!!!!   I ended up buying 3 bags of whole bean coffee all different selections... so Mom could enjoy all of them and then I purchased the cutest espresso cup and saucer set! Was adorable! Perfect for her!!  The service was great and super friendly!   Maybe next time I'll stop by for a coffee and a bite to eat... cause the plates of food whizzing by while I was in line looked Delicious!!",

    "text": "We found out about this place because we were looking for croissants, while at the hospital. They were delicious. So we came back on Saturday, it was so busy and the food took awhile but it was fine. It was so busy.   Because of this we came back today. We were waiting for a doctors appointment and went here cause it was close and to get a quick bite to eat.   When ordering we asked how long the waffles take and she said 7 minutes, but if you order 2 it will be longer. So we ordered just 1 because he didn't have much time. And then we ordered a sandwich and our coffees. We let them know obviously that we don't have time.   After 30 minutes of waiting, with almost no customers in store. As the employees are leaning on counters, talking to each other drinking their coffees. Now we needed to head back, so I asked them what's going on with our food, they said they are plating it. That the food has to come out together...but everything else comes separately.   So we were telling them we have to go, so they were putting it to go. But even to go it was useless because we had to go back to the hospital and we can't bring the food with us.   So as we were telling them our issues, not one sorry. The girl just says \"just give them a refund\" not even wanting to hear our concerns and how to better their service. Basically telling us here's your refund now stop complaining.   We came here while waiting for a doctors appointment, a follow up for a craniotomy, because the doctor had an emergency surgery that took longer than expected so we had some time for food. Since we would be waiting longer. So now we wasted time, no food, no sorry, no apology.  All because your customers look normal, like they have a lot of time this isn't the case. One of your customers who was wearing a beanie, underneath has stitches and staples in his head. And you treated him poorly, assuming \"just giving a refund\" is enough. So now while waiting to get the staples and stitches removed after undergoing a craniotomy, you take your time talking, drinking coffee, and just throwing refunds at customers who are in a hurry.   So we left the food got our refund and left.   This place would be a great place, it would have been my go to coffee place. The food is good, coffee is okay. Love the Harry Potter theme they have going. But I will never return.   As people, who also run a business, I advise the owner of you read this, re-evaluate all your employees. There were 5 employees that we saw in the front. The store had about 4 customers 3 of which have been there for a long time prior to us arriving. And it took them 30 mins to make a sandwich and a waffle.   All these bad reviews are because of your employees. You have a gold mine here, your food is delicious. But what's the point, when you are chasing new customers away with horrible service",

This coffee shop a far drive for me as it is deep in Henderson and I live on the opposite end of Vegas, but definitely worth a visit at least once, especially if you love teas and coffee.  I'm not sure who helped me the night I went, but it was a girl with a Finding Nemo tattoo on her arm. She was personable and extremely helpful --she gave us (my friends and I) all great recommendations based on our conversion. I was super picky since I am caffeine-sensitive and didn't like cinnamon, and she went through the menu for items that I could have. I ended up getting the butterbeer (hot) which was pretty good, but definitely way too filling for an post-dinner wind-down.  I'm interested in coming back here if I am ever on this side of town! :)",

I was overwhelmed by the sheer options of lattes and other warm beverages. Yelp was offering a 20% discount for checking in on iced lattes so I decided to do an iced latte to help me narrow down my choices, but it didn't help much. My husband ordered a hot coconut latte and he loved it!!! It's hard to impress this man with much but he thought his latte was excellent. We also shared the croissant breakfast sandwich and we both liked that as well.   I loved the subtle homage this place pays to Harry Potter. It's a cool place that both kids and adults can enjoy.

I felt they just put up the minimum amount of HP decor so they could name the place bad owl. They could have pushed the HP theme way further and really made it stand out. O and there is a tardis...  I had the iced lavender latte which was very good but the serving was small for the price. The food is way over priced ($10 for a grilled cheese). I will most likely not return to the bad owl.",

We got the butter brew latte with coconut milk and the Nutella latte with 2 chicken pesto and mozzarella sandwiches. So good!! And the service was up to par. Alex (same as me :) ) was so nice and friendly and welcoming! Which again is something I look for when trying a new coffee house! Inside is cute and quant. They offer board and card games you could play while sitting at a table and their wifi is free. Overall this place was a great find. Bad owl coffee you just got yourself a new regular!!",

For someone who is not a Harry Potter kinda person, it was cool.   They have a lot of options at this cafe. From expressos to lattes, and food options like breakfast, waffles and sandwiches.  The service is great and the order taker takes time to advise the ingredients of the order and if additional options are recommended. She even makes sure that your cup has your name spelled correctly.   I ordered the breakfast croissant, butter latte and Nutella latte. They were amazing! I would totally return here because this place is really detailed with their lattes and it's hard to find a place like this in vegas.",

    "text": "I love coffee and Harry Potter so when I first heard of this coffee shop I knew I had to try it the next time I was in Vegas. It's in Henderson, close to my mother's house, but definitely not close to the Strip for most visitors coming to Vegas. The Harry Potter theme is not over the top. Going inside you'll see to the left, over a large high top Counter table, a string of letters just like the ones sent to the Dursley's house. Right across from it is a brick wall and that says platform 9 3/4. From past pictures on Yelp I saw there used to be a luggage with an owl on top that resembles Harry's luggage, but the time i visited over the weekend it was gone. Also, different cute sayings are written over the top of the tables when you sit down.   As for the coffee, I ordered an iced butter brew latte with chocolate croissant and my brother got the coconut mocha latte iced. I'm not too picky and a big fan of frappes and different flavored coffees so I was happy with my choice. It tasted just like the butter beer from universals studios. There were only a few other Harry Potter themed drinks/food but most were items you'd see at any other cafe/coffee shop.   This place is a cute cafe with a subtle Harry Potter theme, close to where I usually stay in Vegas, so I would definitely come back and like to try their other offerings, such as their butter beer waffle. But for most who stay at the strip I wouldn't necessarily recommend making your way out to see it. Also, one star off for the price. Total for 2 small iced lattes and one chocolate croissant turned out to be $14 which is a little much for me",

The design of coffee shop is classy and chic with base tones of greys, silver and black. They have a labtop bar and small tables with Harry Potter quotes with coffee puns, to chat with your friends or just read a book! I have ordered several times the Toasted Toffee coffee and even tried their buttery, fluffy waffles! Super tasty and scrumptous! I am not a huge Harry Potter fan but I do share an appreciation for the artistic renderings of the literary arts. (P.S. You should listen to the audio books with Jim Dale on the Harry Potter series!) The only thing that is unfortunate is that it closes early around 6pm. So completely different from other coffee shops, this place rates a number one in all areas from atomosphere to execellent coffee!",

Upon arrival everyone was friendly and served our coffee in a timely manner. I also have no complaints with the quality of the coffee. We both had Nutella Latte s with almond milk and they were well done and the espresso doesn't taste burnt. Quality stuff. My complaint with this place is simply the fact the it's a \"Harry Potter theme\" but the only Harry Potter decoration they really had were a couple of signs here and there. I would've really liked to see the theme taken to another level. I don't know, maybe have the staff dress in HP robes or something?

I went in with a friend and ordered there new pumpkin latte, I'm vegan so I asked the guy who took my order if I could substitute milk for almond milk, the guy who took my order was very rude, I know having to do something out of the normal order is so hard to do but I'm sorry ! Anyways he asked another worker if that was okay and the other worker said yes . I asked two times if the substitute milk was the only milk in the latte and he said yes, I'm sure he just didn't know the answer and was to lazy to ask . Fine, the other gentlemen who actually made my drink was very very kind, I didn't catch his name but he was awesome ! After I was done placing my order I stood where they make the drinks and the other guy who was making my drink asked me if I was lactose and tolerant because there is a pumpkin ingredient they use that has milk in it and he wanted to know if it was okay to use that ingredient and I answered that I am actually vegan and no it's not okay to use that ingredient, he then continued making my drink, and asked me how my day was going . Then gave me my drink and said \"here is your pumpkin latte veganised \" he truly turned my bad experience into a really great one ! Sad I didn't catch his name . & my latte was delicious !! Thank you to whoever you were to actually take the time to make sure my drink was exactly how I wanted it .",

Fair enough they make the drinks in the order they are placed, but after waiting for them to make drinks for three other people I watched the baristas struggle with the nitro spouts for 10 minutes until I finally interrupted them and said I would have something else. At this point the four people behind me had got their drinks and two more received their complicated latte drinks before I finally received my average iced coffee. The barista was apologetic about the wait but I'm not impressed enough to come back. If you are not in a hurry or don't care about efficient service you might like this place.",

    "text": "Wow was this is a place I really wanted to like!  This is actually the first place that I felt compelled to write a review for.    After discovering that this cafe was blocks away from my work, I decided to give it a try.  Now considering that this was after 5 o'clock, I figured it would have been a lot more crowded than it was.  Just myself and one other patron.  Now if you are a Harry Potter fan, you can imagine the hype that was displayed when such a place like this opens up in town.  Decor was average, I honestly expected a lot more from a supposed Harry Potter themed cafe.  Although I am guessing that it is just basic decor from a business that is just barely starting out.  For a town that can somewhat lack \"mom and pop\" type places like this one, I also expected the experience to be a lot more personal.  Although the barista was quite friendly, I would not say she was very helpful.  When I visit a place for the first time, I announce to the server/cashier that it is my first visit, and usually I am greeted with \"Welcome\", \"This is one of our most popular items\" or \"My personal favorite drink is...\".  I was not offered any such help, and would've appreciated a little more interaction with any members of the staff.  On to my order.  I ordered the Mint Mojito Latte.  Now for \"12 ounces\" this was the smallest 12 ounces I've ever seen in my life.  Starbucks' Tall drinks are 12 ounces as well and I would say this was quite smaller than that.  And at nearly $5 for the 12 ounce, there are better deals than this one.  Now it is to be expected that a drink named \"Mint Mojito Latte\" would contain actual mint leaves.  Which it did!  What started out as an expectation for WHOLE mint leaves (which would provide flavor but no distraction) actually resulted in huge mouthfuls of small chopped bits of leaves.  I drank a coffee plant concoction! I also couldn't say it was very \"coffee\" either.  The actual definition of Latte is \"a type of coffee made with espresso and hot steamed milk, milkier than a cappuccino.\"  Although this drink was quite milky, it tasted like ZERO coffee was ever included in my drink.  Attempting to give this place the benefit of the doubt, I decided to order the Charmingly Pesto sandwich.  A grilled chicken, pesto and mozzarella sandwich that was actually quite good.  It ended up being the most redeeming quality of my visit.  All in all, I have been to better places.  Far more affordable places, with friendlier staff that offer more affordable options or of better quality.  Would I visit again? Most likely not.",

Nice vibe and would be my go-to if it weren't so busy all the time. Waited 45 min today and it's been open for a few weeks now. Had the Spanish latte due to the negative reviews of the overly-hyped butter brew. I enjoyed my coffee and conversation with friends. I love the idea behind it and it's genius for marketing and sales, but if it were mine, I would've gone a lot more in depth with the theme. Was a little let down by how unmagical it seemed, but it was a nice experience overall. Just didn't quite live up to the hype.",

Owners Bailey and Yuzo have brought LA coffee culture, Kyoto drip style cold brew coffee and an array of flavors (Butterbeer!) that make any espresso drink worth a try. The MAJOR draw to this shop for me besides the coffee is its Harry Potter themed decor. Each table has either a quote or chapter folio designed into the wood finish. Platform 9 3/4 is also situated by the front door with Hedwig perched precariously staring at you. Their pastries are great and they have a LOT of different leaves perfect for pot of tea if that's your thing. They will soon serve beer and wine and savory foods I hear... Check this place out!",

It's located right at the corner of horizon ridge and eastern parkway in the k mart shopping plaza, and features a very modern and sleek interior inspired by Harry Potter.  The walk in entry is comfortable and spacious providing a clean place to savor the aroma and seating is plentiful. It felt very welcoming, both to muggles and death eaters alike. One of the first things I noticed was the Japanese Kyoto style coffee drip tower, which allows ice to slowly melt and filter through the ground coffee beans into a coil and collected, relying on a slow drip rather than heat to brew providing a lighter body and more delicate taste, yum!  Service is excellent and the owners were more than warm and welcoming first thing upon entering. The back wall of the shop also has a couple leather chairs for sexy slitherins like myself.  I got the lavender latte which was nice and smooth with a good sense of a floral taste that wasn't distracting to the bean flavor at all but rather, complimented it. Even Hermione's Obliviate spell wouldn't be able to erase that flavor from my mind.  If you need a clean and good spot to relax a bit, get away from that \"he who shall not be named,\" and grab a fresh cup, bad owl is best spot to do so!",

The setting is comfortable like Starbucks. There's lounge chairs, stools and tables for dine-ins. Even if it's just for studying or work to conversations.   As I walked in, I expected a long line of customers flowing in because of the hype and talking going around about this place. Advertisement through word of mouth and media sites spread fast. I ordered my items through a menu that was posted on a clipboard which was near and creative. They have fresh pastries and snacks out on display and updated coffee machinery along with an updated ordering system. You can tell this place was Hip.   People say they don't like the coffee too much but only go for the experience. They either say it's too bland or too sweet. But I personally love it. I'm a heavy coffee drinker and I love mines sweet. They do make they're coffee strong, so that's better when it comes to drinkers like me. You can actually tell them how u want your coffee, so it's really up to u on how ur coffee is made done right. If it's bland, that's you have options to put in your own cream and sugar that they provide on the counter after they serve it to you at the pick up end.   Location is close to my house so it's a nice spot for me to go and pick up a cup of coffee on the way to school or study there when I have time.",

    "text": "The first couple times I came here I was very impressed by the theme of the coffee shop, decorations, and the proximity of this place from my house. After coming for the third time, I realized the reality of Bad Owl Coffee.  The Drinks: 2/5 The first time I came to Bad Owl I decided to try to Butter Beer Latte and see what all of the hype was about. I was very disappointed with the Butter Beer Latte. First off, the price is ridiculous. For a 12 oz it's $4.40 and for a 16 oz. it is $4.90 which isn't too bad, but the cashier asked if I wanted espresso in it. Which I thought was strange because ALL lattes have espresso in them. That is what a latte is, espresso and milk. I was thrown off guard by his question, but just thought that maybe people don't like it with espresso. I told the cashier I wanted espresso in it and he charged me $1 more for the espresso. Which added up to $5.40 plus tax which came out to almost $6. I was in shock by how expensive it was. I got my drink and was dissatisfied with it. It was ridiculously sweet and I couldn't even taste the espresso. It just tasted like milk and syrup.   The second time I came to Bad Owl was because I was convinced to give them a second shot. I tried the English Toffee Latte this time and It was good, but a bit too sweet. It was $3.95 for a small and $4.95 for a large.  The Staff: 3/5 I think it depends on when you go, but it's a hit or miss with the staff. They're either really nice and friendly or they don't want to be bothered. It's mostly the young high school looking workers that have an attitude where they don't want to be bothered.   Overall: The decorations are cute and all, but the place is really small and it is overpriced. I think there are many other coffee places you can go to without paying an arm and a leg for coffee.",

I couldn't decide and got both......it was good enough to come back!  Fast forward a year later this place is still booming and now they are offering food!!! I was so excited and so let down :(  coffee is still amazing! But the food is nothing impressive. I ordered the waffle, it was super well done and super crispy. Looked better than it tasted.   Also, random, but the lids don't fit on their cups and people were accidentally spilling as they were picking up their coffees.  Also-they do have a current Groupon 6$ for 10$",

My husband ordered a hot Butterbeer (which has no espresso) and my sister-in-law ordered a caramel latte and a donut. I loved my drink - it was one of the best I've had in a while. Even my husband loved it and was super jealous. (His drink was good but really sweet. Like a butterscotch steamer.) The waffles were good but nothing exciting.

    "text": "Maybe I'm biased because this entire cafe is catered to Harry Potter fans. Or maybe it's the TARDIS door I missed when entering on the right hand side. However, no matter where I looked I could find no wrong here.   Let start with the menu, each item is filled with punny items from Harry Potter, which made me chuckle so much it took me a hot minute to order. I ended up getting a lavender latte and their bacon grilled cheese with goat cheese and no guac. One of my friends ordered their nitro cold brew as well as their Hogwarts house espresso shots and the same sandwich as I did. And my other friend just got the breakfast platter.   Once again I could see no wrong here. There are games they have stored on the bookshelf, along with the entire Harry Potter series. Each table has a different quote from the books, where we were able to play while enjoying our food and drinks.   We played a card game based on \"never have I ever\" and enjoyed our time there.  The Harry Potter shots are each a different flavor. Gryffindor being cinnamon, Ravenclaw is rose, Hufflepuff is butterscotch and Slytherin is coconut. My absolute favorite was Hufflepuff... but I'm also biased for my own house as well.   That sandwich though! That was delicious. I did end up eating half of my friends sandwich and honestly, the guacamole just doesn't fit. There is already the creamy cheese on the rye bread with their delicious bacon, and the consistency of warm guacamole is just not as appetizing.   I absolutely loved my lavender latte. They make the syrup in house and it's delicious. Unlike most establishments the flavor is not lacking or artificial tasting.  Thus place is a wonderful place to hang out, have a bite and just chill around!    Happy Eating!",

    "text": "Bad owl has been my favorite coffee shop in the area since it opened. It has a nice atmosphere and the breakfast is one of the best I've had. The waffles and avocado toast are winners for sure. The only thing I found annoying is that, being a bit of a coffee connoisseur, when I would ask the staff about what beans or roast they were using they would give me very generic answers. This has happened multiple times and it seems to me like they are not very knowledgeable which I found annoying especially when they offer a V60 pour over. Might as well just order the normal coffee on tap if there is nothing special about it that makes it worth the price premium. Also, the water seems much too hot for pour over so they definitely should see if adjustments need to be made. Should be between 195 and 205 degrees. Overall, it is a great place for a coffee that is higher quality than Starbucks, but probably better for the majority of people who don't really know a lot about coffee or just want a basic milk based or flavored drink. I come here more for the breakfast than anything.",

I always feel that these trendy coffee shops are a little over priced, but compared to Mothership, which I feel is similar, I enjoy both the coffee and the ambience more. It's roomy and I dig the Harry Potter inspired decor. Also, they have alcohol! What a nice surprise. Definitely a bit of a drive for me coming from southwest, but I definitely enjoyed my experience here.",

Not rude or anything but also not friendly.The vibe and decor just clashed. I thought because of the theme of decor it would have a friendlier and more energetic vibe.

My boyfriend, who isn't a Harry Potter fan, also enjoyed the atmosphere and his Kyoto iced coffee. Thank you for such a great experience!!",

This time, it has been open for awhile so we were able to get in for lunch and get a table. I ordered an iced butterbrew latte with espresso added and my husband ordered an iced coconut white mocha. For food, we ordered the avocado toast and the siriusly prosciutto sandwich which had fig butter and goat cheese! I love that combo of flavors!. Food was delicious and so was the coffee, my husband's was a little too sweet, but it was still good, and of course decor in the shop was great. We love Harry potter and coffee and it was cool to see the 2 themes blended so well and have amazing food and drinks at the same time. We will be back next time we are in vegas.",

I've worked in coffee for 10 years, I love it and I cherish coffee and tea, I love the food and beverage industry. But with a lot of coffee joints, the one thing that seems to stand out the most is consistency. Of course, this place is new so of course I'm going to give it a few tries! I actually like where this coffee establishment is located, let alone they finally put a local coffee shop close to home instead of traveling into the worst construction areas! I do have to say the blended Nutella beverage is good, super smooth!!   Of course I'm going to come back and give this place a few more tries! Hey!

    "text": "After hearing everyone and their dog rave about this new Harry Potter themed coffee shop, I decided to join the bandwagon. I love the concept but it's over hyped in my opinion.   I came here on a Sunday morning and was greeted by a long line. Didn't mind the 20min wait because it gave me some time to look around the shop. I'm not a Harry Potter fan but I can see how some die-hard Harry Potter fans would go crazy over a shop like this.   Service was alright. Line to order was moving slow but once you order, drinks comes out fast. Open kitchen so you get to watch them make your drink which I liked.   Like I said, I am not a Harry Potter fan so what stood out to me the most wasn't the Harry Potter decor around the shop, but their Kyoto cold brew coffee system on the right side of register. It makes their kitchen area look like a chemistry laboratory. There is a big chunk of ice at the top but as the time passes by and ice melts, ice water drips down the glass pipe and filters through coffee and finally makes a cold brew coffee. Too dope!  I decided to get the lavender white mocha iced. Coffee wasn't too strong but it had a strong lavender, floral taste to it which I didn't quite enjoy. Personally, I feel their lavender white mocha is an acquired taste.  I also got to try sea salt nitro brew which I believe is made with nitrogen and has a velvety consistency. Too strong for me and I didn't like it too much. I'm not much of a coffee drinker so some may like this. Just a side note that sea salt nitro brew only comes in one size.   It's one of those first and last visit. I wouldn't come back again.",

Some flying letters up above & Platform 9 & 6/8* off to your right welcome you to the wizarding world and if you're up for it the barista's will happily make you a butterbrew latte to complete your stay.   I ordered a lavender white mocha that was quite good, but tasted none like lavender and Matthew ordered a London Fog at the recommendation of our barista. The London Fog was a cup of Earl Grey combined with steamed milk. It would've been perfect had it come sweetened, but that was nothing that a tear & a flick of the wrist couldn't fix.   If you're not in the mood for coffee or tea (and you have the liberty to do so), Bad Owl also serves beer and wine! On Thursday's, they offer bottles of wine at half price, so grab a cutie & head on over. We may even see each other there!",

The coffee is pretty good and they have a variety of flavors to choose from. Was disappointed during my visit because they had no butter beer, which was one of the things I wanted to try and reason to come! I was able to decide on Matcha Green Tea Affogato with Expresso & Salted Cream Nitrogen Brewed Cold Coffee. The affogatos can come with or without the expresso, but having it without defeats the purpose of an affogato! It was good, although it only had the hint of green tea -- would've liked it to have more of that distinct taste and flavor of matcha. The Salted Cream Nitrogen Brewed was interesting. Served cold, in a glass cup. Poured from a spouted barrell, strong foamy coffee, topped with salted cream - definitely a good caffeine kick, but nothing any other coffee shop can't fix. My sister wasn't too impressed with her Matcha Blended (aka green tea frap), again because there's only a very faint taste of the green tea, she says she's had better. My sister's husband definitely wasn't impressed with his drink. He got the Mint Mojito Latte. Every sip (with and without straw) contained big chunks of mint leaves, it was hard to taste the coffee itself. I don't know if it maybe wasn't muddle right or maybe too much leaves in general, but I don't think anyone would enjoy drinking leaves. Love the decor details and theme though (ie. the full series of books, the table writings, the owl, etc), and because again, Harry Potter!",

They have the best coffee shop menu and the best prosciutto Sandwhich I've probably ever had. Their menu is pretty extensive but their staff is friendly and willing to help and make suggestions. I love their nitro cold brew coffee. They also have Caradito which you don't really see in vegas. Today I ordered a gourmet pb and j which was recommended to me.

    "text": "BOC popped up on the radar a little while back and so it was bookmarked.  The GF is a huge Movie-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named (MWMNBN) fan.  I could not wait to take her when we were visiting or passing through Hendo.  We even planned a stop at the beginning of March before we headed off to Arizona.  That stop did not come to fruition. Maybe it was magic that made this happen. Knowing what I know now...I am so happy.  So on April 1st (ironic), we found ourselves on the southend of the valley.  After running several errands, we decided to pay BOC a visit.  Having heard about the line, we were pleasantly surprised upon pulling into the parking lot and not finding one coming out the door.  After checking in with the handy dandy yelp app, I held the door open for the GF.  She entered and I followed.  Small was the interior and every table was occupied.  Some tables filled with groups and couples chatting.  At the other tables sat lap top campers.  I knew immediately the experience was going to be to go.  I looked at the menu even though I knew I was going to get an iced 20 oz. Butter Brew Latte.  The GF was going for an iced tea.  The service seemed rushed and was not very memorable.  It was the kind of service one would expect from some corporate coffee shops.  After the order was paid for, the GF and I took in atmosphere.  She has read all the MWMNBN books.  She has seen all the MWMNBN movies.  She even requested I see all the MWMNBN movies prior to taking her to see the finale.  We chatted about the decor.  Something was amiss and I asked her if BOC was an accurate representation of the MWMNBN.  She stated it contained \"elements.\"  The coffee eventually arrived. The tables remained occupied and a line had formed.  Without delay we were on our way.  I took a sip and found the latte to be super sweet.  I had been previously advised the size contained three shots of espresso. I never felt caffeines glorious effects.  I think I will just wave my wizard stick, cast a spell, and forget the whole thing.",

Don't get me wrong, it's a nicely decorated, and it's a trendy cafe spot like all cafe's these days but it just wasn't as innovative with the theme as I thought it was going to be from the videos and pictures on social media.  Literally looked at the menu and no word play or even trying to resemble the magical world. So ordered a iced tea because it is Nevada and summer. Lol it was good.  Conclusion: You're not missing out on anything but it is a good place to do work and if you need a cafe this is a place to go.",

While the pricing is higher than most, the atmosphere and quality of drinks and food makes up for it. The baristas were super helpful with recommendations of drinks and differences when comparing one drink to another. Definitely pick up some avocado toast too while you're here - that was my favorite part!",

I love Harry Potter and the references and decor are subtle enough that you could bring your muggle friends and they might be none the wiser!   For how intimate the space is, it doesn't feel cramped when it's busy. It's packed with students studying and folks working remote (like me!). The counter is easy to find and the staff was really nice.  I ordered their cold brew which I wasn't a fan of. It was really bitter like it had steeped for too long. I normally drink it black but I asked the gentleman behind the bar for some creamer and he was very accommodating. They rotate the beans for this, so perhaps I might like it on another visit. Noted for next time. My colleague ordered the Butter Brew latte but added a shot of espresso. It's a specialty drink but more like a steamer since it's steamed milk with butterscotch. It was sweet, delicious, but not my cup of coffee.  We split the Charmingly Pesto sandwich and it was a hit for us both. Lots of flavor, super meaty, well put together. I acciod that right into my belly.",

The small tables have different cute sayings like Caffeine Managed, etc. play on Harry Potter quotes and coffee. There's music playing but still a good place to study or meet up with friends.  I got the roasted almond latte that has almond bits on the bottom. It's a bit strong, comes with 3 shots of espresso, I would opt for 2 next time. My fiance got the butterbrew latte which has no espresso but you can add. Both were good and were around $5 each for a large. The butterbrew tastes like the butterbeer that they have at Universal Studios!   Atmosphere is chill and the coffee is good. I would definitely come back when I'm back in the area!",

They also have a beer menu (fyi)   Tons of different seating for the interior from a center bar to tables + chairs.  Since it is in Henderson, I wouldn't make my way out specifically for this place, but if I were in the area I'd be down to try something else on the menu.   If it were close enough, it'd be a chill place to get some studying done !",

I am a huge Harry Potter fan, and I absolutely love how they pay homage to the franchise. The tables have magical sayings on them, and there's various decorations throughout the shop, such as a sorting hat and bookshelf with all the books. Right now, there's even a Christmas tree and dementors with Santa hats on them. The bathrooms also have a \"this way to the Ministry of Magic\" decals on them.  My favorite drink - well, really the only drink I've tried - is the Butterbrew Frap. I definitely need to try the rest of the things on the menu, though, because it all sounds absolutely amazing.  If you're a fan of the HP franchise, you will appreciate it here. It's the perfect spot for a first date, catching up with friends, or studying.   I'll definitely be returning!",

My husband and I stopped in to check out the \"Harry Potter Coffee Shop\" as everyone calls it. We were excited but also skeptical that the hype had perhaps gotten our hopes up a bit too high. Well, the latter was the case.   Although the decor did not disappoint the witch in me, the actual product was sub-par. The famed Butter-beer flavored drink was more caramel than anything else and the nitro brew was just, okay. We waited a very long time for our drinks and we were the only ones waiting, which seemed odd.   Other than that, there is a very small amount of seating in the place, and usually it's populated by teenagers (understandably so).   I would say, check this place out for yourself if you are a major Harry Potter but, but if you could take or leave the Wizarding World theme, I would possibly head somewhere else.",

Located in a bustling shopping center, this cool little coffee shop serves up a mean cup of caffeine while giving the inner geek in you something to gawk at while you're waiting for your drink. It's not over the top with decorations, but they things they do have are pretty clever: flying mail above, dementors propped up near the ceiling (not sure if it was because it was Halloween or if they have these year round), and even a little Platform 9 photo op.  Aside from the cool decor, the coffee itself was really good and the staff were really friendly. My only gripe was that when we ordered some drinks to go, they put the cold lids made for whipped cream on top, and those aren't the best from preventing spillage while you're driving!  Lots of tables inside and free wi-fi if you're trying to get some work/studying done. I'd definitely recommend to check out and you're in the area!",

I had high expectations of this Harry Potter themed coffee shop, and expected to be spirited away with wizardry magicalness. Instead, I was mostly underwhelmed with the sparse Potter knick-knacks strewn about the coffee shop. The theme just wasn't executed as well as I had hoped.   But let's not forget about the coffee! I went with a sea salt iced coffee, which was pretty good but comparable to a typical iced coffee offered by any other coffee shop. My husband went with the nitrogen cold brew, and said it was just OK. The macaroons we tried were great, but definitely on the pricey side for the minuscule size of these tasty treats.   The only issue with the service regarded the Yelp check-in offer for 20% off iced drinks. The cashier said the offer wasn't valid for our order (even though I ordered an iced drink), but decided to honor the deal anyways. This wasn't really doing us a solid since the offer clearly stipulated it was applicable to iced drinks. Whatever.   I'm glad I checked this off my to-do list, but I don't think Bad Owl warrants a return visit.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2016: #66",

With our purchase of coffee, we asked if we could all also get cups of water, you'd think she'll remember that, but we had to get up and ask for the cups of water again. Once MORE, we had to suffer her snooty attitude. This made us feel uncomfortable even more AND WE'RE THE PAYING CUSTOMERS AND IT SHOULD NOT BE LIKE THAT. After the good experience that we had here yesterday, this girl was ready to ruin that for us. But we were not going to allow Sue to ruin a good day. We did some running around today with the little sister from San Diego and after we found ourselves in need of some relaxation from the day's shenanigans, we decided to come again.  There are more patrons here today and the music being played is from a vast of selections. The Harry Potter theme is a good touch & so different from the typical cafe decors around town. It's still a good place to visit IF SUE WERE NOT WORKING HER SHIFT WHEN YOU ARRIVE.  Apart from the unhappy service that Sue gave us, it's still a good experience, although that little issue could be easily remedied by teaching Sue to be happier.",

I had the almond milk latte, which you have to ask for \"expresso\" for coffee?? Its a latte? Shouldnt it already be coffee?? I didnt like it much. My mom ordered butter beer latte no \"expresso\" which tasted just like butterscotch.  The main dissapointment was the size of the cup for how much you pay. A \"regular\" cup is the same size as starbucks mini extra small cup. Thats rediculous for $5!!! I can go to starbucks and get a grande for the same price for more coffee and it tastes better!

I tried the Lavender Latte and ordered it in a mug and was so pleasantly surprised when it was brought to my table--a perfect rosetta poured by the barista, Luke. The milk was steamed just right: not too frothy and velvety smooth. The flavor of the lavender sort of reminded me of a dirty chai latte... aromatic but not overbearing or overly sweet. The atmosphere of the cafe was great and the whole staff was friendly and helpful even though it was a busy Saturday afternoon. Don't let the Harry Potter theme fool you-- Bad Owl Coffee means business. Definitely coming back!",

    "text": "Best Coffee Shop in Henderson/Las Vegas!  I have been to tons of coffee shops locally and they are all basically the same, with the exception of Bad Owl.  First their egg sandwich is actually made onsite. Unlike StarB's where everything is pre-packaged or so many others where they microwave the egg.  Bag Owl actually cooks the egg.  Probably the best egg sandwich I have ever had outside of my own home.  Next the drinks my friend had a latte and I had the chai tea both were amazing.  The chai tea at StarB's is tasteless unless you add a flavor to it  The Bad Owl's chai actually has a cinnamon flavoring that was subtle and enjoyable to drink.  The customer service rocks! The two young ladies behind the counter were friendly and spot on with their service. I live 17 minutes away from the Bad Owl but am willing to drive for great customer service, tasty chai and an amazing egg sandwich!",

Not that I'm against that. Some tables needed clearing up, but they were very busy so I don't hold it against them. If you're looking for a quaint coffeehouse, this won't satisfy your need.

The food was delicious, but considering that we basically got two waffles and a sandwich; that's just too much money.  The signature drinks, were underwhelming to say the least.  There was a small list of signature lattes and two signature drinks... that's it.  I would have expected everything to be Harry Potter inspired, but it wasn't.  Finally, the decor was ok, but I really think they missed the mark.  This could have been a whole experience, like instead of walking through the front door, you could walk through a phone booth or fireplace as you're \"transported\" into the cafe.  The coffee bar could have been made up like the \"burrow;\" cobbled together cabinets and such.  The tables kind of ramshackle like you'd find in the Hogshead.  Instead, half of the decorations looked like recycled Halloween decorations.  Pros: Food was Great Cons: The signature drinks, lack of inspiration to include the food and decor, and the price.",

    "text": "I finally managed to go here with my siblings after a student-worker gave me a heads-up about this Harry Potter-themed coffee spot opened up.  We went around 10am, and that was a decent amount of time before the place got crowded around 11am. Not kidding - there was a line from the register to the front door.  The staff was all friendly, but you can tell that everyone was still trying to find a groove, especially when business picked up. Really patient too like when you're trying to decide what to order or need a flavor recommendation. Of course, I thought the setting was cute and appropriate. As for the food... Definitely liked the Apricot Croissant/Danish, the chips that came with the siblings' breakfast sandwiches. The sister had this Roast Beef sandwich (Rosemary Foccacia bread with an Aioli spread), and that was yummy. Definitely enjoyed the bread. The brother had this kinda Ham and Cheese, and our fave part was the Artichoke Hearts and Tomatoes.  Drinkwise, we would definitely drive 5 minutes away from the Starbucks in the same plaza to come here. I had a Biscoff Latte that tasted exactly like the cookie! The brother enjoyed his Matcha Latte, and my sister honestly liked their Lavender Latte. Next time, I'll give their Butterbeer Latte a try, even though it doesn't have a shot of espresso.",

    "text": "Went here with my 11 year old son, yesterday. We were recommended to go here as we were waiting for his code class to start that is a couple of doors down from this place.  We walk in and I notice how the lighting is a little dim but comfortable. Before we order, I escort my son to the rest room and he is in awe of the place for some reason, that I am oblivious to.  He goes into the bathroom, which is only for a single person at a time. This goes for the women's bathroom, as well. Then I hear him through the door, \"Oooooh...! I get it...!\" As he comes out he says, \"Dad, this place is Harry Potter themed...! Get it, \"Bad Owl\"...?\" His excitement is due to him being a Harry Potter fan as he completed reading and watching the movie series a month ago. (Clever)  The decor is brilliant and their versatile menu is just as surprising, as well. They have a really good food and wine menu on top of their coffee menu. One of the wines that I noticed that they serve is one of the popular Pinot Noir wines out there: Meiomi. (Legit)  We look through the menu and see the various waffles, lava cakes and sandwiches  that they serve and other items, but decided to go with their grilled cheese, The Wizard Melt. It is served on rye with parm , mozzarella and a mild cheddar. What intrigued me most about the grilled cheese was that it also had avocado inside of it! It also came with a delicious small side salad. Nice consistency and transition of the crunch on the outside of the bread transitioning to it getting softer as you bite more into the sandwich. Not overly gooey, the guac was a very nice compliment to the rye and cheese.  I was delightful and a very welcomed surprise.  I am not a coffee drinker but will give it a try next time I am in, but what I read from the reviews was that it is pretty good.  My review on the food is a cross between health conscious mixed with some sin to it. The Blueberry Almond Butter Toast  and maybe one of the lava cakes that they serve is something that I do want to try when we come back.  The service was great! The staff were polite and personable.  There is free WiFi, as well.  Definetly looking forward to coming back, but I think my son is looking forward to it more.",

If you know Harry Potter then you will definitely recognize all the accents throughout the shop. Platform 9 6/8, dementors, letters from Hogwarts, writing on the tables, etc. It still feels like a cool coffee shop if you aren't an HP fanatic, which I appreciate. The inside is dark and has lots of wood accents to give it a cool vibe. There are small and large tables to accommodate all sizes of groups.   They have a wide variety of food and drink available. Mojito coffee? They have it. v60 brews? Check. Protein pucks and pastry snacks? Of course! The staff was very friendly and patiently waited for our group to order. I had the v60 coffee since I'm a big fan. It was decently priced and tasted good, but not great. The mojito drink has mint leaves in it, which my friend did't enjoy since it was difficult to drink with them inside. Every now and then a whole mint leaf would end up in the straw. If you love mint, it's your drink. If not, I suggest you try one of the other various menu items!",

Tried the Lavender Latte and it was really really good!  They made regular whip cream just for my drink and it too was yummy.   Tried the Avocado Toast and it was really good. I haven't tried avocado with egg before and I am STILL craving this toast 4 days later. Shared the order with a friend so we each had a slice. It was really good and I may have to pop in this weekend for another.   Overall I enjoyed Bad Owl.

Decor: if you're into the rustic wood, industrial pipe etc... you will love this place. I am not sure how often they start their cold brew but when we were there they started a new brew and it is very cool to watch whether you have seen ice cold coffee brewing or not. And if you're Harry Porters fan, it is a plus to check this out, I am not (sorry!) Caffeine: they have a variety of exotic coffee. Some of them take between 4 to 24 hours to brew; including cold brew. I was working my way down the coffee menu starting with V60. Others include Kyoto Cold Brew, Nitrogen Cold brew and Barista Cold Brew. The barista gave me a small cup of Nitrogen Cold Brew and I LOVE it, my fiance is not a coffee drinker and she loves it... that is something.  Simple menu: I am not a big fan of a huge menu that takes hours to navigate through. But don't mistake it for not having enough to choose from.  Hospitality: the barista took time to explain me the different type of brewing they have. Knowing that I love coffee, he even suggested a few places closer to where we live since I stated that this coffee shop is a bit far for us. Yet, I don't think it will stop us from coming as my fiance loves it and she does not like most coffee shops. If she picks this coffeeshop over a boba shop to go to study, you have to check it out.   Update: while we are still here studying/working, the barista brought out sample of the Kyoto Cold Brew and Ice Cold Brew for us to try (thank you!). If you love the acidic in your coffee, this your type. I feel like the Kyoto is bit more earthy. I still love the Nitrogen more, it feels really smooth... like dark beer. I know it is a strange comparison but you just have to try it and love it.",

    "text": "I have no idea what to say, they said they were open. So I drove all the way across town only to find a note on the door saying they won't be there until 2pm. Let's get this straight, you open a new business, and you go and do something else without having a staff there to take care of customers while you do this news thing. I find it inconvenient and unprofessional in a way. I could see that a good business practice is to keep to your schedule, have a staff to handle your regular business hours, and do these special events with other staff. It's not cool!   Now, if I get to come back this way, all the way across town, we will see what this is like. But for now, I think it was a very unprofessional move on your part. Be better equipped to serve the public during and always during the hours you say you are open. I wasted my time to visit your shop, and you can't have the decency to be open as your hours clearly state online, that's the bit that sucks and you probably don't care enough to see my point. But, I'm not the only person who drove in and was in the parking lot, waking up you our doors to see the same note. We all should have walked up to experience the hype of your shop with a staff there, not closed.",

It was amazing!!! Id recommend this place to any one any age, it has something for you.  I cant wait to go back. I live on the opposite side of Vegas and the drive is well worth it!",

What I didn't like much was the service..  I came here with my younger brothers and they don't drink coffee. My 8 year old orders a butterbeer with just milk and I swore it had coffee.. Tasted like it and it was brown. I asked the barista and cashier 3 times and they kept saying.. No it doesn't have coffee. They finally made me a new one they said \"just in case\" and the new drink's color was white! The first one they gave us was brown, they saw it too because you put the lid.. I really didn't appreciate them lying about it the first place, especially when I asked multiple times if they're sure there's no coffee.. Obviously they knew because the color was different . The butterbeer flavoring is clear and it's just milk base. My brother has ADD and it was 8pm.. No way I was giving that kid some coffee.   Either way, it's not a coffee place I'll go to unless my friends from out of state want to go visit. It's a cute place with pastries and a good amount of flavored coffee.",

So anyway! Obviously, if you LOVE Harry Potter you should visit this place off the bat. The interior decorations did not disappoint.   But I must say, the music selection was throwing me off. since a lot of coffee shops play similar genres, I came into this shop and thought, \"oh, that's different.\" It was jusomething you wouldn't normally hear at a coffee shop. lol It was no biggie though. Just my own little observation. I only came for the theme of the shop & most importantly to see what their signature drinks were all about!   I ordered a Butter Beer Latte with espresso. One of the staff members would come out and call your name to hand off your drink which is nice.. Especially when it gets a little busy/loud. The drink was ok, but that's about all I can say, lol.   As I sat with my friends, I realized a few people.. Not one, but, a few customers were complaining about their drinks being bland. Hmm.. Not a good sign. But the nice part was that they fixed it and made the drinks with adjustments to the customers' liking.   This shop is definitely eye catching with their decorations and theme. But as far as drinks go, I feel they might need some work.. Or I just need to try more drinks lol.",

We even skipped our morning brew at home and waited until 8am for them to open shop.  Sadly, when we got to the counter, we were greeted with \"I'm so sorry, we ran out of Kyoto but can I get you something else?\"  Seriously?!  I mean... ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!!  You just opened!  The pastries display case was empty too... hmmm...   By looking at the reviews -- looks like this place is always running out of one thing or another.  I get it if I'm going into a coffee shop late in the evening and everything is sold out but this is first thing in the morning!  We love to support small businesses, but this is Unbelievable & Unacceptable!  Help Us, Help You!  Carry products that you're advertising!  It's as simple as that, right?  :-(    Maybe I shouldn't have waited until 8am for my caffeine fix... Bad Owl-- BAD!  :-(   SMH.",

Initially you taste coffee/espresso and then as the drink cools the Lavendar comes through. It's the perfect combo of coffee-lavendar. Want the Lavendar to come through even stronger? Cut out the espresso or add Lavendar. Simple. 10 out of 10.  As for my FAVORITE drink: the Pistachio Latte!!!! Holy smokes this drink is delicious.  It smells like a sweet desert. It's so aromatic. I wish I could capture the smell in a candle. ((((Heaven))))   Harry Potter Fan, Dr. Who Fan or not You have to check this place out. Their menu will have something that you'll like/love.   Lastly, their desserts and pasteries are to die for. The macaroons, chocolate croissants, chocolate swirl croissant and the almond croissant are AmaZing. Fresh daily!!!!  Give this place a try! You'll return. :)  To the staff- you guys rock! Keep up the good work.",

Credits to yelp ha. :) This place is really really close to where I live, to a hospital and to a lot of restaurants so that's a plus. Also, if you love Harry Potter then you MUST go here! It's cozy inside. Such a nice place to study,organize your planner,read and/or whatever it is you need to work on, you can do it here! First time I came here I was greeted by two friendly baristas and decided to get the BUTTER BEER LATTE and CHICKEN PESTO SANDWICH. Food and drink were both bomb although the Coffee didnt make me feel buzzed lol jk! I had the lavender latte and mint mojito the following days. For the mint mojito, they put fresh ground mint with whatever amount of espresso you want so you could really taste that minty flavor. However, I think my fave is the lavender latte. Well because you know you gotta have one fave drink right lol ;) P.S if you check in, you get 20% off your entire bill :) uhhhmmm yes of course I recommend this place and Im actually going back tomorrow for my morning coffee hehe!",

I recently tried the nutella latte and it was actually very good. Not too sweet. I dislike extremely sweet coffee.

When I ordered a drink and didn't like it, they let me switch it out for another one for no problem. The staff is really friendly and the service is really quick.

    "text": "What attracted me to this place first was the name and logo.  I love all things owl!  After doing some light research I see that's it's a Harry Potter themed place.  Being a \"light\" Potter fan myself, I've become even more intrigued.    I check out the menu, hmm.... interesting...  I must say it was a great idea to come in.  It's decorated nicely.  Like a dark comfy cafe.  The theme is subtle enough that you may not even notice if you're not in the know.  The coffee was great.  Probably the best lavender latte I've had as of late.  I ALWAYS order a lavender latte if it's on the menu.  The everything avocado toast was great as well.  It was beautiful and tasty.  Rich but served with a lime to cut that richness.  Toast, toasted perfectly.    The service was good.  Accommodating and friendly.  The food came out a little slow but everyone in front of me ordered food so...   I just wish this place was closer to where I live.  Well worth the trek though.",

The atmosphere is perfection: you can't go wrong with a Harry Potter theme. Their drinks are a little pricey, but so worth it. I without fail get my Biscoff Latte every week which is made with cookie butter. I have tried their sandwiches and their avocado toast and they are delicious. Their music playlists are always on point, ranging from oldies and classics to pop punk to hip hop. Highly recommend!!!",

    "text": "Super cute place with a great vibe.   Until you meet the barista who will look at you like you're speaking Greek if you ask for a regular coffee. \"We don't DO regular coffee here.\" She directs me to a menu of expensive specialty coffees.   \"Well, I really just want a basic coffee... like a light roast or breakfast blend. What's the closest thing you have to that?\"   Another long pause like I'm speaking Mandarin. And then she says, in a very slow, condescending voice as if I'm a complete idiot...  \"Ya... like I said, we don't DO regular coffee here. The closest we have is Americano.\"   Ok cool, I'll try that for $4. Because there's literally nothing cheaper and I'm not looking for a latte.   Next question: Do you guys have Stevia (sort of a staple at higher end coffee shops)? \"No, just what you see in front of you.\"  Alright then, we can do sugar today in our expensive Americano.   Sit down at our tiny table to get some work done and realize, it's sweltering hot in there. 95 degrees outside and if the air conditioning is on it's not working.   Then realize the internet connection is so slow it's barely usable.   After 10 minutes of sweating, struggling with slow internet, and then being serenaded by barista  - who is now singing loudly behind the coffee bar - we give up and head to Starbucks.   Barista watches us pack up and makes eye contact as we leave without acknowledging us at all. No \"thanks for stopping by\" or \"come again.\" And this shop is tiny, almost awkward to walk out without saying something.   Really wish I could say I enjoyed this place because I love finding new places to chill and work other than Buckies... but other than the decor, Bad Owl is a hard no for me.",

    "text": "In a nutshell: Hipster coffee place. Good latte, really yummy food. Overpriced.   Latte was a bit above average. Good temperature, flavor, ratios of milk to flavor to espresso. Ordered two different Latte's, one was the Lavender latte. Lavender flavor was nonexistent and \"milk\"was the overall flavor of the drink. Disappointed on that one. Other Latte was good. Could've been a bit hotter. Nothing to compel me to return. Also ordered a BLT and another sandwich. Both were excellently prepared and presented nicely. Bacon was thick, crispy and cooked perfectly. Veggies were fresh. Came with a side \"salad,\" i.e. lettuce greens.   Food was a hit. Coffee was just above average. Real happening place for hipsters if you're into that.   Clean, lively atmosphere. Plenty of seating, some seating is a communal large tables. Baristas in a very good mood, seem to love what they're doing. Nice workers, pretty average wait time for coffee. Food took a bit longer to come out. Was 75% done with coffee by the time food arrived.   Not enough positives for me to return. Not a \"bad\" experience, just didn't check all the boxes for a repeat visit.   $32, two Latte, two sandwiches and 20% tip and tax",

The location is in the same plaza as the El Pollo Loco and a few other places and was definitely not that hard to find. Parking space is a bit tight too but I found a spot right in front.  The establishment is a bit more spacious than I thought it would be - there are tables both in and out and two high table with plenty of seating. Harry Potter decorations everywhere! If you love HP I would definitely recommend coming here, even if you just want to grab a quick bite to eat! I also recommend coming here to study, it's very quiet and they have WiFi and outlets! (And a bathroom if you need to go!)  There are a selection of items on the menu such as sandwiches, espresso flights, teas, waffles, and even WINE! I gave up drinking coffee a few months ago so I was kind of sad that I wasn't able to try how good their espresso drinks are! Luckily they had teas and other non-coffee drinks such as Butterbrew, Chai, and Matcha. I asked the two employees which they preferred.. chai vs. matcha. And I decided to go with the Chai! I did not get their names but I was told that they make their chai in-house so I was excited to try it out. The drink came out quick and I loved it! It was very cinammon-y.   My friend and I were there for a while and we moved from the inside tables to outside and the employees were nice enough to check up on us and also bring us some waters.   I cannot wait to come back and study and also try their waffles!",

The time it took was nearing 30 minutes, so I opted to have it as take out instead. The very busy worker was great about changing this up for me. I enjoyed it later at the airport (somehow made it), and it was charmingly good indeed. I had also ordered the *Lavender Latte*. Mild on the lavender, but creamy and enjoyable. It was busy so the latte art was rushed, but that's no biggie.   You could say that this shop is a tourist trap since it is Harry Potter themed and very grabby for those just coming from the airport or on their way there (like me). They don't seem to have their Butterbrew latte anymore or at least they didn't when I popped in. In fact, the only Harry Potter themed coffee product was their 'Flight of the Hippoglyph' which was like a flight of 3-4 espresso shots, so nope. It should be noted that their 'Kyoto' cold brew was very recommended. It's brewed for 16 hours and supposedly very strong. I'd say check it out, but make sure you have a lot of time on your hands.",

(The cafe boasts a pretty decent selection of wines and food as well if you're not much of a tea or coffee drinker.)   I ordered the smallest size of the Butter Brew iced latte and the Belgium waffles ($9) with Butter Brew cream ($5). The waffles comes with a tiny cup of butter, two cups of maple syrup, and a cup of one scoop of vanilla ice cream. As for my final verdict, the latte was alright and the waffles were quite good. You have the option to add espresso to your latte -which I said yes to- and it was a bad choice to pair it with the waffles. Once I had the waffles and then took sips from my latte, boyyy was it bitter! One of my friends had the Pistachio latte ( and I wanted to steal her drink instead.  All in all, my friends and I had a wonderful time. There's a high chance that we'll be coming back :-)",

I definitely have more drinks to try, but one of the girls told me her fave drink is a mocha with some lavender. So, I decided to try it out. I love lavender, so I had to do it. She convinced me...sorta. lol. I need to go back for the matcha!   Anyway, it wasn't too bad. The lavender mocha was pretty good. 10 POINTS TO...the girl are the cashier for recommending. Heh heh.  Also tried my brother's pastry, and it was pretty decent too. Nothing to rave too much about.   The ambiance is pretty legit. I wanted to bring my wand with me when I went, but I think that's too much. So I wore my big, black \"witch\" hat. (I was having a bad hair day) There was, of course, references to everything harry potter. From platform 9 3/4 with the cart and the owl to each table having something engraved about the movie or characters.   I need to come back and try some of their signature drinks. I just wish it wasn't on the edge of the earth. So far!",

It's quirky, but apart from the telephone box in the corner, it works.  So why 3 stars and not more? Well, as a frequent visitor I lament to the servers about the poor quality of their pastries. They shrug their shoulders and do sweet FA. Well, that maybe unfair...it isn't quality it's more selection. I mean, what the hell are French beignets doing in a Harry Potter cafe? Where are the scones? Where are the oatmeal bars...the morning glory muffins? C'mon good people, stop inflicting this poor selection on your customers. It's just not good enough.  Here's the deal...I could become a more frequent customer but choose not to precisely for this reason. After all, there's only so much avocado toast I can consume in a week. And I don't always feel like eating a hunking  slice of bread. So I don't visit more regularly. I go elsewhere for slightly worse coffee but much better pastries. How much brain power does it take to fix this? With all those fucking wands on the wall you'd think it could be done really quickly. If this was Kansas it would be solved in two clicks of my ruby shoes.",

As much as I wanted to check this place out as soon as it opened, I didn't want to deal with the lines that everyone complained about. But I also wanted to get here before it shut down for copyright infringement.  I immediately went for the iced butter \"brew\" latte (looks like they already switched the name from butter beer) and my fiance got the white forest latte with sea salt cream. I didn't add the espresso in my drink so it was basically a delicious milky butterscotch drink which I was fine with. His drink tasted just like eating a forest cake, so being able to drink a cake was amazing.   Besides being a Harry Potter fan, I love the dark decor. I want to decorate my house with all the rustic furniture they have here.  I'm more of a tea drinker so next time I'll explore that part of the menu.",

    "text": "Harry Potter + Local grounds + Nerd Culture = A whimsical caffeinated adventure.   Bad Owl is a great new coffee shop located in Henderson and to be honest we really needed a dedicated coffee brewing spot that wasn't a Starbucks. With Mothership Coffee Roasters far down the road and Tangerine cafe being more like a lunch cafe, having a dark unique coffee spot is just what the neighborhood needed.  If you're a lover Harry Potter you will most likely get a solid magic wand as you as you walk-in and see the decor, it's set up like the train station (Platform 934) that and Harry and crew descend upon when heading to Hogwarts. Faux bricks, \"Hedwig\" the owl, and random stacks of luggage can be found in this place along with a great coffee bar and sweet some snacks.   This spot keeps it local with coffee from Colorado Coffee Roasters and has all of the coffee shop favorites; espresso, lattes, iced coffee and even some nitro brew on tap. But when you come to Bad Owl Coffee you need to get something off the specialty menu, how about a Butter Beer Latte with an extra shot, yes please. This is a very smooth latte that doesn't have an insane sweet taste and is a great coffee option for someone, like myself, looking for a lightly sweetened and very creamy hot coffee drink. They also have a slew of other unique beverages...  - Lavender Lattes w/ house made lavender - Spanish Latte w/ Sweet cream and espresso - Mint Mojito Latte w/ mint leaves muddled into sweet and creamy milk - Cookie butter latte made with real cookie butter  You get the point!   Free Wi-Fi, tabletops covered in spells, and a chill vibes. I'm in! - Sippius, Slurpius, Maximo!",

Well, being total Harry Potter fans, my daughter and I stopped by yesterday and saw there was only a couple people in line. Totally geeking out over the cute Harry Potter themed tables, we ordered an iced lavender latte and butter beer latte. The lavender latte was floral and sweet, but a little too much for me. The butter beer latte was heavily sweet, thick and like a decadent dessert. Tasty, but a whole one might be too much for me.  The decor is not too gimmicky as I thought it might be, I was happily surprised, superbly executed with wizardly flair.",

    "text": "If you want to be under the spell of premium coffee in a charming themed coffee shop, visiting the Bad Owl is a wise decision. If you are my Yelp friend, you are aware by my check ins and reviews that I am usually under the spell of coffee. In the past couple of weeks I had been following the updates on this Harry Potter themed coffee shop that was opening on Saturday, February 13, 2016 in the Kmart themed shopping center at the northwest corner of Eastern Avenue at Horizon Ridge Parkway in Henderson.      Right off the bat, the Bad Owl is wise to location location location. It is a chirp away from spectacular restaurants including Blaze Pizza. As I drove into the shopping center I noticed that the Bad Owl already has the Green Mermaid as a nemesis. When I drove by the empty pod near Arby's, I saw \"Coming Soon Starbuck's.\"  With that said, the Bad Owl will have to have a good spirit to share the limelight with Starbuck's. From today's experience, I spent a couple of hours under the spell of a good owl.       Today was the official Grand Opening of the Bad Owl and my day off. I could afford to be indolent and spend a couple of hours here. I'd enjoy a Roasted Almond Late then a drip coffee with butterscotch syrup.      When I walked into the relatively small shop, the Grand opening scene was a laid back pandemonium. There was a line that twisted around to the entrance of a room bordered by grey brick walls around a wood colored floor. It felt like I was in an event where the community was celebrating the newest coffee shop. When I waited in this line, I was more optimistic than impatient. I was disheartened when the nearby Galaxy Coffee shut down, and was becoming optimistic that the local coffee shops could coexist with the chains. If I had gone online when I was on line, I would read that in the summer that Bad Owl plans to add craft beer and wine to their menu (Barnes & Nobles is considering the same move).      The theatre of the Harry Potter theme kept the customers and yours truly entertained. I am not really a Harry Potter fan but a fan of imagination and animals including owls. Inside this room of imagination my eyes roamed toward the large Bad Owl logo over the tables to the right, to the Owl statue in a cage placed on a tower of suitcases in platform 9 1/3, and toward the back chairs arranged around a display of Harry Potter books. This theatre of Harry Potter theming transformed me from Henderson, Nevada to Great Britain.      There wasn't a sleepy moment in the Bad Owl. The caffeineated beverages kept me awake despite the fact the dim lighting could put me asleep if I was enjoying wine in the later hours. Just like an owl, Mad Owl is open later than many of its competitors. The roasted almond late that kept me up, was delectable. It is nice to know that I know of another spot besides E Cafe in Fashion Show to appreciate caffeineated almond based late drinks. By the time, I revisited the counter for a drip coffee with butterscotch syrup, there were far less people near the Owl statue. Around 5 pm the pandemonium died down. This was stamp two on my card that could lead to a complimentary beverage. There was a moderate delay from time of order to when the batista delivered it to the chair. I exchanged lost time for a freshly made delicious cup of Boyd  coffee.       As I walked from the back two plush chairs around the display of Harry Potter books toward the exit, I passed the long counter with the orange hanging lamps to the right and a display case that will present a sundry of desserts in the future then the two long common tables; and toward the left I passed a half dozen circle tables engraved with Harry Potter sayings and the charismatic owl statue. By the time I left the door and looked toward Kmart, I had the feeling that I will be revisiting the exact scenery. Delicious Coffee and imagination create an OWLsome spell to be under for a couple of hours.",

I think playing the soundtrack would be a fun touch, but that might be overkill. Service was friendly and I like the fun menu options for butterbeer, lavender, pistachio, and grapefruit-ginger flavored lattes. They also have a pour over and nitro cold brew options for those who fancy themselves coffee purists.   I tried the iced mint mojito latte and found it less strong and more milky than I'd expected- didn't quite hit the spot for my Philz craving, but will definitely pop by again to see how they improve as they settle in. Oh, and no need to use your Wingardium Leviosa spell- they'll bring your drink to your table when it's ready!  They currently have a few pastry options and croissants to munch on, hoping they add a food menu as time goes on: pumpkin pasties, anyone?! Mischief managed. ;)",

    "text": "My complaints about Henderson's poor quantity of local owned business have finally been heard! And we now have a new coffee shop in the area that's brewing a lot of attention  Setting: Located in the Kmart plaza on Horizon Ridge and Eastern, it is behind the jackinbox/bank by the pei wei. A sign on the outside that screams super cool, has an aesthetic treat for those interested in the dark arts, lightning bolt scars, and magic. HARRY POTTER THEMED! The interior is like a cocktail bar you'd find somewhere in diagon alley.   Service: I was greeted by a young guy during their soft opening who was cordial and very excited to be a part of this experience. A gentleman who brought my coffee to me, appeared to be the co-owner and was especially kind. Offering to bring me sugar, cream to my table, a back rub, but I had to decline.  Coffee: The main three blends to choose are sumatra, ethiopia, and brazil. I chose the Sumatra v60 which honestly is the best coffee i've ever had! You could really taste all the mild notes of blueberries with barely any acidity.   Drip: Your traditional coffee machine  V60: Is a type of pour over that achieves a faster brew utilizing a larger opening for water through the filter that requires steady pouring to achieve the desired flavors.  Aeropress: A device that supposedly yields coffee with smoother taste and lower bitterness by utilizing ideal water temperatures, and gentle air pressure.  Kyoto: A giant apparatus that utilizing ice and a much slower brewing process to filter out all the acidity from the oils of the coffee beans to bring out a much richer, acid free brew. (Not available when I was there)  Overall: This is a great place for people who can really appreciate unique brewing methods to bring out the best flavors of coffee. Not a place to study but more geared towards couples or groups wanting to just spend some time together.",

    "text": "I think I overhyped this in my head.   I ordered the Butter Brew Latte with a shot of espresso and the avocado toast.  Latte was pretty good.  Kinda sweet for my taste, but it was similar to the hot butterbeer at Universal, just with a shot of espresso in it.  Mine was kinda lukewarm which is a pet peeve of mine.  They plopped it on the counter with no lid on it then the lids they did provide were flimsy and popped off so the coffee spilled on my friend when she went to try it.    Avocado toast was almost superb BUT it was cold, the eggs were cooked improperly (the whites were runny and the yolks were hard even though it said they were sunny side up), and the avocado was stone cold (which is why the dish was overall cold).  I'm not about that improperly cooked egg life, but if they are hot I can usually let it slide.  Cold slimy eggs aren't my dig though.    Service is kind of bleh.  None of the employees knew what was going on and the layout of the store is inefficient: you order at the front of the store then all the way in the back an employee quietly calls out your name. Same for when your order your food only they half heartedly try to find you in the dining area.  Something needs to change there. The man who took my order was 100% disinterested in taking my order, which is fine, customer service is hard.   I guess I wanted a more magical experience but it was only just meh. If for whatever reason I'm in Henderson again, I don't think I'd go back.  Once was enough.",

    "text": "Major props to my husband for noticing this coffee shop last weekend while we were driving down Eastern. We decided to stop in yesterday and we were oblivious to the fact that this was the grand opening day. Whatever they've done to advertise is working because the place was packed. The line was to the door when we arrived and stayed that way until we left.  The shop is apparently Harry Potter themed. I didn't catch this at first since Harry Potter isn't my jam, but I like owls so I can appreciate that aspect. I liked the overall design of the shop and the colors they chose.   Even though the shop was crazy busy the staff was still very friendly and not acting frazzled. The woman handing out the prepared drinks was thanking everyone for their patience with the long wait.   The menu offers a nice variety of items. They have several offerings for True coffee devotees. The latte selection is impressive and they have some really unique flavors. The pistachio latte and lavender latte are what initially intrigued me enough to stop in. I'd love to return for tea as well because they have several delicious sounding tea concoctions. The pastry selection was limited yesterday, but I wonder if that was because they ran out of things with how busy they were.   I had an iced pistachio latte, passion fruit macaron, and caramel macaron. The pistachio flavor was very bold and required some heavy stirring to get the taste to be right, but overall it was a good drink. Both macarons had great flavor and the consistency was correct. It's rare that a macaron is the correct consistency so I really appreciated that the macarons were done right. My husband had an iced mint mocha which he really enjoyed. He said the mint was more subtle than other mint mochas he has had, but it was good.  I'll definitely be back to try more of the fun lattes and teas.",

It's all the way across town from where I live, so unless I was in that part of town, I wouldn't be going there regularly, but lots of looky-loos snapping pics when we were there. If I lived in that part of town, absolutely, I'd probably hang out there. The coffees and teas we tried were good, kind of like Starbucks, price wise too. We tried the waffle w/butter beer cream, that was a little overpriced at $9.95 for a belgian waffle w/ice cream and butterscotch whipped cream, but nice atmosphere and staff. They were wearing cute shirts that read \"coffee managed\" on the back.",

The entryway is adorned with a large curtain which I believe was a reddish color which gave me a feel of elegance. The Harry Potter theme was a nice touch because I enjoyed seeing something that was familiar to me and gave me a positive overall feeling. The size of the place is small and cozy decorated in a lot of warm wood tones and brown colors. The coffee was quite good and we thought it was even better than Starbucks. The pastries were fresh. We had several different types of bear claws and all of them were delicious. Everything was reasonably priced pastries were in the $3 range and the coffees were in the $4 range. The service was warm and friendly and they brought most of our items directly to our table. We got to meet the owners and they were both friendly and helpful. The location is really great as there's lots of other places to eat in the area as well as stores and shops. I would definitely recommend this place and we will definitely be coming back soon.",

Arrived about 830am and it was packed, i stood in line for roughly a hour, which if it was just a normal coffee shop, i would have never done. But there was something about this place that drove me to want to wait in line to get a cup of coffee.  Not sure if it was the theme of the place or the fact that they were so busy, and the fact that everyone was in a great mood even though the steady stream of people was never ending. Anyways, they have a great selection of coffees for a very reasonable price, the pastries are fabulous again the prices are well below what i was expecting. There was a total of 3 people in my party, we all got a large flavored coffees, (unfortunately they were out of the Butter Beer Latte) and a pastry, with 20% tip out there door it was $39, which was very reasonable in my mind. The establishment was very cozy for the amount of people waiting to be served as well as people that have been served. As long as they keep up the great customer service, keep the prices reasonable, i can see this place really taking off, because really who doesn't love anything to do with \"Harry Potter\"? What would make it even better is if they were playing the HP soundtracks instead of music, they should also, throw some TV's on the open walls and play on a constant loop all the different Harry Potter movies. We will definitely be going back, Gotta try that Butter Beer Latte!",

I ordered a sea salt nitro brew and egg croissant  & my gf got a coconut white mocha and the Munster cheese vegetarian wrap. The total after tax&tip was around $40 which is kinda expensive to be honest but that's not so much of an issue. The annoying part was the girl making the coffee. She yelled out in the Resturant \"who ordered the nitro brew?\" \"Who is Kevin, it's going to take a long time\". I got up went to the register and asked what the problem was and the cashier was kinda apologizing for her coworker acting unprofessional. So I offered to just take a normal coffee instead but the coffee girl just kept huffing and puffing like she was so burdened by the situation. I think regardless of the reason why she was annoyed she shouldn't act like a kid. It could have been a machine malfunction, the fact that it was actually busy, or just the fact she hates making that particular drink. The point is it doesn't matter why she was acting immature. She is at work and yelling and making the customers feel uncomfortable. Ruined the visit. And the nitro brew wasn't good at all if that matters. I won't mention her name because I think it's lame to throw someone under the buss like that but I hope she isn't there next time I go in.",

    "text": "We decided to take our 3 kids who all adore Harry Potter to the Bad Owl Cafe. It was cute and had nice touches from the books and movies. The kids loved pointing out all the decor and reading the quotes. The kids mentioned they wished they played Harry Potter music mixed in with the other music choices. The staff is very friendly and fast. Before we finished ordering 4 drinks my first order of the Biscoff latte was ready. It was very yummy. Slightly Sweet and smooth.  My husband got the iced Butter Brew..omg... delicious!! And perfect for kiddos with no espresso unless you ask for it to be added. My son got the decaf Iced Coconut White Mocha which was sweet and strong on the espresso side and daughter got the decaf Lavender Iced Latte. It was good but I couldn't taste the lavender at all. My little guy gobbled up his blueberry pastry and I didn't even get a taste but it looked scrumptious. All in all it was pretty good. We will be back again.",

Salted caramel macaron was okay.",

So the menu has soooo many choices, and my wallet wouldn't allow me to spend 6 bucks on iced coffee. So, I opted for the most talked about thing on the menu which was the Butter beer latte. I don't usually do the whole sweet coffee thing, but i was definitely happy with my choice. i feel as though the taste was spot on.. \"a little bit like less-sickly butterscotch\" JK would be proud. For being at the mercy of copyrights, I think they did an ok job of bringing the magic to life.  I've traveled for coffee before, I wouldn't put this place on that list.If i could find a reason to drive back out there believe me i'd give this place 4 stars. Maybe Firewhisky????",

The Harry Potter- ness was nothing more than some stenciled spells on tables and the famous 9 3/4 wall, but not much else. There is a cute nook with the books toward the back, but that's it. Where's the Harry Potter music?! Where's the Harry Potter themed uniforms?! I want MORE. If you're going to go themed, go all the way! There aren't many seats so it's not a place you can go to study. There is a large communal bench table which would probably be your best place to go unless you want people to give you dirty looks for taking up one of the limited tables. Also it's a little dark so if you're doing paper studying... eh. ALSO the two tables I sat at were WOBBLY. No way will I get any studying done at a wobbly table.  The coffee drinks were fun and good. If you have a friend in town (by town, I mean staying in Henderson- I wouldn't make the trip from the strip) by all means meet up for coffee here.  ALSO no poke stop here, bummer. :)",

Good music that's chill but upbeat (the Cure, Sam Cook, alt/indie rock plus other more eclectic classics). The Harry Potter theme is a creative and cute bonus that transports you out of real life.

No one should have to pay over $4 for a 12 oz lattee with no espresso. The waffles are just as, if not more ridiculous. A price for a waffle is $9.50. Even Tiabi isnt priced that high and they are famous for their waffles. For a little less than $10, we received a single belgium waffle.  It was far from special. The butter cream itself wasnt bad, but couldn't save them from their dense,  dry waffle and steep prices.   I try to support local coffee shops but Bad Owl needs to change their recipes to match their price point. There is no distinguishable taste between their biscoff ice latte, sea salt cream iced coffee, and regular latte other than watery and somewhat bitter and watey and bitter.   Luckily for them, I doubt they will lose business any time soon. People will come for the ambiance and minimal Harry Potter decor.  The establishment is clean. That is the only positive I can think of.",

My only complaint was that the service was kind of slow--line moves very slowly and the food took a long time to come out--so this is not the place to go for a quick coffee or meal. Also, it is pretty pricey. I guess part of what you pay for is the ambiance which is great.",

A mistake on my part as the line already reached the door and I had just bought cheese at the store that I wasn't willing to let melt for a latte. Since I don't live across town, it wasn't an issue to drive back. After looking at pictures of the line on Yelp, I realize now I avoided the worst of it.  Had an Iced Lavender Latte on both visits. The Lavender is strong, a stark contrast to the one I had at Sambalatte where I squinted my eyes wondering if there was even any Lavender in it at all. I remember telling the guy who works there I liked their syrup and appreciated how flavorful it was.   Even though I sometimes get coffee in the morning, I consistently get it at night which is why I haven't back since they posted on their social media they were closed at 5 (I tend to go after 7 because of dinner). I remember they initially advertised that they would be open til 10, but I haven't seen any post indicating they were changing their hours to be longer.   I hope they consider adding a 20/24 oz size because while 16oz is fine, I like to get my money's worth when I'm already putting $5 towards a drink after tax. Hope to also see the hours change back. I don't care if they close at 10, but even 7 or 8 would be great.",

    "text": "Coming here, there was so much hype because of it being Harry Potter themed. I ordered a lavender latte and no bit of lavender taste at all. The overall atmosphere of this coffee shop was lame. Nothing to spectacular. You could see behind the wallpaper. It didn't seem like it was put together very well. If I were to ever come back I would just order a regular coffee. To pay top dollar for a speciality coffee that isn't really special is a waste! Out of all the coffee shops in Las Vegas, this one is not on my list for recommendations.   The staff was nice and they got the order out in a quick fashion. Just not impressed by this place at all. If they made the speciality coffee more flavorful that could make a difference. They really tried to make the place look as authentic as possible... to the point where it wasn't at all.   Overall bummed about this place.",

    "text": "To start off, this cafe is a little bit too overhyped. Even as a Harry Potter fan, I was disappointed. Service was great when it comes to seeing smiling faces, but a let down when it came to honesty. My friend asked what were the best drinks and all the cashier could say was all of them were really good. We understand that as a worker you need to sell the products of your place, but we wanted an honest answer.   My friend decided to get the Mint Mojito Latte because the cashier said that it was her favorite. It tasted terrible. The Mint Mojito was basically just strong expresso with mint leaves. Literally, mint leaves. The taste of both items mixed together was so strong and it didn't blend well. None of my friends liked the drink, even those who love mint flavored things.  The second drink we got was the Almond Latte. This drink was slightly better than the Mint Mojito but it wasn't the best. You don't taste the almond flavor at all in your latte until you're crunching the tiny bits of almond in your mouth. It didn't bother us that there was almond chunks, it bothered us that the almonds and latte didn't blend well either.  Lastly, I decided to try the Butterbrew Latte, which is what most yelpers recommend. In my opinion, this is the best drink we tried all night, and my friends thought so too. The nice thing about this latte is that you can get it with or without the expresso. Without the expresso, it basically tastes like milk tea. The only problem I had with my drink was that about 3/4 of my cup was filled with ice, so I didn't feel like I got my money's worth. Unlike the first two drinks I mentioned, this drink uses butterscotch syrup for flavoring.   Overall, this is a decent place but I will not return unless I crave for some Butterbrew Latte. This cafe tries to be different by using real ingredients rather than syrup or powder but most of those drinks end up tasting bad.  Service is okay and the wait isn't long if you go at night.",

Considering that Yelpers have clearly felt a certain kind of way about the wait, I will say 1st that my husband and I walked in at 1:44 and sat down at 1:56 with our coffee and tea. Also, yes it is a Harry Potter theme however NO, it's not overdone. I think that it's just enough for those to enjoy, who don't necessarily care for Harry Potter but enjoy a quality coffeehouse. It is also enough if you do like a Harry Potter, let's face it, if it was any more HP it would start to feel like a haunted house, less is more. The 4 is for the lack of a greet when we walked in, I think that it is very important to greet customers with a quick hello, it makes the wait painless! Overall, bravo Bad Owl!",

The nitrogen cold brew coffee, however, was truly special. It tasted like coffee, but smoother. No bite. And with the creamy, no fizz, satisfying taste of a nitrogen beer. A True experience. Worth $4. Ps if you're gonna wait in the looooong line you might as well get more than one coffee drink!",

She came out with a free float for me, in addition to my drink and apologizing profusely. She even gave me a coupon for next time!

Not over the top, but enough to grow a fan base. Coffee program was nice, nothing too complicated.   The Bad - the pastries I felt were only okay. Croissants are my favorite, but these could have used warming up as an extra service as they were a bit dried. This is a popular spot, so expect a wait to get your caffeine fix.   The Verdict - definitely a fun stop if you are looking for something to do for a pick me up. Take photos, hang out with friends and support a nerd community.",

I don't like bacon so they switched it out for yogurt free of charge. The signature drink, butterbeer coffee was lovely. You can get it hot or iced. The atmosphere was warm, friendly, and relaxed. I highly recommend this place to every Harry Potter fan !",

I had really high expectations for a HP-themed coffee shop but this place didn't live up to the hype for me.   The most disappointing thing for me was that I thought the place was going to have more of a HP atmosphere. I wanted to feel like I was in Hogwarts! Perhaps they could incorporate the different house colors into the store, or have the house flags on the wall or something. I was also expecting the drink names to have more HP references too - so far there's just the butterbeer latte. As much as I love HP, I probably won't be making the drive out there for another visit.",

I've been told I make the best & this one could pass a blindfold taste test!  Have one, you'll understand.  Then today a friend of mine came into work with a 12 oz Kyoto cold brew & let me try it.   He poured about an ounce into a cup for me.  The first sip was brutal and caught me off guard.   I have never had anything like this.  It had an edge to it, almost like a sip of alcohol but once you get past that there's a potency & depth there that makes you want more.   I went back for another sip & it had the same kick.  I think rather than say I like it I can honestly say I respect it. This is a coffee to sip not a latte to chug.  After just that little bit I was wide awake & clear headed.  An acquired taste perhaps?  Medicinal coffee?  I'm not sure but dear Owl could you consider selling this in a 4 oz. size?  I could never finish a 12 oz and would be wracked with guilt if I ever threw any of it away!",

It's best to try it black to fully taste the coffee; it's easier to taste the quality that way. My best friend is a Harry Potter fan so of course this was a must go for our Friday Night Adventures. We waited about 45 minutes in line and about an hour total by the time our drinks were ready...we totally 100% expected a wait because of how much coverage and buzz this place was getting all over Facebook, IG, Twitter, etc.   My BFF got an iced vanilla latte, my other BFF got a jade mint tea, and I was going for an iced coffee. Get up to the register, and come to find out they they're not serving anything that's made via drip. I was a little disappointed at that so I went ahead and settled for a black Americano. I was VERY empresses by the quality of the espresso. Very strong! I love authentic, manual espresso.  The lighting fixtures were a super nice touch to the look of the place, baristas were very friendly, and the music was different, not exactly what you'd expect in a coffee shop. Taylor Swift?? Really?? Ugh, annoyinggggg!   I definitely would like to go back again and try a few different things. The lavender latte, butter beer latte, and the one I'm dying to try, the cookie butter latte. I really hope they extend their hours soon. It would be cool to go back for an evening of Friday Night Adventures with the BFF.",

They need to hire more people, this place is obviously super popular, and there was constantly a long line the whole time I was there, and all the employees looked like they wanted to have a hysterical cry (and I don't blame them).  Everyone was really super nice and friendly though, despite the obviously high stress environment.  Lattes were delicious.  I was worried they were going to be way too sweet, and mine was maybe about 20% too sweet for my taste, but they definitely weren't syrupy or badly made.  They did get mine wrong, but it was another flavor I wanted to try sometime anyway, so I just let it go, and it was tasty.  Lots of interesting flavors on the menu.  The menu isn't quite as awesome as Grouchy John's, but this is still one of the better coffee shops in town.  Their nutella latte is better than Sambalatte's, IMO.  And I'm definitely swayed by the awesome theme.",

    "text": "Do you like Harry Potter? Do you like coffee too? Great! This place has both and has good customer service. I was greeted right away and immediately I knew I wanted to try the butter brew latte, but I wanted it with coffee. In this case, the gentleman explained to me it will be 3 shots of espresso in the medium size I was getting. Works for me. Also, there were some chocolate croissant samples out to try, but I passed for now. It did look good though. They also have some macarons and other baked goods in a case. I'll give that a try next time, but I'm here for the homage to Harry Potter. Cute, fun, a little Halloween like, but not too cheesy. It's actually well themed- decorated. The tables with some catchy Potter references are clever. My drink came up pretty fast and was tasty. It's different for sure, but in a good way. I would describe it like a smooth butter vanilla coffee. The place is also very clean and there is plenty of parking. Definitely would recommend checking out.",

The first time we went there it was 25% off all pastries. Well today that only applied for breaded pastries. It doesn't make sense does it? $12 for a cup of tea and a little piece of cake sounds a bit much.",

With that said, I'm still not 100% sure how big of a fan I am of the shop. I still think they are over priced ~ $1 more than what other coffee shops would charge. And I'm not impressed with how crowded and cramped the space is and how slow the line moves. After being open for several months you'd think they'd have gotten a grasp of quick and speedy service. While I liked the latte I think if I had to pick between this and another local coffee shop I'd prob go elsewhere so I could have a comfy place to sit and sip my coffee and because I typically don't have an hr to wait to order and receive my drink.",

I was pretty excited to come check this little coffee shop out with my husband since I am a huge Harry Potter lover but the customer service and the food was beyond subpar. I start by asking questions about the menu and the coffee because my husband, who I dragged all the way across town for this place doesn't really drink coffee but will drink the sweet coffees. You know they type of coffee that's like liquid sugar with a small splash of coffee so I'm asking what they recommend and they were annoyed and impatient with me even tho there was no one behind me, I even waited to order so I could ask questions with out holding the line up. So with little to no help I order us both some coffees and waffles. Not only did they take forever because they had one waffle maker going, on a Sunday, at brunch time they were flavorless and soggy. The waffles were just flat out bad. The only reason Bad Owl Coffee gets two stars is because the coffee was actually pretty good. But it definitely was not worth 55 dollars. It's over priced and honestly just disrespectful to Harry Potter.",

    "text": "Bad Owl Coffee is always a spot I bring my visitors to, just because it's Harry Potter themed and does justice for an Instagram op.  \\_()_/    The espresso drink selection is excellent. I love their Lavender Latte, but the MUST TRY item is the Butter Beer Latte (hello, Harry Potter, you just have to!) Their food is also really good, it's just too pricey for me. The sandwiches are served with a salad and a handful of kettle chips.   There is a lot of tables and chairs for you to hang out or do some work, but most of the times I've been there, it was too crowded and freakin busy (good for them though.) The ambiance of the place is really nice as well; not only are you surrounded with everything Harry Potter, but they use natural light during the day.   Two thing I wasn't too happy with is the volume of the music they play in the coffee shop and parking is a pain. Each time I've visited, the music was so loud I was practically yelling just to talk to the person next to me. The lot maybe big, but since every time I pay a visit it's busy, the lot designated for Bad Owl is always full.  Bad Owl is worth it though. If you're visiting Vegas and you're a Harry Potter fan, drive over to the coffee shop and enjoy a cup of Butterbeer. :D",

Everyone is so nice and genuinely just seems to want you to get the best cup of coffee. Me and my boyfriend went and got cold brew, Spanish latte, croissant and sandwhich and it came to about $35..

I'm guessing a lot of people there didn't either and that's probably why it took a while in line because people were asking questions.

The coffee was lukewarm, the decorations was a pile of Harry potter books in a corner table, and they were violating quite a bit of Las Vegas health code violations, and it was a very small area of space tbh..",

I ordered the iced white chocolate latte, my friends ordered Nutella blended, mocha, and hot green tea. Everything was underwhelming. Prices were a little high for the sizes of the cups. I would rather spend my money at grouchies or Starbucks. The service was fine and the wait was average, but my drink was sloppy with coffee running down the sides. No one in the party will be returning to this place. I do commend their efforts in decorating with random Harry Potter related items to lure customers in.",

[Environment] This coffee shop is COOL! The decor, feel and setup really reminds me of Harry Potter. It makes me feel like this is a spot where all the student wizards gather to do homework, chat, meet and enjoy some delicious coffee! Well done with the decoration! Love it!  [Service] The staff are friendly, kind and knowledgable. They have great recommendations and suggestions. Very patient with you looking through their big menu of selections and prompt with making which ever drink you desire. I was very pleased with the service.  [Drinks] The coffee here are very True, they just aren't loaded with milk and sugar to hide the amazing taste of coffee but I could really taste the what their coffee has to offer. Good bodied flavor and nicely roasted. Note: They also serve alcoholic beverages! So if you are needing something to \"wine\" down you day...they have it! Sadly I haven't tried the alcoholic beverages but maybe my next visit I will.  Overall, this a really neat place and I really recommend. If you're looking for something different and a cool spot. Check this place out! \"I'm a wizard Harry!\"  [ See it, Taste it, Yelp it! ]",

My friend and I stopped by in the evening to get a drink and had a great time at this establishment. When you walk in, everything is Harry Potter-themed... from the signs to the artwork to the quotes painted on the tables, the beauty of this place is in the details. The barista was very friendly and helped me order the best drink for my tastes. I ordered a butterbeer latte, which I was told is their most popular drink, and I totally see why. It was sweet, but not too sweet, and had just the right amount of butterscotch. It also had a beautiful floral design on top and somehow they incorporated pink dye? I'm not even sure how this happened, but I was very impressed. The only thing I didn't love about this place (and I'm nit picking here) was the music, but it was not enough to deter me at all. I will certainly come back here next time I'm in Vegas!",

The cafe made me feel as if I was in a backlot at Universal Studios! The decorations are awesome and the place looks just like a movie scene! But with delicious coffee and pastries. The cafe is adorned in shiplap and includes memorable moments from the Harry Potter series like the Hogwarts acceptance letters, Platform 934, Hedwig perched in his cage atop Harry's luggae, and the hidden Dementor in the back corner. I love the theme!  I love Nutella (you're crazy if you don't), so it was only right that I order the Nutella latte and I'm glad I did. What genius thought of this? It was the perfect amount of sweetness! Also, I love the fact that Bad Owl offers more than just coffee. They also offer tea and if I'm not mistaken, I believe I saw a few craft beers and different wines. As far as eats goes, they have sandwiches, waffles, and a variety of desserts. Yum!  Can't wait to come back and try the Butter Brew Latte!",

    "text": "You know those Werther's Original hard candies that your grandpa keeps in his pocket? Okay...that's exactly what the butter beer latte tastes like. No joke, for realsies. This is the drink that evidently led flocks of people to converge and apparently was also sold out for days at a time. Maybe a brilliant marketing ploy? Law of supply and demand? Or perhaps just the latest viral like white vans and whoever Daniel is. This too, shall pass -- The lines seemed to calm down anyway, or at least in the latter part of the day when we went.  Disclosure: I've never been into Harry Potter, nor tried to be. For those that are, Bad Owl's howling your name. From an outsider's perspective who knows nothing about the wizardry, I did like the dark brick affectation and the follow-through of its motif. Refreshing to see something OTHER than the minimalist hipster, too-cool-for-school vibrations that some of these newer coffee shops tend to exude. Yay on being different.  **The gear-grinding (no pun intended): Lattes = expresso + milk. Why oh why would you name an item on your menu a \"latte\" if there's no expresso in it? You're telling me I'm paying almost $5 for a 12 oz. glorified milk and an extra dollar if I want the expresso part? Don't fool me with your wording and ask me if I want an \"extra\" shot either if there's not even a single one in the first place. Truth be told, I couldn't even taste the expresso even though I did opt for the \"extra\" shot, and I'm caffeine-sensitive, too. Boo on extortionate pricing.   I'm not sure if this is the case for all their lattes. If so, coffee's way overpriced along with their bakery goods. You're paying for the ambiance and novelty.",

Lavender latte, at first was waay too milky tasting. As with the other drinks I tried. Almost gave up, till  barista fam from another coffee shop suggested I try an add shot and change the milk choice.  Well that worked!  Tastes better with soy.. my issue is paying 6.98 for the smallest size cup.  Granted it's a specialty drink, but I pay that much for my healthy smoothie!   Service is friendly, the staff works as a quick as they can. But as far as making drinks right, it's still inconsistent.  Tonight they forgot to put  the shot of lavender in my lavender latte! The owner is gracious enough to have drinks remade, but this time I didn't realize til we drove off.. sigh.   Harry Potter inspired is the attraction here. My kids were big HP fans.  Me not so much..I'm just an old lady.  I just don't have a clue what smuggles are, and have no clue why almost every other customer takes a pic with the owl, but it's so cute to see all the excitement over this shop. Will it be enough in the long run? I hope so, cause right now the coffee ain't cutting it for me.",

    "text": "A Harry Potter coffee shop. It's wanderful! I love everything about this place, except the drinks. Hence, the not so perfect rating.  After visiting the Harry Potter theme park in Orlando last year, I was going through butter beer withdrawals.  To be honest, the butter beer here hot/cold/blended is not the same. It's made inconsistently and they need to work on this. It's either too milky, shy on butterscotch, or sickly sweet (could not finish and tossed it!).    I love lavender drinks and I can't say I'm a fan either. My drink was so distracting with the amount of lavender tea leaves present with every other sip. I had to spit it out every time I came across one. Please strain your tea better.   The Black Forest latte had an overall good taste, but was heavy on the milk and diluted the cherry flavor.   The almond latte just was boring and I wouldn't order it again. I did not like that at the end there was a glob of almonds at the bottom.   Have you tried their baked goods here? Amazing! I absolutely love the coconut muffin. I must find out who bakes these.   The staff is nice and I understand they are still working out the kinks. I had several drinks re-made due to lack of communication from cashier to barista. For example: I asked for blended and got iced. I ordered Black Forest latte and received Black iced tea.   With mediocre drinks and long lines, I think it's best to come back when they are more experienced.  *****Yelp 100 Challenge 2016***** 19/100",

The line has significantly gone down a lot. No longer is the line going out the door. We still waited in line for about 15 minutes  but the wait was all inside the building.   First off....they were out of the pistachio latte. It's been \"out\" for a good month now. It's not even on the menu anymore but the barista says they're out right now. I asked her is this drink permanently gone or you're just out? She said they're out. (But it's not even on the menu though.....okay......if you say so) So I ordered a small iced coconut latte and my boyfriend ordered a Spanish latte. What kind of coffee/caffeine do they use? There was absolutely no caffeine taste plus I didn't \"feel any caffeine\" in my body. Shit....even Jack in the Box coffee have more caffeine than this! Very disappointed. And I'm pretty caffeine-sensitive so it should hit my body but it never did. At almost $10 for two small sized drinks, I would expect it to be worth it. Nope, it's not. And even though it's listed as 12 oz...it's not. This cup was smaller than a Starbucks tall sized.   They had a good thing going....key word: HAD. The drinks are disappointing now. If it wasn't a HP themed coffee shop, this update would have been a 1 star. There are plenty of other local coffee shops that makes way better drinks. (Sunrise Coffee, Madhouse Coffee and Holley's Cuppa are always my go-to local coffee shops.)",

First time I attempted to come here the line wrapped around and I ditched the place no way I was waiting an hour for some coffee.  Than me and friends tried again on a Tuesday afternoon and it was a lot better, not as busy but once we got our order the line did start to form outside so we came in just in time.   It's a very small coffee shop. Not many seats available but that's normal. We just took our order to go. Although I did order a Affogato and I wasn't able to get it to go so I had to hurry up and drink/eat it before we could head out. It was pretty good. The ice cream was creamy and with the espresso shot it went very well.   My friend got the Biscoff latte iced which is basically Cookie Butter latte. That was soooooooooo damn delicious. It is on the sweeter side so getting the smaller size would probably be best. My other friend got the Butter beer latte iced which seemed appropriate considering where we were! That was pretty delicious also but sweet as well.   I got a spinach quiche to go and I didn't really like it. My friend got a almond croissant which was uhhhmayzingg. Bomb!    The staff were very nice. If I was in the area again I'd come back!",

If your motto is: more cream and more sugar to drown out that coffee flavor; then you will appreciate the coffee here. Whether your a coffee enthusiast or just a novice with this delectable beverage; Bad Owl has you covered.   As you pass through the gates to this wonderful place your journey begins. The positive vibes start even in the parking lot! The decor always grabs my attention when I come in. This feels recently like my second home, due to the fact that physical therapy is across the street! I could not of planned that better. After they stretch and strengthen me this is my reward. It is my treat that I envision during these miserable sets at the weight machine. Bad Owl is my healing place and does not ever disappoint!   A wise someone once said that wood holds onto energy. Maybe it was an owl that had this sacred knowledge, but the inner energy that is preserved in their wood walls either from customers or  staff inside the store is calming. Now let me explain why I keep making the wood references. The store is lined with dark mahogany wood. The beauty of from lining the store with this type of adornment just enhances the atmosphere of the store. The realm of nature encircles the patrons and staff with natural vibes from the outdoors.   The menu of Bad Owl is a fantastic tome that offers so many delicious choices for coffee or espresso. They make some of their own creations too that cannot be found anywhere else but here! A fantastic example of this is the Second Breakfast Latte. It tastes like sweet breakfast cereal that has cinnamon and nutmeg dusted around the rim of the cup. This is one of those coffee houses where enjoying it here is best. Plus great coffee tastes best out of a glass cup or mug! When enjoying your coffee, if you can find the time ask for the glass mug it takes the espresso to the next level!   Bad Owl is known for its coffee and espresso, but what many are not familiar with is the other delicious options that are available. They serve sandwiches, waffles, and other excellent pairings that are amazing with coffee; but wine or beer would be just as good. Yes, your new favorite coffee establishment sells alcohol! Wine is a particular favorite of mine so the selection of delicious choices is outstanding. I recommend any kind or red wine! Great pairing with almost anything.   The staff of Bad Owl are rocking stars that ensures the coffee is strong and fresh while delivering a wicked image in every ordered cup. I still woe and coo over the images that they draw in my espresso drinks, but I am not sure how they make those images last to the last drop. The most consist image that they use is a feather. With the weather here in the desert changing the holidays are coming. During special times of the year the staff will use glitter and other representations of these holidays to make your coffee a little more cheerful!   On my visit today I was able to sip my latte next to their Christmas tree that they already have put up. It felt very comforting to know that I can come and experience the holidays right here with my favorite coffee in a setting that \"feels\" warm and special. Come and enjoy some coffee and a waffle which is delicious with their syrup and cut up bananas. An option for lunch is either their avocado toast or BLT. The avocado is fresh and made daily, I asked before trying! The BLT with Japanese mayo is so fantastic; it's the massive flavor filled bacon that makes the sandwich! If you can stay and enjoy a moment to yourself. Steal a moment if need be then come and explore life with your favorite coffee or tea beverage all to yourself!!",

Well...I thought it would be a nice way to start our weekend and dull the sting of sitting through Saturday schoo. Plus, I was feeling groggy and needed a pick me up!  I had the Nitrogen coffee with sea salt, make sure you stir it a little before drinking it. The first time I thought it so bitter tasting and awkward with a creamy mustache on my lip!  My daughter ordered the Lemon Chiffon Latte and enjoyed it, not amazing but good. My son ordered the Nitrogen and only drank half, he said it was really intense,  he saved it for the next day! We all had the Nutella beignets $1.10 for a tasty donut hole. All in all it's casual, friendly,  comfortable and tastefully decorated with Harry Potter in mind.  My daughter said it's a great place for hanging with friends and she could see herself studying for school on the regular. Now that would be great...no more Saturday school!",

The concept of four separate shooters is cool, and the flavors are really unique (or at least a couple of them are). But the execution just fell flat: the temperature of the drinks was inconsistent, even within each drink. Maybe it was supposed to be a layered temperature experience, but the menu doesn't so indicate. The only one I affirmatively enjoyed was the blue rose. Even so, it was hard to tell how good the coffee itself was through the various additions.  It is somewhat dark inside, although I got used to that quickly.",

    "text": "Oh phooey, lost my draft. Oh well.  Bad Owl Coffee is a coffee place that has been so successful that they've expanded to the Southwest. However, I've only been to their original location on Eastern Ave in Henderson near the corner of Horizon Ridge Pkwy, and it took me two visits before deciding to review it.  Originally, they were known as the place that paid homage to Harry Potter. They still have some vague references including \"Platform 9 6/8\" and the \"Avado Ricotta\" on their new avocado toast menu, but I'm sure they probably got a cease-and-desist letter at some point. That said, they're still a good place to visit for coffee and offer several different preparations.  I first experienced Bad Owl last year when I tried their cookie butter latte ($4.90 small / $5.40 large). I still remember that the latte came out hot and that there was cookie butter flavor and sweetness. It was delicious. However, I wouldn't order it again simply because the cookie butter pooled at the bottom of the cup, making it difficult to enjoy the flavor evenly. I suppose if you enjoy dilute cookie butter to start, ramping up to intense cookie butter and finally ending up as clumped cookie butter, then you won't mind it.  Today, I came back to meet up with a friend. She recommended that I try the Kyoto cold brew coffee ($5.30 small, $5.90 large). If you look to the right of the register, you'll see a towering apparatus with ice-cold water at the top and coffee at the bottom. This is what they use to make this style of cold brew, and the result is fabulous.  There isn't any acidity in the Kyoto cold brew. It starts off with the typical somewhat grassy/pungent coffee flavor that turns me off from enjoying anything from Stumptown, but it gives way to a complex, roasted, low-if-any bitterness drink that even has tea-like notes toward the end. I loved every sip of it, and I also got pretty wired from the caffeine. This is the best cold brew coffee which I've tasted yet.  I'll definitely have to stop by Bad Owl if I want a delicious cold brew coffee, and perhaps I'll eventually look into their other lattes, food menu, or $2 off beer (bottled, not on draft) and wine daily from 4-7pm.",

This time my sis and I got the Mint Mojito and the Nitrogen Brew. The Mint Mojito is an attempt to make something similar to Philz Mint Mojito that I am accustomed to. It didn't really hit the mark because it was not cold enough, not minty enough, and not coffee-y enough. It was decent but probably not something I'd order again. The Nitrogen Brew is a cold brew that is supposed to have a smoother taste but to me, it had a harsher taste that I have had with other cold brews. It doesn't come with ice but it was cool when I received it. I'd suggest adding in a couple of ice cubes.  So the drinks this time weren't great but the theme makes up for it. The decor is super cool with brooms and other HP-themed memorabilia. There are several small tables and a larger bar table so definitely a good place to get work done if you don't mind the somewhat dark mood lighting.  Overall, I'd still recommend it but ask them to make what they are known for.  BTW, they also have craft beers available.",

We ordered and paid and when the food came we were missing a sandwich. When I went and asked about it the guy said he would check on it. Well, apparently it wasn't rung in . Instead of them telling me it wasn't ordered, they just ignored us. When I went back up she told me with a sneer and a loud voice \"I checked the tape and it wasn't ordered OR paid for. Besides, I read your order back to you!\". I told her that letting me know when I asked in the first place would have been nice because I was perfectly okay with paying for it, but we would like our third sandwich. I paid and she glared at me the entire time. It wasn't like I wanted a sandwich for free or I wouldn't have come here because it's overpriced anyway! I won't be back.",

They don't serve brewed coffee, so the barista/cashier :) offered to make me an Americano.  I ordered an Americano & 1-Salted Caramel Macron & 1-Lemon Macron.

We ordered a sandwich each, and while \"home made\" is nice, this is a little too far. You remember when you were broke at home and hungry and decided to throw together whatever you had in the fridge and make a sandwich? And maybe some of those ingredients weren't in the prime anymore? Bingo. My sandwich had straight lunch meat on it, clearly of the low quality found in a plastic bag style, wilted lettuce, greasy toast, and a decent aioli. Do not recommend there food.  Their coffee, however, is pretty good. I can speak to their Kyoto Coffee. More expensive and smaller than you'd expect, just add a little cream to stave off some of the (very light!) acidity and you've got a cold brew that won't just give you a huge boost of energy, but a refreshing \"Ahhhh\" as you drink it down.  Three stars due to high price of low-quality food.",

The problem I have is with the beer selection.   Yes, Bad Owl Coffee has a beer list too! BUT they don't seem to be doing a good job of keeping up with it. The last two times I've been there they have been out of or stopped offering multiple beers on the menu. Even the bottled brews on display at the counter don't accurately reflect what is available at that moment. Its frustrating when the thing you want is not available that day...its worse when your second or third choices are not available either, and its downright annoying when you go back the following week to find that nobody fixed the problem.  I know that there aren't many coffee shops that also have a beer list, and the beers they do have available are pretty good. But if you're going to be a coffee shop that also offers beer, don't half-ass it. Either maintain your inventory and update your menus, or just don't offer beer at all and stick to the coffee. I'd give this place 5 stars otherwise.",

It's what to be expected on opening week and definitely being Harry Potter themed. So after about a 30 minute wait I get to the counter. The lady there was very helpful and friendly. She recommended a couple drinks which I bought both for myself. They were very efficient and got the drinks out really fast.       The only reason why I have this place 4 stars was because of the amazing service and decor. I would have liked for the coffee names and pastries to have a more creative Harry Potter is name to them. Overall though with the actual coffee beverages, I'm not impressed at all. I ordered the iced butter beer latte which just tasted like a caramel frap with maybe a hint of butterscotch. I've had butter beer from the wizarding world of harry potter and I was expecting this latte to bring me back memories of that magical moment, but it didn't. The biscoff was pretty good, but nothing extravagant. I feel anyone can get this flavor and kind of coffee anywhere else rather than driving across town for it. It reminded me too much of Starbucks. I for sure would rather drive out of my way for dutch brothers. Sorry bad owl. I probably won't be returning.",

However, other than that there was no real magic about it. Everything was quite more expensive than I expected....even more expensive than most specialty coffee places in California! (I'm from California).  I would suggest, only go for the coffee.. I bought some pastries, but they warm it up by microwave. I got the nitro cold coffee, which was extremely smooth and dark and rich. It was like a good stout without the alcohol. My boyfriend got the butter brew latte. Okay, BOC, just call it butterscotch milk! The latte didn't even have any coffee element. With already being just milk and paying 4-6 bucks for just milk, you don't have espresso?? You have to ask for a shot espresso, which obviously they would charge. I wondered why they asked do you want a shot of espresso. When he got it, he was disappointed that it was called a latte when in fact it was just a cup of milk. So I had to ask the barista why they called it a latte, etc, and got a free shot of espresso.",

    "text": "This was my first experience at Bad Owl. I was not aware it was a Harry Potter themed coffee shop. I'm not an HP fan so the \"theme\" of the shop mattered very little to me. I was really looking for a new coffee place that wasn't Starbucks.   I drove up to the shop a little after 7 am. It was hard to tell if the place was opened as there was no \"Open\" sign nor was there any times for the shop posted anywhere on the doors. There was 1 other car in the lot so I decided to get out of my car and go inside.   They were, in fact, open. The guys behind the bar were very friendly and greeted me warmly. The menu was a little confusing and I was somewhat pressed for time so I didn't have a lot of time to stare at their big menu. I asked for just a drip coffee and was informed that their coffee maker was under repair.   I was seriously going to walk out. WTF do you mean your coffee maker is broken? You are a coffee shop. I think the guys could tell I was going to walk and they offered to make me anything. One suggested an Americano. I've never been a huge fan a espresso without milk but figured since I was there, why not. I agreed to the Americano.   They made the drink relatively quickly and it was inexpensive (a whopping $2). The guys seemed really concerned about whether I liked the drink, which I did.   I would definitely come back to Bad Owl. Service and quality of the product were above and beyond. As for the decor, this was not my reason for visiting so the other posts that it was not HP enough mattered little to me. The price point was a super nice bonus as well.",

Good atmosphere, not over done on the HP theme (bad for me but good for the muffles I guess) loved the tables as you can see from my pics. I ordered the lavender latte. The fact that there is no actual coffee in the drinks is perfect for me because I don't need any additional caffeine in my life. Siriusly. It was herbal. As others stated, herbal NOT floral. Eh. I should've ordered the butterbeer latte I guess but I don't think I'd drive all the way back over here for a second visit.",

Beyond substandard; it was \"awful in a cup,\" at $10, for both.  For all the HYPE this place generated, the atmosphere was also disappointing. No mood, no detail and a dirty environment. It was a boring, basic cafe with random Harry Potter decorations slapped here and there. No menu detailing! Don't just print out a basic piece of paper and slap in on a clipboard. Create a menu that's exciting to your guests and fun to read. They didn't even decorate their bathroom and worse still it was messy and smelled.  To top it all off, they were out of their Butterbeer Lattes, (the only remotely Harry Potter themed item on their menu,) AND as of 2/17/15 they ran out of coffee beans... No coffee shop runs out of the main product that keeps their business running...  Bad product, bad ambiance, bad planning... At least it's appropriately named: BAD.",

All good, the butter brew gave me a tummy ache but is my sisters go to.  I want to try the lavender latte, but am too anxious to try it since it's a weird concept. Oh and the teas here fantastic, pretty good variety of old classics and exotic ones you didn't know existed! The only downside is they quite often have a line out the door, bit they are pretty quick. Most I have ever waited to order was 10 min.  Definately a place to try!",

First off the menu, as others have said, is confusing.  If it's a latte, it should have coffee, if it's a steamer, call it a steamer.  Kind of annoying to pay full price for a latte then to be asked, do you want a shot of espresso in that? Well, duh....then you paying way more  for a latte then you should.  I've tried several coffee drinks, most are fine.  My favorite drink, an iced coffee, I guess I don't enjoy all the gimmicky drinks.  I didn't like the pistachio because of the powdery stuff they put on top, it became globs of powder in my coffee, ewe.  But the flavor was great so I'll ask for it without the topping. The food, is pretty spectacular.  That said, is it the right place for $30 lunch? No. Not in my opinion. Overall I like it here, I just have a few personal issues with the menu/cost.  We will be back.",

But a coworker of mine asked me if I had been there yet. A themed coffee shop sounded fun and I had the extra time in my day to drive over to check it out so off we went (I dragged my boyfriend along). The shop is clean, and cute and has themed tables, some HP references on the walls, and the books stacked in the back corner. Its cute. The staff and owners were friendly and helpful with questions. We first ordered hot coffees and they were average. Don't get me wrong.. they were good, but I personally didn't need to drive across town to get them. The pastries were very good though. We got a coconut muffin and a chocolate twist (the chocolate twist is my recommendation if you don't know what to choose). Before leaving, we wanted a clod drink to go. I was told they couldn't make their teas cold (other than the house iced tea) because they use loose leaf. I have had loose leaf cold before many many many times so I am unsure if it's just their brewing equipment but I didn't argue. I then decided I would take the Apple tea hot BUT they were out. Sadness. We settled on their cold house brew iced tea. I personally need a sweeter tea and they added some syrup to help and it did. The iced tea was very good. We took those to go. I'll be back, but being across town for me, I wouldn't say this is my go to.. but if I am in the area then why not?",

I live in the south side in Spring Valley and it still took me 20min to get there. Its DEEEP in Henderson  The decor is super cute and I can only imagine how it looks when it is Halloween.  When you walk in, there is about 20-30 seats starting from group tables, to individual tables that seat 2 people. Decor is cute and not as Harry Potter themed as I would like but Im guessing due to copyright infringement.  There is the sign from the Plaform 9 5/8 ( 9 and 3/4 from the movie), a white owl (Hedwig), dementor hanging from the ceiling, and cute little writings on the table like \"everyday im muggling\" and \"Keep calm and use black magic\"- see pics We had ordered 2 drinks 1) Sea Salt caramel Nitro Cold: Almost like Nitro Stout- Super chocolately and def wanna get the sea salt caramel (because Chocolate and sea salt combo is a def must do) -Coffee infused with nitrogen, giving the coffee a sweet malty taste without any added sugar and served from the tap 2)Spanish Latte- Sweet cream and expresso- not super sweet- if you like super sweet drinks, this is not the drink for you. Doesn't come with ICE. Very creamy and again not super sweet cause I don't like sweet drinks.   NEED TO COME HERE FOR HALOWEEN for the Haloween-esque and Harry potter-ish theme. Also the alchemy inspire coffee contraptions are my favorite!!",

Well, after spending about 90.00 over the past three visits, i can tell you, Bad Owl is a bad ouch on my wallet.  1.  Harry Potter - OK, so you know I have read the books many times and have seen Sorcerer's Stone about 12 times.  The Harry Potter theme at this place was a bit, well underwhelming. It is a bit of a gimmick.  2.  The Menu - Wow, what a choice and what a confusing choice as well. OK, I admit I am an analytical person and like a nice organized list.  Having the menu on clip boards with paper that is rolled up, or on the wall in handwriting and artsy and fartsy, actually made it difficult for me to read.  3. The coffee - Ummm, where are the large cups?  a. Hot Mocha Coffee - not bad b. Nitrogen Cold Brewed Coffee - From the tap, kind of like Guiness.I found it to be okay. c. Kyoto Brewed Ice Coffee- Okay, if you put a fine wine and a drinkable wine in front of me, I would not know the difference.  This brew was something I failed to admire. d. Lavender Latte - Really? I think not. e.  Butter Brew Latte - A bit much. f.  Chocolate Croissant and Macarons - We wolfed these all down.  Overall, the coffee was very creative, just not coffee. These are interesting flavors, however, challenging to create a strong following.    GK Says, a unique experience with good coffee.  If you want great coffee, Grouchy Johns has something special!",

    "text": "One of the things this city is lacking is themed cafes. It's quite nice to be able to relax, enjoy a hot or cold drink and not be in a rush by choice while being in a different world - Hogwarts. Owl in a cage, Platform 9 3/4, Quidditch, lightning bolt scar...espresso patronum!  There's a few reasons why I stopped going to chain coffee shops: they butcher my name (I mean it's not unique like LaQueefa), DBs in line who think they have more important things to do than you do, and the drinks are boring and there's not enough caffeine to wake up from the snooze fest.  I prefer going here in the morning. There's always an empty table so, you can eat a quiche/ cake/ macaron/ pastry/ cookie/ tart and drink your beverage. The morning crew are friendlier and they take the time to make sure they don't put stuff you are sensitive/ allergic to in your drink. It's the little things like that that means a lot. Definitely great service! I've tried their quiche, strawberry tart, chocolate hazelnut cake, passion fruit jasmine tea, Nutella latte, and Nutella blended.  They also have butter beer latte, lavender, pistachio, Biscoff, matcha, etc. They sell shirts and tanks too. You pay for novelty...and for the afternoon crew to butcher your name in case you get a kick out of that.",

    "text": "Coolest coffee shop everrrrrrrr!!!!!   My husband thought the names of the coffees weren't \"Harry potter\" enough so he suggested a few to our barista on our 2nd visit here. Very embarrassing lol. Voldermocha was probably his best one. He also thought it would be funny to put our coffee/waffle under the names Harry, Potter, and Hermione.   On our first visit, I got the Kyoto cold brew coffee and my husband got the nitrogen iced coffee. As we sat in this cool place drinking our coffee, we decided to also get the matcha waffle to go.   I enjoyed my husband nitrogen iced coffee more than the Kyoto cold brew I had ordered on our first visit so when we went back a 2nd time (in like 3 days), i ordered the nitrogen coffee which even LOOKS cool, almost looks like a Guinness!   My husband had a mocha this time (hence why he asked for a \"Voldermocha\") and we also ordered the red velvet waffle to share. Our son ate all the ice  cream pretty quickly before he got started on the waffles, which were delicious! I think I preferred the matcha one, only because it was a little different than your normal waffle. Both were def good tho, nothing disappointed us here.   Service was great, ambiance of this shop was awesome, and the food and coffee were delicious. Can't wait to come back!",

Theme restaurants normally leave much to be desired however the designers of this coffee shop for us Muggles nailed it!  From the bookshelves to the floor to the walls to their menu I could see (HP fans or) customers hanging out until they close each night as the minute you walk through the doors you feel like you are on your way to Diagon Alley. Regarding their coffee beverages, you can't go wrong with the Butter Brew Latte (add a shot of espresso) or the Matcha Green tea latte and you must pair those with their hazelnut beignets. I wish they opened one of these in Summerlin....or had a portal like the one on Platform 9 3/4....just saying....",

    "text": "As much as I use YELP  for advice on great places to eat or have a wonderful cup of coffee I'm really bad about taking the time to write a review but that changes today as I hope to share with others my wonderful experience at Bad Owl Coffee. As a Las Vegas native I'm always looking for locally owned and operated small businesses to support. Upon entering the door I was immediately transported to the wizardly world of Harry Potter  so without ordering anything that was an automatic plus. I began taking pictures to show to my adult daughters who really LOVE anything Harry Potter. The very sweet young lady that helped me I must give 5 stars to her alone!! I explained to her it was my first time there she was patient, professionally and friendly. I ordered a Biscoff Latte which was  D-LIGHTFUL!!!! I asked for my coffee in a mug because I love to see the artwork and my taste buds were so very happy the 1st cup was gone in minutes. I opted to order a second cup and a grilled cheese sandwich that I added prosciutto to and let me tell you the second cup was super cute and ever so yummy but the sandwich was pretty Amazing!!  I will be back and I hope this review will encourage those of you who are reading it to do the same!! #Blessings Bad Owl  Coffee",

Went in there with a new friend I had met here in town, she wanted the pistacio Latte and told me I can get most drinks Veganized since I am transitioning (again) to Veganism.      I ordered a Vegan version of butterbrew I believe it was called but told the girl I had never been there and she said, great, welcome, so far a good start...she asked what size I wanted and I said large and she said, this cup?   or this one?   I said, that one-The larger one...ok so then she asked if I wanted espresso?   I said, sure...?     Im new, I dont know...she nodded..  So...It was $14 for 2 drinks, I looked at the reciept after I left, I was charged $1 extra for the espresso...another $1 extra for the larger cup...Its fine but could she have told me this?    The drink is $4.90 but there is an extra charge for this cup and an extra charge for this espresso?      I feel taken advantage of a bit since she knew I was new and didnt know how it all worked.   The coffee was OK--Nothing special and my friend Susan did not like her drink either which was made with milk so it wasn't because they were Vegan drinks, only mine was...she said it had no real strong flavor, I am sure that would have been another $1 charge to get some real flavor in there.  So...thats crossed off the list.",

It's dimly lit in here with dark furniture and the sun providing some natural light in from the windows and door. Honestly, just the way I like it. Love waking up slowly in a darker setting with a warm cup of coffee. Fall, is that you?  When I arrived this morning, it was quiet. It's definitely clear that the party picks up here after 9 a.m. The line is currently extended to the door. And for good reason. The coffee here is incredible, it's decked out like a Harry Potter movie and the staff is super kind. My only regret is that I'm in shorts and it's a little chilly in here, but I got my coffee warm this morning so I'm good to go! But I'm liking the vibe. Usually I come here on a weekend and it's packed with absolutely no where to sit. Not ideal for a working situation, but the busy buzz going on around me in the weirdest way is the best thing I need in order to focus? Officially the weirdest sentence ever, but again, really loving this place for a work atmosphere.  On to the coffee. Do yourself a favor and grab one of their signature drinks. Every time I come in, I try to explore something new. I haven't had a single cup of coffee here I haven't liked. The recipes are incredible. And again, you really can't beat the awesome Harry Potter vibes in here. Afterall, Halloween is right around the corner, and what better way to put you in the mood than a Harry Potter themed coffeehouse?",

Day old, super dry, over toasted bread topped with properly ripe avocado but a rubbery, extremely over cooked egg (no liquid yolk) shaped like the toast all sitting in a puddle of balsamic reduction.  Perhaps an attempt to rehydrate the bread?  Ended up eating just the avocado that was shielded from the balsamic drizzle by the egg and toast, and tossing the rest.

Upon entering you notice the red velvety draped curtains and how nicely dim lit it is inside. Nice touch separating the what seems like a portal into an out of Las Vegas experience.   The interior design is very impressionable and it has a bit of a cabin like feel, but also like the train station feel with the faux bricks and platform 9 3/4 sign. The interior decoration is very well designed, It is obviously based / inspired by Harry Potter, while still tastefully executed, not risking a lawsuit but it is in theme enough so you get that it's being emulated, while if for whatever reason were to change theme the style would still work as a boxy industrial style coffee shop. This looks like it would live in the wizardly world without being an overkill theme of Harry Potter, hogwarts houses and colors not like cheesy but modern and even a death eater hidden in the corner hovering above the Dr Who phone booth. It is fairly quiet inside despite having most of the tables occupied, nice ambiance.   Parking was also easy to find near by as it is in a large enough lot, does close a bit earlier than I would have liked, would be awesome if it were open later for students, the studious, side hustlers, and self employed freelancers, who work at night, I imagine it must look even more magical and in theme in the fall time.  It totally looks unlike anything else out here, and they have good food aside drinks which is always a plus for deciding whether to work some where since we usually stay a while and like to try a few things through out our productive coffee hangs.   The blended rose coffee hit the spot it is not overly sweet but tasty and effective in waking up your senses, and the avocado toasts aren't overly sauced that you can't taste the avocado, the prosciutto and honey drizzle was a pleasantly surprising combination of sweet and savory. Looking forward to returning next time.",

I really liked this place, and have no doubt that I will be back.  I paid just under $6 for a large cold brew coffee. While it was on the more expensive side, I'm all for supporting independent places with smooth and great tasting coffee!  And, my gosh, it looks they have a lot of really good food options and lots of seating, too!  Bad Owl should be called Great Owl because it's just that--great!  Take it from this UNLV professor, overall grade, A-.  While they have lots of tables and chairs, most of them are terrible for big booty folks like myself. Fortunately they have a bench and a few big arm chairs. Do away with the silver table chairs. While they look cool, they aren't very comfortable. Regardless, I will gladly be back to this adorable local coffee and lunch shop that I'm sad I only now discovered.   Oh, they have free wi-fi! And I did see several outlets in case you need to recharge your devices while working or playing on the internet.",

I find this place more relaxing since the lighting is much more dim and intimate. Seating is also more comfortable, and noise level is at a minimal as well. I don't need to use my earphones to concentrate.   Drink menu is phenomenal and staff is very friendly and attentive. They bring your drinks to ya, which was very nice.",

(From some meme she found online)  I did get the everything avocado toast. It was good but it was pretty large and the bread was thick that I just ended up eating the top of it and leaving the bread. The prices are pretty steep and I can't say I would be back unfortunately. But it might work for you....",

    "text": "I needed a place to get some work done and the Harry Potter thing basically convinced me. Here was my experience on a Thursday afternoon.  AMBIANCE: Parking: It's a popping plaza but you shouldn't have issues.  Seating:  Paired seating or small group seating with space for about 40-50 people.  Feels: The plaza itself is busy with other shops and everyday errand business places. The coffesshop itself takes you to another world. You're in a Harry Potter themed shop and it does it justice as it's decordated from top to bottom with good photo op spots. I entered the semi-lit space with pleasant warm Christmas music and comfy scents of coffee. Though it may be a tourist spot you can still get work done.  FOOD: Butterbeer (Recommend) Butter and caramel served fresh and warm. I enjoyed the sweetness to it as it satisfied my caffeine needs.  CUSTOMER SERVICE:  Excellent. They were energized, helpful, and quick.  TL; DR OVERALL: 4 Stars. For all you Harry Potter nerds, this is your spot. The price is reasonable, the menu was clever, and the experience was pleasant. It's a spot I recommend if you're looking for something different outside of the Las Vegas Strip.  TIPS: * This spot is no hidden gem so this spot can get packed during conventional times * Discount for iced drink if you Yelp check-in!",

The egg of the breakfast croissant was perfectly prepared.  I am looking forward to going back and trying some of the other coffee and other menu items.  I hope this place opens a second location because it is a bit of a far travel if you do not live in Henderson.",

They have good dairy alternatives and I love that since I cannot have dairy, it's very helpful. Whatever you do DONT GO TO MOTHERSHIP COFFEE ROASTERS. Save your time and drive over here to Bad Owl. You actually get great customer service and a great coffee. Plus the baristas actually try and talk to you which is awesome I love meeting people and getting to know about other barista since I am one myself. Trying new coffee and getting a GOOD coffee is hard. So I will always support this this business and you should too if you ever visit or live in Las Vegas!   Thank you guys for the awesome coffee!!!!",

My reason for docking a star was due to the fact that their menu seemed very limited although the drinks were really good they didn't wow me. The service was also pretty slow even though we were the only ones ordering anything and they no orders prior to ours.   I definently recommend this place for a chat, a study session, or a good place to rest and read. I'll be coming back at some point and I hope to try out other things on their menu",

I really love the decorations and rustic feel to the place. Out of all the food and drinks, my favorite thing has to be the butterbrew whipped cream. I mean, come on! BUTTERBREW WHIPPED CREAM! It doesn't get better than that! On top of that the waffles were crunchy and very delicious! The perfect thing to eat with the oh so amazing butterbrew whipped cream. The cream sodas were okay. I've had better, I've had worse. But then again, it's a coffee shop not a cream soda shop so I'll let it slide. I really look forward to coming back again.

It is a quaint little place with a few picnic benches and some round tables. Cute 9 3/4 decorations abound!  The wait was long, but the people behind the counter were as nice as can be!  I went with my husband, sister, and cousin- so we pushed two tables together. I ordered citrus mint tea and it came in it's own tea pot! I also ordered the avocado toast (I had had it the last time I was here, so I kind of knew what to expect).   The tea was piping hot and was delicious! The avocado toast was decent. The bread was crazy hard so very difficult to cut, which I don't remember being the case last time, so that was a little bummer. There was a ton of avocado which I so appreciated. The balsamic drizzle on the toast makes this dish!  Overall, a good experience for the second time, and we will be back!",

It's not over the top Harry Potter themed but subtle hints like the bookshelf in the back, random brooms, posters, and snitches hanging from the Christmas tree. I felt it was tastefully decorated for both kids and adults.   They have Harry Potter themed drinks and creations. I tried their signature latte - iced roasted almond latte. This latte was so tasty! There was actually tiny bits of crushed almonds in my drink so I knew it was homemade and not all fake syrup. I love that taste of roasted almonds and it came through. The drink was not overly sweet but still had some sweetness. I would definitely recommend! I was very satisfied sitting in my armchair and enjoying this coffee. All I needed was a fire like I was sitting in the common room in Hogwarts. Come check out this place if you are a fan of Harry Potter or just want good coffee!",

Butter coffee was ok, it was good enough for a 9 year old but she was disappointed that she couldn't see tables decorated.

    "text": "I visited Bad Owl a couple days after the opening. Let me preface this by saying I have never watched a Harry Potter film.  The decor was very impressive. Everything is tasteful, the flow is perfect and there is adequate seating (assuming the buzz isn't always this high). I enjoyed that they were able to incorporate the Potter theme, without alienating outsiders who have never watched the films.  The coffee was well balanced. I ordered an Americano and it was a perfect blend of acidity and smoothness. A little cream really brought out the rich flavor. I'd put the quality on par with Mothership, but the espresso is a bit less acidic if that is your thing.  The negative: The line was insanely long. I knew what I was getting into when I pulled up and the line was out the door. Being as I am an Americano drinker, specialty coffees don't jump out at me, so I can honestly say I wouldn't wait in a line this long again for another cup. However, Henderson isn't exactly filled with high end coffee bars, so I wouldn't mind waiting 10-15 mins on a leisurely day. The only knock I have, is that the staff isn't adequate at the moment for the traffic it's generating. A single cashier and 2 baristas isn't the most efficient setup.  While the line was an inconvenience, I can't deduct any stars. I wish a business nothing but success, and hope that the lines always remain. For my selfish reasons however, I'd consider this a regular haunt if the buzz ever dies down.",

    "text": "I wish I could like this place, I really do. It's cute, service is good, but it's not enough to come back.  We got this coconut latte drink, and the more you drank it, the more it tasted like sunscreen. There are coconut beverages out there that taste like natural coconut, this wasn't one of them.   I got the matcha affogato and it looked appealing but it didn't taste right. The matcha sauce was off somehow and the ice cream under it clashed, so while we thought it was vanilla, we realized it couldn't have been.   I decided to give it a third shot and ordered a lavender latte. I drink many lavender drinks, caffeine and alcohol. One of my go to drinks is a London fog, I drink a lot of tea and coffee in general. So this lavender latte was different, it was a coffee latte with what I'm guessing was some lavender extract, the flavors did not blend well at all. I kept drinking it hoping it would get better, but it got worse the more I kept trying to force it.  This is partially my fault for not asking if this were a tea latte or an espresso one, but at the same time I've seen places put together some really weird combos and pull it off where the flavors complement each other.  I think this drink could be improved as a lavender tea latte.  Something we considered was the fact that we kept trying to order fancy things off the menu that sounded intriguing and played off the things we already liked. Their normal, non fancy, drinks might actually be alright. I kind of wish I tried something simple like a vanilla latte or a cappuccino to try this place out, since it was new to us. But 3 out of 3 orders were discarded instead of finished, despite our best efforts.  As for the decor, for a themed coffee shop it feels minimal. There are some nice touches, there is even a tardis door which was adorable (and unrelated), but I know some friends who are hardcore into the Harry Potter fandom who've decorated their own homes with more memorabilia.  If I hadn't known this was an HP themed coffee shop before walking in I wouldn't have known at first glance. I would have gotten it after ordering, sitting down, and looking around for a few minutes and then going ohhh. I don't know if there are copyright rules holding the shop back, but even displaying consumer available merch would help the theme go a lot further. Also, there was no inside seating so we sat at one of the two tables outside, which wasn't so bad on that particular day, but we just reached triple digit heat this week as I write this.  The place seems popular with students, or some groups of teenagers / young 20 somethings squatting in decent sized groups for a decent period of time while sipping drinks. More seating would be helpful to account for them.  1 star for coffee, 1 star for theme, it's the service that got it to 3.   I live on the opposite side of town. There's really no reason for me to come back, or stop by if I'm visiting the east side. Really, we wanted to like this place more.  I'm hoping they see this review and consider these points, I hope they can implement some changes to improve their drinks more than anything, and maybe I'll give it another shot later in the future.",

    "text": "I've been searching Henderson for a coffee place that isn't a chain and doesn't feel like it's in a strip mall. For those from Las Vegas it might not be obvious why that would be a goal, because here, mall and strip mall vibes tend more to be the rule than the exception--but for people who love or accustomed to thriving downtowns and like to support high-quality locally and independently owned shops, restaurants, cafes, cute coffee nooks, and other businesses, you will completely adore Bad Owl Coffee. And so will anyone else, as far as I can imagine!  A rare and refreshing cultural, aesthetic, oasis.   It is in a strip mall -- but that's totally ok, and feels worlds away.  The interior is at once handsome, airy, and welcoming.  The walls are a mix of barn siding and what looks like grey brick, and the floors are super nice wide-plank wood.  This is one of the first places I've been here without fluorescent lighting (with the exception of spendy posh restaurants) -- instead there's very hip/sleek but at the same time vintage/rustic lighting fixtures that look like something....maybe out of Harry Potter? And guess what? If you haven't already gathered...this is a Harry Pottered themed coffeeshop. What?! Yes, seriously.   Harry Potter isn't something that's ever been my thing, but that's ok -- not a requirement -- but if you are, there are lots of cool little references (e.g., sign above the kitchen:  Wizards Welcome --Muggles Tolerated-- ).  The latte is the best I've found since leaving San Francisco. The \"Charmingly Pesto\" sandwich -- ciabatta bread, chicken chunks, garden-fresh pesto, juicy avocado, roasted red peppers, melty cheese -- was outstanding.   Air conditioned to the *perfect* temperature on this 115 degree day -- which is saying something, since many places here are cooled to the painful temperature of a meat locker.  Strong wifi and good tunes -- super friendly, helpful, kind, and knowledgeable staff -- what more could you want, really?    I live about 4 miles away, but suspect this will be my go-to spot herein.",

    "text": "Met up with some friends here after a Harry Potter convention in Vegas.   The cafe is also Harry Potter themed, which is awesome!   They have themed food and drinks, Harry Potter books, a platform 9 3/4 (although for legal reasons theirs says 9 6/8), Harry Potter quotes and related things on the tables, and a sign in the back pointing to all the different places in the books.   It's a relatively small cafe, but really nice to just hang out in and talk over coffee.   I had the sea salt iced coffee. It was a bit disappointing because I didn't taste any sea saltiness or caramel for that matter. I did taste the butter brews and those were amazing. Also had the Charmingly Pesto sandwich, which was surprisingly good albeit a bit expensive.   It did get quite crowded here when we came and there is only one register, which seems like a bit of an issue. They should really take drink orders in advance of the register like they do at Starbucks.   Overall though I'd definitely recommend this place to Harry Potter fans and mildly interested coffee fans. ;)",

I love strong coffee and this coffee is super rich and balances out nicely with sweet cream and a dash of salt. I also tried their veggie sandwich and cream of mushroom soup-they tasted amazing!  I like Harry Potter but I'm not obsessed. I have to say the decor was cute, but certainly not as elaborate as expected. They have the Platform 9 3/4 prop set up along a faux brick wall and some Harry Potter phrases painted on the table, but not a whole lot else. Still a cute place though.  The staff are super friendly too! The only con is the items are a little pricey, but it's worth it because the coffee is great and you're supporting a local joint!",

    "text": "I finally made my visit to Bad Owl Coffee.  Bad Owl Coffee opened up not too terribly long ago in Henderson as a Harry Potter themed coffee shop.  Naturally, I was intrigued.  There is a line.  Hoo boy, there is a line.  People love their Potter.  But to their credit, they kept the line moving continually.  The place is decked out with all things Hogwarts (and a TARDIS, but I'm not one to complain. My British pop culture love has many facets), and it's done very well.  The place does look nice.  The references are both numerous and subtle (loved the owl cage), so whether you're a fan of Harry Potter or just coffee in general, it works both ways.  After hearing so much about it, I decided to try the Butterbrew latte, and it was really good, and went well with the chocolate pastry that I had.  We only stayed a little bit, as seating is limited, and we wanted to be fair to the still growing line of coffee hopefuls, so the missus and I ate our breakfast, and went on our way.  We plan on going back in the near future.  It's in Henderson, so it's a bit of a drive for us, but I'd love to come back and check out the place without the crowds (if/when that eventually happens).  I really enjoyed the coffee, the service, and the overall atmosphere.  It's fandom tastefully done, and the nods make it a fun experience past your average coffee spot.  (I expect they will be nuts to visit when the next book and movie come out.)",

The former was mediocre -- only slightly better than what you'd get at a Coffee Bean or a Starbucks. The cold brew was good. Still, I greatly prefer a cup of fresh pour-over and was disappointed they weren't doing any, despite V60 being on the menu. Unless a big Harry Potter fan is visiting from out of town, I won't be going back.",

It was actually both our first time there so he decided to get the butter brew latte w/espresso since its been a hype and I got the biscoff latte. I was impressed with the biscoff latte, it was really lavorful that you could re taste the cookie butter which was surprisingly not too sweet at all. As for the butter brew latte the boyfriend wasn't really impressed. You couldn't really taste the flavor of the butterscotch which was disappointing but Im sure it had to do with the espresso being added to it. Hoping nxt time we will give it a try without the espresso.",

If you are hoping to enjoy a cup of coffee -- or butterbeer latte -- in the surroundings of Harry Potter lore, look no further!  At a quick glance it looks like a normal cafe, but on closer inspection you see all the small touches. The tables with quotes and spells from the books... the sign post with all the locations from the HP world... a brick wall with a Platform 9 3/4 sign hanging down, Headwig about to go through with the luggage... a reading nook with all seven books stacked neatly, waiting to be read... the menu loaded with HP references. This place is a dream.  I am happy to report that years after the last book and movie have been released, the cafe was packed with people in the middle of a weekday. Some were even dressed in Cosplay. :) But beware, it was packed with people. We waited in line for about 20 to order. The staff were very friendly and the coffee was great as well. I got a Butterbeer Latte with a shot of espresso (it is coffee free despite its name). Yum!  Mischief managed.",

I had the pistachio iced latte it was amazing and very strong . We had yummy cookie butter waffles, (they took forever to make our food), small portions of food but actually it was just enough in the end. Iam giving this place 3 stars because, my waffles were served with ice cream; one big scoop just sitting there on my PLATE OF FOOD melting away all over my waffles. They did not offer me a spoon, so im sitting there, eating ice cream on a plate with a fork! At there prices we shouldn't have to beg for silverware. The employees are snooty. This place is a good idea in theory i just don't think its there yet. Im gonna keep trying tho, i will be back.",

If there's a place to feel remotely like a (ravenclaw) HP student, it's here right?   As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by the nice baristas and warm scent of brewing coffee. The walls and tables were decorated with HP quotes and spells and kind of reminded me of Potions class with the overall dark color scheme. However, I immediately noticed the Doctor Who phone box on the right corner of the shop. I am a huge Whovian so I definitely appreciated it, but it was awkwardly placed and kind of random?!   As for the coffee, I of course tried the famous butter beer latte. I mean you can't go wrong with their signature drink? Wrong. It literally tasted like hot milk with caramel drizzling and a HINT of coffee.  Overall, if you're going for the ambiance and nostalgia of HP, it's worth a visit - just make sure to greet the DW phone box on your way out lol. As for the coffee, it's a bit underwhelming and you'd be better off elsewhere.",

The place recently opened, and a lot of the employees aren't very experienced with making beverages. As a Starbucks partner, I understand first and foremost what it's like to be a brand new barista. There's A LOT of pressure, and it's extremely fast-paced. Because this is a newer coffee shop with, I imagine, employees with little to no coffee experience, there WILL be a wait and some confusion. To everyone complaining about the wait, we were ALL new somewhere at some point. Cut them some slack.  As for the quality of the beverages, absolutely outstanding. I got a blended Nutella with no espresso, and it was great. I got a chocolate-covered macaron, too, and I would like to try the other flavors sometime.

It was being passed around on a clipboard.   Being a die hard HP fan, I wanted to check this place out badly. I was highly disappointed. There were maybe 7-10 things of HP in there. They just threw the decorations and said they were a HP themed coffee shop. Needless to say, I have bigger plans for a HP themed nursery room for my unborn baby.   However, their coffee was delicious! I love coffee shops like this that truly have good wholesome coffee and they have nailed that!",

    "text": "2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     22/100  First heard about this place through Facebook. I went a week or two after their soft opening... hopefully to avoid the long lines, but when we got there was a long line out the door. haha! DUH. Come on, Michelle. Definitely a good sign for them. Luckily, I was with my favorite people and we got to catch up on a few things.   Anyways, I'm not a huge Harry Potter fan, but the friends I was with are. I was excited to try this place out because I love coffee and tea and I love businesses with a creative twist.   When we finally got inside, the decor was amazing. Harry Potter theme was well executed, a spot for HP fans to pose for their social media photos. Even though I'm not a HP fan, I loved the decor. They also had fresh orchids by the register, one of my favorite flowers.   There were also bakery items and healthy snacks, bananas and fruit near the register. Nice touch, great for healthy foodies.   I ordered the Lavender Latte, this one I was excited to try because after reading their menu online, I found out it's made with housemade lavender. As I ordered, I asked if there was any way to make it less sweet or no sugar as I was watching my sugar intake because of health reasons, borderline diabetes. The cashier had no idea how to answer the question. Ok, understandable. They were still working out the kinks.  I forgot to ask if they could just make it as a tea and not a latte.   It wasn't bad, but I had to sip it slowly. It was still sweet for my taste. Plus, they used Vitamin D whole milk (it has tons of sugar). I tried the Butterbeer Latte but it was my first time trying it so I can't compare to the real deal Butterbeer. My lavender didn't have any tea leaves in it, but my friend's drink did. I had no desire to finish mine, and I must have wasted half the latte.   Disappointed with the drinks and service, my friends have went back several times and the drinks still need work, so I'll come back when they are more experienced. I'll still recommend to Harry Potter fans, and friends and family from out of town.",

I wanted to order some breakfast but since it was so busy I skipped it. Seriously, every chair in there had a bum in it. It got loud, which I don't like when I'm in a coffee shop so I left.

I was surprised to find out their lattes don't actually contain expresso. That's an extra cost and the last time I checked a latte has expresso in it. So I was put off by this because you can't call a latte a latte without expresso. It's called a steamer if it has no expresso in it. Just saying. This seems like False advertisement or the owners don't know anything about lattes/coffee. I don't know that I will return. I can get better coffee else where and actually get a latte that actually has expresso it in without paying extra.",

Inside, the interior was dim, with Harry Potter themed tables, and decor on the wall. Upon arrival everyone was friendly, and I already knew what I wanted ( Obviously the butter beer latte). They write your name on your cup like Starbucks, there was two sizes 12 or - 16 oz hot. I opted for the 16 oz, flavor wise - the butter beer latte is like a melted butterscotch flavor mixed in with espresso. I was happy with my choice, came in around early afternoon wasn't so busy, and got my latte fairly quick. Happy with the service, they didn't make fun of me for being a dork, taking photos of the place. Haha I will definitely be back if I'm on that side of town or if I have an itching for butter beer. ;) They also have a stamp card, so even better for a coffee mama.",

Anyway, the wife and I came here for coffee so let's talk about that. First of all great customer service with a hello and how do you do. Also genuine conversation in this day and age is a dying art. Questions about the menu were answered pleasantly and with knowledge. When I saw their menu, I knew that the wife was getting one of their signature flavored lattes. And she did just that with the coconut latte while I went with the Kyoto cold brew which they make with a special contraption that work with gravity to slowly drip one drop at a time slowly making for a highly concentrated brew. My coffee was certainly high on flavor and caffeine and I should be good for a while before needing another caffeine pick me up. Again the atmosphere was nice and clearly has a lot of Harry Potter things going on, but also some good tunes blaring. The wife and I have already planned future visits on this trip alone. I even enjoyed her coconut latte which means a lot coming from me.",

I got the butter beer with a shot of espresso (it's a flavored milk steamer otherwise aka no espresso in the original drink) and it was pretty good! Butterscotch flavor I think, and milk was steamed well with nice quality layer of foam on top. Good fundamental speciality espresso drink making :)   Also got an aero press for the Ethiopian blend which was super smooth and delicious.   The almond croissant and other baked goods are from Bonjour. the almond croissant was gigantic but served with a fork and knife which I never needed for a croissant before but needed it for this one.   I love the ambience of the cafe too. Free wifi, plenty of seating, good natural light so it's a perfect place to get some work done.   The service was very friendly and knowledgable too. Gave me good recommendations on coffee and came by to check up on me while I was seated.   Also the light Harry Potter theme was super cute. Not overdone and added a wonderfully cute touch.

They are also brilliant at their jobs, making the best tea, coffee, latte, sandwich, avacado toast - whatever it is - it's delicious! They are very consistent in their excellent service which is part of the reason why my sis and I visit so frequently. Aside from that, if you are a Harry Potter fan, you have to stop in! Bad Owl is decorated with the coolest decor that makes you feel like you are right inside of the books and movies. It's a real treat. Another thing about Bad Owl is the great music! Every time we go in, the playlists are just perfect which makes for an even more amazing atmosphere. Bad Owl is magically, truly. You have to go! I promise you will not regret it.",

    "text": "I absolutely love this place!  As a huge harry potter fan, the phrases/words on each table made me chuckle as some of them brought back memories of the story.  I had the Roasted Almond latte which was made with small bits of crushed almonds which was very different to me and I loved it! The owners Annie and Yuzo were very friendly and attentative on my order.  I mentioned that I had to limit my carbs and sweets so they gave me options of almond milk, soy milk, less sugar, etc.  It didn't have a syrupy, artificial flavor taste but instead a very natural almond taste plus small almond pieces per swig.  Not something I was used to but I much, much prefer this now.  My best friend had the jade green tea latte and her description was perfect, \"this is exactly what a green tea latte should taste like.\"  Her husband had the V60 (euthiaopian) and loved it.  The caffeine definitely woke him up but it tasted smooth and wasn't overpowring.  The atmosphere was very relaxing.  It's lightly lit inside so it had a nice, calm, relaxing and \"chill\" ambience.  Excellent place to bring a small group of friends to talk the afternoon away or to pick up a quick drink.  They also have snacks and pastries if you get hungry!",

My friend didn't like her coffee because she thought it was supposed to be warm, so they gladly switched it for her. I ordered the Mandarin Silk tea with soy milk and honey! It was delish, it has a very light, vanilla flavor. A little honey makes it perfectly sweet.   There wasn't as much Harry Potter decor as I thought there'd be...it's pretty simple, like you don't instantly think \"this is a Harry Potter themed place\" until you see Harry's owl. They just had a few quotes from the movies and a Platform 9 and 6/8...(Yes, 6/8..I wondered what was up with that, lol.) The workers also offered us Easter eggs with candy because of the holiday! :)",

The layout is a *teeny* bit awkward and cramped but the dark, mysterious/magical aesthetics totally make up for it (HP fans: think of a classy, spiffed up version of the Leaky Cauldron, and you'll understand).   I personally loved the coffee I've tried. A bit overpriced but it's still good. I have tried the Black forest mocha latte, blackberry white mocha latte, and the lavender white mocha latte. All delicious   Definitely worth a try, but due to price and location I can't frequent it as much as I'd like, but it's perfect for a weekend day when you can tromp around and enjoy the experience",

The place is small, the lines are long and it doesn't even have Harry Potter stuff.   I've gone there multiple times and have liked the coffee less and less. The flavoring is always inconsistent when I go unless Mike or Teddy are making it. They do a good job and take instructions pretty well.  I like their grilled cheese sandwich but that's about it. So, I only go to this coffee shop for their food.. weird.   The staff is very nice so that is their plus 1 star.",

The lavender latte was almost savory but didn't have a good flavor. It was also not hot but more luke warm. The chai tea latte was a basic chai. The butter brew latte was super sweet. The sizes are ridiculous for the price. Their large is like a Starbucks medium and the lids don't fit on the iced drink cups. They leak all over. It hangs over like a sombrero. Beware of tipping.  I selected no tip but it charged three dollars tip. On top of already expensive drinks. The large drinks we ordered (really more like medium drinks) were almost six dollars a piece. Honestly I would skip. Our group is composed of huge Harry Potter fans but we wouldn't go back. It doesn't even feel Harry Potter themed.",

Well, it's pretty far from where we are (Summerlin), but we were close, so we finally got to stop by!  First impression, ooo! And then, as i kept looking around, it was very underwhelming. There's a cute spot with the platform 9 3/4 (but it was actually written as a 9 6/8 lol) with luggage and Hedwig sitting on top. And I'm the corner there's more suitcases with the Harry Potter book collection there.. But that's it!  If it were me..... I would have the coffee bar at the back of the shop, and have long long tables running the length of the restaurant. And chandeliers of different heights hanging from the ceiling as if they were floating.. But that's just me.  As for coffee, I ordered the sea salt ice coffee and it was just OK. Tasted watered down. Not a fan.   I probably won't come back all this way to come here for the coffee, but its good to have experienced it.",

The whole theme is very unique - an intimate, modern coffee shop with a nice classy touch of Harry Potter decorations all around! My boyfriend and I went here on Valentine's Day & surprisingly it wasn't too busy, but we were a bit saddened by the fact that they already ran out of the Butter Beer Latte! But it was expected since it was their grand opening weekend. What I did like was the fact that they gave us a sample of the Kyoto Cold Brew & the Nitrogen Cold Brew before making our decision!   We ended up ordering the Matcha Latte and the BF ordered the White Mocha Blend. Both were absolutely delicious & would highly recommend!  We live in Summerlin so the drive is pretty far but it sure is worth it! If only they could open a shop in Summerlin, I would definitely be there everyday!

Anyways, the wait was long the aroma smelt of burnt coffee beans and when the highly anticipated coffee product arrived to our table my expectations were let down. The pistachio nut latte tasted like cheap amaretto coffee creamer with a hint of potpourri and the mocha latte made Tru Moo taste like Godiva! Not a fan of the place, decor, wait, price or product.

    "text": "So disappointed. Coffee was mediocre. Decor was awful. If you're going to advertise as a Harry Potter themed coffee shop have more than just a stack of suitcases and a sign hanging. It was a whole bunch of missed opportunities. Waiting in line for 15 minutes just to order and then having it ready immediately made no sense. There was only one person behind the counter that seemed to know what he was doing. My boyfriend ordered the cold brew coffee, then was told there wasn't enough. Then he ordered the nitro and had to wait even longer because it ran out. It was just such a disappointment.",

    "text": "So I've been there a few times already and it's just ok. Some of the staffing there is not too familiar with Harry Potter. The drinks are pretty good, but are always running out of butterbrew and I don't think it's worth the 30+ minute wait. If you want to go there for the pastries, don't go there when it opens. The company they go through for their pastries is not opened at that time and they won't be there to make their delivery until after 7:30am. I have also noticed that when you walk in when it opens, they're not really prepared. They're still setting up the menus, register, equipment and their nitrogen coffee was not even setup yet. I think they may have opened a little too early and it looks like they didn't learn too much from the soft opening.   I love to support local businesses, but it looks like they need to clean it up a bit. I will try again in about a month and see if there has been any changes. It's interesting to see how they will do once Starbucks opens up in the same shopping center.",

    "text": "I went  to Bad Owl Coffee for the first time today with high expectations and was sadly disappointed. I ordered a drink and was given the wrong size, the barista kindly accepted fixed the mistake. When I was given the correct size the server had an air of self entitlement, which is probably why she is stuck in the back making drinks and not at the register. The drinks were good and there was a lot of diversity, but it's nothing that knocked my socks off. They don't do refills for house coffee, which was shocking, since most places do (even if there is a minimal fee). It was a little bit more on the pricey side. Personally as a Harry Potter fan, I was happy with the subtle accents of memorabilia. The one thing about the shop was that the temperature inside was hot. Would maybe go again to try another drink, but probably not.",

He didn't ask if I wanted anything else so I said I will also get a breakfast sandwich . He said ok pick up coffee here and will bring sandwich out to me. Some of the details noted : Coffee is ok , Luke warm, the foam is thick and half sweet was plenty , I can't imagine full sugary syrup. Breakfast sandwich ready , called my name instead to have me get up from my table. Not impressed with the portion size for the price I paid, I will be positive of the fact that I am on mini cut so this would prevent me from consuming more calories . He gave me a fork and a spoon instead of a knife for the sandwich , not to mention the menu included fruit or yogurt with my sandwich which I didn't receieve.  Sandwich is ok little salty for me, if your salt sensitive, ask for no salt on the eggs since ham and cheddar cheese is already salty enough.  I didn't even bother asking for my missing fruit,  at this point the place just rubbed me the wrong way. (I was in good mood prior to coming here) What's with the Harry Potter theme? Didnt strike me as appealing to all customer base. If you like to study at coffee shops, I don't think the layout is the best for studying for few hours here. Overall if it wasn't for Groupon I would not come back again.",

Being on television is no excuse from a business standpoint. If the owners have to be away, have an employee in charge who can keep the place open or have the television folks come to you. Given the distance, I doubt any of us will be back.",

I went in there and the closest thing on the menu to anything harry potter was the butter brew which they were out of, of course! But they made me a close substitute ans it was delcious:) however, i hope that given time and a rise in revenue will broaden their horizons on the theme, it was kind of plain to me and theres so much you can do with the theme they chose. Overall, coffee was good but not something i cant get anywhere else and the theme was lacking just a bit but its still worth a shot to anyone who needs a coffee or is a harry potter fanatic like myself:)",

They also have different types of milk if you're not into the regular kind.   The boyfriend and I shared a cookie butter waffle, which comes with 4 quarters of a whole waffle, a scoop of vanilla ice cream, and cookie butter spread, maple syrup, and butter. It was really satisfying. It was sorta pricy though, $9.50.   The table tops of all the tables here have different quotes or sayings on it. Most are very Punny!

    "text": "I've only been here three times.  1st time: It was on a Saturday and we arrived around 8:20pm, they close at 9pm. Everything was great! Food (we shared Belgian Waffle Buttercream), coffee (but not a big fan of the cold nitro brew, but loved the Roasted Almond Latte), the staff, the ambience...  I was so happy and satisfied. I told my Husband that I want to come back the next day and bring my parents and our baby. 2nd time: Sunday (the next day), we got there around 6:40pm, not knowing that they close at 7pm on weekdays. So we all decided to just order to go. We came inside and both of them behind the counter had an uninviting look. I showed my parents the menu and ask them which one they want. It took them a bit to decide as they can barely read the worn out menu. Again, saw the faces of both people behind the counter with their unfriendly look. So we finally ordered our coffee and the Belgian Waffle Buttercream, but the guy told us that their kitchen closes 30 minutes prior to clossing. Devastated....  If they're not going to be happy to have customers close to their closing time, then why don't they just close the shop early then? Since they no longer have customers inside anyway. Also, seriously? Kitchen closes 30 minutes prior to closing? Then just close the whole shop 30 minutes early. Newsflash: do they know that coffee drinkers are not just teenagers and/or people under 30? My parents are 60+, they love to try new coffee flavors, that's why they came with us, so I'm sorry if it took awhile for my parents to order, being new customers and unfamiliar with the menu. Maybe if they invest on a better menu that can't get worn out easily. Even I, can barely read the tiny worn out letters on the menu. 3rd time: I insisted to come back here because I love the coffee and the food, even though it left a bad impression to my Husband, since we're moving to southwest LV area and it might take us a long time before we can come back. The staff were nicer this time but they can improve on being more upbeat (like, hey! Welcome! We love new business and we like everyone!) rather than dull (like hey.. welcome. I'm glad you're here but I don't care if you leave since we're already successful and we got a lot of regulars here already).",

You know how people are before they get their drip so being overly peppy would have been over kill, but the people behind the counter are just the right amount of friendly and happy.   I could tell from looking around watching other people snap pictures that this little spot was Yelp worthy.

    "text": "Bad Owl Coffee is a coffee shop themed after \"Harry Potter\" its bound to tickle any Harry Potter fan to a frenzy after all they do have Butterbeer Lattes.  The latte itself was pretty good it wasn't as sweet as I though it would be, and it had a Butterscotch creamy flavor.  Unfortunately, the rest of the food and beverage wasn't as fantasy themed as I hoped it would be. By no means does that diminish, the quality of the coffees they taste awesome.   The almond latte, is made with real almonds and the Nutella Latte is chocolaty with a hint of roasted hazelnuts.    Bad Owl Coffee also has an expansive tea menu, as well as, desserts, pastries and sandwiches I haven't tried any of the food yet but I couldn't pass up the desserts.   The chocolate lava cake is so luscious and decadent easily one of the best desserts I've eaten. The cake is not made in house but they receive them fresh by a local company Terri Sue Cakes.   The ambiance is decorated nicely, set up after the scene of Platform 9 3/4 train station. Also a cool statue of Hedwig the Owl and a stack Harry Potter Book collection.  It's pleasant cafe environment to chat with friends. The staff are nice people and deliver good service my only thing is when it's busy it can get disorganized. It's still a new shop, so I'm sure they'll work out the kinks.",

I'll start by saying I'm not a coffee snob. In fact a thick cup of the 7-11 junk is usually good enough for me. This was very tasty but it's hard for me to pay primo prices for coffee.

The only reason I knocked off 1 star is because we ordered the lavender white mocha, which I was pretty excited to try especially since the girl taking our order hyped it up as well. But as soon as I tasted it, there was not even a hint of lavender, and it just tasted like a basic mocha coffee. It's a very calm environment and could definitely see me coming back to try other items and just do some work there because it isn't too insane or loud, at least not when I went.",

It was super crowded, hard to find a seat but Kayla was beaming with excitement! So many HP things, she was in heaven. They take your order and leave you to find a seat on your own. We waited a few minutes and found a wobbly table and two chairs. The guy next to my granddaughter was using the F word every-other-word, I was surprised he didn't know how to tone it down. Now Bad Owl's fault but did affect my visit. Way too much food, on top of a wobbly table. Food was super fancy for a 12 year old and cost me $35 so yeah we got to see the few Harry Pottery themed items and left. It was worth it for the butter beer (it's not beer) some Harry Potter concoction. I wished they would have recommended we split a sandwich or said something about a tiny person ordering something that was going to come out super big - but yeah have to say I am glad we went but won't be a regular.",

We came here on a Sunday morning which it was super busy. We sat a table which said \"Espresso Patronum\" and admired all the the Harry Potter decor. It was super cute. We ordered the Butterbrew, a take on our favorite drink, Butterbeer. We also ordered the Ava Ricotta toast and the Butterbrew Waffle. The Butterbrew and Ava Ricotta toast was AMAZING!!!!! 5 STARS! The Butterbrew waffle was good, maybe 3 stars for the waffle because it tasted like a cheap, soggy waffle, but the butter brew cream was 5 stars!!! Would still get again! The price was pretty expensive too, about $30 for 2 large butterbrews, the toast, and waffle, but worth it!!!! I will be back! Thank you Bad Owl for an awesome experience!",

If you're a fan you'll want to check this place out. Even if you aren't a fan, you'll enjoy the food and beverages and industrial chic vibe here.  The Siriusly Prosciutto was the best food item we tried. The waffles and veggie quiche were both very good as well. My only issue is that when cutting the quiche or waffles the paper liner tore exposing my food to the plastic basket/metal tray below. I'm a little more conscious of germs than most people though so. .. All in all a DEFINITE 5 stars! Must visit!",

I ordered an unique, iced pistachio mocha latte.  The current yelp check-in offer is 20% off an iced or blended drink.  It was a mild and not too sweet latte which I fancy.  There are seasonal lattes as well which is always an added bonus on a menu.  The Harry Potter decor is a nice added touch and it goes with the dim lighting.  There is plenty of table seating and room to stand around and wait for your drink.  The baristas are friendly and knowledgeable.  This coffee shop is clean and the prices are reasonable.  I would glad to come back whenever I visit my hometown!",

I ordered the avocado toast and to my disappointment, they didn't have just regular drip coffee.  I like simple coffee, not the foo-foo, sugar filled drinks.  So I settled for the V60 Brazilian pour over.  My husband ordered just an espresso shot.    When I saw the price for a pour over, I already decided I wouldn't be returning unless the taste was absolutely amazing; it was close to $4 for a small cup.  As we waited for our order, I looked around at the place.  They clearly didn't have enough workers for the day.  Several tables hadn't been cleared off of garbage for over 20 minutes and the trash was filled to the brim (it stayed that way the whole time we were there).  The bar top we got stuck sitting at was filthy, had spills, stickiness and food crumbs.  When we finally got our order, it was 25 minutes later!!!  25 minutes for a damn cup of coffee; the food came out earlier.  My toast was decent and the coffee had a good taste to it.  With that being said, the cons far outweighed the pros.  The price, long wait, limited seating & overall dirtiness of the place allowed me to mark this place on my list as a 'one and done.'",

Ya girl was hyped when she picked up the clipboard menu at the register and read that there was a craft beer section.  I had a mental debate...well I'm here to do some homework... then the devil on my shoulder said \"but you did write your best papers in your undergrad under the influence.\" I gave in and decided to order a beer instead of a latte.   I asked the barista/bartender what his fave beer was, he mentioned something about a golden monkey, so I quickly replied, I'll take it! He rang me up and said that's $4 and some change, and our happy hour ends at 7pm. WHAT? Ya'll Harry Potter coffee slangers got a happy hour on craft beer? He replied with, yes its $2 off. I immediately decided that I will be coming here from now on instead of the Starbucks .02 miles away. Let's just say the beer had hints of banana and goodness.  Thank you Bad Owl! I was able to complete my work, drink some delicious beer, draft some wizardry within my homework and feel great all at the same time. I will definitely come back have a beer and try your coffee.",

    "text": "Like any Harry Potter fan, I was extremely excited to try this coffee shop.  I ordered their cookie butter latte after asking the barista about it's sweetness.  She told me that it is extremely sweet but that she would be able to make it half-sweet.  I often order flavored lattes half-sweet so I had no problem with this but here, this caused it to have no flavor whatsoever.  The coffee overall was mediocre, at best. The overall atmosphere is very well done and definitely captures the overall Harry Potter feel.  It's easy to tell they had some issues with copyright and had to be careful but the idea is still clear. The shop is pretty small.  On the Saturday afternoon when I went, tables were available but they are all so close together it's difficult to justify sitting for a conversation when the person next to you is clearly reading a book or studying.  The strip-mall location makes it difficult to have outdoor seating but I would probably visit again if they did.  Instead, it's pretty cramped. Overall, I think Bad Owl has done a good job of capturing the ambiance of Harry Potter and can certainly see why a hardcore fan would enjoy visiting.  I'm glad I checked it out once but, unfortunately, it's just not a great hang-out spot or a place to get the best coffee, especially not for the steep price you pay for visiting a tourist destination.",

We ordered the flight of the hippogryph which has 4 flavored espresso shots. While they were all delicious, we couldn't figure out which one was green and which one was blue. They weren't in order. My favorite of the 4 is definitely the yellow (Hufflepuff) butterbrew shot.  My sister's iced butterbrew latte was delicious. Tasted clean and sweet. You could definitely taste the butterscotch without it being syrupy. It had no coffee in it but they give you the option of adding an espresso shot.  My mom's Avado Ricotta was supperrrrrr yummy. Quite a large portion as well. It's 2 hearty pieces of toast with ricotta cheese, avocado, cilantro sauce, red pepper flakes, and lime on the side to squueze over it all. She loved it. So tasty.  Me and my sister ordered the Butterbrew Cream Belgian Waffle. It comes with a huge dollop of butterbrew cream, butter, and syrup. The waffle was crispy on the outside but soft to bite. The cream was outstanding. I recommend sprinkling a little salt on it. Brings everything out.  I would definitely come again. I want to try their sandwiches next. The lady next to me had one and it looked amazing.",

There was a young blonde woman taking the orders and she was rude, she has no personality and gives a bad vibe to the coffee shop. I ordered an iced coffee specifically with NO ICE, it was even written on the cup. When I go to get my coffee, it is only filled half way. I asked the barista if there's a reason why she didn't fill up my cup. She says \"you didn't want ice in it, so I left you space in case you wanted to add ice.\" Um, hello, the order said NO ICE, there's no reason for you to not fill up my coffee. I didn't pay $5 for you to fill up my cup half way. Then she has the audacity to say, \"do you want me to fill it for you?\" Of course I do. And all she does is add more creamer. So I paid more than $5 for almost no coffee and all milk in my cup. How horrible this place was at giving good customer service. I had higher expectations for this place. I left with a bad taste in my mouth. Disappointed to say the least.",

    "text": "I LOVE Harry Potter, especially the wizarding world that JK Rowling created. So when my friend told me about this coffee shop, it immediately became a must-do on my next Vegas trip.  But the experience was somewhat disappointing. It felt like the coffee shop was kinda just bandwagoning on the HP hype. They do have some cute HP-related decor, but I expected it to be more Harry-Potter like, but I guess they would probably run into some copyright issues. But it's also kinda confusing how they have the door to the TARDIS at the front of the store on the right...  There were a minimal selection of Harry Potter-inspired drinks, maybe more Sandwiches with Harry Potter-themed names which I didn't get to try.  I ordered the Butter Brew Latte with soy milk (damn my lactose-intolerance), which I hastily expected to be like Butterbeer, but it's not. I also ordered the Matcha Affogato, which comes with a lot of vanilla ice cream and some thick matcha. But I think I would've enjoyed pouring the matcha myself, which I always thought was half the fun of an affogato.  I think my favorite menu item would actually be the Flight of the Hippogriff under their Signatures section. It's 4 different espresso shooters, inspired by the four Houses at Hogwarts and each shooter has a different color and flavor. It may be a new item because I couldn't find it on their online menu or any of the pictures on Yelp. I was only able to try the coconut-flavored Slytherin shooter though (SLYTHERIN FOREVER!). It didn't taste super coconut-y but it was still good, and sweet.  Basically, this Harry Potter-inspired coffee shop is a little far off the Strip (which is where most tourists stay) for what it is to become a regular Vegas stop.",

I ordered the Boysenberry Mascarpone Toast with almonds, coconut nut and honey.  It sounds stupid sweet but there is a perfect balance of sweetness that will make you want to have a second order even though a single order is more than a normal human should eat.  Matt ordered the veggie quiche which could have been really bad or really good.  It was better than really good it was astonishingly good.  It was properly executed from the crust up.   The eggs were fluffy and light not over cooked the crust was flaky and not mealy and absolutely perfect.  The coffee was so much better than any starry-eyed chain.  It was roasted right and fabulously brewed.  I got the toffee as they don't have Carmel and loved every sip.  If you are ever near there you've got to give this place a try.  It's really, really worth the trip!",

Just the decor alone was delightful.  Super chill and quiet spot, great for studying, catching up with a friend, or potential first (nondate) date spot.   Bonus: they also serve wine and beer.  Did not have any of the food, but they looked like they had a nice menu of eats. Just had a plain iced coffee, and I liked it.   Would I come again? Sure!",

    "text": "This place is my go to coffee  shop.  Typically when I go to a new area I like to try all the independent coffee shops and I usually don't go back to them unless they make a huge impression and during my 2 week stay in the Las Vegas area I have been here a whopping 4x.   What initially drew me to this place is that it's Harry Potter themed. I absolutely love Harry Potter and I love how it's not over the top in decorations. It's subtle and only real fans really recognize the references.  The Baristas are very nice and helpful when I asked them questions about the menu and I gotta say my 2 favorite drinks are the butterbrew latte (does not come with espresso so make sure to ask for a shot) and their mango pop (which is like mango soda with ice cream- think root beer float) the food is also amazing I got the avocado toast for breakfast and it was very flavorful and filling.   This has become a staple for me when I visit the Henderson area!",

I've heard about this for a few years, but decided to come once the \"hype\" had gone down to make my own decision, which is- I like this place!   I'm a Harry Potter fan (I was the Harry Potter club advisor at my school last year and my science classroom is Harry Potter themed) and this place is decorated Beautifully! From the tables, decor, platform signs, to the drinks and food!   I definitely recommend an iced lavender white chocolate latte, but I tried the iced Nutella and that was delicious also! (However, I did have to add water to mine because the lavender white chocolate was just a littttlleeee too sweet for my taste). You may want to try their butter beer OF COURSE, but I did not do that. Anddddd the food is actually very well made and tasted delightful!   Don't forget to check in and receive 20% off your iced drink and remember to take photos! Why not take good ones when Harry Potter world in Universal is still 4 hours away! Get your fix here :)",

I'm not a huge Harry Potter fan but still found enjoyment in the theme of the shop, they have little messages on tops of the tables and a little Hedwig in the lounging area. Over all the atmosphere is rustic yet sleek.   Now on to the important part, the coffee! They have a good assortment of different coffee choices that are familiar and some that were unique to me. I asked the barista what was the most popular and he replied with the \"lavender iced white mocha.\" So of course I had to try it.  It ended up only being around $5 and one of the best coffees I have ever had! It was so yummy! I definitely will be going back.",

I was running on two hours of sleep but needed something to keep me up while my boyfriend was down the street at St. Rose. I'm glad I asked how many shots of espresso were in the drinks. Normally there's two in a small and medium and three in the large. Here there are two, three, and FOUR-- make sure you double check if you're used to Starbucks' espresso pours.   I was worried about asking for almond milk as it sometimes ends up tasting gritty but they use quality stuff and it was very smooth. I asked for my beverage half sweetened, and overall was completely impressed.   Not too many tables and while they're cute they've VERY small- it would be hard to do the typical college books all Willy Wonka sprawl. Wish I didn't live so far!!",

I feel like I'm in a cool downtown coffee house in New York...until I go back outside to 109 degree sunny weather. I was at another coffee shop bistro down the way and I ordered an iced tea. $4 later I got an iced water. It was useless. I got my money back and drove till I found something and luckily I didn't even have to leave the parking lot! I caught the sign and came right in for the green pomegranate iced tea and HOLY MOLY is it perfect. It's so damn delicious. I think I just noticed it has a subtle touch of Harry Potter decor. The girl across the room is eating a sandwich and it looks delicious. Damnit, now I have to get something to eat too. The whole place is full of happy hipsters with unique styles and then an older couple in the corner who are adorable, and then me in a bright corral colored hoodie...so I like that everyone and all walks of life come here. All ages, all races, all styles- I'm loving the diversity in here. Did I mention the iced tea I'm drinking is amazing?!",

Of course when I finally decide to go, the Groupon that I have been eyeing forever now is no longer available. Go figure. But that won't stop me from going. Ha.  I got here early around 8am and it was fairly quiet. Maybe two groups of people in here at the time. The decor here is so cute. Love the rustic feel too. So many Harry Potter memorabilia. Very cute.  I ordered the Chestnut Toffee Latte. It came out pretty perfect, no sugar needed. Then when I got my coffee, I saw someone else' food order and I decided to get the same thing. I ordered the Breakfast Waffle. Waffles were very fluffy. My kid loved it with the butter, no syrup needed. A nice surprise was the yogurt, which I didn't know what that little side dish was until I tasted it. It was vanilla yogurt with pineapple jam. Quite tasty. And it reminded me of a pina colada yogurt. Yum! The eggs were done too well for my taste. I wish it was a sunny side up with a little runny yolk. I may have to request this next time.  This place filled up pretty quickly by the time we left. Harry Potter fans must stop in here for sure.   All in all, this is a cute spot. The staff is nice and helpful. Bonus, they offer craft beer and wine too. Who would have thought? I'll be back!",

My boyfriend enjoyed his latte too.   I would've given them 5 stars, but when My boyfriend placed his order and asked for raw sugar with his latte, the cashier said that they have it over there. We really do not like it when people tell us this, as it melts easier when they make the coffee with it.  We never have problems with this request at other coffee locations.   Other than that, the coffee is really good! I'm glad I found another place that makes great Nutella lattes.",

The drinks were not lacking either and everyone inside was very friendly. We can't wait to come back here again and try more magic drinks!",

They have some new items on the menu- must check out!   this time i ordered the lavender and an almond croissant. Both were good except my lavender was not hot enough this time around. The next time ill be sure to request for extra hot! But overall its a nice place and staff are great and friendly!",

The sea salt cream brought out the aromatic of the coffee.  Was the perfect amount of cream to coffee.  I was wired.  Hubby - Got the nitrogen cold brew and was served in a fancy stem glass.  This is meant to enjoy there.  I do wish the selection of pastries is wider than what was available.  Anywho, I would go to Bad Owl any day over DD and SB.",

It was missing a kick to it and in the middle of my meeting I yawned! This place is also pricey my bill came out to $13.06 with the ice coffee and the croissant breakfast sandwich that I ordered. At Starbucks I never paid more than $10 for coffee and a sandwich which was almost ridiculously overpriced. The bad owl had a good idea of adding Harry Potter to it but inside I only seen a book shelf filled with Harry Potter books. I really wished the baristas were wearing some kind of hog warts uniform or the cups would at least have a wand as a straw .   For a Harry Potter fan as huge as I am I guess I didn't see or experienced what I had expected.",

I'm a huge Harry Potter fan. The decor was just okay. I was expecting a little bit more. It would've been awesome if they made it more like a coffee shop that would have been in the world of Harry Potter rather than just the famous symbols painted on the tables and walls. The staff was very friendly though. They had a good variety of drinks, but they only have desserts and pastries as far as food. I got the lavender latte, which was okay, not to strong and not too sweet. My boyfriend got the butter beer latte with a shot of expresso, now his drink was way to sweet for me, but he said he liked it. I would try this place out again only to try their assorted cold brew coffees since I didn't get one on this visit.",

My boyfriend and I didn't mind waiting because we read all the reviews on how great their coffee is and was eager to try it out. I ordered the butter brew latte and my bf ordered a biscoff latte. My bf loved the biscoff latte and my butter brew latte actually tasted like butter beer from the time we went to Universal in Florida. One thing I recommend is that if you're a HUGE coffee junkie like me.. Order the butter brew latte with TWO shots of espresso. I overheard the girl in front of me say that she needed another caffeine booster since her butter brew latte with just one shot of espresso was not strong at all. Overall, it's a great coffee shop when I'm in the area. I'll def be coming back for sure.",

I took a sip of the latte and it was ROOM TEMPERATURE. I don't think I've ever gone to a coffee shop that served a lukewarm drink meant to be hot. If the barista knew it was just sitting there, he should have known better to make a new one. What added to the disappointment was the price. $6+ medium size lukewarm latte.",

Love how the flavors weren't sugary or artificial tasting. Had toasted almond milk latte and an awesome coconut muffin! They were out of few drink flavors, probably need to work on ordering enough stock eventually. They were crazy busy, tables scarce, and everyone is held up at the counter looking at a small paper menu .. That's the thing they REALLY need is a big menu on the wall or above counter! Hopefully that happens, it would speed up people's decisions.",

The atmosphere is exactly what you'd expect from a Harry Potter themed cafe, and it had my fiance who is a huge fan of the series geeking out. Overall amazing experience with a great, friendly staff who make you feel extremely welcome. I'm not from Nevada, but I will definitely always make this a point to stop on my trip.",

The line was always out the door, so we waited a few weeks.  The decor when you walk in is really cool. All Harry Potter stuff. My favorite is the Snape tribute table. My daughter loves the stuffed owl.   My husband and I both ordered the butter beer latte, since everyone and their mom has been raving about these. I opted for no espresso for either of us. YUCK. It tasted like milk with a shot of buttescotch in it. I normally like butterscotch, but not mixed with milk.   The second time I went, I don't even remember what I got. Must not have been memorable.   The decor is cool, the staff is really nice, and the area where they make the drinks is really cool to look at. The drinks are just meh. I'll stick with my chai lattes elsewhere.",

    "text": "I try my best to write non-biased reviews but this is going to be hard. I pretty much think anything with Harry Potter is AWESOME!!  I visited here with my boyfriend yesterday, 3/13/16, around noon. The line, as expected, was out the door. The tables were also packed. The wait to place an order took a long time, around 15-20 min. It didn't seem so bad though since we made friends in line who ended up buying our drinks. I guess HP fans are just cool like that :)  Once we placed our orders, which were one hot butter brew and once iced butter brew (both with espresso), we only had to wait a few minutes for our drinks to be ready. The iced butter brew was mine. It had good flavor but I thought it was too sweet and only drank a few sips of it. However, I'm one of those people that dislikes the butterbeer served at the Wizarding World of HP at Universal Studios so don't let this review deter you from trying the butter brew if A. you're a Harry Potter fan and/or B. you like sweets. I will suggest getting it hot though because it was REALLY good like that! Like really good. I kept stealing sips from my boyfriend's cup.  The decor was cool and of course I'm a fangirl so I really appreciated it. I would really love it if this place were bigger though. You really can't enjoy the space because it's too small and currently too popular.  You've got to try this place out if you're a Harry Potter fan or even if you're not, just for the delicious hot butter brew. I give Bad Owl four stars for this yummy drink, the novelty of the theme, and the friendly staff. It's far from me so I don't see myself going back unless I'm in the area. I'll travel far for food, but no so much for coffee, even if Harry Potter is involved. If I am in the area, however, I'd stop in to try something else on their extensive and interesting menu.",

The decor is just HP enough to get fans what they want but without being super overt and feeling cheesy. Also, the \"coffeehouse music\" is strong here, with mellow Coldplay, Kings of Leon, and acoustic covers of 80's love songs....  Otherwise, this is just like any other coffee place. Will say they have a good hot tea selection and if I had been staying to study I would have made use of that. Their iced tea was only OK and while they have some pastries, food options are limited.   Overall, this is a 3.5 star but I'll bump it up for the ambiance. Service was friendly :)",

    "text": "As a David Lynch/Twin Peaks devotee, I came across this cafe only to find out it varied from a distinctive literary reference: Harry Potter. A book series that I find way too simple to read, which is not necessarily a bad aspect. Though, I would much rather use up that time to stimulate my mind with imploring in the works of founding figures of existentialism, medieval discourse on nature, what have you.  Alas, I digress, I had an okay sensory experience when ingesting my cappuccino. However, it was not anything too impressive in comparison to the ones I have had in Wicker Park, Chicago. The soy was nicely steamed, which resulted in a full, rich structure. Further, it gave the proper sweetness, instead of a simple flat taste as regular soy would.  An exposed brick wall, zany light fixtures, steel pipes, and Harry Potter-inspired decor throughout gave Bad Owl a funky and trendy atmosphere. Perhaps, I am only saying that because I have always been fond of the rustic industrial appeal. The employees were all lovable. I complimented their cafe's music compilation and it turns out that it was a personal soundtrack constructed by one of the staff members. I find indie rock cringeworthy and a tad trite now, but sipping coffee whilst jamming to Radiohead brings back memories to my youth years - when 'indie' had not fully lost its genuine meaning.  I cannot give this a proper review because I have not tried that many nourishments/beverages the menu has to offer. Overall, for the time being, I had a great experience and I find myself returning!  'til then, evanesco!  -1 star for not playing (Sandy) Alex G.",

However once we got to this place, the only real complaint I had is that there is always a line! The atmosphere was relaxed and nice.  There are a few harry potter themed beverages as well as signs around but honestly it's not crazy ovet doing it on the harry potter motif. I had a delicious lavender latte here, multiple times now, as well as a mint mojito latte iced. I know it sounds weird but the espresso followed by a refreshing mint flavor was actually very good. Be prepared for sticker shock, pastries start at 5 bucks and go up from there. They didn't look awesome enough for me to waste  that kind of money!    The inside is very nicely decorated and spacious, but don't expect a table if you go during busy times. You may have to wait for one. The staff here is very friendly and knowledgeable from my experience,  I have noticed other people saying they are not so smart or opinionated,  but i thought they were fine.   Overall I will definitely be back to try more options from this place and was glad we had stopped by in the first place.  Excellent brew, good selections and good atmosphere.",

    "text": "So this place has a few kinks. Of course, this place opened not even 2 weeks ago. We went on a Saturday, so I anticipated a long wait but I was so excited, I stalked Yelp, their Facebook and Instagram to be informed of any changes in their business hours, etc.  We arrived at 8:06am, approximately 6 minutes after they opened. On our drive there, I discovered from their Instagram that they were out of the supplies to be able to make their Butter Brew specialty. Que disappointment, but was still eager to try other things on the menu anyway. Previously had their Biscoff (cookie butter) latte, and it was AMAZING.   There was a sign on the door that read 'Out of Butter Brew', so they do a good job at communicating. We walked in and the line was so long, it took us a few minutes to figure out where the line ended so that we could stand there without being in the way of the patrons at the tables. I asked a group of beauty school looking peeps if they were the end of the line and they kinda shrug-answered me. Guess they REALLLY needed their coffee to activate their personalities. Anyway, discovered that they were at the back of the line so we took our place in the back.   There is a clip board that the menu is attached to. Pretty cool for those at the end of the line who would otherwise not be able to see an actual menu.   The Harry Potter theme is strong. While waited in line, we saw person after person pose with the white owl perched in its cage at Platform 9 3/4. Some were even sporting their mustard and maroon Harry scarves.   The wait turned out to be pretty long. Like, 40 minutes long. We chose a huge butter croissant, a chocolate chip muffin, a blended Macha and two white chocolate mochas, blended. They were pretty tasty. I gobbled up my croissant while waiting for my drink. Sorry 'bout the crumbs. For 2 pastries and 3 blended drinks (and with a nice tip), our bill was $26. Pretty on par with 'specialty' coffee places.   The two identical white chocolate mochas were different in color (one was almost pure white like vanilla bean, the other had the coffee color and taste). Of course, the line was too scary to try to jump back in, and the workers were so frazzled because they were so busy, we decided it wasn't that big of an issue.   Cool atmosphere, customer service was just 'OK'. The cashier was probably too stressed to crack a smile. The concept, theme and the product is brilliant, though. Side note: Umpqua oats oatmeal is sold here, and it looks like they are a local company- I'm all about supporting local business.   Tip: If waiting in a massive line here, get the 'MSQRD' app and take a selfie using the Harry Potter filter. Align it with Platform 9 3/4 and white owl. *mind blown*",

We ordered the Breakfast Croissant, Wizard Meltdown, Chicken Caesar Wrap, the B.O.C, Butterbrew with added espresso shot (iced), House Ice Tea, and an iced coffee.    The sandwiches were pretty good with a good ratio of meat, cheese, etc. The exception was the Caesar wrap which didn't have much chicken and wasn't especially impressive.  The Butterbrew wasn't overly sweet (in my opinion) despite what I had read here on Yelp!, but was pretty good.  I forgot to ask if they have lactose-intolerant options :(   Next time I'd like to try the other specialty drinks because my friends didn't order anything too crazy... Anyone could suck down a mediocre tea or iced coffee.  The theme (Harry Potter with a random Dr. Who item in the front corner) is pretty cool with some hilarious deviations (Platform 9 6/8) to avoid copyright issues (probably).  Overall nice atmosphere and they have a neat bench area for people using laptops/ hanging out to work.  We received a discount on our iced drinks for checking in on Yelp! but our food/drinks totaled $57.82.  A little pricey if you ask me!",

It is a small venue nestled in a strip of businesses. As we walked through a wall of nicotine that is outside the control of the business, we entered into another world. The decoration is on par with the theme. We didn't make it far inside as there was a long line. We were passed a clipboard with a menu to help expedite the process. The regular coffee options were available with some teas and small food acutramants. The drink that jumped out at me was the butter brew latte. My mind was made up.   We waited in line for 15 minutes and waited an additional 8 for our coffee. The staff Is friendly and nice and eager to answer any question you have. Once your order is placed there is no sense of urgency to crank out the joyous nectar the make. Our drinks were made and handed out. My butter brew latte was exactly as I imagined. It was good as I sipped it and looked for a place to sit and take in the experience. There was nothing available so we left.   The coffee was good and worth a try if you're in the area. As we left the line was out the door. As I checked in I observed other yeplers shared a long wait time in line. Hopefully they will get quicker as time goes on. I will revisit the establishment in a month and hopefully I can give it more than 3 stars.",

With it being so new it is very popular so be prepared to wait in line for around 20 minutes. I went at 1pm usually a not busy time and it was crowded.   I wanted to buy a gift card for my coworker since it was her birthday coming up and she loves Harry Potter. Sadly they do not yet have those available. Hopefully one day they will since they are missing out on those sales.  I ordered the Butter Brew Latte which is a butter beer inspired drink. It is a top seller since everyone wants to order something Harry Potter themed. It is made with butterscotch and a secret ingredient. It was pretty good. They also have a nutella latte that would I like to try at a later date. It is on the more expensive side but then again any speciality coffee shop is.   It's very hispter coffee shop and lots of cool Harry Potter references. A must see for any fan.",

I didn't have to wait in line too long-- with a couple in front of me.. but after me a 10 min line had built up.  The butter brew latte with espresso tastes like any other flavored latte with a butterscotch aftertaste. It's delicious but not what I was expecting in terms of a super Harry Pottered drink. I think I'll make it a point to not get the espresso shot next time just to give it another shot.  The place is definitely a cool spot to hang out if you have plenty of time to kill. I'll definitely be back.. likely mid week to avoid crowds.. to try their Nitrogen Cold Brew, one of their specialty lattes, or espresso.   P.s. I've heard lines are hit or miss. On the weekends the wait could be up to 40-something minutes. For someone whose an avid Harry Potter fan and keen on the Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal... I think you might be disappointed if you're only coming here for that theme. Aside from a bunch of signs.. it looks like a normal hipster coffee shop.",

They have a great check in offer: 20% off an iced drink. After the Las Vegas heat that I had endured all weekend, an iced drink was very welcome. I ordered the Lychee Cream Pop (a new menu item), which is like an Italian cream soda with pureed lychees. It was good, but the cup wasn't filled up all the way. There was about an inch of room at the top. It was not enough drink for $4.40.  I also ordered the Wizard Meltdown sandwich (another new menu item) with the mixed greens. The sandwich is a cheddar, mozzarella, and parmesan grilled cheese with tomato and guacamole. It was also good, but not very hot. There was still cheese that hadn't melted, so they happily heated it more for me. The mixed greens were fresh and crisp, and included plenty of arugula, which I love. It only comes with balsamic dressing, which was very good, but I was craving ranch. Overall, I don't know if it was worth the $9.25.  All of the employees were friendly. They happily discussed what traffic I might hit on my way home and wished me safe travels.",

It is definitely for dark coffee lovers with no sweeteners or cream/milk. 5 stars for service, cleanliness of facility, and tastings of beverages. I expect I will become a regular.

    "text": "On vacation visiting Las Vegas last week. We are huge Harry Potter fans so I was very excited to hear about this place and of course I wanted to try the butter beer latte. Awesome decor, busy with lots of people, so I had high hopes. During the wait in line I overheard a customer mention the butter beer latte had no caffeine. This is not posted anywhere. When it was my turn I asked the young lady at the counter if the butter beer came with espresso. She replied all lattes were \"with or without.\" Confused I asked again if she meant the drink came with espresso. The server rolled her eyes and replied, \"yeah if you want it.\" I asked if this cost extra and she once again rolled her eyes and said, \"it costs like 50 cents.\" I looked at the menu board and realized it was $1.00 per shot which would bump the price up by $2.00 for me - most 20 ounce lattes I've had come with 2 shots and I like caffeine. I wanted to clarify before I paid over $9 for a drink so I asked if was $1.00 per shot or if it was reduced to $.50. The server said nothing just glared at me and rolled her eyes a third time! She never answered my question. I was really embarrassed by the whole incident and knowing the place was busy I quickly ordered a small drip coffee to go. Really taken aback by the hostile attitude!   I understand the butter beer may be a premium drink and cost more - no problem there. It's great the kids (and non caffeinated adults) have something fun to order. But in all my years of drinking coffee I've never heard of a latte without espresso so I don't think I was out of line asking that question. And I don't know why the server was so angry and snotty! The butter beer without espresso is a milk steamer not a latte. More importantly, the nasty attitude ruined the whole thing for me. I had planned to buy a Bad Owl tank top and get my son a hot chocolate. That's easily a $30 plus order gone, as well as any future service from me as we visit the area multiple times per year. This is the first negative review I've ever written on Yelp and I'm sad it is for a coffee shop with such a great premise.",

We waited too long for help, I didn't see butter beer listed on the menu so I asked the employee if they did serve it. He said he wasn't sure but he could make something up. I was confused but happy to give it a shot. $4 per drink later, not a clean table anywhere, and a half an hour wait when my kids were brought cups of milk with ICE and butterscotch syrup. We did go in August, but come on, ICE in Milk with syrup?!?!?! Totally not even close to butter beer. If you are going to market yourself towards a Harry Potter crowd there had better be some training with employees and at least a normal attempt at a butterbeer.",
