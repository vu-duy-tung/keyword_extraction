    "text": "Leaving Las Vegas, but I'll never forget Honey Pig!  I have been to honey pig 6 times in the last 2 years, and have always loved every single thing I have tried there. It was my first experience with korean food of any sort, and will compare this restaurant to all others for the rest of my life. I have brought a number of out-of-towner's and local friends to this restaurant and have always had extremely positive feedback from all but one person (whose pretty surly so so I'll just say it's a character default!).   In previous reviews, some people have complained about service if they are not Korean, but I have never had too many issues. The small issues that have arisen in the past seem to be getting non-existent each time I visit so hopefully they've worked out the glitches.   Most recently I brought my out-of-town guests to the restaurant and we ordered the AYCE lunch which was great, but was soooo much meat that we weren't able to rally for the AMAZING fried rice that you usually get at the end of one of the combo meals. I plan on going one last time before I leave this town and ordering just pork belly and fried rice for one last delicious and memorable meal. :)",

We did the $20 AYCE of course and it did not disappoint. We didn't do anything too crazy... just the bulgogi, pork belly, short rib, chicken and octopus. Personally I think there just were not enough banchan and our waitress did not refill our bean sprouts even once.   Also, I've been to the Honey Pig in LA and they serve the sweet rice at the end which I enjoyed quite a bit. Vegas Honey Pig didn't do that. Not sure if they generally don't or just forgot with us. My husband enjoyed Honey Pig and we will definitely go back again soon but not without taking him to the LA location first.  Mmmmm piggies...",

The server touched the tip of the spoons and chopsticks with her hands and handed them to us, which was completely unsanitary since she just picked up the bill at the other table.

    "text": "First thing I noticed about Honey Pig was the aquarium (probably because it's right in front of you.  It was pretty busy for a Thursday night.  The crowd was a bit older and it seemed nearly everyone dining was some sort of Asian.  The atmosphere was inviting.  Tables were pretty near from one another, but you still have plenty of elbow room.  It was pretty loud in there and I could barely hear anyone at my table.  I thought my hearing was just going bad, but 2 other members of my party had a hard time hearing me when I was talking (yay, I'm not going deaf).     The service was mediocre.  There were moments where I found myself searching for a server to change our unique, circular grill top (which is also used as decor throughout the restaurant) and to refill my water and Barley Tea.  The service could definitely be better (in my opinion).   The food itself wasn't bad.  We had the AYCE dinner ($19.99).  The lunch AYCE is priced at $14.99 pp.  I don't usually care for pork belly, but Honey Pig's pork belly wasn't too bad.  Pros:  *  clean atmosphere  *  good food (I fancied the Squid most)  *  decently priced  *  they cut your meats for you... that's nice =)  Cons:  * slow service  * bland salad  * restricted to one order of Sirloin per person  Tips:  * order two meats at a time, otherwise you'll be left looking for service  * they won't refill your side dishes if you don't ask",

I've tried different Korean bbq places in Vegas and some of them are good but not as good as Honey Pig. There are 2 big differences between Honey Pig and other places;   1. The meat is marinated better. Soooo yummy! 2. The grill is bigger so you can cook more food.   The only downside is that they don't have All You Can Eat for dinner and sometimes don't offer All You Can Eat for lunch so be sure to call ahead and ask.",

This place holds its own, and the wait staff was slightly better than other BBQ's (i'm looking at you SSGS)  i've been to.  The side dishes were minimal, as we got fish, potatoes and radishes.  I guess not every place can be like SSGS and empty out the fridge and serve 40 side dishes.  We ordered Honey Pig Combo #2 and an order of kalbi.  The bacon, prime beef and kalbi were all great.  But what surprised me was how good the vegetables were...the onion and the bean sprouts were awesome.  Piping hot bean sprouts was my favorite.  And i'm not gonna lie, i dipped it in the fat and leftover kalbi grease. mmmmm  Shots of sake were sprinkled throughout the night, so this review my be spiked with some cold sake.  What can i say, sake makes me biased.  I was disappointed we never got soup, but overall the place was solid.  Not the best i've had, but above average for sure.",

We ordered their number 1B which included Brisket. Bulgogi Fried Rice. We ordered extra Bulgogi and Spicy Chicken. Sides came with Ban Cho (sauteed bean sprouts), Kimchi that were placed in heated pan - which have always been my fav side dishes. I've never had them warmed before but they were delicious. It came with other side dishes as well - pickled cucumber which another fav of mine, tofu and Daikon which is another side that my boyfriend loves. I love that they had 3 sauces for us to dip our meats with - my fav was the Korean paste. The whole experience reminded me of when my Korean girlfriend would take me to restaurants in LA. We were so stuffed but couldn't stop eating. We ate everything we ordered. It was that good!!! Thank you!!!",

    "text": "Experience: Was invited to come with a huge group of folks...about 20 of us. I love Korean BBQ, so I won't ever pass up an invite.   Facility:  it seemed very tight. The tables are packed in. But they have 2 sides and enough room for our group of 20 (divided amongst 2 tables).  They had tables and chairs and even some bench seating. The neat part of this place is the actual BBQ is like a lid versus a grill. Which is perfect for their ending of rice.   Service:  When we first came in we sat a while until someone brought us water, so we helped ourselves. I then had to ask for things repeatedly, such as water, napkins, jalapenos, etc.  I think they need to schedule more staff when they know they have large parties scheduled.   Food:  the banchan was not good to me.  It was all very sweet and they only had 4 dishes. I'm used to many choices and so much eaten that they have to bring seconds and thirds. Not one dish was emptied, so I wasn't the only person disappointed with the flavors.  I do like that they start the grill out with some kimchi and bean sprouts. I didn't really eat these, because I wanted to save my room for the meat.  The meat was very good.  We started with the non-marinated flavors such as the brisket, which was cut very thin, and it was good. Then we moved to pork belly, which was so good!!  Next was Kalbi, but you only get one serving of it, even though it's AYCE. the last thing I tried was the bulgogi.  I really enjoyed all of the meats.  I wish I wasn't too full to try the chicken, the sirloin and the squid that my friends all ate.   I love that they serve the lettuce leaves to wrap the meat in and they brought out nice and spicy paste (not mixed with beans) for me when requested.  I love that on my wrap!  Overall:  I like it, but won't be my go to for Korean BBQ. If someone else is going, I would tag along, because the meat was good.  I just prefer more choices in banchan and good choices...not so much sweet stuff.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were in Vegas for a few days craving some good korean barbecue, and we came to this place after having a good experience at a Honey Pig back in Virginia. We got the All You Can Eat lunch, and we both thought it was great! You have an hour to eat anything off the AYCE menu - we ordered brisket, beef tenderloin, spicy pork, and spicy chicken ribs (boneless). There was a limited variety of banchan, but for lunch it was understandable. However, the bean sprouts did not taste too fresh. The meat was excellent - I highly recommend the spicy meats, as they are more flavorful. The brisket was nice and lean, and the tenderloin was very thick and filling. I enjoyed the spicy pork the most. The service was great. However, I am giving 4 stars because they charge you for any leftovers you have, so you need to make sure you can eat everything you order. We requested half portion of one of our meats so we could make sure we would finish and not get overcharged. If you've been to the Honey Pig in Virginia/Maryland - same atmosphere, but the food is slightly different. I would say the Honey Pig in Virginia has slightly fresher veggies, but it might just have been that day. Overall, great choice! Would go back again!",

    "text": "tl;dr: food is okay, but they cut you off. service is beyond awful. BEYOND awful. i can't stress that enough.  been here twice. the first time was a mediocre experience, but nothing bad enough to write about.  the second time i went was an absolutely awful experience - so bad that we left after ordering our food and realizing that customer service as horrendous as the first ten minutes were for the whole night would be entirely unacceptable.  first things first, i have to point out that i'm just a teenager. a baby-faced, 18-year-old teenager who often gets mistaken for 14, so i expect service to be less than stellar for the majority of places i go. however, this place set the bar at a new low.  we (was with two friends - a group of 3) came into the place at 11:45 - maybe a bit late to expect good service, but i'll get around to that later. we were seated fairly quickly and handed menus. after a bit of deliberation, we signalled that we were ready order, once to get the server's attention, again to remind her that we were ready to order, and a third time to finally get her to break away from her EXTREMELY busy task of wiping down tables. all of this took about 10 minutes, mind you, and the place was almost empty - other than us, there was a single party of 2.  so the server comes over, and asks us what we'd like to order, and while we confirm with each other really quickly that we'd like one of the combo meals, she turns to them, and seats them. this struck me as unusual, but i let it slide. but after she seated them, instead of letting the other server do it who was also unoccupied, she left our table to get them menus, barley tea, and drinks. and didn't come back to our table. at all. i had to flag down another waitress and tell her explicitly that we were ready to order.  she took our order, and asked for our drink choices. i saw that they had tons of pitchers of barley tea sitting on a table near us, and asked for that. she had the audacity to tell me that they were out! the table next to us (that came in while we were ordering) were served a pitcher of barley tea WITHOUT even asking for it! at this point, i decided enough was enough. i cancelled our order and left. went to tofu hut. waited an hour, but the wait was way more worth it than the terrible nightmare that service was here.  and the first time? we got ayce kbbq. the servers cut us off (a party of 6) after 10 dishes and 45 minutes there - at a time where they weren't even especially busy. the food is decent, but the service is beyond terrible. i wouldn't recommend this place.  if you're in the plaza, go to pho so 1. i'm not especially fond of their pho, but the servers and food there is a lot better than at honey pig.",

Asked waitress for recommendations on what to eat. If there was something that makes them stand out above the rest she didn't recommend or serve it to us. Don't think you need to go out of your way for this location. But you probably won't be disappointed either. They offered macaroon ice cream which sounded good but we didn't try it.",

    "text": "This place is so good. It is a bit pricey, but it is well worth it. We came in on a Friday night and ordered the combo of pork belly, brisket, tri tip and an ala carte order of squid. The pork belly was thick and juicy, pork neck, which became my favorite since it was so tender, the brisket was not dry or bland at all and the squid was tender and made my mouth water. I loved the fact that the servers cooked the food. On this night there were an ample amount of servers and the customer service was excellent! The combo included fried rice, but we opted for regular steamed rice.  It was just 4 of us and the food was too much! The good thing about the combo order versus AYCE, is that you can take home the food.  The banchan was fresh and tasty we had pickled daikon, marinated potato, kim chi, marinated/pickled bean sprouts, chili cucumber and there were 3 food for the sauces from the get go. The marinade was not spicy as it appeared and it was just enough flavor and saltiness for the meat. You can tell the quality of the meat was fantastic compared to a lot of the AYCE places around Vegas.  My son had the rice cake and dumpling soup. It was piping hot and  delicious. The rice cakes were chewy and filling, the dumplings were pork and green onion, and they were huge! Ultimately, this is one of the top KBBQ Places in Vegas in my opinion.",

Located just 5 mins from the Las Vegas Strip; it's definitely worth the cab ride.    Come prepared with an appetite and ready to DRINK!  This is a Korean BBQ place, no frills, nothing fancy, but damn good food, and shots of Soo Ju (a Korean Rice Wine served cold).    The server will bring out little side dishes that we call, \"Ban Chon\" (sauteed bean sprouts, spinach and the Korean staple, Kim Chi).  You can choose the different meats that you want to grill at your table.  I would recommend a marinated beef, an un-marinated beef, pork belly.  The food here is soooooo good.  It's probably the best Korean food in Vegas.     They offer a lot of different food and drinks that you wouldn't find at other traditional Korean restaurants, so feel free to ask your server for suggestions.  And in True Vegas style, they have an all you can eat lunch special for $12.95 and dinner special for $19.99  Here's a little Korean saying that we have to make you feel right at home.  You'll need to pour a drink for everyone at the table except your own.  It is a Korean custom that you never pour your own drink.    Then raise you glass and scream, \"Kum bae!\"  and everyone will cheers you and take shots.  Repeat several times and then go karaoke.    Congratulations, you've been \"Honey Pig\"d.",

    "text": "Came here around 9pm on a sat night with some friends from out of town. Waited 5min to be acknowlegde (I'm on crutches, how can they not notice a handicap patron in front of a group next to the aquarium in an open space dining room? I don't buy it.) just to be seated at a table that has been set up for 2 that seems to be used: menus, pitcher of barley tea, 2 half empty cup, and chopsticks and spoons that were out of placed like not set on the napkins.  To my surprised, the lady only cleared the bori cha (tea), and reset the same utensil on the napkins.    I'm sure i'm not the only one, but that's pretty freakin' gross.  I have no idea who these people were before me, and i'm sure as hell not going to reused their same set up even if they haven't obviously been tampered with.  That's just plain disgusting and against health code violation.  I was so horrified that I walked out.  I can't think of a time i've been more upset and actually walked out of a restaurant before.  And it's not like i've never been here before, in fact I'm a regular here during afterhours and do get pretty special treatment from my noona(older sis), the graveyard server.  I will not be coming back to honey pig during dinner time. Shame on you lady..",

    "text": "Sigh...I so wanted to like Honey Pig...maybe I just need to come back and do their all you can eat.  We were here Easter Sunday, about 3pm, there was only two other tables in there.  I had a pretty big party- 4 adults & 8 kids, since their tables are kinda small, we had to split up and take two tables.  We were there early but were told they don't offer the lunch AYCE price ($14.95) on the weekends, they only offer the dinner AYCE prices ( $19.95).  Well, with 8 kids ranging from 14 to 4yrs old, it was not worth the $20 bucks a person since it was a first time for Korean food for most of the kids and we didn't know if they would like it. So, we opted for the $99 combo which came with almost all the meats available.  All the meats were good but because we split the combo for both tables, we got some things the kids didn't and they got things we didn't.  Overall, the pork belly and bulgolgi was great, the steak was melt in your mouth good, and everything else was just okay.  The salad, I've had better at Mother's and the banchan was a disappointment.  We really only got two banchans and the kim chee was put on the grill...hmm okay..  The poor waitress was the only one working and she actually helps you grill but since she was the only one, she had to bounce around quite a bit since there was now more tables in the place.  Since we had the kids at their own table, they ordered rice and drinks, while the adults waited and wondered if we were going to get rice..only to have the waitress make us fried rice at the end...hmm, I kinda wanted rice with my meat??  Anyhow, our combo came with a soup that was just okay...usually I like my kimchee jigae.  I also asked for a japchae that never came so I don't even know if we were charged for it.  I know we were charged for ALL the kids rices!!  Overall, it was still a bargain to feed all of us for about $120, but I think I'm going to have to continue my search for that place that serves up 30 banchans!!  Okay I can dream can't I??",

    "text": "I am Korean and have been to several of the Honey Pigs around California. Needless to say I really enjoy the food and atmosphere of this unique dining experience.    I was in Las Vegas for a conference and knew that there was a Honey Pig in town. I invited my guests from Korea as well as my caucasian customers locally.  As soon as I entered, I noticed something was very different to the other HP's I've been to.  I wanted to impress and ordered the top quality beef to start. As soon as it came out on the plate, I noticed that it looked different. Like it was still semi frozen. We started to eat and knew right away that the meat quality was sub par.  After only eating half the order, I thought we would switch gears and order the famous pork that is what draws people to Honey Pig.   I need to save a little 'face' with my guests and went with what made Honey Pig famous.......the pork belly.   Regardless of restaurant, the meat quality is bad here.  I asked the waitress if the owners were the same as the original owners from LA. They told me it wasn't, that they just paid for the name. No wonder, food quality is definitely not the Honey Pig that I know.  For Korean BBQ, I have been to better in Las Vegas.  Lesson learned.   If your in Las Vegas and looking for Korean BBQ, don't get fooled with this knock off!",

So our food came and my table consist on 2 kids and 3 adults. The portion of the meat at my table compared to the other table of 4 was tremendously smaller. Not only this but the service was really slow and I don't even know why it takes so long to take out raw meat. Another thing that pissed me off is when I was cooking the meat on the grill and everything was already set in place the employee came and TRIED COOKING For us but FAILED. When she left the meat was not set on the grill correctly so we had to wait even longer to eat our food. And lastly stop deciding whether or not you can give us less portions than other tables cuz the kids stopped eating and turning off the fire when we still have food still cooking.",

I believe some of the premium meats (i.e. Kalbi) has a limit of one per person, but the quality here is always great.  Service is solid.  Quality of food is great.  Sometimes they change their deal (i.e. If there is a convention in town they don't offer all-you-can-eat option).  I'm not a big fan of the plaza.  It's dirty and the people there are questionable (next door is a Big Lots).  Anyways we 're fans of Honey Pig for Korean food,",

    "text": "My two stars come from the food quality. I like the food. HOWEVER...  Their service SUCKS! We came here expecting a nice lunch after attending my bff's daughters dance recital. When we walked in there was no one in the place, cool. I had to  use to restroom before we were even sat so I quickly ran off to the restroom, when I entered I almost busted my ass from slipping on the large puddle of random water sitting in the middle of the floor (no the toilet or sink wasnt leaking nor was there a mop bucket in there). Despite the puddle of water on the floor the restroom was clean. The over all cleanliness of the facility was clean.   It was a Saturday afternoon (during lunch time hours according to their menu instructions) and we chose to get the AYCE for lunch. The waitress notified us that during the weekends they only observe the AYCE dinner pricing, AYCE lunch pricing was for during the week only. Okay, fine. Next she asked how old the child with us was, we told her she was 7, so she said that the child would only be half price. Cool! BONUS! Why a bonus? Because this child eats like an adult.   Our initial food came out quickly. YUM! So being that there was a total of 4 bodies at the table, hungry bodies at that, you would think that we would be monitored by our waitress or wait staff to see when we were out of meat and veggies, but no we weren't. If we got more food it was because we had to flagg them down. Then when they would bring it out it would sit on the table holding the warm tee crap that was across from us. When it finally arrived at the table they would throw it on and turn the heat down. WTF? WE ARE HUNGRY! Why would you turn the heat down? It was cooking to slow. So every time I would make my cousin turn the heat up some staff member would come by and turn it down. WTF? Is this the way that they keep you there longer but not serve you AYCE because theres a time limit? I also had to ask twice for a drink. I was willing to let all this shitty service fly right over my head because the food was good, and never mind it until the bill arrived....  1. We were told that the child would be half price. They charged us full price. I took my bill up to the front counter and notified the kid up there it was wrong and what it should be. After fumbling with the calculator trying to prove they had charged me 3 full price and 1 half price, he finally realized I was right and then proceeded to blame the cash register being incorrect because they just installed a new system. Whatever. I was able to figure out our total bill including tax on my phone before he was able to fix it in the system.  2. After he fixed the bill and handed it back to me I noticed that the sales tax rate was at 8.15% which I am pretty sure that the current tax rate in Clark County, Nevada is at 8.10%. After seeing this I decided that they could use the extra few cents they got from me on charging the wrong tax, as their tip. I didn't even bother asking him to fix this.  Ya know I am a good tipper, a really good tipper when I get excellent service especially. I know what its like to be a household that relies on income that is generated from tips. And this place just flat out pisses me off (like you couldn't already tell).  I will never return to this place. Dry the bathroom floor, fix your cash register, correct your tax rate and pay better attention to your customers! Get your shit together Honey Pig before another Korean BBQ spot turns turns you into BACON!",

I'm not sure if they normally do that to their customers, or that they were just really slow and they needed something to do? But overall this is what I would rate this restaurant:   4/5 for the food. The beef brisket, beef tenderloin, and boneless rib were my favorite off of the all you can eat special. I also tried their peach soju, which was amazing.    5/5 for the service. They were fast with our orders, constantly checked up on us, and were super friendly.   The food there however is a little bit on the pricier side, so if you're looking to eat a lot and get your money's worth, then I suggest you check this place out!",

There was not that many people in the restaurant eating though!   The quality of the meats and the bean sprouts were not to my liking. The sprouts especially had an odd flavor to them. I felt like there was a lack of flavor in a lot of areas! If you are choosing to eat here, I would recommend the pork belly and brisket. Those were the best tasting meats on the menu.   The two things I did like was the pickled radish and the way they flavor their \"water\" with a weak tea, which I found very refreshing! Also, their grill is a very unique, round inverted-bowl shape, which allows for cleaner grilling practices.   To be honest, I've just had better and for a cheaper price.",

I walked in and the place was empty. Just two waitresses and they looked at me like I was crazy when I said it was only a party of one. My waitress sat me and gave me a menu but didn't ask me if I wanted anything to drink. When she took my order, she still didn't ask me if I wanted anything to drink.   My food came out and she still didn't ask me if I wanted anything. I had to finally ask her. After that I never saw her again, until it was time for me to pay. So I think I can also confirm that the service here is spotty. Maybe they just don't care to be nice.   However, my food made up for the experience. It was about $12 before tax and tip. I ordered a lunch plate with meat and noodles and it was good. I really did enjoy my lunch. I left satisfied and full but with the crappy service, I just don't know if I would return.",

    "text": "TIP: If you want to avoid the wait, come early for lunch. We came maybe a couple hours after it opened for lunch on a Saturday and it was almost an empty house.  Just like the Los Angeles location, you are relegated to a circular grill with rock-solid seats. Make sure you take advantage of those seat cushions or you'll be sure to have a sore butt after!   The concept is simple. Order your meats and the ajumma will throw them all on the grill along with a bowl of kimchi and spiced bean sprouts. We mainly stuck with the brisket. Probably not the best quality as it had more fat on them than I'd prefer. Their brisket is sliced so thin that you won't run into the issue of having overly dry, rough meat to chew on. Once you're done with your meat, all the kimchi and spiced bean sprouts are mixed with rice to make kimchi fried rice.   Naengmyun -- I ended up ordering cold noodles because I needed something that wasn't heavily greased and hot. I'm very picky about my buckwheat noodles in terms of texture. They had some pretty decent naengmyun, with noodles prepared al dente. The hot sauce wasn't overly spicy so even the kids could enjoy it. The noodles are topped with sliced cucumbers, pear, and meat. You get half of a chilled hard-boiled egg and everything is topped with sesame seeds. Great flavors, perfectly spiced, and good noodle texture.  They have a nifty coffee machine by the door. Great ending to an ultra greasy meal.",

Most of the side dishes weren't looking to appealing, taste and appearance both were a little disappointing.

Many of the top Asian-American elitists who are members of our organization meet together once a month. 99% of the the time we meet at either Sushi on Rainbow or HONEY PIG. It's just become our spot to discuss business. Also, we consider the honorable Mr. Jake Lee to be quite a respected figure in the LV Asian-American community, so we eat here to show our respects to him. Mr. Lee is so respected that even the Japanese members of our agency see him as a great role model for their community.  I'm a Yakiniku guy. But, HONEY PIG is the only Korean BBQ that I would prefer over Yakiniku(for those of you who do not know, Yakiniku is the Japanese variation of Korean BBQ). Yakiniku restaurants are known for using very high quality meats, but the beef at HONEY PIG is much more tender and higher in quality than even the most expensive Yakiniku joints in San Diego or LA.  There are lots of really good choices here in LV for AYCE Korean BBQ, but they just can't compare to HONEY PIG. Sura is also a great choice, but it can't touch THE PIG.  Don't get me wrong, I love Sura and the service is really good but HONEY PIG just has much more superior quality meats and it's  always perfectly marinaded. I hate how at the other Korean BBQ joints in town, they rush the preparations and the meat does not have that full flavor of the marinade. You won't get that problem here at THE PIG.     Just to let you yelpers know, you can't satisfy Korean customers. You can bring your Korean friends to the best Korean restaurant in the world and they will still give it 1-star.  Korean's always compare restaurants to their mother's cooking and if it doesn't taste like Mom's kalbi then it officially \"sucks\" to them. So if you are Korean, then maybe don't come here. If you are Japanese, Filipino, Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, etc then come on over.    Some yelpers are claiming that the staff won't treat you well unless you are Korean. That's just not True. Most of us are very visibly Japanese, and we get VIP treatment.  I don't know, maybe they just treat us good because we spend so much money.  I mean, if you are Asian-American and your household doesn't have investments and assets worth at least over 1.5 million, you probably should be pretty embarrassed to call yourself Asian.  Mr. Lee does a very good job with his restaurants. I see some people wondering if the HONEY PIG in Los Angeles is related to this location, and the answer is that his brother owns that one.   All I can say is that I got nothing but respect for Mr. Lee and his HONEY PIG. What a great restaurant to have here in LV.",

I usually require at least 2 meals at a place before I'll write a review, however they impressed me so much I'm writing it after one visit (I have a feeling there will be many more).  We arrived at the Honey Pig at 10:15, I asked about the AYCE menu she informed us it stopped at 10, but went to the main counter, asked the manager, and brought us the menu.  The AYCE is runs lunch from 11a-3p and dinner runs from 5-10p. There were a few language barriers, as we were the only non-asians in the place. Our server was friendly and ensured we never ran out of food.  The menu included about 6 meats, and some sides. The Broccoli and salad were pretty good, and the soup was a nice touch on a cold evening. The meats however were the highlight of the night. We started with some beef, then moved on to pork belly, then the spicy chicken, followed by the marinated sirloin, a helping of bulgogi, and the meal was topped off with the Short Ribs.  All of the meats were great, the pork belly, Sirloin, Short Ribs, and Bulgogi, were the highlights for me. The grills were a little small and we really only had one meat cooking at a time, but there was enough to keep us happy while the next meat cooked.  I have been to a few KBBQ places before, but this was the first time we had a dedicated server who was cooking the meal (most I've gone to had buffet style meats and you cooked them yourself at the table). We also had a Hite which went well with the meal.  I will be going back to Honey Pig, the menu is good, the staff was friendly (even with the language barrier), and the price is hard to beat.  I may check out the lunch as it's $5 cheaper and the only things they don't offer are the tongue and the  short ribs.",

It has become my \"regular\" Korean bbq spot.   Since I've been going there so much, they know me by now and are very much attentive whenever my boyfriend and I walk in. They immediately bring over the AYCE menu and the brisket dipping sauce that we love so much! (if you haven't tried it, be sure to ask for it, it tastes good with everything!) I honestly couldn't ask for better service.   Also, their pork belly has defeated all other pork bellies in any other Korean bbq restaurant (for me at least). Last time I ordered pork belly at a Korean bbq restaurant in California, it tasted so bland and flavorless. Honey Pig's pork belly is so full of flavor that you almost feel like you just can't stop eating it. My boyfriend has even grown to love it, and he's not a big fan of pork belly.  If you are in Vegas and looking for a great AYCE Korean bbq  restaurant, this is your place. AYCE is served until 10 pm, but as long as you get there before 10, they'll serve you past that time.",

Thankfully, despite reading reviews when you want something bad enough the best way to know for sure is to try it yourself.  The food:  definitely not the best kbbq I have ever had, especially for the price. The choices are so limited and there are a few things you can only order once. Hello! It's supposed to be AYCE.  For the price you pay, you would think they would have more options on the menu.  The service:  a lot better than I was expecting! Our drinks were refilled promptly, the food we ordered came out quickly, the staff was overall really fast and efficient.",

Come here with your appetite, because the portions are huge! We had the spiced beef and at our server nearly insisted that we have the pork belly, we also had another beef dish that the server recommended, all incredibly tasty.  My boyfriend also had the cold noodles, and tells me they are as authentic as the ones his mother made when he was kid, he nearly licked the bowl.   All the food is cooked at your table and our server was incredibly friendly and helpful.",

Our waitress Serah was on it and came back to our grill everytime our meat needed flipping and she is the cutest thing ever! The korean bbq ribs were my fav but the rest of the meat I was not impressed by... Porkbelly, spicy porkbelly, kim chi, onion salad. They give you water mixed with barley which isnt the best tasting but I guess if its apart of their culture I will give it a shot. This is not the worst place ever but I have been to other korean bbq's that have just exceeded my expectations in flavor, price and atmosphere so I am just comparing it to my other experiences.",

We decided to do all you can eat and started off with bulgogi, short ribs, and beef brisket..they just brought out the bulgogi and forgot the rest. When we asked for the rest, the waitress said 'okay' and made it seem like we didn't order it from the beginning. We also asked for drinks but even after 15min, they didn't bring anything (not even water).   The quality of the food wasn't all that great either. Didn't leave a good impression that I want to go back again..   Only good thing is parking! Since it's in a shopping complex there's tons of parking.",

    "text": "Craving Korean BBQ, my boyfriend took me here for our little date today.  We came in around 2 pm and it was completely dead inside, meaning there was absolutely no one except the waitress.  This suited me just fine because it felt like we had our own private room to ourselves and the waitress focused on us the whole time.  The ambiance of the place is nice, each table set up with its own personal BBQ grill and it feels pretty cozy.    Since it was our first time there, the waitress recommended that we share a combo meal, which we proceeded to choose B set.  As we waited for the ingredients to come out, the waitress handed us a pitcher of what looked like tea.  Since we asked for water, we were pretty confused but we tried it anyway.  It definitely was not my cup of tea, excuse the pun.  To me, it tasted like cold red bean water, yuck.  After that, everything was great.  The waitress kept bringing out different foods for us to eat, the majority of which I had no idea what it was but I was feeling adventurous and tried everything.  Believing that my boyfriend and I were going to cook our own BBQ, I was again confused when the waitress started doing it for us.  I'm not sure if she did it cause that's how this place operated or if it was because we were the only ones in there and she was bored, but we had our own personal chef and it was great.  She cooked it perfectly and the food tasted amazing.    Overall, I say this is a great place to go on a date or with friends.  However, the only other downfall that I could find in this place was that the prices were pretty expensive for a little Korean BBQ place located in the corner of a Chinatown mall.  The total for my boyfriend and I sharing that one combo meal came out to about $44.  I'd definitely come back again every once in a while for a nice date, but its not a place to come often if you're short on money.",

    "text": "We were so excited to come here because the one in LA is really good and had pretty good reviews on here. But we were sorely disappointed in the customer service and AYCE policy.  The food tasted okay for the most part though.   It is located in a plaza in Chinatown, not on the LV Strip.    We got here about 8 pm and there was no wait.  When we got to our table, we noticed this huge domed grill, it looked like a lid or an overturned wok.  It was cool.    We ended up with AYCE for our group of 6 at $19.99 each.  When we proceeded to order our favorites, we were told we can only order 2 items at a time.  We are used to limited items, but usually 4-5, which was fine.  After we cooked the first batch, they told us we had to finish everything before they would take our order for the next round.  Our grill was sitting there empty while we were starving & waiting for our food to be brought out by the wait staff.  Other tables had full grills most of the time, while we sat there with nothing on ours.    We ordered different items on the menu including:  beef tongue - good, thin sliced meat  spicy octopus - quarter sized when cooked, was okay  kalbi (short ribs) - marinated fatty meat, not great :(  sides - not so fresh, marinated cucumbers had a weird flavor  dipping sauces - did not look appetizing either  spicy \"bulgogi\" (brisket) - kinda weird looking...  this did not look like our usual bulgogi, so we asked about it.    Us:  What is that? (as we pointed to it cooking on the grill) Waiter:  It's spicy bulgogi Us:  It doesn't look like bulgogi Waiter:  It's brisket with other meats all clumped together Us:  Huh? Waiter:  It has other meats and brisket mixed together Us:  (We still had quote bubbles with question marks)  I just looks like pork, didn't we order brisket?  We would have tried other meats, but we were only \"allowed\" to eat so much due to being micro-managed by the waiter/waitress not giving us our food.  After we got on our car and started pulling away, the 2 servers ran up to our car saying they charged the wrong amount.  Even though they charged the wrong amount, we totaled it correctly and made sure to tip.  I asked, did you even look at what we gave total?  He didn't and said, \"oh, you paid the correct amount and tipped too?\"  It made is feel like we were trying to not pay. Then complained we only gave $20 tip.  I will give 3 stars for the flavors of the meats & sides, but need to take 2 stars off for service.  I would suggest to order from the menu a la carte instead of AYCE, you'll probably be more satisfied.  We probably would have been charged half the price considering how much we ate, actually it was more like how much they wanted to give us.  If you want to be micromanaged when eating, having someone tell you how much to eat at an AYCE place and getting a smirk for \"only\" giving $20 tip, then come here.  Otherwise, there are so many other buffets in Vegas that are so much more worth it.  The AYCE Korean BBQs in Los Angeles are SO MUCH BETTER, food-wise and service wise.  The waitstaff need to go to Customer Service 101 classes.  Note:  This is my 1st less than 3 star review out of 80 that I've written.  Definitely not worth it for the service as others have said.  Disappointed!  :(",

    "text": "The pig is my go-to spot for my Korean BBQ needs on Spring Mountain! There are many restaurants around America that share the same name but none of them come close to the one we have in Vegas! (Ellicott City, Maryland  and Annandale, VA I'm taking to you!)   The AYCE has become a mythical and almost secretive thing at this place as of late. Every time we come here they give us the regular dinner menus w/o the little AYCE insert. We always have to ask for it..   They have also added a few quirks to the AYCE as of late:   1. You need to order from the top of the menu and work your way down. If you try and skip around they have a cow!.              A. My theory is this: they try to fill you up with the cheap cuts of meat first. You notice that the brisket, tongue and pork belly are on the top of the menu. hmm?!?             B. The second and hopefully True theory is because the spicy pork kills the UFO grill and anything you cook after that tastes like ashes. Pork is cheaper than beef so my first theory may be moot.   2. Only one order of sirloin and kalbi per person.  So technically it's not a True AYCE. Quick tip: if you smile at the girls and bat your eyes in such a flirtatious way they may hook up another serving... Sometimes it works...    I have had their regular menu food namely the Kim chee chigae and dol sot bi bim bap. Both dishes were legit but cost just as much as the AYCE experience. Unless you are craving a Korean pancakes or something specific stick to the AYCE as it provides the best bang for the buck.   Enjoy!  PS: Don't forget to wear dark clothes because every seat is a splash zone!",

I called honeypig and asked if they still have the AYCE and she said it's only up to 10 pm but she suggested that they have a combination for 2 people worth $42.99. So we went there, had a table and when I looked up their menu, I saw the combi that the girl was talking about. It's $42.99 for just a brisket and marinated beef, fried rice, soup and sodas or alcohol. And I asked the server, \"is this a lot?\" (Because we were thinking of just going to Sura Bbq) and the server said \"yes that's a lot\". So me and my husband decided to order it coz' we are expecting it's a lot of servings but gosh when we saw it, it's just so little. And the service was so poor. And they almost forgot to give us a rice. It was supposed to be a fried rice but then they gave us a white rice,  since we're super hungry and waited for 30 mins just for the rice, we took it. Overall, I don't like this restaurant. It's not worth the pay. We should have gone to Sura Bbq or just waited at Tofu Hut to be seated. We are really upset and disappointed. I won't recomment this place.",

    "text": "This was a tough one to review, and really could've swung from a two to four star at any given hour.  Food -- 4.5 stars.  we had Korean BBQ,, meaning the meat is cooked at your table.  We had an excellent combo for $50 dollars or so that easily fed our table of three.  There was planety of Bancha (sp? side dishes) that came with the Order,, though kind of bland.  We received pork belly, pork neck, short rib, and bulgogi (a little sweet) and prime rib.  Unlike most KBBQ places, the servers actually placed everything and starting the cooking process.  Service -- 2.5 stars.  This is definitely the achilles heel.  Having read a lot of review, we went at like 5:15 PM.  We had excellent service in the very early going.  However, as more people came in the staff was entirely slammed.  They were a good staff,,, but ENTIRELY understaffed.  They could have easily had two more food servers/runners and all would've been busy.    Drink 3 stars-- Reasonably priced but kind of a small collection,,, of course we had Hite beer.  Price 3.5 stars -- The portions are pretty darn large.  For $50 our combo served three pretty strong eaters and we were stuffed at the end.  I would certainly return,, and would like to try the hot pots next time.  It's a good place,,, but I will definitely be cognizant of the hours that I go.  To echo most thers,, definite potential for a 4-5 star,, but some problems for now that keep their ceiling low.",

    "text": "I am conflicted on how to rate Honey Pig. I liked the quality of the meat and the fact that they basically cook everything for you. What I am not a huge fan of is how understaffed they are, the upcharge on items without notice, the lack of kalbi during lunch, and the limitation of it on dinner.   We rolled in as a large party of 10 and sat in the back. It took some time for the lady to get to us and start the grill. Half our party was eating while the rest of us were waiting to start. When we began, we were happy with the food for the most part. The meat could have used some seasoning if the sesame oil dipping sauce was not to come with salt. The marinated meat just tasted too sweet.  Once we got started, the attendant started to loosen up. We didn't eat that much and asked for the bill halfway through. It threw her off and she kept offering to bring out more food if we needed. Overall, she was rather nice, but we all had to get to work or do errands. Honey Pig was decent, but I have other places I would go first if the need for Korean BBQ hits.",

    "text": "This place has real potential, but unfortantely for them... weird policies and horrible service kills it. I've heard a lot of great things about Honey Pig, but I just don't see where people are getting from.  Honey Pig is slightly different than the other KBBQ places in town. Unlike the other spots, the Pig has huge cast iron dome. They grill most of the side dishes and still leave space for the meats if you order AYCE.  The AYCE has alot of catches. The menu doesn't indicate it, but you can only have one order of the rib-eye, which sucks cause that is usually my favorite dish. I found it odd because pretty much every other AYCE KBBQ joints has unlimited portions of Kalbi. The AYCE is limited to pretty much from 5pm - 10pm. So look to Sura, Woo-che, or Tofu for a light night fix. I found the Bulgogi to be incredibly sweet, seemed like it was over marinated. The spicy pork and beef tongue were on point. The side dish choices are limited and inconsistent. We went one time and they didn't even offer kim-che until we asked for it. WTF?  The service here sucked. We came in for lunch were 1 of 2 parties in the whole restaurant but we still couldn't get decent service. Our server forgot our orders, messed up some of the sauces and we had to hunt her down for re-fills. The 2 times I have been here I have been disappointed, not sure if I can suck it up and come back for a third.",

If you've been here before and the menu seems a little fishy, demand for the LOCAL MENU!!! I'll leave it at that...  Had some visitors from Minnesota during our cold front. Two were noobs and the other two were well experienced Korean BBQ specialists. We all jump on the AYCE menu. Banchan sides were set with a bunch of garlic and jalapeno peppers.                       (please forgive me if I spelled the food incorrectly)  Round 1: Beef brisket (Chadol Baegi) and beef tongue (Gyutan). It's what's for dinner. Noobies weren't big fans of the beef tongue. Both tasted good, although I prefer the brisket over anything that can taste me back.  Round 2, 3, & 4: Pork Belly (Samgyeopsal). This was THE BUSINESS!!! These cuts were GIANORMOUS!!! Even the noobies were in awe by the majestic slabs of pork belly staring them in their eyes. PORK BELLY GET IN MY BELLY!!!   Round 5:  Marinated beef short ribs (Galbi). We finished off the feeding with something marinated. Not that big of a fan, but it was good. I'll pho'ks with it.   Honey Pig's brisket and pork belly got me hooked again. Only time will tell if they can stay consistent. We've been lucky to keep getting the same waitress which is on top of her game. I'll be watching for anymore bamboozlement.   YAY! I'M A FAN!!!",

Well, table set up but no condiments around--- wasn't sure if this is how it's done here but easily forgiven since kids were rambunctious anyway.  Seated and no one explained menu so we just figured it out and then waited. And waited and waited. Where  is the water? And Where is the waiter? I was gonna bail when he came just in time.   Did the $24.99 a person dinner deal---(shrimp lovers, only one order a person). Ordered down the list and once main items  here only then did condiments come.   I was okay until he left again. Where's my water? Didn't I order beer too? I know we in Vegas but I wasn't drunk. After a 15 minute wait, I ended up going to car to get my kids their water bottle. What in the world?  He ended up bringing some meat but it was so slow we finished all in one order and nothing else came ... So we had to say \"just bring it all, we will cook ourselves\". So we did. Happily. Asked for pitcher of water to serve ourselves. Now I'm at a point wondering why are we Even paying? Tell me it's not for Service --- because That deserves Minus stars.   Meat quality truly not up to standard, shrimp was soft even when fully cooked. Pork belly fatty, Galbi is okay. The most frustrating thing----the tip!   $25 per person x 6 + 12.50 x 2  = $175 (Kids over 4 years 1/2 price.) Give and take tips maybe a bit over $200 but  Tips a whopping $35.00 included. Grrrr  And for what??? No service, slow food, no beer when asked, extremely slow to come utensils, and darn it again where's my water?!  Went to restroom and didn't even see a sign for it. No matter, We all knew out way out the door very well.   Honey pig you left us a bitter taste.",

Quality luncheon meat may sound like an oxymoron, but I believe there is a difference between, Walmart's Food Club spam and Spam spam.  One is airy and spongey and the other is a dense, salty, surpise pack of meaty goodness.  Honey Pig uses the former. Also for its tubed meats I am normally used to the slices curling up after they have been boiled...not before..which means a bit dried up.  Also the broth does not appear to be the anchovey or seaweed broth that some places use.  This broth appears to be courtesy of Lake Mead.   Sides were very good however. Tasty water kim chi and other sides   Great friendly service even at 2 am.",

I often get these places confused because I visit many when I am in town but if I find out I reviewed the wrong restaurant I will correct it, but I am almost certain Honey Pig is the place I am thinking.  I would rank this as a top 5 korean bbq in Vegas.  I typically get brisket & chicken with rice.    The side dishes can make or break a korean restaurant & there is a general consensus on what \"should\" be served & this place falls in line.  Staff is friendly & they speak enough english to work smoothly (not to be mean but some places couldn't get my order no matter how slow I spoke).  The food was good & korean bbq is usually on the expensive side & this place was average in the price.",

One thing that I love about it is the grill, it cooks the meat fast and you don't have to worry about any pieces of meat falling through to its firey death . Lettuce and garlic is free which is a must for me when eating kbbq.   First time I went we had the all you can eat option. Pretty much tried everything on the menu. My favorite was the kalbi and the brisket. As far as the rest of the meats, they were good and were able to satisfy my craving . However it is not the best quality . The servers were nice and helped to occasionally cut/turn the meat to make sure they are not being burnt . I did have to ask however for the Korean tea which they didn't bring out until I asked .   Second time I went we had the combo set A . It consisted of the pork belly and brisket as the meats as well as a choice of Korean soup and fried rice to end the meal. A drink was also included (1 bottle soju or beer ). My two friends I went with aren't big eaters so I got to eat most of it ! I found the set to be good for those who can't eat much . It was yummy and had a lot of variety .   Overall i think honey pig is a good option if you want all you can eat bbq any time of the day . Especially because they are open 24/7 ! Their combo options are nice if you would like a smaller option but also have an option for all you can eat .",

Out of the 3 KBBQs I've been to in Las Vegas, this is the only AYCE where the servers actually come around and cook your meat for you which is convenient. They have a decent grade of meat and there's a variety to order from.   The banchans are nicely seasoned and they usually bring out Jun (korean pancake) and some cheesy corn (which I still don't understand why you would eat Korean food with cheesy corn) to place on the grill. They also bring you plenty of kimchi and kong-namul (bean sprouts) which they'll grill for you to enjoy with the meat.  At the end of your meal definitely ask for the fried rice (I think it's a little extra). They'll add rice, eggs, veggies, and whip you up some kimchi fried rice with whatever meat you still have grilling. Yum!  As this was the first AYCE KBBQ I discovered in Las Vegas, I would come here until I discovered Tofu Hut. Honey Pig is a bit pricier (over $25 I believe for dinner) where Tofu Hut is $17 and also comes with my favorite steamed egg and bean paste soup.   Honey Pig is good, but not the best in my opinion.",

    "text": "(AYCE BBQ Review)  Make sure you don't stuff yourself silly and save some room for the fried rice towards the end of BBQ'ing your meats. I seriously save some of my grilled meat/ kimchi/ soybean spouts and wait to enjoy them with the fried rice. That is the best and only reason that makes honey pig a step above the rest of their competitors. The fried rice costs an extra $2.95 per person, but it's worth it! My boyfriend and I just ordered one portion and it was more than enough for the two of us to share.  This location offers exactly the same dining experience as the California locations. The service here is amazing (and that's saying a lot for this type of dining), the prices are competitive, the meats are a step above most AYCE Korean BBQ places and not to mention they are conveniently open 24 hours.   We did the AYCE dinner which is $25 per person. The only limitation we encountered - you can only order 1 order (1 rib) of kalbi (marinated short rib) per person. The kalbi meat was moist, slightly on the fatty side, but tasty and well marinated.   If all else fails, order the pork belly! We were extremely impressed with the quality of the pork belly here, I mean c'mon, this place is called honey pig; the pig is where it's at! It was super fresh, buttery, juicy and melt-in-your-mouth good; we had to get a second (& third) round.   We also tried the thinly sliced beef brisket (too plain and dry for my taste) and the spicy pork (seasoned well and tender) but my tastebuds wanted more grilled and glistening pork belly. It's soooo good.   All of the banchan offered were basic, nothing overly impressive, but they were solid additions to the meal. Also, the salad that comes with the meal is pretty standard. You can request rice or radish wraps if you want to enjoy them with your grilled meats as well.   I can't say enough amazing things about the fried rice at the end, they add seasoned rice with bits of leafy greens onto the same hot grilling pan and fry it in the meat, pork belly and grilled kimchi juices. The best way to fry your rice is to let your rice sit on the pan for a few minutes, without moving it, letting it get super crispy and charred. If you're smart, you saved a supply of some grilled meat (preferably pork belly), grilled and charred kimchi and soybean sprouts and fry the rice all together with those goodies. Before you know it - your fried rice is ready to feast on and it was soooo worth the wait!",

The server didn't seem to be great with the food as she kept burning the meat and never adjusted the temp down.  The marinated beef was super dry and hard.  Overall, not high quality all the way around.  Willing to give it another try but seems like there are better Korean BBQ places in the area.",

I definitely recommend this place. the only thing I notice they should improve on is that they forget to bring some things you order when it gets busy, so prepare to remind certain staff members if you don't see your rice or soups. their banchan is usually a good array of some of my favorite types of pickled veggies and styles of kimchi. not going to be disappointed with this place.",

Price-wise, Honey Pig is a bit more expensive compared to their competitors, but I think the food makes up for the price. The pork belly isn't frozen like some restaurants and the service is pretty quick.  However, this isn't a True AYCE Korean BBQ because there are some things on the menu that you can only order once (boo!).   The servers check on you pretty often and cook the meat for you as well, which is a plus.   The atmosphere of the restaurant really reminded me of Seoul as the servers would greet you in Korean and frequently spoke to each other in Korean (which I shamelessly eavesdropped in, hehehe).  A downside is that their ventilator system isn't as good as other restaurants, so you will leave the restaurant smelling like BBQ.",

I haven't had Kimchi Chigae (Kimchi stew) like that in over 7 years. Meat quality for yakiniku was good also. They do offer lunch and Dinner \"All you can eat\" specials. as well as ala carte platters for the grill. Don't forget to wash down that bbq with some SOJU! oh YUM YUM. Nothing better than some good bbq and drinks to end your day after work or to crave that hunger monster after a good night out on the strip and clubs!!!   the best part????

We were given appetizers we didn't even know what they were--until we asked. Hi. WE'RE NEW. Help us out, bro. I had a hair in my salad AND in my eggplant. Did I tell them about it? No. Why bother. I knew I'd never come back. Anyhoo, they plopped down the food and it cooked and we ate it. It was just OK. Shrimp was worthless. Mind not blown. A couple next to us ordered food. It was literally cooking on the burner when they got up and left. We should've followed them. For $70 I could've gone so many other places. I won't be returning to this place.",

    "text": "A place called \"Honey Pig,\" how can you not like it?!    We've been on a mission to try out this Korean restaurant after passing by and seeing heaping piles of food being grilled in the center of the tables.  Last night, with a party of five, we finally had a chance.  We knew right away it was best to get a combo - so #2 Honey Pig Combo for $59.99 it was.  It's meant for about three to four people, so we figured we could add more later on.  It comes with Korean Pork, Beef Prime, Neck Flesh of Pork, Hot Baby Octopus, Seafood Bean Paste Soup, Fried Rice, and either 1 bottle of Soju or Korean Beer.  After putting in our order, the waiter came back with iced Korean tea.  This was actually the first time I have ever seen the tea served on ice and it was very refreshing.  Something so nice needs to be served in tall glasses instead of small regular tea cups.  About nine different banchan was brought over, which included cabbage kim chee, bean sprouts, cucumber kim chee, green onion salad, fish cake, tiny fish, raw garlic, sliced jalapenos, pickled daikon, a bean dipping paste, and my favorite - sesame oil with Korean salt.  He only brought over one dish of each, so we were soon requesting refills on just about everything.  The raw foods were soon to arrive and the waiter laid out the beef and pork onto the hot wok-like grill in the center.  He also added some bean sprouts and cabbage to the middle.  As we waited for our meat to cook, we dove into the banchan.  We also asked about the rice, which he then brought over five bowls of steamed white rice ($2/each).  As we devoured our meat and our grill became empty, we sat around wondering about our octopus.  It was sitting in a bowl on the next table, but we weren't sure what to do next since they had shut our fire off.  When we finally got their attention, they asked if we wanted our bill.  We asked about the octopus, and only then did he realize that it was still sitting raw on the next table.  So, he turned on the grill and cooked the octopus.  The BF asked about the soup, and only then did the waiter ask if we wanted our fried rice.  (Uh...yeah!)  We were quite bothered by this since they were already asking us if we wanted to pay and we hadn't received half of our meal still!  The fried rice was also added to the grill and we got two bowls of the soup to share amongst us.  We really enjoyed the food - it was tasty, great flavor, and just a good meal overall.  4 stars for food.  The service on the other hand is what makes me frustrated.  We were forgotten about, and I'm not sure if it's because we were in the corner or what.  We always had to ask about getting our tea refilled, and when we asked if we could just have the pitcher, they said no. (They only had one pitcher!)  I asked for more napkins, which never arrived until I asked again.  The different waiters would come by and shut the heat off before our food was cooked and it was just so hard to get their attention.  (One waiter finally mentioned that they were understaffed with only three waiters that night.  They just looked unorganized.)  We finally said we were ready for the check, which also took forever to come!  (Did they want us to pay or not?)  2 stars for the service.  I'm used to getting shikhye at the end of the meal, but they didn't have it here either!  Argh!  I definitely want to go back, but I can only hope the service will be a lot better the next time!  (And I'm sure we're going to bring a larger party the next time we come too!)  Sidenote: They offer a 20% from 10 pm to 8 am.  Are they open 24 hours then?  I'm not sure!   (You can find pics of our dinner in the business profile!)",

No she doesnt . They were just lying to us bc we looked innocent i guess? and the shitty thing is when i told them about the drinks they said they dont give drinks for combos bc its convention dates. wtf? dont do business like that.",

    "text": "The best part of Honey Pig is the name....  This cozy Korean corner spot is nestled away in the same plaza as Raku and Pho So 1.  The decor is mostly wood and very nuetral tones, giving the feeling of being in someone's basement.    I wanted to satisfy my Dolsot BiBimBop craving and although  this is more of a BBQ place,  Bibimbop is a staple of Korean cuisine, so I thought why not?    They didn't have Dolsot (the hot clay pot) so I just went with the regular version of the delicious dish.  When my meal came out, I was surprised to see the rice was not in the bottom of the bowl, but rather in a small bowl on the side.  The rice was luke warm, as if it had been sitting for a while.  When I mixed all of the ingredients together the dish was bland, with vegetables cut to all sorts of sizes.  While it's hard for me to not enjoy Bibimbop, this was the most unenjoyable version I've experienced.    I'm not sure I'd come back to try the BBQ since there are many other options in town, and while I love the name Honey Pig, I can't say the same for the rest of the experience.",

So we went to Honey Pig instead to see about their noodle options. We went in past 1 am and a guy named Kim was our server. I ordered the spicy beef & vegetable noodle soup. It was a terrible idea!! It had an unappetizing smell, the vegetables were old and when I stated that to our server Kim he was trying to tell me that that's how the green beans in the soup were supposed to look even though he didn't know what they were initially. They didn't even hold the form of a green bean. Like oh \"my bad Kim, my bad that I said something about these green beans that look like they were purchased back in 2016.\" The worst of the worst was, when I stated I did not want to pay for the food for being like that, he argued with me for a handful of minutes as to why I should pay for it because it was already ordered. I had to plead my case with him and he wouldn't bend even through the analogies.",

No wait, we were greeted as soon as we walked in. We ordered, short ribs, brisket (always a must have when I eat Kbbq) and pork belly. Server cooked our food for us, very friendly but I prefer to cook my own food. I don't like my meat over cooked. Food was great, service was great. The reason for the 3 is I tried to use the 20% off with yelp check in but they told me it wasn't for the AYCE and it doesn't state that on Yelp. If I had known that, I don't think we would have dined there. But, we got our Kbbq fix for the night and we left full.",

    "text": "This meal was a wonderful surprise. I went with a group of friends from work to celebrate a birthday. I had no idea what I was in for.   We all enjoyed the 'All You Can Eat' option, and it's a good thing we did! We were delighted to find an array of vegetables set out before us - some pickled, some not. (My favorite was the pickled radish.) The server brought round after round of delicious meat and placed it on the cooking surface. You take it upon yourself to move the meat around, flipping and moving it around the surface. There's a serving of Kim chi and bean sprouts on the surface the entire time. You are served seasoned brisket, pork belly, seasoned beef, a delightful bulgogi and spicy chicken.  Take your time and enjoy everything that is presented to you - especially the things that intimidate you the most. They serve the most amazing roasted rice tea that will keep you requesting refills. It's a delightfully quenching and refreshing brew with a flavor that cleanses the palette in an beautiful way.   My tips for you:  - Put the garlic cloves on the cooking surface. When they are grilled, they are amazing. - Let the beef get a dark char on it, then let it sit in the sesame oil for a minute before eating it.  - The pork belly is INCREDIBLE when you let it carmelize on both sides. It it wonderful with sesame oil on it as well.  - At the end, after the chicken - request that the next round is bulgogi fried rice. Let the rice sit there until you think it's burning, then let it sit some more. The goal is to get the rice cooked onto the cooking surface. It will caramelize and create the most amazingly sticky sweet crispy goodness. You'll have to use the metal spoon and some elbow grease to scrap it from the surface. It's worth every little bit of effort.   At the end of your meal, they will bring you cantaloupe to start the digestive process.   I hope you enjoy this as much as I did :)",

They didn't do all you can eat because it was holiday weekend which was fine. They didn't give you a lot of meat for the combo for the price. The portion was only good for one person. The meat was touch. They kept insisting we get fried rice after we said several times that we'll rather have white rice. I had to ask several times for the soup that came with the combo. I checked in right when we got there and I got a 20% off offer from the Yelp check in and they said I couldn't use it because it was holiday. So I asked someone else and she said I couldn't use it because it ended in Feb. clearly they just didn't want to give me the 20% offer code. Will not be coming back.",

I feel a big part of the appeal of Korean restaurants is their banchan, or side dishes, but the choices are lacking in both variety and taste. The venue is also...meh. More like a casual grub joint. Service was friendly but rather understaffed and slow. Not a personal favorite. Probably not coming back on my own.",

    "text": "The All You Can Eat Dinner for $25 is the best! :))    Up here in vegas for vacation and was craving some authentic asian food since me and my bf have been eating soooo much american or fast food. Really wanted yakiniku, searched for places in this area and based on the pictures we came here :) Everything was yum, the dinner special comes with brisket and pork belly for the first course, I LOVE pork belly so yessss, of course it takes forever to cook through so the wait was agonizing but the brisket was there hehe. There was kimchee cabbage and bean sprouts put right on the grill which was cool, korean side dishes are delicious.     The servers even come and check on your food and flip it if its ready and cut it up with the meat shears, so helpful. The next course we had were short ribs (YES), it was three slabs of the short ribs which was a lot so we knew the next time to get half portions of the meats. Then we got half spicy pork belly (yes), half spicy chicken (okay), half short ribs again (obvi yes).    Oh we also each got a bowl of white rice which is included with the special, the sauces and sides and meat were great and we were so stuffed and satisfied by the end of the meal. Definitely recommend as a great yakiniku spot in the area! Would so come back if we weren't trying to go to different places, but maybe next time :)))",

    "text": "So I went to Honey Pig today after so many years of go to Pho So 1 and seeing Honey Pig Korean BBQ down by the corner.  It was a little weird I have to say.  My family and I always eat rice with meat and soup at Kbbq places.  This place serves it at the end. This was just different...but may be it's traditional I don't know I'm not Korean.  We walked in and sat down right behind the fish tank.  They got a pot of hot tea for us right away( we didn't ask, that was nice) We got combo A which came with brisket and pork belly.  I like the banchan and the service was really good.  The waiter came and gave us second serving of banchan which was great because we liked pretty much everything.  Since combo A came with 2 different meats only the banchan help filled us up.  There were 3 adults and one small child.  It came out to be $43.22.  It even came with 2 sodas that we splited.  It wasn't that crowed because it was 39 degrees out.  Overall it was good, the waitress came and ask us if we wanted the fried rice, we said yes.  She cooked it for us and we ate and it was very nice.  I have to come back and do AYCE because I didn't get to try all the other meats they offer. It might get 4 stars next time.   BTW, if you're ever in L.A. there's a place that I like that they make porridge at the end of the meal.  The place is called Seoul Garden on Olympic & Alvarado, The 5 course meal is called Jingee-skan... it is so AWESOME!!! I MISS THAT PLACE!!!!!",

    "text": "All You Can Eat awesomeness for only $20 a head.  I'm from San Jose, CA and it gets pretty damn pricey for All You Can Eat Korean BBQ.  Being in Vegas, don't come here right before a night out or you'll smell like food the whole night.  Come here strictly for eating.  All you can eat is now for a limited time during the evening so make sure you check first.  But this place is still good to order off the menu.  But if you're hungry....go during All You Can Eat hours....SUPER worth it.  My boyfriend and my homies came here this past weekend and I treated for Mother's Day.  It was definitely worth it at $20 per person because we ate A LOT.  We ordered like 5 orders of beef tongue, 2 orders of pork belly, 1 order of roast beef, 1 order of BBQ ribs, 2 order thinly sliced beef, and we even got the small calf intestines.      Everything tasted good.  All the meat was flavorful, was well marinated, and easy to cook.  They help you out in the beginning, but while you're sitting there, you get to finish off the cooking yourself. I don't recommend the roast beef though because its cubed.  I like thin sliced.  Faster to cook and tastes way better.  The salad, kim chi, sprouts, and other side dishes were all good too.  Be careful though, they can make you full.  But the salad is yummy...no need for rice!  Come here in a group.  It is a fun and interacitve  dining experience that should be shared among good people on a good night for good vibes!",

    "text": "Honey Pig, another one of the many Korean bbq's in Las Vegas.   Locating this place was an adventure itself; as it hides in the corner of the plaza  right next to Big lots! and the famous Pho So 1.  Once you've found this place and enter the restaurant make sure to make yourself known to the employees you're here.  It would help if you know Korean, but a simple wave and stepping away from the fish aquarium that obstructs the pathway into the dining area works too.  I went with the AYCE option that they have for $19.95 and what my appetite was wanting.    The servers bring all the food and sides at the small round stove table, which we hardly had any place to place things the more items we received.  I did enjoy the complimentary barley tea that they provided with some lemons to quench my thirst.  They would all have the courtesy to cut the meat (just like mom) when it would have large pieces of pork belly sizzling on the stove.    The Atmosphere is great, but when you're already deaf from listening to your ipod with ear buds; it seemed like I was yelling at everyone as it can get pretty rowdy in here.  Especially as it gets busier, you find yourself in competition with other tables trying to get the attention of your server.   But when you get the attention and they bring the meat (and they bring it..) enjoy the natural flavors of the meat, because there isn't much seasoning to the meats.  I found my favorite to be the bulgogi (but of course who goes to a Korean Bbq  place and not order that).  Over all Honey Pig has filled my hunger, and quenched my thirst when I'm looking to other options. ^_^",

There goes the all you can eat concept. I felt that the meat choices was very limited compared to most AYCE BBQ places, especially the original ones in LA. They cook for you which is good and bad. They don't seem to like when you stir the beef yourself and usually come quickly when you do. The kids are half off, which is a good deal at lunch but not dinner, especially since the menu options are the same for both meals. The grill is nice and large, but doesn't let the meat drip out of the pan (it drips down but touches all the other meat in its path). Would I come back? Probably, but it's not a place to write home about. And btw... Someone tell me an AYCE place in Vegas where I can get rice paper with my meal!",

My favorite is the pork belly and the galbi. For the galbi you only get one order per dinner so that's not a True all you can eat. I like that when you ask for meat, they don't give you large portions so you don't get too sick of eating one thing for a while.  I also like that they put  the kimchi on the grill.   I knocked off one star because I ordered their spicy beef soup and it did not come until my friends were almost done eating. I think they forgot to put in the order and only realized when I reminded them about it. I knocked off another half a star because the service wasn't all too great. Our main server wasn't too friendly and seemed too cool to be serving us.   This is my second time here and I'll be back for their ayce menu!\".",

The place might get overcrowded and there are few reasons: prices, huge portions and tasty food indeed. We come here a big company 6 people strong. We offered the largest Korean bbq item on the menu. The price was $28 per person which is really cheap for such a fest! As you can guess, we couldn't even finish our food. I am the little bit sorry for the leftovers, it's a pity such a great food to be deposited. I wish they have a more flexible price to avoid wasting the precious food. Just to mention, that the taste of the bibimbap here is really remarkable. I have tried many variations of this bowl meal, have tasted many flavor and textures, but here they are making it unforgettable.",

The pork belly is almost crunchy but so juicy and very deep satisfactory without any spice added except the grilled garlic and onion (see photo).  The brisket is the right choice and it went well with the dipping sauce, sweet or salty.  I  not a drinker sp I opt for barley tea, very different than green tea or jasmine tea. It gave me a whole lot of different perpective in term of tea. I definitely recommend to my friends and I will come back.",

Probably the cheapest (comparing to Chicago prices) Korean BBQ place I've seen. The meat is also just amazing and tender. The cha dol was my favorite. It was juicy and buttery. The service was amazing as well. Maybe it wasn't that busy that night but the waitress basically cooked all the meat for USA's we just chowed down. The salad thing that comes with is also good. I wish they had some in Chicago!",

Long story short, 2 tables showed up about 5 minutes after us, got their food and drinks before us. Had to wave down the server to take our order after waiting 10 min, and then she walked away when we were still trying to order, so I figure I will just order more stuff when she comes back around. Then about another 5 minutes go by and a different server walks by, she asked if we ordered, I told her yes but we need our grill and would like drinks. She comes back with the drinks. So still no grill, and still waiting for our food. Finally we got fed up, cause we have been waiting longer than needed and the thought of waiting longer for a grill to come and heat up so we can start cooking, not worth it, so we left. They tried to tell us \"oh the food is coming\" ya no thank you. You have tables eating and been taking care after we arrived, go continue to take care of them.   I will keep my business with hwaro",

She also has a very nice presence and had a happy attitude the whole time which we really appreciated!  She was a superstar.. idk her name tho.. but she was great!

So we got the 3 people combo and each person gets their own soup or soft drink. I picked soft drink. Ok the grill pan is different from what I am used to seeing in Canada. Again this place later on the day or after 12 pm, it can get quite busy. Food is not bad and it's operated by Korean people. This place is not self grill. They actually grill the food for you. I like it.  Their side dishes are quite yummy. Decor is not fancy but it's clean in someways. I am guessing most local come here and eat.   Service is quite friendly and very attentive. You need anything they are on it right away.  There are plenty of parking outside because it is located in a mall  I highly recommend this place.",

    "text": "I'm a little perplexed at this \"3 stars average rating\" nonsense. Honey Pig is clearly better than that.  It's been quite some time since I've done Korean BBQ in Vegas, but there's no way a meat eater can resist a friend's invitation to feast. We arrived around 6pm on a Friday night and beat the dinner rush handily. Our chairs were placed fairly close to each other on purpose, as we would learn later.  It was fairly obvious from the a la carte pricing that AYCE ($24.95 all-you-can-eat dinner, supposedly a 2 hour limit, but we didn't reach it) would be the way to go for variety's sake. Late night diners should be aware that although this restaurant is open 24/7, AYCE is only available until 10pm. While they only allow a maximum of one portion of kalbi (beef short ribs) and one portion of beef sirloin with AYCE, the other options (bulgogi, pork belly, spicy pork belly, spicy squid, spicy chicken) are truly unlimited as long as you don't over-order.  Before the first round, they brought out banchan (the ubiquitous sides in Korean cuisine), which consist of bean sprouts, mini seafood pancakes, pickled veggies, and spicy cucumbers. The table space is essentially a circular ring that surrounds the circular grill, so the banchan were placed between the two of us. They also provided three dipping sauces (my simplistic summary: one salty, one sweet, and one spicy) and bowls of white rice.  For the actual first round, they threw kimchi and bean sprouts onto the grill along with bulgogi, then pork belly after the bulgogi had finished. They staged this on the opposite side of the circular ring so that they didn't get in our way. I wouldn't say that they totally follow through on the cooking process, but they will come back to turn the meat. Still, it feels like you can chopstick your way through it at any time and pull beef early to your liking, and that's a good thing. You should know that the outer edge of the grill will cook things more slowly, so relocate food there to avoid overcooking.  Anyway, the bulgogi and pork belly were both good, although I personally preferred the somewhat fatty pork belly. The sweet dipping sauce worked best with both, but I played around for variety's sake.  We wanted the kalbi and the beef sirloin for the second round, and they obliged. Both were actually marinated, and both stay pretty tender as long as you don't leave them on the grill for far too long. Yeah, we may have succumbed to this oversight. At least the properly cooked pieces tasted great!  Lastly, we had spicy chicken and also convinced them to mix it into an order of fried rice (+$2.95 per person). This fried rice is exciting because they cook it on the grill to pick up the meaty residues of the preceding deliciousness. It was certainly delicious overall. I'll admit that the spicy chicken and the leftover kimchi were a bit intense for me at first, but they were easier to handle once they'd cooled from hot to merely warm. Synergistic heat effects, you know. Anyway, they did allow us to box the leftovers of the fried rice (containing some chicken at this point) to go, and having food for the next day feels like more value than even taking the time to stuff yourself that night.  Nothing was totally mindblowing, but everything tasted very good, so why not 5 stars? Well, this is a bit nitpicky, but I'm disappointed with the limit on two types of especially delicious meat. It's understandable since some people can go absolutely H.A.M. on the food, but most places don't have that limit. Then again, my somewhat distant memories give me the impression that most AYCE places offer lower-quality meats. There is a second issue, however, in the lack of attention to giving more banchan. No server offered to bring more banchan, and one server outright said OK to more seafood pancakes, but never brought seconds.  I'll have to eat around more to make a more informed comparison, but I'm very comfortable giving Honey Pig 4 stars and decrying the ridiculous underrating by the \"average Yelper.\"",

Everything was scrumptious and cooked to perfection. It was a lot of food for two hungry tourist. The sauces were amazing and paired nicely with the meat. I've never had kimchi warm and that put the meal over the top for me. It won't come with white rice, ask for it but must also try to the fried rice! The server refilled our water several times. Very attentive.  My mouth is salivating just thinking about the all the goodness.",

The main difference between these two is that Honey Pig in Las Vegas has an AYCE option! I can choose between AYCE or the premium meats menu. This to me is what makes it far better than the one here in OC. While there is a difference when you get the better quality meat, I am too cheap to pay 35 to 40 dollars for a small tray of sliced premium meats at a Korean restaurant. My appetite is too massive to allow myself to be teased with the dinky portion of grass fed beef! LOL!! F all that crap! If I want to eat some premium meat or steak, I will go to Mastro's Steakhouse and order a 36 ounce tomahawk ribeye for 70 dollars and call it a day. Another thing I like about this place is that they will cook the food for you! It's nice getting that type of service! This will definitely be my regular go to spot, when I am in Henderson.",

For the most part, Honey Pig delivered - albeit a bit of a so-so one.   The place has been recommended to me by two separate friends.  I had fairly lofty expectations.  As you pull into the parking lot, trash flanks the place.  As my companion commented, it looked like fairly consistent trash.  Not something that just blew in with the day's breeze, something that had remained.    When we first arrived inside, the server (who I must say did a fine job manning the place all by herself - 10 tables) offered us a seat at a table that had a random used salad bowl and empty can of Coke sitting on it.  Me and my friend stared at the odd arraignment, but the server never acknowledged them.  They remained... almost like a centerpiece to our table until fifteen or so minutes into our experience when the server finally took them away unexplained.  The food was good - Korean BBQ fair.  We ordered one of the combo's for two people, which came with two types of beef, fried rice, salad, soup, and bean sprouts and kimchi.  The strange part came in the order - salad and meat first, then kimchi and bean sprouts, and then soup, and then finally fried rice.  It was an odd arraignment but overall decent.  The pricing also seemed a little off.  It was around $45 for the two of us for lunch.  Its not too high, but I guess when most of the cooking is done yourself and you do a whole lot of waiting, the financials seemed a bit steep.  Would I take the adventure again?  Most definitely.  But I'd probably choose a table on my own without the strange centerpiece.",

Unlike CA, where we cook the food ourselves, the waiters/waitresses came and turned our food for us. Every waiter turned our food at lease once in that restaurant and used the same tongs for raw meat as well as cooked meat. WHICH IS WAY TO MUCH CROSS CONTAMINATION FOR ME. Don't you have to take a health seminar and obtain a health card in order to work at a food restaurant in Las Vegas. That's like the first damn objective of the coarse. #strike2  The service was HORRIBLE. Some of the waitress' were friendly that's about the ONLY reason they even got a star. But they were in the back most of the time or on the other side of the restaurant \"watching tv\". We had probably gone about a little over 20 minutes before anyone came and checked on us. At that point it was #STRIKE3   Over $50.00 WASTED. I would have been better off going to McDonalds. At least their fast and have good customer service. Hell, a plain hamburger would've been better than this. SMH",

Totally different setting then tofu hut and definitely way more expensive as well. We had gotten a combo mean which included brisket, neck, and other meats as well as fried fried rice. Our total was about $70. It was a really great place and I would recommend it to friends but I'd much rather go to tofu hut and have all I can eat there.",

    "text": "For starters I'd just like to say I was really optimistic about this place in the beginning, but I was pretty turned off by a handful of things.   Firstly, they have about 4 beverage options. Literally. Coke, diet coke, sprite and unsweetened tea. I'm not a fan of soda, so I normally get water or lemonade. Who doesn't have lemonade!?!  Secondly, when the server was asking what I wanted for the AYCE, every time I told her what I wanted, she basically told me no. I asked for bulgogi, she said she will bring it later because \"she likes to cook the non marinated meats first.\" Then when I ask for fried rice, she says she can't do it until the end... So I'm guessing I was supposed to eat the rice all by itself?   Thirdly, the portions of the meat were very small and we finished them quite quickly and had to wait a while before we got any acknowledgement. Mind you we're literally the only people in the restaurant.  Fourthly, our server was sweeping/ moping in the middle of handling our food without washing his hands. They use the same tongs to handle the raw meat and the cooked meat, it's only a matter if time before someone gets sick from that.  So after one order of bulgogi and one pork belly, we left. We were in the restaurant eating for about 25 minutes total. I've never had suck crappy service. You get better service at mcdonalds.   And no. I didn't leave a tip.",

Beef short rib is THE BEST but make sure you see that some meats can only be ordered once! Only downfall of the restaurant for us. The grill itself is unique and the side dishes can be refilled, like usual. Pork belly and brisket are great too, but aren't marinated. Bulgogi is marinated, but can't beat the beef short rib, which is marinated and so soft.",

I thought we'd be still hungry, but it definitely filled us up (3 persons).  Service - it was a little bit slow in the beginning, but eventually picked up.  The waitresses were extremely friendly.  Food - good food, who doesnt like korean bbq (galbi, sahmgyupsahl).  the bokeunbap(fried rice) at the end was awesome.  Docked one star for the AYCE fakeout.",

One thing that stands out is the rounded grill that you put your food on. Most kbbq places have a regular flat, rectangle shaped grill. We ordered pork belly, brisket, pork neck, and bulgogi. The pork belly was thick and juicy and it was tasty. The brisket also tasted good. The pork neck was basically pork chop and there was nothing special about it. We also got a bunch of side dishes that came for free. I love how you get a bowl full of kimchi!  Everything tasted great.   Our waitress was also very kind. She helped us grill and always checked up on us. At the end of your meal you also get a complimentary cinnamon drink! It's suppose to cleanse you because you ate a bunch of oily foods.   This place is just as good as tofu hut if you're trying to compare it to other places. It's good, but Sura is still my #1.",

    "text": "Some might say that the problem with Korean BBQ is that there is just way too much variety at your fingertips, with the millions of little side dishes and the 10 different types of meat you can order...well, I say unto those people, YOU CRAY.  I LOVE Korean BBQ because of this very reason.   After a stellar performance by my little goddaughter at her dance recital, our little famished group decided to go pig out on some delicious grilled meats. When we got there, there were only two other groups there but as soon as we started ordering, the place filled up quickly. There was only one server and she looked like she was going to pass out from the pressure of serving 8 tables in this very very hot restaurant. She was running around like crazy and didn't remember anything we had originally ordered. FINALLY she called someone from the back to come and help her and things started running a little more smoothly.  The food is definitely on point.  The meats all tasted great and I loved all the sides.  The bulgogi was lean and perfectly marinated, unlike some other places where you get an occasional fatty bite, which is disgusting.  The Pork Belly was sooooo good and one of my favorites. Next time, I'd like to try the spicy pork as that is always one of my favorites at all Korean BBQ places.  At the end of your meal, they make fried rice for you on the grill, which I find to be incredibly strange because at this point, if you're not stuffed into food-coma status, then you're just a giant fatty who should stay away from AYCE anything...*Ahem Jenny D.*   Overall it was really good. I wish the service had been better, but the food is worth it!  For $16 AYCE, there really isn't a lot of room to complain.",

The only problems that I really have is that the service is SUPER SLOW like we ate here last night and we didn't get finished with our food until like 6-7 am when we got there at like 3-4. The lady was supposed to adjust our temp and flip our meat for us but most of our brisket burned and we had to try to eat it quickly before the other half burned. Oh to also add they don't give you rice , you Have to add it which I think sucks because who normally just eats Korean meat without the rice ?! And then we asked for hot tea and never got it . We ordered and got all our food before we even got our beverages! There were only 3-4 other tables eating too but she spent the least time tending to our table. Then last she never even brings out our bean paste soup that goes with the combo, we had to request it when it was time to pay the bill. We asked for the bill she didn't even give it to us for another 30 mins. We finally left when the sun was coming up and we come out to our car with a flat tire. Great. What a wonderful night. anyways 2 stars for the terrible service but also 2 stars because they're still reliable for night owls",

    "text": "UPDATE: 8/16/2010: I went there again this past weekend and just a side note on the fried rice served at the end.  The first time I went, I had a friend who was Korean and I think we got the rice complimentary because of him. But this time, we had no-one with us that was Korean (or who spoke Korean), so I had to ask for the rice at the end of the meal. I think it is an additional cost, but well worth it. Remember to leave some room at the last for the rice!  -----------------------------  Korean BBQ...   When I say that I think of the open grill and cooking all the meat I can. But Honey Pig is different.   Honey pig gives you this large pot that looks like an inverted wok sitting over a wok style gas burner. What happens at this BBQ house is that the meat is cooked on this \"dome\".  We just ordered the \"all you can eat\" choice, I think it was $20 per person (or maybe $25) I can't remember. You can also eat ala carte and they have a bunch of other menu choices.  The AYCE choice starts you off with with kim chee dishes and kim chee and sprouts on the \"grill\" then the meat comes. We had pork and beef. Oh, they also give you a salad type item, but that is best used for a base to eat the grilled meat...  You cook the beef and eat up, use the \"salad\", kim chee and sprouts as a base to eat with your meat selections and go to town! After you are almost full, tell the wait staff you are done.  They will then bring some rice over and put it on the grill, anything left on the grill gets' mixed up in the rice and cooked. Leave the rice on the grill until it cooks up and gets a good crust on the bottom. I equate this to the burnt rice chinese grandma's make.   Once the rice is ready, just eat up and fill your belly the rest of the way up. I think in hindside, we'd have ordered a little more meat and get it grilling before asking for the rice. (giving the rice more meat)... hee hee...  Grilling the food this way still produces smoke, but not as much smoke as other Korean BBQ places you're used to going to...  If you plan on going to this place before going out, don't wear your clubbing wear here. go back home and change. But if you're just going back to the smokey casinos, then come as you are.  Enjoy!",

[the only bad things was - this family came in with their baby and their kid, and the second the kid walked in he wouldnt stop screaming!!! a couple who came in after the family did sat, and they were clearly regulars because all the servers went to say hello, but minutes later, they left. even the servers went over to stop the kid from screaming, but he wouldnt stop!]  note: has anyone tried the pork neck? sounded interesting, but we were so full!!!",

So he gave me two of his favorite places to try that don't use MSG. His #1 recommendation was Honey Pig BBQ. A few nights later, we went for dinner and wow! What flavorful food at really good price. For $21.95 each, we had the AYCE BBQ. We ate so well and we also got the kimchi jigae soup. Top notch food. I don't know what is the fuss with the complaints about their service. Every table was well serviced when we went. They were attentive and nice. Don't let those reviews stop you from trying this place out. It is a gem. I am super thankful I lucked out and got in to a taxi with a Korean driver. I scored! Oh and I should note that I travel a lot for my work and I make a point of finding good Korean food in every city, big or small. Trust me, this place is awesome!",

Pork Neck and Belly is good, but we felt like we been screw over with the beef sirloin and short rib. It was suppose to be 1 order each, but we got 3 piece of short rib with 4 people. The sirloin was so little we probably have 2 piece each. I thought that was 1 or 2 orders but end up that's what they are going to give us with 4 people.  The soju are expensive over  $12 a bottle. No Steam Egg or bean paste soup, only sprout soup. The quality of salad is worst I have in Korean BBQ  I only 1 word to describe them. CHEAP~   If you ever eat Korean BBQ at K-town in LA. You will go to this place. I wonder if it's just because we're not Korean.",

One meat dish was enough for 2 & was splendidly tasty & whatever the 2 of us didn't eat, I took home for the next few days.  They also serve you a family style salad, the small plates of pickles, lots of beansprouts & kim chi on the grill.  I declined the rice since it's too much carb stuff.   At that late time, they were about 65% occupied with sev'l large groups, some family, others friends.  The male waiter did seem absent minded & had no name tag.  (He who shall go nameless).",

I should have said something when the lady covered up our cooking table, but some places will cook up the meat in the kitchen and present it all cooked and ready to go, not this time, it came out soupy. The banchan (side dishes) were old and sour! Now maybe they can get away with presenting old over ripe side dished to someone who doesn't know better, but what a poor example to give to someone that knows better. Maybe a off day, but I will never go back. Service was not that thoughtful, just drop and go. There was just my table and another one in the corner, and you could tell there were others there before us because you could see all the old BBQ tables sitting around with old food laying around with no one cleaning up the mess. Yeeeech! a bad example of Korean cooking.",

Hence the name \"Honey Pig.\" So, if for whatever reason, you can't part-take in pork or pork by products, this is not the place for you.   But for the rest of us who can! Talk about a nice change of pace in terms of the \"other\" white meat! Pork  at times is given such a bad name in terms of being called unhealthy, fatty, swine, and etc. It was really nice to see a place that specialized it this forgotten meat.   The meat was pretty good! All of it was nicely seasoned and a nice variety given. There was thinly sliced pork belly, marinated pork short ribs, marinated pork rib eye, and beef short ribs/kali be. The side dishes/Ban-chans' were pretty good, with the most flavor going to the traditional kim chee and the spicy cucumber dish. And just like a traditional Korean BBQ joint, a mixed vegetable bi bim bop is made for you at the end of the meat course. ummm... goes perfectly with some So Ju!  Enjoy",

She cooked the meat for us and also the kimchee and bean sprouts.  Pork Belly - excellent ordered a 2nd servings Teriyaki Chicken- ok, nothing special didn't taste like teriyaki beef ribs- good   Next order: Soup- good broth, didn't serve it to us until after we ate our first                portion. Marinated beef- good flavor Spicy pork- good taste like Filipino tocino Fried Rice- ok cooked at the end of the meal, we should have ordered it earlier.   Korean Ice tea was really good but they didn't serve it to us until after we asked for a water refill.  Service got slow after they became busy, they only had 2 waitresses.

    "text": "Save your money, do your appetite a favor and go down the street to Sura BBQ or Tofu Hut for your Korean BBQ needs. The prices there are over the top expensive, but worse of all.. THE SERVICE IS HORRIBLE!  If you HAVE to go to Honey Pig to eat..  go ahead and do it because whenever someone tells you  not to touch the hot stove-- you have to do it anyways. But just remember when you're paying for the bill and calculating how much tip you should leave.. \"I told you so!\"   When I came in with my cousins 3 days ago, there were 4 Korean girls working the front.  We asked for a table and sat down, checking out the menus.. but as soon as we sat down and looked around, my 2 cousins and I all noticed that 3 of the 4 girls standing at the counter were whispering to each other and kept glancing over at our table They were laughing and staring, making it VERY obvious they were whispering some crap about us. I ended up making eye contact with them and one of the girls didn't even bother to look away. She stared at me for a few seconds and then turned her head to finish working.. but the whole night she didn't bother to come over to check up on us. This happened a few more times during the night. They would not stop whispering and laughing and then glancing over to us every time we asked for a refill, or some food item! It was horrible, we felt so disrespected. Coincidentally, the  restaurant got busy about 30 minutes later.. with tables that were majority groups of men coming to dine and drink beer.  There had to have been about 7 tables with groups of men, and we were the ONLY table there with 3 girls. The whole time we were there, only 1 girl had the decency to come over and check up on us without us calling for them, while all of them would constantly check back and forth to all of the tables with the men. I'm not trying to be judgmental, but I swear it was so obvious that they were trying to please the other people (for more tips probably). The whole experience was unprofessional, and downright disrespectful for us.  On top of bad service, as far as their menus.. it was ridiculously overpriced! Now, I am a really big food adventurer and work in a 5 star Japanese restaurant.. so when it comes to spending a lot of money on food, I'm not unfamiliar with. I don't mind as long as its good quality, or exotic. AND as far as Korean BBQ, I am a huge fan of therefore I have tried all Korean BBQ restaurants I know in Vegas. Honey Pig's all you can eat is $20 (which in the beginning, I thought was decent) .. BUT everything else was over $25 for a plate! Their single plate BBQ (just raw meat) started off at $25 for simple brisket.. Every other type of meat, including even pork belly was $25 and more!  My cousins and I ended up getting the all you can eat, which was $60 + tax for 3 people. The meat was alright nothing different from the other Korean restaurants..but the thing that bothered us the most was how the waitresses portioned our servings. We had each ordered different items on the all you can eat list.. and when we told her to bring out a plate of everything so we can try each.. SHE LOOKED AT US LIKE WE WERE CRAZY. I mean, wtf? We're paying $60 for all you can eat! In the end, she DIDN'T bring us all of the plates, only the first 4 things we asked for.. and on top of that, the portions got smaller and smaller as we ordered more. It was unbelievable. It got to the point where my cousin didn't even want to ask for more food because the girl had come back about 4 times already. They were being so cheap with their all you can eat. They assumed  that we were 3 girls, therefore we shouldn't have be getting the same amount as a table full of men. There was no rice either, so none of us got really full.  Overall, I DO NOT recommend this place if you're looking for quality Korean BBQ. It has nothing special. Like Tofu Hut (there AYCE is only $14), or even Korean BBQ in the Chinatown plaza (which is more expensive than Tofu Hut).. it's the same type of meat and style of cooking..   The service at  Honey Pig is absolutely disgusting. Even if you don't like AYCE, their combination dishes are ranged from $40 for 2 people and increase a good $30 after that for 3 and so on ... You're still spending an average of $25 there regardless. And for bad service too. I STRONGLY don't recommend.",

I noticed most of the bad reviews were for larger groups - there were 6 in our party, but again who cares about excuses. Maybe we should've known not to go since it was a Friday night and only 2 tables were taken out of probably 15. But the name is so cute and it had generally good reviews on yelp. So we went, had some overpriced $12 soju (retail $3) and everyone got all you can eat. The guy wouldn't let me start w kalbi and spicy pork - said no do the brisket because it cooks faster. That wasn't a suggestion he wouldn't let me start with what I wanted. They brought out the sides,like 4 things - more regular kim chee, radish, some kind of fermented fish and these cute little pancakes. The selection sucked I asked for cucumber kim chee she said we don't have that, soy sauce potatoes \"we don't have that\", more of the pancakes pls \"you only get one\" WTF!  Brisket is done and they bring out another pile of kim chee and bean sprouts to cook. Its pretty obvious they were trying to fill us up with the cheap sh*t. They brought out kalbi finally when it was done we asked for more and we were told it was 1 order per person, which it does say in the menu. I told him no there are 6 ppl and the amnt you brought out was serving for 2 or 3. I didnt say it but F*ck that. He went to the back and brought out more. Yay.... I asked for shik-hye for the end of the meal \"we don't have that\". Everyone on yelp said the best part was the fried rice they make on your grill. I was looking forward to this light at the end of a craptastic tunnel. The kim chee fried rice was ok, nothing special. We got the bill which wasn't itemized just a bunch of prices and a total, so we asked what everything was.  Those mofos charged us $4.95 x2 for that fried rice! Maybe this goes back to the not being Korean issue but I never saw a charge mentioned in any other reviews.  We paid and left w out leaving a tip. Not something any of us normally do, but that really was the worst dining experience I've ever had. I almost hoped they would come running out asking about a tip like I've read in other bad reviews on this place.  My suggestion - don't bother w honey pig! Go to woo che its in the same shopping center right off of spring mtn, its where we normally go for Korean bbq. Its cheaper, has other prepared food included, you pick what meat you want and cook what you want when you want it. Service is also very nice. This is what I get for trying something new",

    "text": "I've been looking for AUTHENTIC Korean food ever since I arrived in Las Vegas three years ago....the other night I found it.  I was sitting in my living room drinking Vodka and watching Anthony Bourdain travel to Seoul. He ended up in a barbecue pork restaurant and I got crazy watching.   I've lived and worked in South Korea for since 1971 and sometimes I NEED some Korean food. So anyway, there was Bourdain drinking SoJu and eating pork and I just had to have some. It was about 12:30 am and I stumbled into Honey Pig. I left about an hour later a very happy guy.  Honey Pig is authentic as it gets. So many Korean \"barbecue\"  restaurants in the US \"westernize\" their food that I'm often disappointed. There's great Korean in LA and NY but here in Vegas you never know what you're going to get.  Give me pork or beef on a hot grill, Chi-ge and SoJu and I'm happy, happy, happy. When the food and atmosphere remind me of some of the wonderful late night places I've enjoyed over the years in Seoul and I'm ecstatic.   I went back to Honey Pig today for lunch just to make sure I wasn't too drunk to really judge last time. I wasn't mistaken. The Nang Myun (cold noodles in broth) and Kalbi were delicious.  If you're in Vegas and hungering for Korean food anytime of the day or night (they are open 24 hours a day) don't hesitate to try Honey Pig.",

They just kept feeding us beansprouts and kimchee thaty was cooked on the grill and then in between gave us our meat dishes.  They seemed to be trying to fill us up with more and more cooked kimchee,  FInally we said that we didnt come here for the kimchee but came here for meat.

    "text": "Well my girlfriend and I came here for dinner one night because she had told me that this place was amazing for the price. I have never been to a Korean BBQ place before, and from what I heard from the girlfriend and many of my asian friends, this place was the place to be at.  When we walked in, it was fairly quiet. Many other patrons were quietly eating their food. It looked like Honey Pig was airing out the restaurant by opening all the doors and windows, and having the vents on full power. Honestly it sounded like a factory or something haha. No biggie though, I'm there for the nitrosamine foods, not the noise.  My girlfriend and I got the AYCE, which included several different meats. In my opinion, everything tasted great, but I especially enjoyed the bulgogi and the Sirloin. The Ribs were delicious as well! There was squid included, but honestly I don't like the texture of squid. My girlfriend said it was good though, so there's my review on that haha.  I was very impressed with the attentiveness of our waitress. She came by often to help us grill and also bring more meat out. Although there were times where she looked like she had too many people to manage, she never forgot any request that we had.  That cinnamon drink at the end tho!!! I think I wanted to take a gallon home! Haha! Overall this place was great for the price. Would I come back? Yeah probably... I hear there are many great Korean BBQ places in Vegas so maybe I'll check all of them out also.",

    "text": "\"Hey, Sandy, so the other day I was at --\" \"Stop talking! There's not enough time! The meat is cooking faster than we can pull it off the grill! HUSTLE!\"   Whenever people are trying out KBBQ for the first time, they always make the same observation: \"So you're telling me I am paying money to cook for myself AND serve myself?\" You are, indeed!   The thing about Honey Pig is that the servers will actually place the meat on the grill for you, but the actual cooking is up to you. So if you are two people like we were in the conversation above, it doesn't leave too much time for conversation because you are too busy cooking, chewing, timing, grabbing, flipping, drinking, etc. Notice how \"waiting\" is not one of the above? AIN'T NOBODY GOT TIME FOR THAT. Since the servers are putting the meat (+ kimchi, bean sprouts, and onions) on the grill for you, there's not a lot of freedom to pace the cooking process.   My friend and I opted for AYCE, so each round just seemed rushed. The only time anything was NOT was in the beginning, when we asked for water - they said OK, and then forgot - and at the end, when we asked for the check - they said OK, and then forgot. Hmm. So perhaps not the best first and last impression.",

Parking is easy because it's in the Big Lots shopping plaza. Lot's of tables for a small restaurant and each table is reasonably spaced from each other. No bumping chairs with your neighbor.   Service is great, especially if you're one of only a few tables seated. They give LOTS of food! Between the 4 of us, we were really full with the #2 (comes with either soju or a beer). They also cook the food for you and our server was very attentive to our food. Also, they do not change out the grill, instead clean it, so you don't have to wait for the new grill to heat up to cook the rest of your food. The grill is also very big, so you can cook lots of food at once and not have to wait for more food to cook. Our server also turned on the vent, something that Sura didn't do for us when when I went there for my cousins.   I like the quality of the meat. It all tastes so very good. The pork belly is my favorite. Not too much fat but enough to give it that pork belly flavor. Beef was very tasty as well, all seemed fresh. And that fried rice at the end!! Save room for the rice! And save some meat to mix with the rice at the end too.   I will DEFINITELY come back here again!",

I asked again, where's my other meats? 15 minutes of waiting and finally she brought another one (yes, they brought one by one). By the time the fourth meat arrived, the grill already burnt.   So I asked for the grill to be replaced. The server totally ignored my first request.  I asked again, and this time with a different server to have the grill replaced. She told us rudely that we should order meat without sauce first next time. I explained nicely that I ordered 4 meats right away, and I expected to cook the one without the sauce one first. But unfortunately, the one the other server brought was the one with the sauce first. I had no choice but to cook the one with the sauce first.  Each of the plate we ordered has a very small portion. For example, the short ribs we ordered, it only came with 2 pieces. And if you need to ask another plate, it will take another 10-15 minutes.   They also helped cooking the meat for us with the tong that they use for both raw and cooked food. Cross contamination everywhere. Oh, and the potato appetizer I requested, never arrived..   I wouldn't go back ever..",

The AYCE is a little spendier than similarly priced places, but the superior cuts of meat more than made up for it. They have all our groups perennial favorites, including beef tongue, so everyone in our group was happy.   They were packed, and packed with big groups on the night we were there. And everyone we saw looked like they were having a blast. We certainly were.  Pros; - Great food at a very affordable price.  - Great for groups up to 8.  - So much Kimchi. So much warmed, delicious kimchi. I'll take a bucket, please. - Tons of sides  Cons; - Can get packed, and when they get packed, service starts to slow down.  - Can be a little bit hard to find your first time. It's in the back corner of the little strip mall. Look for that happy pig.",

    "text": "I thought the lunch was $17.99 but during the weekend it is all day dinner price for $24.99 per person.  The only difference between dinner and buffet is that you get only one order of short ribs and one or two other item.  That is a rip.  This is not a self serve buffet, where you get you own meat.  You have to actually order from the waitress and they get it and cook it in front of you. The problem is sometimes you want more of one item than another.  The items they have are very limited.  The reason why I gave two stars is because they only give you two small bowls of rice for an all you can eat .  Also I am Asian.  Just like most Asians, I eat a lot of rice, especially with all you can eat meat buffet. I don't know of any Asian culture where you get more meat than rice. After I requested a second bowl of rice the waitress actually warned me that she will have to charge me for an extra bowl.  What the What. And this is a SMALL bowl of rice. it is less than 8 ounces. How can you eat hot and spicy foods with out rice.  This might be worth it for $12.99 but not for $17.99 or $24.99. It is not worth it. I hate going to a restaurant and feeling ripped off and I felt ripped off here.",

This was the next closest one and when we arrived we were considering leaving because the parking lot seemed empty and there was maybe only 3 tables here. We assumed the food must not be that great but we were tired and just wanted to eat something so we stocked around. Boy were we glad.  We got their famous honeycomb pork Belly and I'm not an avid meat eater so we only ordered one order but it was more than enough for us mainly due the husband eat the meat and I ate the side dishes! One order comes with about two slabs of pork belly (super thick slabs), 5 side dishes, salad, and grilled kimchi and bean sprout. At the end with your leftover they make fried rice on the stovetop/grill.   Even though this place is not an ayce bbq the meat quality is better. So basically you pay for the meat. The atmosphere is quiet too",

We tried talking to the server, but all she could say was \"read the rules\", which she obviously did not understand since they were in English.  Also, they had water cups upside down on saucers at the tables, and mine was about 1/4 full of liquid when I grabbed the cup, hopefully it was water.  The table area around the round BBQ was very small and absolutely everything was covered in a film of grease.  I rarely do harsh reviews, but no thanks on this one.",

When I was close to touching the tongs to move around some meat, the server said it was okay she got it and she proceeded to do most of the cooking. However, I assumed she would do all of the cooking since she stopped me from moving around the meat initially.

They charged extra on top of the $25 for soup ($5) egg or the other items that most AYCE comes with. Also they only let you order 3 items 1 time...

This included (per order) soup, a soda pitcher, brisket, bulgogi, pork belly and neck, and steak. The selection was decent. I was very disappointed when they offered the fried rice special, basically mixing fried rice with left over kimchee and bean sprouts, at the very end, when all the meat was gone. Note to self and others, ask for that up front. The service was great. Our server definitely earned his gratuity and was around frequent to check on the cooking, was quick with request, and very polite. I enjoyed This Korean BBQ, but I'm unsure if I'll come back.

It does not matter if they are busy or slow.   Their food makes up for everything else. Their pork belly is very good! Probably my favorite out of all the spots I've tried in town.

We found out later as we wanted to get more meat, and this was during dinner on a Wednesday night, the place was only two thirds full at most throughout the night.  Our first clue should have been to leave when we found out they didn't have chicken on the menu, but then they agreed to substitute the squid in the combo for chicken, so we decided to stay - big mistake.  If you have kids that only eat chicken, it is not enough meat for what they provide you.  They did come over and help us cook, and they did refill our Korean style ice tea.  But when the bill came, a $69.99 combination quickly turned into $99.47, and we only had 1 beer.  Turns out they had added gratuity already, but we were just 3 adults plus 2 kids under age 5.  We had to ask for more salad as the bowl was rather small for our table.    Such a huge disappointment for a nice promising name like Honey Pig.

Are you effing kidding me??? Sure, it isn't as fun as saying you're going to \"pho kim long\" after the club but, whatevers....you just spend $$$ at the club and you're hungry....this is a good place to save some money and eat your drunken little heart out on KBBQ.  You feel fat, bloated, and hungover in the morning but, isn't that what Vegas is really about? YES, it is. Thank you!",

We ended up give $5 more for forever-parting gift.  Like I said, there was six of us. Only one pitcher of water/tea was on the table. Every time we begged for more water they will give us a pitcher full of ice. You have to be careful every time you pour or you will have ice spilled all over the table and your shirt, and at one point I have to get up and get water myself.  Another thing about this place is they are so understaffed, and they want to give a half-ass \"full service\". The servers tried to cook the food for us and we always ended up a full grill of vegetables with minimum amount of \"meat\". I thought this is a BBQ place, not a vegetarian eatery.  I strongly suggest if you want to be treated like a sucker and be served tasteless food, vegetarian if I might add, and wait 20 minutes for everything. please go give this place a try.",

If it's slow enough the staff stops by and cooks your meat for you while explaining what sauce to use for what meat. Their kim chee is very fresh and tasty. Becky was our waitress and she was very friendly and helpful whenever we had questions regarding the food. Being from Hawaii we have a lot of Korean BBQ but none with the type of pot stove that Honey Pig has. So instead of your regular yakuniku grill Honey Pig, has a oval shape stone type grill that resembles a top cover to a pot. Lol nothing was wrong from what I could see. This place has an all you can eat menu certain times through out the day and their regular menu is pretty affordable too. Another plus is that they're open 24 hours a day.. This place is a must whenever in Vegas..",

The fried rice at the end is THE BEST, if you have room for it. We got the #2 set for 3 people and we were stuffed. I've been to the locations in LA and I will say the ones in LA are a little bit more well kept, but the food is still the same, good. Great for korean bbq beginners and great for groups.

It was very authentic, where I couldn't really read anything on the menu. My friend, a Vegas local, ordered for us. I know we got some type of brisket and veggies. The sides included your typical KBBQ sides and a bowl of salad. The meal came with rice, which was cooked at the end, but it didn't matter cause we tore that up, regardless. I enjoyed the tea that they served in the beginning, too. I thought it was dirty water, but it was tea, so don't be scared to drink it.  The thing that impressed me most was that our waitress actually cooked our meal for us. I haven't read any of the reviews for this place so I'm not sure if this was typical but maybe cause it was dead at like 3am? I don't know, either way it was good, drunk food. I'm sure it tastes even better when you're not intoxicated.",

    "text": "Ok, first off, I heard of this place coz of my food buddy. He took one of his dates to this place and he said it was pretty good. So decided to check it out.   First impression, it's on the corner of the big lots shopping center. No biggie. Going in, I see that even though it's a respectable amount of diners esting, there's only 3 people working the floor. One if bussing the tables, 2 are actively serving the tables. Mind you, these 2 active servers have to help at least 7 tables each. 1 for each side of the restaurant. One server for potentially 10 tables each just means that their attention for each table is very minimal. At the time, there's only 7 tables active, but they would only be on the table for maximum of 1 minute each. There is also a language barrier with the servers, but it's ok. They made it up with friendliness. We waited to be seated for at least 10 minutes, that should not be a situation, but we walked in at the very same time as another couple and as soon as they walked in, they got seated...but not us even though they have open tables available. Also, when I ordered extra rice, I eat a lot of rice, I had to remind them about it. When it arrive, it wasn't warm but was still ok to eat.   Now onto the food itself. The meat was great especially the brisket and bulgogi. Everything else was a little too fatty, even for my taste. I've been known in my family and friends to be th e person to eat the fattiest steak. Some people would even call the steak that I like to be heart attack steak. But the meat that was serve was too fatty. I'm gonna need to workout a little extra coz of it. But, it was still good. I've been to another AYCE korean bbq, but in California,  and I'd do the one in California before I'd do this one again.   Overall, I'd give this place a 3 out of 5. Would I come back again? Maybe. Would I suggest this place to my friends? Yes, if they want to go to an AYCE. Would I suggest this place over the other places I've eaten in the area? I'd probably suggest other places in the area first before I would suggest honey pig. Only because it didn't give me the feeling of wanting to go back to this place. If I really want AYCE meat, I'd go to Swish over on Sahara. One other good thing about this place is that they are open 24 hours. Just thought I'd point that out, just in case anyone would be looking for a Korean bbq place at 4am.  This place can improve so much with just a few things. One of them would be hiring more people to accommodate the volume of clients. I get that budget might not be up to par, but in my experience, I've seen a whole different level of customer satisfaction just because the establishment hired more workers to make people happy. More workers would mean that orders wouldn't be forgotten, more time interacting with customers instead of rushing through customers, and increased volume of customers since they can accommodate them.",

They get quite busy when there is a convention in town or on the weekends, and they don't offer AYCE during peak times (unless they just don't offer the menus to the guests...). I personally love their honeycomb pork belly, which is basically a THICK slab of bacon, and their beef brisket. Their kimchi and bean sprouts are bombbbb since they put it on the grill. Speaking of the grill, it's a giant round lid looking thing, so table space is a bit tight. It also tends to get extremely hot, but they have fans scattered around to try to relieve the guests, but just make sure you don't sit on the receiving end of all of the smoke that gets blown by the fans! Oh, and they should offer making fried rice out of the leftover meat and kimchi, but if they don't, definitely ask your server!   Service is inconsistent since there usually aren't enough employees for the amount of customers, but there is a service button on every table which you should definitely take advantage of because a server will be at your table almost instantly.   If you can overlook the spotty service and the slightly high prices, this is a fantastic, authentic Korean restaurant.",

Anyway, the combo meals are on the high side but pretty generous for the amount of food you get. Basically, you cook your food on the grill on your table. The veggies, noodles, meat, etc. comes out one by one. One thing I did NOT like at all is that we had to eat our meals without rice because the server said we can only have rice at the end.  Excuse me, huh? What? I'm Asian. I need my rice with my meal. I don't eat rice after. I eat rice during. She was also in control of what gets cooked, how it's cooked, etc. We asked things multiple times because she kept forgetting or she was just by herself and didn't have time to everything at once. I understood and did not complain. Actually felt bad for her.   Ugh, I dont know if I'll ever be back. If I'm craving Korean BBQ, I'll just go to Sura.

It was 10 o'clock on a Saturday night & there were probably only about five other people in the restaurant. It's a cute little korean restaurant that reminded me a lot of the korean bbq restaurants I see on korean dramas. We decided to do all-you-can-eat KBBQ for $26.95 per person which we thought was a little pricey especially since there's not much on their AYCE menu.   Their service here is spectacular, but then again we came in when there were literally five other people in the restaurant. They help cook the food for you which my husband liked cos he was a bit buzzed and not wanting to do any of the grilling, lol.   However, I can't say the same for their meat. It wasn't tender as I'd like it to be. I've been to plenty of AYCE KBBQ places in Vegas & I've had better quality meat. Their kimchi was okay too. Again, I've had better. What I did like was their soybean paste soup! It wasn't too salty or too watery which is a common mistake that other KBBQ places make with their soup.   I can't say if I would come again here to dine because of the price, variety of meat selections on their menu, and the quality. It just wasn't worth it for us. Maybe we'll try their non-AYCE menu next time. Sadly, this is a miss for us.",

After we sat down and ordered we were informed that because it was the weekend that we would be paying the \"all day price\" instead of the $17.95 price that was on the lunch menu so now lunch was going to cost $26.95 but it was 1:00 pm. After we were done eating the check came and we were charged $30.85 per adult, that price is no where on the menu. And it is hard to complain due to the language barrier.",

The grilling area is quite unique, and allows you to grill a ton of food at one time without having to change the grill!   We ordered a whole bunch of assorted meats, but my favorite had to be the brisket. Typically I like marinated meats, but I wasn't feeling it. The food is overall just average in my opinion. Might have been due to the hype that I was expecting something insanely good, but I wasn't blown away. Some of the meat tasted a little off such as the short ribs... a few of us felt a tad bit of food poisoning the next day as well. We definitely cooked the meat to completion before eating it too.   The place is def overpriced for what it is. The service is good though, and the place is clean, and has great AC. Probably wouldn't go again to be honest.",

We got the pork combo A, which comes with beef brisket, pork belly, soup and fried rice at the end. By the time when we were finished with the meat part, we were waiting for the server to make the fried rice for us. But- no. I noticed other tables who were before us also had finished their meat, but I did not see any fried rice made for them.   The server seemed very overwhelming, I mean, I understand you being busy but he kept ignoring us. He did not even bring us the soup. So we gave up on it because other people did not get theirs either. Yes, we gave up. So basically, we paid 55 dollars for very little portion of the beef brisket, pork belly, and some side dishes. HOW RIDICULOUS!!!!!!!! I think our server purposely ignored to serve us the soup and make the fried rice for us. I felt so sorry for all the people who were there. This is my last straw and I'm not going back!!!",

That's okay, though, not too bummed about that since there are things you can order that isn't on the lunch menu.    Next came the ordering.  We sampled everything on the menu.  Overall I think the meats are less marinated.  I like heavily marinated flavors in meats.  On a scale rating for tasty meats, If hobak is a 9, then tofu hut a 6, then this place is a 5.  Cleanliness this place is better than tofu hut on par with hobak, but I'm here for the taste.    The complimentary kimchi was marginal at best.  Only unique one was the seaweed.  The salad dressing was nice and sweet.  The rest is just common.    Final bill came to be 60 ish which is average for Korean bbq.    If I'm craving for good kbque, I would go to hobak.  If I'm craving for value, tofu hut.  Not sure if I would come back here.",

They looked at me and my friend like we were insane when we ordered a soju AND beer.  They never brought the beer because that was just too much alcohol for two skinny white girls I guess.  Also, never order wine here...not sure what I was thinking...it tasted like pickle juice.  Stick with the Hite.  Anyhow, so me and my earlier mentioned skinny white drinking buddy went in here one eve with our gorgeous husbands and the ladies were totally nice to us, so the guys didn't believe our stories of rude waitresses.  Needless to say, I am a glutton for punishment, as long as the food is delicious.  I don't care about having good service as long as the food is cheap and great.

I have to say, there wasn't that many side dishes served like I read in Teri C's review.  The sangchu and pa (green onion and lettuce salad) had too much green onion in it.  It sort of wanted to make my eyes tear up.  The sam gyup sal (three layered pork, resembles a huge bacon) and this type of kalbi sal (the kalbi with the bone at the end) tasted really good.  They insisted that we eat the kalbi first though then the fried rice (actually it's fried bibim bbap) which we didn't understand.  Should be able to eat it at the same time if you wanted.  Well they cook it on a brazier.  They also serve beer here.  Plenty of room, and overall I was satisfied.",

The server argued that seafood is better than beef or pork, but I will have to disagree with on that point since shrimp are not peeled in Korean style dishes (Honey Pig is no exception) and there is little other meat in seafood.  The taste of the actual soup broth was good, the price was about $10, and the ban chahn was sufficient (not generous, but not completely lacking).  I actually wanted some kalbi, but it made little sense to shell out $23 for one person.  The menu really did not have any reasonably priced a la carte options.",

When you order the pork (bacon), they fry it up in front of you.  It's serviced with different vegetables and soup.  Then at the end, they use the same \"pan\" to fry up some rice.  I guess everything else was so good that the fried rice couldn't stand up.  But the soju made up for what the fried rice was lacking.    This place is good for late night munchies.",

Saw that Honey Pig is OPEN 24 hours so my family and I walked in, greeted, and seated. Service was great in the beginning. Ordered a COMBO which included a variety of meats which was delicious. Server brought drinks then our COMBO order and started to cook the meats one at a time. Then our server asked if we wanted steamed rice or fried rice. So we asked for fried rice. After 30 minutes, wondered what was taking the fried rice so long and the server told us that they cook the fried rice in front of us. Wish we knew that you get fried rice after the main course...DISAPPOINTING:( Usually, you would get your rice first along with main course.....NOT AFTER EVERYTING HAS ALREADY BEEN EATEN. What was more DISAPPOINTING was....what was inside the fried rice......RICE AND LETTUCE that was mixed in a bowl and they used left over kim chee. So our server cooked kim chee fried rice which I am not a FAN of. Don't get me wrong, I love Korean food but this was the first restaurant that served their rice LAST. FIRST and LAST for me!!",

SERVICE HERE SUCKS SOOOO BAD!!!!!. asked about AYCE which they advertise themselves on yelp. when we asked about it. they told us some BS excuse about how they dont have it because of convention time. wtf? isnt it always convention time in vegas? ok whatever we ordered a set meal and 2 other meats and it was all good. 10 min a group gets seated right next to us and we overhear them asking about ayce. the waiter gives them the same BS excuse but they complain and said they called to confirm and someone on the phone told them yes so the waiter brings them the ayce menu! wtf! i asked the waiter why they get it and not us and he said they called ahead and asked for it...basically more BS excuse. on top of that the waitresses who were suppose to cook our food for us did a poor job of ensuring our food wasn't overcooked and didn't really help to refill our drinks. bunch of liars and poor service means i wont be coming back here or would recommend anyone else to eat here. theres other places with better food and honest people. There's also a better honey pig in LA.  If you are Korean or speak Korean I think they would be nicer to you but we didn't and we got some shitty asssss service...unfair.... :(",

    "text": "This review is based upon my first time to Honey Pig based upon recommendations from a number of Korean friends I have.  I opted for the \"all you can eat\" as it was a better deal (about $25.00 per person) than ala carte items from the regular menu.  I had to actually ask for the all you can eat menu, as they only gave me the regular menu, and did not offer the other one.  That being said, I do like the meat choices offered in the all you can eat menu. They offer the more common items such as bulgolgi and kalbi.  In addition, they offer sirloin, spicy pork belly, spicy squid, chicken and a few others.  I really enjoyed the kalbi (short ribs), sirloin, spicy pork, bulgolgi, and spicy squid.  Everything tasted really good in my opinion.  The one thing I didn't like, did not have to do with taste, but rather, with the fact that you could only order the sirloin and kalbi once, despite it being all you can eat.  I also did not like that you have to ask for rice, as they do not serve it with the meal.  On a smaller note, they also cook the kimchi and bean sprouts on the grill--probably just a taste thing, but I preferred those items cold.  The side dishes were fair, in my opinion.  I've had more variety and quantity in side dishes at other Korean bbq places.  I have read about bad service in other reviews, but I did not experience it here.  Although we had to flag our servers down a couple of times, she was prompt and pleasant with whatever we asked for.  I had also read about service being discriminatory if you are not Korean, but again, I didn't feel that way at all (I'm not Korean).  Overall, good, I would recommend others here.",

A few times after that, I would specifically ask actually how many soup does it come with, I ask other different server, everytime I ask, they say only one, but they serve two. That particular lady......... I really don't like, straight face, and the way she looks at me makes me feel very uncomfortable!",

A few times they let us substitute the pork with beef and YUM YUM. I think the pork is what they are known for, but it is such a fatty bacon. Once they no longer let us substitute it, we stopped coming here. We particularly like the sliced garlic with the bean paste to dip the meat in, and how they cook the kim chee and bean sprouts on the grill too. I love how they cook the fried rice at the end, it's so unique because I have never seen another place cook it this way. The fried rice is mixed with all the leftover meat so it gets extra good flavor. It comes to about $20-30 a person for a lot of food!",

One of our friend suggested that we give Honey Pig a try while the others wanted to go to a different place.  Upon arriving at the store the workers greeted us with a positive vibe, they then proceed to sit us down at table with a giant grill in front.  We ordered their number two which cost about 59.99 or so with a few beers and sodas.  However, even with only three of us eating the food was barely enough to make us full.  I was still very hungry when we asked for the bill.  The check came out to be almost 80 dollars between three people without including tip.  I don't mind paying money for food, but  somehow I feel a bit rip off with they price they charged us.  I understand that if it were dinner time then the price should be a bit on the hefty side.  With all that said and done I wouldn't recommend anyone to go to this place looking for a satisfy meal if you are not willing to shred out 30 or plus bucks.",

The food here is surprisingly good. its your typical korean bbq eatery. they give you raw meat, you cook the meant, then you eat the meat. being called honey big, of course they only have meat from the pig. the grill is like a big lid for an ancient jar. when the meat is cooking, they put the kimchi and other side dishes on the edge of the grill so you don't waste all the flavor. towards the end they add some rice and make fried rice. pretty interesting. it is a bit cramped in there and of course gets really hot in there. i believe you have to ask them for rice to do the whole fried rice thing, if not you don't get it. its like if you know they do it they'll do it but if not they won't waste time.",

We all left hungry... I digress. The meat was nothing special, in fact, it was worse than that, it completely lacked flavor. It must've been poor quality meat or they didn't use any type of seasoning on it at all. Whatever the case was, all 4 meats were pretty under whelming to say the least. The rice was probably the best part and I had to get up and ask for it (we were the only table, what the heck!) but it was late so I get it.

They specialize in pork (no surprise) and their signature feature is offering to cook a type of kimchi fried rice at the end using any of your left over ingredients.  Prices are pretty much as expected for Korean BBQ; quality is on par as is the customer service.  Best of all, for some reason this location is not as busy as the one in SoCal, probably due to it's location off the strip.  I would definitely come back, as it's a great place to get a great meal at a reasonable price off the strip.",

    "text": "We had one of our best meal here from this week! (first time to HP) We have been to probably more than 100 times to Korean AYCE restaurants. Here's my review:  Food: 4 stars - everything tasted so good. They give you sliced up kimchi and marinated bean sprouts to put over the cooking pan. They tasted so good once they were cooked. The meats were all tender and the marinate on the bulgogi was tasty too. What a great concept! Lunch was $15.95 per person (kids over 4 years of age too..). And I believe dinner is $19.95? (not sure).  Service: 5 stars - the lady that took care of us was so nice. She also gave my kids extra corn cheese on the house. She also gave us \"GaeJang\" on the house (marinated spicy raw crab). She made sure we have enough of everything and checked on us in a timely manner.  Ambiance: 4.5 stars - a great place to go with your family or friends. The location is little tricky to find for a first time patrons. There's another AYCE restaurant  in the same shopping center so don't get confused. Honey Pig is little deeper inside the shopping center on Spring Mountain Road in the center corner area.  I have been to numerous Korean AYCE in Los Angeles and Orange County. This is a good place to eat and you will not regret it. I will be back soon.",

This is actually the second time I've been to Korean BBQ but I will not count the first time. The first time I went with my friend, her husband and his friends. They were all pretty quick with the chop sticks so I ended up with one asparagus and a sliver of meat. It wasn't the ideal situation.   I was intimidated when I first came here because I read in different reviews that we may get ignored because we were not Korean. When we walked in they were very nice and attentive. They put a bunch of different items in front of us that you can use to enhance your meal. I didn't know what half of it was so I tried different things. The waitress cooked our meat (short Rib and Brisket )sprouts, and Kimchee for us.   They started us with some Seaweed soup which was a little salty for me . I tried mostly all of the items they put in front of me except for one thing I'm curious about. They looked like wet coffee beans I wanted to try them but didn't so I'll have to try it next time. The meat was really savory and delicious! I enjoyed eating it with steamed rice, the sprouts, and Kimchee. I also ordered some Korean fried rice which is a little different from Chinese fried rice. This fried rice had seaweed and it looked like pieces of romaine lettuce it was different but still good. In order to like this dish you have to appreciate the taste of seaweed.   The service was great because they really took care of us and made sure nothing was burning. They also understood that it was our first time so they made the experience delightful!",

The service here was rock-solid: the waitress actually cooked ALL of our meat and we didn't have to lift the tongs once! And at the end of the meal, the waitress fried kimchi and rice on the grill and we had that to eat as well.   Second time eating here was as delicious as the first although I was a little sad we didn't get the perks of someone cooking our food and we didn't get that kimchi rice dish at the end either.  We had a party of 9 and had to sit at 2 separate tables because they couldn't be moved. Ordered the same combo platter x2.  Meat quality is good. Waitstaff is nice.  nom nom love the potato side dish.  Would MOST DEF keep coming back here.",

I went there to treat my daughter as well because she well taken cared of me because i just got a hand surgery. Anyways the server SERAH belittled and insulted me when i ask to please give me water as my hand has just gotten into surgery she gave me a smirk and told me that it is not her responsibility to give me water and that i can pour it myself and she knows that i had a bandage in my right hand. I was so devastated I wasn't able to react right away. I called to ask for a manager and they said they have no idea when the manager will work. I don't recommend this place if the service is sooo bad",

There's a limit of 2 hours for the buffet which is fine but the fact that they take so long to bring out food it's as if you're paying for one meal and just sitting here for nothing. To top it all off, the rest of the waiters are sitting in the corner eating while they see us waiting for someone to bring out our food. This place is ridiculous.

It is $14.99 for lunch and $19.99 for dinner....HOWEVER, there is no lunch pricing for the weekend which we found out the hard way. We were already seated looking at the menu with our mouths watering and about to order from the lunch AYCE menu when the server said no lunch prices. OKAY then...we were there already and I had wanted some KBBQ. We decided to start with the Brisket, Sirloin, Pork Belly and Pork Shoulder. The meats all looked \"fresh,\" but my favorite was the brisket. I was a lil bit bummed that there was no potato salad, but that was that. The pork belly was ok, pork shoulder was tough to eat. The second round was with some more brisket and kalbi.  Kalbi was very flavorful and tender.  This AYCE meat galore for lunch was just a bit too much for me. I definitely think its worth the dinner price for dinner but not for lunch. Obviously, I favored the beef over the pork, but I definitely want to come back and eat some more....for dinner. Service was good, the lady didn't really speak English so that was a bit tough seeing how I don't speak Korean. It was nice that they helped cook everything too.",

My Mom was so impressed with the entire experience she felt compelled to literally tell everyone about the hungry pig, the cabbie, the bell hop, the dealer etc ...  I guess I can't blame her, we had a really great time and a really great meal! The service was outstanding (I guess we look like big tippers or out-of-towners) because the servers ordered and cooked our entire meal for us. Which was great because I did not want to explain bulgogi to my intoxicated parents and their friends.    The pork belly was exceptional, like imagine the best bacon ever and at 8p on a Saturday night, there was no wait at all. 5 stars all around for the hungry pig :)",

We were so stuffed that we couldn't try the rice but it looked and smelled delicious when they fried it on the cooktop after all the meats cooked. The seafood pancake could have been crispier.

A friend of mine told me that they had offered the rice paper thing with you're meat, and considering I just had the best Korean BBQ in Cali....this would satisfy the cravings.  But no, I was sort of disappointed.   Our group of friends did the all you can eat menu, which was $19.99 for dinner.  We got a serving of:  - Beef Tongue - which was good.  The meat was nice and tender when grilled, and it didn't shrink which was a good thing considering I got a big size.  - Spicy bugolgi - Hmmm, this I wouldn't go with.  It tasted like they just made it, and the spices are a little weird.  I think it's a little to spicy for my taste.  There's a difference between good spicy, and spicy, spicy.    - Kalbi (short ribs) - My gosh, this has been one of the best kalbi's I had out here for yakiniku in Vegas.  The marinade is quite delicious and it compliments the rice very well.  - Pork Neck - Hmmm, I thought ordering it would be interesting but the piece we got looked like a slice of pork chops. I was really disappointed with that.    - Pork belly - Always my favorite.  The slices were nice and thick, but kind of thin.  I think it tastes the same regardless of where you go.    - Sides - It came with some kind of anchovies and tofu, salad, spicy pickled cucumbers, and hot kimchi and bean sprouts.  I thought the idea of grilling the kimchi and bean sprouts were interesting, but unnecessary since I didn't even touch it.  Our group just kind of left it their to burn.   I did like the type of cooking grill the used rather than using gas grill, they used a pot lid to grill our food.  We didn't even have to as for a grill change.  I didn't like the fact that they gave us tea without the ice, it was more like a cup of tea that was sitting in a bottle for a while.  It was warm and tasteless.  I considered this like every other Korean BBQ, nothing seemed different.  The service is the same, and so is their food.  Nothing out of the ordinary, just a good place to hit since their hours are from 5pm to 8:30 am.    Check it out you might be surprised with their combo meals, I just thought the AYCE is the usual.  Maybe I might try the combo meals next time.  It might surprise me. But I still do like Tofu-hut better.",

BEWARE!!! when you order from this place make sure you get ALL your items. First, the waitress tried to give us the check not even giving us all our items we ordered. I confronted her kindly about it, and she got mad at us. She told us fine it will come out and yells in korean to the cook to make it. I say, if you are going to talk crap in Korean, make sure the customer your talking crap about isn't Korean. After she gives us our food that we ordered she gives me the bill. FAIL AGAIN! She over charged me and so when I confronted her about the bill, she asked me if I had a local ID? I didnt know that if I wasn't local, I would be charged more? I showed a local ID and she fixed the bill.   It gets better after this! She tells us to hurry and give her the check cause they are closing... UM.... I didn't know 24 hour places closed..... Maybe they should put the sign to say 23 hours or 22 hours?? And the front door clearly indicates that the place is 24 hours. So, Here comes the tip portion of my bill. First of all, I tip 20 percent if deserved. This ape of a waitress didn't deserve anything after being so rude to all of us. I was kind enough to tip 13 percent because we didn't believe that she deserved even 15 percent. Not only that, she was standing next to me the whole time watching me put the tip.  She saw how much tip we gave her, and she told me to give her more tip. I was in so much shock that I didn't know what to say! She told me that she wanted at least 18 percent considering that she served all of us plus she gave us a \"discount.\" I THINK NOT! i flat out told her that it wasn't a discount, its the menu price. You overcharged us and I asked to give us the right price, so technically thats not a discount. Oh and the place is a library atmosphere FYI. Apparently, we irritated her by talking too loud and to lower our voices. This is at midnight, and nobody is there except the waitress and a couple. What is more disturbing than ever was that after we ate, they thought that extra protein is a good thing, because we saw cockroaches on the floor as well.   It doesn't matter if you are Korean or not, they don't discriminate on horrible service. If you want horrible service and not all the food you ordered, and loved to be pressured into giving tip, Come to this place! I know we are in a recession and going through rough times, but this place takes the recession to a whole new level!!!",

I always ask for my white rice early on to compliment my meats. there's something about the rice they use at kbbq places and its stickiness! don't hate. they generally have the rice paper, but if the weather's warmer, they may not have it in stock. i'm a bit disappointed that they don't have some form of a potato salad here, but the sides aren't bad (although the number given isn't as generous as other kbbq places). they also have lettuce leaves and sliced radish if you don't care for rice and/or rice paper to compliment your meats. i'm not a meat expert by any means, but all i can say is that the quality and taste of their kbbq has never disappointed me from the times that i have been here. one other bonus is that they serve barley water here (unless you just want plain water) on the house, which i love!!",

Okay I'll quote you on that.\"  I went to Honey Pig on a Friday night with that picky bastard along with 10 other friends. Most of us are pretty accustomed to Korean Food but hadn't been to Honey Pig before.  Their grills were really neat because they were cone shaped so all the fat would be separated. We decided to do All You Can Eat for $20 so we can get a little taste of everything.   And taste EVERYTHING we did. We went down the menu like a checklist. We had the pork belly first and unanimously agreed on how tasty and fresh it was. Each meat they brought out after that tasted just as good or better. You could tell just by looking at the color of the meat that it was fresh. I especially enjoyed how they grill the bean sprouts and kimchee. Most of the banchan (side dishes) were good but I missed others that I had at other Korean BBQs such as steamed egg and soup.  Service was wonderful. Our waiter took the time to answer any questions we had and explain what everything was. Even with a huge group of 12, he cooked everything to perfection and made sure we always had enough banchan and drinks. They serve a rice flavored iced tea for free.  My picky friend pretty much tried and loved everything except for the squid (which he claims to be allergic to) and that in itself speaks volumes. I would gladly go back to Honey Pig again because everything was delicious and at a very good price.",

    "text": "We end up here -- in a little restaurant tucked into the corner of strip mall at Spring Mountain & Decatur -- on the suggestion of local food critic John Curtas, whose website <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eatinglv.com%2F&s=f4520e521968d1616076496340cf22ece2639290c25455f4ae8e7ca0bd29088d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">eatinglv.com</a> is a must-read for all Las Vegas area foodies.  The name of the place is \"Korean Honey Pig BBQ,\" which I find absolutely irresistible in a way that I'm sure I'm supposed to be ashamed about.  The 3 of us (Brother Juanito, Don & I) get seated at a small table, the middle of which is taken up by a \"panchan,\" which is essentially a large metal convex cooking surface with a small lip around its edge to keep the food from falling off. Again, following Mr. Curtas's excellent advice, we order the \"Honey Pig\" package for 3 (total price: $59.99), which comes with a bottle of \"soju,\" a drink which the waitress explains is \"Korean vodka\".  The waitress brings our bottle, turns a tableside knob to heat up our panchan, and, in the time it takes us to pour a round of soju, she starts to pile on the goodness.  Within minutes, slabs of beef and pork begin to sizzle as piles of kim-chi and bean-sprouts simmer & steam. Is there a better aroma than that of grilled meats? Small bowls of pickled cucumbers & seaweed, mushrooms, and some kind of slaw are brought as appetizers as we soak in a fragrant cloud of browning awesomeness. The waitress reappears, this time with a pair of tongs in one hand and a pair of scissors in another, and, in mere moments (the time it takes for us to swig another round of soju), our panchan is covered in goodness.  We tuck in with gusto. And the flavors are incredible. In a single chopstickful, I manage to wedge a chunk of hot, carmelized pork with a strand of spicy, vinegary kim-chi, and the contrast of flavors makes my tastebuds quiver with delight. Then I try a chunk of barbecued beef coupled with an al-dente-but-sweet piece of onion, followed by a wad of hot bean-sprouts. Again, the flavors are staggeringly pleasurable. Once my eyes roll back into place so I can focus them again, I take another swig of soju and keep eating.  Between the 3 of us (not one of whom weighs less than 200 pounds), the panchan is nearly cleared of food when the waitress brings yet more bounty: a pile of octopus that she expertly slices and places at the top-center of the panchan, warning us that \"it's not ready yet!\"  At this point, I am swooning with such paroxysms of gastronomic delight that I forget to snap a picture of this last protein course. It, too, smells amazing as it fries. When the waitress nods to us that it is ready to eat, the 3 of us devour it like rabid dogs. The chewy octopus had been wonderfully marinated so that it is perfectly complemented by just the right amount of acidic, biting chili sauce.  But that isn't the end of it! When the waitress (for purposes of this narration, I have conflated 3 or 4 different employees into a single character) notices that we are done with our mains, she turns off the heat and piles a mixture of rice and veggies onto the panchan for a final course -- a little something to stave off the meat comas we are in danger of succumbing to.  The rice sizzles slowly, and I remember more advice from the sagely John Curtas, which I will now quote from his excellent website:  \"If you're patient, the rice will attain that crispy, browned underside that the Spanish call soccarat (when it sticks to the paella pan). Tossed with whatever meat, vegetables or seafood are left on the pan, it becomes something like the ultimate fried rice.\"  I cannot stress enough the importance of following the advice of professionals. We do, and are duly rewarded. When the bill comes, it's for $59.99 and tax, a paltry sum for a meal that stuffed 3 fully-grown men and included a small bottle of vodka.  Then comes the surreal climax of the night. As we enjoy the last few bites of this last course of our meal, I turn around in my chair to survey the room. And who do I light upon? The one-and-only John Curtas HIMSELF, seated a couple of tables away, enjoying a meal with 2 guests.  We are awestruck, and, after settling up, as Don makes a quick pit-stop, Brother Juan & I approach Mr. Curtas and offer a thanks for the recommendation. He is gracious and very kind, even snapping a picture with us.  Thank you, Mr. Curtas, for the recommendation and the warm greeting when we interrupted your meal. Thank you, Korean Honey Pig BBQ, for the incredible culinary experience. We will be back.",

But yet another family came in after us and they were served right away with customer service! And when i finally got their attention, i told her that we havent been asked for drinks and when she asked me what i want, i told her and walked away pretty fast but she didnt bother asking the rest of the table what they wanted My sister in law asked for drinks for her daughter and it took them 20 mins to get it. They werent even busy!  The food was served fast and it was good,  But there was a point where my bf had meat on his plate, the waitress took the meat back because it wasnt ready!  I found it very rude. And we asked for rice but she said we couldnt have any, until we finish our food. I dont know if its because of our race or what, but their customer service was horrible!  I suggest going to another place!",

Suddenly, there was some trouble about the bill on another table. Sure sure I didn't mind about it. However, ONE server could deal about it instead of the ENTIRE staffs. I had work in 2 hours, and wanted to have a cute meal with my wife who happened to be at college all the time. Then take a nap together, you know. Then I had to wait for FORTY minutes for just a BOWL of cold noodle. I did not mind about it, but my wife stopped talking to me and started using her phone for silly games instead. No no, I already asked for a check. I ALREADY asked for a check of TWO. Yeah. 2 pork belly and 1 short ribs. 1 bowl of cold noodle and 1 check. For over  ONE and a HALF HOUR. 65 dollars flew away in vain. (No no no, they only had 3 tables, we came at 2 PM)",

We had kalbi (one of my fav things to eat), pork belly, and short ribs. But the best part of the night might have been this corn dish that our server made for us. It was corn, mayonnaise and maybe cheese? and it was f-ing fantastic. The servers were fantastic as well. I'm pretty helpless in the cooking department (even in making KBBQ!) and they came around and cleaned our grills, flipped our meats and made sure we had enough of everything. This was a great place for Korean BBQ. Definitely will come back!",

    "text": "I love Honey Pig.   I went there today with my boyfriend and my white/italian friend. (I wanted to see if they would treat us differently since I'm Korean but can't really speak Korean and people wrote so many reviews about them being rude to Non-Koreans).  All three of us got the All-You-Can-Eat for dinner. We had:  -Pork Belly (my fave) -Thin Sliced beef -Marinated Beef -Short Rib -Spicy Chicken -Spicy Octopus  The waitress was extremely nice although I was expecting the opposite.  She explained how to order the meat (From non-marinated to marinated) to get the best flavor out of everything we chose.  So we started with the pork and sliced beef since those aren't marinated.  The waitress gave us more service than I HAVE EVER SEEN in ANY other Korean restaurant.   (By the way, just because you're Korean doesn't mean they always respect you as one, I've had been treated terribly at several Korean restaurants).  She cut our meat for us and cooked it. She explained that most patrons that eat there aren't exactly sure when it's completely cooked or not so she would cook it for us and come by and tell us when it's done or almost done.  She offered... OFFERED EXTRA SIDE DISHES, SALAD, RICE, AND SOUP. (It's rare to be offered, most of the time you have to ask for more)  My friend absolutely looooved the food here and so did I.  But my biggest reason for eating here is: The quality of meat is way better than other places I've seen, especially for the price.  And I'm from Cali so I've had some of the best Korean food there is.. in LA and all over the place.  OVERALL : A well-deserved 5 Stars",

    "text": "Okay, I asked if you hated buffets already, but this one is different.  Honey Pig is an AYCE Korean buffet, BUT (and it's a BIG BUT!), it's really not all you can eat...they place a few limitations on the amount you can request on certain items of the AYCE menu.  It's funny how the waitress helps you cook your food at your table and regulates your intake like a micro-managing boss!  I say funny because I'm not at all concerned or upset about their style of hosting us.  It's to be expected, so don't be alarmed.  Enjoy the fact that someone is watching over the cooking while you enjoy your company and conversations.  The best advice I can give you for the Honey Pig?  For an additional cost, ask them to make kimchee fried rice once you are finished with your meal.  The leftover kimchee on the grill is what they use to make your To Go fried rice!  And it is OH-SO-DELICIOUS when you eat it at home the next day!  YUM!  All in all, everything there is memorable!  If you know what to order that they haven't served you yet, ASK!  They hold back on a lot of things.  We dine here whenever our visitors from Hawaii decide that they are through with hotel buffets, and want something more to their familiarity (Korean food, yakiniku, something they are used to, and what have you).  Sadly, we went here twice last year during the time that the Honey Pig removed their AYCE menus, which is a very strange practice.  But, it was during some kind of convention that was in town that would have probably eaten them out of business!  LOL!  Well, at least, that was the vibe I got from the waitress...  And from this point, I shall conclude and post a new review on our back up alternative...Woo Che AYCE Asian Grill, next door.  3-stars rating only because they are kinda selfish...I guess that's their interpretation of having \"business-sense.\"",

    "text": "This place is awesome. After being to some other places then here, then back to other places, my friends and I concluded that we got spoiled here, because they've got really large grills good for cooking tons of meats, kimchi, and sprouts. That way the wait time for the food to cook isn't too long, unless you're trying to cook some of that super thick bacon.  The meats are all pretty good, except I wouldn't know about the chicken because I don't waste my time on that stuff. Even the pork neck was surprisingly good for what we were expecting.  I'm not exactly sure why, but every time I've been here with my friends, we're the only ones in the restaurant doing all you can eat. And I don't see any other yelpers even mentioning all you can eat. Must be this little secret that only we know about, for a price of about $25 after tax and tip. This is also the only place I've been to where the servers will occasionally come by and stir the meat on the grill around or cut up the bacon for you in an all you can eat Korean BBQ dinner.  There are times where the servers will overrule you. Once was when we were moving/flipping the meats around and they come right up, take the tongs and do it themselves. Another time was when I picked the kimchi off the grill right after the server put it on (because I like my kimchi raw) and she picked it off my plate and threw it back on the grill, instead giving me a different piece, still raw but less pickled, and it was amazingly good. Since they are the connoisseurs of Korean BBQ, I suggest you let them work their magic.  I think the highlight of the night was when our oil drip tray was completely full and we had to ask the server to replace it. One of my friends cracked a joke about how she's never seen that much oil before that she needed to replace it. It ended with her spilling oil on her arm and the floor. Poor girl, at least the oil wasn't hot (I hope).  It's not the cheapest all you can eat Korean BBQ in town but probably the best I've had.  Edit: forgot to mention that for all you can eat, the sirloin and kalbi are limit one order, which was fine with us because those were probably the least impressive meats.",

Maybe I was spoiled by the Korean BBQ s in Korea town (Los Angeles) but there for $25 you get a huge selection of food including but not limited to beef and seafood. They also take away the all you can eat menu for the time that some large conventions are in town.  That seems awfully close to price gouging.",

The second time we came here they gave us some BS menu. \"Convention Menu\" or some type of BS. I was pissed. We ended up just ordering some noodles. Service was REALLY bad. I was not a happy camper and vowed to NEVER return after that visit.   I ended up returning with another couple. This time we had AYCE. I didn't even KNOW they had AYCE! Everything was fantastic. This place was in my heart again. Whatever you do, DON'T let them try to bamboozle you with some BS \"convention\" menu!   We frequent this spot now and I absolutely love it. Service is hit or miss but the food is always on point! PORK BELLY!!!",

Sooooo 3 years later here I am at honey pig with my boyfriend (who loves this stuff and took me to the place that got me sick).   When we stepped in we were greeted and sat immediately. We sat for a few minutes before our waitress Becky came back to us.  We got the AYCE and we're not disappointed Becky never left out sides again (well ok she did but she was always in sight). Cutting our food, giving us tips, answering my wired questions. In fact this place is in my top 3 most attentive places to eat (the other 2 if your curious are there sterling brunch and Texas de Brazil).  At one point the owner came in and checked on every table, talking and hanging out with some. I leaned on the buzzer by accident and she hurried over to me with a look of grave concern on it! She was so nice and so wall all of the staff! I would defiantly come back In fact this place is going on our dinning list (for when we take turns to pick where to eat)",

This place was horribly ventilated. It was so stuffy. Second, I have a family of FIVE, and the person who seated us, Jake, pointed us to a table of FOUR and looked at us to pull up our own chair to the table. We could have been seated at a round table with more seats and more room around the table, but instead we were seated at a small table in the corner directly next to another family in an almost empty restaurant. Third, we were asked if we had ordered yet which we said no to. The lady who was going to help us walked off mid-sentence to grab an AYCE menu....please slow down. One party at a time. And finally, I understand why you can't have a la carte diners at the same table, but we can't leave a child to eat at a separate table while the rest of us are eating together. It's an all for one, and one for all kind of dinner. We ended up walking out because we didn't find their service worth paying for.",

There was only one lady on the floor and she had enough time to go to about 6 other tables including mine. Not only did she deliver our orders quickly, she cooked our food and cut it up for us. The decorations and pig theme are pretty cool as well.  As for the food, their pork belly was great. They were thick cuts that had a lot of meat and not too much fat. Aside from that, the rest of their meat was decent.   They have an interesting circular grill, which is different from most kbbq places. I never had to change the grill and it never burned the meat, which was convenient . After your meal, they offer you a complimentary cinnamon drink which is great and soothing. It's supposed to be good for you after eating oily meat the whole time.  They should probably hire at least one more person on the floor, because it looked like our server was trying really hard. Most other yelp reviews say the service here is bad, but for one person doing the whole job, I commend her.",

An example would be the marinated short ribs that are too fatty in my opinion.  Also, they used to serve beef tongue which is delicious but have taken it off their ayce menu.  The ayce assortment is good and usually do the following in sequence: brisket, sirloin, kalbi and pork belly.  If still hungry, I recommend the bulgogi and squid for the adventurous type.  The spice level on the spicy pork belly is a tad high for my taste but I recommend trying it at least once!  Be prepared to smell like barbecue after leaving Honey Pig so don't plan on going anywhere except home to shower after your meal!",

I also recommend the honey comb pork and spicy pork which you can cook yourself on the table or have them cook it for you in the kitchen.   All the banchan at Honey Pig is delicious, especially the soy marinated potatoes and fish cake. I believe they have raised all the menu prices not too long ago and it is a little overpriced in my opinion, but I still find myself eating here at least once a month!",

Was limifed to 2pcs shrimp, 1 4oz cut of sirloin, and 1 Kalbi rib, but it was only $24.99 for Dinner, and I did have 4oz Dak Gui (chicken), 2 orders (oval serving plate) of Brisket, and 6oz of Bulgogi, that had a great marinade!  The banchai had the kimchi and bean sprouts on the grill, but I removed them because I like them cold/raw.  There was daikon, pickled seaweed, fish cake, and a salad with sweet and salty sesame dressing.  I asked for Bibim Bap sauce for my brisket and Dak Gui, but abandoned it fod the brisket in favor of the salt/pepper/sesame oil dilping sauce, and bean paste.  I normally hit this 24/7 place for dolsot bibim bap, but now know the AYCE is worth it too, except for the one Kalbi rib, or I'd bump them to 5 Stars.  But they are definitely in the 4.5 stars range with me.    Lastly, the staff deserves kudos for attending to my needs despite having a packed house!!!",

    "text": "Except bad service unless you speak Korean or get really lucky.  Two stars for the delicious meat and unique way of doing their food! Ill explain below. But these two reasons are the ONLY good things about Honey Pig.   Service -- TERRIBLE. Was promptly seated and greeted, got our side dishes, and ordered. But after that, it was like we barely existed. They forgot our orders not once but twice. After waiting maybe about 30-40 minutes (note this is the actual time... they just completely forgot our last order and I waited patiently because I thought it was just cooking still) for an item that never arrived, I asked for a check where I was over charged by $20. I asked for it to be corrected and they took it off but still never gave me my last order. I asked if I could take the last order off the bill because I had somewhere else to go at that point and no longer wanted to eat, but the manager said no and gave me the food in a to-go bag. Yay... I guess.   I also asked for tea for the entire table but received 1 cup of tea. Not even the jug they usually do... just a cup. LOL.  Anyway, after looking around, it seems to me that the servers are somewhat biased and prefer Korean patrons. I'm not sure if it was just our server but it seems that Honey Pig, through my friends who have come here on separate occasions, is notorious for terrible service.  Food -- GOOD! Great quality meat, great marination. I love the way they add the bean sprouts and kimchee on the pot and even the fried rice! Reminds me of how the food is done in actual Korea!  AYCE -- should be called AAYCE... Almost all you can eat. It's $21 but items are limited... Like you could only order 1 of certain items. Which sucks because I could pay the same at Sura for actual ALL you can eat!   Overall, food was delicious but the service and trickery of AYCE left me hungry and upset. Never coming back here again.",

They didn't come out to tell us they were closed or make any effort to inform us from inside that they were closed. After we stood outside for 5 minutes we finally got into our car.

I had good memories of it so when my family decided to come here, I was excited.  First off, the service. I had to ask the girl server three times to bring us new plates because they were all dirty. Once is fine but really, when you're bringing back new plates, wouldn't you think to check? Whatever, I wasn't courteous enough to refrain from asking her again and again to bring new ones. All throughout, we asked them to bring the bean paste soup out as soon as it was ready instead of later on like usual and they said okay. Ultimately, they forgot over and over until I finally yelled at them and they brought us three bean paste soups to make up for it, as well as egg. Keep in mind, we had babies who needed the soup to eat since they can't be fed meat, so they ended up sleeping by the time the soup and egg came out. We were all already super full too, and the soup was super salty. The only time they stayed good on service was when we were ordering more alcohol.  Now on to the food. The brisket was the worst I had, and even if we got premium combo and another additional combo, the brisket stays in my memory as being the worst. That's usual though, but I thought the more pricier meats would be better. Nope. The side dishes tasted decent and the usual honey pig's kimchi and bean sprouts were delicious, as well as the salad. However, because the meat was no bueno, this place is an ultimate no.  Won't ever be back.",

Food was very good, but the service wasn't so great. It seems like they're short on staffing for a restaurant that is often busy during lunch time.    The other koreans restaurant i go to usually often give at least 5 side dishes. They only gave us 3 side, including the bean sprout and kimchi cabbage on the side of the hot plate. The sides weren't that appetizing anyways.  I know it's a AYCE restaurant, but the portion compared to the first serving was never the same. When we do ask for more meat, they take a while to come out and all the dishes dont come out at the same time. I probably wouldn't come back here if i had a choice.",

    "text": "Tucked away in the corner of a shopping center on Spring Mountain Rd and S Decatur Blvd.  Make sure to head towards the back end area since it's located right next to Big Lots.  I guess the owners extended the restaurant to the adjacent space as the establishment appears to be bigger than the last time I was here.  I like the addition of long dining tables because it makes it easier to cook and eat at the same time for those with large groups.  Don't get me wrong, I prefer the old setting with circular grills but they're relatively uncomfortable for bigger parties.  Used to frequent at this joint for their AYCE deal.  Since we came a little after 0600 in the morning, we had to order a la carte as AYCE is only served till 2200.  They do, however, offer a large selection of combinations that'll easily serve 3-4 people so it was like we were actually having AYCE.  We opted for the mushroom and beef bulgogi hotpot which was quite delicious but found it rather sweet due to the marinade.  At least our server brought out few condiments to make it spicier: jalapenos, chili sauce and ground red pepper.  First time having ground pepper and I have to say, it certainly brings the dish to a different level.  In fact, I can probably add it to everything and it'll make it better.  Contrary to what everyone claims, customer service was superb!  Perhaps, it could have been just Becky as I've had other incidents in the past when service was lackluster.  I like how she kept refilling our banchans without us even asking for more.  I also appreciate her effort to hold conversations with us despite of the language barrier.  Overall, Honey Pig will always be one of my all-time favorite Korean restaurants in Las Vegas.  Great food quality and excellent customer service.  I definitely recommend this place to locals and tourists alike!",

There wasn't much, but we were charged for TWO orders.  Basically, they charged $3 per person.  There was definitely NOT enough fried rice for two people.  The good thing is that the fried rice could be taken to go.  One star for this visit.  Average of my two visits:  5 stars + 1 star / 2 visits = 3 stars.",

But there were only 2 names ahead of us (party of 8 and a party of 3). Great, I thought!  Hmm, not so much.  We waited one hour to be seated.    Somehow, I saw at least 4 - 5 tables sat before me.  A party of 12 just miraculously was written in ahead of me and then sat. And the lady who signed in after me got bumped down when the server just added a name above her.  Now, I worked in a restaurant before as a host. I know that when you do something like this it causes frustrations and disgruntled guests. Even if this was happening, for whatever reason, I don't think that it was right for the servers to leave the list out for us to see. While we were standing there we saw the server scratch names off the list and insert other names.  Then if that wasn't enough, after we sat down we specifically asked for our order to be made in a weigh that is typical of other Korean barbecue restaurants. And the eyes and the stares that we got from the employees was horrific. We had to continuously ask for certain things and by this point the restaurant wasn't as busy so it couldn't have been that they couldn't accommodate these simple requests.  Rather, they just don't care for the customer at all.",

Our server was rude, dropped off our food without saying anything and when the grill top got burned, we asked for getting it changed, they said they didn't have any new grill top to change and we gotta use spoons to clean it ourselves. We asked for a towel or something to clean it ourselves and the server ealked away and simply ignored us after that. Also, we were told the A/C wasn't working when we walked in. After 4 more tables came in and the place started getting really hot and smokey, the A/C mysteriously started working. So basically they try to not turn on the air conditioning at night unless the place starts getting too hot. Absolutely horrible service, I recommend staying away from this place. The all we can eat menu is very small options to compare to other places.",

One of the best parts of the meal is when they bring the rice out at the end and make fried rice with all the scraps on the grill.

Ok I'll be honest, I'm not saying that they have the best Korean food I've ever had or anything like that. But still, they have good variety of menu items you can choose from and besides, they have All-you-can-eat for a very reasonable price (14.95 lunch 19.95 dinner). What more can u ask for?  Oh, there is one thing. Sometimes when I was there, the place was really busy. But it seemed like everytime, it looked like the place was understaffed. Ok, I'm all for cutting cost and all that fun stuff but this could possibly hurt the image of the restaurant.   I usually get Spicy Chicken (30 dollars) which is enough food for 3~4 people (I went with two of my friends who also eat a lot and we couldn't walk out of the place). Good deal right? They are really spicy though so for those who like spicy food, I dare you to try it.  Overall, good food, little bit overpriced but a good place to go for some Korean grub.",

My party did the all you can eat option - while they were expedient when it came to bringing anything that cost extra (soju, short rib and kimchi bean paste soup, etc) it took almost twenty minutes to get water, and that was after asking three or four times. I don't think they ever brought out the short ribs. Almost every time we asked for another dish, they either took their sweet time or had to be repeatedly reminded. This did not make for a pleasant experience overall, but the food really was amazing. I love the grill apparatus that they use - I actually wish that they used it at a restaurant that focused on customer service. The prices were very fair too - this place could be a lot better, if they would get a more competent staff.",

    "text": "Well...it's not that often that a place that serves AYCE grilled meat can disappoint me but I guess there's a first for everything.   Where should I begin? We came in around 4PM to a restaurant that was not even half full and waited for a table for 15 minutes. When we got to our table we were left alone again for 10 minutes. We were pretty hungry at this point so we order a bit of food. The waitress gave us a stern look and told us it was too much in a more than your mother's naggy tone kind of voice. I assured her we can handle it. Classic rule of dining is that the customer is always right, even if they are wrong. I shrugged it off.   This hasn't been out first time to a Korean AYCE style restaurant but after our interaction earlier, I guess our server took it upon herself to make up our minds on how we want to eat. We tried to keep it pleasant and light hearted but she kept on getting pushier and pushier as the afternoon went on. At the end of dinner we had paid and left her a decent tip (18%) underneath one of the cups. We made sure it was visible so it doesn't get accidentally get swept away during the table being turned over. We were in our car and about to go when the waitress ran out to our passenger door and knocked angrily on my car door. I lowered the window and asked her what was wrong. Our astute waitress, still huffing and puffing angrily, said we didn't even tip her. I calmly said we did and where it was. She then replied with an \"Oh...\" and then quickly ran back inside. We waited there 5 mins to see if she would come out and apologize as I thought we were entitled one for the way she was acting and for leaving prints on my car window.   We will never return here. Never have I been so turned off at dinner by bad service. Had I known that that was the kind of service I would be getting I would have spent my money at an In and Out and got my money's worth and a smile to go with my chocolate shake.",

A lot of people complain about the ban-chan (side dishes) not being of the highest quality, but I like to grill mine, and I like the fact that if you do this with over fermented kimchi, it actually tastes better IMO than using a kimchi that is less fermented.

    "text": "Overall, I like Honey Pig.  I have wanted to try this place several times, but like a lot of the restaurants I eventually tried it is all about timing.  Anyway, I went with a fellow Yelper to Honey Pig for dinner.  He wasn't too hungry and settled for something from the soup menu, but what we were hoping to order was some good olf fashion traditional Bibimbap (which was not on their menu). After debating if I was hungry enough to order AYCE or try to find something that appeals to me from the rest of the menu, I went for the dinner AYCE.  There are 2 items that you can only order once (basically the short rib meat that has been filet, so no bones to deal with and some other cut of meat which I can't recall at the moment).  And they have everything you cam order from the lunch AYCE plus (....)  For one person, I think HP's AYCE setup is not really to my liking.  You basically order everything by the dish (same arrangement as Tofu House), and not like Wooche or Sura (you get a plate and load up on whatever suits your fancy). And it is hard to finish everything on a plate by plate basis as a lone AYCE diner, unless you have a voracious appetite like mine. Even then it was really pushing it to try and sample everything.  Hopefully next time I will be back with a group, so we can divide and conquer and try each and every item, including the 2 that were unavailable when I went.  Pluses:   1) If you are lazy or prefer to have your food cooked for you, this is the place.  The waitresses can do all the cooking and you can concentrate on the eating. 2) Very good exhaust system. No worries about coming out smelling like BBQ. Very helpful if you are here for lunch and have to go back to work for a few more hours. 3) Reasonable price, food overall is good. 4) The special metal pan used for BBQ is pretty cool, and food does not really stick to it.  Undecided: 1) Their Teriyaki Chicken does not taste like what you would think a Teriyaki Chicken to taste like (after it is cooked).  It is basically a spicy Korean interpretation, which is okay. I might like it more if it is called something else.  Minuses: 1) They were out of some items on their AYCE menu. 2) 2 items are limited to 1 order.  Location: Very convenient for those that can get to the Chinatown area on Spring Mountain. In the same strip mall as Pho So 1, WooChe and Big Lot.  With plenty of parking, although the closest ones may not be readily available when you go during mainstream lunch and dinner times and also on weekends.  They are open 24 hours, but AYCE is only available during certain hours (for dinner it ends by 10pm).  4 Yelp stars for me.  Looking to go back again, maybe with more seasoned Honey Pig veterans.",

The honey pig system is designed to limit quantity , end of story .",

    "text": "Finally at last! I was able to walk in, sit down, lunch in and enjoy the AYCE.   Meat is very tasty and RED. Pork belly and pork neck was also good but wished it was sliced a little thinner so it would have cooked crispier.    I did enjoy that they bring the meat and cook in front of you rather than you going to a buffet line and seeing all of the meat just sitting and waiting to be picked and barbecued.  The side dishes were a variety of fresh items.  Whatever that I had asked for which I would normally get in a buffet line of other korean bbq, they would bring it to me.  The only thing that I wasn't too fond of is their bean paste which is very critical to me. It looked and tasted different.  Additionally, I saw an ad on yelp that Honey Pig lunch buffet is $12.95, which is False advertisement because when I was in there today, the lunch was $14.99 which is apparent that the price has been raised. I did find the price fixing a little annoying but oh well....  Please fix this....  Thank you!",

    "text": "I've frequented Honey Pig on several occasions a few years back with my friends for some good food and drinks. Every time I was here though, I felt that the waitress would look down on me as if I was a 5 year old child and it wouldn't matter what I would say or want from her, she would simply ignore it. After these repetitious experiences, I stopped visiting until one day my family was moving. My poor father, sister, and boyfriend had worked up a sweat all day long without water in the desert heat and decided to come to Honey Pig since it was the closest Korean restaurant.  When we walked in, the place was busy but not packed. We were asked to pick a seat and was given the menu and iced water to start-- hallelujah. We finished the pitcher of water faster than you can say Mississippi and asked for another pitcher of water. The waitress eagerly answered yes but did not budge from where she was standing. She continued her conversation with a fellow waitress and I kept giving her an evil glare, hoping that she'll feel my radiating energy but she didn't. When she finally moved to take our orders, I asked for water again and without apologies, asked her coworker to grab another pitcher for us.   After waiting a good while for our food, it finally arrived. The bulgogi was a little dry and too sweet. Even though we had been moving all day and thus starving, we were hesitant to finish the meal. At one point, my dad asked for some more lettuce and jalapenos and, no kidding, had to ask 4 times before someone even pretended to listen to our needs. I ordered the naengmyun and I must say it's one of the worst I've ever tasted and let me just tell you, I'm a naengmyun fanatic and have had my fair share of good and bad noodles. It was simply salty and nothing more to it. I must have taken three bites before I put my chopsticks down and refused to eat any more.  I've held a \"tip-dependent\" job since my freshman year in high school and I'd like to think that I know what good service is. Unless I am highly dissatisfied, I tip at least 15% wherever I go. However, at the end of our meal I told my dad that he should only leave a $2 tip because of the less than desirable food and even more horrible service.   I guess if I was starving for a week without water, I'd rate the food as decent but simply for service, I would never come back. I don't know how I even entertained the idea of coming back here after such a horrible experience but I know now, never again.",

    "text": "Just went here late late last night (aka early this morning) after work and what a great find... open at all hours of the night with a great set-up for Korean BBQ. We ordered the pork belly for $22.99 and I craved some soup/noodles so I got the kalguksu for $10.99.   I actually would give this place 4 stars if I thought the food was incredible but to be honest, I will have to go back a few more times and try other items on the menu to get an accurate feel for the place. The kalguksu was nothing like I expected... the noodles seemed cheap and the seafood wasn't of great quality. Basically, it felt like I was eating instant noodle soup and not the authentic dish I had hoped for. The pork belly is a bit thick in a traditional Korean sense.... this dish usually comes out thinly sliced.   The best thing about this restaurant is its originality. They put the kimchi and bean sprouts right on the grill with your meat, and after you're done, they fry rice on top as a complimentary service. The kimchi is fantastic off the grill and was probably my favorite part of the meal :). I love that this restaurant is not super stingy with their rice and foods like some other places in Vegas.   The service was 5 stars. They were attentive, polite, and well-spoken. Their English is broken; however, because I speak fluent Korean there was no problem with communication.   I am hoping to go back soon and be able to upgrade this place with another star because it really is a charming little place :)",

Next, in the combos, normally you would get drinks along with the combo for at least the number of people it serves, here we only got one. so of course we ended uo paying for more drinks. Then to top that off, they charge $2 for a freaking refill. COME ON!  So then our meat gets there and all the sides along with two small bowls of rice that we are charged extra for. Soup was also included so I had asked for it and the server says,\"you need it now?\" in a smug way. Like really???  Then she cooks the fried rice at the end and it wasnt worth even the slightest minute to wait for bc it tasted rotten. Ewwww!   Ill just stick to DJK like ive been.",

So the service started out good, lady was nice when you walked in but if you are not Korean you dont' get any service, no steamed egg, no soup (don't think I want the soup either, saw a waitress taste one with the spoon and put the spoon back in then brought it another table). We got three sides and the kimchee smelled fishy, I have eaten a lot of kimchee and this is the first that smelled like that, they didn't even give us the soy sauce dip till we asked for it.   Service at all asian places suck but this is below bad, what if you have never tried korean BBQ before, do you not get the banchan?   As for the meat selection, it's a joke for AYCE,  -One order of short ribs allowed, it was not good -One order of sirloin and it was chewy -Bugolgi was way too sweet and really fatty -Brisket,  only thing edible  Did not try the rest, just stuck with the brisket since the rest was so bad.   Towards the end we had to waive down someone to just bring us more ice tea.   This was the first and last time for this place.",

Overall, they do things here different than other KBBQ spots, let me explain....  I was excited to finally try this place out, not only cuz I was with family visiting from outta town but simply because they were equipped with the upside down wok or whatever it's called and it was AYCE!   The water they served to us was different, my cousin knew what it was tho, corn water.  I had it and it's best served cold. You can also request regular water.    I'm a meat lover and I just wanted to get crackin on the brisket already!  But then the server puts kimchi and bean sprouts on the pan first... Huh?!?! An then she started cooking our meat for us, little by little. That irked me.  So we threw ALL the meat on the pan at once to save our experience a little bit as we were a very hungry bunch.  The banchi sides were OK, not the best. No doubt it was AYCE but they should just let us be and cook it ourselves.  As for the meat quality, GOOD! Price, lower it just a tad bit and Honey Pig will be more crackin than a plumber bending down.",

    "text": "I left cold, hungry and penniless.  My friends and I were in the mood for AYCE Koren BBQ and this place was on my must try list.  Upon walking through the door, we were promptly greeted, seated toward the front of the restaurant, received a pitcher of water and a couple menus.  Within minutes we ordered the pork belly, spicy pork belly, kalbi and the boneless sirloin (I forget what it's called) all off the AYCE menu.  The waitress came back with our four different banchan, the sirloin and put kim chee, sprouts and pork belly on the grill.  From there it all went downhill...slowly.    We devoured the pork belly, but the lady had turned the fire off so we kind of just sat there wondering what we should do.  Meanwhile, every time people came through the front door, it wouldn't close.  Which meant the frigid night air was blowing right on us and other tables seated near the front.  Without complaining, we kept standing up to close it.  You'd think that after about 20 times of doing this (along with the other table near us) some employee would have seen us and offered to fix it.  But you'd be wrong.    Finally, a nice waitress [the only nice one?] came by and we immediately bombarded her with requests: if she could somehow fix the door; please start the fire again; could we get more food, water and banchan; and we asked for steamed rice.  It took about 15 minutes before ANYONE came within earshot of our table.  Why on earth would it take 15 minutes to get water refilled, let alone more food?  This is a restaurant, right?  They serve food here, right?  Regardless, we were finally able to defrost and we finally had some food and water!  Woo hoo!    Warning: buzz kill coming.  About halfway through the sirloin, we started wondering when the rest of our food was coming.  And we kept wondering until one of my friends stood up, walked to the counter and ASKED for food: kalbi, spicy pork belly and more rice.  Shortly thereafter, the spicy pork arrived...but no rice.    Not so shortly thereafter, my friend had to STAND UP AGAIN AND ASK for the kalbi.  This time we tried to be smart about it and order three orders.  Nope, they said.  We could only have ONE order per table.  Um, hello, the menu does say one order, but it's one per person.  Regardless, we were hungry and tired of waiting so we took what we could get...but no rice.  After finishing the one order of kalbi, we still wanted more.  However, having sat there for more than 2 hours and having only four small orders delivered, we were fed up of not being fed.  We were tired, frustrated, cold (they turned off the heat again) and the servers were avoiding eye contact with us.  In fact, they didn't even drop the bill.  We had to walk up to the counter and ASK FOR OUR BILL!!!  Talk about insult to injury!  Having been near the door, we could have just walked out without paying and no one would have noticed us gone.      However, being people of principle, we paid our $60+ dollars for the \"food.\"  Then we left...to go eat somewhere else.  Despite having AYCE, we were STILL HUNGRY!!!",

I saw they had iced tea and asked if those included refills and she said yes so I said I, MYSELF would take the iced tea, she didn't bother asking anybody else what they wanted, which also by the way that tea tastes like sewer water, I had to ask multiple times for sugar to make it half way decent enough to drink. We asked for brisket and we didn't even get a chance to ask for anything else because she was already gone. It only got more and more ridiculous after that. They brought the brisket and I am not exaggerating it was literally one piece of brisket per person. Is like she could not take multiple orders at once, and for a table with GROWN people she would bring enough food for one. It's ridiculous and it legitimately got to a point that we had NO FOOD on our grill while everyone else had their grill extremely filled with food. So it must of been something against us, which I cannot wrap my head around because we're not bad people we look like your regular average Jane and Joe (lol) now I hate complaining, I bit my tongue until we got to the point of the grill being empty for a good few minutes. I loudly but respectfully said I had asked multiple times for our order and we were not getting serviced like we should, that I could clearly see that everybody had their grill filled with heaps of food while we were sitting there with a complete empty grill. Even the girls that were sitting next to us were completely dumbfounded at the way we were getting serviced, when I complained they started shaking their heads and as soon as she left they both were like we cannot believe this, I mean COUPLES were getting more food than our table of four was..... after I complained they got their shit together and started bringing more food but it had completely ruined the mood, we were all pissed off, we weren't having a good time. It truly sucks that the service was so bad because the food was actually pretty good. Needless to say I will not return, I usually don't go eat out so when I do I like to have a good experience. Also, no manager, no supervisor so everybody seems to do whatever the fuck they want. It was by far the worst service I've ever gotten in my 24yrs of life. My brother in law ended up paying over $100 for service that was complete and utter shit. When we walked out one of the girls that was sitting at the table next to us ran after us and gave me a little paper with 3 different Korean BBQ places to try, that was super nice of her, so I'll try some of those :).",
