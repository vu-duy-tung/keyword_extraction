I swear the chefs have no idea what chinese and thai food is supposed to taste like. If I buy an asian cookbook can I open a restaurant?  Seriously, for the third time the pad thai was a wattery soup that tasted like jiffy peanut butter.  The lettuce wraps had absolutly NO seasoning or flavor. The mu shu duck was fair but the pancake was so dry it just crumbled upon folding. Why is this place soooooo bad yet stays alive. If you think panda express is great asian food you will still be utterly disappointed! There are so many great noodle shops in Vegas that are traditional, delicious,  and less expensive, try the one in the back corner of the Venetian!  By the way, I was sober every time I've eaten here.  Do not waste your money or one good evening in Vegas.",

One of the gals tried to order the beef flank steak with noodle soup (essentially mi with tendon), and was immediately and strongly discouraged by the waiter.  The soups were the strong point -- broths were good, the wonton soup with a boatload of wontons and noodles is a Vegas steal at $10 for a huge bowl.

The pork buns were good, but at $12 for three they were way overpriced.  The vegetable curry I had was not very spicy, was heavy on the eggplant, and was only ok.  The best thing we ordered was sweet and sour chicken, but it was't much better than panda express and sure cost a lot more!  Wish I would have consulted yelp! before checking this place out.  One plus was that the service was friendly.",

I have to say that Noodle Shop was actually an ok place even though you are paying 2x to 3x more for Asian cuisine. You are definitely paying for the convenience, but it definitely hits the spot after a long night of partying. I had the roasted duck noodle soup and the preserved egg congee. The roasted duck noodle soup was pretty good, although after a while, you notice the heavy presence of salt. So, after I tasted too much salt, I tried to tame the salt with a bowl of congee. The congee wasn't good at all. I had to douse my congee with pepper to make it taste better which was disappointing.",

    "text": "So on this trip to Vegas I decided I wanted to eat something else besides burgers, steaks, and buffet food. So I finally gave in and went for some overpriced Chinese food.  I came pretty late (like thirty minutes before closing..which I think was midnight), so I was seated very quickly.      The atmosphere of the place is pretty cozy and chic, but without having that uber \"hey look we're a fusion restaurant\" look. The menu had a good amount of items that seemed pretty authentic. Anyway I ordered some Chinese broccoli in oyster sauce, beef chow fun, and a roasted duck noodle soup.     Service throughout the night was very quick and friendly (even though the place was pretty much closing) and the servers constantly came by to check on me...which was nice. The food on the other hand...well I don't know what it was...but nothing was that hot...in temperature. As if everything was cooked, but sat out for five or ten minutes before they served it to me.  As for the quality, it was somewhere between what you'd get at a Chinese buffet and actually going to a restaurant in a decent Chinatown. As for prices...well it's Vegas so it's definitely higher than what you'd expect from a Chinatown place (i.e. Beef Chow Fun was like $15...where as in Chinatown would be closer to $8-10). But not going to make you go broke by any means.  I think my only major beef with the place was that my hot tea was luke warm...kind of annoying.    Anyway The Noodle Shop is definitely not a place I would go out of my way for. But the food quality was good enough, the prices were fair, and the service was very good. If I was craving Chinese food and in the Mandalay Bay or near it...I wouldn't hesitate to stop in.   ~G",

We were both a little hungover and some chow mein and fried rice sounded perfect.   I SO wish I had checked YELP before dining here. Service was horrible...we were seated right after a couple who looked wasted but were given a great booth and we were given a table in the middle of the dining area...um no  Me: \"Can we PLEASE be moved to a booth?\"   Hostess: \"Oh, hmmm..okaayyy...is this better for you\" gave us a nice big booth with some big attitude to boot.   Me: \"Yes actually this is PERFECT\"  Server was quick, too quick for not being crowded at all. As if she didn't care and just didnt want to talk to us at all. They also forgot my drink, which just irked me in my hungover state.   To the food: the Spring Rolls came out about 10 mins after we ordered them and they were mildly warm. To me this equals: They are premade and left out and then poorly reheated...ew.   I got chicken chow mein...greasy, slimy, gross.  My BF got pork fried rice...I dont like pork and this pork looked totally uncooked and the rice was not \"fried\" and barely had any veggies.   Our server never came back to ask us if we wanted water and since there was so much sodium in the food we were dying for water. Had to practically yell at her across the room because she was darting about and talking with the other servers.   Bill was about $60 which is fine since we were in Vegas, but NOT for  the quality of the food or the service.",

    "text": "We stopped by The Noodle Shop before seeing the Lion King. I had the crazy idea that the larger casinos' restaurants would at least be \"decent\", so I didn't check Yelp beforehand. I should have known better!  My boyfriend ordered pho and I ordered vegetable pad Thai. We split the seaweed salad as an appetizer. The seaweed was good but the added tofu was unnecessary. Overall though, pretty good. Since there aren't many vegetarian options on the menu, I asked if the pad Thai could be made with vegetables instead of meat. She said that wouldn't be a problem.   Our dishes came and I was disappointed to see that my entree consisted of nothing more than orange, oily noodles and a few pieces of onion. That's it. No extra veggies, peanut crumbles or fresh bean sprouts. I'm sure it would have been acceptable for some hungover frat boy, but I expected a little more. It lacked the taste and texture that's pretty standard at even the worst Thai restaurants. My boyfriend compared his soup to \"mall pho\" and it was missing the traditional condiments.   Overall, this place definitely wasn't worth the price and I recommend skipping it.",

The noodles were similar to uncooked ramen, and were covered in a thick cornstarch like Chinese goop. We knew it was going to be terrible when we realized you could get pad Thai, pho, and Steamed pork buns all at the same place. The lo mai gai took forever, and surprise-- smelled like a fart when opened. I would eat it normally only if it was the only thing available. I saw a sad lonely man at one table and two old white ladies sitting together, not knowing any better. Perfect for them I suppose. Literally the worst food I've eaten in years. Avoid at all costs, there is great Asian food everywhere but here.",

I believe it's not flavored enough and it's like a Chinese noodle soup, with simply clear broth with a little chopped  mushroom, scallions and bamboo shoots! It wasn't really special. The place looks nice but it's seems it's just a facade. I got frustrated there was nothing special with their food. And their servers too! They  seems to lack courtesy and We felt like I'm we were market place while dining. There were lots of shouting and sluggish  movement by their servers. There was even someone using a broom and a pan cleaning around the dining hall while we were there eating! Disgusting! I started to question why would Mandalay Bay have to have such a mediocre Chinese restaurant!",

But i paid $125 for pasta in another restaurant in mandalay and $20 for a beef sandwich next door for lunch at the seabreeze cafe so the prices are in line.  If you want chinese food here i hope the other reviews don't put you off.  I ordered mongolian beef and the bbq mix which included hainan chicken.",

We were staying at the Mandalay Bay and we've walked right by it for years, but never bothered to try it.   Well now we have and I can say that I would definitely go back if given the chance.  The Orange peel chicken was soooo good - I am still thinking about it.  The flavor was delicious - and though it was fried, it was not battered so it was not greasy at all.  But the flavor - truly delicious.    Hubby had the noodles with shrimp and xo sauce - which was very expensive for what it was - but still quite tasty.    Service was eager and attentive.  Price overall was expensive for Chinese food.  But if  you're staying at Mandalay Bay - this is a solid choice for a bite.",

Definitely a possibility of a language issue there... but hey, if you like carrot juice, they have it.  We ordered the Hong Kong Noodles and Singapore Noodles. The first was on the bland side while the latter was bursting with flavor. The Dr. the taught me a few tricks of using the provided sauces, spices to enhance the meal. The food was great and you get a lot for your money. We could have easily shared 1 of the noodle plates.   Still the service needs to improve. As we ate, you could see tables around us also getting slow service and waiting for their bills. I stick with 3 stars based on the quality and quantity of food.",

The prices are lofty, but the food is homey and comforting.  We decided to get the dim sum sampler, the duck noodle soup, the shrimp dumpling noodle soup, and the sichuan.  The sampler? Probably not worth the $20. You get four different types of dim sum, with 2-3 pieces of each type. Tasty, but it might've been better if it were $10 or so.  Everything else was very good. The duck in the noodle soup was perfectly cooked, the shrimp dumplings were tasty and plump, and both noodle soups had great broths and noodles. The eggplants were especially delicious.  Why a three? Though the food was tasty, I JUST found out that <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> offered a coupon for the Noodle Shop...

On a relatively slow night, I was seated immediately, but it was fifteen minutes before a waiter came to my table and asked \"What do you want?\"  \"Well, a menu would probably be a good start.\" I replied.  He disappeared for another five minutes before dropping off a menu without a word.  Ten minutes later, same thing; \"What do you want?\"  I asked some questions about the food that were answered with only the barest minimum of information.  Service with a snarl seemed the order of the night.  I finally settled on the curried noodles and a cold sake. I should note here, that while I believe that there are several sake options, none other than cold/hot were offered to me, and there was no drink menu.  The dish was like a package of store-bought ramen noodles with just a hint  of curry flavor, but TONS of salt. It also had a few shrimp and some duck bits in it, which was fine for me - but was not mentioned on the menu. Vegetarians beware.   Sadly, with such a salty dish, I never got a refill on my water, nor on my sake - as a matter of fact, the waiter never visited my table again until he brought the check. He never asked if I wanted anything else - desert, maybe - and I had to beg for another glass of water.  He then hovered over me while I figured out the bill (almost $40 for ramen and a glass of cheap sake).  Horrible, horrible, horrible. ...AND, I might add, Horrible.  Don't do it.",

My dish had crispy noodles and seafood. It was bland and the texture was sort of uneven (?). My mom's Vietnamese noodle soup was bland and my dad's Pad Thai had no sauce. The Thai tea was good and the service was kind.",

It wasn't seasoned much, but a scoop of chili sauce helped clear my sinuses.   My friend ordered the sweet and sour chicken, which she wasn't impressed with. The smaller chicken pieces were almost entirely breading and were very hard. She wished she had ordered my lunch.   The staff was polite, took our order, and brought our food out promptly. I did not have any issues with the service.  This place is pretty good, but you should make sure to order its namesake- NOODLES.",

    "text": "The Noodle Shop was good.  I know most Asian places in Las Vegas, on the strip in the hotels (not including Panda Express types) tend to be expensive, in the realm of 2x - 3x the price you'd find at Chinatown, with maybe some Asian naysayers touting the possible whitewashing and lack of authenticity of some Chinese restaurants.  Let me tell you 'tho... I've tried most of the overpriced Chinese restaurants in the high end hotels, and I've never had a bad meal.  Sure, there is a bit of sticker shock when you see the menu and get the bill, but the food is indeed delicious and good most of the time.  So, with that I do give 'em the * * * A-OK rating, which I would say I'd come back again and also would refer others to try.",

Albeit being on the strip, I understand that pricing is going to be a little more \"premium\", however... the dim sum came out to around $30 and was supposed to feed two people. I could've honestly finished it on my own and still be hungry.  For $30, you can get much value else where especially if you head over to the restaurants on Spring Mountain if you are ever craving Asian cuisine.  To add on to my experience... the soups just aren't worth it either. The service was quick and the server was friendly.... food was just underwhelming especially for the price it was listed at. I would expect more quality being at a nice hotel like Mandalay Bay.",

I love any place that calls itself a noodle shop, especially one with the Asian flair. We found ourselves here for an early dinner and were quickly seated. It only took me a short few minutes before I knew I wanted it all. There was Laksa from Singapore, Ramen from Japan, Fried noodles from different provinces in China,l and the list went on and on. I ended up getting the Pork Ramen and the Duck with rice while my wife went with an assortment of different dumplings. Service was amazing especially the very personable manager that night who went from table to table in even more joy than myself this night. My Ramen was good, flavors were good with ample toppings to go with it, the noodles were very good. My duck was also very tasty and cooked perfectly to go with the rice and vegetables. Dumplings were o.k for the most part. Assorted dumpling platter seemed a bit small for the price but the chive dumplings were absolutely amazing even though they were overpriced. Overall I was happy with my experience, service like I said was amazing, from the manager to the buss boy. Prices were a bit high but I expect that at the Mandalay, and the food was good. I would definitely go back for another try next time I am in Vegas, Aloha",

This made me excited that this might be an authentic Chinese dish. Much to my surprise it had hardly any spice at all! Wine is overpriced.

My group of 6 needed to have a quick lunch, and since we were staying at the hotel, decided to give it a try.  We each ordered something different on the menu.  I went with the beef noodle soup, while my friends tried the pho, broccoli beef, mapo tofu, pad thai, and some chicken stir fry dish.  To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted.  They used the wrong sauces and the wrong noodles in each dish.  My friend that ordered the pho had to send it back (the first time he's ever had to do this at a restaurant).  This place should be shut down, then burned to the ground.",

    "text": "Would we ever eat here if it wasn't for the comp that comes with our stays?  Probably not.  Food tastes okay, but nothing tastes great for the prices they charge.  And this surely isn't Chinatown in LA.  Garlic shrimp, chicken & beef was a little sweeter than I would've liked.  But nice serving portion for two.  The shrimp wonton noodle soup was more bland than I'd like, but plenty of noodles and something like 6-8 (big) wontons, so hey, that's a definitely plus.  The calamari we probably wouldn't get again.  Cooked for too long as they were very chewy/rubbery, and the garlic salt & pepper didn't really cling on like the way it does when you order it from a 'legit' restaurant.  Service is okay.  Our drinks were refilled and nothing landed on the table cold, but then again we were wrapping up just as they started seating the ocean of people who were coming out of UFC 143, so I can't speak for how they are when they're busy.   That food with two sodas cost us just a little over $55, including tax & tip, so not bad for 'hotel' food for two, but again, without the comp, we wouldn't be eating here.  I wouldn't recommend this place either.  I'll definitely take the Dragon Noodle Co (?) at Monte Carlo over this place (that one has combo dinners/specials for 2+ people with bigger portions, more choices & better food).",

(bad luck) Ok remember where you are..... listen to the staff. They are almost all from China or Hong Kong Cantonese speaking!  the place is called Noodles ! it will be overpriced and not as good as Monterey park or your last visit to a Hong Kong street corner. Do not order the Pho, the Thai food, and for that matter ....the Japanese udon! These are all different Asian countries ! Thats like going to a place called  \" EuroBeef \" ... having the same guy making Brats, Beef Wellington, and  Beef Bourguignon... Have what these guys make all the time... Chinese noodle soup and the congee.... again overpriced, but that seems to be the theme in this hotel!  I had the seafood won ton noodle soup.... with chilean seabass? Yes it was really seabass (i was skeptical at first) .... seems like a waste in the soup . Really it was not bad and was as tender and buttery as any Chilean seabass. I have been reading reviews about the service.....well i am not defending by any means, but have they been to Chinatown / Monterey Park at all??!!  I know it looks like PF Changs....    Anyway my girlfriend had the Pho..... I warned her. It came with  Italian Basil like the kind you use on Caprese, and not the Thai/Asian  (her review will be 1 star! lol) The congee did look good too...",

Long story short, the food was okay and we paid  around $11 for effing soup that was just blah. We were still hungry and ordered the combination fried rice which was $12 blah, but for $12 I was expecting a mountain full of rice. Instead we got a speed bump of rice.   Overall this place was an overall bust, that placed $25 in my pocket. If you can't find anything to eat at the Mandalay that's quick and cheap I recommend walking a little further to the Luxor or go to the Cafe.",

    "text": "This was a frustrating and not so tasty dining experience.   We are at Mandalay, and I was overcome with a craving for noodles. The obvious choice (without doing the smart thing and jumping on the 15 and heading to Spring Mountain) was The Noodle Shop.  We were seated quickly, but it took quite some time for our waiter to take our order. When he arrived, we wanted his suggestions for the best noodles. He recommended a XO Vietnamese noodle with shrimp, the most expensive noodle. My husband warned me that the waiter was just trying to up sell the pricey dish. Regardless, it didn't sound too appealing to me, when our waiter returned, I went with the Singapore curry noodle. I wanted to get tofu instead of shrimp, but our waiter said it would be $2 extra! Sorry, but that is unacceptable. If I am not getting shrimp, there should not be an upcharge for tofu. So, I went with shrimp even though I wasn't planning on eating them.   My husband ordered the $26 Vietnamese noodle with shrimp. That's right. He ordered the thing he had warned me against. Crazy husband.  My curry noodles were edible, but over curried (this coming from a die hard curry addict) and they were lacking that seasoned wok flavor.   My husband's dish was sad. The portion was teeny, and the jumbo shrimp were no larger than the standard shrimp at Red Lobster. The flavor was just eh. He was so disappointed that he called over the manager and told her they should take the dish off the menu (True, but I was still embarrassed!). When he asked why in the world this dish was $26, she said it was the XO. For $26, my husband should have at least gotten tipsy off the noodles. He didn't. I am generally okay with a Strip premium, but this was unacceptable for a pretty casual dining experience with mediocre flavor and sub par service.    My visions of a happy, noodle filled belly were squashed. Sorry, Noodle Shop, but there were just too many issues.",

I was looking for a moderately priced Asian restaurant on the south strip, and looking at the menu online beforehand, saw a lot of things that sounded good.  I should have known otherwise when we walked in and only 2 tables were occupied. Dining companion and I both ordered chicken dishes for the main course. She thought the chicken tasted rubbery, as did I. I usually associate this with undercooked meat. We both got very sick to the stomach about 2 hours later and these dishes were the likely culprit. We spent the remainder of our evening on the toilet back at the hotel room.  The only positives were that the server was attentive (because there were only like 7 customers at 6pm) and the Chicken Satay appetizer (which appeared to be cooked properly) was actually pretty good.  Don't go here. Even if you are trying to burn casino comps or something. Read the other reviews, we aren't making this stuff up.",

The main issue is the food was never hot.  I did go twice but only because I really wanted to try the Seafood Pan fried Noodles. I wasnt thrilled with it.    The first day, I had the lunch special of chicken, shrimp and beef with garlic sauce and 2 mini spring rolls (the app should have been served earlier than the main and it was not, so tell them if you want it that way).  That dish was excellent and had it been hot, it would have been stellar.  It came with white rice.  The lunch special is 18.99 and they have about 8 choices of specials; my dish was enough for 2.  Service was slow the first day and quick the second day. My water was refilled constantly and the waiters were very nice as was the Maitre D.  It is a casual restaurant located right off the casino so there is some people watching to be done if you get a table closer to the front.    I would recommend the restaurant for the chicken, beef, and shrimp dish but not for the pan fried noodles. I also would be specific and ask for very hot food and apps served first. None of these requests should be needed but if done, this review would have been markedly higher.",

Once we were seated, we looked at the menu only to find the prices were pretty freakin nuts for the type of food this place offers. (ie. $20 for pho, $18 for pad thai, $18 for wonton noodle, $26 for wonton, scallop, pork, vegetable soup, $10 eggrolls, $4 for thai ice tea, etc **these aren't the exact prices but its around this price**).  After ordering our food, we had to wait about 15 minutes just to get our drinks. Had to wait another 45 minutes to get our food. I guess they wanted to serve us all at once so half of the food that came out was already cold or room temperature. Onto the food.... ABSOLUTELY the worst chinese/vietnamese/thai food we've ever had. Everything lacked flavor, meats and seafood was chewy, soup tasted water down, portions were kind of small for what you pay for, etc. I work and eat in downtown Oakland China Town all the time, and The Noodle Shop doesn't even compare to anything there.... Pho or wonton noodle soup is my hang over food, and this place just wanted to make me throw everything up.  This place was highly understaffed, and the cooks were slow....

I also tried the orange peel beef, the chicken with black bean sauce, and some of the pho broth which was totally yummy.  Everyone I was with liked their food quite a bit!

If you want to eat good Asian food, don't go to the noodle house",

    "text": "I love this place.   Ok , the food is straight up average , BUT .. I like that the staff is Asian and they're honest with suggestions.  I've eaten here at least 10 times now.  It's been consistent over the years.   If you're looking for the best of the best , this isn't the place.  If however you're looking for decent consistent Asian noodles then this is a great place.    My favorite is the chow fun and house special fried rice.   The Pho is VERY American so if you're looking to re-live that trip to Vietnam it's not gonna be for you.... But I still like it in a hurry.  Honestly it's probably only on the menu as a stop gap for traveler who only know Pho from some American back home spot.   Bottom line ... It's clean , fast , honest , and priced accordingly for where its at.    It's my go to spot for quick lunch and light dinner when I'm at The Mandalay.    Enjoy.",

Ok food.  I had the seafood tom kha, which was loaded with squid and shrimp and noodles.  Broth just ok,  i expected a lot more flavor.  We ordered a calamari appetizer that was below par.  Large parties are charged 18% gratuity, which we were not informed of and created quite the headache afterward.  Two star due to value. $100 for 4 bowls of soup and an appetizer.

    "text": "If you are like me, you are reading this review as you sit at this restaurant wondering why everything is so awful. You may be wondering why an experienced yelper like myself would be checking reviews AFTER they are already eating somewhere. First, every other restaurant had a long wait. I was REALLY hungry, hubby wasn't feeling well and just wanted to get me fed so we could head up to the room. The empty restaurant should have been a sign, but I went for it because how much can you screw up noodles? Reception is always tough in casinos, so I didn't even try to check reviews.   I ordered Pad Thai, my husband ordered wonton soup. I'm not sure I even can even use words to describe how seriously awful the Pad Thai was. If I was blind folded I don't know that I would even know it was Pad Thai. My guess would be that it was leftover noodles from a chafing dish at a 10 year reunion the night before. The flavor was awful, the texture bizarre, as hungry as I was I could not even make myself choke this down. My husband's soup was almost edible if you avoided the wonton. So basically the broth was bland enough to force it down your throat in a pinch.  I so very rarely send food back, but this was inedible and expensive to boot! I kept trying to flag a server down, finally after 10+ minutes I went up to the hostess and said I needed either a manager or my server. When the server came over I started to explain why I didn't like it. He didn't seem surprised at all, just took it away and asked if I wanted something else. I decided not to subject myself to anything else from this place. We paid for the soup and then headed over to a small souvenir shop in the hotel. We grabbed a bag of pretzels and called it a night. Those Rold Gold pretzels were AMAZING after the slop we'd had here.  I don't think there is anything you could do to get me to eat here again. Even if it was free! Even if I was hungry and given the option of this or nothing, I think I would choose nothing every time. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!! Mandalay Bay should close this place down and open a good noodle place. Noodles are awesome when you have had a little too much Vegas fun, and even if the noodles were just average I think it would do very well! If you saw a picture of how tired this place looks, you would not even think this would be open inside Mandalay Bay. This place needs to go!",

We kindly requested to add an additional 3rd table... they gave us this dirty look wow.  Anyway, most of us got Pho, some of us got rice dishes and others some other noodle soup dish. The Pho was like $17?! What in the @#$%!! I anxiously waited for my Pho.... and it came 30 minutes later.... I do not know why it took them so long to slice up some beef, add the hot broth that should already be simmering in a huge pot, and some noodles.  The Pho wasn't even hot!!! It was lukewarm at best!! The beef wasn't even cooking thru!!! The whole bowl had like 4 slices of beef.... no meatballs, no tendons, no tripe. I didn't know you could mess up Pho, but this place did!

Everyone got something different and there was a lot of sharing and tasting around the table.  Every single one of us was happy with our food, another reviewer said that they would rather go to Panda Express and that just blows my mind.  The food at Noodle Shop was really well prepared and perfectly seasoned when we were there!  Some of the standouts from the evening include the Pad Thai (both shrimp and chicken) the Pho (expensive for Pho but tasty!), the eggplant, the black bean chicken and a tofu dish.  The lettuce wraps were tasty but the ones at P.F Changs are better (and I hate PF Changs).  The place is a little pricey but it's a restaurant in a casino in Las Vegas.  I don't think they were priced more than any similar places we saw and the food was MUCH better than most casino/hotel cafes I've been to.  I will definitely hit up the Noodle Shop again when I am in Vegas next.",

We ordered Mongolian Beef ($17.5), Hong-Kong Style Pan-Fried Noodles with Seafood ($18.5), Thai Iced Tea ($5.5), and house sparkling wine ($8).  The food was delicious and the right amount. My Pan-Fried Noodles were flavorful and I enjoyed every bite. My husband enjoyed his Mongolian Beef tremendously too.   We had a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupon for $25 off. Our bill came out to be $37.2. This is not a cheap place, but the food tastes good and it's convenient if you stay at Mandalay Bay.  We went back for dinner at 8:30 pm on Monday night. Again we were seated immediately. We shared Yang-Chow Fried Rice (with BBQ Pork and Shrimp, $14), and my husband had a Coke ($4).  The food was good and the waitress was attentive. The price of the meal is much friendlier this time.   Overall it's a solid Chinese restaurant. I took off one star because of the price. We will go back again if we stay at Mandalay Bay.",

They was no pao to this chicken.   I'd noodle past the noodle house and go to PF Changs down the street.",

Appetizers arrived before main courses and the food was mediocre at best.  I was positive that I'd been here 2-3 years ago and I'm sure I was at some version of the restaurant then but it looks like it moved and is now located in an annex of the cafe next door.  Funny how a bad atmosphere can make a meal feel cheap and that's what's happening at Mandalay Bay's Noodle Shop.",

It just didn't have a lot of flavor, from the chicken to the noodles - nothing.  The peanuts were the only saving grace of the dish.  I also shared a pairing of meats including ribs and duck.  The duck was a little dry but fairly good.  The ribs though good hardly had enough meat.  So it was pretty ok.  The white rice was good . . . .  Of course it's expensive, it's Vegas but the quality of food and service did not match the prices.",

My family and I came to the Noodle Shop during our stay in the Mandalay Bay because we wanted some noodles but did not want to leave the hotel. First off, the food is really expensive- $15 for only 4 small dumplings. We ordered only 4 individual plates and it came out $72, which would be fine if the food was good, which it was not. The food tastes like it was store bought and just microwaved, including the Orange Chicken and Chow Fun. The shrimp fried rice was not even fried and it seemed like they just added vegetables. The only thing that I thought was okay was the hot and sour soup, but that was $8 for a very small bowl. The customer service wasn't that great as well. Not recommended if you are looking for a good asian meal worth your money. I give it 2 stars because it is edible and the interior is nice.",

Sound great, right?  Reality .. a faint hint of coconut or curry, four medium shrimp hidden among the noodles and some \"balls\" of something.  With inquiry of our waiter, these were described as \"Fish Balls\".  This is considered ASSORTED SEAFOOD?  Really?!!  We asked for the manager to discuss the total mis-representation of this dish.

The atmosphere and vibe looked so depressing. Not a lot of asians customers.. which can be a thermometer on how good a place it is.. Greeted by everyone and workers were nice so service was not bad.   The funniest thing about this place is almost everything is upcharged. Found that out the minute we sat down. The older Asian man in the suit (presumably the supervisor ) passed by to hand out the menus. My friend wanted duck soup and some wontons added. He said,\"yes.. For extra charge\" as he continued to walk away. It was funny the way he said it. Looking at the menu his comment backs up the upcharge. Wanna opt for brown rice? 2.88 upcharge. Wonton added? 6 dollars for 3 wontons. Okay its vegas, nothings cheap.. So lets move on to flavor.  Had the ramen bowl. Noodle and broth tasted bland like instant ramen with some good pieces of pork. Friends duck soup was mediocre including the meat. The dried noodle dish (house signature dish on the last page) was good though.   I would not go out of my way to eat here (especially for the high cost). If u want soup I would highly consider eating elsewhere unless you desperate and have no pallete differentiating good vs bad soup and room credits.  2 stars for having toothpicks in front..",

Our waitress (Wendy was her name) went straight to getting our drink orders and then came back to take our food order. She was not personable and she may hate her job. She then came back with our food and that was the last we saw of her. She didn't ask us how anything was or if our drinks needed refills. I then went to go pay for the bill and was just wanting to get out by that time. The lady at the cashier desk asked us how it was and after explaining our experience, she just said that she would speak to her after her shift. No apologies and nothing offered to help. A discount would've been nice being that the food was way better at any other food court eaten while we were there. But seriously don't even waste your time!!!",

The BBQ Pork was so tasteful and perfectly cooked! Its probably the best BBQ Pork I've tasted.  The Customer Service was pretty good! Prices are a bit higher here for Chinese food. One thing I would complain about is the price for tea here. They charge $4.00 a person for hot tea? So we pretty much paid $8.00 for a pot of tea? Thats right! I guess thats the price you have to pay to eat at a Restaurant inside a casino.",

They're just shrimp and they added the title \"prawns\" to them so they can charge you $26 for 9 shrimps bedded with salad.  It's pretty expensive here so you're better off getting comp from the casino to eat.  That's what we did the second time and it was okay.   The food is \"not\" bad nor is it spectacular.  The best plate there is probably the Shrimp/Pork Dumpling for Appetizer.  It's only 6 bucks and I would order 3 of those with a few drinks and call it.  If you want tea then they'll charge you $2.50 for a cup.  This is the only place I have ever been to that charges you tea.  LOL.  This place is still surviving because it's the only Asian Restaurant you'll find that caters to Asian people in Mandalay Bay.  I can't hate it...  I just hate the prices!",

    "text": "On our last day in Vegas, everyone wanted to eat something different. As for me, I remember seeing the noodle shop, and having some hot noodle soup or chow mein sounded yummy after drinking all weekend. So, our group headed over to the noodle shop.  First off, the service is really really bad here. The service is slow, and half of the staff doesn't know what they're doing. Granted you don't get good service in a Chinese place, it was still worse than many other places. Our waiter just didn't care about anything, and never came back to ask how our food was or refill our water. On top of that, we wanted to split the bill at the end. So the way we usually do that, is write each person's last 4 digits of their credit card number and the amount they want to have charged on their card. At every restaurant, waiter's are please to see us make it so easy for them, and have it done right away. However, the staff here just couldn't figure it out. We waited a total of 20 minutes just to get our bill back. I noticed that there was about 4 people trying to handle the bill, and none of them could get it, so they finally had the manager come out. After the whopping 20 minutes, we finally got our bill back.  As for the food here, let's just say I much rather go to Panda Express for my Chinese food. I ordered chow mein, and it was soo bland and soo oily and greasy. I can't cook Chinese food for shit, and I could whip something better up.  Overall, I was really disspointed since I was craving some good , or even settle for decent, Chinese food. Good thing I went over to my aunt's house after and she made me some amazing Cantonese food.",

And is it still a lot more affordable than other Vegas options? Totally! I had the pho with white chicken meat and was more than happy with my option. My friend had a chicken dish and liked it as well. Looking for something a little less pricey in Mandalay, especially good comfort food, this will do the job.",

Then again, maybe I subconsciously wanted to pay a lot to eat blah food - being from LA, how did I expect this place, catering mainly to drunken tourists that have never had authentic bb chicken, to compare with the real stuff in LA? Also, I was particularly upset that I discovered the Burger Bar was also at Mandalay Bay right after eating here. I had been jonesing for a burger alllll night and specifically had my mind set on burger bar, but forgot which hotel it was in. On the bright side, my skimpy little shreds of chicken accompanied by a few bell peppers was probably a lot less caloric.",

It was enough for two adults actually. Thank goodness for our two kids we were able to order off the kids menu. We had the chicken fried rice and the chow mein- it was ok. Service is odd. The waiter only brought two soup bowls out when there were 4 of us at the table. The kids menu came with a drink and the staff only wanted to bring out one juice since they brought me a refill on my coke which I didn't ask for. Coke was 4 dollars. We asked them to bring out the two drinks since we had two kids and it came with the meal. At the end we asked for a to go container for the soup and they said they don't have any. So I guess if you order soup you can't take it to go? Weird. We just used our juice cup since the kids enjoyed the noodles and wanted it for later.  They gave us the kids menu which had coloring on it, but they only gave us one menu and  no crayons.   Some of the menu items are just outrageously priced.   Who pays 16.50 for fried rice and a lot of their single dishes like fish or beef were upwards of 24 dollars and up?    My kids did like the soup. The atmosphere and customer service of the staff is definitely lacking.",

If it wasn't for being hungover in Vegas and not wanting to move we would've left and had lunch somewhere else. My friend and I ordered Pad Thai, Chow Mein and Veggie Egg Rolls. I honestly could have had better if I just order Chinese take-out. The food was like cardboard, flavorless and unappetizing.   But enough about the food, it was the service that threw us over the edge. Not only did it take 15-20 mins for the server to greet us but after he brought us our food we never saw him again! We literally had to get up from our table at one point and search to pay our bill! I can't even remember if that's ever happened to me before. Overall it was one of the worst dining experiences I've had....ever.",

The other two entrees were orange beef, gummy and off tasting - a clump of meat on a plate without any type of sauce or garnish, and beef and vegetable low mein (chopsuey/fried noodle) which was extremely greasy with the only 'vegetables' being a generous handful of onions.  Yep, only onions.  We were half through the meal before the hot tea arrived.   I guess the most telling point was the waiter, who was fairly scarce,  NEVER asked how things were even when 90% of the food was uneaten.  My advice, go down to the food court and get Panda Express.

They are serving hotel guests, gamblers or show attendees. They probably don't really care about their Yelp reviews as much as a local, non-casino restaurant would.  With that said, I would go back if I was already on the property and wanted soup but I would never go to this place as a destination restaurant.",

We had to go take care of some business with the concierge and when we got back, our order was waiting for us.  We took it up to the room and enjoyed our noodles and TV (as God intended). The pad Thai was fantastic, and I am fully aware that it could be because I was starving, but either way, I enjoyed it very much. Mr. R. finished his dish and even had some of mine. I appreciate the Noodle Shop for being different from the other casual fare offered at Mandalay Bay, sometimes you have to take less than desirable noodles in order to get noodles at all.",

We decided to order the house special chow mein, BBQ combination platter, and the tonkatsu. I wasn't impressed at all with chow mein. It was bland and the noodles very wet. The BBQ combination platter had pork and duck meats. The flavor was very mild. Then there was the tonkatsu. Ramen is one of my favorite foods and I go to ramen bars regularly. This ramen was like your typical $1 Top Ramen. The broth wasn't the creamy pork broth. But the chasu was pretty good and a fair serving size.

We weren't able to check this place out last year when we came here, so there was no line this time and we were able to get seated pretty quickly.  Place looks nice, tables for small or large groups, nice booths etc. Menu had some good selections and a lot of items to choose from.    I wasn't super hungry so I was thinking I could get an appetizer or two instead of an entree. I noticed they had some appetizers and a small dim sum selection on their menu so I went with that. I got the Chinese BBQ Pork Bao and some steamed shrimp dumplings.    Pretty weak in my opinion. The BBQ Pork Bao I got was pretty average to below average, the BBQ was probably a day old and reheated, a little dry, steamed buns were a bit mushy and sticky so it was tough to stuff it when making your little sandwich. Comes with thinly sliced pickled cucumbers and some hoisin sauce.  Real basic looking, nothing fancy whatsoever at a high price. I didn't finish it.    The steamed dim sum shrimp dumplings (har gao) came last even after my coworker's lunch entrees were served, for some reason they said it takes longer because they have to steam it.  Uhhh....sure, ok. Not much flavor, skin was a bit gummy, the dumpling skin comes off easily, I added quite a bit of soy and hot sauce to it to give it some life.... it was mehhh.    My coworker's ordered some entree dishes like Kung Pao Chicken, I got a few bites because we close like that, good sized meal but at a high price, not the best cuts of chicken, not the most flavorful, it was just ok.    Service was fine, pretty attentive, but the food just wasn't all that at that high price. We've been to most of the restaurants at Mandalay and most of them are real good but this place we will probably pass on. We were in and out of there in about 40 mins, so I had some time to stop by the roulette table before our work meeting, so that was a good thing.",

    "text": "Traveling for work this week at the awesome city of Las Vegas, NV.  I had a little time in between meetings and venture out side of the food courts of Mandalay Convention Center and stumbled onto a cute Asian noodle restaurant called the Noodle Shop.  It was around noon and they had plenty of booths and tables.  The ambience was quite pleasant and reminded me of some of the Asian restaurants in Hong Kong.  We got seated right away but it took 10 minutes for the server to come back and take Drink and food orders.  Finally, the server came back and we ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen and the Beef noodle soup.  I splurged on an extra $3.00 up charge for the request of vegetables.  The soup was ok but not great for $20.00 of broth, pork belly, Raman noodles, and vegetable.  The broth was super greasy and was not as flavourful and I was hoping for.  The vegetables was a great selection.  The pork belly had zero flavours and a lot of fat.  I do not recommend getting the soup based on minimal flavours and a lot grease.  I am sure there were other amazing dishes that they could have executed better on but the noodle soup was not one them based on the name of the restaurant.  It took a good 15 minutes for the server to come back and give us our checks.  Based on the cost and the quality of food I do not recommend this place for a business lunch at the Mandalay Bay selection of restaurants.  Ambience was good and got me excited about the potential taste of the food.  Once the food arrived it did not spark my tastebuds.  The service was very slow despite the lack of customers in the restaurant.    I would like to try this place again in the near future in hopes that the chef would create a more delightful savoury Asian noodle bowl that resonates with the traditional cuisine of Asia.    They should change the name to something that would better meets the expectations of the food because noodle soup by far was not their expertise.",

    "text": "This was our last dinner after relaxing for a few days at Mandalay Bay. We came for an early dinner so we beat the dinner rush. Service was good and our server was efficient.   We had the pan-fried noodles with chicken, filet mignon with asparagus and an order of the tonkatsu Ramen. The meat entree came with only one small bowl of steamed rice but that was actually more than enough even with me grabbing a few spoonfuls every now and then.   My hubby's favorite is pan-fried noodles. So when we saw this on the menu we HAD to have it. There was just enough sauce to coat and soften the thin noodles without making it too soggy. The chicken was tender and the veggies were crisp.   The filet mignon and asparagus was light and delicious. The meat was tender and the asparagus was delicious and seasoned well.   The girls shared a bowl of Tonkatsu ramen. I wish the noodles were freshly made but it worked. The broth was good and went well with the mushrooms in it.   In the end, everything was eaten and there wasn't any leftovers. Definitely a good choice for us.",

The dim sum was ok some BBQ. The rest. Boring plain and no sauce except soy. Just 200% over priced!!!!  Wonton soup. Omg. I LOVE wonton soup. This was terrible. Fishy broth and mystery meat. I asked manager if it was fish broth and he said no. Chicken. Scared to eat it. Not kidding. Smelled like the Gulf of Mexico. Turned my stomach. I love ocean smell of salty air and fish but not in my chicken broth!!! My husband had a signature Chow Mein. Tasteless. Utterly bland. People, this was buffet quality, but worse.   Now as I write this, I'm still in the restaurant. The waiter was kind and sweet, front manager VERY VERY attentive. This was something Kitchen related. Food MUST be revamped into Great Asian food to redeem themselves. I have a very hard time believing that Mandalay Bay is ok with this. FIX IT. I DO NOT return food. I will however tell a manager why I did not eat the food. And we did NOT eat the food (we did eat dim sum but not entrees). He seemed upset we didn't let him make something new. We don't do that. We just do not. It was all not good so what was the point? Was it suddenly going to become great?  I had a myvegas 15$ discount and after complaining manager took 10$ off. Our bill for inedible food was still nearly 60$ (with tip) for two. No alcohol. And no food to speak of consumed. Unacceptable.",

    "text": "Think Kitchen Nightmares: Gordon Ramsay would shove his plate away in disgust, and exclaim, \"This is $%^!!\" I cannot stress enough how bad this food was. Like another reviewer, I saw the two stars and thought it can't possibly be that bad if it's in the Mandalay Bay. I was so wrong. It was terrible.  I wanted noodles but did not feel like walking or driving out of the hotel. Although the name would imply that there is a good selection of noodle dishes, this was not the case. It doesn't matter. Don't eat here. I ordered the vegetable spring rolls and the steamed pork and shrimp shumai. The waiter told me it would be about 20 minutes for the dim sum, so I agreed and thought it must be worth the wait. Nope. The shumai arrived in a stainless steel steamer basket, but it tasted like it had been defrosted in the microwave, then steamed for a minute or two for the sake of presentation. It was barely warm. It was a rubbery texture, and the \"meat\" was just plain awful. The spring rolls arrived looking perfect, and had a nice crunchy wrap. The insides, however, were tasteless mush. I realized that the perfect exterior was likely because they were straight off the frozen food shelves at Walmart.  My husband had the pad thai, and ordered it with chicken. The pad thai was mushy, bland and lifeless. It was a plate of sad noodles, spongy bean sprouts with a side of chopped peanuts.  Again, it appeared to be off the frozen food shelf at Walmart. The chicken cubes added to the dish were rubbery and apparently well past their frozen expiration date. My husband ordered a cocktail, with which he was satisfied, but he asked for a twist of lemon and instead received lemon chunks in his drink. I had the hot green tea, which was acceptable, but not a quality tea.  The female server stopped by and asked (n a heavy accent) how everything was; and as I spoke up to tell her my feelings about the food, she turned her head, all smiles, and walked away. The male waiter did the same thing. They appear to be practiced at this maneuver. Unfortunately, I am too polite to take my complaints any further, so we paid the outrageous bill and left.   The old joke about being hungry a half hour after eating Chinese food? Well, I was hungry before I even left the restaurant. The food was so bad, it was not worth the calories to eat it. I cannot stress enough: DO NOT EAT HERE. Go somewhere else; anywhere else.",

The only reason I had to go here was because someone in my party really wanted Asian food and this was the closest location.   I ordered the shrimp and pork wonton noodle soup which was not really that good. The broth itself was really bland and the wontons didn't have much flavor either. They were pretty much skimpy with the portions too. I wouldn't even pay more than $10 for this so it stung about my wallet and soul when I had to pay so much for this mediocre dish.   Overall I do not recommend going here. If you want good and cheap Asian food just get it from Chinatown. There aren't that many good Asian restaurants on the strip so stick with other cuisines in the meantime.",

I wanted to give the place a benefit of doubt since the food is of her native country. Maybe she was being a little harsh.   Gave it a try today since i had quite an alcohol-filled night, pho if you dont already know is the cure to everything. Wish i could say the service experience was the same as the other day.   Sat down for quite a while until a gent stopped by to see if i wanted anything to drink. This guy wasnt even my waiter, though i would have preferred him to be honestly. He took my drink order and chased down the guy who is supposed to be my waiter. I asked for fiji water because the vegas tap water tastes a little funny. Sure enough he brought out tap water. The gent from earlier saw this and kindly took it away apologizing for my waiter. Fiji arrives with a wet glass inside and out. It looked like the waiter dumped the cup and reused it, not caring to dry off any residue.   In short, stay away from the pho. Service is hit or miss. And i just got the bill without a pen.",

I got 2 shrimp, 2 scallops and 1 piece of white fish. Expected more for $26.   With so many other options in Vegas, it's safe to say I won't be coming back.",

It's like a giant airport, just expect to pay at a minimum double what you normally would for everything.  2. This place adds some variety. There's so many places that are just cafes/pizza places.  3. Their noodle soups are good.   The beef brisket soup was good and so was their wonton soup! Just don't venture far from the Chinese noodle soups. (I saw someone getting a pad thai there and it looked pretty bad... Also, their pho was mediocre at best...) All in all, my experience was 4-stars especially because this is exactly what my body needed.",

Noodles are hard and soup is generic and MSG tasting.  Thousand year old egg porridge- 2/5. Bland once again with small portion of thousand year old egg and a measly small sprinkle of green onions.  Mongolian Beef- 1/5. More like elementary school 'mystery meat mondays' for $20.  Lettuce mince meat wrap- 3/5. Okay tasting but small portions, more like a small appetizer.   High priced, but then again you are in Vegas so that's to be expected. But the quality is not good. It's much more worth it to drag yourself to a Pho place off the strip to cure that hangover.",

And it gets worse, and worse and finally - disaster!  First, I have to say that they have this incredibly amusing waitress who is any other Cantonese style Hong Kong restaurant, would be just as incomprehensible but alas...would only serve you great food, even if it was still moving when it arrived. Living in Hong Kong, I met plenty of ladies like this. And none would have ever remained in a job at such a terrible excuse of a Chinese restaurant. Even by Qwai Lo standards - this was a disaster.  We had a bunch of dishes. The fish was fishy in smell. The noodles - bland. The chicken tastes better in those free samples given out at shopping malls.   It was honestly one of the worst places I have eaten food at - period.  The hotel gave me a 100 dollar gift certificate after we complained about our 45$ meal. They own the Noodle Shop and if they ever bother to read their reviews, it is a real wonder why they don't switch up the chefs/staff and management - fast!",

You can always tell when a place is good when it's busy with patrons and it was, especially full of Asian customers! ;) This time I came in with the intention of ordering the crispy duck noodle soup which was delish! I forgot to request flat rice noodles instead of egg noodles but it was great anyway as the duck was meaty and perfectly cooked. The soup was more than enough especially for lunch. We had a lady named lua (I think) service our table, she was very friendly and attentive, she was quite endearingly cute! A little pricy but the restaurant was clean and didn't look cheap at all, nicely decorated with plants, mirrors, artworks and soft colours used. The toilets are clean and spacious! Free wifi available too. Always a place to visit when I'm in town!!",

Of course I read the Yelp reviews after I had been seated and was really nervous that I had made a poor choice.  I decided to go with simple menu items (how can they screw those ones up?) and avoided all the ones that were specifically reviewed as bad.  I went with the chicken satay to start and the Thai curry chicken as an entree. The chicken satay came out and was ok. The peanut sauce it was served with tasted more of taco seasoning (your guess is as good as mine on why) and was not a nice creamy peanut sauce. It wasn't bad, just not what I was expecting.  The Thai curry chicken was a generous portion. The chicken was a strange texture (boiled, maybe?) but tasted ok. The red and green peppers with it were fresh and pretty crispy still. The sauce had some yellow curry in it but not quite enough. The flavor was weak but the spice level was strong. The dish was ok. Not great and not terrible.  All in all, I probably wouldn't eat here again but it's not quite as bad as some of the other Yelp reviews -- at least not with my experience tonight.",

They were understaff and could not handle the lunch crowd.  Even though I saw 5 empty tables, the wait line was long and moved very slowly.  I ordered chinese tea (without looking at the menu) first thing we sat down.  Hey, that's how the Cantonese do it!  My sister asked for a pot of hot water.  We ordered the Roast Duck Noodle Soup since it was their signature dish.  We also ordered the HK Pan-Fried noodle with seafood.  The Japanese seaweed salad was also ordered.  I got my pot of tea with one tea cup.  The waitress brought my sister a mug with hot water with this comment - \"this is not Hong Kong.  And we don't have enough tea pots to go around\".  We looked around and only a few tables had teapots on them.  So they have 4, 5 teapots serving the entire restaurant?  Hmmmm.  During the meal my sister wanted to try my tea so we asked for a tea cup.  Our waiter forget and we had to asked again.  I wish we had also forgotten.  On the check we were charged 2 teas.  We spoke with the manager and he told us the tea is $5 PER PERSON. We DID NOT get 2 pots of tea!  A good manager would have comp the $5.  It's only $5 for them.  It's a rip off.  When the waiter brought the second cup, he should have informed us that cup is actually going to cost us $5.  When they insisted on charging us $5, they lost 2 customers and all others who would read this review.  Can you imagine a family of say 6 ordering tea?  That would be $30 on their bill.  And it's the same amount of tea leaves that goes into that teapot.  Not like they would get 6 teapots.  If your family wants tea, order 1 and bring some cups with you!   On to the food - A good cantonese noodle is al dente.  The noodles we got was super soft / overcooked.  The Roast Duck itself was excellent.  Advise - order the Roast Duck alone, but with rice or another kind of noodle which cannot be overcooked like mei fan or hor fan.  Japanese seaweed salad - didn't taste right.  Something was off with the sauce.    The pan fried noodles was the bomb.  The portion of seafood was generous.    For food I would give 3 stars.  But the high price, the tea charge rip off and the not up to par customer service gets 1 start.",

It was all delicious and the offered sauces added additional savor. The broths in each soup were the epitome of comfort food bliss and the dim sum was so good - we would go to the Noodle Shop for lunch, snack, or late night dinner. You can't go wrong. Service was pleasant and quick and no one seemed annoyed that we were last minute customers.

It is a large place sharing the seating/dining area with the Seaside Cafe formerly The Raffles Cafe.  Don't expect a window seat with a view as there are none available.  What you should expect is a pricey meal with extreme deliciousness.  I ordered the won ton soup with salt and peppered prawns and fried calamari.  All were delicious and prepared to perfection.  The won ton surprisingly had noodles, never seem this before but it was really good.  The salt and peppered prawns were perfectly fried and were so moist.  Same with the calamari.

    "text": "I was chilling at Mandalay Bay when I walked by the Noodle Shop. Thought I'd give it a try. I got the pork belly boa and the duck soup. The pork belly was made with nice flavor but the garnishes to add to the boa was lacking. The duck in the soup had good flavor but was a little dry. I think if I got the duck fresh it would have been better. Good thing for the soup, so I shredded the duck off the bone and into my soup. Over all it tasted like it met the basic flavors of Chinese food but didn't have that bang that would make the food unique. The service was great. Everyone pitched in like a team. It did not matter if you were a server, bus boy, hostess, manager, everyone was pitching in serving and cleaning and checking on the customers.",

It was around $22 just for your reference - which is not bad compared to a lot of the local restaurants!",

I was impressed with the ambiance, but then I thought to myself, this must be expensive chinese food to be this nice!   The restaurant is spacious and I was surprised there was a lot of people dining here. We were led to a table, and our drinks were provided. I ordered the house special chow mein to share. When I received it, the noodles looked good, but the taste was lackluster. I had to add soy sauce to provide more flavor to the noodles.   I didn't try the other items we ordered because I was craving noodles. My entree did its job filling me up, but disappointed the noodles lacked in flavor.",

    "text": "DO NOT COME HERE.  Despite the low ratings, I had some faith that it \"wouldn't be that bad.\"  Boy, was I wrong!!!  I can deal with over priced, slow service in Vegas. That is an expectation I am willing to look over, but I cannot stand for the principle behind what happened to us that night and how poorly it was handled.  We were not some drunk people sobering up either, just innocent hungry victims trying to find some comforting soup.    We ordered a beef brisket soup to share.  The price was somewhere in the $16 range.  Fine. Whatever.  But when I was eating my soup, I choked on a plastic wrapper!  It looked like the wrapper from the top of a brand new soy sauce? bottle.  We immediately notified the waiter and I showed him the foreign object found in my food.  He apologized and got us a new soup (what? they CAN bring out food fast?).  He said he couldn't comp it since we only ordered 1 item but we could get 50% off, which made me feel a bit better.    Then at the end of the meal when we got our bill, we only got 15% off.  I questioned this and he said he told us about the 15% discount. This man did have an accent, which I could have misunderstood but I am sure he initially said 50%.  He then insisted that nothing further could be done because we only ordered ONE item.  I couldn't understand this logic.  Why could nothing be done about the current meal and situation at hand?  Frustration to the max.  TL;DR IF YOU CHOKE ON A PIECE OF PLASTIC FOUND IN THE ONE BOWL OF SOUP YOUR ORDERED,  YOU WILL GET $2.50 OFF YOUR BILL AND NOTHING MORE",

After reading your reviews and getting more and more horrified that our dinner is going to be an expensive disappointment, we decided to not order the noodle soups which was the target of most of the bad reviews. Instead we went with the      SEAFOOD STIR-FRY SUPREME (Lobster, Scallops and Prawns) which we asked to be made spicy and the HOUSE SPECIAL CHOW MEIN (Shrimp, BBQ Pork, Chicken and Onions Wok-Fried with Soy Sauce).   Both turned out to be excellent.   We are both Chinese and believe me, I was ready to give a terrible review but we were pleasantly surprised with the food.  The service was great as well.",

My friend ordered the beef satay and I got the Hong Kong won ton noodle soup. I've had better, but for under $12 it hit the spot. The broth lacked any of the subtle nuances that you can get with ramen broth, but the won tons had generous amounts of shrimp (and not much else). My friend thought her beef satay was way too sweet. Service was well, True to what I call \"Asian restaurant service\"--they bring you your food and leave you alone. I rarely tip 15% nowadays but here is where it may be justified. The reason why this place exists is because Vegas attracts a lot of Asian gamblers and if they're like my parents, they would prefer to eat Asian food. Heed my advice and do not eat here if given the choice. A better meal awaits you somewhere else.",

I ordered the sea bass congee, and it was pretty basic. A few green onions. Small sea bass pieces. No Chinese donut. No century egg. The problem here is the price. For what it is, way too much to recommend. The congee itself was fine but not spectacular enough to justify the price of $17+. Do not plan on coming back, but I do plan on having some better, cheaper congee soon.",

The servers were snotty when I asked for coffee, he  said \" we are a Chinese restaurant, no we don't have coffee\" umm funny because every other Chinese restaurant has it. No big deal. Then we waited a good ten minutes just to order. When my boyfriend asked the server if they had crab Rangoon's the waitress snickered and said no. It's not nice to be rude. If the answers are no then fine but snarky comments and snottiness need not be applied when we are spending our money!! Right then I knew we should have left but we were hungry and already went this far. Then the food arrives. My boyfriend ordered the Spivey pad Thai, I  had vegetable stir fry. I added the chicken which was an extra $8!!!! Our food was so bland. I never add spice but this needed something. The flavor was completely missing. This restaurant is the worst Chinese food place I've ever been to in Vegas. You'd think Mandalay would have removed them and not renew the lease by now. It doesn't belong in Mandalay much less any where else in Vegas really. Rude staff, terribly long wait to actually be served, and horrible food. Way over priced for the quality. Do yourself a favor and go to one of many other places inside Mandalay, you'll thank me later. I wished I would have checked yelp before coming here.",

Roasted duck noodle soup cured my sinus prob.The flavors were great and the duck was amazing.It really helped bring out the duck flavor in the broth as well. I also ordered the seaweed salad.

You know that ominous feeling like you're just another digit versus maybe a repeat paying customer? Yes that feeling, like asking to get more menus for all of the people in the party? Isn't that restaurant 101 or were they that short on counting fingers to figure it out! The menu: typical choices you would find at all fast food \"Chinese\" take out. Flavor: tasted like the typical \"Chinese\" food from any average casino buffet. I say that because we were staying at Mandalay Bay and went to Bayside Buffet and the \"Chinese\" items were that much better! We had a fairly big party of 14 people, but there was maybe another 3 little parties in the restaurant the whole time we were there. 6 o'clock Saturday on Easter weekend. This place was empty, the service was lacking, you had to ask for everything (refill, napkins, etc). With a handful of workers just standing on the side wall coming from the kitchen, they should've been more attentive to a big party. The only item that was half decent was the Beef/Broccoli only because it was the only entree that came out like it was made to order and was somewhat hot. Everyone's meals were room temperature or looked undercooked. Everything was BLAND! Makes you wonder who cooks and manages this place in a nice Hotel like this. The second star is because the place was clean, other than that all negative reviews are True about this place. I for one would never recommend it no matter the convenience because you'll be paying the average price of $16-19 an entree, where your average good Chinese restaurant you would pay about half across the board. Service :1 Food:2 Price:1   You get the picture, avoid, avoid!",

So this year, I'm sitting there with my friends like always, we've had too much to drink like always, and we go to the noodle shop to get some food in us before we go to bed like always.  And finally, after so many years, it dawned on me....this place sucks.  The food is very bland even if you add 15 spoonfuls of hot sauce.  The service is insanely slow even though you can clearly see the servers standing around, talking to eachother, and always exchanging lots of pieces of paper.  The paper exchange thing is lame and annoying and I realized, in my booze induced haze, that this noodle place has been this way every single year.  I'm serious when I say, it is consistently mediocre.  The table is never completely set, you always have to ask for hot sauce or soy sauce.  The whole damn place is using hot sauce and soy sauce but you still have to ask for it.  What's the deal with that?  Last but not least, the prices are absolutely insane.  $19 for a bowl of noodles?  I miss the good old days when every hotel casino had a 24 hour coffee shop where you could get good food for next to nothing.  Screw this place, I don't care how hungry I am, I'm never going here again.",

Got the roast pork (cha chiu), Chinese broccoli  and steamed rice.  Well, I got it like 35 minutes after I ordered it.....  I was kinda pumped to see they had some of my favorites, but I have to say it was pretty bland.  The cha ciu was not sweet enough, and there was little-to-no brown sauce to add flavor. The Chinese broccoli was blanched properly, and had a drizzling of oyster sauce on it----but that only gives flavor to the lucky broccoli that got the sauce.  Again, if you are in need of a real Chinese fix, this joint isn't the top choice.  Head over to the Spring Mountain Rd area...",

The pan seared pork (and shrimp) dumplings were very good, but the Pad Thai shrimp fell short. We weren't quite sure what was going on with it, but as my friend noted, \"why is it so orange?\" might have been one thing. The shrimp were definitely frozen and beyond small, over cooked, etc.  Stick with the dumplings, steer clear of the Pad Thai shrimp.",

We asked how big the portions were and our waitress couldn't even tell us, she didn't know. She just said, \"order your food, if not enough, order more\". Once we got our appetizers, they were extremely small. There was not enough for even two of our five party members to eat. We ordered pad thai, which was actually good but they brought us toppings to put on it and there were jalapeno and habanero. We were not told that there would be such spicy peppers. One of our party members is allergic and did not realize they were the spicy kind. She started choking and had to spit it out. We talked to the manager in the end and she made light of the whole situation. All in all, my biggest concern was the major language barrier and the lack of knowledge of the employees.",

It's comparable to a PF Changs, maybe.    I would probably never pay full price to eat here, I had a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupon that I used to get $25 off.  We had the sweet and sour chicken and the mongolian beef.  Both plates were solid and tasty.  Portions are just right and respective sauces were good.    At the end of the meal, what was supposed to be a $40 meal after taxes and tip, came out to $15.  I felt a little bad since service was great, so I just tipped a bit more.    I will probably be back next time I'm in Vegas, but i will be coming armed with a coupon.",

Servings: More than enough for one, unless you always eat supersized meals. Presentation: Nothing fancy, just straight out good food. Taste: We've ordered a few of their dishes and no bad words were spoken, well except that their China tea which cost like a mother... The beef tenderloin noodle i had was delicious.  Wait: It was fast, our food was served in the nick of time after we ordered, like fast food, except the food tasted better than we expected.   Not a fan of noodle houses though. This place ain't that bad if you're craving for hot soup after getting buzzed.",

When we asked the waiter to split the check , he made a big deal about it and gave us a scolding look and told us that we should have told him earlier. BUT HOW ARE WE SUPPOSE TO KNOW?!  No one told us ahead of time and all places let you asked for split checks at the end!   Ridiculous. Don't come here. The waiter watched us write down how much tip we were giving him...he lingered behind us. And then picked up the receipt as soon as we put the pen down and stared at the tip amount in front of us and walked away without saying anything to us.   So rude! Never coming back here!!! I think he might have also been the manager. Unbelievable.",

I must admit the seaweed salad was weird. I had a very strong, almost putrid aftertaste but I highly recommend the pho. It was probably the best pho I've ever had. The broth is amazing and they give you all of the sides. If you are craving something healthy and you don't mind the atmosphere I would definitely recommend this place. The atmosphere is kind of dull and boring but the soup is amazing. Did I mention that? Also, the service was outstanding. We had the sweetest, most helpful gentleman serving us. I stay at Mandalay Bay a lot and I always wanted to try this place. Its pho-king yummy!",

If my friends got sick, I wish at least I could say the food was good. IT WAS NOT! The food was not flavorful and noodles fell flat.  Some of our soups came out lukewarm.  The price of the food here too is completely ridiculous.  I understand that everything is a little overpriced in Vegas but COME ON! You are charging almost $20 dollars for poor quality pho?  You are better off gambling $10 dollars on slots and getting a burger and fries at McDonald's. At least then you would be decently full, maybe make some money, and still have your faculties about you to enjoy the rest of your day.  The one shining star was that the wait staff was super friendly and attentive. Unfortunately, this was not enough to overlook the poor quality and overpriced food here.",

We ordered the fried rice, beef chow run, and dim sum platter. To start off, everything is overpriced, but that is fairly typical on the strip. The fried rice was very bland. The beef chow fun was too salty. Nothing seemed to be going right.  Then, it got worse. We were told the dim sum sample platter for 2 would take 15 min to arrive. It took way longer. It consisted of 8 pieces shumai/ dumplings and 2 pork buns. For $30, I was expecting a bit more. To top it all, everything was disgusting. The dumplings were rubbery and everything else look liked it had been dyed with food coloring. After eating 2 pieces, we couldn't take it anymore and stopped.   I've never had such a bad asian dining experience before. I didn't expect authentic food at a hotel in vegas, but I definitely never expected to encounter such a dining experience. Ever.",

It definitely was NOT a good idea. Why? 1) Super salty 2) Expensive 3) Peking duck was HORRIBLE  Ordered: 1) Peking duck: 1/5 HIGHLY DO NOT recommend this dish. This was the worst dish on the table. It tasted like peking duck you would pick up at a fast food joint.  2) Spicy garlic beef: 1/5 way, way salty 3) Beef Chow fun: 3/5 this was the only dish on the table that was edible.",

There is actually good stuff there.  But this place actually has very good and authentic Chinese food.  I've been to China about 30 times, so I know Chinese food reasonably well.  This is the real thing, not the gloppy stuff to which most Americans are accustomed.  That may be why some of the reviewers were turned off.  Plus, don't order chow mein!  That is not even Chinese.  Order the noodle soup, the steamed chicken, the steamed fish -- these are the real deal.  I was happy with my meal and would go back.",

We ate here out of convenience - needed a place before the Michael Jackson Cirque show (which is amazing, btw). All the reviews for this place are True. The food is mediocre at best - on par with food court Asian at triple the cost. Service was not good.   All in all, it wasn't the worst dining experience ever, but it's expensive not good food with lackluster service. Skip it.",

(E.g., Closed due to remodeling, closed due to water main break, closed due to stars alignment with Jupiter, etc..)  Anyway, I finally had a chance eat at the Noodle Shop and we weren't disappointed.  My daughter Muff, sister Luch and I were exhausted and broke after spending the day at the Fashion Show Mall.  We barely dragged ourselves back to the hotel and decided to eat before we went to our rooms. (We said that if we could make it to our rooms, we were NOT leaving.  And the previously checked out room service menu didn't strike our fancies.) We perused the menu and here's what we ordered: *  Shumai,  *  Singapore-Style Fried Rice Noodles with Shrimp and Pork *  Shrimp, Beef and Chicken with Garlic Sauce; *  BBQ Pork with Mixed Vegetables  Only four dishes with rice and enough to feed a family of moose!  Everything was delicately flavored and wonderful.  I love garlic, but it can easily overpower any other flavor in its path.  It was present and accounted for in my Shrimp, Beef and Chicken with Garlic Sauce but not overly so.  My sister's Singapore-Style Fried Rice Noodles with Shrimp and Pork was also delicious.  And my daughter Muff's BBQ Pork with Mixed Vegetables was simple yet enchanting.  And the freshly made Shumai was delightful. We had a scrumptious lovely meal to end our day of shopping madness.",

The food is tasty without the MSG overload of most Asian places.   Overall, the quality seems fresh and the service is thankfully prompt and friendly. Everything is on the pricier side so be prepared or head to one of the many Chinese restaurants along Spring Mountain Road.",

The waiter assured me that the stir fry veggies would be mostly steamed.  I asked him for seasoned chicken to be added, but not oil or caloric sauces.  Our food arrived in less than five minutes.  My food was drenched in a brown sauce, but the chicken tasted very blah as if no seasonings were added.  My husband said his Kung Pao Chicken tasted Americanized.  It looked like the same sauce that I had, but thicker.   I also had a medium length black hair in my food.  We didn't complain at the time, unfortunately, but it was a very disappointing meal.",

It's mainly all Chinese food and then you have random dishes from other Asian ethnicity like Pad Thai or Pho so maybe a non Asian person can come in and not see any difference in taste or care much, but for us Asians we are somewhat critically with the food we grew up with.

Still, it was edible and all fine. The beef chow fun was the same experience... Ok / not great, pretty salty but still pretty edible.  SERVICE. Good actually! They checked in fairly often to see how everything was and if we needed anything else. No complaints.

I tried the seaweed salad with deep fried tofu, seafood wonton soup, and roasted duck/ BBQ pork combo.. The BBQ pork was decent but only had about four bites with the serving.. Totally overpriced $18.... The ice teas were like $4 bucks and of course  you gave to pay for a \"small\" side of steamed rice...

It was strong garlic and soy sauce flavors. Rice was on dry side... Hong Kong Style Pan Fried Noodles w/ Sea Food was tasty. It was over $50 just for food...",

Now I understand why it's expensive cuz its a hotel rest. but damn at-least make ur pho better..We also ordered pad Thai and it wasn't good. If you want to get pho go to Chinatown in Vegas it's way better and cheaper. It's not that far. Customer service sucks at this place too. Came here cuz we were in a rush.

I wounded why... So I by pass looking at the tips and reviews that everyone wrote so I can give this place a fair chance.  So soon as we put our name on the list we waited only for about 5 mins. Okay, that is cool place didn't seem so bad. Right? Place look clean, got seat away from everyone else so it was a nice family style of five. Then this is when the stars kept on falling here... We waited for ten mins for the server to get us water and our orders to be put in. We had to flag some manger to get someone to attend to us.   Now comes the good part dinner. We order fried calamari, pancake, and BBQ pork. Out of the three the BBQ pork was the best. The pancake was too powdery too me. And the calamari it was all batter! Horrible. As for our main course the duck soup with noodles was bland. Shrimp fried rice was okay but lucky for me they had sriracha  the house special noodles was okay but again sriracha is needed again.  To sum it all up, come here for BBQ pork. If you really have too. I mean if you have no where else to go and your super hungry. Other than that if you still have the power to wait else where to eat then go somewhere else. This was not worth the money or time to try.",

The pork, chives and shrimp dumplings had a solid amount of meat in it with a light dumpling skin.  Only 4 of them but so delicious.  The chow mein was so great especially at 10:30pm at night.  Both hostesses who took my order were very friendly and my food was ready within 10 min.  We got Togo a second time because I knew my daughter wanted it again.

Friend said the soup was good, the seaweed salad was solid - right amount of sweet and sour, good variation in types of seaweed, yum - only downside was it was sort of warm.  Noodle dishes were not good. Singapore noodles were bland and very, very dry. Like sawdust dry. Tasted like they just mixed together rice noodles, curry powder, and oil. No delicious vegetables, just a few slices of onion, a few measly pieces of BBQ pork, and like 6 baby shrimp. Beef noodles were similarly bland, tasting of nothing but soy sauce. Thank goodness we added the broccoli because that's what was picked out and eaten.  Would not eat here again.",

Located just off the casino floor in the Mandalay Bay resort, it is designed in a simple, and modern style.  The menu is a mix of Chinese, Thai and other dishes. However, if you are looking for True Thai dishes, this is not going to meet your desires. Lots of rice and noodle dishes, which are great to cure a case of the beer (or wine, or bourbon) flu.  Since I was suffering from a strain of the Guinness-Jameson blight, I chose a hot Green Tea and the Roast Duck noodle soup. This was the perfect cure. The duck was excellent, perfectly cooked, perfectly done meat, with a little bit of fatty skin.  The broth complimented the duck perfectly.  It also had some noodles and a little veg, though I wish there were a little more of the greens added.  My wife  had the Tom Yum Thai soup. Good but not really Thai style, missing elements like the lime and the sour style that is common.  When suffering from the 'flu' it is best to have a spicy dish. The hot bean paste condiment is excellent. Nice roasted and smoky flavor. It does pack a wallop.  The price was right and the service was quick and efficient, and friendly. The General Manager stopped by, asked about our meal and when asked, he gave us a little education on the pending Chinese New Year.  A very nice touch.",

I ended up getting the chicken lettuce cups as an appetizer and the Hong Kong style noodles with seafood.  The chicken filling was well made with a nice mild sweetness it.  The water chestnuts were chopped and crisp.  As a difference there was some pine nuts mixed in which was a nice crunch and flavor.  Chicken was moderate, but nothing special.  Disappointingly the dish came with only 3 leaves of lettuce for the dish, much too few.  The other problem was that they served it with ROMAINE lettuce, not much of a cup or able to wrap it up.  Poor choice of lettuce type.  Hong Kong style noodles were not freshly made, they were standard type thick noodles.  Not exactly pasty but pretty close.  The fish in the seafood was cold and flat tasting with a bit of gristle.  The shrimp was well seasoned and prepared but that was the only highlight of the dish.  Overall the dish was a bit oily and disappointing.  While I understand that the food would be a bit more expensive because of the location in the casino it was way overpriced considering the quality of the food.  The dishes were of low quality compared to what I would expect at Vegas in a casino.  I avoided this place during the remainder of my trip and would not return.",

I'm giving it 4 Stars because of the Roasted Duck soup, and the service was friendly. 5 Stars are for the \"OH MY GOSH!\" places. While good, this wasn't one of those.    I think the reason people aren't giving this place better reviews is because they are used to their hometown Chinese joint, which I get, and because it's Vegas and it's pricier than their hometown too! LOL.  We loved it!  It tastes like Sam Wo's in SF, CA! Which I LOVE!  My sister ate here as well with us, and we've literally been craving the place, and my sister is SUPER picky with food!  So, there is my opinion!  I love it.",

I was unpleasantly greeted with a line, however, I was delirious due to hunger so I waited. (I did notice like, 5 empty tables waiting for seats, but the this place was REALLY understaffed)  I sat and ordered Thousand year old egg with shredded pork congee. My mother ordered wonton mein, and my sister ordered... pot stickers?  This place was a mix of different kinds of asian cuisine, I managed to find a red bean beverage and pad thai (not chinese food) So this place could be your fix for all sorts of asian cuisine. The staff understood cantonese, so they're authentic and my entree seemed legit. The congee was super flavorful but it was WAY thick... I'm not saying I like watery congee, but this was like pudding thick. Anyways, the pork was a tad salty, but overall, the congee was really good. My mom seemed content (not stoked) about her wonton mein and my sisters pot stickers looked like fried sui mai.  or not pot stickers of any sort, to be honest.  I liked this place a lot, if the service was better, I'd consider coming back within the same trip.. maybe, the price was very off putting though.",

    "text": "My husband and I are foodies and enjoy trying new restaurants. This experience started with a martini that was watered down with vegas tap water. He sent it back because he couldn't drink it (he has never met a drink he didn't like, btw). We decided to go with the appetizer menu and ordered the calimari and dim sum sampler. The calimari came out first. It was under seasoned and under cooked. We wanted to send it back, but were afraid after already sending back a drink. The dim sum platter came and it looked decent. It was alright until we got to the shumai. This is my husband's favorite. It tasted like a barn animal's a**hole. My husband actually spit it out. And we refer to him as the human garbage disposal. I have never seen him spit food out. Ever. Additionally, their spicy mustard was watery. My husband asked our waiter if it was watered down. The waiter admitted it was and said it was because they made it with powdered mustard. Our final bill was $79 which included a diet Pepsi and two drinks.",

But, there are lines, there are tons of people who want to be here all the time, and the place is small.   XO string beans. They have an asparagus thing that is pretty good. Their Pho is so-so. Eggplant is pretty good. Its all good. Its all very very expensive.",

    "text": "Oddly, for all the negative hype of this place, and the ridiculous price tag (and I'm talking ridiculous - I think we paid the same amount here as we did the Border Grill, and that's a signature restaurant while this one is labeled \"casual\" by Mandalay Bay), the food was actually pretty tasty.  I think the expense has to do solely with the fact that this is Vegas we're talking about - anywhere people can be bilked to fork over change, whether it be for fois gras or a plate of fried rice, it's going to happen.  That all being said, my potstickers and chow fun were tasty and came out of the kitchen hot.  I was satisfied and pleasantly surprised.  If you're stuck in Mandalay Bay and are craving asian, this is fine by mid-level standards.",

    "text": "It's been more than a week since I was here, but having just found the receipt from this restaurant in my wallet I felt it appropriate to warn all tourists to not eat here.  The Mrs. and I ordered soup and noodle entrees (Won Ton and BBQ Pork) which were tasty, but definitely not worth the $17.95 and $12.25 we paid. A few Thai Iced Teas later we were looking at close to $50 for two people eating soup for lunch. I understand the rules of traveling, especially when you go to Las Vegas. You'll normally spend $10 for every mixed drink and $8 for every beer. That's just how it works and it's fine if you get good food and great service, but that's not what we got.  I'm not sure if it was how we looked or dressed but our server \"Wendy\" was rushing us the entire time. She kept checking to see if we were done with our soup and kept peaking from behind the exit to see how much longer we'd be eating. Another server came by and tried to take our bowls when we weren't even done. They didn't even leave us an option for desert as Wendy rushed the bill to our table. For mediocre-good food, this place had poor service. I couldn't understand why they wanted us out so quickly, it's not like this place was busy at 2:51pm on a weekday afternoon.   In Summary: The food was good, the tea was fine, the prices were inflated and the service was awful. Instead, go to the Chin-Chin restaurant at New York New York Hotel & Casino for amazing Asian food and top notch service with reasonable prices.",
