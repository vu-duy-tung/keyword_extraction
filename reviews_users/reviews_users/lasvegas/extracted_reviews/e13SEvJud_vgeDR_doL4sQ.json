One of our guys had said this place was good a couple nights before, so we had our final dinner here as a group. What a great choice! I Yelped once we were seated to see what other folks recommended, and saw a guy who recommended the chile relleno. Oh. Em. Jeezy. Such a good call. The grilled poblano pepper came stuffed with chopped skirt steak and a mix of potatoes, carrots, tomatoes, onions and cilantro. They topped it off with a Mexican cheese blend, sour cream, and fresh avocado. This was all served over a tostada (like a smaller corn tortilla) covered in pasilla salsa (which tasted like a mole), with a side of rice and beans (the beans were a version of pinto, cooked with bacon and chipotle sauce).   Everyone's meals were great: burritos, tacos.   We didn't indulge in the margaritas because we had Fat Tuesday plans afterward, but next time foooorrrrr surrrrrre.  Best meal I had in Vegas.",

Surf and Turf fajitas with Carne Asada and gulf Shrimp, sizzling in a chimichuri and citrus marinade are off the hook! Street style \"Elote\" is amazing too and free when you check in! If you're in Mandalay Bay, go here. Happy hour and football specials look like a bargain too but not available on Saturdays, next time.",

The salsa, on the other hand was tasty which made the former fact a real shame. We left them untouched. Unheard of.  Food was just okay. Same as the service. I ordered the vegan chile relleno with gardein beef tips. My friend ordered the vegan quesadilla, which came on a single medium tortilla served open faced?  I wasn't a huge fan of the rice and I love my rice. There was a lot going on on the plate, flavor-wise my dish should have been exploding. The flavor just wasn't there especially having had such delicious Mexican in southern Colorado. My avocado slices were not even ripe. It was hard not creamy as a good, ripe avocado should be.  I did like the beans.  Pay attention to things like how busy the place is... follow the crowd. Better off going to Slice of Vegas a few doors down where it's busy for good reason and you are sure to be impressed.",

And then they brought out three kinds of huge salsa bowls to go with it! I think I have photos... anyway, it was all delicious.   And a VEGAN MENU! Yesssssss! It's pretty hard to find a vegan-devoted selection at any mexican spot where we're from. I got the vegan breakfast burrito which had faux chorizo and faux eggs. So amazing. And adding the guac on it - woo.   I definitely love this place. And I'm glad there will be so many opportunities for us to come back, since our wedding ceremony is going to be at Mandalay Bay next year.",

The corn came but it was cold like it just came out of the fridge but we were hungry so we just ate it. My kid did not eat his though . My wife ordered a burrito and I ordered the chimichanga and When we received our food we both noticed that it was cold.. In all fairness the food did not taste bad just temperature wise it was not good. Waiter never came back to check on us or for refill our waters, Finally had had enough called manager over and told him the problem he was cool enough to comp one of the burritos and take the corn off the bill all in all bad experience",

My niece celebrated her 21st birthday dinner here last night, aside from the fact that you can barely have a conversation because the mariachi band is playing the whole time in the small confined restaurant. Several of my parties orders were incorrectly prepared, salmon was overcooked but requested as medium rare, one of the meals was requested to come without beans and it showed up covered in refried beans. We then asked the waiter to just remove it from our order because at this point we weren't interested in waiting any longer, however they still tried to charge us $20 for it.  My cheese enchiladas tasted like they rolled a string cheese into a quesadilla and served it = $16. They charge $20 for a burrito and an extra $8 to add Carne Asada meat. We had a total of eight people for our party so they automatically add gratuity to each check. Smh! This place does not uphold Las Vegas reputation or standards, very disappointed.",

    "text": "The original Hussong's in Ensenada claims to have invented the margarita. Hussong's Las Vegas actually has a vegan menu. These two factors are what prompted us to give this place a try on a Sunday afternoon.  We weren't hungry enough for full meals, so we sat at the bar. We decided to share a Stacked Quesadilla. I wasn't driving home so I ordered a margarita.  I don't know if they would recognize this quesadilla in Baja, but it was surprisingly tasty. If you've never tried Gardein Chick'n Strips, they taste remarkably similar to crispy fried chicken. I'm not sure what else was so flavorful (maybe the Pico de Gallo?) but we were both happy with the quesadilla and I would definitely order this again.  I also don't know how the margarita would pass muster. I got the Original, which came in a pint glass instead of a margarita glass. Is this how they serve them in Ensenada? Not bad, but I've had better. They claimed to use Sauza Blue Reposado tequila and fresh squeezed lime juice. If True, I could have used more tequila. Maybe I'm spoiled by my own margaritas. It was pretty refreshing, though, and deceptively strong. Maybe I'll try a Cadillac or El Pepino next time.  Thanks, Hussong's, for serving Gardein products. Vegan Mexican food isn't easy to come by, and you do it right!  Suggestion: serve some dishes with soyrizo!",

Inattentive and seemed to have a high level of anxiety as he was literally sweating more than what looked comfortable.   Took 12 minutes just to come around and introduce himself and take the drink order. Got the drink order wrong. We didn't get chips and salsa until  after was asked post-appetizer.   Overall long periods of not checking back and overall non-attentiveness to the customer. It was easy to spot out the manager on duty who was carelessly walking the floor and chatting with the female staff with little care or attention to the problem areas.   Not the best show for a restaurant of such high traffic on a Friday night.",

All the appetizers were done very well.  Our group then ordered various tacos which were all very tasty...some of the standouts were the rib eye, carne asada, pork belly, and baja shrimp.    One person got the chicken nachos which were huge and smothered with cheese-they were tasty.  Our server was attentive, nice and helpful...his name was Luis.  We would definitely eat here again.",

I ordered the vegan chile relleno stuffed with Gardein beefless tips which was delicious and also a little spicier than anticipated, but I really wanted to order something that I couldn't get in Portland. I ended up asking for some vegan sour cream to try to tone down the spice, which helped. While I was eating the chile relleno, I knew I was going to pay for it later and did end up buying some Tums to take to our show! It was worth it though. My sister had the tostada salad with Gardein beefless tips and seemed to really like it. The chips and guacamole were great too! I would definitely eat here again and it's worth the trek out to Mandalay Bay on the strip. Thanks for offering such a great vegan menu, Hussong's!",

I was done with being at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway and wanted a good meal, but of course I did not want to pay a huge price for my food, plus I did not want to wait for a long period of time getting that food, as I was hungry at that moment.  I was walking to find that kind of place when I see Hussong's and decided to eat here and I was grateful that I did.  The waitress that was serving me, came up and introduced herself and asked if I wanted something to drink, this was very fast, plus as many tables she was serving she was able to get my drink back to me very fast.  It did take sometime for her to return to get my order, but of course she seamed to have plenty of tables she was working on and one big table was getting their food when I was ready to order, of course the chip and salsa were waiting for me to eat and I did.  The quality of the food once it arrived was very good, the freshness was outstanding and the time it took to get to my table was fast.  I enjoy the meal and look forward to returning back, especially for the good food, and especially for the mariachi singing country songs, that was what made my evening.  The only thing bad is I had order an appetizer and it never arrived, even after asking the waitress about that dish.  I was OK with that, as I did not get charged for that dish and everything was well priced.",

We scarfed them down, they didn't taste half bad going down but coming out was another story. We were sick the rest of the night and following day from food poisoning.  I went to go talk to the manager, face still pale I could hardly look in the restaurant, The manager basically said that no one else got sick so too bad for us. The best he could conjure up was \"maybe\" offering us some more food if we called some other number. I didn't want to risk throwing up again so I settled for this yelp review...   next time we'll stay at the camp ground instead of enter a land of greed driven frat party hell, all well vomiting.",

    "text": "I went here the other night with my friend who loves Mexican food. We went on a Saturday night, and they had a mariachi band playing the entire time which is cool, but it's not fun when you're trying to talk. Right when we entered, the server immediately brought us warm chips and salsa. It was pretty good. Although, I'm in a bit of a spicy kick right now, so I wish they were spicier. My friend ordered a chicken quesadilla, ad I ordered a carne asada burrito. My burrito was decent. I prefer Chipotle a lot more, and Chipotle is half the price. My friend's quesadilla was pretty tasty. The food wasn't bad nor was it amazing. It certainly wasn't worth the $30 for the two items. I don't think I'd ever go back again.",

Let's just say that my quesadilla lunch + my free corn had me in the food coma necessary to snooze away the rest of the day poolside so I could party the night away. And my lunch tab was under $10.00! More money for the slots and cocktails! Oh yeah, the ingenious \"open face\" chicken quesadilla allowed me the freedom to pluck off all the tomatoes prior to folding it in half to eat. I'm a fan of lunch at Hussong's (eventhough I didn't have one of their world famous margaritas)!",

He wasn't too much in the know of the vegan ingredients. Would recommend he learn a bit about that. I would recommend you try this place (speaking only on behalf of the vegan menu) if you're looking for some good Mexican vegan.",

    "text": "I didn't even know this place existed because it's always overshadowed by my desire to go to Burger Bar whenever I get this close to The Strip.  We had to meet some family for dinner at Mandalay and told them about Burger Bar's greatness.  Upon arriving we found out the BB was closed for a private event so we had to pick another place.  Since we didn't feel like walking more than 10 feet we decided on Hussong's.   The name might be a little off-putting as it doesn't scream \"Mexican Food\" and they claim to be the inventor of the Margarita.  Still, we gave it a chance and we were pleasantly surprised.  It was a little pricey for Mexican food but cheap for Strip standards.  The waiter did an okay job but was a little slow after we ordered.  My wife had Enchiladas and the rest of us had their Chicken Tostada Salad, which was pretty delicious!  They had two fried strips of Flour Tortilla that came along with the salad rather than a fried bowl and I was a big fan!  I did have a couple of problems with the place, however.  As I said the waiter was 'ok' but he constantly tried to upsell us stuff.  I hate when they offer you Guacamole like it's on the house when it really isn't.  I'm of the opinion that if you offer it, it's free.  We didn't bite.  The biggest thing that I didn't like was the fact that their Margarita's came in Pint Glasses.  Really?  You claim to be the Margarita inventor and you're going to put them in a pint glass? I don't think so.  That alone lost a whole star for me.  There was a pretty sweet Mariachi Band wandering around and they were playing some rock hits that you would expect from Mariachis.  Pretty cool.",

The chips and salsa were pretty good as well. I ordered nachos for my meal and shared them with a friend. While we were waiting for our food, the trio made its way to our table. They were a crazy fun time. Remixed classic mariachi songs with modern day music like LMFAO. We were having a great time listening to them.   The food came out and was pretty decent. The nachos were piled high with gooey cheese, beans, corn, and chicken. I also tried some of the quesadilla, which was loaded with carnitas, sour cream, and beans.   I would come back here again, had a great time.",

You get complimentary chips and salsas which are great too.  However, I don't know if it's because of it being happy hour but the service was horrible. Our server took our order and we never saw him again until he brought us the bill. Never came to ask if we wanted to order another round of drinks or if we wanted more food or even to simply fill our water cups. It literally felt like it was just moving the masses in and moving them out as quickly as possible. Even if there are empty tables, expect to wait because they try to maximize seating, meaning there could be a table for four available but if you're a party of two you will have to wait for a table for two to open up.",

    "text": "Another restaurant with loads of fake \"memorabilia\" on the walls.  When I arrived, they walked me past a bunch of open tables to the table farthest in the back, right next to the constantly swinging kitchen door, and facing the table that was being used by the staff to fold napkins. If it were not for the fact that the busboy folding napkins had a great butt, I would have complained.  Later, when they found out that I am conducting one of the big shows in town, they offered to move me to a better table. I politely declined, (Too Late) but thought; \"Ya mean if you'd thought that I wasn't your average customer, you would have given me a reasonable table?\" Not good.  They advertise as \"Not your standard gringo Mexican food place\". But that's exactly what I found. The food was all very average. The tomatillo salsa that was served on my \"Enchiladas Suizas\" was the same that was served with the chips when I arrived. The chicken inside did not seem spiced or marinaded in any way. The tortillas were dull.  The margarita was good (made with fresh lime juice), but it was not \"the original\" margarita, as advertised. According to Hussong's history, the original was made with Damiana liqueur, which adds a slightly bitter, herbal flavor. Here, they substitute Cointreau, which is citrusy and very sweet - again, appealing to the average Gringo.  I've mentioned this before, but I'll bring it up again: Las Vegas is jam-packed with awesome Mexican restaurants - and most of them are dirt cheap. If you're gonna charge $16 for an enchilada, you'd better back it up with outstanding food; interesting drinks, and impeccable service.  I did not find any of those here.",

My husband ordered some kind of Angus tacos (3) with rice and beans. For $18 I expected tacos with some beef to them, they were about the size of the palm of my hand, very unsatisfactory.

I was so excited to try Hussong's once I saw they had an entire vegan menu and my meal did not disappoint!! 4 different types of vegan tacos, all on happy hour for $3 from 3-6pm.   Beware, the vegan chicken is like very realistic pork. I checked with several staff members who assured me it was vegan. The staff seemed knowledgeable and were very accommodating.   I got vegan beef, chicken, veggie and fish tacos and all were awesome. They use gardein products but the chefs are miracle workers.   Check in on yelp and you get a free street corn or tequila shot. I chose street corn and they even veganized it!!   Our waiter was awesome, friendly, and helpful. Overall a great experience for everyone at the table but especially me as a vegan.

The Hubs and I took the kiddos to Hussong's on Saturday night over Memorial Day weekend. It was actually the 2nd time we'd eaten there, so we already knew it was amazing. It was crowded, but we were smart and made reservations. We were seated promptly and chips/salsa made it to our table within minutes. They serve 2 kinds of salsa and the darker of the two (chipotle, I think) is INCREDIBLE!! Honestly, I'd drink it. I might have. Don't judge. It's Vegas, baby.  But I digress...  Our server was fast, friendly and efficient. He must have been crazy busy, but he never made us feel rushed. I had the barbacoa tacos (having already sampled the Carnitas tacos last time), The Hubs had the barbacoa chimichanga, Kid #1 had chicken enchiladas with rice and beans and Kid #2 (aka Basic Baby) had cheese enchiladas. We also ordered the street corn - off the cob, please - and some bean dip. Our food came out quickly and every single thing was really good. My tacos were stuffed with juicy barbocoa and had queso fresco, cilantro and pickled onions on top. Honestly, the pickled onions sealed the deal for me. They were a perfect counter to the rich meat. Hubs said his chimichanga was out of this world, stuffed with the same rich barbacoa that was on my tacos. Both kiddos scarfed down their food, so I'm guessing they loved it as well. We need to talk about the street corn, though. Sweet corn, slathered in mayo butter, cotija and chili flakes. My only complaint is that they don't serve it 5-gallon buckets.   The Mariachi Band.  Yeah, we loved them. The Hubs was wearing a Star Wars T-shirt and as soon as they spied it, they launched into a Mariachi version of \"The Imperial Death March\". They played Baby Shark for my youngest kiddo, who melted from happiness. I wanted to hate them for that, but they then threw down some New Kids on the Block, so all was forgiven.   Go to Hussongs. Eat the corn. Kick it with the band. You won't forget it.",

Started off ordering drinks.  They were quickly brought out by our server (can't remember his name, but he was great!), as well as a couple of baskets of chips with 2 different kinds of salsa.  The chips were warm, crispy, and delish!  I couldn't stop easing them!  The group I was with ordered various things, but I ordered the fish tacos.  The fish was hot and crispy with just the right amount of sauce and veggies.  They were so good!  My tacos also came with beans and rice.  I didn't eat much of them as I was stuffed from the 3 tacos, bunches of chips, and my Bulldog Margarita.  Oh ya, the Bulldog Margarita, I forgot to mention that it was as big as my head...lol!  The margarita was perfectly sour, and perfectly salted around the rim too.  Did I mention that you can get a margarita to go too?!  I took 2...YES PLEASE and THANK YOU! When looking for great Mexican food on the strip with a fun atmosphere, definitely check out Hussong's.  I'm already looking forward to our next Vegas trip to we can eat there again.",

Very unique bar area with cool decor. Very clean and well organized. Our waiter came by to check on us several times. Food at other tables looked yummy! Will definitely come back here for dinner and leave a review for food. Recommend for drinks if your just hanging out.",

Order chiliie reno it was not batter in egg nor cheese it was more like a stuff pepper i order a burrito $17 just for the burrito we order corn on stick beans were not friend they actually had chorizo mix in them three plates 85. Dollars and when we were paying the guy waiter luise said are you going to tip. I shock he even said that we were going to leave a cash tip at the table instead my other half was infuriated to why he even said that she went straight to management. Over all to expensive no none authentic mexican food and very rude wait waiter",

We sat at the bar, which is where we wanted to sit, for some drinks and snacks and the bartenders working were some of the nicest and most professional that I have seen in a long time.  All of the individuals working here were nice and professional.    We both ordered the original margaritas and they were wonderful.  The chips and salsas were good as well.  You get two types of salsas with the chips.  We also ordered some guacamole which was good as well.    For a meal I ordered the vegetable tacos and my husband ordered a mixture of shrimp, pork, and steak tacos which he said were fantastic.  They have tons of vegetarian and vegan items on the menu too!   On the night that we went there was a live mariachi band going around and taking song requests.  They were wonderful and made the experience such a great one!  I would completely recommend Hussong's Cantina to anyone looking for a quick drink, snack, or whole meal - great food, atmosphere, and waitstaff.",

    "text": "Hussong's is an average Tex-Mex restaurant.  This one in the shops at Mandalay Place was very noisy on a Sunday late afternoon.  The football game was on so loudly it was difficult to have a conversation.  Four of us met to have dinner.  Our drinks were delivered quickly and then our order was taken.  I was the only one who uses Yelp so I used the check in offer to get a free Mexican street corn.  The corn was OK.  The kernels are a bit small this time of the year but the grilling and the cotija cheese were flavorful.  I had a bit of a smug attitude in enjoying the corn while the three others just looked on.  Yelp or lose--their choice!  We brought chips and salsas and it looked like there were three kinds of salsa.  Not so.  Two of them were fire roasted salsa and they were identical.  None of them had any zip to them.  For my main course, I got their carne asada.  It was a bit unusual the wait the thin meat was laid out along the center of the plate with some salsa verde on the meat.  The meat was cooked rare as I asked when I gave the server my order.  There was also rice, beans, and cubed potatoes.  I thought it was a bit of an odd combo for a Mexican plate. No one ordered dessert.  Hussong's was OK but there are so many places that serve more authentic and better Mexican food in Las Vegas.  This isn't the most convenient place for a local to get to.  I would wager that most of the clientele were tourists.  Well, at least I tried it.",

When we 1st got there we got seated right away I checked in and my husband was given a huge shot of tequila .  Looked over the menu and I ordered the vegan veggie enchiladas. And my husband had the chicken wet burrito.  Before our dinner came out we got chips and 3 salsas. That were delicious. A little bit later meal came even though I was really tasty and had a little bit too much salt for my taste. But the veggies were cooked deliciously  and the beans were my favorite I wasn't a big fan of the rice. My husband said his burrito was delicious and it was also a huge portion. Unfortunately I did not have Room for the vegan chocolate cake .  Our favorite part of this restaurant is the group that comes around to the tables to sing they are hilarious they make you request songs they do not charge for the songs and you just tip them at the end if you like it made our dinner that much more interesting . Definitely will be coming back here again",

I got the free corn from yelp! Its was amazing the best I've ever had. I would've gladly paid for it! I got the breaskfast burrito. It was yummy and filling I really could only eat 1/2. It was filled with chrizio, beans (refried), cheese, and potatoes topped with 2 fried eggs. But you can get the eggs your way.   It was a bit pricey for Mexican food but it is in vegas between 2 hotels. Service was great!",

She said there was none and said there very clean and I would not have a problem. I ordered a simple salad and salsa as dressing which I asked every ? possible to make sure it was vegan oil free. I prefer to be safe and avoid chance of issues very easy right!?! Well nope she lied about 10-15 min after I ate there I got extremely sick!!! It was awful how sick I was and felt sick for the remainder of my trip! I had to call my dr and as soon as I landed back home go straight in. I wouldn't suggest going here if you are truly vegan or have any food allergies. After calling and talking to a person higher up come to find out the peppers are oiled and there is some oil in the salsa sauces.",

    "text": "Wife and I loved it! We started our Vegas wander killing time between shows that night and on our way through the Luxor and into Mandalay we stumble upon Hussongs Cantina right next to Burger Bar. We popped in for a quick drink at the bar. I have to say that we met one of the best bartenders we experienced in quite some time. Our drinks were simple but on point, a Stella and an Long Island. Our bartender invited us back later to show off a fun drink...we told him we would return.  After a quick round or two we were off to the next show. Immediately following the show we were right back at Hussongs to take our 'tender up on his drink idea. It was a concoction containing Captain Morgan's, Blue curacao, Malibu, Midori, Pineapple Juice and Sour Mix called...\"Liquid Marijuana\". We had never heard of it before but I know understand it's catching on. All I have to say is WOW, I want one right now that it crossed my mind. An instant hit! (no pun intended). Sip, sip, pass!!  We ordered a small plate of nachos to help float the alcohol down the right path and to curb any late night \"munchies\". The next morning or should I say morning to me, afternoon to you, we hit Hussongs again for some more grub. This time the 3 taco plate. 3 corn tortillas piled high with shredded chicken, chopped & cilantro and topped with a generous portion of guacamole...Yum to the 3rd power!  Lunchtime's drinks were not as great as the night before but I will blame the 'tenders for that I guess. The wife I believe went easy that day on the drink but I tip-toed towards something new..The Hussong's Red Eye. It's a mix of Tetcate Beer, homemade Bloody Mary mix served with a shot of Resposado Tequila on the side & garnished with Jerky & Celery. I know, wow and full meal in a glass right?? Well not really. The drink was so so and the waiter had to tell me (After I asked) that they were out of Jerky and Celery!? WTF! Oh Well...I was half hung over and wasn't gonna cry about it, but that part sucked..it sounded so good on paper.  Price was very reasonable I felt and wait staff was sometimes slow be super friendly. Night time bartenders rock and should retrain the day-trippers. Overall we obviously loved it if we made it back there multiple times in a 4 day stretch. Can't wait to hit them up again on our next trip to Sin City.",

The yelp reviews were on the OK side, and since we were craving Mexican food we decided to go there because it was within walking distance to our hotel.  The GOOD- The only good thing about this place is the location- right in the middle of the Shops at Mandalay Bay.  The OK- I ordered the chicken enchilada suizas.  They were ok.  Nothing special, and I've definitely had better.  My boyfriend ordered the Cuatro tacos with carnitas and carne asada. He didn't like them at all! They were dry and the meat did not taste good.  Neither of us finished our meals, I think I ate one enchilada and he ate 2 of his 4 tacos. The chips and salsa they give you is not that good either.  We were starving so we ate some of the chips they gave us, but overall the food was not that good.  The service was ok, but I did have to ask a few times to get a straw.  The BAD- The mariachi music was so LOUD!  My boyfriend and I were sitting right across the table from each other and had to yell to even hear what the other person was saying.  Also, $60 for a pitcher of margaritas, and $18 for one margarita!!!  That is INSANE to charge that much!  I get it's Las Vegas and everything there is expensive, but c'mon, that is absolutely ridiculous!    Overall, when we are in Vegas again next year, we will be seeking Mexican food elsewhere at other establishments...",

Atmosphere- \"Festive\" Mexian (as opposed to upscale Mexican) Food- 5 stars Drinks-  5 stars for taste.....2 stars for price Service-   based on our experience (twice)....2.5 star  The bar service was pretty average to slightly below average (just my experience based on TWO visits).  Also,  the prices are pretty steep,  even for Vegas.   $12 or more for a margarita in a smallish glass with a ton of ice?   Wow.......they are good margaritas.....maybe one of the best I've had; but c'mon......$12+ ?  Happy hour is \"1/2 price\"......which was still $6.00 for a smallish (in my opinion) 'rita.   As for service,  I guess it was adequate,  but our bartender just wasn't friendly and/or engaging.  Hospitality,  particularly Vegas,  isn't about adequate,  in my view.  It's about EXCELLENCE.    He took our order,  but that was about it.  We even tried to make a little small talk....not much,  just little to be friendly.  Also,  there were only 4-6 people at the bar so he wasn't in the weeds.   No big deal....but I may or may not be looking to  return.  I just have a thing tor service.  It's so important.  Make people want yo return (and write good reviews) ;)  Overall, I'd give it 3.5 stars.  Easy potential for 4 star....just make your customers feel like you are happy they are there....spending $$.    Pretty easy.",

I ordered the carne asada plate and the rest of our table ordered. That is about where the great service stopped. A couple other people came after and it seemed that her service went to the other 2 tables as they got their food before us even after being seated well after us and they had their bill paid and left well before we could even get her attention for the bill. After getting the bill we had to sit around even more waiting for her to get it and return our card. This is the loss of the 2 stars as poor service can ruin an experience  The food was pretty good though. My carne asada was very moist and very flavorful. I was able to make a burrito with it as they serviced it with chorizo beans, rice, and guacamole and sour cream and a tortilla. They also served some potatoes with it but they were meh at the best. Still had extra carne asada which was very nice as I was able to eat it alone and it was good. The chips and salsa was good and they had this tomatillo salsa that was great  Overall, I'd probably return but not if I was in a hurry or had to meet people somewhere",

    "text": "Ok...I have been here 2 nights in a row.   First Night:  I thought it was great! The service was awesome and the food was great. We got the carna asada plate, guac, and shrimp ceviche. Ok...the ceviche wasn't all that great. It was very small and hardly any shrimp. I like mine to be a little more zesty but this was on the more tiny bit tart. I like the tast of lemon n lime in my ceviche so I guess it really depends on your taste. The chip and salsa that they give you is yummy. I really like their chips!! thick and not too salty.   Second Night: Ok...we ordered the Chicken Tostada salad and Baja Hamburger. The Salad was very plain and didn't even come in a tostada bowl (am I the only one that expects it in a bowl?). ANyways, I expected it to come in a bowl and instead, there were just 2 giant tostada chips in the salad. The sauce was whatevers and hardly any corn or the other veggies mentioned from the menu. We first thought the corn was missing but when we dug dip enough, we found few...I mean FEW corn peices on the bottom. Very sad.  On to the Baja hamburger. It had bacon, ham, and avocado. It wasn't as beautiful as in the picture and it was overly salty. I guess the avocado is there to help with the saltiness but the ham was way too salty. Also, one of the workers kept dropping things. I saw him spill dressing all over a table as he was delivering food. And he also dropped plates too. Poor guy. However, our waiter never showed up to us to ask if we needed anything the whole night. I mean, the place is pretty small and he passed us by every time he had to serve another table. Didn't like that waiter.  Also, I was irritated by some loser trying to pick up on a girl at the bar.  He kept trying to make the conversation flow and asking for high fives. High fives really? ugh...it was really pathetic. She turned her body and was talking to the bartender and tried really hard to put her head in another direction or just looking down her cup.   The music was whatevers too. I don't like loud music in my ears. I gave it a 3 since the first night was good but not so much the second night. Not bad to go at least once and check it out yourself.",

They have a decent-size menu, and friendly staff and management.   Went there with the honey, and ordered a pitcher of original margaritas. They said they don't use pre-made margarita mix, which I find too sweet. The margaritas were sweet-made with agave nectar, but not over the top.  Chips and salsa were good, and the salsas they serve have a good flavor and decent heat. I asked if they have a HOTHOT salsa, and the waiter brought out a salsa made with habanero and goodness know what else. After one taste, I couldn't feel my mouth for a good five minutes. If I was drooling, I wouldn't have felt it.  We had a queso fundido appetizer with chimichurri. We added the chorizo to the dish, and it came with warm corn tortillas. Let me tell you, it was fantastic. The dish is small, but packed with flavor. Melted cheesy, meaty goodness, and we couldn't get enough.  The boyfriend got the enchiladas plazeras at the waiter's recommendation. The plate looked like a mess, with potatoes, carrots and sauce on top that made it look like some sort of stew dish. The stew concoction on top was pretty good, but the enchiladas underneath all of that didn't have very much flavor.  I got the fish tacos, and for fish tacos, they were quite tasty. Generous fish, lots of cabbage slaw and sauce.   The portions on the entrees were generous, and we left stuffed and satisfied.  We'll be going back to try another dish in the future, and to see the rock and roll mariachi band...which from what I hear, plays everything from rap to Black Sabbath. Coming from a mariachi-player family, I've GOT to see that....",

Our first choice, The Burger Bar, had a wait so we decided  to go next door to Hussongs.  I found it to be extremely overpriced.  I understand it's on the Strip but I can see paying almost $20 for a rice and beans dish.  We decided to get appetizers.  My daughter ordered the chicken quesadillas and said they were good but greasy.  I ordered the taquitos and got three very small tacos.  The tortillas were small than El Pastor sized tortillas.  The tacquitos were good but nothing to be excited about.  My friend ordered the Queso Fundido with chorizo.  I get that chorizo is a very greasy sausage but she literally spooned a couple of tablespoons of grease out of the bowl before being able to eat it.  Draining the chorizo wouldn't have affected the taste of the dish at all.  Service was quick and friendly but all in all it was pretty unimpressive.  I'll stay off the Strip and stick to El Sombrero or something similar",

It was amazing start to finish - Danielle was a lovely server, checking in with us at the right times to help us out. My Bloody Mary was a little spicy and strong, just how I like it. The portions were huge (I got three carne asada tacos, rice, and beans), and it was real bummer that our hotel didn't have fridge space to take leftovers. I asked for avocado slices instead of guacamole, and they did it without issue. Food was quick and delicious. Will most likely eat there again before we leave Vegas!",

If you like it sweet you may want to chat with the bar tender. I am sure they will accommodate with all of the margaritas that they have!  Which leads me to my next point - the service. Our waiter was very on top of the work for a busy Saturday night. Additionally, management came over to the table multiple times to make sure everything was taken care of.   My friend and I ordered and split the al pastor chicken and the barbacoa (spelling ???) tacos (3 tacos per order) and a side of guac (because who can go to a Mexican restaurant and not order some guac!!).  I personally liked the barbacoa tacos the best ! The rice and beans that come with it were so so and the guac had tomatoes and to much lemon lime taste which wasn't my thing and is the reason for the 4 stars.   Atmosphere was busy for a Saturday night but not to crowded. This may not be the place to go if you have children or people who are sensitive to loud sounds because of the loud music the band plays. The music did not bother me - I thought the band added to the ambiance but I could see how it may bother some people so that is just a heads up.   Pro tips: Ask about a locals discount and make sure to check in to get the free shot or grilled corn.",

We didn't have a reservation but were seated right away around 12:30pm on a Monday.  The restaurant wasn't busy but by the time we left it was full. You do get tortilla chips and salsa. I liked the chips....they were on the thin side and had a bit of a potato chip taste which I really liked (probably because they were salty). Anyway, the menu is extensive and on the pricey side (but you are at the Mandalay Bay) There were 4 of us in our party. We all ordered an entree; a two meat combo fajita, a quesdilla and  two chicken tacos entrees. All entrees came with rice and beans. Everyone liked their food. We all had about 4 margaritas each (lol!) The frozen Cadillac Margaritas were made right and excellent!! We spent about 3 hours eating and drinking and we were left alone to have our fun. Our excellent server checked on us always at the right time.  Food was good and margaritas were EXCELLENT.  Will definitely return.",

Food came out of the kitchen super quick might have set the record or at least got in the top 5 of all my places waiting on food lol. I couldn't find nothing I didn't like about this place I mean it's located in a nice spot, the food was good, service was good, it's more like a Tex-Mex mix of a sports bar all in one and didn't really seem to try to be any more then that. Best part tab was under $30 for all this during happy hour being located in the Shoppes. 4 out of 5 all day no issues at hand I would return for the same deal if I'm visiting.",

    "text": "We walked by this place several time during our week in Vegas. The last day of our trip we were hauling luggage and stopped in for lunch. We ended up feeling like we were ready to tackle a night of entertainment by the time we left!   We opted to share between the two of us one of their giant original margaritas (serves 2.5 glasses for under $30 and you get to keep the oversized vessel). We are margaritas people, and this one did NOT disappoint. I was so pleased to read that they use a reposado tequila for the drink!    Chips with two kinds of excellent salsa showed up! Neither one hot spicy but very very good, especially when combined!  We ordered the traditional Guac to start and were surprised when it came with pork rinds instead of chip! It ended up being a pleasant surprise though- the rinds have a lime and spice (not hot spicy) seasoning to them!   I ordered the chicken burrito with cheese dip smothering. It was really good but the cheese dip was definitely different! I asked our sever who told us that the special ingredient was chicken broth mixed in. It wasn't bad! It was just different than what we were used to so I totally recommend giving it whirl!   My sweetheart had the shrimp tacos. Our server asked if grilled or fried was preferred. She recommend the fried which ended up getting a rating of \"pretty good\" which was a change of pace from the typical lack luster responses from my gentleman.   I don't know if it was an owner or manager but the next thing we knew we had a shirt and a tank top very nonchalantly left on our table (I think they were changing out their inventory. The table behind us ( large group) were also gifted some shirts. A little bit later the same gentleman stopped by and set two (adorable mini red solo cup) shots on our table and said \"I didn't want you to feel left out\" while he took a tray full of tequila to the large group.   Our server offered to clean and bag our huge glass and when she returned with what was still in the glass in a to-go cup she had topped it off fresh.   The gentleman stopped by and gave us free margarita cards to use later as well as let us know that there's a band that pops in on the evenings as well.  After running a couple businesses myself, I know that some owners would see some of this as a negative but I vouch that those kinds of owners have no idea how to run a business. THIS is how you create locality. This is how you make regulars out of out of Towners. This is business done to the highest level. You not only meet the expectations of providing good food and attentive service, you blow it out of the f-ing water.   We're here for conventions, will be back, and will recommend Hussong's to anyone asking \"where should we eat in Las Vegas?\"  Kudos.",

And the chocolate cake is to die for, so moist and delicious--enough for two people! Overall, the food is good quality and the presentations are enticing.  If dining in, you'll be greeted by pleasant hostesses and helpful servers. The staff are also very knowledgeable about vegan ingredients and they are careful regarding cross contamination! I've never gotten sick or experienced any negative side effects despite the restaurant not being fully vegan. The environment is chill with popular music of all genres playing in the background. They also have a bar, if that's your thing!  If you're vegan (or even if you're not), hungry and love Mexican food, this place is a MUST GO! Yummy is an understatement!",

Friendly staff. Card and cash accepted.  A bit pricey, but it's on the strip, so that's expected. Would recommend!",

The beans were rather bland and the rice didn't have much flavor either. You're given two salsas, one is a watery Pico de Gallo that is quite fresh but lacks flavor and has a watery consistency. The second salsa as pictured is more of a spicy chili roasted or Chipotle salsa and is excellent. Overall the place is very loud, and crowded. The service was OK but nothing to really mention. If you're in the mood for some decent Mexican food that is quite pricey in a loud cantina this is your place.",

We had the Baja shrimp and fish tacos, and a pitcher of margaritas. Everything was good. Including the service. I was debating between a 3 and a 4 with this review. Not because anything was bad but I don't feel like I tried enough things to give an accurate recommendation. Also I usually reserve 4s for great. But I decided not to ding because I'm not from here and won't be coming back any time soon, and I had zero complaints. Overall it is a solid place, even for this picky Texan.",

The enchiladas were decent (not something I'd go back and order though) and we didn't like the tostadas at all - they lacked flavor.   They also served complimentary hot chips and salsa, which were great. Also we got a free corn appetizer, a yelp check-in offer. The corn was also very good.   We were staying at Hilton Elara and went all the way to Mandalay bay just to eat at this restaurant. It wasn't really worth it though.",

We were promptly seated but it took quite awhile for someone to come around for our drink orders and service throughout the meal continued to be lacking. I was not impressed by the food. I ordered the taco meal which comes with 2 tacos, rice and beans. The tacos were super sub par street style tacos. The tortillas were greasy as all heck and the meat was just lacking flavor. Even the rice and beans were mediocre.  My lunch buddies all ordered different items including the posole, flautas, and rib eye (?) tacos I believe, and none of them were impressed either. Their saving grace was their salsa and chips. Their chipotle salsa is amazing. I'm glad I had that at least to fill up on. Overall was disappointed and will not be coming back.",

Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and helpful with the questions we had about particular items. He was also very efficient juggling between the larger parties and the smaller tables so no one was over-looked.   We both had the taco's (5 mini soft taco's per plate) which were very satisfying. I had the ribeye taco's and, although hey had a great flavor,  the meat was pretty tough- guess I should have stuck with the chicken.  I loved their mango habanero guacamole which I could have made a meal of in and of itself with their chips that were just right -- lots of crunch and light on the salt! I also enjoyed a jalapeno cucumber cocktail that was very refreshing although I had a friend tease me about not getting their famous Margarita which they claim to be the original creators~ just another good reason to go back besides all the delicious looking plates that past by us as we were eating.   This one is certainly staying on our radar!",

I liked the tortilla chips, they where different, much thicker, much like you may get at a Mexican restaurant when they serve you queso and it comes with thicker chips. The waitress was great, and very attentive. Probably the second best service I had the entire time I was in LV.  The food had a good bit of flavor cooked in, not the standard poured on after microwaving flavor you find at a lot of places. The portions were a bit on the smaller side for the price, but the quality was there. I cannot comment on the bar or drinks, but everyone seemed to be enjoying the huge margaritas.   I would not hesitate to stop by again on my next trip.",

We mainly booked in advance so that we could eat somewhere on NYE that had a good vegan selection for myself, with plenty of options for the others in my group.  The atmosphere was great, we had great service and the music was good. They had hired a Mariachi band that came around the tables and played tunes on request for tips. We got them to play Folsom Prison Blues by Johnny Cash! They created a great atmosphere and the tune was flawless! Really fun.  The food was great, I had the vegan burrito and everyone else ordered vegetarian/meat dishes. Everyone said their food was tasty and a good portion.  Overall, no complaints! My burrito could have been more 'saucier' but it wasn't essential.  If you're a vegan, or just after some good Mexican food while staying at the Mandalay Bay, head on over to Hussong's!",

    "text": "I'm knocking this place down to 3 stars. The food wasn't nearly as good this time around as my previous two visits. The base of the sope seemed thicker and chewier than before and the chicken and carnitas toppings were overcooked and dry. The lobster tacos were stuffed with lettuce, cotija cheese, sour cream and other stuff that I could barely taste any lobster. Less ingredients would have made this a much better dish. The chicken flautas were so bone dry and overcooked that they were pretty much inedible.  Overall, it was a real disappointment considering we enjoyed their food previously. The service was also a little spotty, but it seemed like there weren't enough waitresses for all of the tables. The food is overpriced, so if you go make sure you get a gift certificate from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a>.",

    "text": "So the other reviews here are not reflective of my experience whatsoever. I'm not sure if we just got dealt a really good hand or what, but I super enjoyed myself. The server was great at making recommendations for both food and drink, if the teeniest bit pushy (she could tell we liked her and after we had been served our food she pleaded, \"Are you SUUUUURE you don't want any margaritas?\" Yes we're sure. I have to drive in a minute and my friend has to go back to work). The hostess, however, was probably 17 and having the worst day of her life. No smiles, no acknowledgement when we asked for a table, just grabbing menus and leading us to a table. (I know, Girl, being 17 is hard. It's even harder when you hate your life. Smile a bit! It gets better, I promise. Molly out.)  Anyway, I had a special--some kind of elevated Taco Bell Crunchwrap Supreme. But I don't want to insult it by calling it Taco Bell food, because it was really great. It was the first quesadilla-type food I ever had to eat with a fork. It was stuffed to the brim with whole slices of tomato, avocado, and raw jalepeno. All of it tasted super fresh. The chips and salsa left a little to be desired, but the green salsa was flavorful and fresh.   Despite the sad hostess and salsa situations, I would like to try it again. Judging by the other reviews, I don't know if I'll get so lucky again, but I enjoyed it and would be willing to give it a try.",

    "text": "Dropped in at Hussong's for a dinner on a Saturday night with my husband, his aunt and her boyfriend. The aunt and her boyfriend had actually already been to Hussong's and wanted us to try the place out. They're out-of-towners - taking us locals to a place! Ha!  The place is in Mandalay Shoppes next to one of my faves - Burger Bar. The place itself is small and narrow (also kind of like Burger Bar). And the tables are kind of close together, plus the place is a little cramped. More than a few times I felt like I needed to duck or scooch out of the way of servers trying to get food to other tables.  We started with chips (two salsas - red, which is a very tomato-based salsa, and a green tomatillo salsa which had a bit of a kick, but not much). Thank goodness we opted to get a side of guac to dip the chips in. It saved the day! It had nice, big chunks of avocado in it, which made happy.   I had the Enchilada Suizas. Chicken enchiladas with tomatillo sauce, sour cream, and (I think) basil leaves topped on them. Also comes with a side of beans and rice. Strangely enough, I was a fan of the beans. Usually I am not at Mexican places, but these beans I actually liked. They had more texture and chunks of beans than others I have had. The rice was pretty bland - nothing special. The enchiladas were quite refreshing because they were much different than others I have had. With the addition of the topping of basil leaves, it made this dish much more complex and the chicken was not shredded, it was more like large, moist pieces of chicken in the enchiladas.  My husband had the carnitas platter, which comes with tortillas, peppers, onions, pickled onions, and a few other things. I tried some of the carnita and it was delish. They put a nice char on the meat and it actually comes out in CHUNKS, not shredded like so many other Mexican places.   We ended the meal with sopapillas. They come with a small dollop of caramel ice cream and chipotle honey dipping sauce. You only get TWO sopapillas in the order. They were okay, but Lindo Michocan has better sopapillas.  Overall I enjoyed the experience. The only complaints are the small space, crowded seating, and the kind of bland chips and salsa. The prices were not bad for STRIP prices.",

We got the tostada salad, which had a really weird vinaigrette that was bitter and sour. We also tried the vegetarian veggie-chicken quesadilla which was decent, but it had a weird smell and I'm praying it was veggie-chicken and not actual chicken. We had to wait over 20min for our food to be served, and the restaurant wasn't even crowded. We asked to make a virgin mojito which was just filled with ice and grossly over priced. We will not be returning.",

The abidance is rather chill (great for a big group since it looks like a bar-type of restaurant).    My friend ordered the vegan fajitas with the fake chicken and I ordered the vegan tacos with cabbage and avocado.  I am not a huge fan of fake meats but my friend LOVES it and was really happy with his order. I tried the veggies from his fajitas and the flavoring was VERY GOOD.  Mine, however, was a bit too lemony.  I ended up finishing it but compared to the flavor of my fiance's dish, I was a bit disappointed.  Next time we go here, I will order the fajitas with just veggies.    Overall, though, the service was very good and we were happy to have found a hidden restaurant with some cool vegan options.  :)",

I am still disappointed your hot sauce choices are limited to Tapatio and Tabsaco...would love a Cholula but that is splitting hairs.   Only complaint is that with all those hard surfaces it gets crazy loud. I like loud but when I'm partying, not eating. I recommend getting a reservation via Open Table if visiting on a weekend evening or when theres a concert nearby.",

The salsa is also bomb and so fresh.  Menu - Such a great selection. Really something for everyone. I didn't even know they had a vegan menu, but I actually was debating between options even without it.  I ordered the arugula salad which was a smaller portion, but delicious. Also, actually affordable - $12 for hotel Vegas. That's a steal.  So Vegas trip for work, but fun food indeed!  One note - arugula salad was not arugula but rather spinach....awk aardvark arugula. Still amazeballs nonetheless.",

    "text": "After an entire fun filled weekend full of vodka and cheap beer (though maybe not cheap in price), I was looking to grub on something hearty.  I searched 'vegan' on Yelp and saw that Husson's has an entire vegan menu! Hallelujah! So I drove my car...err...inched my car down the strip and made my way into the Mandalay Bay Shoppes where the restaurant is located.  Right as you sit down, you can order a giant margarita, or something a bit less sugary like a tall glass of cerveja.  A giant basket of chips is presented to you with not 1or 2, but 3 different types of salsa! (My favorite one is the sweeter tasting one with chunks of what looks like mango inside!  It took a long time for me to order because I simply could not decide what I wanted. Quesadillas, Tostadas, Enchiladas, Tacos, Chimichangas...alll Veganized! I asked for a recommendation and finally settled on the Chile Relleno. Because I've never had a vegan Chile Relleno before!  For one person, these are huge portions! There was a crispy tortilla topped with the grilled poblano chile stuffed Gardein Chik'n strips (there's beef available too!), onions, tomatoes, and potatos. Finally, it is covered in melted Daiya cheese and guacamole. Yum.. If that's not enough, there's a huge scoop of rice and beans on the side too!  I barely made a dent in my food before I had to pack it up to-go. The dish was pretty good. It's not 'authentic' in any way, but for the moment, it hit all the right spots.  Friendly service rounded out the meal, and happiness knowing that if I end up staying on this side of the strip away from the comforts of Steve Wynn's vegan-option paradise, I can count of this place to provide me a hearty vegan meal!",

After waiting almost an hour I ordered VEGAN chimi changa  waitress Taylor tells me it's  fried in fish, chicken,meat etc oil I said that is not VEGAN that's False ADVERTISING. I'm very upset and HUNGRY!!! Hussong's have a menu that says VEGAN on the back but to find out it has all the vegan products but  fried in chicken, fish, meat oil. That's a hospital trip waiting to happen for me due to I'm 100% ALLERGIC TO FISH AND ALL ANIMALS PRODUCTS.  I order a VEGAN corn on the cob after making sure it's 100% VEGAN. Daughters order VEGAN GARDENIA Brand which  is on the menu chiken tacos come back they are not GARDENIA brand waitress goes to kitchen to see what brand, it's some brand she couldn't pronounce Taylor looks on Menu to see if it stated GARDENIA Brand so she took both daughters food away she apologize say they going to take it up with corporate. So NO VEGAN CHIMICHANGA or GARDENIA brand products SMH LOL both are False advertising server brought out chips in salsas just a little leftover chips when asked  for more Taylor said they were out of chips  so they brought another type of chip they had to go get from the store which we didn't eat. Only had few chips from start one daughter had tater tots my VEGAN corn and water. What a worse Mother's Day dinner ever False ADVERTISING be aware of this place they are not 100% VEGAN only certain things like the corn on the cob LOL. I GAVE 1 STAR ONLY BECAUSE OUR WAITRESS INFORMED ME OF CHIMICHANGAS ARE COOKED IN ANIMAL FISH etc. OIL. VEGAN =NO PRODUCTS THAT HAS A MOTHER, VEGETARIAN = A PRODUCT THAT HAS A MOTHER. CORPORATE NEEDS TO BE EDUCATED ON VEGAN or remove the whole VEGAN MENU.",

    "text": "I LOVE this restaurant! This is my 3rd visit, and I will keep going back every time I'm in Vegas. Their Happy Hour deals are incredible, their service is fast, their portions are HUGE, and their food is absolutely delicious! I'm a vegetarian, and they even have Happy Hour specials for me, vegan options actually. I highly recommend their \"beef\" quesadilla for any vegetarian/vegan who visits. They have a \"chicken\" choice too, but I like the \"beef\" best. Their Original Margaritas are top notch too, as well as their roasted tomato salsa you get, for free, with homemade chips while you wait for yor meal.  I usually just sit at the bar, since it's only me, and I have always had stellar service from the bartenders. Phil and Jonathan are both super nice and attentive!  There's some history to this place too, although the original location is in Mexico. They say they were the 1st place to invent the Margarita. Not sure that's True, but it's a great story. You can read all about it on their menu as you wait, a surprisingly short time, for your food. You can also spend this time looking at all the crazy, ecclectic decorations on the walls, shelves, and ceiling.  Be sure to make Hussong's a stop next time you're in Vegas. You'll thank me!",

    "text": "I wanted to like this place. Really I did. We were here for a week and hoped this place was good enough to eat here twice. I had a Vegas Insider card with a special deal, 2 for 1 margaritas and a free appetizer with 2 entrees. Also had a gift certificate from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> but did not got a chance to use it during this visit.  At first I thought they made a mistake, but they indeed honored the card. We got the 2 for 1 margaritas and they knocked the price of an appetizer off of the bill. They were pushing a steak dinner special, maybe we should have spent a few more bucks for that. We decided on tacos instead. I had the steak tacos, my wife had the chicken tacos. Hers were greasy. Mine were dry. They weren't very good that day. Each taco dish also came with a small cup of beans and rice that were just ok.  They do give you free chips and 2 cups of salsa to start off but the mild salsa that was so mild we could barely taste it (looked kinda like balsamic vinegar) and the hot salsa was HOT but had the consistency of watered down ketchup. It was not salsa, it was hot sauce. We got a side of guacamole as our free appetizer. The guacamole was good and fresh, with chunks of avocado. So good we put it on our tacos.  The margaritas were good and strong. They were served in a 12 oz beer glass filled with ice. The Mariachi Band wasn't playing when we were here, but I hear they are just too loud, so we were just fine with the music playing through the sound system. Service was good. The hostess seated us right away and everything came out pretty quick. Our server was friendly and attentive.   If you are looking for a place in Mandalay Place to enjoy a drink or two, they make a really good margarita. We just weren't impressed with the food. Will probably go back but will definitely try something else if we do.",

It was luxuriously creamy and very satisfying.   The mojitos here are the best in the hotel. We tried the mojitos at the Franklin bar in Delano and one at the Border Grill in Mandalay Bay. The one at Hussong's is far superior. Pleasantly just sweet enough and a generous size. We tried the peach and mango mojitos and peach was the best of the two. Highly recommend.

The green tomatillo salsa was so nice and smokey and the red salsa had the perfect bite and tang. Delicious guacamole.   One of the highlights of our visit to Hussong's was the rockin' Mariachi band! The troupe started out with Mariachi classics but then performed the likes of Pink Floyd, Johnny Cash and and Neil Young. I'd come back just to see these guys!",

Pros -   Quite simply the best Mexican tasting food in Las Vegas! Fries were amazing Location is great if you're by Mandalay/Luxur Staff is very helpful and friendly Tortilla soup was to die for Fajitas were fantastic too and great meat cuts Real Mexican Food - authentic Roots in Ensenada Mexico - they own a bar there, same family - fun place!  Con -  Prices could be lower but maybe they pay for the location - Mandalay may have them by the balls.   In sum - You gota have it!!!! You need it!",

Hell we all have been eating and cooking it our entire lives. I've been going to the Cantina in Ensenada for 30 years but only to drink.   Once there ordered drinks that were normal Strip priced and started to check out the menu. 2 of us ordered Huevos Rancheros and other 2 Chiliquiles. The price of $10 was a bargain for casino food. I wasn't expecting what I was about to receive. Both plates were outfreakingstanding! Great meal, spicy, and the drinks that my friends ordered did the job. I highly recommend this joint to anyone that stays at Mandalay or the adjoins casinos. Kudos...",

Didn't take long at all to get a table, the place was packed and seating is pretty tight, not my favorite thing but the cool decor definitely made up for it! Off top I would give four stars just off their entire page dedicated to VEGAN! I'm still always amazed when I go out to \"regular\" restaurants and not struggle to find something yummy to eat! The waiter was super friendly and funny, he gave us great services despite how busy they were. We even got our free appetizer thru Yelp, that was amazingly delicious! Unfortunately when it came to our order, they got it wrong, both my son's and mine. They actually bought me an entirely different meal, I had to send it back and wait for the right food, while everyone else ate. The waiter was very nice about it. Once I got my food, it was worth it, some of the best Mexican vegan food I ever had!",

We had the vegan chicken quesadilla appetizer and the vegan grilled corn and both were delicious and part of the happy hour special. But this review is also for our two bartenders. Jack and John were friendly, helpful, and gave very efficient service even when the bar and restaurant got much busier. Great people and great food, definitely a must if you are in Vegas!",

It was actually a little too fast. I got my order before I even got close to finishing the chips and salsa. That's really my only complaint.   The menu isn't huge and there are no combination plates, but that wasn't a problem. I highly recommend the 3 Steak Tacos plate I got. It comes with rice and beans.   The waitress/bartender was really nice. I didn't order any alcohol but someone near me was drinking a margarita and it looked big.   If you're looking for vegan food, they have a vegan menu.

I had to dock them a star because they took a long time with our order, even though the place was hardly packed. When the food finally came, they gave us chicken instead of steak.

    "text": "Hussong's Cantina was a good place to grab a quick, cheap lunch while working at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center.  It was especially cheap for me because the Foursquare deal was written incorrectly, so I had two appetizers for half off, and my total bill came to under $10.    I loved their chips and salsa, which were fresh and tasty.  I thought the queso fundido was OK but not all that flavorful.  However, I really liked the crisp taquitos, which were well-filled and good.  Service was great and I'd return to try a margarita.",

    "text": "I have found my new spot! I really wanted to give this place 5 stars I really did! Our server was terrible :(  OK, so let me start... We ordered a Margarita that was made for 2 people to share. Yes I got drunk off it and yes I had a designated driver. It cost $25 for it but let me tell you it was strong and 48 ounces of heaven. It lasted my whole meal and that was with my man drinking off it too. The downside was as we watched the server at the bar making it she put a toothpick in her mouth that she then put cherries on and then put in our drink. GROSS! I'm totally getting that drink again it was too good. It was called \"The Romance\".  We started with tacos. If you show your local ID after 6 pm Mon-Fri you get up to 4 tacos at 50 cents each. YES just 50 cents each! They were by far the best part of the meal. You can pick between chicken, beef or carnitas.  I had the \"Enchiladas Suizas\" which was very good. It had Chicken, Tamatillo Sauce, Sour Cream, and Salsa. It also came with rice and beans that were full of flavor. I asked the server if it could be made with flour tortillas instead of corn but she tried arguing with me (her name was Yolanda) that Enchiladas cant be made with flour tortillas because it wont hold together. I finally said that I get them that way everywhere else and that is how I would like them. You will see by the picture I posted that they held up just fine :)  This dish cost $15.  My man had the \"Beef Fajitas\" and he ate every bit of it. He didn't like that it had corn grilled in with the veggies but he will know for next time to tell them to leave that off. This dish cost $19.  My mans Dad had the \"Chili Relleno\"  and this cost $16. He really enjoyed it.  I totally recommend this place to anyone who loves margaritas and great Mexican food!!!!!",

Barbara said she would call us back, and then did not. We came with the extra people, and they were thankfully able to accommodate after some slight grumbling from the male host that there was already reservations.  I started with the queso bean dip. It was the perfect blend of cheese and queso. I ordered the carne asada tacos, except the protein was not carne asada.  I asked the waiter and he said that it was indeed carne asada with a rub, but it was not. It was a pale protein, so I assume pork(did not taste like chicken). It was fair. The refried beans were very good.  Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food (shrimp fajitas, quesadilla and tostada salad.",

We usually go to Boca Park location but you will experience the same great service and high quality food here at this location...but with strip pricing ;)   My fav item hands down is their fysh tacos. I usually only get two during the happy hour menu because that's all I can eat. The entree with three tacos comes with beans and rice so it's enough for two people to share.   Hubs go to meal are the fajitas. He gets a chkn/beaf combo and it includes all the fixins'. He asks for flour torts because he does not like corn.  In the past we have came to this location for happy hour with friends and have ordered the vegan quesadillas option of the grilled veggies (can choose bf/chkn). Wowowowow they are amazing because they include potatoes... which is my fav thing in the whole world.  We don't order alcoholic drinks and just drink water so I can't comment on that part :)  Great service, awesome food.....we will keep coming back!",

Their tequila is some of the best that I have discovered too. Being educated in Tequila currently I can pass determination on how well it tasted too. Fabulous. The margaritas they serve here are so smooth too. Everything is made in house with such great food and cocktails what am I waiting for!  The wait staff was very friendly and helpful. When I did the Yelp check in Hussong's rewards the customer for doing this with an amazing prize. The check in gift is a shot of Tequila or street corn. I am sure you already know what I chose. You bet the Tequila! Cheers to Hussong's Cantina.   The bar area is where I sat and enjoyed my wonderful Tequila shot, but one is not enough. Now in my second shot of Tequila to ensure it is definitely the best! The bartender is very attentive and my food smells amazing. It tasted amazing too.  Decided that tacos go very well with tequila and margaritas so that is what I had. The tacos do not disappoint here either. Having sampled the tacos at the Boco Park location in Vegas they are just as I remembered. Great! The wait staff brought the tacos to the bar stool where I was sitting it seemed in an instant from when I ordered them. The carnitas tacos are larger than regular street tacos here and come with a variety of items on top too. They are so colorful topped off with peppers and they even have guacamole on them. So very filling and delicious. It is Friday and why not celebrate with Tequila and tacos like it's taco Tuesday!",

I've been to the Hussong's location at Boca Park before so I figured why not try this location.   The restaurant is located in the shops part of Mandalay Bay close to Burger Bar and Slice of Vegas. We fortunately were able to snag two seats at the bar since the place was super packed with the rodeo being in town. We came with about one hour left of HH specials.  For drinks we enjoyed some simple well cocktails for under $4 each. We also had some chips & salsa, chicken tacos, and potato skins. The food was decent, the drinks were cheap, and the service was quick & friendly.   A++ for cheap drinks & eats on the Strip. Keep in mind they don't offer gourmet or top of the line Mexican food, but they do have great margaritas and decent food.",

    "text": "Following the Aces' home opener at the Mandalay Bay Events Center, Diane and I enjoyed dinner for two at this classic staple of beer and Mexican cuisine.  You can have the beer; I'll concentrate on the cuisine.  Complimentary Tortilla Chips with two types of salsa were warm but rather hard.  Much better was a very cold Lump Crab Guacamole app, served with bits of oranges, radish, and jalapenos paired with hard and round but flat fried tortillas.  It was an exciting and surprising mix of sweet and spicy flavors.  A medium-sized bowl of Pozole Soup with Guajillo Broth, Seasoned Pulled Pork, Hominy, cabbage, onions, and cilantro was quite tasty.  Not that I needed it, but I also cashed in a Yelp check in for a Grilled Corn on the Cob with Cotija Cheese and Mayo Butter, which I found to be somewhat sour.  While Diane liked her Baja Burger of a bun-enclosed 1/2 lb. hamburger patty with ham and very tasty skinny Fries, the star of the show for me was a very filling and tasty Carne Asada Burrito containing Pico De Gallo, Mexican Cheese Blend, rice, sour cream, and refried beans.  To top it off, I had it covered with Chimichanga Sauce divided in thirds: Red Sauce, Green Sauce, and Cheese Sauce.  To finish on a cool note, I opted for an order of Fried Ice Cream, which consisted of a large ball of Vanilla Bean Ice Cream covered with Coconut Chips and Frosted Flakes, accompanied by assorted mini-fruits and Strawberry Sauce.  It was a very good ending.  Service was excellent in a convivial Mexican fiesta-like setting, with wood furniture and pinatas swinging overhead.",

What differentiates this spot further from the other many restaurants is genuine hospitality of the host (who could be a double for Modelo Especial beer commercial  check out the picture) and wait staff. They'll actually come around and make sure that you are enjoying your meal or if you need anything else.    We had steak fajita and fish tacos. Generous portions! And our drinks were full at all times. (No, they were not margarita  as we were about to catch a flight.)   5 full stars if corn would be less charred and fajitas meat better marinated. Note: it doesn't mean add more salt.",

    "text": "I've been to the Hussong's in Boca Park and it was a totally different experience when it came to customer service. This one was packed when we got there. It could be because it's on the strip and it was a weekend night, but we needed a place to get a quick bite before our show so we stopped in. We had to end up sitting at the bar because the wait time for a table was pretty long. The bartender we had was not very friendly. Anytime we asked him something, he didn't seem to care much to answer us or get us what we wanted. I guess I can say he at least got our order correct seeing that I had special requests for my different tacos. We had to ask and remind him to bring us our chips and salsa and when we wanted more we just started asking one of the other bartenders and she got us everything rather quickly. I wish she would've been the one that got our tip instead of him.  This place is kind of pricey. We went during happy hour so we just ordered off the happy hour menu since it was cheaper. Their tacos are good. They're kind of small, but good. The chicken one with the pineapple was my favorite. The corn is actually really good too and you can get it for free when you check in on YELP! Between all of the free chips and salsa, free corn and the couple tacos I got, I was more than full and didn't have to spend a lot. They have bottomless drinks too during happy hour. If you can handle at least 4-5 drinks to make it worth it, I'd definitely say to get a bottomless one. It'll save you a lot of money in the long run, if you're buying drinks on the strip.",

The service was attentive and very accommodating; one meal came with really sour tacos and the server was totally happy to take it back and get a new dish (seems we may have gotten the stuff at the bottom of the slaw bowl where the sauce accumulates). I didn't realise it was a sport bar type place and there was one guy, at the table beside us, who was clapping and cheering for some game on TV and it was pretty annoying, but I can't blame him I guess. I really wish that people would get as worked up about actual social and economic issues as they do about sports! Anyway, that's a whole other matter. This is a good reastaurant to go to when at Mandalay Bay.",

    "text": "I may have been pissing out of both ends at the end of the night -- be it from Hussong's or something else I ate during the day -- but Hussong's is a sneaky gem in a sea of mediocre Yelp reviews.  I tend to pass over 3.5 star averages and below on Yelp because I'm a snobby white piece of shit, but I couldn't pass over Hussong's awesome dedicated vegan menu.  First things first, props to Luis (sp?). My girlfriend and I checked in with Yelp for a free shot of tequila, and were told we could only get one -- he hooked us up with two. We also each ordered what is claimed to be the original-original margarita. True or not, it was a meaty boy (that is, high in alcohol) and tasted damn good.   For food I got the vegan breakfast burrito and she got the vegan chilaquiles. We loved both. Luis decided being the best waiter ever wasn't enough, so he brought us out a side of street corn for my girlfriend's vegetarian sister, and a vegan side for the two of us -- limey, salty, delicious. Definitely vegan/lacking non-vegan street corn funk, but good stuff. If that wasn't enough, when we asked what they used for their vegan eggs, he brought out the container (picture attached). Talk about next-level service.   As a last note.. as much as I dislike live music, the Mariachi band here did covers of songs like the Spongebob Squarepants theme song, Elvis, and Lil Jon. That's diversity, and it was actually entertaining.   Hussong's is probably a great choice if you're not vegan, but if you are, it's a must. Strong drinks, excellent food, and crazy good service. Hussong's will be a definite stop from me from now on when I'm in town.",

He has created some special dishes - and I def recommend checking them out!  Amongst them we had the lump crab guacamole, filet fajitas with shishito peppers (YUM) and tempura red snapper with bitter mixed greens salad!  All the dishes were so delish and go really well with their signature margaritas!  They had a really cool 3 piece mariachi band playing everything from Journey to Neil Diamond!  Chad the GM stopped by to check on things and is a really cool guy.  Service, food, music = AWESOME  - how can you go wrong?  Stop on by & enjoy - you won't be disappointed!",

They have a bar if you're in a hurry and a huge dining area as well. The staff is always super friendly and quick. When you arrive and are seated you immediately get complimentary chips and 3 different salsas. The salsas are amazing they have a traditional, a spicy one and a mango flavored one all of them are delicious. I always order a margarita, they make there own mix it's so refreshing. Try to come during happy hour which is mon-thurs 3-6. All margaritas are half off! Last night my friend ordered the chicken stacked quesadilla which was so good! I ordered the enchiladas with cheese sauce it wasn't my favorite but I wanted to try something new. I didn't like the shredded beef and the cheese sauce was not very good. My other friend ordered a chimichanga and that was super delicious one of the best he's ever had and he's from Texas which is home of the Mexican food. They offer a free shot of tequila or a grilled corn so don't forget to check in! I would recommend this place to everyone who likes authentic Mexican food and I will definitely be back!",

The Chef there really knows what's up when it comes to excellent vegan cuisine. I ordered the vegan enchiladas and it did not disappoint.  Well made and very flavorful with a side of spanish rice, chips, a delicious fire roasted salsa and re-fried beans. Wash it all down with a margarita and your set for the day. Also check out other offerings on a dedicated vegan menu. This can sometimes be hard to find in casino settings where most restaurants won't offer a vegan selection but at Hussong's VEGANS ARE WELCOME!",

We weren't that hungry so we only grabbed a few items to share.  Namely, the quesadillas, guacamole, and tortilla soup.  Both were very tasty and delicious.  I really like the chips and salsa here as well.  The food, price, and atmosphere itself warrant a four-star rating.  So why the three-star rating?  The service here was poor.  Upon arriving, we asked for a table to 5.  They said that there was a 20 minute wait.  Ok, no problem.  We decided to sit at the bar.  As we walked to the bar, we noticed four tables in the back that were completely open and setup.  We asked about those tables and they said that they were reserved.  Ok fair.  So we proceed to order and eat at the bar instead.  Forty minutes into our meal, the hostess comes and says our table is ready.  We noticed that the tables in the back were still open.  We kindly declined the table and finished our meal at the bar.",

It might be worth it for happy hour (although you can get much better deals elsewhere), but to actually visit for dinner is a complete ripoff, even with a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificate, which was the reason why we were here.  My husband and I wanted some dinner before we went to see the Lion King in Mandalay Bay, and brought some <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificates to help us decide, so we ended up here.  One of the things that this restaurant prides itself on is the amount of different types of tacos and nachos and just about everything else they have.  So I had the taco plate, a pork taco and a shrimp taco.  And then, they charge about 75 cents per extra item you want on it, such as guacamole, or pickled veggies, cilantro, etc.  Restaurants that do this annoy me to no end.  I ended up getting some tomato and pickled veggies on mine, and for 75 cents each they ended up putting literally a couple of tomatoes and vegetables on them.  Such a rip off.  Also the shrimp were pathetically small and unappetizing looking.  My husband got some customized nachos that looked like one of the most disgusting plates I have ever seen.  Meat and cheese and Mayo type toppings everywhere, it made me just sick looking at it.  My husband was overwhelmed and tried to put a dent in it, but I could tell he wasn't happy with the dish either.  The price, even with our <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificate was still majorly overpriced, and I think we walked out paying 60 bucks.  We really have no desire to go back there, ever.",

    "text": "Stopped in at Hussong's for lunch while staying at Mandalay Bay recently. The decor here definitely has a SoCal feel... stickers for KROQ, The Misfits and The Ramones adorn the wall behind the bar. There is also a pretty large selection of tequila along the back of the bar, telling me that some partying definitely goes on in this place.  All of this made me curious enough to Google Hussong's, which is when I learned that this is their only cantina in the U.S. (the original is located in Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico).  I ordered the four street taco platter, two chicken and two beef, all served on corn tortillas and topped with sour cream, cheese, pico and sliced jalapenos (each topping runs 50 cents extra). The chicken tacos were excellent - probably some of the best I have ever had. The beef tacos were okay - the meat was a little tough, but not too bad.  Service here was great - the bartender immediately welcomed me when I sat down and made me a great bloody mary to start with until my food was ready. She also checked back with me several times to ensure everything tasted okay and asked if I needed anything else.  While I was eating lunch, I noticed on their \"specials\" menu that they serve Chilaquiles for breakfast, something that my brother-in-law got me hooked on that I wish now I would have ordered (I don't find this dish on too many menus).  Overall, the atmosphere here was laid back during the lunch hour, but I get the sense that this place gets very popular later at night. I will definitely be back to visit this place again on my next visit to Vegas.",

Friends of mine and I went for lunch on Veteran's Day this year, and our waiter, Elio was terrible. He started off the experience with enthusiasm, but that quickly dwindled after we placed our order. I had ordered the Taquitos on the appetizer section of the menu. After we placed our order, I noticed that there was a little fold out promotional piece on the table that advertised breakfast burritos. I quickly waved down our waiter and asked him to change it out because the burrito was only $2 more but included a lot more food. It was then the Elio got really awkward. His body language and facial expressions showed he was very annoyed at me for wanting to change my order. He even said something along the lines of, \"Well, umm, they're already making it. But I guess I can go see if I can cancel it. It's just going to take a lot longer.\" When I told him it was fine if it took longer, he again stressed that the cooks were already making it.   Our food came out quickly and it was great! But Elio, I'm assuming because of the order cancellation, avoided us the rest of the time we were there. At one point, he came over to ask if everything was going OK, but he was already walking away as we spoke our answers.   Overall, the service was just terrible and even though the food was tasty, the experience was ruined due to our bad waiter. We won't be going back.",

Oh well, they can't all be winners!  We ordered the nachos, fish tacos, and sopes. Everything LOOKED good, but didn't taste it. The fish tacos were the best thing between everything we ordered. The nachos and sopes were just bland. Prior to the food, they bring out chips and salsa. The chips weren't bad, but the salsa was straight marinara sauce. Borderline sweet! No bueno!   The service was good, and the atmosphere isn't bad. All in all though, there are WAY too many good food spots in Vegas to ever want to come back here. I don't know HOW I missed Burger Bar next door, I saw it as we left Hussong's, I wanted to kill myself.",

It burns, but so good. Has a tangy tomatillo flavor, and then the heat sneaks up on you.  Mix it with the milder salsas and it's still good.  More flavor. Less heat.  The manager's name is Steve.  Very hospitable.  Very accommodating. Same for the staff. Dave and Lacey.  We had such a great time, we went back the next night.",

I had eaten here before when they first opened, I remembered it was average but we were willing to give it another try. There was a mariachi band playing and a football game on the tv at the same time, we couldn't hear ourselves think. The hostess seemed like we were bothering her when she realized we wanted a seat. Staff seemed a bit disoriented. Our waitress was great though, attentive and pleasant, I believe her name was Jessica. They serve free chips and salsa, chips needed salt, the salsas' were gross. We decided to split a steak burrito with cheese sauce...it was so bland. No spice at all, not much flavor going on. It was edible, but should only be served in an old age home.(no offense to the elderly) Oh and my husband ordered a Dos Equis draft, it was flat. We will never go back.",

Anyway, it's a yummy place to stop for chips, guac, and margs while shopping at Mandalay Bay.  The restaurant did not have a lot of frills, rather basic decor, but the food is very good. I had chips and guacamole to start, and the chips were perfectly crispy without being greasy. The guacamole was fresh, and well-balanced with heat and acid. I had the fish baja tacos, and they were very good as well. I loved the avocado salsa.  My friend and I also ordered a pitcher of the original margarita. It was fantastic. No sour mix!! Just tequila (and a lot of it), agave, and freshly squeezed lime juice. These margaritas are very drinkable, but be forewarned, they do pack a punch. I went back to my hotel room after lunch and proceeded to take a nice long nap.  I highly recommend Hussong's as a fun place to stop for lunch if you're in the mood for good tex-mex.",

I can still taste the flavor days after.  Their  guacamole was fresh with an extra hint of lime . The beans and rice and tortilla chips were just excellent this place did an excellent job with the freshness of the food and the tacos were juicy.  The manager Steve was one to check on us he was excellent and everyone had a smile on their face. The service from mr. Luis was wonderful thank you for your outstanding service. Please if your Looking for outstanding Mexican cuisine this place has really set the bar high I will be back.",

    "text": "You had me at margarita.  Claiming to be the first US outpost of Hussong's Cantina of Ensenada, Mexico, which in turn boastfully claims to be the originator of the margarita, how could you walk past this place?  We were in the middle of some hardcore Vegas shopping and stopped for a quick bite to eat to recharge our internal batteries.  Hussong's offers a very relaxed interior, decorated with an obvious nod to Cinco De Mayo with an abundance of skulls that are quirky rather than morbid, the bar staff were warm and friendly, service was fast without being rushed and speaking as someone who normally opts for a booth I'm happy to advise that the bar stools are surprisingly comfortable.  While there we tried the following: Baja Style Ceviche: excellently executed appetizer, zingy and refreshing. Stacked Quesadillas: generously filled appetizer, tasty and packed with flavour. Margarita's: I'll admit, it was me knocking back these beauties as The Hublet isn't really a cocktail guy.  There were very, very good and the more I drank the better they got.  Weird huh.  Great stop for a quick, tasty bite to eat and a must try if you like margaritas.  If their entrees are as good as their appetizers you'll be fine.",

    "text": "While wandering through the Shoppes at Mandalay Bay, I stopped into Lush for a few products, which my husband knew could take an hour (LOVE Lush).  While he waited, he stopped into Hussong's across the mall, and it couldn't have been a happier accident!  After finishing up shopping, I met him for the tail end of happy hour - half price drafts and half price nachos - amazing.  We sat at the bar and the bartender was dry witted and friendly, and we also saw him concoct some super strong margaritas!  The chicken nachos themselves were something that I'm going to be fantasizing about for months to come.  The chips were thick, the chicken was well seasoned, and the toppings were perfectly distributed across the platter.  We consider ourselves Mexican food aficionados, and these were the Holy Grail of nachos.    A few friends met us the next day and we convinced them to come back for lunch, and everyone was very satisfied!  This time we split the mango habanero guac and the ribeye tacos at the suggestion of our previous bartender and were very impressed.    Definitely a great place for happy hour and to watch a game!  This will be on our Vegas list next time we're back!",

I contacted them months ago, knowing that I was bringing my sister to Vegas for her 21st birthday. They went far and above helping me with all the arrangements, for a fantastic celebration. They would respond by email very, quickly to all of my inquiries. And they accommodated absolutely every request I had. Everyone of us stated that the dish we ordered was the best we had had anywhere! One of us, myself, ordered off the vegan menu. It was absolutely incredible and extensive. I could only dream of having something like that in my own area. If you can't find a vegetarian restaurant, then you're making multiple tweaks to an item just to get it dairy free. It was so amazing to be able to order right off the menu, without worrying. We all wish that we had more time there, just to keep trying new dishes at this place. The decor was adorable and fun. The staff was incredible and so are the drinks and food. I just can't say enough positive about this place. I can't thank the staff enough for making my sister feel so special, this is a birthday she'll remember for the rest of her life!",

    "text": "I will state immediately, if you are not a fan of margaritas or staying in the Mandalay than it is going to be hit or miss.  If you are a margarita person, these folks will do right by you.  No frozen BS here.  Their Rita's are on the rocks, including the higher than to be expected quality 40oz special, $18 up front and $13 refills(a quick note to Rita fans, the receipt, if your order is over $40, easy if you get the $18 40z special and a bite to eat I received a $5 off my next order coupon.)  Anyway, food wise nothing I had is going to blow you away(bearing in mind I did get carry out and take this to the room).  It isn't of immense quality, though I found the guacamole of great pedigree.  I had carnitas tacos.  I liked them, in the sense they were warm, moist, flavorful and fulfilled a Mexican niche for $14.  My wife got the simple cheese quesadilla, which I thought were surprisingly good.  Keep in mind, we aren't talking authentic Mexican here.  This is Tex-mex for the masses, which is just fine by me.  To simplify:  If you want authentic Mexican cuisine, look elsewhere.  If you are on the Strip and want a decent Rita and food to match or you are staying at the Mandalay and need a quick Tex-Mex fix it is a solid choice.  If you dig a good, well priced Rita(the closest I've ever had to my preferred 3-2-1 method (than I'd go so far as to say, considering the price) it is a must stop multiple days of your trip.",

    "text": "Ole Hussong's! Wife and I came for lunch on Aug. 16, 2014 and left with full tummies and smiling faces. We initially were taken to a front section table, but I requested a table further back - not a problem, immediately the hostess (with a smile) took us to a back table even though no one else was seated in the back section yet.  Soon after, our server (Kara) came up to give us chips/salsa and take our drink order. Hussong's claim to fame is that they had invented the original margarita way back when in Mexico - and they did not disappoint.  Most of the margaritas are priced $12 to $13, so we opted to share the Romance $20 (a gigantic margarita enough for four people).  When it arrived, it was very refreshing and delicious with a potent kick.  Kara was the ultimate server - always smiling, very attentive and answered all our menu questions thoroughly.  We decided to try the guacamole with our second serving of nachos and salsa and were very glad that we ordered it.  It was very different from any guacamole that we had eaten anywhere previously - very large chunks of avocado and other mystery ingredients that all worked very well together.  Wife had the taquitos which she said was great. I had ordered the Enchiladas Rojas and had opted for one of each (chicken, beef and carnitas).  It came with sides of beans and rice; and everything, especially the enchiladas was so tasty.  As much as I did not want to waste any of it,I could barely finish my meal.  Even the manager stopped at our table to see that everything was to our satisfaction. When we were done eating, Kara noticed that we had almost a third of our giant margarita remaining in the glass, so she took it in the back and came out with two full 'take-out' cups with covers and straws for us to go - no better way to end a great meal than walking around the mall and casino buzzing with the best margarita in hand. I'm sure that there are cheaper places to find good Mexican food fare in Las Vegas.  But for us, considering the location, great ambience (interesting antiques, pictures and decor, and very appropriate background music), the efficiency and friendliness of service and the excellent quality of food, we will be back at Hussong's again on our next trip to Vegas.",

The chips and salsa could have been a meal alone, they were so yummy. The service was excellent, as were my fish and veggie tacos. It is definitely Baja style food but at Vegas prices, which didn't surprise me because it's located in the Mandalay Bay shops. I will definitely be back here!",

It reminded me of canned sauce. In fact, we asked the waitress about the salsa and found out that it also doubled as the enchilada sauce as well as the sauce they put on the wet burritos. Not much effort going on in the kitchen.  We ordered several apps and all 3 of us ordered an entree. I was going to order the tacos, but they were $4 ea for meat only and $0.45 for each addtl topping, so you could easily spend $6 per taco.....and you had to order 4 to get beans and rice....so, for 4 tacos it would cost you about $24.....yikes. The tacos were served on the mini corn tortillas that are about 3\" in diameter.    Our waitress was not very good at her job. The bus boy should've actually been the waiter. She was not very attentive. In fact, we were fortunate enough to have a coupon for a free taco, so we tried one each. When we got the bill, they charged us for the tacos.....  If you are looking for good food, go somewhere else. You can get better Mexican food at taco bell.",

The dinner itself took a long time- our food seemed to take forever to cook and they brought out the wrong order for one of my friends.  If you order the quesadilla, beware the it will arrive looking like a pizza with some chunks sprinkled on top.  The restaurant was loud, mainly because of the trio of singers/musicians loudly serenading the patrons in Spanish for tips.  Unfortunately they came to our table just as our food arrived and probably breathed all over it, delaying our meal even further.  This place is convenient and the food is decent, but don't go for the ambience.",

We initially planned on going to Wolfgang Pucks spot so I was disappointed this was going to be a huge step down. We got seated right away and entertained by a hilarious Mariachi band playing pop songs. Our waitress was adorable, so friendly & accommodating, she overheard us talking about the show and promised to make sure we'd be out in time. I ordered a chopped salad and my boyfriend got steak quesadillas and we were both so pleasantly surprised. My salad was fresh and delicious, only complaint is the dressing was strangely salty, but not so much that I didn't clean the plate! His quesadillas were also delicious. My main complaint was the original margarita I got was no good - oddly strong & had a funky sour/salty taste even though it was not made with sour mix (supposedly only lime agave syrup & tequila). Our server brought us our bill immediately after we ordered so we could eat and run to the show. We'd definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a fast no frills affordable yummy meal. Atmosphere is a bar so be aware of that too.",

The 'Original' margarita is for sure the best margarita in town.  Fresh lime juice squeezed right in front of you and tequila - none of that sugary sweet-and-sour mix.    Their food is excellent as well.  The nachos are great and they have so many additional toppings to choose from.  I've also had the tacos; they now consist of 4 tacos which you can mix and match, and the burrito, both good.  They offer 20% off to locals, which is always appreciated.  Overall, great food, good atmosphere, and excellent margaritas!",

We weren't pushing the culinary envelope or searching for the \"real\" Mexico among mall restaurants, and we were happy with the tacos and flautas that we ordered.  The good news:  It's loud and artificial, but it's fun.  The bad news:  The two salsas that came with the chips were both horrible, and lack of drink prices on the menu is a trap for the unwary.  Pitchers of Sangria were $40, but our pitcher of really good beer was a much more reasonable $22.

The chips and salsa were quite good, but the guacamole was over the top with onions. If you love onions - go for it. If you don't... skip it.

The Margarita menu looked awesome but we did not try it, we know it was a big mistake lol.   We shared the Chilaquiles plate with tofu egg and the Enchiladas with Beef-less tips from the Vegan menu. I am very crucial when it come to fake cheeses but the way everything was put together it blended in nicely. The salsas were great, 4 salsas: 1 pineapple, regular tomato, mango and I believe they're spicy one was and habanero salsa that was less runny probably made with some Olive oil, all salsa were good.   The last part that made this Hussong's great was a trio of live musicians. They were a great touch of humor, class and talent. They played beautifully songs in English and Spanish of any Genre. They made the ambiance fun and were on point with any rendition they played.  From Johnny Cash to Vicente Fernandez to even Beyonce and LMFAO, they played it all and had fun doing it.   Our experience was so great we will be back to eat here when we are in Las Vegas.",

As luck would have it, my bff lives in town so we met up for dinner.  We had no reservation, but walked in on a Sunday night with no wait.  I had no idea that this place had vegan alternatives until I flipped the menu over.  I'm always game to try healthy alternatives to fatty favorites, so the vegan tacos were very appealing.  We ordered the street corn that was so yummy we had to order another to go.  And honestly, we could've eaten that at the table as soon as it arrived and had to order another one to try and make it to the parking lot. It's that good.  I ordered chick'n tacos with some sort of vegan style cheese that were so delicious I was licking my lips.  I washed it down with a skinny margarita.  My bff had an enchilada that she loved so much she was sure she'd have to order another one.    I couldn't believe this little place was that delicious. It may not look like much, but it is HUGE on FLAVOR. I'm not vegan, although I like the lower calorie fake meats that honestly taste pretty much like the real thing.  I will definitely return and can't wait to taste the corn and chik'n tacos again. So yummy. Get in my belly!",

The salsa has a nice spice.  The waitress was nice enough to let me order a half plate of fried shrimp tacos and fried fish taco.  I wish i got just the fried shrmp. The fish was pretty dry and flavorless, it was small and i could barely get through it.  Price isn't too bad sort of a decent cheap place to grab a meal.  One wierd thing that happened was my coworker forgot something behind and we called to check if they were in possesion of it, they put hm on hold for like 10 minutes and then just hung up on him.",

Nachos were a happy hour special, they asked what meat we wanted so we said chicken  but on the side, since one of us was vegetarian. Little did we know, that would cost us $2 extra. Not a biggie, but still. Seriously? That shouldn't be a surprise to your guest when they unexpectedly actually look at the bill you probably don't want them to look at. The Dos Equis were more than expected because apparently the \"special\" at the bar did not apply during happy hour. What the hell!? Still cheaper than they would've been regularly, but that's sort of weird...  They were cool about it though, and we'd go back.",

We had discount cards, offered through my conference, for a free margarita or a free taco.  I got the free margarita, which I really enjoyed (free is good!).  Hubby decided to have the free carnitas taco.  This was a joke!  It was free, so we can't complain much, but it was so tiny.  We had a good laugh over it; I definitely got the better deal with the margarita!    Service was subpar.  We had to ask a few times for our chips and salsa, and my husband never received the drink he asked for.  Speaking of the chips and salsa, the red salsa tasted like marinara... not spicy at all.   Spendy for what you're getting, but they're taking advantage of being in a prime location -- Mandalay Place.  During our stay, we also ate at T&T, which is not far from Hussongs, in Luxor.  I'd recommend T&T over Hussongs.",

The atmosphere is great, all kinds of random/funny things on the walls and around the bar area. They have Mariachi's sometimes, girls with shot bandelos, and handful of flat panel tvs. The staff was very friendly and made us feel like we were regulars. The chips and salsa were on par with Lindo Michocahn's, and the Original Margarita could be the best I've had in Vegas. For food, I had the Beef Tongue (Lengua) Burrito with Green Sauce, and it was extremely delicious. It is a good size portion so I had the last 1/4th the next day reheated and it was still good! The lobster tacos will prolly be my next endeavor there.",

I could vaguely recollect my dad telling me stories of a bar he went to in the '70s and '80s in Ensenada Mexico that was the home of the margarita, and I was delighted to find out this location was the same place! The chips and salsa were amazing.  The chips were thicker than the store bought kind and you could tell they were fresh! We ordered the Queso Bean Dip as an appetizer and it was very tasty! Of course I had to get a margarita and I had the Raspberita.  Fresh raspberries and lime juice with top shelf tequila made this an amazing drink.  No store bought, processed ingredients here. The rest of my party had beer that they said was cold and tasty. For an entree, I had a pork chimichanga, and it was far and away one of the best I have ever had!  Again with the fresh ingredients, and do not even get me started on the amazing guac!  I can  not recall what the other three had, but everyone enjoyed and there was no food left on any plate! I would go back to Mandalay Bay just to eat at this restaurant.  This is what Vegas dining is all about.  On this trip we at a couple celebrity chef restaurant (Gordon Ramsey and Bobby Flay), and this meal blew the others out of the park!",

    "text": "Took advantage of a Travelzoo coupon, thinking it was a good value and hoping to find a new Mexican restaurant hangout now that chef Richard Sandoval's uber yummy Isla restaurant at Treasure Island has closed. Was disappointed the moment I saw the restaurant as it lacked any real ambiance...more like a cookie cutter Mexican sports bar. Still, wanted to give it a chance.  While the original margaritas were decent, the only thing that really stood out was the grilled Mexican corn. The sopes appetizer was hit and miss...the two pulled chicken ones were good but the two carnitas ones were dry and had that reheated fatty carnitas flavor. Ditto on the carnitas platter entree. Baja fish tacos were just OK, nothing like the yummy ones in Baja. Salmon with chipotle sauce was prob the most impressive. But even their Spanish rice was dry and refried beans were spicy but not flavorful.  But here's the kicker, Travelzoo couponers: beware of the 18 percent tip that the management tags on to the bill. While the voucher says the meal doesn't include tip, it doesnt mandate a certain percentage to tip, leaving it up to the customer. When we inquired about this to the manager, he said that we've always added that to the checks. He then went on to say we are the first to complain about it, as if to imply we are crazy for even questioning it. We insisted on him taking it off, which he finally did albeit with an attitude. We left 15 percent, which is what the server deserved.  Again: watch out for the bogus 18 percent tip add-on. And, furthermore, the entire itemized check as our server ended up overcharging us for our meal despite the voucher...tacked on an extra drink! Fortunately, we know to look for that stuff.",

The manager was there watching the baryender, not helping of course, so we asked her again and she said no seating there yet. That is the strangest thing I've seen at A BAR - no sitting at the bar when there are seats available.

It sounded weird at first but apparently the Bone Marrow were these large bone marrows served with sides of chimichurri salsa, onion-cilantro mix and corn tortillas.

We both thought the quessadilla and tortas were just OK while the bone marrow was something to rave about. I like the chips and salsa that we got when we sat down- spicy!",

    "text": "I first started going to the original Hussong's in Ensenada in '73.  I was amused to see that they had opened a place at Mandalay, but my expectations were low, given Las Vegas's tendency to do recreations that are skin-deep at best.  Nonetheless, not having been to the real thing in a few years due to border violence, my wife and I decided to check it out.  As far as the decor and look of the place, they did about as good a job as can be expected.  It has a lot of the touches of the original...albeit with a lack of the grit and wear of years.  The service was pretty good...a young lady named Yolanda was attentive, and friendly, as was the hostess who seated us.  In fact, Yolanda recommended an excellent tequila (although it would be much better if they had a printed list from which to choose).  The food was another story.  (I've eaten in restaurants all over Mexico from resorts to baja joints to Mexico City).The salsas were pretty good, but everything else, the beans, rice, lobster tacos, and carne asada were  bland, and the presentation was weak.  Speaking of presentatioin, the \"toreados\" (jalapenos stuffed with cheese) were sitting on a plate with some mysteriouis brown liquid swishing around the bottom...not very appetizing for an appetizer.  also, the jalapenos should have been deveined and seeded better...as a result they were inedibly hot.  Based on our experience, it was a typical case of another Las Vegas restaurant that knows they don't have to rely on repeat business, because there's a new load of customers coming into town every day. Overall a big disappointment, but I have to give credit to the designers who did a fairly credible job of recreating the look of Hussong's, and the wait staff who were friendlier than a lot of LV restaurant staff.  I seriously doubt we'll go back unless I hear that there have been dramatic changes in the food.",

The chicken fajita quesadillas were really good, great combination, and chicken tacos with rice and beans are up there with some of the best I have had. I will be coming back here especially to try the libations.",

We especially love the roasted corn and potatoes in this dish. A pitcher of skinny margaritas made for a great time. 5 out of 5 stars all day long! See you next time!",

Walking back to the Luxor after a long day of trade show realness I walked past Hussongs and checked out the menu. After a quick back to my room to change and read a few reviews I went back. The wait was minimal, the service was great even though they were busy. The swirl margaritas were excellent. Not too strong but refreshing and just good.  Had a queso dip with the chips and different salsas and also a taquitos appetizer I could have eaten several more. I had the steak chimichanga smothered with the tri sauce recommended by the waiter. It was huge and freaking delicious. My friend had three tacos convo platter. Again this was some of the best Mexican food I've ever had. A rare 5 star from me",

The chef must have been in a frugal mood that day. Lol!!! But the service was great!!!!! Georgiana, our waitress and Amanda, our bartender, were both outstanding!!!!! Service with a smile, attentive, and courteous!!!!    The pork belly tacos, the drinks, and most of all, the wonderful pretty ladies who served us, is what made me give this a 5 star!!!!

I found a little history on margaritas here at Hussongs, but at $25 a throw, i decided to skip the maggie. They had a decent selection of them though. I ordered the 3 tacos, and I was able to mix and match them. I ordered 2 barbacoa, and 1 pork belly. WOW. Dont get me wrong, the barbacoa was good but the pork belly was freaking delicious! Sweet and savory, salty and fatty, it was everything a fat man could want, and more. The waitress informed me that it was her favorite, and when she comes into work its the first thing she eats and always looks forward to them! The refried beans were ok, as was the rice. When you order you get chips and 2 types of salsa, the chips were nicely warm and the salsa's were very mild. I ordered a habanero salsa (it was free) to go with my tacos. OK, i only recommend the habanero salsa to True fire eaters. I couldnt put but the smallest teardrop amounts on my tacos and i love hot food.   The staff! Everyone was awesome, the manager even came over and chatted us up about the chips. The server looked like Laura San Giacomo, but only like 20 years younger and 10 times cuter. She was a real pleasure to have met. If only I was able to turn back time 20 years, so she could properly turn me down.",

So now yelp check-in: every-time you check in, yes, every time you check in you get a choice of free a tequila shot or a big corn... their 1 shot = 2.5 Canadian shots. The tequila they serve is Don Julio Reposado, which is good one.  They something called all day beer happy hour for 15.99$.   Okay lets get over with booze and talk about food.. Vegans- they have a whole vegan menu and whatever I had was super-some!!! Portions are huge!!!   Happy hour menu- 3$ taco! Time to try all of them.   I tried vegan fish and vegan chicken - both equally good. Hubby had normal fish and chicken and he loved both them.  Next visit I tried veggie enchiladas- good!!! For sauce they have a choice of 3 different of a mix of all 3. I tried the dish with all the 3. I liked the green one the most. Enchiladas were 3 filled with grilled onions and jalapenos and potatoes. Served with refried beans and rice. Beans super good!!!  The grilled corn was soooo good. Tender and with perfect Mexican cheese and seasoning.  The service is great , we were served by Sandra and David, both made us feel special.  Oh did I meantime about the complementary nachos and salsa. The portions was too generous and we asked for refills and we got them!!!  Overall a great experience!!!",

Their original margaritas were probably the strongest cocktail I have had so far. They use pint-sized glasses for serving them. Half of the glass is filled with tequila and agave syrup before adding anything else. It wasn't your regular margarita where the bartenders fill up 3/4th of the glass with ice. The service was very personable. The menu was varied and everything we tried ranged from very good to frigging fantastic.   The have happy hour from 3-6 pm everyday where tacos (except seafood) are 3$ each, house margaritas for 6$ each. To top it off, they offer a tequila shot or Mexican street corn free on each yelp checkin (not just the first one).  If only the tooth fairies existed I would glad give my front teeth to have them open a restaurant in GTA, and you would know where to find me most weekends. :)",

    "text": "So... If the service was 5 stars, and my food was 3.5 stars, I think a 4 star review is fair. My margarita was definitely 5 star worthy. But my fiancee wasn't too fond of her food. I'll get to that later...  My fiancee and I got there about an hour before  Hussongs closed. If you check into Yelp up there, you can get a free piece of grilled corn or a shot of tequila. Of course I took the free shot!!! I loved the raspberry margarita too!! It had some kick to it, the margarita wasn't a punk lol  Gerardo, our server, made sure to not leave us hanging. My water was never empty. My chips & salsa stayed full. By the way, I love their pico!! Nice and mild with a sweet touch to my pallet. I was happy with my barbacoa enchiladas. Just a tip, mix the red sauce with the queso sauce. My chicken enchiladas with green and queso sauce was <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a> too!  However my fiancee wasn't too happy with her fish OR carne tacos. She complained about the one shell VS two shells. Her shells ripped because they weren't double shelled. And she didnt like the garnish on her tacos, however she liked the fish in the taco. I liked the tacos personally, but she feels the food is overpriced for the taste.  But, this is my review. The hell with her picky food having opinions! As I'm writing this review eating breakfast, she just complained about her order not being correct. Even though she got exactly what she ordered from the server.  Hussongs is all good in my book. Killer margaritas, with the 1st shot on them. Fun atmosphere. Great service. Good food. How can you go wrong?!?! By not doubling down on the taco shells lol",

I went Sunday night with three other people and we all ordered different things. The table went completely silent once the food came out. So needless to say everyone loved it! When we arrived I checked in on yelp and received a coupon for a free shot of tequila or piece of Mexican Street corn. My wonderful waitress told me that their corn was the bomb , so I chose it and was blown away by how good it was. So if your ever in Vegas and want Mexican food. I highly recommended this place!",

We went to Hussong's on May 25 before watching the New Kids on the Block concert. We had a 6 pm reservation. We were 15 minutes but was taken to our table right away. It wasn't busy yet when we got there. It took about a good ten minutes before we could flag down anybody to our table. A guy in a blue collared shirt came over, took our drink orders and walked away. A female server finally showed up...but went to the table next to us, who was seated a good 10 minutes AFTER  we did. She took their order and walked away. And didn't acknowledge us. Another 10 minutes passed and she FINALLY showed up. No apologies whatsoever. The only comment she said was if we were FINALLY ready to order. Uh, we were ready twenty minutes ago. To the kitchen's credit, our food came out fast and they were really good. We had guacamole, and some of the street tacos.  Too bad we couldn't take the leftovers home with us.  When it was time to pay, we had to flag another server. I think our server disappeared. He brought the bill to us.  I made another reservation for July. Hopefully the service will be better. The food is really good that is why I rebooked. I also made a reservation in two weeks at the Boca Park location.",

Tacos were good too, but would try something different next time.

I found it on YELP, and even our Uber driver, who has driven for years in Vegas... said he never heard of it  This is a great find! It was one of the best meals we had in Vegas, and by far the most fun!  There is a YELP coupon for a free tequila shot or roasted corn.   We all had different entrees, and they were all excellent!  The Mariachi band was phenomenal! They could play anything and so engaging.  Go to the mall, Yes it's Mexican! Have a super time and tasty meal!",

There are several options to choose from, and every time they do them just right. Great chips, great toppings, and just the right amount of toppings. And considering the size of the portion (and the quality of the toppings), the price isn't all that bad. Other menu items are ok, but it is the nachos that keep me coming back.  Now, praise of the nachos aside, I don't care for their margaritas, the service can be spotty, and it can be too loud and obnoxious for me at peak times. But if you come in before the dinner rush, sit at the bar, and order the nachos, it can be just right.",

What started off as a 30- to 40-minute wait turned into an hour, followed by a 45-minute wait for our food after ordering. Service: 0/5.  Our food came, and it was extremely hit and miss. Guacamole, quesadilla, and burger and fries (oddly), all great. Definitely would recommend those. However, the tacos (awful), Mexican and cheesy rices (badly undercooked), beans (off flavors), carne asada (rubbery), and salad (criminally under-lettuced) all were some of the worst Mexican food our party has ever had.  We did manage to get free swag (sunglasses and shirts) from some restaurant sponsors, but that did very little to make up for the $150 we spent on a pretty awful experience. YMMV",

The quesadilla was supposed to have a bunch of fajita veggies including roasted corn and it was just filled with undercooked onions.  The waitress was constantly trying to up-sell us.  The one star is for the chips, which were delicious.  Other than that, it was a bad and overpriced experience.",

The food is fantastic, and they have a Mariachi band that plays Neil Diamond! That's not enough for you? Ok then, they have one of the best happy hours on the strip, a killer selection of tequilas and did I mention fantastic food? I am looking forward to my next visit, there is so much more on the menu I want/need to try. If you find yourself on the south side of the strip stop in, you wont be sorry.

The salsa options (3 options) were good. The vegan menu was hard to choose from. We got the \"steak salad\" and \"chicken enchiladas\" the salad was basic but the steak was great. The enchiladas came with rice and beans which were good but the chicken in the enchiladas were dry and sauce-less unfortunately. I'd love the steak enchiladas a try maybe?! Perhaps may be the best of both worlds. Will come back just bc of the vegan options to try it out once more",

Got the nachos and steak tacos. Mehhhhh I'd rather go someplace for that! So not worth the prices of $14 for nachos and $15 for tacos. I had the original margarita, yest that was delicious, but for a $12 drink? Eh.   On their menu, it says \"If you don't like our service, tell us first not Yelp.\" something like that...well, TOO LATE! For my bottom line here, bad service, over priced food, and good margarita.

    "text": "Upon our arrival to Las Vegas, we were hungry and in the mood for some Mexican food.  I heard Hussong's had vegan options so we headed there.  The restaurant is located in the Mandalay Bay Shoppes.  I was happy to be seated right away and even happier that they had a separate vegan menu.  I scanned the vegan menu and noticed they use Gardein Chick'n and Daiya cheese. I'll have mock meat occasionally but not too often so I opted for the Baja style veggie tacos - double stacked corn tortillas, served with guacamole, breaded zucchini, tomatillo-avocado salsa, and cabbage mix. My boyfriend ordered the Chick'n burrito which had Gardein Chick'n strips, Pico de Gallo, Daiya shreds, vegan sour cream, rice, and pinto beans served on a mix of lettuce and tomatillo-avocado sauce.  We thought the food was ok and was pricey for Americanized Mexican food.  But I get it that it's a tourist spot so a lot of the food is overpriced. I give it 3 stars for food, but since the service was great and they have a separate vegan menu I'm giving them another star.  Our waiter brought our food out quickly and always made sure we had everything we needed.    If I'm ever near Mandalay Bay, I'm glad I can come here for vegan options or I may try their sister restaurant next door Slice of Vegas which also has a vegan menu. Being vegan in Vegas seems pretty easy.",

I never expected such a fun and welcoming experience. The service was great! We were lucky enough to have tried just about every item on the menu. Every item we tried was tasty and captured the spirit of 'the real' food in Mexico.   We started with guacamole and three salsas on the menu.  It was obvious that the guacamole and salsas were freshly made and I was in heaven from the beginning of our gastronomical experience. We continued by having all the appetizers on the menu brought in as tasters. The one thing that was immediately noticeable was the freshness of the food - OMG the corn (Elote Plazero) and the tamales were my favorites. The taste of the corn on the cob was amazing - with Cotija cheese and spicy sauce still make my mouth water - I could not get enough!. The tamal captures the authenticity of the recipes from Mexico. I am South American so their food had me from the beginning to the end. We continued by having platters with the whole variety of the tacos they serve. My favorite were the Lobster Tacos -- All of the tacos had their own unique flavor since the sauces, peppers and salsas were different depending on which taco we were having. The Nachos were huge and loaded with all the goodies you can imagine. We finished with dessert plates which had a little of each dessert on the menu -- I have to confess, by then, I just couldn't eat one more bite -- However, everyone around the table were in heaven...   We had so much fun! Our waitress was fabulous and made herself a part of our gathering as the perfect hostess. The place was jumping and music was playing ~ and our group of executives felt as if we were a friends house. Thank you Hussong's -- We will be back when in Las Vegas! Great Job...",

The burrito was double the size of a Chipotle style and even more tasty. Margaritas are decent price for being apart of the Mandalay Bay chain as well as the authentic tacos.   Mostly a noisy bar atmosphere but well decorated with a great friendly staff.  Good place to catch a quick drink of a meal before heading out on the strip.",

    "text": "This was excellent food and reasonably priced for being on the strip and at the casino mall area.  I ended up eating here twice since the food was so good.  The staff was also friendly, polite, and quick.  The chips were well made, light on the oil and moderate on the salt.  The salsa was thick with nice tomato flavor that was bright, rich, and crisp.  First time I enjoyed the fish tacos. The tortillas were soft and substantial enough to not fall apart on me during my meal.  The fish had a crisp breading with a moist interior that was evenly cooked.  The lettuce was fresh and the tomatoes juicy.  The guacamole was creamy and had a small hint of lemon for freshness.  The additional bonus is that you can order an extra taco or two if you are really hungry.  The second vist I went with a pork burrito \"wet\" style or covered with sauce.  The burrito was large and well filled.  The pork was tender and rich in flavor that was been roasted.  There was also a crisp crust on the pork that added another dimension to the flavor.  The brown mole was thick and rich with a complex smokey flavor that blended well with the pork and the cheeses.  The rice was soft and served as a nice counterpoint to the rich mole and juicy pork.  Side dishes of beans and rice were standard but didn't stand out in my mind.  However, you don't go there for side dishes.  Overall this was excellent food and I would happily return to eat here.  I would probably even travel to get to Mandalay to eat here.",

On the last night we needed to get away from the strip and 104 degree temps.  We dropped the rental car off early at the airport (ok not even close to the airport but that is another Yelp review for later) and headed to Mandalay Place for dinner.  The valet guys recommended the Burger Bar but we needed a margarita or 2 so Hussong's was calling our name!  Having our girls with us, Hussong's was a great choice.  The mariacchi guys came over to play \"its a small world\" for our little Kelly and the experience was off to a good start.  The kids menu was great.  For adults we ordered the chicken street tacos and the beef quesadilla.  Both were excellent.  The service was pleasant but not over-bearing and the margaritas were amazing.  For a resort-area, the tab was reasonable enough.  I think we will be back!   Hopefully the mariachi guys will be there!!",

Even tough we did get chips and salsa, we were waiting so long for service that we went through the chips and had to serve ourselves another basket.   Once we finally flagged down a server, we got to order. The food took at least another twenty minutes to arrive. And three of us just got the quesadilla!   Now, the food. When a quesadilla is on the menu for $8, it's typically enough for a meal. The quesadilla was one corn tortilla with some cheese and like three pieces of meat. It was so small that it made the price offensive -- and it wasn't even that good!   To add to such a bad experience, three of the five people ended up with stomach aches. I would not recommend this place at all, especially given the fact that Burger Bar is next door and is about the same price.",

Beer for $3,50 and THE original Margarita for $6 as well as (one) Taco for $3! We visited multiple times. The food is great for value and the Margaritas have a super taste and are VERY strong! Also our bartender \"the rock\" was great! 10/10 would come again.  EDIT: I forgot to mention the free nachos with two salsas that are just great and the free Tequila if you Check-In via Yelp. Also make sure to get a great T-Shirt for only $10 if you liked!!",

Then we ordered a pitcher of Sangria.  I couldn't decide on what to order, the Tostada, Tacos or Enchiladas. I asked our server, Sandra, what she'd recommend. She said the Enchiladas, Tacos then Tostada, in that order. So I ordered the Enchiladas, one pork, one beef and one chicken, since I couldn't make my mind up!! My husband ordered the Fajitas.  We didn't wait long for our food. The Fajitas looked amazing! The steak was cooked to perfection. My Enchiladas were good, but I wouldn't order them again. The beef one was the best out of the three. They were a bit dry and they could have been hotter.  The steak from the Fajitas was DELICIOUS!  I'll order that next time The Sangria was quite tasty and we got almost three glasses each out of the pitcher. Impressive and worth the money.  The atmosphere was sports bar'ish and there were TV's on all over the place for the Stanley Cup Finals. We enjoyed that!! I'd definitely eat here again...and order the Fajitas!",

The salsa was flavorless, the Chicken in the Chicken Fajitas barely had seasoning or flavor, and my boyfriend didn't enjoy his baja shrimp tacos. The service wasn't the greatest either. Food took forever to come and we felt rushed to leave. I wanted to take some chips to help me eat my leftovers since I ate all my tortilla but the busboy snatched them off the table before I could even put some in my box.

The servers chatted with each other and played with their phones right in front of us. No plates, napkins, straws, boxes for leftovers. They just hung out like they were guests, not employees. So we made a conscious decision not to leave a tip. I am a big tipper usually!! We crossed out the tip section clearly. Today, I checked my bank record and they added a $10 tip anyway. Conveniently, an unauthorized debit charge was made shortly after our trip to the restaurant to a nearby Smith's gas for $150! The bank thinks it's related. They attempted more charges, but the bank caught them. I'm just disgusted.",

We came with 2 omnivores as well and they both got steak fajitas which was a large portion and tasty to them as well.

I believe happy hour was winding down, but the bartender (wish I could remember his name!) saw we were locals and still offered it to us. We each got a margarita on the rocks.   In fact, did you know they are the home of the original margarita? Basically, the margarita was invented by them (obviously not this location, but their first one many, many years ago)! Pretty amazing to have a place like that right here in Vegas! And I could definitely tell they were the makers of the True margarita. Margs are probably my go-to drink and one of my favorites. These were so fresh and so full of flavor. I believe he used real juices in it, too. YUM!  After a few sips of our margarita, we decided to order some guac, even though it wasn't on happy hour. The guac came with chicharrones, which if you have never had them before, you will love them. They are made from pork skin. The way Hussong's Cantina flavors their chicharrones is so good! They put some kind of seasoning on top and it works super well with their guac, which by the way, was not too spicy! Which is great for me, because I hate spice haha :)  When it came time for the check, we saw that the bartender had stuck to his word and let us have our drinks at happy hour cost. He kept reiterating that they loved locals and he hoped we would come back! So kind. We will definitely be returning there!",

First, not only do they have a full Vegan menu- its some of the best vegan Mexican food I've ever had!   Second, worlds best mariachi band. They were singing modern rap & country music alongside classics! It was like getting a full private concert! It was a joy to watch such talented musicians up close!

    "text": "I was not sure what to expect from this place.  I was feeling Mexican so I figured, WHY NOT!?  First, there is a Yelp check-in opportunity for a grilled corn, or a shot of tequila.  I got the corn shaved as I'm particular on my tequila, OMG, it was delicious!  It was perfectly warm with great seasonings, I used it as a dip for my chips, along with eating it as a True appetizer.   I sat at the bar and Phil helped me through my order and took good care of me.   The chips were really good, better than usual, and they came with two varieties of salsa, both were tasty.  Phil recommended the steak chile relleno as an entre, which is far from my norm, but he seemed so enthusiastic, so I went with it.  GREAT pick, it was really good and surprisingly filling.  I had a strawberry margarita which I found to be 'so, so.'  One cool aspect, they came around and served patrons free shots of tequila, and we all did a group toast.  THAT felt like Mexico, better yet, Phil hit me with an additional gratis tequila shot before I left.  Needless to say, I left fat and happy.   I really enjoyed myself sitting at the bar, even made some new friends and watched the baseball game which was on the monitors.  I will definitely go back, and I'll hope Phil is my bartender again.  Cheers amigos.",

More room for us,  but seating can be a bit squeezed in when crowded.    We started out with the fried fish tacos with rice and beans. The pickled red onions,  cabbage with micro greens were the perfect combination with the deep fried goodness. The house salsa they offered were the perfect amount of heat.  They do charge extra for salsa verde.   When happy hour rolled around, we finally decided to do a Yelp check-in for the free elote with all the fixings.  And hot dang,  did they not offer to cut it up for me. The bowl of goodness with the spice,  the pucker from the lemon,  the crumbly cheese and buttery goodness brought me back to my Cali childhood days.   The carnitas tacos- The flavor was perfect and topped with chicharron to give it a crunchy texture.  The meat was tender,  soaked up, but not sloppy with a few dabs of avocado sauce, and again with the onions.  The barbacoa tacos- shredded meat, flavorful and not salty, definitely one of our favorites.   The salted rim house margarita was a nice glass of boozie goodness. Our waitress even salted our to-go plastic cup so we can roam around the casino.   Excellent happy hour prices and the tacos are a must order. This is an awesome place to unwind and enjoy some Mexican cuisine.",

Thurs-Sat they typically have a live mariachi band that's also been a staple of those nights for all these years, so seeing the same people each time is fun.  I won't dig into each and every food options, everything has been consistently good.  The margaritas are fantastic; they're a little on the pricey side, but not excessive, and massively better than the garbage at Margaritaville (with the exception of the Perfect Margarita).  If you want to have a casual group event, this is also an excellent place for that.  My wife and I had our rehearsal dinner before our wedding here, we reserved the back half of the place for about 60 guests and everything went perfectly.  Additionally, given the bathrooms are part of the mall and not part of the restaurant, if you do have a group event that is not the full restaurant, no worries about people coming through your area to use the restrooms because they're not in the restaurant; there's a side door or front door, either gets you to the right place.",

Was greeted with a smile from a nice lady whom was serving (shorts on and a smile) and hosting as we got to the restaurant at open. (Heading to airport after)  She seated us quickly and the warm chips and salsa arrived lightning fast. The salsa I. My opinion was super delicious!!! I ordered a Margarita and THAT was a day maker in itself. We also ordered the cheese dip that was delicious. The stacker quesadilla was easy to decide on as I split this with the boss. A side of fries went nicely with it as that's what she wanted. All in all it was a nice lunch and when I am in this area of Vegas I will look to return!   That margarita was worth it!  Thank you for being awesome!  Kudos out to the entire staff for surprising us with a great experience.  Respectfully, Bryan  Oklahoma City",

Taking a ten present discount ordering in a Macho man voice was the only reason I wanted to eat at this restaurant.  In terms of the flavors, were robust and zesty. The sauces were terrific, but I got a veggie burrito, and it was lackluster. I think this place specializes in meats because there were potatoes in a vegetable burrito. If I had known that my burrito would have lacked rice, bean, guacamole, and vegetables I would have ordered fajitas the people next to me loved there steak and chicken",

The meat was gamey and drenched in a sauce that I didn't care for.  Although tender, the carnitas fajitas were sweet and not really my thing either. The OG margarita was on point with plenty of lime juice and a long pour of tequila. It's not sweet at all - just citrusy.

One was a standard mild salsa and the other one was some sort of chipotle salsa. Both were good and the chips were fresh and crispy.  I ordered a Dos Equis pint ($4 on happy hour). It came out in a reasonable amount of time. There were vegan tacos also available on the happy hour menu, but I chose to go bigger.  I am a vegetarian, and to my delight, I flipped over the main menu and found an ENTIRE page of vegan options! I'm a glutton for anything burrito and chose the vegan burrito ($18.45) with Gardein chick'n and both red and green sauces. It was filled with pico, vegan cheese, rice, beans, vegan sour cream, and micro greens. While the burrito wasn't bad, I felt like it was missing something. Basically, the entirety of its contents were flavorful, but the Gardein \"chicken\" was almost an afterthought. It's like it wasn't seasoned at all and just randomly thrown in.  That being said, the burrito was good enough that I took it back to my room and had the leftovers for breakfast. While this isn't the best burrito I've had, there are several more items on the menu I'd be willing to try in the future.  As this restaurant is located between the Luxor and Mandalay Bay, expect to pay typical \"strip\" prices.",

Mexican food is my favorite and I was really excited after my friend said it was really good. Our waitress was great. She was very knowledgeable and served us chips and salsa quickly. The chips were very fresh and warm. The salsa Verde was amazeballs. I enjoyed the chips and salsa more than my meal. I ordered the enchiladas, two steak and one chicken. Enchiladas are my go to Mexican food dish and it is really hard to mess the dish up so it was not bad, but it was not anything spectacular.   I will probably return on my next trip and try a different dish and a margarita. The menu had tons of different types of margaritas.",

This place was listed under \"late night food\" at the Mandalay Bay's selection of restaurants. We arrived at 12am expecting to satisfy our hunger after coming back to our hotel. Their \"late night\" menu only runs from 11pm-close, which was at 12am. Not only do you get only 1 hour to eat your food, but doesn't late night usually go until at least 2am??  Also, when we arrived at the restaurant, there were no workers on the floor, so we decided to seat ourselves. The TVs were all still on and the small place still had quite some tables eating their food. I figured they were just a little busy, being that they had \"late night specials\". When a staff member finally spotted us, he didn't say anything. We had to ask if we could get menus, only to find out that the restaurant had already closed.  They need to make a \"WE ARE CLOSED!\" sign.",

It is a sports bar, so during our dinner people that were walking by just came and stood right over my husband to watch the game. It is an extremely sad excuse for a Mexican restaurant.",

Literally was not worth $21. The bell peppers and the potatoes felt like they were from a frozen bag. Felt so bland and just plain grade F  food. On top of that they gave me what appeared to be a salsa bowl with rice and beans together. Like wtf?! You can't be serious. Now I'm a big dude and that little salsa bowl of rice and beans wasn't even close to filling up a toddler. The tortillas were even more of a big joke. Felt like paper. They should feel a disgrace to call them self a \"real\" Mexican food. I swear to any god I can find those tortillas at any dollar store. The chicken on the other hand was pretty good. Not disappointed at all with that. I do recommend the house steak however. I came with other friends and saw them with the steak and it looked like an amazing dish. Waaaay better than what I ordered and cheaper too. Over all don't get there fajitas.",

When I first walked in there was a Taco Cart...nice!!!  There was a choice of pastor, chicken or steak.  I got two steak tacos to start.  The steak tacos were really good.  I also heard people raving about the pastor but I am not a big pastor fan.  I also went to the bar and asked for a Margarita.  I also told that bartender that I did not like the mix and I was able to get mine made with fresh squeezed lime.  That makes me and my stomach happy!  The staff was very fast getting drinks even thought the place was packed from wall to wall.  I went in back to check out the buffet and picked up a taste of everything.  The food was really good and it had been sitting for a while in the heating trays.  I would love to come back here and order off of the menu one day!  My favorite part of the whole night was the Mariachi Band...these three guys were the Mexican Version of the Three Stooges.  They were so funny and they played every and all requests.  Our whole group was laughing so hard.  I asked for some Pink Floyd and they started playing Brick in the Wall.  I kept thinking...what have I done but the room loved it.  These guys were so much fun.  I asked at the front and they told me that these guys play on the weekend.  I really want to come back and listen to these guys again!!!  There was also a cardboard cut out of the Dos Equis Guy...if you angled the camera correctly it kind of looked like he was real.  In fact, a few people of facebook thought he was real and were surprised when I told them he was really cardboard.  We all had a good time...I wish I could have stayed longer but I had to get up early for work the next morning.  I hate when work gets in the way of free food and drinks in Vegas!!!",

There was about 2 tablespoons of beans and rice (tasted like box rice) and they were both gross.  My chicken enchilada possibly was the worse I ever had.  The chicken seemed to be a grilled breast that they rolled into a tortilla and put canned sauce on it. Huge chunks of dry chicken does not make for tasty Mexican food.  The taco was ok but greasy and the taquitos was drenched in crema.  I am so glad that I had a coupon because if I paid 52 dollars for that pig slop I would have been pissed.",

Our server stated their usual queso has beans in it and we wanted plain queso. She brought it and it was as runny as milk and not very hot. I am used to small family Mexican restaurants that serve hot from the oven homemade chips which these definitely were not. They were not hot or homemade and were very thick and hard to bite into. When my tacos came, they tasted pretty good but the rice and beans on the side were not hot and tasted like they were from a can/flavorless. I asked her for a side of guac and she said they have a mini cup for $3. They are supposed to make homemade guac. What she brought was a tiny condiment cup of watery green liquid. Wtf? I tried it and it was more like hot green chile sauce - definitely not guac! I wish I had not wasted my time here that night and gone to Slice of Vegas a few doors down for a consistently good meal for way less money! This whole place was just a real disappointment all around.",

My husband ordered 3 carnitas tacos, he only ate 1 1/2 and had to leave the table, he immediately became sick. Our other friend ordered one of each, he ate one, (carnitas) and about 30 min later also became sick. This is just a terrible place to eat!! I do not recommended. However if you want some good margaritas, this is the place to go.",

Don't go overboard and order much more if you order shrimp or fish tacos.  They are more filling than you'd think.  Obviously, you'd have to eat the rice and beans as well, which I did.

Whether that is True or not, is irrelevant, because the margarita's/drinks kicked @$$!  The drinks are not too expensive ($10-$12 range), but they still pack a nice punch.  Most drinks in Vegas are extremely watered down and 90% sugar, but not these.  They tasted fresh and did not resemble Kool-Aid.  For food, we enjoyed the quesadilla, which had tons of flavor, but was also very heavy.    Cons: The service was not good at all.  The servers were extremely friendly, but also extremely absent.  Maybe I caught them on a bad night.  I will definitely look to come back here next time I am in Vegas, though.",

As for the margaritas, the waiter raved about the house margaritas so we gave them a try. Needless to say we were very disappointed.   The one bright spot in the evening was the mariachi trio that strolled through the restaurant. They were great and very entertaining. It would be worth it just to sit at the bar with a cold beer and listen to those guys play.",

    "text": "So we were pretty exhausted and staying in one of the conjoined hotels and Hussongs was just easy. And we're Texans and were craving some Mexican food.  I came with a party of 5, all hoping for really good Mexican food. It was definitely not bad. But I can't tell for sure if I really felt that way or was just really tired/hungry.  I was wavering between four and three stars to this point but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and go four.  The chips seemed authentic. They were the thick homemade style which I love. The salsa left some to be desired which was a major bummer. Salsa can make or break a Mexican restaurant in my humble opinion.  I ordered some kind of trio combination plate as I was feeling pretty indecisive. I believe it had an enchilada and taco both with meat of choice and a beef flauta. Rice and beans of course. It was good!  I would go back. I would probably try something different as I wasn't wildly pleased with my entree.  My husbands quesadillas looked and tasted pretty amazing. Just a basic chicken one off the appetizers I believe. I might go that route.  Overall we had really good service and enjoyed the food. I would recommend trying it.",

It was a little further away from the conference rooms since it was on the upstairs portion. But it was worth the run. I ordered to-go at the bar. The bartender was great, he put the order in quickly for me. I was ordering for myself and others so I asked for a lot of salsa and he got two huge containers that he filled for me. This was convenient to carry in the bag without spilling. The food came out within 10 minutes and was very good. The green salsa was delicious-don't forget to ask for some.   The pricing was actually pretty good too in comparison to everything else around there. The taco plates came with three tacos, rice and beans. They're $14 and very filling. Most of the other places I ate at in Mandalay were closer to $25 and were often less filling.",

I have tried almost every margarita they have there and you can't go wrong with any of them. The PB and J one is one of my favorites there. Try the BBQ pork quesadilla!

    "text": "Came here for dinner on a Friday night which was probably our first mistake since it was Friday night of March Madness.  Now... if you're looking for a loud, fun, entertaining time and you're staying at Mandalay Bay... this is a pretty good option.    But if you are looking for good food, a nice relaxing meal with a bit of flair and creativity....  and great margaritas... go to Border Grill.    This place is pricey and the food is just ok... and it's loud so if you want to have a conversation you'll be yelling most of the time.  The chips and salsa...  chips were a little stale... but the salsas were fresh.  Really like the creamy tomatillo salsa... it was tart but had a kick all while being creamy.    We ordered the ceviche to start along with a pitcher of Pacifico and a blackberry muddled margarita.  The margarita was ok... I've had better so I only ordered 1... you could barely tell there were any blackberries in it.  The ceviche was small... had good heat and flavor... the odd thing was that it had cucumbers in it... good thing I like cucumbers.  The pozole... very tasty and hearty.... We all shared this... If (big IF) I go back... I'd order this and a beer.  It was comfort food in a bowl.  So Good.  Dinner...  My girlfriend ordered an Arugula Chicken salad (she's on a diet so her splurge was cocktails)... but the Arugula turned out to be Spinach... not a big deal... but they should have told us of the menu / ingredient change. My entree was the Harache?  ... flat steak grilled with a chimichurri sauce on top of what was supposed to be a crispy tortilla... it was actually a soggy flatbread... I didn't eat the flatbread tortilla... but the steak and chimichurri was Great! Hubby got the taco plate... wasn't anything special. GF's hubby got the flautas... they were big but he said they were dry inside and only ate half.  For the 4 of us... 2 pitchers of beer, 1 margarita and 2 vodka cocktails... (plus the food mentioned above)... our total was $205 including tax and tip.  IMO... overpriced for what we got... Although, I'm pretty sure the bar tab was more than our food tab since drink pricing on Strip tends to be high... so...   BTW.... did I mention the mariachi / roaming cover song band is loud and kinda obnoxious?  I found them annoying so this is one of the main reasons I won't go back.  But if you're drunk and looking to sing along off tune this would be a great place to hang.",

    "text": "What a way to start a visit to Vegas!  My sis and I chose Hussongs Cantina for lunch before our shopping marathon.  We needed good food and my Frankenfoot needed the margarita.  The have 2 showcased margarita's - their original is handmade from top to bottom so that's the one we opted for.  It was strong & delicious.  We both ordered the lobster tacos for lunch and started with an order of handmade guacamole.  The guacomole was good and their chips are thick - almost like pita chips crossed with flour tortilla chips.  But that made them nice and sturdy for the guac :)  The lobster tacos were a bit stingy with the lobster.  And they were those Langostino lobsters that are kind of like the midgets of the lobster world.  But the creamy Mexican cheese on top made the flavors delicious.  And we both ate our 2 tacos with smiles on our faces.    We sat at a tall table in the bar and our bartender/waitresss, Cheri, was great.  Everyone was really friendly and the atmosphere was fun.  My only complaint (other than the stingy lobster) was that the hostess walked pretty fast for someone following her on crutches...  That didn't seem too cool.  But the marg's and food were just what the doctor ordered!  ;)",

They aren't lying when they say their motto is \"less ice, more tequila!\" We came during happy hour and got the strongest margaritas we have ever had, for a fair price. So, the drinks were great; the food was good. Complimentary chips with three kinds of salsa add interest and variety, and the quesadilla deal during happy hour isn't bad either. I've had better quesadillas but honestly the atmosphere here is more like a Mexican sports bar than a restaurant, and taking that into consideration: the food is good and fairly priced, but you should come for the drinks mainly.",

My friend W had the Skirt Steak Chile Relleno, which was a nice-sized entree for $16.  I had a bite, and the steak was tender and the pasilla sauce was flavorful.  I went with the Grilled Corn app to start - amazing char, creamy mayo-butter and cotija cheese, then a zippy punch of hot pepper flakes (get this damn app!!!) - and the Tortilla Soup.  My meal came to $14, and I was very, very pleased.  So, while we're sitting there in comes a couple women with Vegas showgirl headdresses and gowns, some fat cat businessmen, and 10 hot chicks in short, black dresses.  They flourish a Victoria tap handle and holler 'free Victoria beer for everyone!'... and the hot chicks start passing out tall glasses.  Woohoo!  It was a fun evening before that, but free beer (with a 2nd free beer brought out because my friend W sweet talked the closest hot chick) made for a great last memory before heading to the airport for our redeyes!",

The wait staff is super attentive and I never had to ask for a refill on my drink.    If you're not super hungry, their happy hour has a ton of delicious appetizers to choose from as well as several drink specials.

Our waiter never came by to see how the food came out or anything, we had to ask another employee to get him to get our check. The only good thing about this place was the dynamite shrimp it was very good, but the service was horrible, the manager was atleast nice gave me another drink and some vouchers for free margaritas even though I never asked for anything. Just a disappointing experience.",

I usually avoid Mexican restaurants on the Las Vegas strip because of previous bad experiences.  Over priced/watered down margaritas, food had small portion sizes, extra for chips and salsa.  I experienced NONE of these issues at Hussong's.  The decor was fun and funky Mexican straight out of the best tourist areas of Mexico.  The margaritas were awesome, and reasonably priced.  The food was also very good and reasonably priced.  Portion size was good.  Chips and salsa was free, as it should be at a Mexican restaurant.  The also had a Mariachi band playing while we were there, and they were very good.  Looking forward to my next visit to Hussong's.",

    "text": "First of all, major kudos for offering a dedicated and extensive vegan menu in addition to your regular menu. There were so many items that I wanted to try, but my tummy wasn't big enough for all the vegan things... Next time.  My family was staying at the Mandalay, so it was honestly veggie luck that Hussong's was just a few steps from our room.  On the first visit, I got the Fish Baja Tacos. The tacos were good, but it appeared that the Gardein fishless filets were 1/2 the normal size; I may have gotten 1 or 2 bites of the filet. It was basically a cabbage taco. Also, I tasted, and subsequently saw, vegan cheese inside my tacos. I do not like cheese; vegan or otherwise. The menu does not list cheese in the description, so that was perturbing.  (Side note: it is not listed in the menu description, but this dish also comes with beans and rice.)  On the second visit, I got the Chile Relleno with the Gardein Chick'n strips. This dish is supposed to come with mixed garlic, onions, tomatoes, carrots, and potatoes, then topped with Daiya (vegan cheese) shreds and avocado, served over a tostado with beans and rice.  I requested no tomatoes or cheese. What did I get? Well, I got the open poblano pepper with \"chicken\" strips, tomatoes, avocado slices, a mystery sauce drizzled atop, and the tostado, which was surrounded by a mole sauce. The garlic, onions, carrots, and potatoes were no where to be found. This is a $17 dish. I am going to need them to not omit 1/2 of the ingredients. I picked out the tomatoes and the remaining dish was good, but I wanted the rest of that darn filling!    The beans & rice, however, were excellent. They were among some of the best and most flavorful vegan rice and beans I have ever had.    I'd love to give some of the other menu items a try, like that Habanero Guacamole dish, and the Sopes.  But the kitchen needs to make sure they know what does and does not go in their dishes, and/or update the menu descriptions accordingly.   They were open from 11am-11pm. Carry out orders need to placed at the bar, or you may call ahead. Hussong's Cantina is located in the Shoppes area. If you're at Mandalay Bay, simply follow the signs for the Shoppes. It's just a short walk after you've exited the escalators. If you reach Lush, you've gone too far.",

    "text": "Where do I even start? I was with a group of six and we all decided to try something new, so we walked over to Hussongs Cantina outside of Mandalay Bay. We were seated right away because well there was no one else eating there. This should have shot red flags in our heads right away.   We were brought water right away, however we waited about 10-15 minutes to even have our drink orders taken. Our waiter took our order after about another 5-10 minutes. Another worker brought us chips and two kinds of salsa. The chips were actually very good. The salsas were more of a smokey paste. No one enjoyed the salsa, so we just ate the chips. I would like to add that all of us have grown up on authentic Mexican food and this was not it.   Finally our food comes out. Three people ordered the nachos, One order enchiladas, another a burrito and I ordered a plate that included chicken, chorrizo, carrots and tortillas covered in queso. The queso was more of a solid that a liquid, it actually took me the whole meal to figure out that it was the queso. Not one person finished more than half of their meal, It was HORRIBLE. One girl took one bite and shoved her plate away.   Now, I can forgive less than wonderful food if I have great service. The last time we had seen our waiter was when he took our order. He never checked on how our food was. Another one of my friends was missing part of her meal and never got it because no one ever came by. We saw the water lady 3 times as much as our own waiter. Let me remind you that NO ONE was in the place so it was not like he was very busy with tables.   FINALLY, he swings by the table and we ask for the bill. Four of us paid in cash, we told him to split whatever was left on the bill after the cash on the two cards. He walks aways, comes back about a minute later and throws everything on the table and says \"I don't understand, I don't know who's money goes with what\" We didn't care if every person paid for specifically what they had, we just wanted out. So he goes through our tab with  us and splits it up specifically even though we told him to just use the cash then with the remainder of the bill, split it equally on the cards. He comes back with six bills. Clearly this was too hard for him. We paid and RAN out of there.   THE WORST PLACE I HAVE EVER EATEN AND THE WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER HAD.   We would not even step foot in there the next night when they were giving out free shots, that says a lot.",

Even though the restaurant was a little busy, our service could have been better. We weren't given straws and when I asked for straws our server forgot and never came back (I finally just got them from the bar). By the way, the water tasted weird, which is pretty concerning.   I'm also annoyed because my friend is a vegetarian and we are both health conscious so after coming to yelp to write the review, we find that they have a separate vegan/vegetarian menu you have to ask for. This would have been nice to know. (Grrr!)  I will say their gluten free chips and salsa are delicious but one can not live off chips an salsa alone. We both had the tostado salad and were very surprised to see what came out or lack there of. The salad was supposed to come with black beans and corn, which were nearly hidden the portion was so small. We could never even taste them! We expected some other veggies like peppers or onions too but we really just got some lettuce on top of two fried tortilla pieces. The chicken was dry and since my friend didn't even get the chicken or cheese, I felt worse for her. Bottom line this should not be considered a meal. Very disappointing.",

We drank a couple Dos Equis on draft, then my husband switched to PBR and I got a Modelo Negra. Not a lot of beer selection, but at a Mexican cantina, they have what you're looking for--Corona, Tecate, Dos Equis, Modelo. We split the nachos with steak, and they were wonderful! The best part about them, which I didn't even notice at first, was the grilled corn. So sweet and smokey, and nice addition to standard nachos toppings. We also had chips and salsa while we were waiting on our nachos to come out. I highly recommend. They come with two salsas, one red, one green. Both were fantastic, and whether or not it is, everything tasted homemade.",

Ordered a Margarita and some chips and salsa to start myself off. The margarita was made well with a generous pour and lots of fresh squeezed lime. Delicious! The chips also came with 3 different salsas which were quite good. While waiting for my food the bar tender kept telling me these random stories which I found to be hilarious, did a great job killing time before the food came out. Then it was time for the good stuff, the tacos. I ordered one with cabeza, one with lengua, and one with goat. The first two were very good, very delicious, but I found the goat to be a little tough. The tacos were very good and bonus points for  having lengua and cabeza on the menu.  Would go back in a heart beat",

We do not eat meat and were thrilled to see they had many options available to us. Also after arriving and talking to our server she told us there were other things she could have the kitchen make without meat that further expanded our selection. The food was awesome hot, flavorful, fresh and fast. The server was quick, super friendly, and very very accommodating going out of her way to ensure our dietary issues were met. Had the tacos my wife had a salad, margaritas were awesome I had a traditional and she had the cotton candy margarita(which actually has cotton candy in it). Everyone here goes out of their way to make sure your experience is a good one I would highly recommend this place to anyone and really for the price I couldn't have been happy I have plunked down far more money in vegas for a far less pleasant experience.",

I went to Hussongs with a bunch of my buddy's as we were just looking for an inexpensive start to a long night.  What we got was the best margaritas, good beer cheap, outstanding Mexican food and cute waitresses and bartenders.  Our intention was to start the evening there and move on to a club after a few drinks but ended up closing the joint down after many shots of tequila!  If you have ever been to the original in Ensenada and had as most do, an unforgettable experience, I can tell you that this place does the original justice.  With a motto of \"More Tequila, Less Ice\", it is tough to go wrong.",

I'm the type of person who has trouble making decisions, luckily the bartender (super hot tattooed girl) was great at making decisions for me. She guided me towards the classic margarita (soooo delicious!) and the enchiladas. The beans and rice are not vegetarian, but they accidentally ended up on my plate so she got me this white rice, which was alright, but the enchiladas were really good. It took a few minutes for them to correct the wrong beans and rice, which meant they actually remade the plate, yes! Their chips are thick and the red salsa has a bit of a kick, salsa verde was good too. Overall great service, we stopped in for another margarita before we headed to the airport, they are just so good! The bartender was very friendly, we will definitely be stopping in on our next trip to vegas!",

Yes, they have all the standards you come to expect at Mexi restos (fajitas, burritos, tacos, margaritas, etc.)... but, with all the fantastic Mexi places we can choose, Hussong's misses the mark.  While the Shrimp Fajitas (nicely spiced shrimp and assorted veggies, though missing the sizzle that I was hoping for...) and the Grilled Corn app. (this dish was fantastic -- perfect combo of sweet corn, char from the grill, and spice with their mix of add-ons) were tasty, the ceviche (probably our fault for ordering ceviche at a Mexi place) and the starter chips/salsa left much to be desired.   One shout-out (and special star) should go to our server-extraordinaire, Cameron Shane, who was really friendly and willing to go the extra mile to help us out.  Bottom line: relatively inexpensive food for strip fare, but expect moderate Mexi food.  And, if you're able, sit in Cameron's section!",

The enchiladas were good, but they seemed a little dry to me.  It would have tasted better topped with some guacamole.  The chips and salsa are very good, I loved the green salsa!  The red spicy salsa also wasn't bad, but the green salsa was amazing!  My friend ordered the street tacos which he said were delicious.  The flautas are also very good.  This is definitely a bar atmosphere, the seating is not that comfy and there aren't a whole lot of tables.  They also don't have a restroom inside the restaurant; you have to walk down the hall to the public restroom.  Not a bad place to satisfy you hunger cravings, or if you need a cure to a hangover.

The only good thing about the stale chips was that they were free. They didn't bring them out until after we had ordered and were finished with our first round of drinks and brought one basket for a table of nine. Salsa was decent, especially the verde. I ordered the dorado lobster tacos. Very little lobster which was under-seasoned. Beans were bland as was the rice and they wouldn't let me substitute soup or salad which was what I wanted anyway. Pretty average. Staff was friendly but distracted. They comped my friends meal without her having to ask when she found a hair in it. Service was friendly but distracted. They clearly need a dedicated bartender and not a waitress that has to bartend for all her tables. Did I mention they put salt on my mango margarita?",

The mall between the two resorts has several nice places like this.   The service here was very good. Again... I ate at the bar. When I'm alone I like to eat there because I can meet some folks.   I have their Skirt Steak Chil Rellenos.  Apparetnly the bartender had just ordered this for the first time himself the night before and we both now agree. It was amazing.  The combination reall hit the spot for me.   I will probably find a way to get back here and order it a again if I stay at Mandalay.",

Granted this place won't knock your socks off with fusion mexican - if that is what your're looking for, go elsewhere. Nor does it claim to be, this is simply good standard mexican fare at Vegas prices (yeah that means more people!).  Highly recommend nachos with your choice of meat.  Also, verde pasole if available is terrific.  Red pasole works well too, - curing those Vegas headaches before heading out to the pool or back to the tables!",

    "text": "This place has been the best place we've dined at thus far in Vegas. It's definitely different Mexican cuisine and I love me some Mexican food. We got the grilled corn plazero appetizer and I la-la looooved it! Totally reminded me of the corn carts back in LA. Chips and salsa were okay. I say that because I am a chips and salsa snob and I thought the chips were a little too salty (but the perfect thickness with the perfect crunch), the salsa verde was too salty, but the house salsa, which our waitress said may be a little spicy but was not, was perfect. I ordered the Mexican burger. It was delicious except it really should have had some sort of spread or aioli on it. It was like a brunch burger and I love me some brunch burgers whenever I can get my hands on one. The best part was the fries. Fries with seasoned cotija cheese. Oh. Em. Gee! I'd go back to this place just for the fries! Portions were huge so I pretty much took the entire plate back to my hotel (we had a fridge). Leftovers were just as good!  I felt that the service could have been a lot better. Our waitress decided that since we were spending tons on alcoholic beverages that she didn't need to bother asking us if we needed soda or water refills or even chips and salsa refills. Price wise, this was priced the same had we hit up the More Buffet at Luxor again, except the food was better and I wasn't visiting the bathroom every half hour.",

    "text": "Wow! Perhaps my review is extra good because I had no expectations for Hussong's.  I'm not the biggest Mexican food enthusiast - don't get me wrong, I like it at times, but I don't crave it regularly the way other people seem to. My best friend had a gift certificate for it, so we decided to check it out.   We were promptly seated.  The place was pretty crowded on a Thursday evening around 8pm.  Our waiter brought us these delicious warm chips along with 2 dishes of salsa.  We also requested their extra spicy salsa that he brought momentarily - I could have filled myself up on the chips and salsa alone as all 3 assortments were delicious! I proceeded to order the El Pepino margarita (jalapenos and cucumber).  Maybe I got lucky, but it was one of the best margaritas I've ever had. For the main course, I ordered their combo meal which included a steak quesadilla, corn, beans, rice, and chile relleno.  I don't know what they did to that damn corn...but it was some of the BEST corn I've ever had! That makes 2 bests in one meal! The steak quesadilla was excellent as well.   Overall, we left feeling very pleasantly surprised, happy, and full! We will definitely be returning :-)",

    "text": "This stop was the highlight of my 4 day trip to Vegas which is saying a lot. I found out ahead of time that they had recently started a vegan menu, it wasn't posted online, but a quick email got me a copy of it. Prices were high as is to be expected in a Vegas hotel mall, but it was so tasty and the service was great. I am in love with the salsa here and love any place that brings you more than one variety. Plus the chips were slightly thicker than usual which made them extra delicious. I'm sure my giant margarita didn't hurt anything either. Mostly though I must rave about my vegan enchilada which came with gardein and daiya and the most delicious sauce. These types of mexican meals are being much more common as easy to make vegan food becomes accesible via these already manufactured product mainstays but this was still better than any similar enchilada I have ever had. It was so tasty that I decided to carry the rest of it around in a bag for the next 5 hours before finally eating it standing over a trash can on fremont street. The menu had a lot of other great looking vegan items as well, including a chili relleno, which I have never seen before. My boyfriend enjoyed his non vegan variety. I will definetetely be adding this to all my future Vegas vacations and can even say it was worth the 2 hour duece ride from my hotel on the opposite end of the strip.",

    "text": "I've been here about three times. Some things are good, some things suck. For example, this place claims to be the Home of the Original Margarita (apparently created in 1941).  Just goes to show that time can improve upon almost anything... because their margaritas suck!  They are super sour and not much tequila.  I also hate mai tais from Trader Vics.  Original does not mean good, people!  But the food here is actually pretty unique if you are adventurous.  It is high quality food and the price reflects that (e.g. $4 per taco, which are small street tacos).    You can get bone marrow tacos (which I actually would not recommend), beef cheek tacos (which I do recommend if you like gamey flavors) and tongue tacos (gotta try everything at least once - and not too bad!).  Just keep in mind, the portion sizes are seriously small and they charge extra for things you normally wouldn't expect, like getting diced tomatoes and lettuce on your tacos.  I mean seriously, 50 cents for lettuce on my tacos!?! That better be some seriously good, mind-blowing lettuce.  Just make sure to ask a lot of questions about portion size and presentation before ordering so you aren't surprised or disappointed.  For example, as other reviewers have said, the nachos are basically individual chips with the nacho toppings expertly placed on them.  Not the typical huge plate of tortilla chips covered in toppings that we normally associate with bar food.  One thing that is great about this place is the mariachi band.  They are hilarious!  One of them has a harp!  They play a great variety of songs and occasionally call for audience participation, which can score you free drinks.  My friend and I were the loudest at yelling \"TEQUILA!\" during the Tequila song which scored us free tequila shots.  Also, the chips and salsa are free and are both pretty good! Despite the fact that the chips come out of what appears to be a popcorn machine.  Keep an open mind, stay away from the margaritas, be prepared to shell out a bit more than you normally would, and make sure you come here when the mariachi band is playing (call ahead).  Then you will have a good time!",

I could only get through half of it, the mix was so sugary. The server did remove it from our bill without us even having to ask. Which was a plus. Then as everyone was watching the football game they brought out the mariachi signers. It became so loud you couldn't hear the person next to you. On top of it all as the staff is running back and forth they would repeatedly hit the back out our chairs. It was just over all bad.",

We were pleasantly surprised! We sat at the bar and had a great bartender (a female) who made our margaritas the way we wanted it.  She did not use any sour mix. It was real ingredients using lime juice, which you don't get going to a place like TGIFridays.  We got a great buzz. We had the ceviche and chips and salsa. I was told the chips were gluten free. They were yummy, but be forewarned. It was so hot (ceviche and salsa) that I needed milk to swish around my mouth, and was chugging water.  Whew! Would like them to take it easy on the spiciness! Worth the pain though.",

    "text": "Came here before a concert at the Mandalay Bay Beach one Saturday night. We had reservations for 8 at 6:30pm, so it was fairly early for dinner Vegas style. We had a vegetarian and vegan in the group and everyone loved their meals. It was great carb loading before a heavy night of dancing and drinking.   Their vegan menu is done well, not just chips and dip and a veggie taco. Veggies have a full separate menu to choose from with a great variety of apps and entrees. We also had some food allergies in the group as well and our server, Ronnie (I think was his name?) was a star. He literally ran back and forth to the kitchen and back to our table to make sure he was giving us the right information on what was included in the meals ingredient-wise.  Drinks were delicious and ever flowing. The skinny pom margarita was fantastic although a bit too sweet for me, as was their OG margarita. I had the steak chile relleno which was flavorful and not too heavy. I saw someone at the far end of the table with a burrito the size of a nerf football though...noms for days.   The live mariachi band serenaded us with Sweet Child o Mine and \"going to the chapel\" since it was my friend's bachelor party. What a fun group of guys.   Decently priced for Vegas, generous portions, fun, casual atmosphere and nice staff. It was a great mid way meeting point for both budget and taste and I would definitely come here again. I'm addicted to their chips and salsa. Guac wasn't bad either!",

They give you a green and a red salsa which I appreciated.   We were able to order enchiladas and tacos ala carte even though they are not listed  on the menu like that.

We were seated promptly but then waited a ridiculous amount of time to even be acknowledged. My friend eventually had to pull aside a busser to ask him to get a server over to us. When he did come over there was no apology for the wait which was disappointing. Since it had been a while we were all ready to order so we did so right away. They brought us tortilla chips and salsa and the chips were actually delicious, easily the best part of the meal. I ordered a glass of white sangria and it was simply not sangria. Basically white wine with lemons, limes, and cherries, no juice. For dinner I had the salmon, which was mediocre. My friend said his burrito was horrible. We all left food on our plates which is not a good sign. I'm torn between 2 and 3 stars but rounded up because I'm feeling generous. I don't see myself eating here again.",

We were immediately greeted with a free basket of warm tortilla chips and two types of salsa; the tomatillo avocado salsa was particularly tasty. We split an order of nachos and each grabbed a traditional margarita - all of which were half price for happy hour. Everything came out very quickly. The nachos were admittedly a bit small, but I think that can be excused since these are possibly the best nachos I've ever had. Delicious chips that were piled high with chicken, beans, corn, and veggies, with sour cream and green salsa drizzled on top. The margaritas were tasty and particularly boozy.  Great place, would definitely come back.",

The bartenders are so friendly. Jon and Phil, they gave us a ton of suggestions of fun things to do while here in Las Vegas. There were two managers working Steve and Andrew, they both came and chatted me up. This place is awesome. The food was phenomenal. The corn was the best corn I have ever tasted. My friend literally said, \"who even makes corn this good?\" I will definitely be back! Oh yeah, and there are Mariachis! Hahaha fun",

We had the mango habanero guacamole, which was unbelievably good and done chunky style... The only acceptable way. I got the vegan stacked quesadilla, which was so gigantic that I took half of it home. Super flavorful, you get an option of what protein to choose so I went with vegan chicken. So, so good. Boyfriend had pozole; he's a carnivore and wants to get it again. Today is my 30th birthday so we are going in a few minutes... Currently sitting at burger bar which does not have anything for vegans besides one sandwich which I'd prefer not to get. One can only eat so many grilled vegetables on ciabatta bread... it gets trite.  Oh yeah, they have vegan breakfast as well. 11 bucks for a packed vegan burrito, which I think is in my future tomorrow when we have to check out of our hotel. I went for the check in option of the free tequila shot. This place is doing something right for those of us who choose not to eat animal products!",

There was a good portion of meat and seasoning but no veggies to be found. I know it is in the middle of the dessert but if you are shipping in everything else, don't cheap out the veg. Those would make the dishes very fresh. The food was great but lacking the critical element of veggies.  I was a little hesitant that it was located in the walkway between Casinos as it had a mall atmosphere but once inside, it had a really comfy feel with the mariachi band and aromatic dishes.",

Their chicken enchiladas with red sauce are great, and the chicken chimichanga is enormous and delicious!  Just make sure that they are using the correct meat; the DBF does not eat beef or pork, and he ordered a chicken chimi but received a meal with meat that looked a lot like steak.  When we questioned it, we were told the kitchen used thigh meat and not white meat, would we prefer the white?  That just seemed odd since we had not been asked that prior (and I ordered chicken too).  He said yes to the white meat, and in a few moments a new chicken chimi was brought out with shredded white meat just like my enchiladas contained.  Service here is very good and the place is great for groups.  We had a good-sized group of 11 on a recent Saturday night and they were able to seat us in just a few minutes.  They really kept on top of our table too the whole time we were there.    A fun atmosphere with good service, great food and drinks and reasonable prices.  You can't go wrong with Hussong's!",

It was a twist on the classic and I wish I got something else as it was basically a carne asada tostada more than a chili relleno. Sorry we won't be back to Hussongs",

It was taco Tuesday so we each ordered 2 tacos. We really only came so we could eat their amazing chips and salsa. When nothing was brought out, my husband asked and we were told we had to pay for it. We didn't care, we wanted that salsa! An order of chips and 3 salsas arrived. I have no idea what kinds these were but only the regular tomato salsa was somewhat edible and there was no green salsa. I don't know if it was just the day or if they no longer have this. It was truly very disappointing. The service wasn't that great either, but we were used to that in Vegas after this trip. Bring back that salsa and we will be there daily on our next trip.",

I was excited to come here, I am always up for some good Mexican food, but being Mexican myself and from right outside Los Angeles  which has some of the best Mexican restaurants, I guess I am just spoiled with good Mexican food. The queso and bean dip here was too sweet. My son who eats anything with beans barely touched it. I got the sopes. The sope itself was made very good (they are only the size of a silver dollar), but that was it. The steak had gristle, it was mostly shredded lettuce and not a whole lot of beans, meat or cheese. My son got a bean and cheese steak burrito and didn't eat even a quarter of it due to unchewable meat. Husband had the combo taco, enchilada and taquitio. I took a taquitio and there was hardly any meat at all in it. Plus no quacamole or sour cream even for the taquito. I was left very disappointed by all of their food and wished I had gone somewhere else for dinner.",

Hussong's Vegas = Bad ameri-mex food that was mostly over-cooked, over-salty, overly dried out from sitting under heat lights, all of which left both of us overwhelming in need of gas pills for last 2 days in Vegas. Red salsa = canned ketchup w onions. Green salsa = ??? mystery salty green goo, rice and beans were dried out and way salty. Ceviche had all of two shrimps in it. Trademark Hussong's tacos were just OK. Chimichanga was awful - dried out, leftovers with a horrendous red slick of an attempt at mole sauce (?). I'm not sure how, but the chips and salsa tasted jarred, bagged - Costco's are even better.  1 STAR for super fast, friendly service...and 4 STAR 48 HOUR gastro distress. No kidding.  We also came with a travel zoo deal, which took forever to figure out they didn't own the required scanner for the coupon code to get it in the system, so were asked for our travelzoo username and password, so the manger could email himself the voucher...and wait it to show up and be processed...before we could order. Also - travelzoo folks get a mandatory 18% tip slyly slipped onto the bill - which they don't tell you about. The waiter deserved it, so it was actually OK...but I LIKE TO ADD THE TIP MYSELF, AT MY DISCRETION.  This is a great palace for cocktails...in volume. I wish I would have skipped over this travelzoo offer. This Hussong's is NOTHING like the one in Mexico...only the logo is the same.",

Both were thin versions of salsa, which is fine with me, but some flavor or even heat would be appreciated. For starters, I had the queso fundido, which was pretty good and came with soft corn tortillas to eat it with.  Then I had the steak tacos. These were completely flavorless, and improved to decent with the addition of a few good shakes of bottled hot sauce.  The margaritas were actually pretty good, but they were insanely expensive, and I'm not one to complain about cost, especially on vacation.",

After our drink order that he forgot multiple times, he brought the drinks to the table, and  I was with 3 women, and a child. The waiter brought the drinks and as he placed them on the table he stated loudly \"oh I fucked that up.\" He also said a drink was \"on the house\" then charged us for it. I asked for guacamole and sour cream, he informed me it would be \"like a dollar a piece.\" When the bill came 2 dollars for guacamole and a dollar for sour cream. We talked to the manager and he was nice , and removed the items... and the waiter was so rude he asked for a tip at the end of the night. He was a total jerk and needs to find another job like work at home, he doesn't do well working with the public. He scooped up the check as we were walking out and stated \"What No Tip!\" \"Nice!\" And then asked the child we were with for 11 cents to finish the bill. And then followed us out of the restaurant trying to pick a fight. Hope you don't have this experience. I will NEVER go back to that place.",

Food items that I like: can never go wrong with a chimichanga when you've been drinking all day, huevos rancheros, and their pozole soup Never again: skip the flautas and their quesadilla (seriously, who screws up a quesadilla?)  Servers have always been polite, but after your food is delivered, you might not see them again lol. The last couple visits we had to track down someone for more water, additional drinks, and even getting our check took a long time.   Warning: if you're hungover, you might not want to come here. It gets so loud and the mariachi band won't help with the hangover headache. Trust me, my friend wanted to kill me after taking her here when she was hungover and couldn't handle the loud noise.",

Our waitress was super friendly, easy going and more than competent. We ended up getting a bucket of beer (5 for $20) for happy hour.  We split an order of taquitos, which were very good, for my free yelp check in corn and then did a burrito and chimichanga respectively.  The food was good except I was not a huge fan of the sauces.  Not phenomenal, but I'd go again.  Prices were reasonable for Vegas and the restaurant had a fun vibe to it.",

The portions size, three enchiladas, along with rice and beans makes the price very reasonable. The other dish ordered was a burrito and it was gone so i am guessing my son liked it. Chips and salsa?

The manager I think is the one who greeted and seated us...Very nice guy, even came by and checked on our table several times. Our waitress Danielle was just awesome. She was so sweet and was very attentive. The food was so fresh and you could really tell it was fresh. They literally have the best margaritas I've had in my life! The Red Raspberry was my favorite but we got premium flights and they were all fantastic and strong! We will definitely be back! They even gave me a light up shot up souvenir glass for my birthday!",

Ribeye Taco Plate - My brother got this for the $4 upcharge for ribeye. He said the meat was good, but they didn't even grill or heat up the tortilla. It was like straight out of the package.  Barbacoa Nachos - Barbacoa was like mush. It wasn't very good as there was some spicy sauce on it that made my mouth tingle every time I took a bite. Tacos had that spicy sauce too.   The hostess were friendly and playful. My change was $5.xx and she just handed me a $5. She hesitated like to see my reaction or maybe was hoping I would give her the $5?...maybe. Wasn't a big deal to me, but some people frown on that.",

The fact that it tasted like tequila in a glass... wait... no, it was exactly that. One sip and you were already drunk. Maybe that's why they received the vote of having the best margs in town. Aside from the drinks, we were placed in the corner where the wait staff kept hitting the back of my chair and ignoring us. Our server seemed to want nothing to do with us and when having to wave her down to place our order-we couldn't help but feel like we were inconveniencing her. My family has been coming to this restaurant every year for our Vegas vacation and not once has this happened in the past. The food once being so authentic and flavorful has now washed down to tasting like cheap flavorless garbage. Don't let the presentation of the food deceive you. Plastic foods look just as good to eat...but that doesn't mean we should eat them.",

I have to say that the only reason this place got 3 stars was for the excellent service we got from Amber at the bar. She was on top of the drinks, snappy banter and baseball so I was very happy!  WHEN YOU GO- I was not impressed by even their chips and salsa. The chips in our nachos were 10X better so I feel like the table chips sit around for awhile. We also had the mixed enchiladas and steak fajitas and both were pretty dang flavorless. Drinks and nachos are the only thing I'd order here again.

AGH!! My daughter had barbacoa tacos. The shells were so thick! and the meat was mush that if they had given me a paper napkin I would have spit it out when I tried it. My granddaughters grilled cheese was a very THICK piece of bread with what appeared to be mozzarella cheese, absolutely tasteless! The chips and salsa!! OMG..chips are fresh but what they call salsa is a disgrace to the word salsa! The one that looked like fire roasted tomatoes was so sweet that my son in laws diabetes was in heaven (thank goodness he had his insulin!) and the other was so tasteless..no onions jalapenos or cilantro in either sauce. The only nice thing I could say about what is served is the French fries were ok. The recommended pepino margarita (cucumber jalapeno with Tajin on the rim) and the servers are awesome.

This isn't a super nice and trendy spot but for good Mexican food and a good drink at a reasonable price, it's pretty good.   My favorite part was their mariachi band they had walking around. Not your typical mariachi band as they actually interact, talk and joke around with you. They even play non typical mariachi band songs. Definitely entertaining for a spot like this. Only negative about it is they may overstay their welcome focusing on your table until you give them a little tip.   I would still go back. If you don't have food plans then is well worth your consideration.",

We came here on a Friday night when the mariachi band was playing; they were all so nice and friendly and really worked the crowd while performing.   The drinks are well priced and very strong; you definitely get what you pay for in this area! They bring you complimentary chips and 2 types of salsas, both which were VERY good!   I ordered fajitas as a main entree and was very happy with my choice! It was large enough for my husband and I to split, they tasted great and they came out fresh! I will definitely be back here the next time I'm in Vegas!",

They also bring you chips and salsa when you sit down and their salsas are so so so good.

All I gotta say is the food is fantastic and reminds me of home still growing up east LA/Montebello area allowed for me to eat a lot of authentic Mexican food and being the lone Chinese guy amongst Mexicans I've learedn the finer things of Mexican food....and it's not taco b@ll. Any way enough with me. The food is still just as great as the first time here a few months back. I was so impressed initially with a taste of the vegan quesadilla that my wife ordered that I got one this time and she ordered the vegan burrito. All I gotta say is the flavors are very authentic and if you didn't tell me the meat in the quesadilla wasn't meat and the cheese wasn't dairy I wouldn't have really known any different. We brought our Mexican friends this time while visiting and they totally enjoyed themselves. We checked in and got our free comp drinks and got the party started. Thanks again To the crew, we were very well taken care of....food was fantastico!",

They don't just have one or two items to choose from, they have an ENTIRE Vegan menu! It was so exciting! :D   We tried their guacamole, vegan fish tacos, and vegan beef tacos and everything was good!! The guacamole was SUPER fresh! It was really chunky, so you could tell they had just carved the avocado.  I'm glad we got the guacamole because they don't put any on your tacos, so it was awesome to slap some on our grub.  I didn't try my boyfriend's tacos but my vegan fish tasted pretty darn similar to codfish so I was happy.  We were both pretty full at the end of our meal so I didn't get to try their famous vegan chocolate cake (which I'm super sad about!) but we were so pleased with our visit that we've made it a goal to stop by again the next time we're in town. :)    If you're vegan and you love Mexican food, I would give this place a try! It's similar to Baja Mexican fare.",

I read I needed to try the grilled corn, and I'm so glad I did. It was delicious! The margaritas are amazing. Sadly, I visited margaritaville coming back through Vegas and that was a HUGE mistake.

It was pretty loud which I think originally affected our order.  The Food:  Because we were in for a quick bite, we chose to split the Steak Barbacoa Burrito and get the grilled corn offered if you \"check in\". The salsa variety was very good, very fresh.  One is a typical restaurant style with tomato, jalapeno, onion and cilantro.  The other two were a roasted type one being a sweet chipotle and the other had either small chunks of Mango or Pineapple.  All very delicious.  The chips were fresh but a little too think for my liking but still good.  We got the burrito California style meaning it has French fries and guacamole in it.  So glad we did, the meat in the burrito was sweet and smoky, the sauces on top were an enchilada, a verde and a queso.  I got the guacamole on the side and it was so fresh with little chunks and a lot of lime which I am a fan of.  The roasted corn was amazing, we split that too and could have had more, just the perfect amount of spices and cojito cheese.  Service:  Really good service.  Our server was Gerardo and he was very friendly and quick.  I noticed everyone working as a team and really putting customers first.  The only hiccup was when we ordered our burrito we asked for all three sauces and I really don't think he heard us because of the noisy atmosphere but it was very quickly rectified with an apology. Food came out in a timely manner.  Check before gratuity was $23.65 for the rather Large Steak Barbacoa Burrito, grilled corn and a soda.  Plus include the unlimited chips and salsa, we only had one serving and were very satisfied with splitting the meal. Not bad, we had a wonderful experience!  There is one in Boca Park Summerlin and we already have plans to take the whole family! Keep Yelpin Y'All!",

If you are in the area and craving Mexican food do yourself a favor and give this place a try. The food was so good we all had to share, chimichangas and enchiladas and quesadillas were all fantastic.  Authentic and delicious with some modern flares and unique sauces.  Great salsa and perfect fresh made chips still warm when they arrive... Not to mention the $15 2 liter draft and you get to keep the monster glass.",

Here it goes, go to Taco Bell instead of this place. The Mexican food was no where near authentic. The rice was bland and hard. Nothing was tasty! I swear Taco Bell has better quality on their food than this place! No joke!   The waiter was not the most gracious and made a face when we wanted to use their groupons. This was a bad experience. It almost ruined my cousins bachelorette party. We only came here because we were super hungry. They took forever with our checks even after the whole ordeal of the Groupon. Please if you want to save time and an unpleasant experience, don't come here.   My sister said she like the enchiladas but at that point because of the bad service and hardship with the Groupon. I literally couldn't see how good the enchiladas were.   Good luck if you come here!",

We were seated right away and the shortly our waitress brought us complimentary chips and salsa...nice!  Ordered a margarita which was good, but considering that they say they are the home of the original margarita I kind of expected a better margarita!  Not a deal breaker though.  For lunch hubby and myself both ordered chicken enchiladas that came with rice and beans.  I must say that the enchiladas were pretty tasty.  However, the rice and beans could have very well been left off my plate....me no likey!  Service was subpar.  Our waitress seemed very overwhelmed and pushy.  Overall, I would consider returning but it wouldn't be my first or even second when it comes to Mexican food!",

Unfortunately due to last night's experience, I'm pretty sure that will be my last visit. Upon being seated, I asked if we could order the green salsa. Apparently they don't carry that type anymore, which I was very disappointed to hear. We were not allowed to order 1 taco, but were allowed to add a taco to a taco plate...which makes no sense. Here's the kicker: that one extra taco made my $14 taco plate a $25 taco plate!! Is that not absurd? And to top off the experience, they no longer carry steak tacos, even though their menu says otherwise. Their \"steak\" tacos, which have previously been carne asada, are now shredded beef tacos...big difference. We also asked for just a little bit more cheese for our tacos, \"sure we will give you more cheese and not tell you it will be an additional $1.25 to your bill!\" I wish we were told prior to ordering the meal that their \"steak\"is no longer steak and about the differences their menu contains. Sure, tourists visit the restaurant, but what about us locals? All in all, a very dishonest and upsetting visit. Very, very disappointed that my favorite restaurant is no longer Hussong's Cantina.",

The atmosphere is pretty cool. They had a live band playing Spanish music that night. Not too loud, as others have stated. It's not a rowdy get your ass kicked kinda place.

    "text": "On a recommendation from the concierge at the Luxor, Mary Jane, we had dinner last night at Hussongs.  I didn't hold out much hope for finding authentic Mex on the strip in Vegas but I was pleasantly and happily surprised.    Luckily she'd made us a reservation (5 of us locals) and we were seated immediately.  The place is long and narrow and they have squeezed as many tables as possible into the small space.  For those who are familiar with Mandalay Place, it's in the former Chocolate Swan space.    Anyway, we had standard chips and 2 kinds of salsa.. nothing memorable except the chips appeared to be hand made as opposed to processed and bagged.    Service was fast, we had our hand shaken margaritas within minutes of ordering and it was extremely crowded due to MAGIC & the Vet Convention.  Margarita was large & delicious.   Our appetizers were the:  guacamole, thick and chunky with just a slight bite of spiciness and def. delicious; the queso fundido which was thick with cheesy goodness; and the house specialty, Elote Plazero, an ear of corn on the cob, roasted with a thin coat of mayo/butter and cheese.  I could have had a 1/2 dozen of those and called it a day.   Only 2 of us opted for an entree, both having the Enchiladas Suiza. It was beautifully prepared, presented and gobbled down!! This cantina is not for those who are expecting mid-America \"mex\" -- it is as authentic as it gets north of the border.   ...and if it is any indication, I am going back there today for lunch because I don't think I fully experienced all that mexi-goodness last night and must have another go of it.  EDIT: 9/1/2010...  We went back last night after not going for 6 months.  Service was terrible. Not just for us..but all the surrounding tables.  I knocked it back to 3 stars for that.  The food, while decent, can be found at places who can appreciate our hard earned dollars.",

Will do things short for readers:  Waitress was amazing getting a table for us almost immediately, in the meantime Mariachi was singing great authentic Mexican Songs. Table ready, chips came in a SNAP along with a couple of salsas that I define as grandma's!..............I love spicy salsas and food, so I asked for a hotter salsa to dip my chips, but I believe I overestimated the chef. Habanero salsa must be treated with an Ice Cold Negra Modelo and a slice of lime. Food was as good as it gets, second to none!!  I had a combo, so I could taste 3 different dishes all at once. I had # 1: carnitas quesadilla, chile relleno and enchilada. The way they teat pork is amazing, very tasteful meat melted with the cheese and wrapped in a carefully flour tortillita! Chile relleno was great. Mid size Poblano filled and battered at its best. I critique cooks that don't do it the way my grandma does (the batter), but Hussongs' cooks must have traveled to her to learn;   batter was very fluffy, simply cooked to perfection.   Try their \"El Pepino\" drink if you are up for a spicy and fresh tequila drink.  I'll be back and most likely bring locals to try this restaurant. It is DEFINITELY                N O T   your regular casino, mass produced, flavorless restaurant, you will tell, I promise.  Again, believe me, I don't go to the Strip EVER! , but I'll come back here regardless.",

All in all a good mid day pit stop to keep going in Vegas.  We also ordered the tortilla soup which was mediocre.  I'd go there again for the nachos.",

The food is very Americanized and not authentic at all. The portions are super small for the price. Come on, $17 for 4 little tacos?!?!? I've had better tacos at Del Taco. I came here for a friends birthday, but I will never ever come here again. And for some reason, the cashier messed up and ended up charging $283 on my card when our bill was only $40. STAY AWAY!!!!!!",

    "text": "Came here for dinner with a bachelor party. The bachelor got a double shot of tequila on the house so keep that in mind!  I ordered the carnitas tacos. The carnitas meat itself had a good shredded texture with solid flavor. The tortilla itself was rather bland and tore very easily so I had to eat half of the tacos with a fork. No biggie, but eating tacos with a fork is kinda weird. Other than that, the tacos were made with a pineapple salsa that had a good sweet tartness from the pineapple balanced against the heat of the peppers. This is what gave the tacos its signature taste and it tasted okaaaay. Nothing mind-blowingly spectacular but it's definitely different and it works!  Some of my other friends got quesadillas which actually looked and smelled fantastic. And then other other friends got the baja sandwich which is like a torta. That looked quite delicious too and it was huge! They were only able to finish half and had to take the rest home to save for later!  Warning: This place serves you infinite chips with a red sauce and a yellow sauce. Super addictive. We must've went through 10 baskets of these chips and by the time our food was finally served, we were all too full!!  Overall, it was a decent experience. Not the greatest Mexican food I've had, but it's far from the worse. There are certainly better options available to you in Mandalay Bay, however, and the city of Las Vegas has a great culinary scene that Hussong's plays a very small, limited role in.",

We sat at the bar and ordered a Cadillac Margarita and a Jalapeno Margarita right away and they were phenomenal. Soon after we ordered the chips and guacamole (extra spicy) that came with mango habanero salsa and a sweeter salsa YUM! After a few more margaritas and being serenaded by a live mariachi band we ordered some food. I had the chicken enchiladas and he had the steak fajitas and after we got fried ice cream. The manager I think his name was Chad?? Came over and asked us how are dinner was and chatted for a bit. He was one of the nicest managers i have encountered at a restaurant  and really cared about us having a good time. Hussong's Cantina is a very good authentic Mexican restaurant with top notch customer service. We will definitely be returning!",

It should fill up most people, especially after snacking on chips and salsa. I would have liked the steak to have better flavor. It certainly could have benefitted from some seasoning. The chipotle aioli inside does make up for the bland flavor of the meat. None the less, the meat should stand on its own if needed.  Our server was ok.

I'm still inside debating wether to complain or not before I leave. 1 person had a good meal, that's what the 2 stars are for. Don't go here!!",

Great choice!  It was delicious!  My husband loved it too! It was pretty large, so after filling up on chips and salsa, he gladly finished the other half of the chimichanga I couldn't eat.  The salsa they brought out with the chips was deceivingly delicious. It looked almost like ketchup. Smooth, not the chunky tomato salsa I'm used to. But the flavor was amazing. I loved it. I could've eaten it by itself with a spoon.  I'm going to have to remember this place the next time I am in Vegas!",

Here are the highlights and lowlights:  - Their chips and salsas are great.  Their guacamole is delicious. - Happy hour tacos...TINY.  Literally, they are 2 bite tacos.  Totally not worth the $2-3 for each. - Margaritas...too sweet.  They only serve original margaritas.  I asked the waitress if they make strawberry margaritas, and she snootily replied 'we don't have blenders.'  OK then. - The service was subpar.  Our waitress had some attitude and was obviously annoyed that we were sitting and talking after we were done ordering and they had cleared our table.",

    "text": "So I came here recently for lunch for a work meeting. I chose the carne asada which had guacamole, rice, beans and a baked potato. The meat was ok, a little tough and a bit over-seasoned (as were the sides) for my taste. For dessert we shaa plate of churros that had a side of ice cream that tastedlike caramel or leche quemada. They were so good we ordered another plate!   The chips are kept heated in a popcorn/carnitas cart, and they are super delish! Super fatty and salty, I could've eaten my weight in tortilla chips!  Sadly, I dodn't order a margarita since I was working, but I am sure they would be pretty good. Random fact, the margarita is one of the most popular cocktails in the U.S.",

    "text": "Very disappointed with the quality of food that I received when I dined in.  I was excited to see they had vegan options, and had a tough decision on whether to eat here, or slice of vegas one day. I chose wrong, but then later atoned for that mistake.  The chips and salsa, as well as the service, were both excellent, so the two stars reflects upon the rest of the dining experience, because both of those were 5 stars.  My vegan burrito was tasteless, very little in terms of redeeming factors. The sauce that came on it was very bad, it tasted like it was cooked for like 3 hours too long accidentally, burnt, but not in a smoky good way. There wasn't much in terms of crisp veggie content in the burrito itself, mostly some very bland tasting gardein strips. The rice and beans that came with weren't very exciting either.  I think the tell tale sign, was my girl, who usually digs this type of cuisine (its her favorite) didn't like her meal at all (non-vegan meal).  One of the 2 strike outs during our trip, but slice of vegas just down the way was delicious.",

    "text": "We stopped in to Hussong's for a quick bite to eat before heading over to New York New York to see Zumanity. We were seated quickly, and had chips, salsa (two kinds, a red and a green), and water brought to our table right away, which was nice.  The food, honestly, was alright, but the lobster tacos were what really drew us in, and they were a disappointment. The shells were deep fried, which really overpowered any flavor of lobster...or anything else in the taco. I ended up scraping everything out of the shell, and that was marginally better, but still. Sad. The steak quesadilla, on the other hand, was really good - it was served \"open face\" instead of folded over like a normal quesadilla, so it looked more like a pizza, but hey, whatever. It was tasty. I liked that the sour cream was drizzled over the quesadilla instead of served on the side, and even though the quesadilla apparently no longer comes with guacamole, our server brought me a side order of guac anyway with no additional charge.  The salsas were interesting - the texture of the red one reminded me of marinara sauce, but it was actually really tasty and slightly spicy. I tried the green salsa, which was the one my husband preferred, but it didn't have the same heat as the red, so I ignored it after the first couple of bites.  Our drinks (a Mexican mojito and a Mango Margarita) were really good - a little bit pricey, but overall tasty and a decent deal for Vegas. Service was fast, if not overly friendly, and the Mariachi band was cool. They played everything from Pink Floyd to the traditional Mariachi music, and we enjoyed listening to them. We also enjoyed looking at all of the decor around the restaurant, as there was a LOT to look at. I'm regretting we didn't get a photo with the cardboard cutout Dos Equis guy!  Overall, I probably wouldn't be back in, as there are PLENTY of places in Vegas to eat, but it was still an alright meal.",

Food was cheap and the only annoying thing was our pushy up-seller server.  NO I don't want to hear the whole story of inventing the margarita, NO I don't want a $20 souvenir glass of beer, but she just kept trying.  Not a deal breaker though.

But paired up with the name \"Cantina\" threw me off as it's actually an Americanized-Mexican resto within the Mandalay Bay Shoppes.   PERKS + great service (attentive staff dressed in sports jerseys) + gigantic drinks - they have specialties such as the \"Bull Dog\" (margarita + beer), but I opted for a sangria + FISH TACOS ($14) two mahi mahi fish tacos were fried placed upon two corn tortillas with shredded lettuce, guacamole and pico de gallo. Very fresh and decent dish. (Note: apparently the most popular item on their menu) + CHIPS & SALSA & GUACAMOLE - salsas were fresh! Chips were crisp and the guac was devoured by everyone!  DIRTS - prices: although the fish tacos were a decent meal, I thought the dish was WAY over-priced for Americanized-Mexican food (but alas, it's Vegas so they'll charge a bit more) - noisy: my co-workers and I had a little get together here, although it was nice they were able to reserve a section for us. The whole resto is a bit noisy with the sports games going on and the chatter from all the customers - not authentic - mediocre drunk grub  FYI *located in mini-strip mall walk-way in between Mandalay Bay & Luxor *you can keep the gigantic glass of margarita once you've drank it all *laundry list of margaritas are available  *drinks range from $8-14 *many flat screen televisions to watch the latest sports game  *Rick Moonen's \"RM\" restaurant is just around the corner for sustainable seafood  I came here with my co-workers for a little get together after a meeting. I'm not sure if I'd eat at this establishment again. But for great service, good drinks and mediocre food, it's okay, but probably not my first choice.",
