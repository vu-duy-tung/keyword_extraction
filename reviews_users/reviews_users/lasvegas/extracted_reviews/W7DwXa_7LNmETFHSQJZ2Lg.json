Two days ago my father went to pick up some rolls and sushi and the staff was very rude to him ( he had a stroke few years ago his speech is not perfect) they were very rude. The food on the other hand went from 9 - 3 real quick after the management changed.  Not fresh tasted bad ... the rolls were so bad it was like vending machine food. You can get better sushi n rolls from Smiths. such a let down.",

There are only a few incredible things I find here these days (under the \"new\" owner and staff,) but there is still a lot they are doing right here.  As I see it, there are two reasons to come here: Uni & AYCE.  They don't serve any disappointments here.  Just about everything is a little above average, so with AYCE you get a lot of good food at a solid price $26/$27 I think.  But outside of the Uni there is nothing here worth calling out specifically in my book.  One of the better spots in the immediate area, but not a place I go out of my to get to.",

The menu didn't stated anything about kids charge and the waitress even dare to question why do I get upset after hearing that.  What the hell, I can't even express myself in this damn restaurant and they will charge your toddle for sharing.

Too much rice for a small piece of fish.  Also very thinly sliced. Teriyaki chicken was precooked with sauce poured over. Pretty dry.  Could be different chef.  Price is reasonable. Will try again because maybe caught a bad day. Servers always good and pleasant.  If your consider price probably 4 stars.",

Tricked my cousin into eating a piece of the 911 with me, the chefs gave him some cream cheese on the house to cool his mouth...and jokingly asked if he'd like the habanero sauce with it    I would urge to order the uni, however when I dined with my s/o i believe I came across a bad batch. We ate the exact same items, save for the uni and I ended up becoming ill and blowing chunks once we arrived home   Other than that experience I love the place and would come again for sure!

THAT'S what matters to me!!  Well, as you might have guessed seeing the 5 star review, it's better than good in my book.  It was surprisingly good actually!  I ordered about 15 different kinds of Nigiri.  Not ONE of them were disappointing!  All tasted fresh, but here are some noteworthy ones to touch on :  Uni : Very good Uni! Love the consistency...not watery/runny or overly salty!  I am SUPER particular when it comes to uni...it's the difference between thoroughly enjoying it, or slightly gagging on it at first taste.  Thankfully, it's the former.  Hotate : The Fresh Scallops were PERFECT! Super tender, melt in your mouth good! Buttery, with just a hint of citrus and wasabi of course...only thing I have found to rival it ANYWHERE is YG&S's LIVE counterpart!  And considering that it's not FAIR to compare it, this is the best I've found LOL :P  Amaebi : The sweet shrimp had a slight crunch to it, buttery taste, and smooth finish.  Great choice.  I did not receive the fried heads...you probably need to specify if you want them.  The Hamachi Kama was on the daily special...this is my most favorite part of the fish!  If you see it on the menu and don't mind diggin in for the good stuff, you gotta try the collar if you have been sleeping under a rock!  If you've had it before, you are gonna order it without reading this anyways LOL.  And for dessert, both the Chocolate Mousse and Green Tea Creme Brulee were on daily special.  If you see either on the menu, I would highly recommend both!  Chocolate mousse is a little thicker than their sister stores counterpart, but still that same great taste.  The creme brulee was perfect...strong green tea taste, and I love that crispy crust!  Service was very fast.  They were pretty slow on this Tuesday night, which got me worried about the quality I was to encounter, but I am glad it didn't affect my visit.  But because it was slow, my orders got taken promptly, food was prepared and served quickly, and I always had refills etc.  Only NEGATIVE thing I can think of...I got charged $3 for \"sharing\" with Little Foodie Dude.  He just turned two, and yes, he DOES have an appetite LOL, but it will mark forever in history as his first charge at an AYCE restaurant.  I'm not too mad though, considering he ate an entire order of Edamame, 4 pieces of unagi, ahi, salmon skin handroll etc lol.  He got his $3 worth :P  I hope it wasn't a fluke, but I much preferred my visit today than the last few times I have been to the Henderson location, as well as the G'monster himself!  All they need now is the Grilled Pork Belly and I'll never have to go back there again lol.  Keep it up Sushi-Mon...keep the ball rollin forward and never look back!  Pics :",

Frankly, it feels lazy and beneath Sushi Mon. As for recommendations, I always order a bunch of Cajun albacore, and the a chi chi (sp?) roll with the sauces on the side. I love spicy food, but my friend does not, so we can eat this roll to our liking! Recently, a waitress offered us the chance to try their fresh wasabi (Wow! What a difference! Definitely try it! So fresh and spicy!) I really hope the new owners switch back to fountain soda, but overall, this place is excellent!",

Not only do you get sushi rolls you also get hot food options like teriyaki chicken to shrimp tempura to steamed or fried gyoza.  There are cold salad options too.  The main \"rule\" here is that if you order it you better finish it as you will be charged additional for unfinished rolls.  They have a great half roll option so there should be no issues finishing what you order.    The service is great and you don't wait long once you start ordering.  We placed our order and within 5 minutes our awesome sushi started rolling out.  The waitress was pleasant and didn't look at us like we were big ol pigs for ordering so much.  The gyoza was fresh with a great filling that included cabbage.  The teriyaki chicken wasn't the best, it's all up to how you like it prepared.  The sushi was on point and there were a ton of sushi rolls to choose from.  The JJ roll and the 007 roll were great and try the royal California roll too.  The supreme Alaska was full of tasty salmon.  Ohhhhh the spicy tuna is the perfect amount of spicy and the Cajun albacore nigiri is great!  Damn me!  I'm hungry for sushi again!!!   Parking was easy and there is quite a bit of it.  This restaurant is just below Durango on Sahara.  It's in between Cimmaron and  Durango on the north side of the road.  It's in the same parking lot and just a few stores away from Nothing Bundt Cakes.  Paymons is in the same parking lot too.  We walked out beyond full ready to pop from this awesome meal!",

Once we received the rainbow roll, (I could see the color was not what I though it could be.) my friend had a bite and didn't say much, I had a bite and the fish was awful. I looked at my friend and he is slowly spitting his bite into a napkin.  We asked the server if she could take it back and asked for our bill.  The server then brought the manager to our table and the manager advised me, \"if I eat one more piece, she won't charge me for the roll\"  I declined her offer and we asked for the bill again.  The bill came and she charged us for our all you can eat, and an additional charge for the rainbow roll.   All together, the woman handled the situation poorly.  I didn't eat the roll because it would make me sick, this is poor quality fish.  The fact that this was a \"manager\" asked me to eat another piece of this god awful fish is asinine.   We received our check with 2 all you can eat (which is expected and we are fine with) and additional charge for that rotting roll of fish.   Save your appetite unless you want to scream out of your anus.",

I'm always ordering tons of Salmon Belly Nigiri with lemon slices. I try to avoid the specialty rolls, I may order a \"half order\" and share. It's perfect if you only want 1 or 2 pieces.",

Unfortunately, this time...she ended up with Scombroid food poisoning (which if you don't feel like looking it up - is specifically caused by ingesting DECAYED fish.  Lovely.  When she (and her husband) attempted to call to speak with a manger to inform them, they're response was to HANG UP ON THEM?  Probably not they're smartest move.  Already submited a complaint to Clark County Health District.    I'm not a sushi eater myself, and can only hope this was an isolated incident, but it's extremely disappointing that any establishment would hang up on a customer, especially when it could end up backfiring on them!",

The chicken yalitori is a thick cut piece of teriyaki on a stick instead of small pieces of juicy chicken. The amount of rice that comes with the nigiri remains small but the quality of the unagi, super white, seared salmon, hamachi, and tamago have declined since my last visit a couple of years ago. Maybe the rolls are still delicious but I only ate nigiri on this visit.   On the bright side, the tempura is as delicious as I remembered.

Although it looked as a full house, we were seated within 5-10 minutes. Immediately we were greeted with our server who asked us for our drinks and took a look at the menus.  We both had AYCE sushi, so this is what we ordered. 2x Garlic Tuna Nigiri Fried Gyoza Fried Calamari Shrimp Tempura Roll  Teriyaki Chicken Orion Roll (8pcs) 1/2 Order Crispy Rice (5 pcs) Steamed Shumai 2x Shrimp Tempura Cajun Albacore Nigiri 1/2 Order Cynthia Roll (5 pcs) 1/2 Order Royal California Roll (5 pcs)  Everything was so good, the service was prompt and all the food came out in good time.

I usually get AYCE and never had any issues.  Now they are like sushi nazi's. Watching the clock to make sure you don't order anything even a minute past your allowed time, trying to charge me for one piece of uneaten sushi from a roll I didn't really care for, I felt the eyes looking at us making sure my girlfriend who didn't get AYCE didn't have any of my order, etc.  they also seemed to disappear after my first round of ordering trying to allow the clock to run down, and limit the amount of sushi I could order in the time frame.  All in all it seems like they are out to save as much money, and pinch all the  pennies as possible (scary with a sushi restaurant). I also had a frequent AYCE card that was filled up and ready to use for a free meal. I had no idea, but it had expired the day before. They refused to accept it!    I won't be going there anymore, and they lost a loyal customer.  They saved a penny, but only to loose a dollar.",

About 1.5 yrs ago, they changed the unagi to a lesser quality and smaller portion. It's been downhill since then. At Sushi Mon recently, we had to send back the snow crab because it was starting to spoil and was inedible. They are serving salmon nigiri that includes sinews from the worst parts of the fish. Gone is the beautiful marbling of fat that should be seen with good quality salmon nigiri. The California role? Though this role blasphemes the very idea of traditional sushi, the one they served us should be a source of major embarrassment to any sushi chef. The uni thankfully was fresh and delicious. I know the quality of AYCE sushi can never match a la carte, but in this case, the AYCE sushi used to be much better. The price hasn't gone down, but now the quality has dipped so far that we've decided to start searching for a new favorite sushi spot, sorry to say.",

It has been a few months since I have last visited, but today it seemed like it was exceptionally flavorful. The staff is also fantastic. They're all super sweet and attentive.  The rolls are always delicious, and well made, especially when they're AYCE which at many places tends to be sloppy. My favorites are their takoyaki, baked green mussels, garlic tuna, super white tuna, red snapper, the Moon Roll, and the Ecstasy Roll. A couple of small things I wish they could improve on are outside seating and a tiny bit more effort on sweeping. With the outside seating, it gets pretty busy some nights, and you can not sit unless your entire party is present. With the sweeping, the restaurant is pretty much always clean, but my boyfriend dropped a piece from his roll today and there was rice everywhere under his seat. We got the attention of one the staff and told them what happened, and if I was a host or server there, my first instinct would be to sweep it up right away.",

    "text": "Sushi Mon has two locations in Vegas. This one here in Sahara, and another in Maryland Pkwy (South Vegas). The South Vegas location is the original. Both locations are one of the best AYCE Sushi joints in Vegas. Lunch AYCE is $21.95 and dinner is $26.95. You don't have to get AYCE and can just order like a normal restaurant. But I think the prices for the All you can eat is quite a good deal if you know what to order. The quality of fish is fresh and I never had a Nigiri or roll I didn't like.  Here's the Nigiri you can order in AYCE (not including the special rolls and appetizers you can also get. Each order is 2 pieces of Nigiri.) My favorites being: 1. Salmon ( A very fresh and clean tasting fish. I highly recommend this to first time sushi eaters as it doesn't have any fishy smell and is very smooth. My all time favorite.) 2. Yellowtail ( Classified as a \"Luxury fish\" Has a rich oily texture. The flesh is light red, A good piece of Yellowtail has very rich flavors. I used to go deep sea fishing for this with my late father. )  3. Halibut ( White meat of the sea, Hirame has a very light taste and is delicate. The meat has a soft and chewy texture and lots of flavor. Another fish I used to go deep sea fishing for. Quite an ugly fish if you ever catch one yourself. But one of my favorites by far. 4.

    "text": "By far, my favorite sushi restaurant here in Las Vegas!  How they manage to serve quality tasting fish in the middle of the desert is beyond me!  I normally tackle the all-you-can-eat menu, which allows me to try everything in small portions (great when trying new items, or just enough before you call it quits!). The nigiri is great, as well as their house specialty rolls, which I suggest ordering later so you don't cork up your appetite so soon. Don't forget to save room for dessert(s) which is also included in AYCE- the tempura ice cream and lychee sorbet are my favorites!  For smaller appetites, the \"screaming orgasm,\" curry and udon are delicious \"regular menu\" options.  The staff is always friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is casual and fun. Being such a popular restaurant, you and your party may not be seated right away, but it's definitely worth the wait!",

Normally the service is excellent, but tonight not even close.  After our 1st serving of the all you can eat deal the waiter asked if we were ready for desert, and ask three more times before we were finished.  We were reminded that our hour was up and we could make one final order.  I have no problem with this, but it was the first time that has happened.  While I was still chewing my food the waiter who had dropped our check on our table kept checking to see if we put our card out to pay, and we said we would pay at the counter and he said they needed the table.  So before I swallowed we just got up and paid.  I am terribly disappointed and most likely will not go back.  It's sad because the food is great and I can deal with bad service, but not straight up rudeness.",

Maybe it's changed in the last 4-5 months, but after the changeover it became very uncomfortable. Large slices of fish became thin. Included items became additional charges. I have a son, 2 years old. As a regular, I think you let people get away with things (I say this as a restaurant owner who let's my regular customers have things all the time). I have to admit, I was annoyed when they charged my son who eats two pieces of a roll and plays with a third piece. I'm not cheap and I don't mind paying for him, but we were good for at least once a week. . . Let it slide.   Then flavors from the kitchen changed too. Take it or leave it. I bought my restaurant as an existing business as well. Your customers liked what they received. You may think you're improving something, but in reality you are changing something that people like. It was good before. Now we're regulars at sushi koma. Very happy, but miss the old crew.",

As they left 2 open seats empty for 15 minutes to wait for another person to join a party at sushi bar as other people were waiting for seats. When I asked employee for a manager, she paused for a few seconds and said that they were not available!!

He was soaked from head to toe and in tears. Now, I know accidents happen but first of all it could have been prevented by not holding a tray over a baby's head. Second, when something like this happens, I would have thought the manager would have come over to make sure my son was ok... Nope all we got was a sorry from the waiter and then he started to clean the water up. So I went back to the restrooms which were both taken at the time, waited there for a minute and just decided to take my son out to the car to change him and calm him down... Once again waiting for the manager to come up to us. So by the time I got to the car I was just livid. All I wanted to do was leave. I knew if I had stayed I would have ripped someone a new one.   On the way home I called the manager and spoke to him. He was no help what so ever and was claiming that the reason he didn't walk up to us was because \"we were in the bathroom\"... Which we weren't... And \"we walked outside\"... Which he still could have came to check on us and make sure my sone was ok. Excuses excuses! One he started to talk over me and would listen to what I was saying, I hung up.   Needless to say I will never come back and neither will my family and friends.",

We love to order nigiri, so I'll try to remember everything:   -tuna -garlic tuna  -tako -salmon  -blue fin toro  -euro sea bass  -poki -ebi  -yellowfin  - 1/2 911 roll - 1/2 a chi chi  - 1/2 sexy girl  - 1/2 crispy rice   I can't go into detail describing every dish since it's all pretty self explanatory and the last 4 specialty rolls I forget what was in them :(  I will tell you this though, the quality of the fish was superb, especially the salmon belly and toro (it melted in your mouth!) but the best part was the quantity of fish!!! Some places they give you a huge chunk of rice with a thin later of fish... Not here, not this time! Thick ass pieces!! Excuse my language, I'm just that excited!!! And our chef, BEN, was super nice, explained every kind of fish, their delivery dates, and even made us some nice nigiri pieces that were not on the menu. This totally made the price well worth it, and the staff weren't awkward when we ordered half their inventory, like we usually do when we order sushi.  We also arrived right after the lunch menu, 4pm, so it was not crowded and noisy, and had all their attention!!   Great place, friendly staff, superb service, and superior quality and quantity of fish. Shout out to Ben once again for the service!!!  Thank god I wore my stretchy pants today!!!",

We totally demolished it - lots of nigiri, spider rolls, specialty rolls, baked salmon skin rolls, shrimp tempura, tuna poke, and more.  They did not add in an auto gratuity and credited us one AYCE meal on our current bill through their stamp program.  This place is small but they churn out the sushi.",

The super white tuna, poke and orgasm salad were all UNO!   The chef was also super cool. He had a smile the entire time. I recommend this spot to anyone looking to try something different. It's not as packed as the location on eastern. Also don't forget to ask for your stamp car for all you avid sushi eaters! If you don't want it you can give it to me haha JK Happy Sushi Eating.

When we sat down, I showed the staff the stamp card and he said he will check with the manager. He came back and said it was okay as long as it has the location on the stamp card. We continued with our meal. When it was time to pay, the lady brought us the bill and I showed her the stamp card and she said they do not accept the stamp card at that location because they are under new management. We had no clue that Sushi Mon on Sahara is no longer part of the Mon Restaurant  Group and it was not posted that they are under new management. We will not be back to this location.",

The hot dishes are very tasty, tempura is fluffy and crispy, salads are fresh.

    "text": "Well, I tried a sampling of 4 different offerings, and a few that my wife ordered: Poke salad with tuna was the tiniest salad I have ever seen. I have been to many sushi places and I have watched good ones come and go. Arata is MUCH better, but is only average. Yama used to be good, but tumbled downhill.  and one piece was very chewy, obviously being a mistake. My wife ordered combo tempura, which was good, except one item was nearly raw potato that I was required to eat. Not a good situation! Next I got a full roll that had way too much eel sauce, and was therefore EXTREMELY SALTY. The next item I ordered was called \"Volcano\", but instead of being torched like you would expect, a pile of gooey, heated slop is thrown on top. Not very pleasant from my point of view. I took a friends advice that this was a good place. I cannot imagine why I would go here again, even if it was free! The food is bland and forgetable. My friend goes there often. He must order something different. All in all,  ate until I was full, and will not return. I tried my wife's Hurricane roll. Also bland. It's fortunate that the ginger and wasabi were okay, so the food had at least a little bit of flavor.",

I've also witnessed how drastically the food quality and service has changed yet we chose to come and eat at this place. Today, came in for AYCE with my husband and kids (5 year old and 16 month old) My son is allergic to seafood so we brought his own food to eat as what we've always done in the past but today we were told that we can no longer bring outside food. Also, they told me that they have charge my 16 month old extra $3.00 because she was eating off of my plate. (One piece of sushi and edamame)  I think it's just ridiculous but really? I thought it was a joke but server was serious. Nevertheless, today will be the last time we are coming here. This place just lost a loyal customer for years!!! By the way, good luck finding unagi on their caterpillar roll since they put so little to none!!!",

Which placed me sitting akwardly in front of the door in everyones way, rather than at the table. Not happy about this already. The sushi was not necessarily bad, although there was nothing fantastic about it either. All you can eat makes sense when you have a large party... When time to leave our checks were wrong and they could not straighten it out, so we just paid and left. I am just not at big fan! Most likely not going to go back.

I went in recently again decided to take my cousin from LA to go have some all you can eat which turned out to be a nightmare the waitress brought us out our 1st order when we where going to order more she looked at my cousins plate and told her she had to eat that and pointed, we did'nt notice anything because we finished everything she came over again and got the plate and pointed at literaly 5 pieces of rice grains and told her again she had to eat that before ordering more well she did so we ordered more and finally it was time for dessert I dont eat sweets but my 6yr old son kept asking for Mango Mochi being that its included in the all you can eat I figured sure no problem as long as it get's eaten well here she comes again heard my son say \"mommy mango mochi\" she looked at me and said \"he cannot eat the ice cream\" I said \"excuse me? it's included in my all you can eat as long as it gets eaten there shouldnt be any problem it's not like I was feeding my kid sushi he had his own order of teryaki.\" she said \"Those are the rules\"  I told her to just bring it to me but she was waiting for me to say he wasnt going to eat it before she brought it I did not say that because the DAMN ICE CREAM was for my son not me. HORRIBLE service I get the all you can eat rules but this lady went overboard which cost her, her tip.",

Peppers they were a buck seventy-five apiece not bad I was done eating my three orders of sushi - 3 small bites and I asked the lady for a to-go cup she told me I'm sorry we don't have to go cups I don't understand how I can pay for a drink and not take it that's not right I paid for all of my stuff alicart and it was not all you can eat there should be no reason why they shouldn't offer to go cup I don't think that is good service at all so I sat there and extra 30 minutes while I drink my drink and that time I stared at the check and realize they forgot to charge me for the drinks mind you I was upset that they didn't have a to-go cup I thought that was rude but I wanted to make sure that they didn't offer the drinks because if that was the case I had no right to complain about not having a to-go cup the lady said to me oh no she forgot to charge you so me being the nice person I am cuz I could have said that's your problem not mine I had her fix the bill to charge me for two drinks but seriously there was maybe four people in that shop and you forget to add the bill correctly I definitely will not be back and I will make sure the people know my opinion when it comes to Sushi Mon I will definitely be returning to Sushi 21 on Flamingo and Decatur it is worth the drive because apparently nothing close to me is halfway decent",

There have been more changes since I was last there. Now there is a new sushi counter. I liked the previous counter better than the new one. The motor for the refrigeration unit seems to give off a lot of heat towards the end of the counter. Not to mention the counter was filthy where I sat down. Not only was the counter top filthy, but there was a bug in my daughters volcano roll. I handed the dish back to the guy behind the sushi bar and he set the plate down on the counter where they were preparing sushi.  I would also like to know why there are no Asian people working there anymore? This is an Asian restaurant, is it not? The other owner had Japanese sushi chefs. Now the new owner just hires anyone to roll up fish and rice. I'm not saying you have to be Japanese to make sushi, but come on man. Where is the authentic vibe that used to be here? It's just like a fast food place now. All they need is a drive through window.  Well, I can say after seven years of frequenting this establishment, I won't be back. I'm not feeling the new Sushi Mon. It use to be my favorite place. What a shame.",

Get a punch card, you will be back.  Consistency is where it's at here.  Also, lunch is cheaper with mostly all the same items.  Order the Cajun albacore and the baked mussels... you will be glad you did.  Lastly, if it's your first time, order half rolls so you can try everything.  Happy sushi eating.",

I had a party of 13 with me and we were all present and there is a sign on the door that says 80% of your party must be present before being seated. There was a section for us to be seated but there was a party of 2 waiting on 3 more, that was hindering us to sit as a family. I asked them to have those 2 to get up and wait but they refused, I asked for a manager but no manager present. Now we were forced to sit at the bar, now I couldn't talk to my cousins on the otherside. It was supposed to be a wonderful family outing which turned horrible as we couldn't catch up with each other and couldn't communicate. At The end of the dinner, they were 3 extra rolls because we all couldn't communicate of who is ordering what and our servers couldn't tell us what was coming. So the server decided to charge us for the extra rolls. I asked them that why you made an exception for them breaking the rules but not us? I've been coming to this place for years and I'm always bringing 10-16 party with me. If not a large party, it's just my family of 3 or 4 and we eat there 2-3 times a month. I'm always in good hands with Ulyiss as be is always making sure our drinks are full and empty plates gets removed. But with this experience, never again and now I'm aware of all these social media review, I'm making sure non of my friends or family gets treated that way. I even had the server agree that I had all my party preset but sat a different party that WAS NOT 80% present.",

We are the couple that must find at least one best Japanese restaurant anywhere we go because hubby was an ex-sensei and I'm a forever sashimi-eater. So here we are. We came to Sushi Mon for dinner with hubby's family (the Vegas residence) before, but this time we came for lunch with his nephew. We had a great lunch. They ordered \"all you can eat\" and I ordered chirashi bowl. So I cannot eat all that I can because \"all you can eat\" cannot be shared but I was happy with my order. Who needs to eat it all? Most sushi place in Vegas have this type of promotion, all you can eat, surprise that everyone seems to be able to follow this \"all you can eat\" trend. The servers are Japanese but the four sushi chefs are mixed, could be Japanese and Chinese but I saw one was teaching the other, one was focusing on filleting, one was on a cell phone (kidding!). Of course no one's on a cell phone here, hello! Anyway, the lunch was great and we would come back here, for sure. Someday I'll try that \"all you can eat\" thing and see whether it's True that I could eat it all! Enjoyed it, thanks! Recommended.",

The server Zack wouldn't let me use the restroom because I technically wasn't a paying customer; even though they won't sit you down unless your party is all there. This is exactly what recently happened to Starbucks. I will never visit this location or any of their sister restaurants. Good job Zack, you are a great example of what's wrong with this nation.",

    "text": "Update: had a pretty awesome AYCE meal here last weekend. Sat in front of the friendly Kazu-san and had a good time. Incredibly tender unagi. Nice salmon belly and yellowtail belly. Very buttery toro. Sushi rice in the nigiri was on the warm side, and loosely packed - and I appreciated that. All of the nigiri was prepared like this. Kazu-san's got skills!  I was also served a perfectly broiled Yellowtail Collar - medium rare. Delicious. The scallop sushi was very firm and fresh - the closest to live I've had in nigiri form. (Sushi Koma's scallop sushi is rather slimy+fishy in comparison.)  My new hand roll rule: Only order hand rolls one-at-a-time at the sushi bar *only* (to maintain a crispy nori cone). Makes all the difference. Your hand roll nori will become a soggy latex funnel if you let it sit for more than 20 seconds. Gobble it up as soon as it is made!  I am again a big fan of the 'new' Sushi Mon. Great service, little or no wait time, and a convenient location for West-siders. I *do* enjoy the kitchen food at Sushi Koma a little more (e.g. their Tostada, their gyoza) but as far as straight-up sushi goes, Sushi Mon is fantastic.",

    "text": "This place has changed so it deserves a new review.  First off, they eliminated fountain drinks in favor of $1.99 (or so) per CAN of soda/iced tea/etc. This move was clearly about the money cause you can get pretty thirsty with all that rice they add onto the sushi (yes, a nice amount of rice with a slightly less proportioned slice of fish).   Then, they replaced my Sushi Mon card with a location limited Sushi Mon card without my permission (meaning if I had most of my stamps from the other Sushi Mon location, say for example, because I live closest there and I frequent that location the most, I can no longer go to that location with my stamp card I'm forced to go to the Sahara location as it says it's limited to that location only).   I've been coming here for over 10 years (that's right), and sadly, I've watched it decline from what it once was when i would first go there. My friend and I were waiting 10 minutes till we received our 5 orders of salmon, while the table who was seated 10 minutes after we were seated got their order of 2 rolls within 10 minutes of being seated. This continued until I complained to the waiter, pointing out how full their table had gotten with food ordered from the sushi bar, in comparison to us who have only been served a small amount of items within a larger span of time. It made me pretty unhappy but after I pointed it out we magically began getting 3-4 other orders to our table within 15 mins , much like the table beside us.   The one thing that their menu has that no other AYCE restaurant has is halibut. The quality of the fish is good, the service is lacking... still.   It's also extremely annoying when you're at the bar and constantly having to remind the chefs what you ordered, it'd be nice if they gave you a paper to fill out cause it can be hard getting their attention.   This was a review and a rant at my bad experience from the other week. But here's my overall summary:  5/10 Customer Service (consistently) 8/10 Quality Of Sushi (some days there have been an \"off\" taste)  They fixed the rotten egg smell, woohoo !",

I should've listened to my gut feeling.   It took them 20 MINUTES to give me my 2 orders for salmon nigiri and a half lemon roll. It wasnt even busy. Even when I've been to multiple sushi places that were much busier than this place, it has NEVER taken 20 minutes for a simple order. Then my server forgot to write down my other order so i had to wait another 10 minutes for another 2 half rolls.   I had to flag her down twice to get the status of both orders. Just absolutely ridiculous. They didnt even try to remedy the issue. She gave my friend a coupon for free ayce but there was \"nothing we can do\" about messing up my orders. Really? Because you're just handing out free sushi coupons. NOT at all worth the money if youre going to wait 20 minutes for 4 pieces of sushi. Urgh. What a waste of my money.",

Their fish quality is far better than the other ayce places around town, and I love how they have different daily specials. They might not have the fanciest nor most creative looking rolls, but they do their nigiri right. They had Kobe beef nigiri the second to the last time I was there, and it was uhh-maaay-jiiing! I also love their tempura and hamachi kama, which are all included in the ayce. I've heard people say they got charged extra with leftover rice, but if you sit at the sushi bar, you can request the sushi chefs to go easy on the rice.   Lunch is $21.95 and dinner is $26.95 (with the dinner price you can order uni and sweet shrimp with a 1 order limit per person). Service is always attentive and accommodating. I have been a fan of Sushi Mon since day one, and I will continue to keep coming.",

The Spider roll was also a top pick and all the other appetizers I tried I really enjoyed. The staff from Chef to wait staff were really good and very attentive to our table. There's no shortage of parking and their restroom was very clean. The grand finale of my lunch was dessert and their Strawberry Monchi ice cream made my day.

The sushi is made fresh to order, and it's all pretty incredible. I tried Uni and raw eel for the first time, and they were both a little different but overall very enjoyable. Their deep-fried rolls were savory and sweet, perfectly crunchy, and somehow still had beautifully raw tuna in the center. The nigiri were simply perfect, where I'm from a lot of the sushi places coat their fish in lemon juice to hide whether or not the fish is fresh, but there was nothing on their fish and it was very good.  I don't generally do desserts when I eat out, but I tried a taste of someone's lychee sorbet and I couldn't help but order some for myself. It was very smooth, and probably the only fruit-flavored frozen dessert that I'd EVER describe as decadent.   The service is VERY quick and friendly, we didn't have to wait between courses.  Overall I would say that I'd love to go here again!",

Not to mention they were not that busy and took me nearly 30 min to get my first roll.  I am very displease with this place now.  I have them two stars cause the wait staff even commented that the sushi chefs are extremely slow and horrible and they didn't charge me for service because they know me as a loyal customer.   I will give them another chance but not for awhile.  Let me add that if they don't make a serious change it will sadly be the last.

    "text": "Since I was doing some business on Sahara and my son wanted ayce sushi, we decided to give Sushi Mon a try since it was just a couple of driveways over.  My family and I were promptly seated.  The first thing that I noticed was how very small and limited their appetizer selection was.  We ordered sushi at the same time as our appetizers.  Some appetizers came out fairly quick, while others came much later.  Very small portions.  They also claimed to have been short on eel, so it was 1 order per person.  Never have I experienced that one before.  The 1st nigiri sushi we had ordered came out like 10 min after we placed our order, with the rest of our order nigiri coming out 1 plate at a time at about 10 min intervals.  Like others have said about horrible wait times, we waited 45 min for our 1st roll to arrive.  I don't understand what the problem was because 2 sushi chefs were working and their were only like 2 other tables occupied.  There must have been a shift change because a new sushi chef (asian man with glasses) kept staring at our table.  Finally a Korean lady asked if our waiter explained the time limt rules when we 1st arrived.  How are you going to enforce the time limit when it takes 45 min for the 1st roll to come out and it takes even longer for all the food you ordered 1 hour ago to arrive?  We frequent BF Sushi, being that we live on that side of town.  Large appetizer menu, great service, fast, courteous and never a time limit.  This place also loads you up on rice, whereas BF Sushi put like 1/4 the rice on their nigiri as this place.  One thing is for sure:  I will never come back and I will surely never recommend this place to anyone.  Save your money and go elsewhere.",

    "text": "I decided to try this restaurant instead of my usual sushi place. The food was good and the prices seemed fair from the online menu, but I was not satisfied at all. I called in and ordered it for take out (my boyfriend and I wanted a nice night in for Valentine's Day). When I got there to pick it up, the staff was completely rude and said they had no record of my order so it was never even placed! They said it would be ready in 15 minutes. Fine. After FORTY-FIVE minutes went by, my order was finally \"ready\", but they forgot one of my rolls, and I had to wait even longer for it to be actually done! Then I got home. I was so disappointed! The rolls are so tiny that it reminded me of how gas station sushi looks - the entire roll could fit in my hand, not exaggerating! The couple extra bucks I would pay at my usual place doesn't seem so bad now. I definitely will not be a customer here again.",

Personally I rather eat this than a Vegas buffet. It's a small humble location in a plaza. The wait staff were super friendly and quick with their service. They do not skimp on anything. I would probably place this in my top 5 sushi spots.  The nigiri is super duper fresh! How do they even get fresh fish all the way out to Vegas!? The price is very typical but you really get your worth in quality. Dessert, drinks all included. I can't really say anything more.",

Their tuna was kind of weird texture but other then that food was good.  I liked their masago roll, moon rool, and garlic edemame. The reason I give them 2 stars is because the manager charged me for literary not eating a HALF OF A SPOON of RICE I almost wanted to laugh it wasn't even a whole one peice of sushi. He wasn't nice at all about it.  I probably wont be going back to that location just because of him.",

The hostess or owner who was seating people made me so angry. Although we got there earlier than half of the people waiting, she refused to seat us. When I checked the waiting list, our names were on the top yet we weren't seated because the team of 7 who came after us. When ever there were empty seats in the bar, she didn't even ask us if we wished to take those seats. After three tables left and were empty, we still couldn't take those seats because the entire party of 7 weren't there. She continually waited for those people when their seating policy clearly states that the party won't be seated until the entire party is present. This experience was so disappointing and outrageous. Although sushi mon has great food, I won't be returning if this treatment continues.",

Since new management took over, there no longer is Uni (which I actually don't like but feel like it added some value to the AYCE), Toro, Sake Shooters or unlimited sake Mon-Thu. I am not sure if it has actually gone up in price but it feels like it has and the value isn't as good as it used to be.   The fish here is still pretty solid, there is a crispy rice and tuna roll that is probably the best thing we had there. Also the chefs don't seem to be as heavy handed with the yuzu which was one of my main complaints in the past. The one thing I didn't like was the Ahi Poke bowl. It used to be a nice starter of just fresh pieces, now it has a lot of other things in the bowl which I did not appreciate. Still a place that is probably worth the AYCE price, and the food is good but it used to be better so I think I am comparing it to that",

    "text": "Considering this is location is now a member of the Mon Restaurant Group, I guess it would be easiest to compare this place to Goyemon.  Not as many choices as Goyemon. Appetizer items such as kama, gyoza, yakitori, and even takoyaki. But you won't find any udon or ramen, grilled pork, spicy tuna on rice crackers, etc. There is a blackboard with daily special however.  The quality of the fish is similar to Goyemon or any other AYCE sushi restaurant, not Sushi Dai, but definitely not shark chum. The service was above average, but sometimes the chefs were a little distracted with the tv or chatting with each other.  I guess you can describe this Sushi Mon as \"Goyemon-lite\" or a little brother to Goyemon. It is a solid AYCE sushi addition to the west side of the valley for anyone who doesn't want to drive all the way to Sushi Mon's \"older brother.\"",

    "text": "One star for having roaches and poor service.   First time trying out this location with my boyfriend. (He's tried the one on Maryland and loved it; we go to Goyemon -my favorite, on Decatur all the time).  Sat around for ten minutes at the bar before we ordered some rolls (AYCE of course). The rolls took a while to be made (very slow in comparison to all other AYCE sushi restaurants) especially considering how many customers were dining. It was just us, another couple, and one other lady. Luckily I eat pretty slow so I wasn't kept waiting too long between rolls. My boyfriend, however, really had to slow down his pace and did have to wait for new rolls. Btw, there were four sushi chefs working behind the bar. You definitely need to order as much as you can when you figure out what you want or else you will be waiting a while for your food to come.   The server didn't come and take the drink order until after our food already came. Again, keep in mind that they made the rolls relatively slow (and we only made two nigiri and two half roll orders). So we were already eating by the time she brought our two waters.   Skip to the end of the meal...after we order dessert we notice a baby roach crawling on the menu right in front of us on the bar. We didn't make a big deal (as gross as it was); my boyfriend just squished its guts out with his napkin. But to make matters worse, when we were brought our bill, they charged us for dinner instead of lunch. We brought it to their attention that we were already seated by 3:50 (dinner doesn't start until 4:00 and we weren't going to pay an extra $10 when we didn't even order any dinner specials -namely the green tea creme brulee  which I love). The server then came back and informed us that their computer said that we came in at 4:10 and that's when I called bull. I specifically remembered looking at the clock when we got our waters and it was 4:07. Again, we waited forever for our drinks, and if we got the drinks at 4:07 then how the hell did we walk in and get seated at 4:10? They finally decided to CORRECT the bill from dinner to lunch, but our whole experience was already ruined at that point. Will definitely not be making a return to this restaurant.",

The fish were as fresh as you could hope for here in vegas -- comparable to goyemon (another favorite sushi place). Their rolls were good though none stands out -- but they will make you custom rolls which is great! Aside from our usual nigiris: super white tuna, yellow tail, salmon, eel, red snapper; we always order: frying jason, volcano, dragon roll, mussels, orgasmic salad and whatever else is on the daily special board. They have a more extensive (with grilled fish) dinner menu so its also worth going there for dinner but 808 sushi offers more grilled fish than sushi mon so thats where we go if we feel like having sushi/grilled fish for dinner.  Sushi Mon's service was great and friendly. We get our orders without noticing how long it has been... And we order a lot to get our money's worth! The flow of food coming our way was exceptional and they always refill our teas. The place is small enough that wait staff always see you if you're trying to get their attention.   One thing i will always come back here for is their lychee sherbet!!! There's not a lot of restaurants here that serve lychee sherbet... its always worth the drive to have a little of this treat!",

The food is 4 stars for me.  The new upgraded design was nice but the service is getting worst every time I go there.   I've always enjoying the service and conversation with couple Thai ladies and Yuki ( I think that was her name ) They are seem very polite, give us attentions and make the place feel welcome, But lately I haven't seen them much ( maybe my schedule have changed ) I went there on Thursday night (3/13/14) it was 3 groups of people only and I still received a shitty service from them!   The waitress were so MEAN!! For some reason which is I do not understand at all. We are a customer who going to give you tips and pay for what we eat!  We are not begging you for a free food!!! There were No smile No Hello No goodbye  No thank you!!! Just a simple unhappy face like this :(  When I ordered she do not give me and signal that she got it just walk away. When she brought the food she just drop it next to me not even in front of me then walk away.  We have to waved to get their attention. It was horrible.   We are hoping that the service somehow get better. Maybe I'll go back maybe I won't.",

They have some of the same appetizers, some of the same specials, and some of the same desserts.

The fish cuts are weird, the assembly of the sushi is different, and the rice is cool. When I say cool I don't mean cool like the button you're gonna hit after reading my review, but cool temperature. Perhaps they don't have the same rice warmer as Goyemon, but to eat cold uni and cold rice, blehhhhh.  Better than some AYCE places, but I will be continue my travels to Goyemon land.",

Definitely one of the best experience in town. He is from Hawaii which made the conversation more comfortable. Although you can only have ama ebi, you can have all your can each ama ebi shrimp heads (which is my favorite). The salmon special was good and huge. Everything else was so delicious, I can't wait to go back.",

Ordering off the menu was a fine, the combination box offered chicken, tuna, salmon, California roll, tempura, rice, salad and miso soup. Sushi was very tasty and the drinks menu reasonably priced. The spot was well frequented by locals, always a good sign for out of town visitors like my group. Atmosphere pretty plain, we sat at one of the few tables that feel squeezed in.  Contrary to other reviews we saw only Japanese sushi chefs working behind the bar. We saw the ACYE option during lunch, the dinner menu offers more options than the lunch. Given the rather strict rules including the 45 minute time limit, I doubt we would have tried it anyway.",

We were actually there for an hour yesterday and got 1 roll each. We were told they hadn't even started making our other food yet. When we got there it was dead slow! About 20 minutes in it got very busy. That's fine it's busy. But if I'm waiting an hour for rolls they shouldn't be falling apart as I pick them up. It was awful. We finally just paid for what we had received so far and cancelled our other order. 90 minutes total we were there. $25 check with no tip left and my husband and I each ate a single roll. We will not be coming back.",

We love Sushi Mon on Maryland and Silverado and we've also had plenty of good dinners here at the Sahara location but the last few times my husband has gotten sick while still at the restaurant. And today out of all days we both are home  with food poisoning. We don't have to be a doctor to know that going to the bathroom over n over n over again .. we started to feel our stomach turn while eating so we didn't finish and instead got up to pay and to let them know we didn't finish so that they could charge us for whatever we wastes but before we could say anything the lady who i'm pretty sure is the manager came to us very rudely and in front of everyone saying \"this is a NO NO in all you can eat\" which we know and is why we went to the front to let them know. We have spent tons of money here and bring all our family from out of town to both locations and we will not be returning to this location again.",

Lol  My friends and I went there for Lunch AYCE, it was like $24 including tax.  We had half orders on a lot of the rolls because that way we can try a little bit of everything.  I do have to warn you on the 911, we are not kidding. I eat a lot of spicy food but I could barely handle the 911. They straight up use ghost peppers for it because I know what ghost peppers taste like.  LOVE their nigiri because they don't give you too much rice like other places which is super great. I love it.  Would definitely come back to this place.  And I definitely recommend everyone to go there and try the food themselves because it's not bad at all.",

We called the restaurant and the manager said to go to the doctor and have the doctor prove that it was their food which made her sick. Really? And how do I do that? Besides waffles this morning she had nothing else to eat, and the fact that her other friends got sick also should speak for itself. I just found out that one of the others called as well and the manager said she wasn't sorry that they got sick! How absolutely pathetic.

    "text": "Sushi Mon has been my go-to place for probably 14 years. But I don't think I can ever go back again in good conscience. This is due to 3 issues in the past year that make it too hard for me to want to spend my money there.   A year ago, December 2017 I attempted to redeem a stamp card that had, admittedly, expired a week before. I get it, it was expired... But really?   No problem, I didn't run to Yelp and post a bad review. Instead, I kept coming here.   Second, sometime earlier this year, I went in late one night. It was still over 30 minutes before last seating as posted on the door and I was absolutely turned away!  I was so upset, but just chalked that up to being so starved that night.   Thirdly, on December 15th I went in to eat by myself. I told the hostess lady \"1 for the bar\".  She wrote down my name on the log. I was confused because there was at least 3 open seats at the bar. I asked her why the wait and she said there were people ahead of me. I was standing by the hostess counter and looked at the log. There was no one waiting for a seat at the bar. There was a party of 8 ahead of me on the log. That was it.  The hostess lady seemed very confused. Turns out, from the conversations I overheard, there were 2 large groups! The hostess was confused, only wrote down one, and gave the big table away to the group she did not write down!    Anyway, a server there (I'm so sorry, I forget your name) noticed me standing there and said something to the hostess about why I have not been seated. The hostess stated again about people before me.   At this point I engaged the hostess.  I said there is no one before me waiting for the bar. She kept talking about the large group... I said they are a large group they are waiting for a table. I want a seat at the bar and counted out 5 open seats at the bar. But that was all lost on the hostess. I just smiled, said thank you and walked out.  She just didn't get it. Had I stayed, I would have had to wait for an open seat at the bar until she seated the other big group at a table just because \"they were there before me\".   I like Sushi Mon. I like the staff mostly, the servers have always been good, and I like the sushi. But this was the last straw for me. And I just realized, all three of these incidents happened at night.   There are sushi restaurants at every intersection. I'll just have to find a new one.",

I've come here several times and the 45 minute rule has never been enforced. But I would understand if the place was busy and the rules were enforced.   On a Sunday, we had a party of 5 with a baby and arrived at about 12pm. There were only 1 other party there and someone sitting at the bar. When we were seated, our server told us to wait to start our orders because our last person had not arrived and they would start the 45 minutes when we ordered (fair enough to ask us to wait, but then he kept insisting to enforce the 45 minute rule on us, when there was practically no one else in the restaurant).   When we started ordering, he could not keep up with us and we were waiting for our orders to come out. Our waters were never refilled until we asked. And somewhere in the middle of our meal, the uncensored version of \"F*@k It\" by Eamon started to play. And I asked the server to please change the music because it's disturbing to eat to it and it's making us very uncomfortable. He came back and said that it was Pandora and it could not be changed so we had to wait another 2-3 minutes for the song to end....sounds like a very family friendly place!   The restaurant got busy towards 1pm when our \"time was 5 minutes over\" and our last order took forever to get out to us. I almost went to the kitchen to scoop our mochi ice cream orders myself.   Overall, I thought it was sad service that makes me reluctant to go back again. I'm sure I'll find another AYCE sushi place again soon.",

The Japanese men and women who worked here were super on their feet and happy and just a totally different atmosphere.   Now whoever works there has made this place go from a 5 to a zero.   1. The people you hire to cut your sushi should all be fired. Cutting sushi isn't just a skill it's a skillful art. If a human doesn't have the anatomy of a fish in his mind as readily as they do the alphabet then they never should cut fish.   Now the sashimi and nigiri are cut horribly. I've been in there through different chefs and all horrible now.   We went in late to grab some sushi two weekends ago and when they started bringing out the fresh salads I got turned off. Overly watered saturated everything because they are sitting on product. Buying in masses and not selling it fast enough yet serving it til it's on its last leg. Yuck no ty !   There fish and the way each chef cuts it is BAD. Don't go here. These people own goyemon and that new place on warm springs.  They've made their first sushi places so bad when they were once good only to lead you to their new sushi place where they charge three times as much now.   I'm over sushimon and goyemon their owners have zero care for the people in Las Vegas who's helped make them successful",

The fish/seafood is not fresh. Their regular meals are OK. Service is still good. I haven't been back to this place since there are plenty of better options for Japanese food in town.",

The fresh scallops are now only one order per person, they haven't been serving salmon belly as a special in a while, avocado in philly roll was brown and tiny, and my sister even noticed that the tempura ice cream doesn't come with a cherry on top anymore. Sushi chefs are attentive but service from servers suck. It's like they forgot about you after the second order. Even when I want to pay it takes forever. It sucks, but guess I'll be making the trip down to goyemon to get my scallops",

We always go there late (after 8pm) to avoid the crowd.  Their daily specials are great and we love their menu choices.  We have been going there for the last 3 years, and we do notice the changes (different chefs, different waiters, waitresses) since the beginning of 2018. Nevertheless, we will continue going there. It's great food at a great value!",

    "text": "First I want to say that my family and I have been going here for years. So I definitely noticed the difference when there's a new owner of the restaurant, one of them is that the sushi chefs that were regularly there are no longer there. The other is that they put some limitations on a few items, and took out a few others, which is understandable since the new owners want to try something different and make up for the money they need to get back.  I've been here a few times before making this review since I wanted to wait and see how their service and food were compared to before... and I have to say, it's about the same. The staff were friendly, and do their best to give you the service you deserve. This particular rating is for my recent visit to the establishment. Our chef for this day was Eric. He was kind, personable, and efficient. He took his time when it came to creating our sushi and asked where we were from. Being seated at the bar, I feel that there's definitely some kind of small interaction needed between clients and chef... and he did a great job doing so. He didn't push for conversation but remained interested in us. Our servers were very down-to-earth and didn't rush us at all even though it was the lunch time rush-hour.   I still wish they had the chocolate mousse and green tea creme brulee because that was something I looked forward to every time I came here. But I understand the need to cut down cost for a small business.",

Obviously, it's the same menu but the quality seemed a little lower and I really like having more of sushi specials.   Overall, I would definitely say I would try it again.",

I've never had an issue with bad fish, usually there's something there on the special fish menu that I love. Sometimes they'll have the salmon belly for lunch (actually most the time now). I know there was a period of adjustment for them and I've stuck with em through the management change. These guys always kill it, guys at the bar are always there when i finish my rolls to see if I'd like more. If you're a fan of salmon, salmon belly, yellowtail or super white tuna - it's always fantastic here. Keep on bringing new special fish daily options to try. Thank you",

I've had some favorite locations to eat all you can eat sushi in the Las Vegas area in the past but this place just tops them all. Not only is the sushi freshly made and tastes great but the staff was very friendly and accommodating to my every need.   I recommend eating at the sushi bar if it's just a party of two. Awesome service & you can directly place custom orders to the chef too. This is the only location that I know that you can tell them how many sushi rolls you want to have. If I want a 4 piece California role. Walla, done!    I came during dinner time and there was a wait, the location isn't big and sometimes I can imagine big parties during theses times. Overall I highly recommend Sushi Mon to all my friends. I'm definitely coming back!",

J.J Mahalo - Spam-tastic! Tiger - my favorite! Fans of shrimp tempura! Cynthia  Royal California - if you like CA rolls, this is a must try. Spider - we ordered plenty of this! Delish.  The side dishes we ordered were:  Edamame - YES! Steamed AND Fried Gyoza - Eh. Steamed Shumai - Eh. Fried Calamari - So good! We killed three orders. Vegetable Tempura - I wish they had broccoli tempura...  Shrimp Tempura - A MUST HAVE! Octupus Poki - First time trying this... not too fond of it. Seaweed Salad - A MUST HAVE! So good.  For dessert, we had:  Green tea mochi - I didn't like the texture of the gooey shell around the ice cream.  Green tea creme brulee chocolate mousse  The service was awesome! The Filipino server was very attentive and friendly.   Our bill came out to be 127$ for 4 AYCEs (@27/person) and a small and large Sapporo.",

They get mad if you don't finish every grain of their rice. \"That's a 'no no'. You must eat all rice or they charge you\" says the waitress. Who is \"they\"? Lol   Quality of cuts is not good as the sushi \"chef\" leaves the tough \"silver skin\" in the fish, making it disappetizing. Add the excessive rice clump to the mix and you get expensive gas station quality sushi.  1 star for the can of Febreeze in the bathroom.  Thank you ;)  Tip: You can easily dump their excess sushi by putting all of it into a napkin and flushing it into their toilet! Or load your mouth and spit it into the toilet, if you don't want to keep asking for napkins!)  Health: Kitchen has a moldy stink to it. You may want to give it a wiff while waiting for your table. You may change you dining plans afterwards. I didn't notice it until I went to dump my rice load.   Go to Kazuki Sushi on Decatur. WAY BETTER AYCE!",

The actual owners are working everyday there and the chef was apparently from Sushi Mon (authentic Japanese guy), but left to start his own restaurant. I love his place. Tastes like Sushi Mon, but better. AYCE for one is 18 and 22 for dinner! My family and friends go to Naka Sushi all the time now instead of sushi mon. Friendlier/warmer service, great for family and groups, and yummy food.  Honestly think I'm just paying for the ambience and the new decoration at Sushi Mon. The service and sushi was okay.

The service was great. Easy to call service all the time. Also recommend sitting at sushi bar. It is easier to order when you sit in front of the chef.  The sushi chef remembered me from yesterday and started to make sushi for me after asking me if I want similar sushi/ portions from yesterday. The dessert green tea ice cream was kind of lacking, but the tempura ice cream was very good.   Overall I would recommend anyone to eat here. I would personally come here regularly if I lived around the area.",

Maybe by giving this info they will be able to clean up their act and maybe in the future regain my trust but I doubt it seeing what I saw, to me that was just nasty and they should have more pride with what they do dealing with food and the public.",

We were seated at a table, since the sushi bar was full.  Once we were waited on, I noticed the waiter was sort of rushed to take our order.  After our first round, of the \"All you can eat\" deal, the waiter quickly came around and asked if we wanted dessert.  He kept rushing us by asking the same question each time he came back to our table.  Then shortly after he placed the bill on our table. And again, kept coming back to the table to check if we had paid the bill.  This all within 30min of being seated.  We understood there is a time limit, but found it quite rude to have the waiter continuously lifting up the bill to check if we had paid it.  After about 4x of this, I explained to the waiter we would pay at the register, he insisted on having us pay at the table bc they need to clear the table for the next guests.  Meanwhile my husband, still chewing his food, I asked the waiter if my husband could at least finish eating. The waiter then turned and walked away. We received a dismissive apology when we told the cashier we were rushed out of our table.  At least my husband finished his last bite, walking out the door I guess.  Worst. Service. Ever.",

    "text": "Sushi Mon is the sister restaurant to Goyemon, which is one of my favorites, so Sushi Mon is definitely a 5-star in my books as well!  Sushi Mon is on the West side of town, and my family and I love this place. We used to go about once a month to this location when we weren't going to Goyemon across town. We would go for either lunch ($21.95/person) or dinner ($26.95/dinner). Since the menus are essentially the same between the two, I want to call out a lot of the same reasons why we love Sushi Mon.   Firstly, there are some advantages to going for dinner - 1) they serve salmon belly nigiri, which is way better than getting regular salmon nigiri and 2) you can get 1 order of uni (sea urchin) and 1 order of amaebi (sweet shrimp). Other than these two things, you can pretty much order everything else, including the AYCE dessert, during lunch. The major differences between Sushi Mon and Goyemon is that Goyemon has grilled fish items for dinner, as well as ramen after 11pm, so if you want those items, check out Goyemon instead.  Anyway, our typical order when we go for dinner at Sushi Mon includes the following items:  1) nigiri - salmon belly, hamachi (yellowtail), saba (mackerel), super white tuna, uni (sea urchin), amaebi (sweet shrimp), snow crab meat, unagi (fresh water eel), and ikura (salmon roe) 2) rolls - Sexy Girl, Hurricane, Sushi Mon Style Lasagna 3) side dishes - steamed gyoza, yakitori, shrimp and vegetable tempura, sashimi salad, miso soup, baked green mussels, udon 4) dessert - lychee sorbet, green ice cream, strawberry mochi, green tea creme brulee  Just like Goyemon - this is one of the easiest 5-star ratings I can give on Yelp. The only complaint I have about Sushi Mon is that the wait can be long as well, although we've noticed that the wait isn't as long as Goyemon. The restaurant is not all that big, and if you have a group bigger than 4, it can take about an hour to get seated.   If you ever go to Las Vegas (and you are still reading this review), promise me you'll go to Sushi Mon or its sister restaurant, Goyemon. Ok? Cool, thanks!",

Staff is friendly, food is fresh and above average. they just need more room at this location. overall, I would recommend it.",

We came into town & my sis happened to remind me of Sushi Mon so we came back after maybe 10 years to see if it was still good ... And it was! We did the all-you-can-eat dinner. I ate a ton of hamachi nigiri without worrying about the bill being racked up. The salmon was a little tough though. the new thing was a time limit and signs saying you'll be charged if you don't eat everything but I think that was mainly for people who just eat the sashimi & leave piles of uneaten rice. I understand they don't want waste now to lose money so it didn't bother me too much. Service was great - not too often and not pushy on drinks or upsales. Good food & service for the right sushi price. We'll be back again!",

My favorites are the Lemon and Yebisu, but Sunrise is great as well. Such delicious, fresh seaweed salad! The staff was friendly and the on-floor manager was really great and attentive. They were even very patient with us when we (accidentally) ended up staying past closing. Limited hours compared to the Maryland location, but it worked out!  Only downside (and reason for 4/5 stars) was that my party had a deep fried roll (Sexy Girl perhaps?) that still had a piece of Saran Wrap stuck to it when it was brought to the table. The staff apologized profusely and did offer to remake the roll. This seems to be a common issue, but they appear to be making steps to rectify it. Otherwise, will definitely return!",

We ordered doubles of some and ordered some other things.  They also prepared an awesome beautiful dessert of Fried Ice Cream w/ Mango & Strawberry Mochi We stuffed our bellies and everything was so delicious and fresh.

I don't like rice and they have a limited selection of rolls without rice and no sashimi, so naturally I ordered sushi and simply didn't eat the rice. The polite waitress let us know that we would get charged for left over rice! What? That's a new level of craziness!  They didn't charge us after all but being dictated on what and how to eat the food that I PAY for is an automatic no-no on my list and I will never be back nor recommend this restaurant.",

When our orders were taken we were asked if we \"wanted anything else\" and then given to a different server. Tables that were seated after us were served first and they didn't even acknowledge that we were sitting down. We are also in the middle of the restaurant so it's not like we are tucked away in a corner to be ignored.   We were just served our food 40 minutes after ordering and when we were asked if everything was okay we mentioned our concern about the tjme we were waiting and were told that \"we don't need to worry about the time limit and the bigger orders are served first to preserve time\". 40 minutes to wait for sushi is absurd. We were ignored, passed by, and watched tables seated 10-20 minutes after us happily eating. We won't be back.",

I should have headed my warnings but I decided to order the spiciest special roll there.

When you eat nigiri, the rice should complement the fish but it's more overwhelming in this case. Hot tea is also no longer free :(.

The environment however is so disgusting that I had to walk out of the restaurant. It is so disappointing. We went here not too long ago and we left because there wasn't unagi. So we thought we'd give it a try again today, for Mother's Day. We waited for at least half an hour. Some customers before us left too. When we got in we didn't get our waters immediately which was fine, since it was busy. We understand. Whoever the server was that was assisting us was absolutely rude. My mother immediately felt like she wouldn't get good service and that means a lot to us since it's Mother's Day. As soon as I sat down (coming back from the restroom), even giving her my drink order was so difficult.. I immediately got up and walked out with my family. Absolutely disappointing. Honestly, this used to be a good restaurant, good fresh food, good servers .. but not. Not anymore.. I will never return to this restaurant again.. No unagi, because they only serve it on \"weekdays\".. bad energy.. and rude servers. I was happy to leave that place.   My family and I ended up going to Sushi Zone on spring mountain. Much MUCH better services and they had what we wanted. AND my family left happy!",

    "text": "Arrived just before lunch was over on a weekday so there were few others in the restaurant. Sergio was our waiter, and he was attentive and fast with our orders. I order in small batches because I titrate my degree of fullness and don't want to leave food on the table. Perhaps because I don't overeat and the restaurant wasn't busy, I have never been told my 45 minutes were up.   Compared to other AYCEs I think the quality of the sushi is better than most but the appetizer selection is a bit limited compared to Oyshi. The hamachi is my my benchmark and it is a beautiful cut of soft fish. There are no beef appetizers at all. Salad and miso soup is good and I liked the tempura and gyoza and shumai. Rolls are good and like that they do half rolls, when you want to try something new. Dessert is excellent as they have the best green tea ice cream.  All in all this is a great AYCE. Not as fancy as Oyshi but pleasant atmosphere and good pop-hiphop music tracks. For dinner I probably prefer the elegance and beef/pork sizzling hot plates at Oyshi but this is my preferred lunch establishment.",

    "text": "Summary: Disappointed  Cons:  -Probably the worst fish to rice ratio at an ayce sushi place I have been too. I have been to almost all of the ayce sushi place in orange county and only a handful of ayce sushi places in LA, but I have never seen a worse rice to rise ratio for both the nigri pieces and the rolls. Actually some of the rolls were ridiculous large, especially the 5 piece rolls. The biggest rolls I have ever seen. When the menu states that you will be charge for extra rice, and then the rolls comes out a gigantic and filled with rice. Should have taken a picture of this.   -Service. Our server was new, but overall very nice and did the best he can. We asked him if we can get a spider hand roll and he wasn't sure. My biggest gripe is that we have a kid. Most AYCE places have a different price for kids. He failed to mention this. A kid that is 8 years old should not be charge the same price as an adult, if everybody is charged the same price the restaurant should let customers know.   -From the rice to fish ratio, to not disclosing the price difference, can't help but feel a bit of disingenuous on part of the owner. At the very least it is a lack of disclosing information that could easily enhanced a customer's experience.   Pros: The freshness and quality of the fish is above average in comparison to most of the ayce places I have been to. Too bad you only get to get a thin slice/small piece of it. If it wasn't for the quality of the fish, this place would really get one star.",

Restaurant is always clean as well, including the bathrooms.  Everything here is delicious. I've never had one thing here that wasn't, and I've tried pretty much everything on the menu. However, they changed their menu pretty recently and got rid of a lot of the dinner specials. This makes me sad. Their \"love boat\" dinner special was the best! They still have a lot of dinner specials though, like the salmon special, which is so good and such a great value.  I don't think they have their volcano #2 roll either, which was amazing!  I've never done the all you can eat sushi here, so I can't vouch for that.",

The variety of different sashimi / sushi rolls / appetizers makes this place well worth the $26.95 for dinner.    There are some sashimi's that you can only order just one per person because of how expensive it is, but at least you get to try it still.    The people working there were really nice.  It wasn't too busy, but I herd when it gets busy that the food takes awhile to come out.  You have to make sure that you eat all your food along with the rice or else you'll get charged extra.    I'll definitely come back to this place when I come back to Vegas!",

    "text": "Oy. I don't even know where to start. My friends have gone to the Sushi Mon over on Maryland before, and one of them got pretty ill, but she gets sick pretty easily so I didn't necessarily think it was cause to boycott all Sushi Mon locations in the state. How wrong I was.   I was here the other night on a date (his choice), and I was immediately underwhelmed by the super small interior, fishy smell, and the fact that they said the wait was 20 min but ended up being 35. We finally got seated at the bar and opted for the AYCE, which I normally never do, but seemed like a good idea so I could order some uni and salmon belly. I was slightly skeptical about the quality of the fish, but I've eaten a lot of gross things in my day and figured it couldn't be thaaat bad.   Well, a few pieces of sushi into the meal, a beetle comes crawling across my plate. That's right, a BEETLE. I sprang into action and crushed that sucker with my napkin, as it became incredibly clear that my date was paralyzed by bugs. Too stunned and disgusted to fully comprehend what just happened, I was in the process of looking around for a server to tell them what I saw when ANOTHER BEETLE came crawling up from under the sushi bar and onto my plate. At this point I jumped up from my seat and my date's face was white, (I was grossed out but also found this whole scenario incredibly funny, and I felt really bad for him), and as small as the place was, no other diners really seemed aware that they were eating next to bugs, and what's more alarming is that the employees barely cared!! A busser came over to take my napkins with the bugs in them that I had already killed, mumbled out an apology, and went on his way. We had to then ask for the bill so we could get out of there, but that was it, no other apology, no comping of anything, we barely ate more than 4 pieces of nigiri and they still charged us for 2 AYCE meals. Absurd.   Bugs on Sahara, recorded illnesses on Maryland, horrible service at both. Health Inspector...where are you!?",

They also said it wasn't the freshest and the slices of fish were small.  There are many other AYCE options in Vegas for consideration.",

We had to ask multiple times for them to check on our order and finally they asked us what items we were waiting for.  Once we told them,  the waitress left and then came back 5 minutes later asking us again what we had left! We are now leaving hungry and angry to a place we will never come back to again.

The old owners took a lot of pride in treating the customers well and serving high quality sushi. since it was sold, the decor might be improved but the customer service and food quality stinks! They scrimp on the servings and the service. Also,I went there on a Tuesday night, after the main dinner crowd had left.  Only 2 tables were filled with customers and they refused to seat me at any table but a tiny one facing into a corner.  I am glad there are a lot of Sushi Restaurant choices on the west side, I've taken my business elsewhere.",

I always get the seaweed salad as a starter because of how fresh it tastes, and then basically any bit of sushi, nigiri, and side that they offer on the AYCE menu. I then finish off with one of their desserts such as the mochi ice cream, green tea ice cream, or litchi ice cream. Sometimes they are out of the strawberry mochi (which is my favorite) but I'm fine with getting their other flavors when that happens. While this place is kind of small, it is around the corner from my house so it is the one we always go to. I don't feel like the wait time for food is that bad; if you order several sushi dishes at once they bring the next out just as you finish off the last dish. Go as a group and all get the AYCE so you can share. Lastly, if you order an nigiri, don't forget to request their fresh wasabi to go with it!",

Although the food is good (thanks to the sushi chefs) and reasonable, the service or lack thereof is poor to say it politely. They are simply unfriendly and border on rude at times and they act like they do not care whatsoever whether you come back or not. They do not show any appreciation for our patronage either, which is irritating to say the least when you spend your hard earned money. So much so it makes the whole experience unenjoyable.  It's too bad because we enjoy the food and love sushi and since we live nearby, we want one of those places that we can go to often and you know them and they know and its always a pleasant meal and experience. However, after eating here 4 times and hoping the service will be better each time, it just isn't and we walk out saying well at least the food was good. We really want this to be our place but I guess we'll have to give our hard earned money to another establishment that appreciates it. Very disappointing. If I could give 0 stars I would. Again, this review is not a reflection on the sushi chefs at all, the food is good, its the service and management that has driven us not to return.",

After the first round of orders the quality of the service & sushi went down drastically. The server let us sit for 15min after taking our plates from the first order before returning to take our follow up orders. When the 2nd order had been placed, our server returned 10min later & rudely questioned if we could even finish our order. This led to another 10min wait before receiving our food. I understand having to serve & accommodate other orders/customers, but the delivery of our food was a slow & drawn out process, especially when compared to the super quick food drops when we first sat down. Sushi that was supposed to be hot was cold, & the cold sushi was warm as if it had been sitting out. At this point we knew we were no longer wanted. After flagging down our server, we requested dessert along with the bill. The mochi was on point, but the tempura ice cream was presented in a soggy condition, ending our evening at this establishment. All of this & they had the nerve to ask for a 12% percent gratuity on the check. They treated us horribly as customers. We were not loud in anyway,  rude or disrespectful in any manner, or deserving of this horrendous customer service. I would not recommend this establishment to anyone. Don't waste your time or money.",

Their 9-1-1 roll, a past favorite, tasted like nothing but crappy habanero hot sauce. The staff was good and friendly until we were ready to leave. We wondered why they had not come by with the check and when we asked, they told us we had a single piece of sushi left out of the 6 rolls we ate and we were told unless we ate the last bite, they would charge us.  I've seen this policy before on many places but have never seen it implemented in such an unfriendly way.

The place itself is quite small, and features a sushi bar, several tables, and booths. The service here is just lovely; everyone--from the waiters to the sushi chefs--is both kind and courteous. Whenever I enter, I'm always politely greeted by nearly everyone who works there.  The All-You-Can-Eat special at Sushi Mon is probably the best I've seen in the entire Las Vegas valley. For around $25 per person, you can choose as many different types of sushi rolls as you'd like from menus with images of virtually every item available for your convenience. Every roll--cold or baked--is made and served in a timely manner. My personal favorites are the Caterpillar, Lasagna, and Pixie rolls!  The side-dishes offered at Sushi Mon are lovely, as well. They've got anything you might possibly desire, from tuna and octopus poke to cucumber and seaweed salad, miso soup, and baked mussels. One of their newest additions is the sashimi salad, which is simply to die for.  The dessert is, without saying, extraordinary. The green tea ice cream is a must, as are their various flavors of mochi. If you're looking for a quaint little place to have sushi or any other Japanese dishes, this is the place to be!",

Had no issues parking and came at 1pm just a few hours after opening.   After the disappointment at 808 tapas I've been craving some good sushi, especially an AYCE spot. In comes Sushi Mon, their AYCE is $21.95 and they give you 45 minutes to eat. 45 minutes may not seem like a lot but at the speed they make them in and how much you can order its more than enough time.   I ordered some nigiri, salmon, squid, and cajun albacore along with 007 roll, JJ roll, pastel, and alaskan roll. It was all very delicious, service was super fast and very efficient. I was completely stuffed when I walked out and more than satisfied.   Whats great about this place is if you really want to try something but don't want the 8 pieces, they let you get a half order's with 4 pieces, so you can really try a diverse selection rather than get stuffed on a few items. Remember anything you don't finish they charge you for so make sure your eyes aren't bigger than your stomach.  Get their frequent dining card, after the 10th AYCE you get one free, whats great is if your with someone and they get the AYCE it counts as two on your card so if you go with people that don't go often get credit for their meal. All in all I enjoyed my lunch, at dinner its 3 dollars more for their AYCE and they give you 15 more minutes for a total of 1 hour.",

There are usually two people who wait on you; one who takes your food order and one who does drinks and brings your stuff. The young guy we had was very nice and acknowledged us. The much older short lady was rude. Got forbid she takes your order, she rolls her eyes at you as if you are bothering that you're spending money.   I doubt we will return.

It's okay, but not the same service -- probably because our regular sushi chefs went to Goyemon.   They have the same menu as before but the quality is different. I know you're thinking, how I can tell, but if you've gone to the same place for years and the fish doesn't taste the same, then I have to say the quality is different.   On the other hand, compared to many of the other sushi restaurants, I think it passes for OK. The new service is friendly.  If you're nearby and you needed AYCE sushi place, try it. It might not be the best, but probably a good value.",

    "text": "Sushi Mon's Chef Soto is one of Las Vegas' best-kept secrets!* Go right before lunch ends, around 3PM, sit at the bar, and make a new friend.  I  have him do an omakase-style meal of nigiri and the daily specials (which are all reliably great!), and eat until I can't anymore. Soto is good at pacing so you can enjoy quite a few pieces of fish before unbuttoning your pants or admitting defeat, and is quite charming to make conversation with as you munch.  Stellar stand-outs: fresh scallop, garlic tuna, cajun albacore, tuna hand roll, ika with mint (totally crazy!), and the sea bass. Sides of mussels, miso, orgasm salad and/or sashimi salad are also good add-ons.   I'm not too big on rolls here unless I'm ordering to-go, but the Lemon roll, Crispy Spicy Roll, and Moon roll are all good picks- they have quite an extensive menu organized by specials, fried rolls, and tempura rolls and most have pictures to accompany them.  For dessert, I tend to stick to the classic green tea ice cream which is never gritty or chalky, while my BF swears by their tempura ice cream (today's special flavor was chocolate-fudge), but they also have a green tea creme brulee on the dinner menu that I've been meaning to try.  All the staff here are incredibly friendly and genuine, but Chef Soto is my favorite. Even if he's not working, all the guys are willing to feed you the best quality and best tasting fish in town, served with a smile and a joke or two.  EDIT: dropping my rating. Chef Soto and several other familiar faces behind the bar are gone, and with them the top-notch service and quality I've loved about this place.",

I was being lazy one night and didn't want to dine in, so I got my food to go. Staff was friendly and my order came out quickly. I ordered three rolls:  Sushi Mon Lasagna Pastel  Domingo  One thing to note is that the sauces come on the side with to go orders. This is good because it gives me a chance to try the rolls naked. I loved the Domingo roll. It has tuna and avocado with jalapeno salsa on top and ponzu sauce. This roll was super tasty as is, but the addition of ponzu sauce upped the ante for me. I wouldn't hesitate to order this again.  The lasagna was a second favorite. This roll is very decadent. Cream cheese and scallops baked on top of a California roll and smothered in eel sauce. Soooo good and probably a billion calories a piece, but so worth it. I was hesitant the first time I ever tried a lasagna roll. Who knew cream cheese would be so good with fish? Not me. But it is amazing. This is a very rich roll so maybe try half if you have never had it before.   The pastel was good as well but was my least favorite. It had shrimp and crab wrapped in soy paper, and shrimp and avocado on top. I omitted the cream cheese from this roll but it does come with it. After that lasagna roll I couldn't think about eating more cream cheese. Eel sauce and spicy mayo top this, but I felt like the sauces didn't add much to a pretty plain roll.   While I sat and waited for my order I was offered water which I declined but thought was nice. Everyone I came across was nice and they even thanked me for waiting. I will be back for the AYCE- Lunch is $21.95 and dinner is $26.95.",

    "text": "Sushi mon was A-OK. We were pressed for time so we just wanted something quick, easy and that would fill us up.   We tried 3 different rolls:   Spider roll - (5pcs) Deep fried soft shell crab, crab meat, cucumber and avocado wrapped in soy paper with eel sauce $9.95- The soy paper was green so it looked interesting. The fried crab flavor was faint and almost tasted like shrimp tempura. I wouldn't say it's the best roll I've ever ate, it was basic and not memorable.  Volcano roll - (8pcs) California roll with yum yum sauce & scallop  $8.95 - it was smothered in yum yum mayo/eel sauce. I'm not complaining since I love that decadent stuff.   Caterpillar roll - (8pcs) Eel and cucumber wrapped with sliced avocado & eel sauce $9.95 - one of the classics! It was good, the eel was fatty and I enjoyed it. But $10 is pretty pricy in my opinion.   I think that they are overpriced for their presentation and what was offered to us. But businesses have to make their money somehow!",

Want staff that will leave you waiting and only take half your order and somehow all your food comes out the wrong temperatures when there's only a few tables? Then this is the place for you!  Complete with staff that won't help you with questions about the menu, will scream \" EXCUSE ME\" multiple times in rapid succession in your ear to take a straw wrapper off the table, and chefs who will treat you as a burden for ordering, not smile, make eye contact, and make insults about you to other chefs. All terrific highlights. I even invited company both times I've tried this place so all of us could share this experience! I'm so glad I gave this place 2 chances to \"wow\" us",

I have not had any major let downs from this place from past visits. I did go to Sushi Mon last night and a few nights before and both visit were pleasant. :)  Restaurant A bit small but it is worth the wait if you go with a group. Price is a bit more than most places but worth every single penny. :) Family oriented and clean kind of. The restrooms did have a smell but what would you expect, people do their business in there. Lol   Service Is on point, my server was very friendly and suggested a few other food items that weren't listed on the menu. She also tended to my table before the food was done/finished so waiting for the next orders wouldn't take long to wait.   Food Nigiri was awesome. Came out quick and the salmon belly is mouth watering. You just have to ask since they do run out quickly. Lol The baked mussels are fresh unlike a few other places where they get precooked mussels. :( Pork belly is good but not the best that I have tried at a sushi restaurant. They also do half orders on most of their rolls, so if your not to sure if you can finish just get half order or hand rolls.  Cons They don't  serve fresh oysters and the steamed gyoza was burt at the bottom of them :(  All in all 4.5 stars :) good job Sushi Mon.",

They filled up our glasses as needed, cleaned our dishes as often as possible. (We ordered a lot at a time for a very little table, them taking our dishes away constantly helped a lot!)   As for the food, 11/10 highly recommend! The baked mussels here are my favorite. We always do AYCE when we come here. The sushi is never dry, it's refreshing. The sushi here is never overloaded by rice like some places. It's the right amount of rice to compliment the fish.  The experience I had here was amazing. This will always be my go to spot for sushi!",

We were skeptical at first but compared to the other all you can eat sushi places in Vegas, we really liked it here.   They give you a very small amount of rice without the overpowering seasoning of Yuzu on the sushi.  The choices for appetizers and daily specials are very abundant compared to the other places.  Fish tasted fresh and pretty good for an all you can eat restaurant.  Our server was excellent and always had a smile on his face despite the numerous times we placed our orders.  The only disappointment was their dessert.   But after stuffing yourself with so much food, there is barely any room for dessert anyways.  The more popular all you can eat spots in Vegas will have you waiting for over an hour.  I think this place is less busy but offers better food.  Definitely worth the price!  Free sake when you show Facebook check in!",

The fish was still wonderful, as it always is, but the big improvment for me was the service.  We sat at the bar, and the place was packed.  Our chef was Tony, who was an absolute pleasure.    We had servers stopping by filling up our water glasses, asking if we wanted anything off the menu with the AYCE.  Everyone was polite and VERY quick.    No more waiting for 20 minutes for our check!    Also, they finally updated the website and took down the All you can drink ad that was up there forever.   I'm a little upset that they still have not replied to the emails I sent them about that, but...it is what it is.   I feel much better about going to this, my favorite All You Can Eat sushi restaurant since the service improved so much.",

It's a smaller establishment and I used to come here a bunch when it was owned by an previous owner. We were seated right away and they told me that it would be $3 bucks for my one year old to eat. That irked be a little bit, because 1. how much can a one year old really eat and 2. I was feeding my child food that I had brought at that exact moment when they asked.   Overall, the sushi quality was decent. Like other Yelpers have said the selection isn't as large as Goyemon, but the main thing was that the sushi quality was good and I actually did enjoy it. Halfway through the meal it realized one of the sushi chefs was a chef I knew from before.  Chef Tony is awesome! If I ever get a chance to sit at the bar I would want him to make my sushi.   Service was a bit slow, but the sushi came out fairly quick.  It just takes awhile to get their attention to order more when you are at a table. I will be back for some more sushi one of these days!",

    "text": "Not a fan of all you can eat places, particularly when seafood is involved. Often it is an indicator the a la carte is going to be sub par. That being said, seems many of the LV sushi places are all you can eat. Sushi Mon is close by so have tried 2x. It did the trick for a few mediocre rolls of average construction.  Tried the softshell crab tempura which had a funky been sitting in the freezer too long taste.  The service is average as well. Am unsure why this place has gotten such rave reviews. Agree with some other yelpers this place is over-hyped",

    "text": "Went there for Mother's day,  party of 3 around 9pm. First time customers, we all did the AYCE. Sushi and side dishes came out pretty quick.  Side dishes were great,  sushi was good but I've had better. My son didn't care for the uni,  as it is one of his favorites. Just the quality and lack of taste wasn't up to par for him. He ordered one of the rolls with crunchies but it tasted stale. My husband who likes spicy sms hot couldn't handle the 911 roll. The spicy tuna was great but it was an even toss up of good and not so good rolls. No sashimi (but most ayce don't have), No raw oysters (again usually you don't see that for ayce). That's okay I have my favorite spot where I get both in the ayce.  I love sweets and the bonus is that you are not limited to one dessert only.  So I really enjoyed the lychee sorbet,  mochi ice cream and tempura ice cream. The service was good, around enough to take orders and clear plates.  They just never offer refills,  even when our cup is empty we had to ask for the refills.  I would go back,  but not a big deal if I don't make it.",

Ayce is a must then you can try a bit of everything! They also do half rolls which makes it easier to taste everything. The strawberry saki was very good as well! Will definitely be coming here again!!",

    "text": "Worst experience today! We always come here (almost every week to be exact). Often we get the nice lady servers or the Japanese servers who were always so nice and funny! Unfortunately today we had this server who's fairly new compared to the others named Zac---- I don't want to spell his name out. But, the last time as well around November or so, I remember he only got 40% of our orders right which had led us to stop coming here. But then we gave this place a chance and came back from January until today. We were celebrating a birthday and my aunt, who doesn't know how to use the chopsticks very well, dropped two small pieces of rice on the bare table as she was grabbing sushi from the middle of the table. So tiny that literally if I can count the grains approximately 10 grains. So this server named Zac---- came in sarcastically implying that he was gonna charge us for those, pointing at those small pieces and rolling his eyes at the same time. My aunt felt so bad that she said she was just gonna eat it but he said oh sure don't worry about it. So what was he really implying? Never coming here again and just so you have an idea how many times we go here, we've used 5 of the stamp cards already! Note: if you're coming here and you want great service, avoid the one person with the Zac---- first letters! All the other ladies are so nice! But just avoid this one server! Ugh definitely ruined our dinner. What a guy!",
