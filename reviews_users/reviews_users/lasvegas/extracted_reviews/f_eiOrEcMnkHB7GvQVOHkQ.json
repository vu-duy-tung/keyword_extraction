I'm a little disappointed, because they used to have a \"create your own breakfast\" menu in which you got to choose the items you wanted.  However, everything I've had here has been good.  I had the seasonal fruit plate today, and it had a nice variety of melons, bananas, berries, oranges, pineapple and a small banana nut muffin.  It was great and there was enough food for two people.  The person next to me had the Greek Yogurt with Berries and Granola and that's what I'm getting next time!  That looked delicious!  The service isn't the best in the world, but I think it's because they seem a little understaffed and the waiters have to deal with a lot of tables.  I prefer Society Cafe's breakfast there, but this is still a solid choice.",

He ordered it with two slices of bread instead of 3 - tasted great. The fries that came with it were so good!!!  Super Food Salad with chicken 5/5 Huge and delicious!! I couldn't finish it. But every bite was perfect. Will order again.   Guacamole 5/5 Good sized portion for sharing with 4 people. Very flavorful and creamy.  Bloody Mary 4/5  Sangria 3/5 Good but a little too sweet  Will definitely return for a nice lunch.",

A 25-30 minute wait outside this cafe is actually a great alternative in comparison.  Overall this is more like 3.5 stars.  The line to get seated was a slow one and could've been handled better.  There were plenty of empty tables, and it almost felt like we were intentionally made to wait outside to create the illusion that the cafe is a really happening place to passersby.  The kind of stuff they do at some not-so-happening SF nightclubs.  The food itself was quite good.  More like 4.x star quality.  Ambiance was quite pleasant too.  We had the mushroom/truffle burger, a tri-tip sandwich, chicken tenders, and a crab and lobster club.  All high quality and satisfying.  You can tell how a restaurant cares about their food quality by the quality of their sides.  Even the coleslaw was done well enough that one of us who usually doesn't care for coleslaw actually enjoyed it.  I'd recommend this over The Buffet next door.",

I got the corn beef hash with my eggs scrambled and my beef hash was a little on the salty side. I had to eat my hash with the eggs so it wouldn't taste as salty. I also got the caramel latte which was pretty good and they gave us this little sugar stick for me to mix it with in my latte.  Now, the service.... Horrible horrible horrible! Keep in mind, the restaurant was not even a full house, not a lot of people were in the restaurant when we were there eating but our food took FOREVER to come out. We had 8 people at our table but still, any other restaurant can bring our foods out faster especially when our food can easily be made. My latte was the only one that came out super late while everyone else got their coffee. Usually I like to drink my latte before I eat that way I can just chill, talk to my girlfriends, and drink my latte. Instead, my friend had to flag down the waitress and tell her I waited 25 minutes for my latte and she gave me a bullshit excuse saying there must be a line cause there's only one machine. Right.... No body is here girl. Also, the waiters got most of our orders mixed up and not the way we wanted our food to be cooked. For example, my friends wanted scrambled eggs instead they got over easy. Just stupid mistakes. Didn't like the service and the food was ok. I still wouldn't come back.",

My friends and I had a few hours before our flight and came here in agreement of a semi quick bite, while still having the sit down and order ambiance that we wanted. Once we sat down we ordered an appetizer (hummus plate), soups, and our drinks. 15 minutes later a party gets seated at the next table. 10 minutes after that the same parties appetizers come out. Confused because we still hadn't received our appetizer (it was a cold dish, no cooking involved) or our soup, and with no check in from our waitress at all, I hunt her down and explain if she could check on our appetizers because we're on a slight time crunch. She never came back to update us or apologize but 5 minutes later our soups and appetizer come out. As I begin eating my soup a guy comes to refill our waters and knocks my soup over. He did not apologize, wiped the table and took the spilled soup bowl and rushes away, never returning to offer another bowl or apologize? I call the waitress to tell her (at this point she hasn't checked on us once and keeps avoiding us by checking on every other table but ours &I the party that came 20 minutes after us has finished and are leaving the restaurant) and she responds \"oh.... I'll bring you another one\" awkwardly. I am a very understanding person when it comes to service and am very appreciative towards staff even when they make a mistake (as we all do) but the way our specific waitress/ waiter treated us was horrible!! Food was blah too and did not make up for the service",

Hotels offer buffet to make loads of profits even if you think you have cleaned out that tray of whatever Alaskan or Antarctican crab legs. Fact is they bought it by the ton and it's dirt cheap for them to prepare.   As we moved by the pathetic line that crowd the buffet restaurant at Wynn, we laughed and 2 minutes later we stumbled upon Terrace Pointe Cafe. It was quite empty and the atmosphere was spot on. Plus no stupid family with kids running around with ice-cream cones.   We had a booth that was lined in red vinyl. A cafe setting that sets itself apart from what we have been to before. It surpasses the rather old-tasteless bling bling Bellagio cafe with a darker and more sinister tone. But we like! It's a cafe where couples have done sinful things and taking a break for a quick bite. It's a cafe where I can imagine Trent Reznor or Marilyn Manson would dine.  It's a cafe where if you have kids running and screaming, the servers might cage them and cook them into  sinister yet delicious soups.   What seems like an overpriced $16 smoked burger and $16 clam pasta turned out to be very good. Service was a tad bit slow but both dishes were made with care. The prices are on par to Houstons.  We ate like champions for under $35.",

    "text": "Having seen that the line for the Wynn Buffet was at least a good hour and a half long, my friends and I headed a little further down the hall to the Terrace Pointe Cafe.  The wait was only about 15 minutes; we were seated, given menus, and waited about another 15 minutes for our waitress to come over.    Once she did she was very pleasant, and got our orders in promptly.  I started with the tomato bisque, which was advertised as coming with a mini grilled cheese sandwich.  Maybe because I got the cup instead of the bowl, it didn't come with one.  The soup was WAY too sweet, but otherwise had good texture, and a nice background kick.    My entree was sorely disappointing.  I got the carne asada, which was pieces of skirt steak wrapped in corn tortillas with chopped onions and cilantro.  It came with a tomato rice, a tortilla bowl filled with pinto beans and melted cheese, and a little side of salsa.  It was all just so...bla.  Nothing about it was bad; it just wasn't that good.  The tomato rice was probably the most flavorful thing on the plate.  The portion was also way too large.  My dessert was the best part of the meal.  I got the cheesecake sampler, which came with three mini cheescakes on a plate- one plain with 2 fresh blackberries on top, one mango with fresh mango chunks on top, and the other chocolate with a truffle.  The mango was the best out of the three, although the plain was a close second, with a True New York cheesecake flavor and nice graham cracker crust.  My cafe latte was  large and very hot, which is nice since they can often be lukewarm.  The service from start to finish was super sloooow.  It took us TWO HOURS to eat lunch, and we are not slow eaters.  And considering that the delicious Wynn buffet was only $30 for the champagne brunch that day, the $45 + tip that I paid for this mediocre meal was really painful.  The one high point of the experience was the decor and ambiance of the place.  Like the rest of the Wynn, it is fresh, bright, and quirky.  I loved the white plates with sunny yellow borders, the oversized yellow coffee cups, the denim-looking napkins, and the lime green couch with navy border at the entrance.  The lower part of the seating area overlooks the beautiful pool.  Overall, quite disappointing, especially for the price.",

You get to sink into a big cushy chair on a patio overlooking the pool and all the hot babes sunbathing. Big table umbrellas spray mist all over you because it's over 100 degrees out.   The food itself is aiight, not amazing but good for sure. I highly recommend the fries! they're allllmost as good as the fries at the 24/7 cafe in the Palms... Get ranch dressing fo' dem fries! Jeah!  Oh and their coffee is seriously good.",

    "text": "Terrace Point Cafe inside the Wynn Hotel  First of all what a fabulicious luxurious hotel!  Steve Wynn got the classy swank pimping down- even the air smells better at the Wynn!  Ok back to the review for Terrace Point Cafe...I gave it a 3 star but it's not really that bad it's like a 3.75 star worthy.   I just had reasons that I couldn't give it a 4 or 5...here's why:  The decor inside the cafe is like opulence on opium....like a dreamy tea party with bright colors and beautiful shapes.  The booths are like sitting on clouds and the view of the outdoor is soothing.  The waitress Nancy was \"super\" nice.  I quote \"super\" because she was extremely overly glare-in-your-face friendly which bit us in the ass (explain later).  Ordered:    French Onion Soup (cheesy and yummy you can't go wrong with cheese, bread and onions).  Chicken Quesadillas with sour cream, salsa and guacamole...it was tasty and fulfilling (you get 5 large slices).  I asked for hot sauce and they brought me Tabasco when I really wanted Tapatio but of course the Wynn wouldn't carry such brand *BoOooo*  They have KILLER FRENCH FRIES here!  Crispy thin seasoned fries that is crunchy good!  Interesting that it was the FRIES that impressed me out of everything.  Stay Away From:  Prime Rib Cheesesteak Sandwich with mushrooms and onions...NASTY DRY BLAND disappointment!  The meat tasted like they washed away all the seasoning with water.  It was sad.  I was a sad sad girl.  How do you mess up such an easy dish!    That's not the worst part.  Our waitress came to our table afterwards and asked if we wanted a to-go box which we politely declined.  She then asked innocently, \"Are you sure?  You have a 1/2 a sandwich left!  Didn't you enjoy your meal?\"  We told her that the sandwich was dry and bland and asked if they usually serve it with au ju sauce...Do you know what she said?!?!  \"Oh yea...out of all the dishes we have that is like the worst dish to get.  I had it before and it was dry and not good.  I wouldn't recommend it.\"  First reaction:  What the hell!?  Why didn't she tell us that when we ordered it!?!?  I think being nice is cool but be honest with your customer!  She basically rubbed it in our faces and at a classy place such as the Wynn Cafe it would've been great to have the sandwich either re-made or taken off the bill...that would've bought my review to a 4 star (lol).  Second reaction:  WOw...so this wasn't just a bad day for the Philly sandwich but it's ALWAYS this bland!  Even the staff recognized it as a BAD SANDWICH!  I expected more from the Wynn.  The chef should be alerted immediately and he/she should either pull it off the menu or season that bitch!  *sigh*  I'm sorry but I hate it when good restaurants serve bad food...  If you want a burger or appetizers go here for a leisurely meal but the total bill comes out to almost the same price for the Wynn Buffet so if you want to experience a good meal at the Wynn hit up the buffet instead!  Check my Wynn Buffet review.",

Side comment, if you don't like Rachel Ray there is a funny article about her in today's SF Chronicle.  The fish and chips were good, my steak was cooked well, the slider sample was delish and the tuna flavorful and the banana split was tasty.  Didn't order it but the crab dip looks so good.  And sitting on the terrace is nice if a bit too sunny but hey it's Vegas...oh don't sit on the terrace if you don't like the fact that your waitstaff is glistening.",

I ordered the cuban pressed sandwich and that was perfectly crusty on the outside and toasty warm on the inside with just enough mustard. SO ordered the oriental wrap and that was done superbly. I loved the house made chips that came along with my sandwich along with the fried plantains coated with sugar and cinnamon. My friend H ordered the pasta with shrimp. Sauce was a bit on the bland side and they were a little stingy with shrimp. A ordered a burger and it was a great burger. Overall, this was an awesome 24 hour cafe, the only set back is the high price tag. Great food and presentation. :)",

I think I wasn't so much disappointed by the food, but moreso the service.  We were seated right away, but still had so many long waits for our server.  And sometime in the middle of the meal, our server disappeared and someone else showed up.  I realize that these things happen sometimes - but a heads up would have been nice so we could look for the right server.  I had a cheeseburger which was quite tasty but WAAAAY too big.  Some people might think that's a plus, but I had to take off one side of the bun just to manage.  I also think that the food is a tad pricey - but hey, it's Vegas.  The ambiance is great - there are huge windows overlooking the pool area.  If only I was there for breakfast - I would have loved to try their eggs benedict!",

It seemed like the perfect place for a tea party while you discuss books or classical music. On to the food.  Mushroom Burger: nothing to brag about. It was a 1/4 lb of angus beef on  onion foccacia bread, with jack cheese, mushrooms and the usual dressing. The burger was very tall so it was a little difficult to get a full bite.  Fries: These were so good. Thinly sliced and crunchy, a perfect side to a burger.  Lobster & Eggs Benedict: A little unconventional for breakfast, but it was so good. I had a bit of plate envy after sampling my cousins food. A unique combo of lobster, egg and hollandaise. Get this if you're there for breakfast  Orange Juice: Tasted like chilled minute maid and they charged 3.50! Ridiculous, they lose a start for ridiculous prices.",

A fabulous setting that gets even better if you choose to sit outside on the patio next to one of the pools.  It may be called a cafe, but it feels a lot more \"finer\" than that.  The service is top notch, and nothing you'd come to except from your 'around the corner' cafe.    Prices were very reasonable for what you got.  My omelet w/ the works was cooked perfectly and not only had a firm texture to it, but creamy as well.  Their home-potatoes were evenly cooked (no hard raw spots) and had a nice crisp bite to it.  I had some of my parties pancakes, french toast, and waffles as well.  Nothing really stood out w/ the basic fair, but they were just as good as some top notch breakfast joints back home (although the pancakes weren't as big as say...Stacks).  A wonderful venue that to my surprise was open 24/7!!!  Great food anytime in one of the finer resorts on the strip.  You really can't beat that.",

    "text": "This restaurant is gorgeous both inside and out. Staff and patrons were all dressed almost too clean for this Seattleite, but it was easy to shrug off because we were at the Wynn, after all. The friendly hostess was quick to greet us on a Tuesday around noon, promising to find us seats, but we were led outside after we spotted our friends.  We had a view of the pool and people were swimming, etc. while we were having brunch. I'll admit, it was a tad bit awkward. But who knows, we're probably the awkward ones brunching at their pool. Since we were outside, there were quite a few birds - mid-meal, one actually flew through the space between our table and the umbrella. I particularly appreciated the mist spraying out of the umbrellas, but the misting seemed to stop as our meal progressed and the heat intensified.  Onto food & drink! We ordered the Terrace Pointe Sunrise (sourish) & the Key Lime Pie Smoothie (sweetish). Both were on point and I'm very interested to try other drink items.  I was ecstatic that there was a Benedict trio on the menu - I didn't have to make a commitment to just one Benedict! On the side, we ordered both the skillet potatoes (very thick-cut potato chips) and hash browns (cube of shredded potato that was fried on top & bottom), which came out before the rest of our meal. Though the portions were sizable, neither potato sides were very crispy. I also can't say the classic or turkey-avo Benedicts were very memorable either. However, I would come back for the crab Benedict - I thought the crab cake was made perfectly and the combination of poached egg & spinach worked really well with it.",

Perhaps it's because it was Sunday around check-out time but I was happily surprised at the quietness of the patio.   My cousin had the eggs Benedict which she said were some of the best she's ever had. I enjoyed the croissant French toast and I've never had anything like it before. I'm not a big breakfast person and don't like eggs, so finding something so incredible was quite a find!   The service was good, a nice change since service at Wynn had been uncharacteristically poor that weekend. Our coffee was very extra hot which we loved and was well brewed.   The price was what I expected, not cheap, and was completely worth the price. I highly recommend this over any other breakfast establishment in the hotel.",

Shortly after I felt as if I were to vomit, I must have gotten food poisoning from it which is very surprising since it was 100% vegan. I hadn't eaten at all until then, so I knew it was definitely the stir fry! Unfortunately I had a horrible experience with this lovely cafe, so if you are planning on going here, don't order the Red Quinoa Stir Fry!!!",

The hostesses are very polite and hospitable.   We came here for breakfast, although I was told that this restaurant serves breakfast upon request all day.   Our server was extremely nice and we had everything we needed throughout our dining experience. We had a lovely view of the pool and enjoyed a breezy, sunny breakfast outside on the terrace.   We each got a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice. For a small juice glass, it is $7 each which I find absurd but when in Vegas...  I got huevos rancheros. The sauces served with the dish were both extremely flavorful and I really enjoyed them...especially the avocado cream sauce. They were much needed because the actual dish needed a bit more seasoning even if only salt and pepper. I am a person that rarely even cooks with salt and pepper and I NEVER add it at a restaurant so for me to add salt, it's saying a lot! My Mom got the Belgian waffle served with berries and she thoroughly enjoyed that dish as well.   They have an extensive vegetarian menu which is nice to see because most places have so few choices for vegetarians. Upon ordering, they also ask if you have any food allergies.   I highly recommend this restaurant for breakfast. The lunch menu looks delicious as well but we didn't have a chance to return for lunch during our stay. I've been here on several visits in the past and it never disappoints. I do miss their banana foster french toast. It is no longer on the menu and it was MUCH better than the version currently being served at Tableau.   Try it out...you won't be disappointed!",

After that, another 20 minutes before your food order is taken. Then another 45 minutes before you get your food. And in between, you rarely get your waiter/waitress asking how you are doing or tending to the table. In fact, you will get an attitude from the server if you ask them for anything. Not to mention having to sit next to dirty, i cleaned tables for 30 minutes after the diners have left. They don't bother checking in on you once the food arrives either.  The food is not bad. It's not fantastic. Just decent. So for being on the higher end of pricing, it's usually the service that justifies the high price. Don't expect that here. It's conveniently located by the pool at the Wynn so it's an easy option. Just not a good one.",

What drew us to Terrance Pointe was that it was low key and had a pretty decent menu with good variety.  With a choice to sit inside or outside with a view of the pool, the wait for our group was not that long, especially since the guys in our group didn't feel like wearing shirts with sleeves. The indoor dining room requires that guys have sleeves, if you don't, they will just sit you outside under one of the giant umbrellas on the patio.   There were 5 of us and we ordered various delicious breakfast/ brunch things like the Pulled Pork Eggs Benedict, Omelet with truffle, pancakes and the favorite, Steak and Eggs. My portion of (original) Eggs Benedict was so large, I was able to take some back to my room to enjoy later. Our waitress was really friendly and made great suggestions if we were in between choices. Overall, our brunch was pretty quiet because we were so busy chomping on our delicious meal. Needless to say, we all left feeling pretty satisfied!  It was a lovely and relaxing way to enjoy a nice brunch before preparing to rage on at EDC. Surprisingly the bill wasn't too expensive, especially for Wynn. I would love to come back and have another quiet and relaxing brunch on The Strip.",

I love their sunrise juice (healthy juice). The chicken noodle soup is surprisingly one of the best I've ever had. The chicken tenders are juicy and delicious. I always get something new when I dine here because the menu is grande! I've tried a variety of menu items, and most of them were good. I would stay away from the tuna poke salad (it's extremely salty) and the ham & cheese sandwich (comes with slabs of bacon, if you're a fan for greasy bacon- go for it!) There's even a vegetarian and vegan menu, you can't go wrong with Terrace Pointe, there's something here for everybody. Only complaint is that there's often a line, which moves really slowly, but luckily there's a VIP line (for casino card holders) so I don't need to wait :)",

    "text": "This restaurant sorely needs to re-evaluate their misogynistic dress code policies. I went to this restaurant with my husband on a Sunday morning. After checking their website for dress code and finding that it said only \"resort casual\", I dressed in high-waisted black jeans and a sleeved, crew-necked crop top. In all, I was showing 1.5 inches of midriff, no cleavage, and no legs. As we stood in line for 20 minutes waiting to be seated, my husband and I noted that the sign mentioned the dress code for women was \"opaque clothing.\" We laughed about the obscurity of this language, and I was certain that my clothing fit this standard. After being seated, the waitress then proceeded to shame me about my attire, saying \"We have a dress code here\" and offering me a shawl to cover the 1.5 inches of midriff that was showing. Meanwhile, as I looked around the restaurant I saw countless other women wearing arguably less modest clothing: exposed cleavage, backless dresses, and extremely short length. Additionally, they couldn't have possibly objected to my clothing on classiness grounds as they had no problem admitting the men standing in line in front of us--who were wearing basketball shorts and ball caps. Telling women how to clothe their bodies while having a completely ambiguous dress code is unacceptable. This restaurant needs to rethink their policies and join the 21st century before I will ever consider patronizing them.",

And while the menu states Breakfast 'til 11am, they'll serve breakfast on request all day, score!  French Toast Brioche with Cap'n Crunch crust - freaking loved this dish, and not as sweet as it sounds, which made it even better. You choose between Cap'n, Frosted Flakes, or Granola for the crust, but it's really lightly battered on. The brioche is so soft and there's a little fruit on top to mix-in.   Garden Frittata - the healthy nature of this egg white + lots of veggies omelet stood in stark contrast to the decadent French Toast. I think it could have used more flavor, required Tabasco sauce, so I'd probably opt for a different omelet next time.  The portions are manageable, but we ordered and split these two dishes, which was a good way to achieve a sweet and savory breakfast meal.",

We wanted to get brunch, but we didn't want to enter a food coma, so we decided to try out Terrace Pointe Cafe.  (We would have gone off the Strip if we had access to a car, but we didn't that weekend.)  THE SERVICE WAS AWFUL.  I had low expectations based on other reviews I've read here, but it didn't even meet that low bar.  Our waitress Heather was terrible, and the guy who took our drink order was nice at first but then totally ignored us.  Not only did we have to ask multiple times for bread, but we didn't get drink refills, and it took a LONG time to place our order and get our food.  The food took so long to come out that everything was lukewarm.  We would have sent it back, but we were starving by the time it finally showed up.  The craptastic service was made even worse by the fact that she was giving excellent service to a table of old white people behind us.  Mmm, brunch with a side of racism.  My favorite.  The bf was steaming mad by the time we got our check, and we only ended up tipping $1, on a check that was over $30 (speaking of which, the entrees are really expensive for what they are -- my turkey burger was $15!).  As for the food, the bf had the breakfast plate which came with pancakes and eggs and sausage links.  It also had toast, I think?  He said it was OK.  The turkey burger was decent but not that great.  Also, Diet Cokes are $4!!!  HIGHWAY ROBBERY.  Mr. Wynn, as a fellow Penn alum, I am disappointed.  Sorely.",

    "text": "A possible upcoming Vegas trip has this restaurant weighing heavily on my mind; it is my favorite spot to dine at right before leaving vegas to return home. Its a great place to go over the pictures on the camera, delete whats needs to be deleted, organize memories, and alibi's if need be and just have a good last couple of laughs over whatever vegas style adventures we've had on that particular visit.   We usually sit at the bar, have a couple of their excellent bloody mary's (they actually usually the spicy vodka, the only kind that belongs in bloody marys in my opinion) an order of the lobster benedict, and whatever else tickles our fancy on the menu. The lobster benedict is as rich and decadent as it sounds. Its not served on a soggy english muffin, instead its on a perfectly spiced crispy potato croquette, they are not at all stingy with the fresh lobster, and the asparagus is always crispy and perfect. The hollandaise is not to rich or eggy, or to heavily poured on, just enough to bind all the other tastes together. I usually order mine sans bacon (I just like to taste the lobster without all that smoky baconess) and fried eggs over easy instead of poached, because of personal preference. We've also ordered the salad with goat cheese beignets. The beignets are indulgent, crispy crunchy on the outside, smooth and creamy on the inside, the salad goes well with them as it cuts the richness. They also have a lobster and crab salad that I love; I always ask for rolls when we get it  because its not a green salad, but a mixed salad that is just begging to be eaten on roll drizzled with hot sauce. We've also tried a steak salad, that didnt dissapoint either. I've had the crab cakes here as well, but was not really impressed with them, it was the first time in my life I thought to myself I wish there was less crab in these cakes, they just lacked other flavor, I kept thinking \"I want to take these back to kitchen myself and season them up right\". One miss in a series of hits is not enough to make me say I dont love place, truly I do!   The service at the bar is always attentive, occasionally we are forced to take a table because of the size of our group or because the bar is full, dont be deterred by the line outside, they are quite efficient at getting people seated and fed, however you will never feel rushed to leave. If you sit outside you will have a view of the Wynn Pool, not the topless one, but I hear the view is still lovely!",

Very impressive their burger--\"I am eating. Don't bother me\" kind of good burger. med rare, sharp cheddar (my choice of cheese), lettuce, red onions, tomatos..perfection served with crispy brown fries. mayo and mustard are served on the side.  their chicken parmigiana--(evenly and thinly) breaded and (processed mozzarella) cheese-topped (thick dry) chicken breast topped with (so sorry and so blend) tomato sauce and served over (overcooked) pasta. \"I am sorry but you ordered this??!!\" kind of dish. Banana split--I know it sounds plain but OMG. i don't even know here to start. it's like totally amazing. Caramelized bananas served with a scoop of real creamy strawberry gelato, a scoop of dark chunky brownie chocolate ice cream, and a scoop of light French vanilla mix between ice-cream and gelato. it's huge so share with others (although you probably won't want to share once you have a bite of it).",

The ambience was very relaxing, and we got to enjoy the beautiful decor and scenery by the pool.  The food was very fresh and flavorful, and the portion was large.  I nearly died trying to finish my linguine with clams, and I'm a buffet kind of girl.   If you're eating dinner right before going out dancing, I suggest sharing with one other person.  The only downside our dinner was our waiter - he was a cheesy comedian wanna-be that dissappeared half the night.   Overall, this place had great food at great price and great ambience.  I'd totally come back.",

The setting here is casual but upscale at the same time, the main dining area is very bright and welcoming, just an awesome place to grab a bite and start your day in Las Vegas.  Now on to the food, this was my first visit to Terrace Pointe and the items ordered did not disappoint at all!  Had the opportunity to try their Vegetarian 'Chicken' & Waffles & their Croissant French toast.. both were AMAZING!!!  I am a huge lover of meat & their Vegetarian Chicken & waffles taste exactly like the real thing, down to the texture of how fried chicken would be. They have IMO perfected this dish!  The Croissant French toast was HUGE! Definitely can be ordered as a side & shared between 2-3 ppl.. Taste was absolutely mouth watering, the chef's ability to combine the crispiness and flakiness of the croissant paired with the sweetness of fruits and syrup was a home run.  Highly recommend these two dishes if you're pondering what to order.  Will definitely come back in the future to try the rest of the menu.",

I have never gone to Vegas and not come here at least two times...even if my trip is only for 24 hours... I choose to stay at the Wynn not only because it's the best hotel but because I have the best experience and food specifically at this restaurant. From my favorite, the yogurt and granola to the seasonal bbq chicken salad or any one of the eggs benedict, the food is outstanding.  Every single person that works there is not only nice and pleasant but funny and charismatic. When you come in you are greeted by the best hostesses and seated right away. Even when there's a line, it goes by super fast. Make sure to get the yogurt and granola, even just to try it. Also, this place isn't cheap but it's 100% worth it!",

We were seated fairly quickly and the waiter gave us plenty of time to look over the menu before he had greeted us.  Upon arriving to our table we already knew exactly what we wanted to order. A few minutes later I wanted to add another item to our order. Trying to get out waiter to come by was impossible. Then I asked someone else to grab him. He walked by me twice before approaching me... and when I say approaching, I had to stop him.  Once we received our food, all went well. The food was okay. We got a skillet, berry plate, and croissant French toast.  Eggs were over cooked in the skillet, the berrys were fresh and delicious, and the French toast would be great without the sauce they pour over it. I'm going to try to avoid this cafe moving forward.",

The waiters are all super polite and attentive. I got the carrot ginger tumeric juice (forget the exact name) and it was great. All the juices at the Wynn restaurants are really well made and smooth (no chunky bits!) but yes, a bit expensive (~$10). I came here for breakfast and had the smoked salmon which was super filling and delicious. I'd recommend sharing this because you'll be stuffed with all the good fish protein afterwards if you finish it. My boyfriend had the crab cake eggs benedict which was very good as well (as are the roasted potatoes that come with it!). Also, I don't know why but if you order coffee, they'll give you a massive pitcher for your own refills so if you don't want to waste, bring your own refillable mug or ask for an EMPTY to-go cup for the leftover coffee (we made the mistake of simply asking for a to-go cup for the coffee and ended up with a coffee-filled cup so that kind of backfired).",

Nothing special, it was all something you could get the same flavor and quality from drive thru and places like Denny's and IHOP. I was holding the pancake to high hopes because of the reviews, and it was just plain and thick and broke apart easily. We live in area where we get a lot of homemade mom and pop places claim to have the \"best\" and almost have better made and better quality pancakes than what we had today at the Wynn.

We came on a weekend at noon and were immediately seated. The service was par for the course for any Wynn restaurant: outstanding.   The vegan menu had plenty of options, but I was dead set on getting the chicken and waffles, which didn't disappoint. This breakfast meal costs around $20, but I think it's worth the splurge. The waffles came with vegan butter and the choice of a maple and spicy syrup. I didn't order any sides, but I left with a full stomach and a happy heart.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2017: #40",

The meal took forever though. They need to work on their service so the meal doesn't drag. Tables next to us just up and left because servers were taking far too long to come and take orders. It was their one downfall.",

    "text": "2.5 stars.    If not for the service this place would be closer to 3.5 stars. The food is decent here but the service was HORRIBLE.  Let me be clear, our servers were nice, they were just never around.  Everything took FOREVER.  From getting a table (this part I understand given the time on a weekend), to taking our order, to getting our order, to getting the check, to paying the check.  It was downright exhausting.    The food...We ordered everything from burgers to a Cobb salad to biscuits and gravy and French toast.  Like I said, it was all fine and tasty, but remember in Vegas (the strip) you're usually paying for style over substance.  Here, you're paying for the view and atmosphere so dont expect anything mind blowing from the eggs.    Would I go back?  Not unless i was staying at the hotel and feeling extremely lazy/unadventurous.  Otherwise, go on a food adventure and try something a little more exciting.  There are plenty of great food options  in town, this is one of those hotel cafes that benefits greatly from convenience.",

I felt the price was very high (I know it's vegas, but still, $20?!), and I have certainly had better chicken and waffles other places.  We also ordered the vegan sliders and those were quite tasty.  Overall it was very, very nice to have vegan options on the strip.  They have a full, separate vegan menu, which was super nice, but you'll definitely leave with your wallet much lighter given the prices.  I would go back again, but I wouldn't order the chicken and waffles again.  The restaurant has a great atmosphere and the staff was very nice.",

I've never seen a single thing out of place. Terrace Pointe Cafe is just the same; everything is extremely clean, organized and on point. Terrace Pointe has an outdoor patio that looks out to the pool. I'm always in very early before the patio opens so haven't had a chance to sit out there yet. First chance I get, I will have to get out there.   The food is fantastic. I've had both the waffles and the three egg breakfast with potatoes and a choice of meat. The orange juice is fresh squeezed, and a little small for seven dollars, but I get it, it's The Strip in Vegas and the prices are high. Excellent service, and a very pretty environment that appears to be French decor inspired.",

Waffle was delicious with a slight crisp accompanied by a soft fluffiness. The spicy syrup the came with was different and went well. Some reviewers are complaining of the price, but for a las vegas hotel I really did not think it was bad...something like $20 bucks.  I also tried the biscuits and gravy, bacon, eggs benedict. Nothing mind blowing about those, but all were really good. I'd also recommend the 21$ all u can drink mimosas, some of which I stole from my dad.  Service was great. View was beautiful as we faced the Wynn pool. No complaints at all.",

    "text": "Usually when I wait more than a month or two to review a restaurant, I usually just shelve that review until next time. I like the experience to be fresh in my head in order to properly rate it. With the Vegan brunch at Terrace Pointe, one only needs to try it once to know it's the most fabulous brunch you'll find in Vegas.  We wanted to splurge for a final meal in Vegas, and why wouldn't it be at Uncle Steve's Vegan-friendly paradise of The Wynn?  Sure $20 for Chicken and Waffles ain't no joke. Especially considering we have the best version of this back home in The East Bay Area at Hella Vegan Eats and Timeless Coffee, for much less. Thankfully they're not serving up tiny foo foo portions here. No, this is definite hangover food in size and taste. So much so that this was the only place in town that we needed a to go bag. The waffle was fantastic and I wish I knew how they got the coating so perfectly on the huge slab of Gardein.   The Strawberry French Toast was a bit cheaper, yet still pricey. This was my honey's order, yet I ended up eating more of it than she did. I'm usually more of a savory vs sweet breakfast eater, but if you are going the sweet route, you can't go wrong with this dish. The french toast was perfectly made in the \"I can't believe it's Vegan\" way. So light 'n fluffy, you would never know unless someone told you.  The reason my honey didn't have room for all of her French Toast was the Blackberry Tart. We ordered that since we knew we wouldn't be eating anywhere else that day. Not bad, as these Wynn folks know their pastries pretty well.   The homefries we got on the side were so so. They could've used more crisp to 'em. What I would not order is the side of Gardein sausage. Nothing special about it. In fact the two entrees were such good portions that this was overkill. Sure there are a few healthy Vegan entrees on the menu but you're not here for that. Just get the French Toast, Chicken, And Waffles, It's all you need to begin your day.   The carafe of coffee that the friendly waitress left at the table was a nice old school diner touch that I was not expecting from such a $$$ place. Their uniforms were also very old school and ill fitting. I'm not expecting cocktail waitress apparel, but c'mon Uncle Steve, help these ladies out here!  Sure, I could knock them on price. But you know what, it's Vegas. You don't come here because you're looking to save a few pennies. I would come here all over again, as it was probably my favorite meal in town. Especially ever since the closing of Pura Vida. Brunch is the most important meal of the day other than maybe beer. Then again, you need some food to soak up that booze and I can't think of anywhere else I would rather start my day, other than Terrace Pointe Cafe.  This HOT Stuff Spoiled me with a huge brunch spread: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/terrace-pointe-cafe-las-vegas-7?hrid=3WpHWwLGGF17WZx9emijNA\">yelp.com/biz/terrace-poi...</a>",

    "text": "If you are in Sin City and in need of a Vegan Brunch. Heck even if you're an omnivore, you'll love this place. As our last day in Vegas. We decided to splurge a little...retract a lot!! We headed to Terrace Pointe Cafe inside the Wynn or is it Encore. Heck I always get the two confused.  I think the first thing I noticed that needs to be changed is the hostess and waitresses outfits. C'mon Mr. Wynn what were you thinking when you put these beautiful ladies in \"1960 Airplane Stewardess\" outfits that are twice their size. It's like going into grandma's closet. No good!!  But on the good side, the decor of this place is quite soothing with a view of their outside pool and if you prefer to eat outside you can.  Now let's get to the food. If I can RECOMMEND anything, I would suggest the VEGAN CHICK'N and WAFFLES|$20. The added spiced maple syrup and scallions inside the waffle batter...sets them apart from any old chicken and waffle.  We also order the following...  VEGAN PAIN DE MIE FRENCH TOAST|$15...Holy heck why can't all restaurants serve this. They dip the toast in a banana soy milk, top with fresh strawberries and powdered sugar. It's like breakfast dessert, yuumm!!! I want it now. If you prefer sweet or savory breakfast order this!!  Side Order-Breakfast Potatoes|$4 and Gardein Breakfast Sausage|$4...I would suggest you pass on these sides. The potatoes were soggy rather than crispy. The sausage was good, nothing spectacular  Dessert-Organic Vegan Blackberry Tart|$8...was not a huge fan of this dessert, I'm not a huge fan of eating desserts that have seeds.  This was definitely the way to end our last morning in Vegas. I hope my honey had a great birthday getaway!!

We ate at Terrace Pointe 3 times this weekend and sat at the bar, outside, and inside for a little variety. The birds were a bit more aggressive this year, so if you are not a fan of birds everywhere then eat inside. The bar had super speedy food service and the staff was very friendly.   My husband had the regular chicken and waffles, huevos rancheros, and eggs benedict trio during our visits and recommended all options for meat eaters. But he always made room for some of my vegan chicken and waffles with his breakfast.   Vegan and vegetarian friends: do yourself a favor and order this if you visit Terrace Pointe Cafe.

Terrace Point is definitely not a place I'd recommend or suggest but my family seems to like this place. If you're looking for gussied up diner food, then do check this place out!  Traditional breakfast -- Two eggs (anyway you like it), your choice of meat, and hash browns. If I were to get this at Denny's, I would normally feel all groggy and heavy after. Terrace Point definitely reminded me that I was eating at the Wynn. Light, close to no greasy oil, and simple. It's a decent amount of food and you be able to share between two people, especially if you're hungover.  The service was a bit spotty the last time we went but it seemed like they were understaffed that morning, paired with a rush of the morning crowd. Not bad!",

Booo). Vegan Caesar salad is sooooo good!  Also, nonvegan, but the buttermilk pancakes are THE BEST IN THE WEST. Thick, fluffy, ufff. No other place is the same for pancake lovers. Take your beloved pancake lover here on a special day.  No stars off, but even the updated uniforms are unfortunate for these poor employees. Gag.  Also, please carry sweetened condensed milk as a topping for pancakes & such!",

    "text": "Vegas is all about opulence, and the Wynn seems to take his mission to heart.  The Terrace Pointe Cafe, with its fantastic sunlight views, extremely attentive service, and meticulously clean environments, made me instantly enamored with the restaurant.   If you're a fan of eggs benedict, you'll love this place.  They offer crab cake, pork belly, and classic eggs benedict, or a trio of all three with *no sides*, so it's all benedict, all the time.  My friends got the biscuits, which were similarly drowning in gravy (though she loved it), and my friend got the steak frites, which were pretty passable, though it cooked medium despite asking for medium rare (understandable on such a thin cut, though).    The main issue, I think, was just how *heavy* everything was.  Their hollandaise, while still tasty, is a crazy heavy, especially when paired with thick, salty bacon and/or fried crab cake.  Their bloody mary, at $16, was garnished with just a lemon and an olive, and even after I squeezed the entire damn lemon in, was still pulpy with tomato and salt.  A dash more lemon juice in both food and drink would have gone a long way :P    The service, and perhaps the unwillingness to wait in The Buffet line, are the main draws of this place.  Our servers were warm, attentive, and quickly brought us the check (as we were in a rush.)  Overall, I think there are better dining options, unless you want to be fawned over for an hour or two.  Then, I'd probably give this place another shot.  ---  sweet: great service bitter: heavy on the palate, a bit pricey.",

The seating was way comfortable and the service was great. Best of all was how affordable it was in the midst of Vegas, haha. I'd say about $15(+/- $3) an entree.  I got the mushroom/swiss burger with shoestring fries. The burger was bigger than my head. And it was topped with an cherry tomato and olive! But most importantly, it was juicy and tasty. Medium rare. Our table also ordered a burger but medium, and it turned out a bit too dry. So stick with medium rare. Two of my friends could not resist ordering the lobster benedict. When it came to our table, my friends had to fight us off from getting to it first! It smelled REALLY good. They licked the plate clean, and probably would've eaten that as well if they weren't so full from the meal on it. Definitely come here for casual food.",

It was crowded, but this is Wynn.  It's run like a machine.  I'm sure they realize that Saturdays are busier than Tuesdays or Wednesdays, so I would think they would have more employees working on weekends.  But, it took well over 20 minutes to get our food after ordering.  It took nearly 10 minutes just to get drinks.  So, bad start for sure.  My wife had French toast, which was dry.  Also, despite the plethora of sugary ingredients, it was somehow bland.  We would not repeat this.  So, how come I gave this place 3 stars?  The chicken and waffles.  It was fantastic.  First of all, it's a large breakfast; I didn't finish it.  Each order contains 2 large thin chicken cutlets fried.  They were very crispy, the chicken remained juicy and it was seasoned well.  It's the kind of chicken I wish I was able to make at home.  Practice I guess.  The chicken went well with the waffles.  It comes with maple syrup and spicy syrup.  I liked both, and both went well with the dish.    Overall, we would probably return, but during off hours.  The service at Society Cafe was better during a busy time.  I will definitely get the chicken and waffles again, but I doubt we get the French toast.",

It was a challenge narrowing down which restaurant to check out but I zeroed in on Terrace Pointe Cafe with the intention to get the Vegan Sliders. But when the hostess handed me the special vegan/vegetarian menu, I was like a kid in the candy store and couldn't make a decision. Thankfully the BF knows how to take charge as he ordered the Vegan Spinach and Artichoke Dip for our appetizer while buying me another 5 mins to decide on my entree.  The Vegan Spinach and Artichoke Dip is heaven! Pure savory, creamy, delicious heaven! The cashew cream gives it its creamy texture and awesomeness. Perfect for dipping pita chips. It's dishes like this that make me wonder why the \"normal\" version of this dip needs to contain dairy at all because this dip kicks ass! <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FYP3BkI&s=435d7416d00d1d4fb0ef8408d95da0af1559bebd9f321fa14fdb9eeba9bbe12c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/YP3BkI</a>  For my entree I decided to get the Vegan Chick'n and Waffles. Yeah, you heard me right...VEGAN Chick'n and Waffles. They used two pieces of Gardein chick'n breast which was fried crispy. The scallion waffle was savory. You get one large circular waffle cut into quarter pieces. Fluffy on the inside and lightly crisp on the outside. It came with a side of vegan butter. But the real topper of this dish was the spicy maple syrup. YUMMMMM!!! This dish was so good that even the meat eater BF (who ordered the Chipotle Steak Salad) was jealous of my meal and wish he ordered the same thing! <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F13BvQFe&s=5a5a309f839e9a9a3019e5e9dd9ce3348d4bd29c3f184956235b901e229c4fd4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/13BvQFe</a>  $20 for the plate of Vegan Chick'n and Waffles. Yes, it's friggin' expensive but it's friggin' delicious! I believe in having \"Treat Yo' Self\" moments. This is definitely one of them!  I really wish I had room for dessert though. They have a Vegan Banana Split Brownie dish calling out my name!",

Good thing it wasn't busier, then we might wait an hour for the wrong order.  They of course add 18% for parties of 6 or more so great!  I get to way overpay for the wrong food.

    "text": "Eating brunch by the pool at the Terrace Poine Cafe is one of my favorite things to do when in Vegas.  I have gone here a few times and each time the food has stayed consistently good. Of course there are a few dishes that are better than others but the main dishes are all pretty good.  In the few times I have been here, I have ordered the Benedict Trio, Crispy Fried Chicken & Waffles, Mimosas and Key Lime Smoothie.  Lets start with the drinks. The Key Lime Smoothie with Avacado in it is super creamy and smooth. This is probably one of my favorites from their menu. iirc it is one the server recommended to us. I have ordered this multiple visits and it is always consistent. If you do not like key lime, do not order it, that is another strong flavor you get when sipping.   Unlimited Sparkling Cocktails is a little bit on the expensive side, but then again, we are in vegas so nothing to be surprised about. They do not skimp you on the alcohol on these and they can definitely get you feeling tipsy. Each has a good flavor but if you would rather save some money than splurge, probably go for one of the Juice Bar menu items. Plus, you may need energy for those pool parties :)  Crispy Fried Chicken & Waffles, I am not much of a waffle fan besides taking instagram photos of them but I do get temped to order them when chicken is in the mix. The Crispy Fried Chicken is my favorite part of this dish. It is seasoned well and it is not dry. I hate eating dry chicken, especially if it is served at a restaurant. You will not be disappointed eating this if you like Chicken and Waffles on the regular. The only downside is the price.  Benedict Trio, this was a little disappointing because I was expecting much more from it. The flavor is okay but I would recommend other things on the menu over this one. If you are a sucker for Benedicts like me, then you probably will eventually end up ordering this. Maybe share it with a friend so you can try other things? It is only okay in my opinion, and \"only okay\" isn't really worth the price in my opinion.  For sides, we tried the Applewood Smoked Bacon, Hash Browns and Skillet Potatoes. Nothing I would recommend here, stick to the main dishes.",

The biscuit gravy skillet was decent but huge.  It tastes exactly the way you'd expect.  It's a safe choice.   The poke bowl was good.  I'd eat that again.  It was nice and fresh and had lots of components that worked well together.  I also got the immunity booster juice and the roots. I preferred the immunity booster over the roots.  If you like green juice than the immunity booster will do the trick.    I also appreciated how flexible they were with the menu, offering vegetarian options and being able to substitute items.",

Even though we stayed at the Paris hotel and it took us a while to get there. Let me just say, it was well worth it!  It was as picturesque as I remembered and very instagrammable. (I know that's the word that millenials measure brunch restaurants by, being one myself.) The hostess sat us by the pool, but I requested one of those comfy booths. She obliged. I was so glad I made that move because our booth was so roomy and changed the pace and comfort of our whole dining experience. Well that and our awesome waitress. She was so sweet and hospitable. When she found out that it was my birthday, she even brought a complimentary dessert for me at the end of our meal. Ok, backtrack a little to the actual meal. I had the croissant French toast. It was perfection! Not too sweet that you feel guilty about indulging in dessert for breakfast. The yogurt sauce went so well with it and heightened the overall taste. My husband's chicken and waffle was scrumptious. None of that dried up chicken on top of burnt waffle. It was so good!   I highly recommend this place for brunch. Needless to say, I'm already dreaming about our next trip here.",

They always have amazing service, and high quality food. This trip, we ordered their berry yogurt plate, I got the omelette, and my wife got eggs with toast and fruit. The atmosphere is amazing here. We always love to sit out on the balcony, overlooking the Wynn pool, it is magical! They never rush you, and are happy to help with any requests. Highly recommended!",

Supplement with three egg plate, which comes with potatoes, choice of bacon, sausage or ham, and toast.  Nothing special here, but the potatoes were so good.  And I'm not a potato person.

Unfortunately we failed to plan ahead properly and account for the two hour wait, and that led us to the Terrace Pointe Cafe.  Despite being called a cafe, the decor was very fancy(though the staff wasn't uptight).  Outside of a bit of a  wait while they setup a table for our group of 7, we all came out thinking that this was one of our most pleasurable dining experiences.  Everyone in our group was very satisfied with our food(though we all selected heavier non-cafe fare).  Each dish had excellent attention to detail, especially with garnish(for example the fish and chips came in fake newspaper with silly articles on them).  I personally had the salmon and the french onion soup, both of which were fantastic.  Our waitress(Jamie) deserves special mention.  She was very personable, quoted movies with us, and would add witty commentary at opportune moments(plus she put up with our occasionally rambunctious behavior).  She catered to our every need, from those that we requested(asking for faster pacing due to time constraints) and those that we didn't request(bringing out extra sticks of rock candy when one member of our party obsessing over them after seeing someone else get one with the coffee).",

Simple plain and perfectly done! My side of fruit was also perfect as it wasn't just melon like most places. Frest fruit is a good indicator of a place, I think.  My husband had some crepes that were delicious. However, I couldn't stop eating the oatmeal. It was too good. I never thought I'd say that about oatmeal.   Definately recommend it for a low(er) cost meal in a casual setting. Nothing pretentious here.",

Luckily, I found the Terrace Pointe my first night there.  It was late and I didn't want a whole meal so I ordered the potato chips. Yes, potato chips. But these are Wynn-style chips. Meaning, home made, covered with truffle oil and blue cheese. So wrong, and yet so right!  Some friends joined me the next night and I found myself craving those damn chips and talking them into going there for dinner (truly, if you're staying at the Wynn, why go anywhere outside of it?!). We split the chips and everyone else found them just as heavenly. I and two others in our party went for the grilled cheese and tomato soup. Yes, grilled cheese and tomato soup. This is one of my all-time favorite meals and to find an upscale version thrilled me. The soup was tasty, but the sandwich a little dry -- though dunking it in the soup remedied that little problem.  This is definitely a good place to go for a relatively reasonably-priced meal in the Wynn. It also has a wide variety of items on the menu, so it's a good crowd-pleaser.",

Rather than pile on the gluttony at the very nice buffet, I wanted something simple and easy, so I picked the Terrace Pointe Cafe.  The service there was nice, friendly and congenial and they were good at everything but serving the food.  I had the eggs benedict.  The dish was unremarkable.  The sauce was fine, the poached eggs were just alright, the muffin was burnt.  The potatoes seemed like they were designed by a chef trying hard to deliver something nice, but again they were unremarkable.  I would rank the good ol' Grand Slam breakfast on a par with what I got at the Terrace Pointe and if you're in the Wynn Hotel, that ain't good enough.",

However I had won 8 dollars after most of the night battling slot machines and alcoholism all up and down the strip and felt like treating myself to a nice breakfast, instead of my usual casino floor free coffee and menthol cigarettes.  Although immediately after sitting down I felt underdressed, even though this is the casual restaurant on the property.  When I saw the size, material, and absolute whiteness of the napkin (serviette?) I realized just how out of place I was.  Oh well, \"Chicken and Waffles my good sir!\" I think I also ordered a smoothie that wasn't very good and way expensive.  The chicken and waffles were excellent even though not made in the gut bomb super greasy diner style that I am used to (They had some fancy sweet sauce type stuff for it).  Good portion size and presented in a very loving way that only corporate luxury can deliver. The restaurant faces the pool and has outdoor seating (in the summer in LV, are you crazy?!?) so it has some good people watching opportunities. Not high on my list of places to return to, given that if I am in Wynn ever again it will be because I am actually a baller instead of what I was last time which was lost, drunk, and just a tad curious.",

But, we decided to try it anyway and sit outside next to the pool (close to the pool) since it was a nice day out. First off, the line was ridiculous, I'd say over 15 minutes, when clearly there were empty tables all around the restaurant. Grand Lux- 0-1 minute wait. We sat outside and the patio was a nice setting. However, the umbrellas which provided the shade had a lot of bird poop and although we wouldn't have minded the cute small birds, there were these hideous pigeons that were also flying around. But the main thing was the smoking. Apparently there was this couple sitting at an adjacent table smoking next to us. We had three small children. We asked if we could move. The hostess informed us that the entire outdoor patio allowed for smoking and if we didn't want to be around smokers that they could find us a table indoors. I was disappointed to know that they didn't even have a smoking section and a non-smoking section for the outdoor patio, which apparently they need because some people in the world have no regard, respect, or consideration, even for kids. If you want to kill yourself, don't kill other people while doing it. Smoking is a sick disease and smokers are addicts and are just compelled to behave in such a destructive way, its pathetic. Why would someone want to smoke a cig for breakfast is beyond me. You'd figure people at a high class place like the Wynn would be different. Guess not. This one is on Wynn for making the rules. Apparently rules are made for those who just don't know better. Since there are no rules here, we won't be returning. The service was good and the food was ok. Its not that hard to mess up scrambled eggs and toast or even chicken and waffles. Not gonna jeopardize my health or my kids because of some idiots and especially because a top hotel doesn't have rules to control their patron's behavior. There are better places to eat, e.g. at the Palazzo or the food court at the Fashion Show, or Chinatown up the street.",

Thirty minutes later, as nothing else had arrived and my girlfriend was hungry, we asked if the bread basket we had ordered with our food could be brought right away. Ten minutes after that request, still nothing had arrived. My girlfriend got up and asked for the manager. When we complained, about 2 minutes later the bread arrived and about a minute or two later the food arrived but completely cold. We figured that the food had been sitting back there for some time before delivery and only our complaint had motivated them to actually look for our food and bring to our table. We sent the food back and left. A waste of 45 minutes. The place was not that busy either. We were disgusted with the service.",

    "text": "I have been here twice, both times for breakfast, and ordered the same thing. I had poached eggs, with sausage, potatoes and wheat toast. The overall feeling is \"eh\". I've had much better poached eggs (for example, at the Original Pancake House), the potatoes tasted like they'd tried to \"make 'em all fancy\" but failed. The sausage was pretty poor, but perhaps that's because I was expecting more of a \"breakfast sausage\" than standard mini-sausages. The service was nothing to brag about - they did the job but that's about it. I wouldn't have gone twice (or, let's be honest, probably be going again tomorrow morning) except that I'm at a conference at the Wynn and it's right downstairs. Might be better if you have something else, though my colleague really wasn't thrilled with his poached salmon breakfast dish either.",

    "text": "\"What does Steve get?\"  While dining at Red 8 (another Wynn establishment), a server told us that if you ask this question at any restaurant at the Wynn, they will tell you what Mr. Wynn's favorite menu selections are. Or, at least what the vegan options are (he happens to be vegan).  Our server didn't know.  No matter. All of the restaurants at the Wynn have separate vegetarian menus, and that's what we ordered from. I couldn't resist the chicken and waffles and my wife had to go for the famous $9 burger, fries, and shake deal.  While we waited, we took in the atmosphere. It was way too hot to eat on the patio, but that seems to be the main attraction.  Even if you're an omnivore like me, I recommend checking out the vegetarian menu. I had never seen vegan \"chick'n\" and waffles before, and other diners near us were fascinated when our orders were brought out. Also, the chicken and waffles were damned good. This is an example of mock meat that could possibly fool someone. The scallion waffles came with regular as well as spicy syrup, and vegan \"butter\" (Earth Balance?) My wife's cheeseburger was a Gardein burger with Daiya cheese, ketchup, mustard, and pickles designed to replicate similar fare from the Golden Arches, and it came pretty close. The only flaw, strangely, was the bun, which didn't quite have the proper look and taste. I still liked it. The fries were probably made without all of the 17 ingredients that go into Mickey D's fries:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnutrition.mcdonalds.com%2Fgetnutrition%2Fingredientslist.pdf&s=a740a53328c6c867fb8d1f0358c3fb57608d20f5859007d805a59f8f9e47fec8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">nutrition.mcdonalds.com/...</a>  The non-dairy chocolate shake was quite tasty too. All told, not a bad deal for $9. It's worth a try, but I don't know the value offset that of my $20 meal.  The Wynn probably has better options whether or not you eat meat, but we definitely enjoyed our meals, and we are really glad that they can accommodate special diets, including gluten-free.  Thanks, Steve!",

Get a table outside and enjoy the views of the pool while soaking a bit of sun.   Ordered the Chicken & Waffles last time and it was pretty good.  You can get it with a sunny side egg on top and it comes with their spicy maple syrup.  Also the corn flakes french toasts are pretty damn good too.    Wynn and most of their restaurants including this one offer great vegan options and this place has their own unique menu for lots of vegetarian and vegan selection, some that even mimic normal menu items like Chicken and Waffle.   Just watch out for the pigeons that may land in or near your head while you're feating, True story!",

There were a group of \"fancy\" women at the table next to us who could not stop complaining about the tiny little birds. Ummm, you're outside. Birds live outside. What do you expect? They were just looking for something to complain about.  It was a warm day in Vegas, but that wasn't a problem. The umbrellas have misters built in, so on those especially hot days, you can stay cool (see pic: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=tANhxxLlzOrvzdXnO1c4cw&userid=7lsk7VJ4OvaTxtdcNeSjZg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>)   FOOD: I'm a fan of Eggs Benedict,so I ordered the Benedict Trio (see pic: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=4frRHBqrT68dh0TvpieKSQ&userid=7lsk7VJ4OvaTxtdcNeSjZg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>). It was very good and not too much food. I would order it again for sure. The prices were a bit high, but it's Vegas. Didn't seem too over the top to me.  SERVICE: Decent but it needed some improvement. There were a few times that I needed my coffee or water refilled and it took awhile. In fact, it took awhile to get my coffee in the first place, so I need to dock another half star.  Would I come back here? Definitely. It's a chill spot to have a relaxing brunch. Great people watching with the pool right there and the little birds trying to scavenge any crumb that might fall. Just make sure they bring my coffee next time!",

So, so good, with uber fresh ingredients, like celery, fresh peas, lettuce, bright and flavorful!!! There was chicken, and some fresh herbs, and at least 4 other ingredients. loved the light dressing as well. Fresh taco-like shell that has the texture of Chinese shrimp chips, with sesame seeds embedded in it. Salad was about $16  Disappointing was a $4 cup of nasty, non crispy, flabby fries that accompanied a French size grilled Mahi Mahi sandwich in chipotle sauce. Good, but def not worth $17.  Hey, it's Vegas, y'know?  Get that salad. AMAZING AMAZING Set along the side of the Wynn pool.",

    "text": "We had a very bad experience at Terrace Pointe Cafe during breakfast. Grackle birds were constantly dive bombing customers and the food! The staff seemed to just be used to working around them and ignoring them. Two girls sitting near us asked to be moved inside after one flew down, sat on the back of my chair, and began chirping loudly. Another guy took several pics on his phone of four birds picking at the dishes of a vacated table next to him. My husband was salting his newly arrived omelet when a grackle swooped in and took a bite off his plate! DISGUSTING. The staff didn't seem to notice. At first, my husband decided to just let it go - he cut away the half of the omelet that the bird had attacked and put it on my coffee saucer, then continued his meal. The bird later returned for food and knocked the saucer off the table, shattering it. It was then that we got up to complain.   We received a half-hearted apology from the manager and my husband's plate was taken off our bill. The manager seemed indifferent to the situation, saying that grackles are a protected species in Nevada and the hotel is working on an environmental solution, whatever that means. I would suggest that the Wynn hire a full-time bird minder in the meantime.   I do not understand how this is not a health code violation. Other reviews list this as an ongoing issue dating as far back as 2010. It was disgusting and completely unacceptable to see dozens of birds hopping around on serving trays, digging under napkins into abandoned bread baskets, and generally just being nuisances to all of us tryjng to enjoy our $21 breakfast plates and get out as soon as possible.",

Garden Vegetable Omelet - My Honey loved it!                  Coffee and Orange Juice - both were excellent!  The service and the food were great!  We had lunch inside and it was beautifully decorated.  We were lucky that there was a table available for breakfast outside by the pools.  It was beautiful and the weather was perfect.  Special Note for VEGANS:  Steve Wynn has become a Vegan and his restaurants now offer a Vegan menu.  The few things we tried were delicious!  Looking forward to coming back!",

    "text": "For a more detailed review, please refer to my original review that I posted last June. I wanted to update my experience, as I visited again in April 2018. We came back to Vegas for a friend's wedding and were only in town for two days. Rather than take a chance and trying brunch somewhere else, we decided to journey back to our favorite, the Terrace Pointe Cafe at the Wynn. Coming here is such a treat. The Wynn is absolutely stunning and it's a lot of fun just walking through and seeing all of the shops and restaurants, as well as the hard to miss gambling sections. The Terrace Pointe Cafe sits right along the pool, so you can choose to dine inside or outside. Given that it was nearly 100 degrees, we chose the inside option. Service here was excellent, as it was when we had visited previously. I tried the Sunrise Juice to start, which was carrots, orange and strawberry juice. It was super tasty and really refreshing. Brendan and I ordered the same exact meals we did the last time we visited- he went with the Eggs Benedict (with hash browns this time) and I went with the Vegan Chicken and Waffles. Ordering vegetarian/ vegan here is extremely easy here, as they have a complete menu dedicated to these options. The cost of the vegan version of chicken & waffles is the exact same as the regular chicken & waffles, which I love. Again, the food was extraordinary. We had a wonderful experience and will return here again when we visit Las Vegas again!",

We were seated outside...because the gentleman was wearing shorts.  I mean, Vegas, in August...shorts are pretty much standard.  But they will only let you sit outside unless you're wearing a tuxedo.  Or maybe just long pants.  Anyways, it was fine, view of the pool, and all the creepy-ass-birds, like from Edgar Allen Poe's \"The Raven\" staring you down.  Or literally drinking water out of the water pitcher that the busboys fill up the guests water glasses with.  We saw.  We gave the heads up that the birds had been drinking from it.  I hope they changed the water.  I had a RAD meal.  First we got the Truffle Fries, which were doused in this amazing, creamy, decadent savory truffle sauce.  Not like most places where they just sprinkle some truffle oil on the fries and toss some parmesan on top.  This was amazing.  Like gain 5lbs by looking at it, amazing.  I got the Shrimp Crab and Lobster Club sandwich.  Again, off the charts.  I was stuffed, I could only eat one of the 4 pieces.  But thankfully we left Vegas at like 12:30, the worst time ever to leave, and got back to Oceanside 9 hours later.  Epic timing on our part.  So I had the rest of it in the car later.  It was still amazing then.  I got the green salad with the vinaigrette.  Good, not earth shattering but good.  The fool that wore SHORTS to brunch in August, in Vegas...he got the TPC Burger.  It will light a fire inside your soul.    I got the endless champagne package, with Bellinis.  Our server was super attentive and made sure I had enough booze.  She checked if we had any food allergies, and was very all-around great.    I took away a star for the damn birds.  They're super irritating, there's bird shit here and there, they eat scraps, they drink the water from the pitcher your water might be from, they are fucking LOUD too.    We'd go back if we stay at the Wynn again.  Food was excellent.  Endless Champagne is always welcome in my body.",

We sat outside and even in the NEVADA heat we were kept relatively cool with their plentiful umbrellas and misting system :)  Two complaints, however... 1. The waitress was busy and not very attentive. She charged us for an extra seltzer (a whopping $5 for carbonated water) which we didn't order but (after a long time waiting for her to attend to us) she was able to take off the charge no questions asked!  #2. Patio was great, BUT there were birds everywhereeeee. Not really the cafes fault, but if you hate birds you will not enjoy yourself on their patio.",

I ordered chicken and waffles, and the fried chicken was very crispy and it was a pretty big portion. My friend and her son were also happy with what they ordered.  We had mimosas as well and the waitress made sure our drinks were full.   As with most Wynn and the strip hotel restaurants, the price is expensive, especially for some of the things on the menu like burgers or spaghetti, and the price of a fruit plate.  I like the fact that this restaurant have a separate vegetarian menu - besides the regular menu with vegetarian options. They also have all you can drink Champagne / Mimosas which is a bargain if you plan to have more than 2 drinks.     I read several reviews of how good the pancakes were and would like to come back.",

    "text": "I'd heard about the wonderful vegan options available at all Wynn restaurants due to the owner being vegan. A lot of the options are similar across restaurants, and I ended up going to Terrace Pointe Cafe because it had the option I wanted and had a cute, casual atmosphere.  The food option I wanted: The Wynn \"Burger\" with Cheese. It's described as a gardein burger patty, American cheese (vegan, of course), ketcup, mustard, pickles, onion, thin cut fries, and a chocolate shake. Yes, it comes with the shake! That's honestly the main reason I wanted it...I'd been craving sweet things and there aren't many sweet things for vegans in Vegas.   Anyway, I got my burger w/o ketchup, mustard, pickles, or onions because I'm lame like that; I asked for lettuce instead and they accommodated.  The food tasted good! I liked everything a lot except the bun was a bit lackluster - I think they could improve the bun a lot. The fries were amazing, though, so I think that makes up for it. The chocolate shake was good - it was made with almond milk in place of regular milk, I believe.  The menu says \"Vegetarian Menu\", but the waitress assured me that everything there is vegan.  Part of the reason I chose the food option I did was because of the price: $11 for a burger, fries, and a shake! I could see $11 w/o a shake being normal, and was impressed that the shake was included.   I'm excited to go back to Terrace Pointe Cafe and visit other Wynn restaurants someday to try out all the vegan options they have!",

The steak and eggs were satisfactory but you can find better and cheaper food elsewhere, especially in Vegas.   However, this is a fine place to enjoy the weather and summer atmosphere of a poolside meal if you're looking to catch a few drinks and spend some time with friends or family. You definitely feel as if you are at a resort and you almost don't mind paying extra for the privilege.",

The place wasn't terribly busy, but it took forever to get menus, forever to place our order, forever to get our food, and then forever to get the check (we actually never did get the check - we ended up just leaving enough money on the table).      The waitress was rude, and acted like our requests for bread were unreasonable.  I realize its not her fault that it took close to an hour for the food to come out, but its also not crazy of us for wanting multiple bread baskets while we wait.   We were by far the youngest people in the place (we're in our early 20s...actually I guess I should say \"mid-20s\"...yikes!), were dressed fairly casually, and ordered relatively cheap things, and she gave us the distinct impression that we were too poor for her classy, classy establishment.    We stiffed her - one of the few times in my life I've ever done that, but the service was beyond terrible.  The food was not terrible, but not particularly good either.  I had a Belgian waffle and my boyfriend had some kind of burger.  They were both edible but completely unmemorable.   Also, thanks to the atrocious service they were cold by the time they reached us.  There are so many other wonderful restaurants in Vegas -- go elsewhere!",

It was eating a chicken sandwich with extra bread. It was very filling. They could have done it with one less coating. The sauce was way too tangy. The kind of tanginess that makes you cough if you were to breath in the scent of the sauce upon eating it.   The Asian Chicken salad was a joke. The chicken was dry and the cabbage and dressing was bad.   The mushroom chess burger that my friend had looked good. Then again how can you really screw up a burger? This place would only be good if you were drunk out of your mind and you were starving. If you were to come here without these conditions then i don't recommend that you come here. It's hard to believe that a 5 star hotel like the Wynn have such a bad cafe. Extra star for the view of the pool view and the service.",

    "text": "You know, when I am dining at a 5 star hotel, forgive me... but I am expecting to be impressed and pampered.  Not here.  This place was horrid.    Lets begin with the 2 airheaded hostesses who stood there for 5 minutes and talked to each other while we waited to be seated.  Ok, I understand that they've got a whole complicated system going of how to seat people, but they at least could have told us how long it was going to be rather than ignoring us.  The real trouble began when we finally sat at our table.  10 minutes after we had decided what we were ordering and closed our menus to give the signal, I had to flag down one of the bussers to notify whoever our server was so we could order.   Well, he must have forgotton because it took another 5 for our waitress to come.  The restaurant was not busy at this time (3:30pm), mind you.  Yes, we hadn't even been greeted yet.  We didn't even have water.  Again people: a FIVE star hotel we're talking about here.  After ordering, we had to ask for bread 3 times...we had to send one soup back because it was the wrong one...just to send the correct soup back because it tasted so poor...they forgot my friends mojito...and I had to get up and walk to another table to steal some extra silverware because I couldn't flag down anyone who worked there.  Our busser, John, was the only one who seemed to have it together, but he was really busy holding the place down since everyone else wasn't helping.  In the end, we actually asked John if he could send a manager over so we could complain because our experience was so bad, and she ended up comping the entire meal after hearing about all of the inconsistencies and disappointments.  I would feel guilty about this at an independent restaurant, but c'mon.  This is the WYNN we're talking about!  They should have every aspect of the way they run their ANYTHING down to an art by now.  No excuse.  And, this was a TREND at the Wynn.  Very disappointed with the Wynn's service...not just here but also at Okada and Red as well.  Even the convenience store's service was whack!  The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because that bloody mary came in clutch, and my french fries were good.",

    "text": "We were in between breakfast and lunch so we ordered French onion soup, lobster benedict, and waffles with fresn strawberries.  Atmosphere was lovely. Service was good. Food was so so.  The French onion soup had way too much bread which basically soaked up the soup and left us with an entire crock pot of mush.  The cheese was melted perfectly on top and was deliciously savory but did not make up for the pile of mush beneath it.  The eggs benedict was pretty good, but it certainly wasn't the best we had tasted.  They were trying to be creative by serving a mini waffle under the poached egg insted of an English muffin, but the mini waffle did not have a good bite to it like an English muffin would have thus there wasn't a great contrast of texture with the egg.    The lobster was cut into small pieces and sprinkled around the plate.  There was also bacon cut into small pieces too and sprinkled around the plate.  The saltiness of the bacon and the lobster surprisingly went well together and did not clash.  I wonder if it would have been better without the bacon, as the lobster flavor would really sand out.  Perhaps, adding some sliced avocado in place of bacon might be a good flavor pairing although typical.    The waffles were crispy and yum. We asked if we could have both the whip cream and butter on the side, but they brought it with the whip cream on top and the butter on the side...it's like...HELLO...what part of BOTH do you not get?  Anyway, our waitress was attentive and the hostesses were very nice.  Although I might have preferred going to the buffet for breakfast for around the same price as my eggs benedict!!!    But the line is 2-3x longer!!  In Vegas, if you're NOT a VIP, be prepared to wait in line!",

When we first arrived in Vegas I was so starving I was tempted to gnaw at my arm. We found Terrace Pointe Cafe and I ordered a turkey burger which if it weren't for my hunger, I probably wouldn't have eaten much of; it was so dry!! The service was horrible. I had to ask for water at least 3 times, they served us warm beer and were inattentive for most of our stay.   The second experience was much MUCH better. We sat outside next to the pool, which, if you're going to eat here, it's a must to sit outside. The weather was beautiful while we were there so it was a real treat to enjoy a lovely meal in the sun. I ordered the BBQ chicken salad and it was one of the best salads I've had in a long time. It was fresh, full of yummy stuff like avocado, corn relish and black beans. It was topped with BBQ chicken and a chipotle ranch dressing. Man, I wish they had that exact same salad here in SF.   Bottom line is, if you're staying at the Wynn, come here and order the BBQ Chicken Salad. If you're not staying at the Wynn, I'd probably leave this one be.   The second",

The reviews I'd read before departure did not lie - this is a tasteful casino; the vegan food is outstanding, and all the staff enthusiastically promote it.  I liked it so much I decided to stop back at the Wynn/Encore complex for a night (and two more meals) on the way back home at the end of my vacation.

    "text": "Located just past the Wynn Buffet, the Terrace Pointe Cafe offers up a modern take on classic American dishes. With entrees in the $10-25 range, it's a welcome alternative to higher priced dining options but still manages to keep some of the upscale charm that you'd expect from the Wynn brand.  You'll be given the choice of indoor or outdoor seating upon arrival. The outdoor seating overlooks the beautifully laid out Wynn pools. There's a lengthier wait time for outdoor seating, but you'll enjoy the laid back vibe of the pool scene. You'll take advantage of the shade of the patio umbrellas -- so as to not toast yourself under the bright Vegas sun -- while sipping on a mid-day pitcher of sangria.  The, usually immediate, indoor seating isn't a total wash, you'll still be able to most likely enjoy the pool scene through the floor to ceiling windows; that is, if you're able to successfully fight off the rest of your party to grab the pool-facing seats.  As you'd expect, the service is top-notch. When a nearby diner asked their server if they knew if there was going to be a UFC fight that particular weekend, she quickly excused herself and informed the hostess of the inquiry. The hostess walked over to their table two minutes later and was able to confirm the details of the match up that weekend, which she gathered from a quick call to the concierge desk.   Good food, a great view, and service that is willing to go the extra mile for their guests -- always a five star experience in my book.",

Normally I would not spend $50 for a breakfast for two, but you are in Vegas pretending to be wealthy and staying in a hotel room with 10 foot high ceilings and more square footage then most apartments in LA.  Yes it is a little pricey but the quality did not disappoint.  The Lobster Eggs Benedict is now $20 and one of the eggs was runny like it should be and the other was solid, but the lobster was perfectly cooked and fresh.  I even got upsold a $7 strawberry smoothie that was damn good and I did not even mind.  Service was attentive, view was great, and free wifi make this place worth a stop.",

Get here early and choose a pool view on the terrace, it's very tranquil, at least before people start showing up with their noisy kids that have no place in Vegas, but don't get me started on that. Eggs Benedict is good, not great as the \"Canadian Bacon\" is more like ham, and dry. They have a couple of other options of Benedict's, but I didn't try them. If you're not in the mood to gorge yourself on way more food than you need at the Wynn Buffet, this is a great, and more scenic option. Now, time to leave, as someone's 2 year old is now screaming....aaaah there goes my serenity.",

He made our dining experience so much fun. Our busboy named Francisco (Pancho) was on top of it all. We never had to ask for refills. They were both so attentive.

Me and sis had a burger each and our mom had the waffle with strawberries. Everything was okay...I remember being super hungry so the burger went down and I don't even remember how it tasted.  I see how everyone is liking the Vegetarian Chicken and waffles... If I ever go again...I might try this. Lobster Benedict...I believe was $$$$. I love Egg Benedict but I'm not much of a lobster person. So spending $$$$ wouldn't make much sense to me.  My mom did love her coffee...I believe they give you a whole jug of it... And ofcourse my mom finished it. lol  Spending $50 + tax and tip  for 3 is decent. I would much rather go to Bouchon (A bridge over to Venezia) and spend a little more and get awesome food. But then again...I would have to wait an hour.  1 star for immediate seating and edible food. 1 star for having something my mom can eat.",

    "text": "This place is full of shit. A group of 5 including myself came around 11am to grab some lunch since our arrival in vegas. The venue itself is quite pretty but it was ridiculously crowded and there was a line where we waited about 30 minutes first, and then another 20 to be seated outdoors. When we were given a choice to be seated immediately indoors we decided to wait and have a couple mimosas at the bar.   Peggy at the bar around Jan 18th Saturday noonish was a horribly unprofessional and sullen bartender. She first off messed up an order and brought over an extra mimosa which I didn't argue with and just paid for despite her just apparently ordering drinks for customers. When I gave her my credit card to charge, It went through and I signed, and then about 5 minutes later she comes back to me and asks for my card back so she can swipe it again. I asked why since I've already got the receipt, gave her her tip and signed for the previous transaction. She gave me this bullshit murmur of an excuse and said it didn't go through blabhlah and aggressively took it from me and swiped again, I asked for the receipt again since I didn't keep the first one and checked with her I wouldn't be charged again. It's been over a week since she's run my card twice on one drink and both charges are up on my credit card. Also, the mimosa was seriously less than mediocre, gave me a headache with whatever cheap champagne and concentrate orange juice they've used, and it was $10 each. It's fine though, worth it to pay $20 for a shitty mimosa so I can learn my lesson to never ever come back here again and discourage others from having a shit experience.   Aside from this issue, this place ridiculously overpriced their low quality food items. I ordered a $16 truffle omelette, and it was a sloppy, greasy mess, an omelette from Denny's or IHOP would have been better and half the price. My bf ordered the truffle burger which was $18 and that was also a mediocre burger, not even worth mentioning or recommending to others. Our friends also ordered other items and the one who ordered the vegetarian burger that was really cheap and came with fries and a chocolate milk shake really got crappy food. Like, the burger was lower in quality than one from Mcdonalds or Burger King. I shit you not, they used like worse bread than they use at a horrible fast food chain which is just unbelievable.  The service was also just meh, as our server was extremely busy and pretty inattentive. It took FOREVER to pay for our meal because she wouldn't come back to return the credit cards.   The terrace was right by the pool and that was ok, they have some really loud imported birds and they are forward as fuck. Watch for them swooping in your face to grab food off your fork. They were also extremely loud and high pitched to the point of being distracting and annoying. They cafe also failed with the shading issue, my bf and I had a sunburn from eating lunch, because they took forever with every step of the process and secondly due to insufficient umbrellas up near the tables. I would go anywhere else but this place.",

The pancakes are delicious, order extra crispy hash browns with your breakfast but don't expect them to get your eggs the way you want, they seem to always mess up egg orders! Also a nice pick me up after a long night are there fresh squeezed juices. Atmosphere is cool, you can eat outside with a pool view or inside on large couch seats.

If you get the salad, there is no need to add meat, because honestly they dont give you that much for the extra price and the salad itself is savory.

Definitely would order these again! There were freshly made a d had truffle sauce and cheese over it. So bad for you but ooooo so good.

I casually mentioned it and the waitress was hugely apologetic and offered to bring whatever we wanted- because they addressed it and the breakfast is spectacular- 5stars is my rating :).",

I was eating breaking the other morning on the patio at the Terrace Point, outside with a nice view of the pool. We got out there at 9:15, as soon as they opened the outdoor seating (which seems a little late for a breakfast place).  Anyway, the meal and the staff was fine, and this place was a solid four stars right until as we were finishing up and all the tables we filling, everyone outside was set upon by more and more BIRDS. First pigeons, then grackles, then all sorts of birds. This must be their breakfast buffet, because they were arriving in waves! They got so bold as to land on the table of people eating, and peck at their food! A couple of tables stood up and left. So we paid up and left, seeing as we actually had finished our meal, As a parting gift, the birds pooped on our table twice, and hit a lady sitting across from us on her arm. Very unappetizing. I hope they get it under control. Until then, stick to the breakfast buffet across the aisle from this place. It is indoors, and safe from the Hitchcock movie reenactment.",

I wanted breakfast, eggs and meat, and what I got was simply delicious. The Pulled Pork Benedict was super flavorful, and it came served on jalapeno cornbread with BBQ hollandaise.  I am so happy about this!  My friend got the corned beef hash, and it was delicious as well. I'm also excited about the chicken and waffles they have on the menu, maybe next time I am in town I'll give it a whirl.  Best part: Compared to the other restaurants the prices are more reasonable and in a lot of ways the food is even better.  Left me feeling satisified!  They also have a nice Terrace (go figure) which may be worth the wait next time I visit.",

Terrace Pointe Cafe, just a few steps beyond the Buffet offers a good variety of breakfast, lunch and dinner entrees and sits quite comfortably in that lonely, yet elusive space between Wynn's numerous high-end fine dining choices and their buffet.  For the most part, the menu contains standard cafe items with a Wynn flare, i.e. the decadent lobster benedicts and kobe beef sliders.  I thoroughly enjoyed my spaghetti bolognase at 11:00am on a Sunday morning, so I give them props for that.  Bottomline: this cafe has a friendly, very attentive staff and the food is comprable to the cafes you'll find at Bellagio, Paris or Venetian hotels.",

They were one of my absolute favorite restaurants in the Wynn, which may seem surprising considering the Wynn offers endless options in the way of 5-star dining. But I'm not a 5-star dining kinda girl. I loved Terrace Point's poolside deck, friendly service, and fresh, delicious food options.  If I could have had my way with Terrace Point's menu, I would have. But I was trying not to cheat on my low-carb diet TOO much, so I opted for the dungeness crab benedict. It tasted better than it sounds. Amaze! Their homemade English muffin was topped with finely shredded potato, giant chunks of crab and topped with swiss cheese and hollandaise. I was in heaven.  I even cheated a little and got an apple walnut muffin, which was so gigantic I took it home on the plane with me.  My husband was so excited that they had fried chicken and waffles. They even have a spicy maple syrup for it, if you're feeling adventurous :)   And our server was kind enough to speed up service so that we could catch our flight, although I was so sad to leave. If only I had time to spare, I would have sipped my iced tea on the poolside deck for hours. But sadly, I had a flight to catch. Next time, Terrace Pointe!",

I think it should have been better and memorable given the price point.  So, I would say 3.5 stars, but I rounded down due to lack of follow-up service.  Hosting - 4 Friendly &  polite.  Service - 3 Professional, but lacking follow-up.  We were not offered timely refills or even a \"How's it going?\" until the end of our meal.  Food - 3.5 Very good.  Had the chicken & waffles with their own spicy maple syrup.  Good crispy waffle, but the chicken was pretty dry and flavorless.  My partner had the eggs & sausage.  They were light & fluffy, but nothing to write home about.  Decor - 4 Very Wynn-like tasteful and pretty.  The seats and couches were very comfortable and luxurious.  I've previously eaten here at The Terrace Pointe Cafe and had better food & service.  But, it is an oasis from all the hustle & bustle of Vegas.  Also, the lobby is worth the walk thru.",

I was in Vegas for work, every moment of my down time was spent at the Wynn property and I cannot say enough great things about my overall experience at this hotel - the room was beautiful and the casino is very well organized and great.  With that being said, the experience I had at this cafe this morning will likely result in me never giving Wynn another dime.  I gambled all night on Tuesday 3/8/16 @ the Wynn and as a result the casino host comped me and my business partner our breakfast at the terrace point cafe.  As soon as I walked in I found myself waiting in line to be seated in a pretty much empty establishment, literally waited patiently for 5 minutes for whatever reason is unknown to me.  Upon seating, it took at least 10 minutes to get our beverages, my water was never topped off.  Numerous employees walked by my empty water several times.  At one point I got up out of my seat and walked over to the bar to get my water refilled myself, the bartender proceeded to key punch something in the computer and didn't even look up at me or greet me even though I was hovering and in obvious need of assistance.  When I finally interjected, he didn't even let me say what I needed and told me that he'll \"be right back\" with an annoyed tone.  The food was just mediocre, nothing special.  The steak I had with my eggs was extremely fatty for a strip and was very thin, the biscuits and gravy are an outright abomination. Given the fact that this eatery is located on the Wynn property, I figured it would be paired with a \"Wynn\" level of service, I was wrong.  It's a shame that this experience is going to lead to me having to find a new favorite casino/hotel when I venture to Vegas in the future, get it together!",

They ordered huevos rancheros from the vegan menu and we were horrified to discover they had given her the wrong dish, and she ended up eating pork for the first time in 28 years. The staff didn't realize how important this was for her, they tried to make up for it by comping her meal but unfortunately nothing can take back her experience of eating pork and breaking a lifetime of commitment to her religious beliefs. She was mortified, and was unable to continue with brunch. She was visibly distraught and tearful. They offered to call security to make some type of incident report but after an hour no one showed up. I'm just so shocked because what if his was a life threatening food allergy? This place needs to be more conscious and aware of dietary restrictions of their guests. It's safe to say I will not be coming back. Nothing and no comps can make up for what was taken from her. Anyone who holds strongly held beliefs will understand this.",

We found out that the Wynn had some amazing buffet options and decided to go there for breakfast. We stopped into here because of their croissant French toast. It sounds as amazing as it sounds. My best friend had the cream cakes egg Benedict. Both dishes were amazing and great sizes. The wait wasn't long and the service was like no other. I will definitely stop by here the next time I'm in Vegas.",

All meals were tasty and we loved every bite of it   As for the staff, I really liked how there were different people for different things, people who bring the food, people who bring the drinks and the server of course. This ensures that the server has all the help they need and can focus on the guest needs. Within that, we had to ask for hot sauce and remind the server a second time. Which he brought.

    "text": "First off, I must mention that I originally posted this review under Tableau at Wynn, and that was incorrect, it was Terrace Point Cafe that I visited.  Someone from the Wynn team contacted me about that review, and we figured out I was referring to the wrong restaurant.  That conversation itself was stilted and odd, but at least we figured it out.  So, below is my review for the correct restaurant.  Mea culpa.  However, my review still stands for Terrace Point Cafe.  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~  If you'd have suggested I would be giving Terrace Point Cafe anything other than a solid 5 stars, I would have thought you were out of your mind.  Being gluten free and vegan, I anticipated Wynn restaurants would be the most amazing selection of food I could ever imagine for someone like me.  A virtual Shangri La.  It was not.  I went to the concierge, and let them know that I had heard Wynn was famous for its vegan offerings, but that I had an added twist of also needing gluten free.  The concierge was accommodating, helpful, and not only suggested Terrace Point Cafe, but also made us a reservation and promised they would have multiple options for me.  He was wrong.  We arrived and were seated and when I looked at the menu there was nothing.  We asked our server for recommendations.  Her recommendation?  A salad.  Ok, I get it, the vegan option is a salad, but I'd have to put \"this\" salad with \"this\" dressing and take off \"this\" ingredient, blah blah blah.  Not very creative.  If you want to offend a vegan....offer them a salad.  I explained I was looking for more than a salad.  A perplexed stare ensued.  Our server went to the chef, who offered to make me some sauteed vegetables.  That was literally the recommendation. Some.Sauted.Vegetables.Period. Considering that I expected the bill for this dinner to be on the high side, I wasn't going to be satisfied, or full, with the standard vegan fare salad, and maybe some sauteed vegetables.    I noticed there was rice on the menu.  I asked if maybe we could put aforementioned \"sauteed vegetables\" on some rice.  Nope, the rice is not gluten free.  Apparently they put flour or some other crazy shenanigans in their rice.   I explained MULTIPLE times that I was sorry this was such a hassle, but I had specifically gone to the concierge to ensure that I would not be causing a scene, because I cannot stand being \"that person\" and making a spectacle of myself when just trying to get a meal, and he had assured me that there would be plenty of gluten free, vegan options and now I find out that there were not.  To cut the story short, we paid $10 for our bottle of Fiji water, got up and left, and went to VegeWay instead.  We won't be trying anymore restaurants at the Wynn in the future.  I try to avoid the Strip altogether, and should have stuck with that approach to begin with.",

My vegan friend was able to find suitable food AND a vegan bloody Mary, and the rest of us were happy as well.  I had the bacon avocado omelet without the bacon; it came with a tomato salsa (with just the right amount of kick to it) and was quite good. The potatoes on the side were great as well, and the large helping of sourdough toast really hit the spot.   Service was a bit hit-or-miss; our server seemed to be having a less-than-great day; my friend's bloody Mary first came out un-vegan and had to be replaced, which seemed to annoy our server a bit, but she was otherwise warm. It also wasn't the world's fastest service, but we were in no hurry so all was well.   It's also just a very homey place that kind of gave me Golden Girls vibes. Your mileage may vary, but I was into it.",

(The have it listed as a tofu omelet, but they can scramble it for you as they used to have a tofu scramble..).  If you're coming on a weekend morning, be prepared to wait.. but its worth it if you are looking for a good vegetarian friendly breakfast. Our party of 6 waited about 20-30 minutes, but the restaurant got really busy soon after.  The breakfast potatoes were delicious with a good amount of flavor and the right level of crisp. Definitely worth trying!  Coffee was good, and kept being refilled, which was much needed.   Overall a beautiful restaurant with great vegetarian/vegan options and definitely worth checking out!",

The chicken and waffle was extremely unique and tasted fantastic. The waffle has bacon and chives in it, so it's savory, and the chipotle syrup is an interesting sweetness with a smokey kick. It's topped with a fried egg which added a great richness.   The lettuce wraps were fairly standard, and tasted similarly to the ones at PF Changs.   My friend got the steak and eggs, and the steak was perfectly cooked and very tender.   The service was only so so, which isn't normal for somewhere in the Wynn. It took a really long time to get out food, and just as long to get a check when we were done.   I'll still go back again and again for that waffle!   But seriously, it is WAY over air conditioned. Dress warm.",

Our non-vegan waiter confided that this dish was his favorite. I was so excited about all the vegan brunch items but when I heard that, I just had to get it. No lie...it tasted like the real deal, maybe even better!  I also got to have my fancy schmancy Jasmine tea so I was super happy when we were here. Breakfast was pretty pricey, especially considering my bf had the Maine lobster Benedict and unlimited mimosas but he quickly won back the money when we walked over to a roulette table afterwards. It was a fantastic start to our day. The Wynn is a winner!",

Whenever we stay at the Wynn/Encore, this place is always our first morning there breakfast. The place is gorgeous and we love sitting outside by the pool relaxing with our coffee and juice first thing. Taking in the warm Vegas air and wafting smells of breakfast mixed with suntan lotion.   The servers are extremely pleasant and accommodating.  The food is prepared and plated beautifully. And it tastes like nothing else you've had. I have no idea how they make pancakes taste so different and delicious, but they do it!  I love the Wynn because all the restaurants will also provide a Vegan menu if you prefer to go that route or have dietary restrictions.  If you need something to get you going in the morning have coffee at the Wynn. It is some of the strongest and most delicious coffee you will have.",

I had the chicken n waffles ($20), with a side of breakfast potatoes ($4) & sausage ($4). The waffles were excellent. They were dusted lightly with powdered sugar & served with vegan butter. It comes with BBQ syrup, which is an acquired taste; it was ok, but I prefer maple syrup, which they'll provide upon request. The \"chicken\" was ok. It was was nicely fried & crunchy, but it could use a tad more flavor/seasoning in its crust/batter. The country potatoes were excellent & full of flavor. The sausage was ok; nothing special.  This was a lot of food. It lasted me 2 days.   It was a nice restaurant with a classy ambiance. The employees were friendly, attentive, and knowledgable re their vegan offerings.   As for the dress code, think business casual.   The next time I'm in Vegas, I'll return here to try more of their vegan options.",

Be careful of the birds when sitting outside.  UPDATE:  I went back here and sat on the patio.  The restaurant was not packed and was able to get a seat fairly quickly.  Well, that was the good part.  Waited 10 minutes for someone to come by.  They did after I flagged down the hostess.  About 3 min after that.  I was ready to order and he indicated he could only take my drink order.  I said  OK and ordered a beer.  That came out in about 4 min.  Waited another 8 min and flagged down the hostess again.  The guy that took my drink order showed up 2 min later!!!!!! I said I thought you couldn't take my food order.  All I heard from his is womp womp womp womp...like the teacher from Charlie Brown.  Excuses that I didn't want to hear.  Fix it or make amends.    Vegan Chickn and Waffles is so good I couldn't walk out, but would have in every other case.

The waffles are cooked impeccably; its crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside. I usually have them add the bacon to inside the waffle and serve it with whip cream and fresh sweet cut strawberries. Yet depending on my mood and appetite I also sometimes order it with fried chicken and eggs which they serve with a Cajun syrup and I always order a pitcher of the Palmers Peach Tea ( alcoholic beverage, simply delicious ).",

I normally don't ever finish my plate and I simply devoured it. The skillet potatoes have a Cajun seasoning to it and they taste perfect with the steak which is also extremely good quality. Do visit this place for their breakfast if you have the time!",

An unexpected outside delight was the group of crows that hang out on the bannisters and umbrellas.  They are such monkeys!  We loved watching them drink from the mist sprayers and hop around snootily choosing which gourmet crumbs they like and which aren't to their liking.   I guess the one downside of sitting on the terrace was being in the quiet company of so many buttoned-up types.  Our fellow diners were stuffy grumps, sitting silently across from each other and scowling instead of engaging in conversation.  It was like being in a caricature of what rich people are like.  We ordered two helpings of the vegan chicken and waffles, two bellinis, and a blackberry tart to share.  The food was to die for.  I especially liked the spicy syrup.  Our server was Lisa and she was grand.  Can't wait to go back!",

Yes, it was a nice oasis from the Wynn buffet line (which was too long to bother with - it looked like something from Disney).  Lunch was inside (very comfortable, excellent service) and Brunch was outside (Hot in June despite misters) and the other reviews mentioning the Grackle Birds are correct - but it was not a big deal.  Food on both days was very good and reasonably priced (for Vegas).  Lunch was the Shrimp, Crab and Lobster Club that was fresh and very satisfying!  Brunch was the Benedict \"Sampler\" that allowed a mix and match of Lobster, Pork Belly or Canadian Bacon.  I opted for 2 lobsters and a belly.  It was a very nice sized portion and plenty of lobster was included.  My daughter got a red velvet pancake that was enormous (only order 1!) and delish.  The atmosphere is really relaxing and we would go back anytime.",

Ani tuna tartare appetizer was completely flavorless and was served with some rice cake crackers that were not appetizing in the least. PASS for sure.  Had the mahi mahi grilled fish sandwich for entree which was good, not great.   Service was a bit slow.   You cannot beat the location of the restaurant though; sat outside on the patio, overlooking the pool and enjoyed the beautiful weather.  Overall decent, but should be better considering the prices.",

Birds .. That's what they do.. Am not sure if the management could or should do anything about this, I don't have an opinion on this at this point, but left to me, I'd prefer not to have those birds super close to the food.  Now the good parts- the wait time was pretty accurate, they brought the food out in time, and as my rating reflects, the food was just delicious! We had the crab Benedict and French toast, both very well made and presented.   Gabriel was our waiter and he was terrific! Informative and good humored; simple enough you'd think, but those are two qualities that have become quite hard to find  of late at restaurants (yeah am talking about a bunch of other Vegas joints including Gordon Ramsay's burgr)  Sure to return to the terrace pointe cafe!!",

    "text": "Another decidedly mediocre experience I had at the Wynn last weekend. I know expecting a yummy breakfast out of a cafe is stupid. That being said, at $25 per person or so for an entree and some coffee I'd like it to taste at least as good as OPH or IHOP!  I started with a large mocha. It was weak, had hardly any mocha flavor, and definitely not worth the $6 or $7 they charge.   My husband and I shared a waffle and the french toast sandwich. The waffle was very blah. I really like the waffles at Waffle House, Roscoe's, and Bouchon to name a few. I think making a yummy waffle is possible - they don't all have to taste mediocre. These were just above eggos.  The french toast sandwich was a sloppy mess of awful. it was just eggs, meat and french toast thrown on a plate and no attempt to make a sandwich was visible. Each component was bad individually and when eaten in conjunction with one another. I was wishing for a McGriddle as I was downing this thing. Yup, that bad.   I would say breakfast here was like eating at a Marriot hotel cafe in a random city. A bit disappointing given the price point and the location at the Wynn. Next time we will walk over to Bouchon !!!",

    "text": "Totally made a mistake eating here before our flight. We had to wait in a long line to get seated and the service was just soooooo slow that we really cut it so close in missing our flight back to LA. And I guess their breakfast menu ends early? We got seated around 11:30 and they didn't have any brunch or breakfast menus available anymore. Some places serve breakfast until 3pm. It's either we missed their cut or they just didn't gave us the breakfast/brunch menu.  We ordered the Hawaiian Ahi Poke for appetizer and Chipotle Mahi Sandwich for two people to share.  *Hawaiian Ahi Poke - It was fresh and pretty good and I liked how they used rice crackers (kinda same texture as prawn crackers) instead of chips. It was mildly spicy, which I like because it had a nice kick to it. I also enjoyed the seaweed salad on top of it and they were pretty generous with the avocado.  * Chipotle Mahi Sandwich - The sandwich was meh, ok. It was actually more on the dry side and it was feat finishing my half of the sandwich. We opted for a side of fruits with our sandwich instead of fries or a side salad. That was a good idea since it was nice palette cleanser and it kinda served as a dessert.  Our server was not that attentive at all and service could be better overall. I wish Wynn had a better selection of restaurants inside their hotel.",

    "text": "I never expect too much from hotel restaurants but I was hoping that with the new vegan dictate from Steve Winn to make vegan menus in all the restaurants, this would be a good choice.   The food was good. There was a vegan menu with a few choices for each meal. I had the Soba Seaweed Salad. This was good but a little sweet. The Arame on the salad was good but the flavor was covered up by the sweet sauce. Perfect amount of ginger though. The cucumber instead of being shredded, was just mush but the Enoki mushrooms made it for me.  Why the 3 stars though? The service. Not that it was slow or bad, but it was too aggressive. I get that it was busy but we were seated and within 10 seconds I was expected to order a drink before I even picked up the drink menu. I asked that he come back, he never did. I put my order in with the waiter and he passed it on to the drink guy. The waiter came by 2 times way too quickly to take the order and the second time was very pushy about us ordering.   Serving is finding a balance between being prompt and being slow. This place does not have this down. From the other reviews they sound slow, my experience was they were too pushy. They should just go in between the extremes.",

Ho hum...other Yelpers loved it so I definately recommend it since it does include lobster.    No drinks ordered and boyfriend had to take 3/4 of his pancake to go b/c it was so large and rotund.

    "text": "Review of dining experience: My party of 4 and I were seated promptly upon arrival. We ordered drinks  for starters and my friend had a long piece of hair in his water! Gross! We asked a worker to change the water and it took about 20 minutes before his new water came out. The other drinks were served within a reasonable time but it took forever just to get water! We probably asked a different waitress/hostess/busboy/supervisor a few times because we didn't know which one was our waitress. It was just water and not in the food so we forgot about it but I just realized that we weren't even offered a discount for an unenjoyable experience. Yes, no biggie for water but it would have been nice for a higher end cafe to offer something more than an embarrassed apology. Unprofessional for the setting but ohh well.   Review of the vegan chickn with scallion waffles: It's pretty good! I ordered this just to try it. The chicken is like a big crispy chicken nugget... Maybe tofurkey? I'm a carnivore though so it wasn't the taste I was looking for that day.   The scallion waffles (scallions are actually added in the batter!) are served with maple syrup and vegan butter. You don't really taste the scallions and its a good combination. I would definitely recommend this dish if you're vegetarian or vegan, but if ya love your chicken, the cost is the same for real chicken and waffles PLUS eggs! I kinda wished I got the breakfast non-vegan option with eggs instead.   If you're a carnivore but want to taste a more affordable vegan dish, the veggie burger comes with fries and a chocolate shake for $9! I kinda wish I tried that instead.  Review of the coffee: Worth it! The aroma, the strength, mmmm so worth it to wake you up.",

We also had the chicken quesadillas which were also outstanding.  Then I ordered shrimp Alfredo pasta,  wow,  it was so so delicious.  The shrimp had this spicy paste which went perfect with the Alfredo.  Finally,  for dessert we ordered the chocolate molten cake which had the perfect balance of sweet and the bread pudding with a sauce over it and ice cream.  The latter,  was superb.  Overall, we were happy with the service,  but the food is really what deserves 5 stars and more.  I can't wait to go back and grub.  No more buffets for me. I'll be eating here from now on.",

By the time the 4 of us got there, we were starving so we turned it into a lunch meeting. We ordered a breakfast skillet, a burger, sliders & crab/lobster sandwich with fries & coleslaw. The coffee was very tasty but it is very strong, with almost a cacao undertone... lots of cream & sugar was used! Our waiter was on-point & very pleasant. Then, our food came!... yes, the price point is higher (it is the Wynn, afterall) but I think you get comparable portions. By the time we were full, we realized that- had it not been a professional occasion- we probably could have gone without 1 or 2 of the dishes. I'll definitely be going back. Maybe with someone who can do something with the hideous uniforms the women have to wear. They look like oversized nurses uniforms from one of the World Wars... in neon magenta? [sigh] Throw in an extra buck or two for their humiliation.",

My bf and I had lunch here near a window, and although it was a chilly January day, we had the chance to look out onto the beautiful patio and pool.  This cafe had standard food and service.  We started with Bloody Marys and were disappointed with their blandness.  My Bf ordered the burger with bacon, avocado, and all the fixings.  I had a bite and wanted more.  I orded a soup and salad, wanting something on the lighter side.  I figured I couldn't go wrong.  The chicken caesar was served with full romaine hearts drizzled with caesar dressing along side a couple of bland chicken tenderloins.  I expected a standard tossed salad.  I only warn you so that if you order this (which I don't recommend, it wasn't good) you'll know what you're getting.  The french onion soup was cheesy and warm.  The food was served quickly and servers were attentive.  I'll come back but just order something different.",

I received a regular pancake and it took her 20 minutes to replace the pancake..at first she was just going to bring me some blueberries to put on top..which is not a blueberry pancake..needless to say...After 20 minutes of waiting I canceled it.  My eggs were delivered to me cold.  My husbands chicken and waffles were pretty bad too.  The chicken was flattened..breaded and fried..you could barely cut it.  What did the manager do?  took the pancake off my bill.  Off the list!",

I'm scared of birds so I wouldn't recommend sitting outside.   The food was mediocre from the last time I remembered coming here. Split a Caesar salad, French Onion Soup and Chicken Pesto Sandwich this time.   My family knew to order right away because it takes forever to get your food so we did so and like we expected, took awhile to get our food. The salad was drenched in dressing and the lettuce was soggy. The French Onion Soup was alright, tastes better at Mimi's Cafe. The flavor was pretty strong, a little too strong. The Chicken Pesto Sandwich was average as well. Small and nothing special about it. Felt like I could have gone to Panera or something to get it. The fries that came with the sandwich were pretty damn awesome though. Crunchy, fresh and pretty much gourmet fries! From what I remember from my last visit, I would order a burger because I vaguely remember them being pretty good. I will give this place another try the next time and let you know how it goes!",

I will applaud the decor and overall atmosphere as excellent but the food quality and pricing isn't in line with one another.  I had an average/below average grilled chicken sandwich, requested raw onions to be added to the standard lettuce/tomato only to be charged an extra $3.00 for the raw onions.  I get that I am eating at a fantastic and expensive hotel...but that was annoying considering the sandwich wasn't worth half of the $16.00 it cost me, nor did I request grilled and/or caramelized onions...just raw.  It is my understanding that breakfast is TPC's forte, and in fairness I did not try any breakfast selection, but I will admit the pancakes and waffles being served to other guests did look very good!  The service was ok, definitely not up to the Wynn standard, so don't go there expecting much.  Honestly, you're much better off simply going to The Buffet and getting whatever you want instead of wasting your time here.",

    "text": "One of the better places to get some quality food at a decent price without having to leave the Encore or Wynn.  It's pretty much on par with Zooza Crackers but because I went to Zooza prior to being a Yelper, I'll talk about Terrace Pointe Cafe.  Came in here for brunch and what I like about the restaurant is that it is spacious and has a great view of the Wynn pool and the sun shines through the glass doors that provide easy access to the pool itself. It really is a nice way to get your day started and a nice option if you aren't feeling like gorging yourself at a buffet.  I had the Wynn Burger and it was good partially due to the fact I was craving a burger. Nothing too fancy but it also didn't disappoint.   A quick tip in case you're coming wanting breakfast options but instead happen to stroll in well into brunch time is that you can ask your waiter to provide a breakfast menu and they're pretty good about making what you want. It was nice because I went in thinking \"pancakes\" but my stomach and the inner-dude in me said \"get the burger.\" Though I must say the pancakes did look tasty from watching the people sitting next to us enjoying various breakfast items.  In the end, this place gets the job done and is a good affordable (most items are in the $10-20 range)choice as a breakfast or lunch option where you can sit on the terrace overlooking the pool. As for later in the day, I'd opt for Zooza Crackers just because it's situated in the center of all the hustle and bustle and it's fun to people watch from their open booths. Also a great late night option for food.",

We came here around 1:00pm without a reservation and didn't have to wait long for a table, but I soon see why the wait is not long and the restaurant is not packing with people waiting in line. Here is the score card and summary of the experience:  Decor: 4, being a restaurant in Wynn, it's expected the standard to be high and it's very flower-y inside but things really go downhill from that point.  Service: 3, average service, brought your food over, refill your drink at a very slow pace, and we were not really asked how was our food and was charged 18% for gratuity because our party's size (9 people), which I don't really think they deserve.  Food: 1, I ordered a BBQ bacon burger and the food came in under-flavored and was way too greasy. Ordered the burger at medium well but turned out to be well done.   Value: 1, for the food that we ordered, it was totally over-priced. I really expected much greater things for a burger that's $17. (no sides)  This restaurant is right next to pool at Wynn, but even if the pool is filled with America's Top Models, its food's lameness would not persuade me to come back.",

The first morning I was in Vegas, my sister and I had a delicious breakfast at Terrace Pointe Cafe. I had a vegan french toast with a side of vegan butter, maple syrup and strawberries. I also had an amazing soy latte. My sister ordered the regular french toast which was rolled in cereal and topped with candied pecans and a grilled banana. She said it tasted amazing! The waitress even asked if I had any food allergies. I explained that my vegan lifestyle was based on compassion vs allergies but was still so thrilled that she asked. My sister did not give the question much thought but when her food came with an unexpected slice of strawberry on the top (to which she is VERY allergic) they took the plate away immediately and made her a fresh batch strawberry free. We were just blown away by how helpful and accommodating they were to both of us. We also got to watch birds out by their pool/garden. It was peaceful and beautiful. We both asked for to-go containers and she brought me more vegan butter and syrup to take with me. Awesome! The next time I visit with my husband I plan to try more of their restaurants! I am sure I will be very pleased. All you vegans visiting Las Vegas, please be sure you support these restaurants and review them! We have full vegan menus at the south end and the north end of the Strip so we need to fill the gap!!",

After that our order was taken and 35 minutes later they realized they had forgotten to bring it out.  Two stars because the food was good, but worst service I've experienced and Steve Wynn would likely be appalled. Not a good look.",

Vegan French Toast- Thick bread, comes with strawberries. Very filling.  They have a dress code that isn't enforced with larger groups (Yeah, I saw you Mr. No-Sleeves... we all saw you).

The French toast is amazing. Get it covered in granola. It is sweet, fluffy, and textured all at the same time. We couldn't get enough of it, and normally I'm done with French toast after a pitiful half-slice. The huevos rancheros were very savory and had many different flavors and textures.  If you can ignore the dated Wynn decor and the incredibly cheesy and unflattering bright pink hostess outfit, this is where you want to spend your time. Bonus: no two-hour wait for the buffet, which is about 50 feet away.",

Doesn't the need to earn a paycheck just ruin everything sometimes!?!  I mean, that's the only reason we left this cafe that felt like a little piece of heaven.  But then again, we were in Vegas for work so technically it's also the only reason we were there in the first place...  So we came here for breakfast and sat outside for the fabulous view of the pool since we would be in air conditioning all day.  Comfy seating, breathtaking views of the Wynn property, friendly service from the moment we walked in the door, amazing food at pretty high - yet worth it prices and birds.  Lots and lots of birds trying to get in on the leftover action.  Yes...I certainly could have done without those birds.  But everything else outshines this, particularly the food!!  I had the Asparagus & Truffle Omelet which was sinfully delicious and my friend had the Vegan French Toast.  Both delish!!  We also shared a \"small\" fruit cup since we saw others order the fruit plate which was beautifully presented but pretty large and definitely a meal on it's own.  Since the Vegan French Toast had tons of fresh strawberries on it and my omelet was served with not just hash browns but toast as well, we have more than enough food.    Had this place been open for dinner, we certainly would have come back!",

My friends and I had the LEO, brioche French toast, and eggs benedict. They were all very tasty, especially the French toast. Yes, while it was a but spendy ($20 per entree) I think we certainly got what we paid for. The service was excellent too. They even have a vegan menu!   If you're on the strip looking for a nice breakfast place, check it out. I probably wouldn't visit again just because there are so many places to choose from in Vegas, but I'm glad I got to dine there at least once.",

For starters I strongly recommend the $20/glass bottomless mimosas that are refilled frequently.  This isn't a huge menu but it has all you need for a great lunch or brunch with variety for half sandwiches and soups or salads.  I had the tuna sandwich that was just the right size and a generous bowl of fresh fruit.  As an appetizer we shared the chips with guacamole and salsa along with the tuna poke all were more than satisfying.  One thing I love about all Wynn properties are the vegan options that my brunch mates enjoyed and I did as well for a vegan banana split.    I would recommend waiting for outdoor seating on a nice day and the service is great as expected without anyone trying to rush you off as you enjoy your food and the weather/view.",

The cafe has indoor and outdoor seating, if the weather permits, I suggest sitting outside which offers a pretty view of the swimming pool.  This was my last day in Vegas and I wanted to make sure I spent some 'alone' time with my niece. I met her in the lobby of the Wynn so naturally I suggested the cafe I noticed earlier. We were greeted and seated immediately with a nice view of the pool. The menu had a few tempting (fat laden) items but I was drawn to the veggie omelet. My niece exclaimed \"Chicken and Waffles! Together? For breakfast?\" (she's from the UK). I immediately urged her to 'try something new', in other words I wanted to try the C&W as I've never had them. The waiter took our order and delivered the coffee and juice quickly.   We enjoyed watching the people in the pool (people are so weird) while waiting for our food which came out piping hot and beautifully displayed. My veggie omelet was delightful, the 'square' of hash browns crispy / tender and the rye toast was very fresh and delicious. The chicken and waffles were a big hit. Bacon bits in the waffle with white meat chicken tenders topped with a fried egg. My niece ordered the spicy syrup and it was the perfect hot / sweet combination. The waffles were airy and crisp, the crust on the chicken was fried to golden perfection. I never thought I would like this combination but was I proven wrong. Hot damn, all of the flavors combine together for a sinfully wonderful treat.   The check hit the table and holy cow: $60! They nickel and dime you to death in Vegas so think twice about ordering extras (like a side of salsa). Though expensive, I would visit this place again for the C&W.",

Try their Sea Bass or coconut shrimp. Panini is just ok.",

When my meal finally came the bartender said it was worth the wait. I wasn't happy. My husband had the biscuits and gravy and it was too dry to finish.

The dishes were not well seasoned and bland. We had ordered 2 freshly squeezed orange juice, which frankly tasted like it was out of a bottle. We even ordered dessert, molten lava cake and citrus panna cotta. The panna cotta was not even set. Overall, all the dishes were unimpressive.

It's a beautiful cafith e indoor and outdoor seating.,   It was too hot for me to sit outside but they had large umbrellas with misters and the pool beyond so others might like it.  I visited Bouchon just last week and I have to say hands-down Terrqace Pointe Cafe is better.  The service was a bit slow... I'm guessing a lot of people have the \"monday flu\" after a busy weekend!  None the less the food was really terrific.  First and foremost they had a healthy fresh green juice that I love and enjoy so that was a treat.  I ordered trio of eggs benediict and except for a couple of minor things, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Perfect sauce.  Pefectly poached eggs.  One had lobster and it was simply overcooked.  That came with corn and green been hash that was fresh, fresh, fresh and perfectly al dente.  One of the trios was with pork belly on a bisquit.  It may have been pork belly but i think most people would know it as thick cut bacon.  Tasty but not the slow cooked, soft and uber fatty pork belly I've had elsewhere.  My criticisms are really minor. I darn near licked the plate clean.  (and might have it no on was looking!)    Overall, really pretty.  Immaculate bathrooms and everything else... I would definitely go back.",

We chose to sit outside and it was a beautiful cool sunny morning and all was just grand. The drinks got to us quick and the staff was in top of it until we ordered the food. Then the coffee refills became less frequent and so did the ice teas.  We had to hail 3 different waiters to fetch our daughter more dressing for her salad. Which, again, if we didn't have a million things planned for the day, would not have bothered us but we did. Next time, mention before sit down! NOTED!  We ordered the Cobb salad with the Greek dressing, truffle fries, BLT and a Caesar Salad. The Cobb looked delish and was confirmed as so by the beau and the Caesar needed more dressing. My BLT and truffle fries were super yummy! I just wish they gave me a side of mayo....  :). (Traditionalist here!)  Overall a 3 and easily could have been a 4 but the lack of service and our time crunch and us havering to hail 3 wait staff then actually get up and find our waitress....dropped it down to a 3....",

I went with the huevos rancheros which were amazing.  Served in a skillet, there is a potato and chorizo base and on top of that a fluffy egg with avocado, cheese and cream. It comes with two additional sauces, one a spicy chipotle and a guacamole like cream.  I also ordered a side of bacon, they ask if you'd like it regular or crispy - go with regular - crispy is to much!!  Service here is quick and efficient, and a large menu with plenty of options, a great breakfast option!",

I wanted to sit on the patio initially but was told it would be a wait. We opted to sit inside and placed our order. I got the Benedict trio because it came highly recommended on Yelp. I got a pancake on the side. The hubs got steak and eggs. The best part of the meal was the pancake. The Benedict trio was disgusting. The regular Benedict's hollandaise sauce had no flavor. The crab cake one was mushy and tasted like tuna not crab. The turkey was was unbelievably nasty. I couldn't even finish it I just ate the egg. The steak and eggs were like something you could find at Denny's. Overall it wasn't worth it for the amount we spent. I will say however that our server was super sweet and attentive. But the food, in my opinion, was forgettable.",

The waitress \"Kari\" was ok and the first reason why I took a star off. I ordered the immunity boost juice and an asparagus mushroom truffle omelette. The food came pretty quick. It was delicious. The omelette came with fried potato slices which I didn't like as they had been kept heated for too long and were not fresh/crisp. It also came with 2 slices of bread. It was delicious only my second slice disappeared with all the birds roaming around attacking the table. They are aggressive, they even got a piece of my omelette. The juice was delicious. It is also pre made so the health aspect goes away with that (to get the vitamins a juice needs to be consumed ASAP you lose vitamin value over time).  What was annoying is that the waitress made me feel like I was a child. I ate pretty much everything but I took my time. I was by myself, on vacation and was stuck on a plane without food the night before for 9 hours - I was trying to get as much calories in as possible from my order. The waitress came ask me with a tone if I was done yet. I felt belittled. It wasn't that busy anymore so it was not for a faster turnover, there were plenty of tables open.  So the potato taste, juices are pre made, and waitress belittling me, results in a 3 Star review. But I would try this place again, the view and seating is wonderful and the omelette itself was delicious.",

The service could definitely use some improvement. The whole time I had no idea who are server was, as several different people attempted to help us. In the end they even billed me wrong ( probably because the staff aren't very well guided on which tables are there's).

You're only served 2 crab eggs Benedict's, but I could only finish one(because it's the kinda dish you can only have a little of).

If you're a vegan, you obviously know that Steve Wynn's Empire is very vegan-friendly, which each of his restaurants featuring an entire plant-based menu. If you're looking for a gourmet breakfast or brunch, Terrace Pointe Cafe is the place to be.  Walk past the ridiculously long Buffett line (also worth checking out), and put your name down here for a table on the patio. If you do, you'll get to be seated next to the grand canal that is their resort pool, with the beautiful sun twinkling off the soft ripples of the water. It is a gorgeous view and I'm low...high-key jealous of those who are swimming in it.  As mentioned before, there is an entirely separate vegetarian/vegan menu that is pretty expansive and doesn't cut any corners. Gourmet salads, soups, and appetizers are just the beginning. They've recently added Impossible Sliders to the menu! I must come back to try their version as I love the Impossible Burger.  But I had my eyes on 1 thing, and 1 thing only-The Vegan Chicken & Waffles.  And the Unlimited Mimosas.  Ok ok, so 2 things. But in my mind, it is the perfect Brunch.  Our server set us down with 2 fresh glasses of bubbly & juice and we soaked in the warmth. Our server kept them coming all meal long, having two full glasses ready for us not long after we've sipped the last. She knew what we wanted and she delivered!  When our meal arrived, my eyes hungrily gazed at the monster that appeared before me. A full-sized waffle topped with a large extra crispy sized veg chicken cutlet on top. A whopping serving of vegan butter and TWO syrups for my delight (regular & spicy!).  I poured the syrup & butter over my dish and savored each and every one of those crispy, warm, sweet, spicy, salty bites. I'm not a huge chicken & waffles gal. In fact, I think the concept is pretty weird; But I came to Vegas to indulge, and indulge I did.  3/4 of a waffle, 1 tablespoon of vegan butter & syrup, and 5 glasses of mimosas later, the world started feeling light. I felt perfectly stuffed, with a slight feeling of gluttony. The mimosas & 90-degree weather made me want to pull a pillow our right then and there and take a [fat] cat nap.  But our server wasn't done with us yet. She did not take no for an answer. Instead, she ordered us up 1 more round of mimosas and put it into a takeaway cup and sent us on our way.  I drank it on the walk back to our resort, and immediately & happily passed out for a few hours before resuming the rest of our day. It is definitely the best way to start our vacation.",

    "text": "Brunch on a Saturday or Sunday morning is EXACTLY what I need after a night of hardcore partying. Whether you're there during the summer or the winter, Terrance Pointe's got somethin' for you. It's a special little tucked away treat that you can only get in Vegas.   First off, the ambiance here is amazing. It's tucked in a less-traveled corner of the Wynn, so it's not your typical eatery. The couches... the couches. So good after you've been in heels for 4+ hours and slept about the same. You can kick off your flip-flops and just relax.  The service is also beyond expected. The staff knows their stuff, they engage with you and make you feel welcome. They also make amazing recommendations.   The food and drinks are why we keep coming back, though. Americano fan? GET ON IT. Plain ol' drip coffee connoisseur? Also an excellent choice. In the summer, opt for something lighter like the granola-yogurt-fruit plate. They won't serve you melon; they've got berries and mango for you. The French toast plate -- while not the leanest option -- is well worth it, with ham, cheese, hash browns and eggs to boot. We ordered the eggs over medium and they were served exactly over medium. In the winter, you absolutely must do the tomato soup with grilled cheese. MUST. It'll warm your soul and you'll learn the True meaning of that phrase.   I look forward to visiting Terrance Pointe every time I go to Vegas, hungover or not. I recommend you make it part your routine too.",

After waiting 30 minutes in line, I was told that my cover-up for my swimsuit was not suitable for sitting indoors. I was told that sitting outside would be an additional 20 minutes on top of the thirty that I had already waited.  I was at the bar.  At the bar I was allowed to order drinks but when I asked if I could order food from the bar I was told that I could not because I was not dressed appropriately and could only eat outside. Being told that you can sit in a bar order and pay for drinks but are not allowed to order food is absolutely ridiculous and it honestly made me feel like I was a dog that had to eat outside. We ordered bottom of this mimosas at the bar and then finally about 30 minutes later were brought to our table outside. After ordering her food are bottomless Mimosas were now empty and sat that way for another 20 minutes making the whole point of bottomless mimosas pointless. When we explained our issue to the server when he finally came back with our food he was very apologetic and did his best to try and rectify the situation. At that point after dealing with the rude hostess as well as the bartender there wasn't much I could be fixed at that point.  I'll be the last time I return to the terrace point.",

We also liked the decor and even noticed the details of the carpet.  We all ordered the 2 half portion sandwich and 1 side combo for $18, I guess that's a decent price for Vegas standards. Portions are like gourmet truck sizes and the food isn't half bad. We were hungry so I ate everything off my plate. I had a vegetable with hummus and pita bread sandwich, the chicken salad apple sandwich, and a side of chicken noodle soup.",

The waffles are crisp and buttery lying beneath a juicy fried piece of chicken. Dip in sauce and you're set.   The wait isn't too bad, but it will get crowded during peak breakfast and lunch hours. My only complaint is the slow service. It's hard to catch a waiter's eye at times, but when they do finally see you, they make sure you're satisfied. I love the ambience and love the decor.

We were a big group and wanted to sit inside due to the heat, so we did have to wait 5-10 minutes, which was totally fine. It took them a little while to take our order and bring coffee/water, but that was fine too.   I ordered the Double Down with the Mini Baguette French Toast with bacon, two eggs any style (I got scrambled), and a side of fruit. For the price, I actually got a decent amount of food...well, I would've if they remembered my bacon :'( The baguette french toast was pretty disappointing as the bread tasted stale and was also very dry (they neglected to bring out syrup). The eggs were scrambled nicely and the fresh fruit was incredible. Coffee was also delicious.  Service wasn't great, but unfortunately, we had a diner in our party that liked to be demanding and rude to waitstaff...so yeah, won't fault ANY restaurant we went to for service because this diner was so high maintenance...The waiter got everyone else's order correct except for mine, which I applaud due to the gazillion customizations made (no bun, no mushrooms, add fruit, no meat, etc etc).  There are a TON of options at Terrace Pointe Cafe and that is why I'd go back--as Vegas often includes big dining parties, this place is perfect because people can really get whatever they want.",

They accommodated my party of 12 but two people had to change their shirts because they had a strict dress code. No sleeveless shirts for men and no see through clothes for women. Besides the dress code, the food was average. High prices for average food. The decor, however, was really nice. One memorable dish that a friend got was the Frosted Flakes french toast. It was sweet, but still good. Overall, I probably wouldn't come here again.",

We got seated outside to views of the pool and garden, which was nice. I ordered a very expensive small glass of freshly squeezed orange juice and my husband had coffee to start.   I finally decided and opted for the 3 different eggs benedict trio (pork belly, crab and regular) and I loved it! The pork belly version was crispy and delicious, like bacon and with the egg yolk dripping on it....perfect! The crab meat benedict didn't have an english muffin on the bottom like the other two, in fact, the CRAB MEAT was the holder! I loved it, generous amounts of crab meat in every bite! I don't know how they managed to keep the eggs from over cooking while still keeping the eggs warm.  My husband got the corned beef hash and while he liked it, he loved my plate more and couldn't stop eating from my plate.  In all honesty, you're paying for the view, because even though my eggs benedicts were good, $65 for brunch for 2 people was a little steep.",

But when the bill came they practically threw the bill at me. I won't be returning. It's a disappointment since the service has been so lovely at all the other Wynn hotels.   I wasn't offered any coffee refills, water, condiments for my dish, all of which were offered to folks next to me. The eggs in my LEO salmon egg bagel dish were completely unseasoned and lacking in flavor.",

He blew our expectations out of the park and his joyful attitude made the experience that much better. We were truly blown away and my grandmother had said she \"wished service was like that everywhere\". Thank you!  On another note, the food was DELICIOUS. The calamari was so much better than many places, it was super flavorful. The Shrimp, Crab and Lobster Club was so yummy as well and super rich in flavor. Those are definitely worth ordering. Oh and you would think the strawberry lemonade was good based on its $8 price, but it's not all that great. lol don't waste your money on it. Other than that, great experience!!",

We decided to check out Terrace Pointe since none of us were hungry enough for the buffet (it's literally right across from it). It wasn't too busy, but we opted for an outside table so we had a short wait. Btw, if the weather is good, I highly recommend sitting outside. It overlooks the pool and it's just really nice and relaxing.  Service is on point and the food is good, but the prices are steep. A BBQ burger already costs $17 and it doesn't even come with anything! You have to pay an extra $4 to add a side of fries. The prices for alcohol aren't cheap either. $12 for a michelada and $21 for a bottomless mimosa. Last I checked, this was just a cafe! I guess you're paying for the presentation and for the atmosphere, but dangg. For what I paid, I might as well have just gone to the buffet!  Bottom line, go for the lovely outside seating and the relaxing environment. It's perfect after a night out and the food isn't bad. But when you're paying over $70 for just two burgers, one side of fries, and essentially 2 beers, I'll probably pass next time.",

They make their own croissant from scratch and they drizzle lemon coconut yogurt over it. Perfectly light and balanced in flavor.  The crab Benedict was also the best I've ever had. Including from establishments who claimed to have \"award-winning\" crab Benedicts. Perfectly done.  The impossible sliders are NOT to be missed!!!!! Delectable and bite size but in every bite is a explosion of complementary flavors. Sesame buns, arugula, grilled mushrooms, crispy onions, and an aioli sauce of some kind. Heaven in a small package (3).   I would revisit just to order any one of these items or maybe all 3!!!  Sooooo goood!!!!  Don't pass up!",

First and foremost, DO NOT be discouraged by the wait line, it goes fast and you will be seated in less than 20 minutes. The services is great, it seems as if they invest a lot in costumer service training. PLUS!  The menu is small, but I promise it won't disappoint. I had the Huevos rancheros and they were delicious. Their selection of fresh juices is a plus, specially waking up on VEGAS (if you know what I mean).

We chose to dine inside but the outside looks like it overlooks the Wynn pool.   The first morning, I have the chicken and waffles. The waffles were very good and they offered a special syrup for the chicken.. spicy syrup. It was very different but it fit well with the dish.  The second morning, I had the biscuits and gravy. I recommend sharing this dish! It came with eggs and the biscuits just melts in your mouth. I can't even forget to mention the gravy!!! IT WAS PERFECTLY seasoned and AMAZINGLY good!   If you have dining credit for the WYNN, spend some of it here!! If not, it can get pricey but worth it!  PS I forgot to mention, they have a vegan and vegetarian option as well!!",

    "text": "That time you walked past the Wynn buffet queue and nope'd out of that because you can't be bothered to wait more than 30 minutes... yep, just keep walking you'll see Terrace Point Cafe, which is a worthy backup!  I was welcomed with a complimentary copy of the daily newspaper and seated facing the window, which provided wonderful natural lighting. I ordered a nonfat cappuccino and happily indulged in the fluffy milk foam - an excellent way to start my day! I ordered the croissant French toast, which was topped with fresh berries, and had the yogurt drizzle on the side. The French toast was more airy and slightly flaky, which I thoroughly enjoyed because who doesn't love a buttery, flaky croissant?! This was really unique and considering I'm not a fan of French toast, this is some I highly recommend trying and would order again! I dropped some of the French toast in the yogurt sauce, which was more sweet than anticipated, but I think the croissant French toast was flavorful and stood out on its own. I also ordered a small bowl of seasonal fruit, which really helped cut down the fat on the french toast.  I loved the natural lighting and high ceilings at this cafe, and it was pretty quite during a weekday brunch, compared to the buffet. Tina was my server and she was very nice and made sure to check up on me when we made eye contact, without being overbearing. I would definitely come back here when I'm in the area because the menu contains quality brunch items :)",

My friend and I were seated immediately when we arrived in the early afternoon, there is lots of seating available.  I ordered the Crab Benedict which comes with Poached Eggs, Lump Crab Cake, Spinach, Spiced Hollandaise and Skillet Potatoes. The poached eggs were perfect and the lump of crab cake is filled with crab meat. They do not skimp! The spinach was a bit of an awkward addition to the dish, I think the dish is better without it! The skillet potatoes were delicious, there was some light seasoning and it wasn't overcooked. I was very happy with my brunch choice :)  The staff were friendly, checked on us throughout our brunch and brought food out to us quickly. I would definitely come here again if I stayed at the Wynn or at Encore :)",

So here we are again, 1 year later, making sure our weekend vacation included those same amazing sliders. I also highly recommend the \"chicken\" and waffles as well as the blueberry tart. Both are truly delicious.   The cafe drinks are wonderfully made, all of the food is made with meticulous care and attention. We love it here. Every member of the staff is friendly and courteous.

I ordered the smoked turkey panini and it was stellar on focaccia. I rarely eat a whole sandwich at restaurants, but this time it was gone.

The dining area at the Cafe was very comfortable, with an excellent view of the garden and pool outside.  For our meal, we ordered the Deep Fried Zucchini, Ahi Tuna Tartare, BBQ Ribs w/ Mash Potatoes, Kobe Beef Sliders, and Creme Brulee.  Overall the plate presentations were nice.  The food though was nothing special.  The Kobe Beef Sliders were the best out of the bunch.  The ribs were sort of tiny.  Where's the meat?  The tuna was average.  For a sorta fancy dining room, the food was pricey as expected. But, you can do better for what you're paying.",

    "text": "Stay indoors!  While it may seem like a nice idea to actually have breakfast on the outdoor terrace in the nice weather and overlooking the Wynn pool, I would strongly recommend against it on account of a serious problem the outdoor portion of the restaurant has with birds, specifically the fairly aggressive--and hungry--great-tailed grackles.  The grackles will perch themselves on top of the umbrellas and then come down any opportunity they get to pick at leftovers or stacks of cleared plates.  It is pretty unappetizing to watch as five of these birds fly down to the table next to you and pick at whatever they can get.  After I requested to be moved inside, they turned on the mist machines, which seemed to help temporarily but, sure enough, the birds returned undeterred.  And if you must dine outside, by no means leave your table temporarily unattended.  Get one of the waitstaff to watch over your food if you have to, or else you may return to find your food having been picked at by these rats with wings.  That all said, once I moved indoors, breakfast was okay.  The Croissant was decent and very fluffy, though not particularly fresh.  These are the same croissants they serve for breakfast in packages throughout the hotel.  The Eggs Benedict Trio was decent: a standard Eggs Benedict, together with a lobster version served on a quarter Belgian waffle and a pork one on a pepper-jack biscuit with Jalapeno hollandaise.  The pork one was probably the best of the trio.",

Con: Outdoor seating was closed today at lunch, even though there was perfect weather and a gentle breeze.  Pro: The setting is nice and even though the place is huge, it feels intimate. Con: The service was laughable.  Total rookie camp, which is not the norm at Wynn.  I think our waiter was either on drugs or had a stomach ailment.  He was acting weird and kept disappearing for long stretches of time.  Pro: Lovely looking shrimp cocktail. Con: I couldn't eat it after witnessing the woman who carried it to our table holding the plate in such a way that the shrimp was actually touching her shirt (right between her armpit and right breast).  Pro: Reasonably priced food for being inside a Strip resort. Con: My turkey club which is pretty hard to mess up didn't taste good.  Pro: Wynn picked up the tab for our table as a comp. Con: We could have better spent that money at any other dining establishment on property.  I will not return.  Even room service blows this place out of the water.",

We had a large table of 10+ so getting the table for a group that size wasn't hard.  Food took a very long time to arrive.   I stuck with something safe like a Portabello Mushroom burger. It was tasty but for the price I paid ... $15 bucks I expect something like omg wow. I rather go to Carls Jr for $6 and be happy and full. The stuff my friends ordered looked ok but It didn't seem to wow me for the price. Some one complained that their salad sucked ...   With $15 I could have gone across the street to Grand Lux and hit up their breakfast buffet. So please read my Grand Lux review for their all you can eat breakfast.",

Based on recommendations that the maine lobster eggs benedict was amazing, I was beyond excited to order it. Thankfully I split it with a friend. Not because it was a huge portion, but because it was just not good. How can it be a benedict without an english muffin? It was on a dry waffle for goodness sake! The over cooked lobster sadly, was tough & chewy. It must have been from last night's leftover. The weird corn succotash that accompanied the dish was random, and this dish completely lacked cohesiveness and flavor. I'm so disappointed but glad I at least had fresh squeezed orange juice.

We stopped in here for lunch on our last Vegas trip. Waiting for the room to get prepped so we could get settled in.   Although it was July and over 100 degrees outside, we opted for the patio seating so we could watch the pool scene. The do a good job with oversized umbrellas and misters. But if you're in direct sunlight you're toast.   I went for the Cobb Salad ($16) and my buddies had a Chinese Chicken ($15) salad and one had a Turkey BLT ($15).  $50 total with tax. Yah it's a bit steep for what we had, but it's Vegas and The Wynn at that. I can deal.   All of us enjoyed what we had. The portions were more than generous. I guess our only complain was they forgot to take the label off the tomato when slicing it for the sandwich.",

Basically The Cafe is a place where diner eats meets Wynn service.  My girls loved the burger, fries and a milkshake meal. I tried the Chicken and waffles for a change from the salads I usually order when dining out. Pure Deliciousness! Being a Vegan and ordering these items is very weird. Nonetheless, we ordered and were very happy when the server swore that all items are guaranteed vegan. The interior is fresh and inviting. We sat indoors because it was afternoon and the sun was a bit warm for our attire. The outside seating area seemed nice but not for this visit. I recommend this place and so do my daughters.",

This time I also got to taste the sea bass, and it was delicious. If you order bacon extra crispy, it always come out perfect, and never burnt. To me, whatever you pay is worth it. You can go and get something from the cafe in the casino for a lesser price, but the portion won't be as good, and the quality certainly won't match. The servers never make you feel rushed, and they're very friendly. If you tell them you have a food allergy, someone from the kitchen comes out to address it and make sure everything will be okay.

The first day my husband had the burger and I had the spinach chicken wrap, both were amazing, and we shared a side of parmesan truffle fries - the name says it all - they were so so good. Brunch - I had chicken and waffles and my husband had the salad, this time we sat out on the terrace by the pool as the weather was amazing, both meals were amazing again.  The staff here were super friendly and helpful on both occasions, the second time it was really busy but our food came out in a timely manner and our drinks were always kept topped up (or else this would have been an automatic 1 star removal review!) I really wanted to try the banana split (something I haven't had since a kid), but each time I was too full :( I guess that means I will have to go back there again",

The seats at the table had crumbs and hair (bleh!) all over them so we couldn't sit down and had to wait for the hostess to clean it up.   After we sat down, absolutely no one came to our table until 12:15 when we were asked if we wanted anything to drink. We ordered water for the table and one club soda. She then tells us that our waiter will be right with us to take our order. 12:30 rolls around and still no waiter, but we finally received our drinks! Amazing! BUT no club soda. Had to wait another 10 minutes for it. 12:35 and low and behold we have a waiter!! I've worked in the restaurant business before and you are supposed to greet your customers no longer than a minute after being seated. I think we were very patient (though we thought about getting up to leave) despite the fact that we had to get out of there by 1:30 to catch a flight. We finally placed our order and didn't receive our food till 1:00! How ridiculous! The place wasn't even crowded and I do not know what our waiter was doing. I'm sure he's a nice guy and all, but I don't think waiting tables should be on his resume. TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE!   I spoke to the manager after we finished eating (in a rush) and she agreed that you should be greeted within 1 minute of sitting down and apologized. She then proceeded to tell me that there was a delay because of the food allergy at our table and they wanted to be extra cautious. I again told her that that wasn't the issue because we couldn't even get someone to take our order for the longest time! Plus the 3 other tables around us had to wait 20-30 minutes for their food after ordering too and I know they didn't have food allergies at their table. Excuses...  She took off one of our entrees and the drinks (the one club soda) from our bill. I don't think it was worth the time or the money. For the price and time spent, we could have and should have just went across the hall to The Buffet. I expected way more from Wynn. Very disappointing and won't be going back.",

    "text": "THANK GOD for Terrace Pointe Cafe and the ability to sit at the bar.  We stayed at the Wynn for the first time, and on both Saturday and Sunday, we visited this place to have a solid meal, the ability to watch the Olympics on TV, in air conditioning, and without having to wait in the extensive line for a table.  The terrace part of the restaurant looked nice, but to be honest, at 11am on a Vegas sunny day, this really didn't appeal to me.  We were given the bar option, since a table would mean we'd have to wait for about 20 minutes.  After sitting down, we both ordered the sangrias from Peggy the bartender, and put in orders for strawberry pancakes (Greg) and Bacon Avocado Omelette (me).  The drinks came up pretty quick, and when the food arrived it looked heavenly.  Bacon, avocado, and eggs are my favorite combo in an omelette, and when I cut into it, the whole thing was spilling out bacon bits (held off on the cheese that comes with it).  The whole thing was completely delicious and I had just enough room to sample some of Greg's pancakes.  As someone who typically avoids heavy breakfast, I would consider ordering this next time.  Those pancakes were outstanding and even baked in the strawberries rather than using it as a garnish.  The second day we came here, we had lunch since breakfast was over.  Greg had the BBQ Bacon Burger and I had the lunch combo with the Asian Chicken Salad, BLT, and a side of potato chips.  Out all of the items, I thought the salad was the best.  The BLT was the perfect combo size, and I really didn't need the chips but it was nice to have the option.  I opted for a mimosa and Greg had a mojito.  Again, another solid meal at Terrace Pointe.  Greg and I are expecting to try and come back and stay at the Wynn, and we'll definitely be stopping back in to Terrance Pointe!",

I wanted to come here on some previous trips because of some relatively good reviews of this place but never got a chance until I stumbled across this while visiting the gorgeous pool at the Wynn.   This place has an awesome outdoor seating area that faces the Wynn gardens and pool area so you get a great view. The outdoor side is nice and heated at night in the winter time although the cafe closes at 5 pm. They serve brunch all day and breakfast items in the morning. They have creative decor and relatively good service but the food is delicious! I was amazed that it was reasonably priced for being in the Wynn as I was expecting some outrageous prices. My brunch platter of omelette and toast was only $13 which honestly is pretty good for a place of this caliber.   I enjoyed the view, the service and their cocktails were yummy as well. I love it!",

It was actual corned beef chunks of meat.  I was not impressed witht the hash brown.  It was too undercooked in the middle.  The pancakes were tasty but a little too heavy.  Our friend ordered a blueberry muffin with his breakfast and he said it was not as good as Marie Callendar's muffins.

Used to be 24 hours, but now only into late night I believe. I have always been a fan. You can get everything from a burger and fries to a Vegetarian menu option of a burger and fries. I have had their 'veggie burger' and fries served with a cashew milk-chocolate shake and really enjoyed it.   it's comfortable, and clean, and the food is made well and tastes good. Sure it's not your most typically priced 24 hour, but you are on a 5 star property and the food is comparable to the price point. That being said, it's usually about $40 each when I have dined at Terrace Point, but we have a few drinks, appetizers, dinner.. it's all good and not too much more than I would spend at any other cafe around Vegas.   Th atmosphere is relaxed with comfortable seating and they have good food and a full bar. For that I'm In! Check it out!",

    "text": "Vegan burger and fries with a vegan milkshake???  I want!!!  The Wynn has proven to be among one of the best places in Vegas for vegans to enjoy both fine and casual dining at one of its many restaurants, Terrace Point Cafe at the Wynn did not disappoint.  My first recommendation is to request outdoor seating on the patio, how relaxing!  Once seated, request the vegan menu if you're vegan, there are several options for you.  I began my meal with the most amazing appetizer I've had veganized in my life, the spinach artichoke dip - oh how I've missed this dip!  I would say that the dip alone is worth 5 stars and had I known how amazing it was I would have ordered two (and...um...possibly three...it's OK to be a little piggy on vacation, right???) in lieu of an entree.  Then came my much anticipated vegan burger, fries, and milkshake.  I think I mostly enjoyed the novelty of it more than anything, I mean it's pretty rare to get a vegan burger, fries, AND a milkshake anywhere - it even came in a box reminiscent of a fast-food meal.  But overall, I felt the burger was a little boring, it wouldn't hurt if they updated it as I'm sure one of their fancy-pants chefs could come up with something unique/interesting.  The milkshake was made with coconut milk and would have been better off having been made with soy or almond milk as the coconut flavor was overpowering.  So as far as the burger and fries, I don't regret ordering the entree as I enjoyed the novelty of it, however I wouldn't order it again unless they update the burger.  Overall we had a great time, great atmosphere, and pretty fantastic spinach and artichoke dip!",

The hollandaise sauce was good and overall it was just ok for an eggs benedict connoisseur like myself.  Once you add in the pricetag of $60 for people for breakfast it made it not worth it.

The waffle was very good, and they did not skimp on the portion size.  The fried chicken breast was light, moist, and crispy; they added some cornflakes to the breading to give it an extra crunch.  The spiced maple syrup was good and went well with the salty entree, although I would have just preferred traditional maple syrup.     My friend ordered an angus bbq bacon cheeseburger which came out delicious.  The burger was loaded with plenty of cheddar and grilled onions, crispy bacon, and served on a nice onion roll.  The burger looked amazing and tasted just as good as it looks.  We also ordered a fruit plate, which came with a mini muffin.  The fruit was fresh and delicious, the mini muffin was way too small IMO, but for $15 it was a tad pricey for fruit.  Overall a good place for a quite bite and it sure beats the buffet line wait next door!  My only complain was the weird looks our server kept giving us for no reason, and the slightly slow service.",

The dinner was not as impressive. Think mediocre entrees and sandwiches you can get at any ol' deli for half the price. My tuna salad sandwich came with a very thin layer of tuna. What happened to the extravagance that the Wynn is suppose to effuse?! It's not found in their tuna! The food also took forever and a day to come out.",

The waffles had bits of bacon and scallions BAKED INTO THEM! Oh wow. So delicious. The second day I got to sit and have a gorgeous view of the pool. Of course it's pricey, but well worth it in my opinion due to the quality of the food and level of service.",

I doubt she would be rude to the VIP players .  It was just so disappointing and now that Mr. Wynn is no longer affiliated I'm guessing this is what will be .",

What a wonderful place to wonder what my life would've been like had I known what I wanted to do with my life at the age of 8, put my plan into action at 13 & had then done so well in high school that I was accepted into a college so prestigious that I was able to secure a high paying job right after graduation. If only, if only.   For those of us unable to afford the luxurious accommodations that the Wynn provides, eating at their restaurants comes as the next best option.   I was under the impression that such a grandiose establishment would therefore provide a red carpet experience equipped with only the best wait staff & recipes with ingredients fit to kill. Man oh man, was I wrong.   The terrace cafe is a beautiful brunch spot with an outdoor area that makes you feel like a queen despite your annual income, but this exhausts the list of good things I have to say about this outdoor hot spot.   As queen, I banish server Nicole & her TCP burger from this kingdom. Off with their heads! (kidding)  But not really. Nicole was a terrible server.. which surprised me given that the Wynn has a very extensive application/interview process & typically does a great job at weeding out the men from the boys.   My mom & I came here on a Saturday morning and decided to split an entree.. the TCP burger with a side of sweet potatoe fries, along with a Pepsi & a vanilla latte. Besides the 15 minute wait time on our drinks, we were more then happy to sit & catch up on the terrace while we enjoyed our refreshments. Well 15 minutes turned to 30, & the 30 minute mark brought a neighboring 6 top table who continually had to keep grandma from putting salt and pepper in her juice. And then 30 minutes turned to 45 and 45 turned to an hour & grandma and the rest of the family got their food & here my mother and I, who together ordered ONE entree, are still empty handed & Nicole has not been seen or heard from.   Nicole, it is OKAY that you forgot to put in my order & it's OKAY that the order was messed up. Any mistake that happened is OKAY. What is not okay, is that you neglected to come over & inform us of the situation & let us know that our food would be out shortly & apologize for any inconvenience.   The burger itself was an overcooked, even burnt, hunk-a hunk-a burnin beef. Yuck! Thank sweet Buddah it's hard to mess up fries.   Next time I'll try my luck elsewhere.",

Not a typical sausage patty by any means.  And the smoked tomato hollandaise sauce on the crab cake Benedict was literally one of the best things I have ever eaten.  Can't believe this place only has 3.5 stars.  The food is amazing and the service was stellar.  Great food for the money!!!    The coffee was also excellent. My wife and daughter had the pancakes and eggs, and it was by far amazing scrambled eggs with an amazing pancake. Definitely one of the many hidden gems in the Vegas world for breakfast.  This place is worth the walk from center of town. Thank you for a great meal for my family !!!!!",

They gave us both the breakfast and lunch menu. There wasn't a long wait....my party of 4 got seated within 5 minutes. And we waited in line for about....2 minutes?  Three people got breakfast entrees while I opted for a lunch sandwich. I got the Smoked Turkey Panini with brie, spinach, bacon aioli on a perfectly toasted sourdough bread. Got my choice with a side of kettle cooked chips. That buttery goodness of that toasted sourdough bread...mmmm mmm!!! Everyone really enjoyed their entrees. Prices are kind of on the expensive side...Our check came out to be over $120+....keep in mind, this is for brunch too. Sooooo.....I guess if you can afford to stay at the Wynn/Encore, then a $100+ check for lunch wouldn't phase you...lol. But you know what? You're on vacation. Live a little. Have fun and eat to your hearts content. Definitely a good choice in casual dining at this place.",

Our servers ,Heather and Jose, were spot on as this restaurant always has amazing service and friendly staff!! We ordered the huevos rancheros, the side sauces were spicy and well crafted! And the presentation of all the dishes was beautiful and their flavors are divine!! The hubby had a beautiful burger, which if you want fries are another $5. And given the burger was like $18 or $19 that seemed a little chincy not to have fries but hey.... and I had the quinoa veggie bowl (which was a hot dish) on the vegan menu and it was amazing! Lots of quinoa and bean sprouts and all kinds of umptous goodies inside like shitake mushrooms, tofu,carrots and sweet peas! And the sauce oh my!! It has a ginger lemongrass sauce that was to die for!! And finally my friend had the Chinese chicken salad. Which True to form if they are good you eat it till you make yourself sick! Which she did!! Their food was delicious from the first to the last bite! So it's no cheap date but well worth going!!! Without booze the bill was like $100 plus tip for 4 of us! But as I said the food is really good and always well prepared! We go back all the time!!!",

FOOD- Definitely not what you might expect from the looks of the place inside and out. I always try something different each time I come here and its a hit or miss, the last time i went was 2 weeks ago and the steak omelet i received was a oily MESS! inedible and guaranteed a heart attack if i ate the whole thing! On the other hand, the biscuits with honey that they served us was INCREDIBLE, soft, hot, and delicious!  ATMOSPHERE- Definitely a classy feeling here, the outside balcony by the pool is very relaxing with a nice view, overall a very nice place.  SERVICE- The waiters here are friendly and attentive, quick to refill drinks and get anything else you might need.  PRICE- Actually not bad for being in one of the most expensive hotels in Vegas, moderately priced, at least for breakfast.  3/5",

Both were quite good and came in big portions! Coffee was great! Our hostess, Diana, was also very welcoming and polite! She gave us to go cups for coffee, which is a big plus if you're a coffee addict considering that the price for a cup of coffee is ~$5 in this area! It is a bit pricey, but that is too be expected at the Wynn. Overall, it was a great experience and I thought it was well worth the price. We would certainly come back!",

The four pancakes were huge - thick and large diameter.  Sadly the quality was only fair; they were heavy.  However, the link sausage was good: crispy, chewy skin, and juicy meat.  The bill: $20.  I returned to the scene of the crime during another trip.  It was four in the morning, I hadn't had dinner yet (playing craps can do that to you), and I was hungry.  I settled for French Toast that was decent: four large, thick slices of eggy bread, fried until brown.  This still wouldn't be my first choice for a place to eat, but it will do in a pinch.",

We were in semi-health-kick mode (read: \"want burger, let's balance it with a salad.\") The mini Kobe burgers with caramelized onions drained us $15 for 3 -- great flavor though. Salads are huge and can easily feed 2 people, but are plus-minus in content: The flank steak salad was tasty but chintzy with the beef. They also used cheaper iceberg lettuce; c'mon this is the WYNN! There should've been some nice greens in the salad, I would've paid more $$ for that. The higher quality, dark leafy greens -- all 4 sprigs of 'em -- were sitting as optional toppings on the edge of our Kobe burger plate.  Upsides: Beautiful, fresh decor; open 24 hours; great selection and presentations; the perfect example of upscale casual dining. Downsides: Above-average prices; tends to get crowded",

The service and decor makes you feel like you're in a fine dining setting even though its a cafe! =P The servers were very attentive and friendly and the food came out in good time.   The blue cheese potato chips are so tasty...its drizzled w/ truffle oil but they put just the right amount so its not overbearing. Since I ordered the BLT it came w/ chips or fries, but since we already had some blue cheese potato chips I opted for some cole slaw. My sis had the tuna nicoise salad and there was a substantial amount of ahi which was great b/c most places are pretty shiesty w/ that!! My madre had the steak wrap and my cousin had the mushroom swiss burger. Everyone was pretty satisfied w/ their orders and the portions are nice and filling!  Ooh I also had a bellini..the combination of the peach and champagne is so delicious!",

We opted for waiting the 5 minutes to miss the breakfast menu (ends at 11am) and get the lunch menu once I saw the kobe beef sliders on the lunch menu :-)   My husband and I were trying to \"keep it  light\" after gorging at Del Frisco's Steak House for dinner the night before.  Riiight...so we just ordered some apps and split them.    We had the kobe beef sliders - which were amazing.  I think I could eat 3 orders myself.  Then the coconut shrimp and the asian chicken lettuce wraps (nothing like at PF Chang's or Chinoix but good.)  They also had Bellinis on the menu which instantly makes the place a favorite as they made them right (unlike most places) - almost to Cipriani perfection.   Service was great.  The waiter was always there when needed but not obtrusive.  This is a great place to walk up to after lounging in the sun by the pool.  Cost is..well...its The Wynn so deal with it.",

    "text": "The best 24-hour cafe in a vegas casino on the strip. The food is pretty awesome, decently priced, and the setting is what you expect from the Wynn.  The food here is breakfast and lunch fare. I really like the Tandoori chicken wrap and the greek salad. They pull both of those off very well. Every friend I bring here ends up leaving satisfied with the food. None of it is mind-blowing, but its solid, reliable, quasi-gourmet.   But the best thing about this place is that YOU (yes...YOU!) can afford to eat at the Wynn! ...if you eat here. Granted, everything is about $3 over-priced, but you pay for the surroundings, which are Wynn-tastic.  If you sit indoors, you sit on faux-french chairs or couches, surrounded by fancy colored drapes and lighting which are familiar to the entire interior of the casino. But the real winner here is if you can eat outside on the patio. There, you sit directly beneath (and in the shade provided by)  the behemoth Wynn tower overlooking the pool area. And at the Wynn, the pool area is really worth seeing (even if you can't stay there). The table umbrellas even have misters on the corners to keep you cool when it's 108 degrees outside.",

    "text": "The bossman recommended their kobe beef sliders, so of course, after walking from our room at the Palazzo all the way to MGM the plan was to swing around the other side of the strip and end up at Wynn for a fabulous quick dinner before our 7 PM Phantom showing at the Venetian.  However, we got caught in a freak thunder storm while at the Monte Carlo, and being cheapasses, we tried to wait out the storm by gambling (heh heh).  But being constantly hungry, my tummy couldn't take the abuse anymore (and I couldn't bear the thought of walking 2 miles in the rain without an umbrella) we finally waved down a cab and made our way to the Wynn.  I got the turkey burger, and our stint at BOA made my friend crazy about truffle oil chips, so he got their bleu cheese ones.  He also ordered the kobe beef sliders as his meal (he drank his fill at the various blackjack tables we visited while casino hopping hehe).  Bleu cheese truffle chips: Pretty good, but not as good as BOA.  The bleu cheese wasn't as pungent and salty as the kinds that go in my salads, so that was a good thing.  Some of the chips were also soft. . .bad.  Turkey burger: The spices in the turkey patty were a little strange. . .I wasn't a big fan of it. But the sauteed mushrooms and cheese and the toasted buttery cheesy topped bread was damn fine. The fries were also thinly cut, crispy and very good.    Kobe beef sliders:  Not nearly enough meat and all bread!!!  The bread was very tasty though, and the caramelized onions added a hint of sweetness to the mini burgers.  The bbq dipping sauce for it was awesome. . .my bf dipped his fries in it, and I just dunked my entire slider in it hehe.  Yum, pretty good, it filled us up pretty well.  The portions are gigantic here!",

    "text": "We came here a couple of times during our stay and I think it's a solid choice if you don't want to drop the cash for a fancy place like Daniel Boulud. Still a bit expensive, like everything at the Wynn, but we enjoyed everything we ate, the portions were large, and it's open 24 hours.   Food (4 stars):  I was a bit leery of the Teriyaki chicken sandwich--I mean don't all those \"teriyaki\" sandwiches taste pretty much the same? But this one was good! The chicken was tender, the sauce wasn't sickly sweet or overpowering, and the bun was hearty. It was a good sandwich. I usually only eat half a sandwich when they are big, but it was so good I couldn't stop eating it. And it came with onion rings. Yea!  Other things we tried:   Spaghetti bolognese with garlic bread was really heavy on the meat but tasty. Salad (mixed greens or something simple like that) came with a flavorful vinaigrette. Grilled veggie pita with couscous was really good. Manhattan clam chowder was pretty good but a little salty. A cup was just enough. And the coffee was good.  Service (1 star):  I just have to say that the service we experienced in Las Vegas was pretty much across the board bad (or on the bad side of the spectrum). I thought Las Vegas was supposed to be a service-oriented town, but it's the worst service I've ever experienced. And I'm a pretty patient and undemanding person when it comes to service.   The times we went to the Terrace Pointe Cafe, service was slooow (even when not busy; slooooower when it was), the waiters would disappear after serving your food and you couldn't even spy one across the room to wave them down for a bit of ketchup or your bill. Personality-wise the waiters we got were courteous but either overworked/indifferent or somewhat snooty.  My advice: 1) Be prepared in advance for anything you might possibly need for your meal and ask for it all at once. 2) Keep an eye out for your waiter and when you are close to 3/4 done with your meal, flag him down for your check and any take-home boxes you might need even if you plan to stay a bit longer over dessert and coffee.   Laugh now, thank me later...",

The Wynn Burger comes with lettuce, tomato and your selection of cheese. I got it with pepperjack it gave it a nice little kick. The burger comes on a nicely toasted seasame bun.

I ended up peeling off some of the batter, to reveal a very thin zucchini.  I didn't finish that either.    We had dessert, and when the bill came, it was over $100.00.  For lunch!!

I highly recommend the following from the vegetarian menu (all items are vegan):  Meals: - Wynn burger set w/ chocolate coconut shake (favorite!) - \"Chicken\" and waffles - French Toast - Vegan \"Tuna\" Salad Sandwich - Caesar Salad w/ Gardein \"Chicken\"  Drinks: - Sunrise juice (fresh) - Immunity booster juice (fresh)  A bit pricey except for the burger set ($9), but totally worth it! Nice view and service, too.  Definitely coming back.",

    "text": "I previously had a pretty good experience here, but my Saturday brunch last weekend blew that out of the water! VEGAN CHICKEN AND WAFFLES, SON! And how!  Wow.  I was just super impressed by the super crunchy crispy fried Gardein \"chicken\" and by the just-the-right-amount of crispness and puffiness of the scallion waffle.  And the two together? Heaven.  At $20 it probably should be, amirite? but totes worth it.   The BF got vegan French toast, which was good; but meh- I've never really gone gaga for French toast.  The Gardein sausage was also super good (serving = two large patties, $4).  The homefries ($4) were tasty but a little cold and hard.  Rivaling my astounding entree was the VEGAN brownie brulee banana split.  W. T. F. ?? Imagine caramelized bananas with housemade chocolate vegan ice cream, caramel sauce and crispy rice crunchy bits all over a decadent brownie.  Now tell me you don't have a tummy boner for that?!  This is the kind of dessert that  could end relationships if someone takes more than their share; but fortunately, the BF knows his place.     Service was a little slow, but otherwise a lovely experience.   The Wynn organization continues to impress me with their vegan options, and I will continue to pay way too much money for brunch when the food is this good.",

    "text": "The actual terrace is a must when looking for an easy lunch spot while in the Wynn Hotel. This affordable and casual elegant location is prime for al fresco dining and beautiful people watching, especially since it's on a small terrace facing the main pool. For those afraid of the Las Vegas sun, there are plenty of umbrellas to keep you from getting sun damaged. We all know that it can be challenging at times to find a restaurant in a casino that has a lot of natural lighting in Las Vegas, so this is an excellent option to take for a short break from all of the noisy slot machines and second hand smoke that you encounter while being stuck indoors.   The main dining room is not pretentious, but very inviting. The terrace is where al fresco fans will be most satisfied. Although the food was quite average for a Wynn caliber hotel, it was good enough to \"hit the spot\", help nurse that hangover and for the health conscious diners. The portions are large like your standard Cheesecake Factory dishes and fulfilling. On top of that, the service was mediocre. Everyone's food averaged over 30 minutes to prepare, while the staff apologized in a robotic tone at least 3 times regarding the delay.     I'd imagine on any given weekend during lunch many patrons are either already inebriated or recovering from a massive hangover from the night before. I sure was, so my taste buds may have been a little shot during my dining experience. However, I still have to rate the Terrace Pointe Cafe a three, since I expected so much more from the Wynn Hotel's restaurant service and kitchen. Luckily, I was more forgiving and let the outdoor ambiance influence me more than our dining experience.",

Let's just remember this place is considered \"cheap\" for Wynn standards.  The food is great.  Portions are large and the presentation often makes patrons forget they're eating at a diner.  I've been here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner with great experiences each time.  The service was stellar and was as classy as the food.  Though the decor is a tad on the cheesy side, the awesome views of the pools near the windows make up for it during the day time.  I have not ever had a bill for less than $100 here, and that is dining with 3-4 people at a time.  It's more than likely during my next extended stay at the Wynn will result in another visit to this lovely cafe.",

If you are looking for a GREAT food option, you've also hit the jackpot!  Food selection and quality is great. Breakfast, lunch, vegan, and most importantly for my family, gluten free. If you have a food allergy in your party, the chef comes to your table to ask about the allergy and walk you through the ingredients. It is absolutely wonderful and gives you great peace of mind. We really pretty much loved everything we ate here during our 5-day stay at the Wynn.  The ONLY reason I gave this 4-stars out of the 5 is because of service.   While the chef coming to your table is wonderful, we found the servers and hostesses to be borderline rude. Our first trip here, both the host and the waiter were so cold I couldn't believe it. In terms of the hostesses, maybe it's the awful, horribly-fitted pink uniforms they have to wear (I would be miserable if I had to wear that thing too!). On our last visit to the restaurant, we had to wait 15 minutes for someone to even come to our table to take our order. Ironically, the waitress that came profusely apologized (she hadn't seen us sitting in our kind of hidden section of the restaurant) and she was very very friendly the rest of our visit. She could have taught something to the 2 other put-out waiters we had the previous visits!  Overall, go here for the food because it is GREAT, just know that the service is a work in progress. Unfortunately, the prices make that a painful pill to swallow.",

I'd dined here before years ago and remember the food being good, so I was happy to confirm once again that it is.  We were seated promptly in one of their nice, comfortable booths.  Though we were given water right away, it did take awhile for our waitress to come by to take our orders.  She did see frazzled and we had pretty slow service overall, but the food was good, so I can overlook the slow service a bit.  For lunch I had a lemonade and the chicken club wrap with fries.  I know it sounds ordinary, but honestly it was so good.  The lemonade was perfect and the wrap had gouda cheese that was awesome.  I don't know what it is, but I love it.  The Hubs had the BLT and also enjoyed it quite a bit.  It's pretty simple, if we are at the Wynn and want a nice, relatively inexpensive lunch, I would definitely consider Terrance Pointe Cafe.

It was already 2pm in the day and I knew I had to get some sort of grub. I also chose this spot because my good pal, Lilli S. frequents it and always recommends the lobster benedict.   The lobster benedict was the only thing on my mind when it came to ordering. Not only because Lilli recommends it but because she has legit taste so it was a no brainer. Although, I didn't initially enjoy it much (refer to above paragraph), I did enjoy it later for a late night snack. They definitely do not hold back on the lobster. Since I'm a ketchup addict, I doused it with the good ol' Heinz 57 (Guch would disagree).  Across the way is Wynn's buffet, so if you don't feel like pigging out then Terrace Point Cafe is an available close option. The service was good and the atmosphere & setting is obviously classy. For some odd reason there were a lot of single-sitting women around me. Their counterparts were probably at a convention or blowing away the kid's college funds elsewhere.  In conclusion, a solid 3 star on my only entree' and my overall half-conscious experience here.",

The menu had an interesting variety of selections, but the food didn't taste outstandingly exotic. Just your basic American breakfast with a twist here or there. Service was solid and we were seated fairly quickly (although I noticed a growing line right around the peak time for brunch).",

Same as \"your order will be right out\" meaning \"I have not even put your order into the kitchen yet.\"  It took 35 minutes to get our food after we ordered it and the food was not that impressive.  My omelette was subpar, the hashbrowns were inedible and the french toast tasted almost burnt.  However, the black angus burger was delicious and after tasting my husband's burger I knew I made a mistake in ordering.  Don't go here if you are in a hurry and sit outside if the weather is nice so that at least the atmosphere will make up for the crappy service and mediocre food.",

When we sat down, the waiter arrived and served us our drinks right away.  Here is where the problems started occurring . We waited 20 minutes for the server to come to place our order.  By the time I had placed my order, I was full off of the OJ.  Once I ordered, I waited another 25 minutes for my food to come out.  I had ordered the New York Steak and it was cooked inside correctly, but unfortunately, it was cold.  The plate was hotter than the steak.  My sides were horrendous as they were bland and cold as well.  I don't think I'll be eating here again. By the way, I'm not that hard to please as I spent the weekend eating Nathan's Hot Dogs and Panda Express.  That should testify how bad the food/service here was!",

Everything was out at once in under a few minutes. Although I had already eaten before coming to the hotel, I still managed to get through half of my chicken quesadilla. The pineapple mojito I ordered was pretty good too. I got frustrated trying to poke at the pineapple chunks with my straw because I couldn't get any of them.

The latter was by far my favorite menu item, although they were all top notch.

I've been a fan of Steve Wynn's Hotels since I turned 21 and before he sold Bellagio, it was my place to stay in Vegas and one of the reasons was the good food, especially in the cafe.  They have the best Steak and Eggs, always cooked to perfection. With that said, I was really looking forward to brunch at this cafe, I thought it would be as good if not better.  I was to be proved wrong.  So here's what went wrong,  the food took a long time to come, the steak was overcooked, the eggs were overcooked, the potatoes were raw, I asked for new pototoes, hasbrowns this time, they came as a block, like a brick of hasbrowns and it was burnt and dry, the toast was only toasted on one side. My friends dish was bad too, though I can't remember what she got.  We were virtually ignored after we got our food.  The only saving grace was the french onion soup my friend shared with me.   I'm going back to Vegas next week for a wedding and you better believe I won't be eating at the Wynn again!",

I dined with a colleague and we split an order of guacamole (delicious) and both got the carne asada tacos. They were PHENOMENAL. A welcome surprise, for sure.  Each order actually came with additional guacamole and chips, which kind of negated our guacamole appetizer, but that wasn't mentioned on the menu. I would have been fine (and full) with the three tacos and their side of guacamole.  We needed to be in and out quickly, and our server was helpful in accommodating.

Something to note is that they have a dress code (for girls: no sheer tops/bare midriffs, guys need sleeves), but they allow you to sit outside if you're not dressed to their standards.  We went with a rather large group and shared a bunch of items so that we would be able to try more things. The service was pretty slow, it took a while for our waitress to show up, and it took an excessively long amount of time for our food to show up.  Salmon Benedict: special of the day and it was okay. Nothing too special. Short Stack Pancakes: very fluffy! Chicken and Waffles: it's pretty amazing. You gotta cut into all the layers because only the bottom waffle has bacon in the waffle! YUM! It also comes with a spicy syrup, but you can get it on the side if you're not a big fan of spicy. Corned Beef Hash: In general I'm not a big fan of corned beef hash, but the boys all loved it. The eggs came out wrong on our order, so we had them recook eggs for us.  Avocado Bacon Omelet: also nothing special I think my favorite thing about this meal had to have been the potatoes. They are freakin' delicious and I just couldn't get enough. They were like chips except crunchy on the outside and still chewy on the inside. I could probably get a side order of those potatoes for myself and just eat that as my meal! I may be a bit bias though because I have a bit of a potato obsession. All in all, even though the service was slow, I would come back again, not only for the potatoes, but because I want to get my hands on some of those red velvet pancakes!",

Disappointed at the very least considering at $18 and no side was included, ordered chips, thought couldn't cost much...$4 for less than what would come in a Lay's vending machine bag.

(And it would have) Furthermore, the menu option for unlimited cocktails is in fact not unlimited. They cut you off whenever they deem fit and Falsely keep you thinking that they should be out shortly.  This establishment is respectable and therefore I would expect their staff to be respectful of its guests.

I got the Benedict trio and a side of skillet potatoes.  First off the skillet potatoes are basically thick...not quite crispy, not quite tender potato chips.  Not at all what I wanted or expected.  The pork belly Benedict was horrible.  I literally checked if there was blood in my mouth because it tasted so metallic and just like blood.  So gross.  The traditional Benedict was better but I can make it better myself at home.  The crab was the best one and it wasn't even that great.  The crabcake was soggy.  The hollandaise had no flavor.  The egg wasn't even poached correctly.  Just not great at all.    My husband got the LEO which is lox, eggs scrambled and a bagel with dill cream cheese.  Think he was expecting the traditional locks with a bagel and capers and onions as it stated on the menu but this came like a sandwich with the egg and everything on the bagel.  He also ordered a blueberry muffin and he said that was the best part.  Just eh, not worth the money.",

The weird thing is that we did not get the food until 11:00 am, which was more like lunch by now, but the worst part of it, is it screwed all our plan for the day, as we had lots of things to see with my family, we ended up cancelling going to the Circus Circus for my son because of that. When exclaiming about our foos, the answer was always \"it will be here soon\". At the end, the waiter appologizzed and said the kitchen is over whelmed... If you can not afford to serve in a place like the Strip in Vegas, get the hell out of this business. Will never visit again",

I loved the outdoor patio with the great view of the pool but the food was pretty subpar. I tried the Brioche French Toast with Cap'N Crunch crusted toppings (other choices were Frosted Flakes or granola topping). The french toast was actually super dry and not very appetizing. I only took a few bites and couldn't eat the rest. I also tried a few bites of the bacon and avocado omelette which was a lot better than the french toast, but nothing amazing. Very standard and way overpriced.   The worst part about this meal was all the birds!! Lots of nasty dirty looking black birds and pigeons kept coming near us, and eating food off of abandoned tables. We even saw a bird drinking out of the little pitcher of cream that they give to people with coffee. GROSSSSS. We told our server about it and apparently it happens all the time. I sure hope they replace the cream.   Basically, there were things I really liked and really disliked about this place. The good: location, ambience, service The bad: most of the food, the birds",

This was our second time staying here and definitely not our last.  We love this restaurant! Our pool days always start with bottomless mimosas and brunch at the Terrace Pointe Cafe! We like to sit outside next to the pool so we can enjoy the sun. I had the Ahi Poke to start and it was amazing, the fish is so fresh and the taro chips are so light! For entrees I had a tuna sandwich on a huge croissant and my boyfriend had breakfast. We have never ever been disappointed eating here. The service was also impeccable as well; servers and assistants are full of personality and they entertained us the whole time.  The Terrace Pointe Cafe is a great casual dinning experience for The Wynn. They also have fantastic options for people looking for a more upscale experience. So keep in mind this is more for a nice pool side casual experience.     We will definitely be back!",

Most of the time a section of the restaurant is closed off too making the wait all the more frustrating.   Overall- eggs and potato cake are good but will I come back?

Portuguese sausage was spicey and tasted good, given the side of eggs had no salt, it was a good option. The Pancake was delicious until I got to a sour part. I think may be it was due to poor mixed batter, like flour or baking powder in a clump.  Sitting outside is a great option. Food gets delivered so fast. Such a big restaurant.

    "text": "Big selection of brunch items, including a separate menu for our vegan friends. My most recent visit was on a three-day weekend with a big group of girls for a Sunday brunch and surprisingly we did not have to wait for a table for long. I ordered the huevos rancheros  substituting for the vegan sausage. While the side sauces help the flavor, I was not a big fan of the dish. I tried a friend's French toast and that was amazing for those with a sweet tooth.  My previous experiences were better although I don't remember what I ordered. They also have a big selection of fresh squeezed juices and other fruit smoothies.    The service this time was a little slow but I cannot blame them because there was a group of 15 of us. Naturally it is harder to handle.   Love the decor inside,  and love the terrace seating outside.",

He told our waitress she just walked away and sent the bill. I wanted her to apologize and let the kitchen manager know i did mot expect it removed it from the check 25$ wont make rich or poor. And overall restaurant waiters at Wynn and Encore are mean not professional at all!  Whoever orders check in-front of the waiter before eating!",

Still expect to pay $$$ for food and drinks but in return, you're receiving the Wynn 5 Star experience. From the moment you're arrived you're acknowledged right away. The decor and music give this cafe a relaxing atmosphere. It almost takes away the feeling when you have lost lots in the casino and just want to get away.  Service was spot on! I ordered the steak and eggs and orange juice. Let's just say the price of orange juice is enough to buy a 2 pack - 2 gallon of orange juice at Costco. It's that pricey here. The steak and eggs was just ok, my server would constantly check to see how everything was going. It's nice to see they have a restroom in their cafe without me walking out towards the casino. Once in a while it feels good get experience eating at the Terrace Pointe Cafe. Steve Wynn really outdid himself this time.",

If the weather is nice, I definitely recommend sitting out by the pool!  It's pretty relaxing out there, but make sure to slather on some sunblock as some tables are not shaded by the sun all that much.    On both visits, I ordered their watermelon juice and Greek yogurt with granola and berries.  As for main entrees, one time I ordered their three egg breakfast with scrambled egg whites, potatoes, and sausage; the other time I ordered just scrambled egg whites.  I liked all my food, but maybe not my sausage and it could have been because I was trying to be healthier with chicken apple sausage, which usually isn't as tasty as regular sausage.    In short, four stars for Terrace Pointe Cafe because it is a solid spot for breakfast and the ambiance is nice especially out by the pool :)",

I came here 4 times for breakfast and once for brunch/lunch and I am a little a disappointed with the service. Wynn usually has the most impeccable service and extraordinaire plates of food to leave feeling happy but this trip saddened me !   The food was amazing as always so the cooks in the kitchen still have their skills but we waited relatively long for a server and food 3/4 times that I've visited.  I did have Zach and Jeffrey (I think his name. Tall with dark hair) and they were both SO SO SO nice !! I didn't have any issues with their service and were really just a pleasure to have. Thank you !  Of course, I had chicken and waffles EVERYTIME I came haha. It's just so frickin good ! The yogurt with coconut and pineapple is good too ! The Ginger cucumber drink is really refreshing too !   Will be back in November so I'm hoping the service is better. Oh... the hostesses were all very nice and welcoming.",

The food always comes out at a reasonable time despite how busy it gets. Our favorite dishes are the yogurt parfait with granola and berries, the chicken and waffles, and of course the pastries (specifically the croissant and pain au chocolat).   They have a lot of vegan options for a lighter meal, and you're able to order eggs a la carts if you don't want to have the potatoes and choice of meat.   Will be here for breakfast every time I'm in Vegas.",

As to food, I'd highly recommend their French toast, smoked salmon with eggs and bagel, and crab meat Benedict. We loved all three dishes, no doubt!

    "text": "Definitely a cool spot to eat while you're taking a rest from the busy/hot Las Vegas adventures. It's location sits well inside the Wynn hotel and is located really close to the pool so you can go take a nice swim before/after your meals.  Price: Above average prices, but that's kind of what you expect when you eat at a top tier hotel/ at the strip. However, I always think I need to stay True to the fact that price matters especially onto upscale places such as these since I want to see something unique from other places, which it has here!  Service/Atmosphere: Our waitresses were both super nice and had an awesome attitude. Willingness and patience with my parents who still aren't the best of English speakers. I also enjoyed how this place was next to the hall where people were leaving/coming in and next to the pool. You can see a whole bunch of people and faces while sitting inside a nice/cool open space. Some seats also have some nice, comfortable couches to let you REALLY lounge and leisure while resting/waiting for food.  Food: Another place that seems really average compared to other places around this price point. All dishes were pretty much the same to other places. They definitely aren't memorable and is definitely bland. You can for sure find cheaper places with better food quality/taste.  The reason for the four stars is simply due to the fact that I enjoy the atmosphere and the variety of people you can see around you. You can also definitely relax here with the couch seats they offer for you and would be a great place to bring when socializing amongst your friends.",

The croissant was huge but had no much taste to it.  I've lived in Paris for over 2 decades so I am a little picky with my croissants; you might like them.    On the 2nd day I ordered their croissant French Toast with coffee; it was good.   My friends ordered eggs benedicts, omelette, ham, waffles and fresh squeezed orange juice.  They finished or swallowed should I say all of it while I was only half way with my croissant French toast!   I think it is fair to say they all love breakfast here :)   The service was very attentive, friendly and courteous.  Choose to sit outside to get out of the ac in the hotels & casinos and enjoy the fresh air, trees, flowers and sun - pleasant place for breakfast.",

    "text": "Great food and great service. Two things that are an absolute must above all else. After a business meeting at The Wynn, my husband and I needed some food before heading back to LA so we asked one of the local employees there and they suggested we try Terrace Pointe Cafe. The first thing I noticed about TPC was how whimsical and fun their restaurant was! Very Alice In Wonderland-esque.  We made it in time for brunch and were seated right away. Our server was very friendly and made sure that our every need was taken care of. I gotta say that the service here is a cut above the other hotel restaurants we've been to. And that has been the case for The Wynn as a whole. The food was albeit a little pricy for brunch (re: roughy $18-20 for a main dish) but the portions are hefty and you can tell that they use high quality ingredients so IMO, it was worth it.  I ordered the Smoked Salmon Bagel with veggies and it was delicious. They don't skimp on the Smoked salmon which is rare to find. I noticed they blast the AC here (as with most major Las Vegas hotels) so wear something warm if you get cold easily like me. Overall, we enjoyed our experience at TPC and would come back again when we return.",

Sitting under the nice umbrellas for shades is pretty but the birds to pee and poop on you while you are eating is disgusting. There are quite a lot of birds who are waiting to eat your leftover means they eat there, they poop there.   The food we ordered are very disappointing. Asian Chicken salad is mixed with old frozen and thawed cheap chicken breast. Its gamey and it doesn't taste like chicken at all. It's horrendous. I bet it's a gmo chicken. The fish tacos are bland and dry. I don't wonder why there are so many birds there because they enjoy the food!! We did not finish our food and just left. For a big nice casino like Wynn, the cafe food we ordered are a big disappointment.",

We were seated promptly & that's when the good service ended. Our waitress immediately asked us if we had decided yet- um, no, we literally just sat down. The next time she approached, same thing. When we were ready to order she was very rushed. I said to her I felt like she was rushing me- to which she quickly dismissed me, was defensive & said she wasn't and she actually had plenty of help today. Isn't the customer always right? When she left I confirmed with Canada that she was in fact being very pushy, right?! Yes, absolutely. And that's the last time we saw her until we needed our bill. She never checked on us, not once. Incredibly rude service.   Now onto the food. My eggs Benedict was good, standard fare, nothing special. Espressos were good. Canada has the granola, which was the highlight- would recommend the granola. Overall, would not return and would not recommend.",

Our server was very attentive and helpful. I had the eggs Benedict, which were delicious. The coffee was also surprisingly good (most of the time coffee served in restaurants is way too weak for me).  The reason for the missing star is the price. While it was good, it was not exactly worth what was being charged. I understand that it is a touristy city, so everything is pretty much overpriced, but $16 for one waffle is a bit much....",

(My other friends came another day and made the same request and received the same reaction.) She noted I was the first to request a vegan dish with a non-vegan alteration. So, non-vegans! You can have non vegan eggs!  She ordered the same Omelette and naturally had vegan eggs. We were both VERY happy with our breakfast. I read another review about the person being gluten free. I'm sure this would qualify as vegan gluten free. They did say it was new on the menu though.  We came back on a later date for the french toast. The french toast also tasted really good!

I ordered the juevos rancheros skillet and the other items on the table were steak and eggs and the bacon avocado omelet. Everything was tasty! They also have a drink menu with cocktails and smoothies. There were a few times throughout the meal that took awhile to get anyone's attention.

Everyone else ordered breakfast, I suggest you do the same! Got coffee but since I was ordering lunch, asked to change it to a coke and she charged me for both! The server rubbed me the wrong way, she was rude and pushy. The pancakes are so big and fluffy but watch out. They try to be cute and funny when asking you for sides of stuff to go with your food but never tell you it cost extra so got a bunch of sides at $8 a pop that I thought were included. For almost $20 pancakes, you'd expect basic toppings to be included but noppppe. Already knew going in his place is EXPENSIVE, but dang, next time warn a brother when you offer sides of the price. Would have never ordered whipped cream or Nutella if I knew they were $8 each! Overall, first time experience was great. Good for one time or if you got money to burn. Oh yea, the coffee is pretty amazing too. Almost orgasmic!",

It was about a 15min wait for an outdoor table on a gorgeous sunshiny day (and trust me, esp coming from the UK, you want an outdoor table!). We both indulged in a chicken and waffles feed, and I enjoyed mixing both the sweet and spicy sauces (finger-licking good mmm) while the waffles were nice and fluffy. We also opted for the bottomless mimosas (I blame the mister) even though we didn't actually have that long to linger, on the very logical basis that the refillable option was the same price as ordering two, so we swiftly got to our third glass each and felt like we were totally winning at life ;) What sealed the 5-star deal though was the service - we started with a guy who had us laughing out loud enough to upsell us the mimosa refills (not that we took any convincing in our newlywed bliss) and finished with a different server - but both on-the-ball and total sweethearts.  Highly recommend if you're staying at Wynn and don't want to queue for the buffet...",

Oh, he knows my weakness for hearty vegan brunches.  Terrace Pointe Cafe pulls out all the stops, and I had to resist ordering more than one entree.  I had the french toast that is, to date, the best french toast I've ever had.  I was a little wary that the batter had banana in it (such a hippie thing to do) but it worked!  After a few bites, I didn't even really taste the fruit, and was left with a perfect interpretation of eggy french toast, without the sadness.  Well done, Terrace Pointe!  I had originally made reservations for Tableau, but when the rest of our party dropped out at the last minute, and there were no reservations available for two people, we rolled the dice with Terrace Pointe and were so delighted.  We were seated within 10 minutes, without a reservation, and had a lovely seat by the window.  The attire for the wait staff is a little too \"Disneyland, Carnation Cafe,\" but I suppose they're just trying to create an atmosphere.  5 stars for the best french toast.  I'll probably be back for more soon.",

    "text": "It was breakfast time in Las Vegas. Breakfast is probably my favorite meal of the day. Not only is the first meal of the day, the meal that sets the tone for the whole day, but it includes everything delicious. Cheese, potatoes, eggs, bacon -- need I say more? I opted to sit outside as it was a nice day out. Terrace Point Cafe at the Wynn is nice inside, but the outside was too perfect to pass up. The open air was laden with trees, and had a great view of their pool. Eating breakfast here was just pleasant. The service was great, and the atmosphere was relaxing.  I ordered the the Omelet Trio. It consisted of 2 mini pancakes, hash browns, and an omelet. The interesting part was that the hash brown was the tastiest of the three -- it was the star of the dish. Maybe that's why they placed it in the middle. The omelet was normal, as were the pancakes. These hash browns were special. It was a triangle block, not the traditional diner style ones. I am a big fan of crispy, crunchy hash browns fried in butter. These though were kind of mushy and thick, almost cake like. That didn't matter. They were delicious!  The french toast ham sandwich was a first for me. Never have I had french toast as the bread of a sandwich. Open faced, all of the ingredients sat on top of the french toast. The sweet and salty aspect of the dish had be wanting more. I am not a fan of the crust on french toast, so I liked that they cut that part off. The eggs were cooked perfectly, and the ham with melted Swiss on top was great together. And of course, this dish came with a side of hash browns too. Score!  Nothing beats breakfast outside in Vegas adjacent to the pool at the Wynn. The Wynn in Vegas is beautiful -- Props to Steve Wynn. It might be one of my favorites properties. The design cues are timeless and classy. Sometimes, I feel themed Vegas resorts are so touristy sometimes. Keeping with the design and feel of the Wynn, Terrace Point Cafe fits in perfectly.",

Sat outside next to the busing tray. The birds knew just what to wait for. My husband asked if they could clear it away since the birds were buzzing his head to get to the leftover food, he was told sure. After another 10 minutes and watching the birds fly over and land on fresh water and the pitcher to refill glasses with so called fresh water I got up and went inside and spoke to the hostess. She said she would find someone (heard that before) and pointed me in the direction of the manager....which happened to be the person my husband spoke to. The manager covered up the food with napkins and more food proceeded to be put on top. FINALLY someone removed it and the whole dance started again. Wynn is suppose to be first class, not this restaurant, reminds me of seagulls attacking you at McDonalds on the boardwalk for fries. Someone needs to put a covered busing holder out there or get the staff to bus to the inside. I'm sure they can design a bird proof dirty dish cart or closet but looks like Wynn doesn't care. I've even been to outdoor dives that have better trash cans that deter birds. For a $100 breakfast for 3 I think they should be able to do better.   If you choose this place and sit outdoors stay away from the back by the busing table.",

I'm in Vegas for 4 days and as a Vegan, this poses a challenge with no kitchen, living on the strip. So, what do I do? I straight up binge on Terrace Pointe for late breakfast and hope it lasts me until dinner.  Tofu scramble was just as amazing as their chicken and waffles btw. It comes packed with a gracefully executed potato hash smothered in cilantro avocado sauce, over a black tortilla that was perfectly warmed and lightly crisped. I rarely think other's can do Vegan food better than me..until I met this place. Thank the GODS for Terrace Pointe Cafe...I'm going to cry in joyful vegan tears now...tears of relief and happiness that somewhere in the future, there will exist a day where all restaurants can rise up to this level of awareness and skill. Bravo Terrace! I'm hopeful you guys can figure out how to put the peanut butter shake on the vegan menu too... Cause that is too easy of an item to NOT make Vegan.",

    "text": "I'm in Vegas with my Mom for a few nights to have a little fun, eat some good meals, and see a show. We got 2 free tickets to the buffet, so knowing that we are going for an early lunch, I sought out a place to get a light breakfast for the two of us. First off, one of the security guys walking around the casino, kindly tells me about \"Terrace\" when I inquired about where to get a hot breakfast (it was around 6:45a). Then, as I'm walking around trying to find it, one of the dealers tells me it's not open yet. Huh? So as I'm contemplating leaving Wynn and where to go for light breakfast fare/coffee, I ask another gentleman who was walking by the tables, and he said, \"It SHOULD be open\" and proceeds to walk me over there... and indeed, it was open. Okay! So there is an unmanned bar where I need to place a To Go order, at which point the hostess calls the bar guy to come out. I ordered 2 bagels toasted with butter on the side, 1 coffee, and 1 tomato juice with lime and it comes to $22.17 - yikes! With a small tip, it was about $24. Bagels were just ok, kinda hard actually, but they did put in some little jars of strawberry jam which was nice. Basically, you are at the mercy of whatever is available in these casinos and you pay for the convenience of not having to stumble around outside like a hobo. Looking forward to the lunch buffet and dinner later at Phil's Steakhouse at TI.",

As a \"party of one\" the hostess suggested I might be most comfortable sitting at the bar, presumably because there was a wait for two-tops. I was in a hurry so I said ok.   I wanted a Benedict but the only two on the menu were a lobster version and one with pulled pork, so I passed. I ended up ordering a bagel and cream cheese and a Greek yogurt with berries and granola.   First there was some confusion among the bartenders about the bagel, which I wouldn't have known if they hadn't each asked me if the other was getting my bagel. Then when it came it was burned. It would have been crappy even if it weren't blackened - is this bagel seriously the best available in Las Vegas?  It has to be, right, because if there were a better bagel I would think Mr. Wynn would have found it, right?  The saving grace was the cream cheese, which was definitely not from a tub.   The yogurt with berries and granola was better but it was way too big, probably to justify the $14 price. Seriously, y'all?  For yogurt and a couple dozen berries?  It had blueberries, blackberries and strawberries over some bland yogurt - I asked for vanilla but I think I got plain.  The star of this dish was some seriously amazing granola, which I'm told they roast fresh every day.   High prices but with some nice elements and a pretty setting.  I'd go back.",

    "text": "Terrace Pointe is an underrated breakfast/brunch spot that probably receives low marks due to a somewhat high price point (compared to off-strip breakfast spots) and location in the Wynn which does nothing but raise expectations. But my visit with a friend a while back showed was filled with some good and great eats. The best of what I sampled was a brioche French toast retaining much of its batter to give it a cake-like texture and coated with Cap'n Crunch cereal to provide a crispy exterior. Topped off with a banana that was perfectly caramelized and bits of toffee and buttered pecans to counterbalance the soft bread, it all combined to make an excellent rendition of this breakfast staple.  The red velvet pancakes were another hit. Between each layer of the short stack of rich, cakey, and dense pancakes were layers of a vanilla cream glaze that make this the ultimate treat for anyone with a sweet tooth. If you want something more savory, try the Maine lobster benedict. I appreciated the light application of hollandaise -- just enough, with the perfect egg to butter ratio making it creamy and velvety. Bits of bacon dotted the interior of the light, crispy waffle and was topped with small chunks of lobster firm in texture. Another waffle dish -- the crispy fried chicken and waffles -- had similar crispy edged waffles and chicken with a crispy and crunchy exterior, if somewhat bland. It may not have been the best dish of the morning, but was good enough to satisfy.  You may be paying a premium because of the location, but the quality far exceeded my expectations. Wait times can be long during peak hours so its best to come before or after the rush. They also have patio seating overlooking their pool.",

Three out of four in our group had eggs, all prepared over-easy or sunny-side-up.  One egg came out with a broken, cooked egg yolk so we asked if they could provide another egg over-easy.  You'd think they'd catch this before bringing the food out.  They brought out two new eggs but the egg whites were way under-cooked - completely disgusting.    I had the Eggs Benedict.  They just weren't good at all.  Pretty tasteless.  We had eaten here once before and had a great meal, but I don't think we'll be returning.  Breakfast, in my opinion, is one of the easiest meals to not screw up, especially with a simple egg order.  I expect better when they're charging more than $15 for eggs.",

What a shame because it has so much potential and there is no excuse for such a mediocre execution at such an establishment.  I had the alfredo with shrimp and it resembled and tasted like a tv dinner!  I could have had better at The Olive Garden!  It was smothered with sundried tomatoes and mushrooms and was just bad-period.  My bf had the Philly cheesesteak and that too was a disaster.  How can you mess up a hot sandwich?  Th only decent thing we had was the salad caprese, which was actually good.  What a waste of $ and the nice pool view!",

This trip, we ate there twice over four days (Eggs Benedict and Raspberry French Toast for breakfast and then Sliders and Buffalo Chicken Dip for lunch). The Eggs Benedict didn't disappoint (they never do), and the Sliders and Buffalo Chicken dip were new discoveries. Delicious! We didn't have to wait in line for a table this trip -- the first time ever. My only complaint: they closed the terrace dining area due to a \"high wind advisory.\" The umbrellas weren't even billowing. What a crock. Dining is the best on their terrace overlooking the pool.",

    "text": "Stopped here for lunch while checking out the Wynn. It came recommended by the concierge as the best place to eat a casual lunch on the Wynn property. Indoor seating and outdoor poolside seating available.  Even though it was noon, we were attended to and seated quickly. The view is hard to beat...you can see the pool from just about every seat. The Wynn does have some of the best visual stimulation around...the waterfalls, the pool, the decor, and the environment is just great.  The burger and sandwich quality was excellent. The burgers are HUGE and flavorful. I had a southwest Angus burger with avocado and my friend had their BLT. You'll have to be hungry to eat the whole burger or sandwich...honestly. The hamburger buns are fresh made in house...they tell you but you can also tell with your first bite.  Their fries...eh...ok...disapointing to be totally honest. The basic fries are just that. and their steak fries, which I had, were over-seasoned beyond what I could handle. Hopefully just a mistake but it's just fries...they were pretty bad.  The milkshakes are what make the Terrace Point worth a trip. They serve triple thick shakes and they are worth every penny at $7 each. With 6+ flavors to choose from, I had their Vanilla and it was anything but your run-of-the-mill shake. Whip cream was fresh made, cherries were some of the best ever, and the shake size was ideal. I usually feel weighed down by shakes but not here.  Here's what we got...  Vanilla Milkshakes - $7 ea BLT - $12 Fries - $4 Southwest Burger - $17 Steak Fries - $4  Spend-o-meter: 55 for lunch...way up there IMHO for a cafe...worse considering the disappointing fries... Service: very good Value: eh...better places within a quick walk...Ceasars, the Venitian, and the Palazzo have much better cafe's and taqueria's for the same $$$. Will I go back? If I do, it will be for the shakes.  Overall, I expected a much better experience from the Wynn. I left not really wanting to go back...kinda sucks to feel that way over lunch as I'm sure the Wynn has much more to offer.",

This open 24/7 which is great on a not-so-24/7-Las-Vegas (except getting alcohol or casino, of course) The place is comfortable and the wait is almost non-existence (we came around 10:30PM?) Anyway, we got the Fried Shrimps with Spicy Hoisin Sauce as appetizer. It was good especially the sauce, however it was a bit pricey with only 3 shrimps on the plate.  I wanted lamp chop (for no apparent reason) but they didn't have it, however, they got Lamb Pita. My friend Jonas got the Prime Rib Wrap. Everything tasted like they were reheated even though the Prime Rib Wrap was till delicious! Service was decent as well. It is not a bad place to go for late night dinning at the Las Vegas strip.",

After missing our dinner reservations at Sinatra on a Saturday night we were looking for a place to eat.  After asking for one of the Wynn employees he suggested this place.    The place was in the process of closing and were the last folks they had that night.  Even though they were closing they never rushed us and the staff was extremely helpful and friendly.    This place would be awesome for breakfast or lunch as it overlooks the pool and very nice place with the natural light.  As for food and prices.  Prices were decent for Vegas pricing.  We had 4 people in our party and had 2 burgers, sliders, and steak, and bruschetta.  We split the tab between us it was $30.00 with tip each.  Quality of food was very good and worth the trip.  Again its not going to be the best food you have but, its very much worth it for casual dining.",

She didn't complain but he noticed her disappointed expression and added horseradish and Worcester sauce and kept mixing it until it was perfect. He was great! Once we were seated outside out experience only got better. The food was delicious and reasonably priced. The only complaint I have is the service. The wait staff (both times) wasn't friendly or attentive. We only saw them when they took our order and dropped our order off. We actually had to flag them down to get our check.

I had the lobster and crab sliders along with the tomato bisque soup. The sandwich had big chunks of meat with a light mayo sauce mixture. The one thing I didn't like about the sandwich though was the extra third bread they added. (To much bread) I tried my friend's steak salad to which everything came fresh and the steak being tender and seared to a pink finish. I also tried the spaghetti bolognese. Thinking it would just taste like any bolognese, I was surprised to how different it was and it was pretty damn good as well. And they didn't overcook the pasta. I recommend sitting on the patio for a relaxing experience but make sure you have your shades. I definitely will be going back!",

    "text": "The view is very pretty if you sent out on the patio. It's right by the Wynn's pool and I guess it could be kind of awkward watching people swim as you eat, but hey the view of the pool is pretty! The only bad thing is that there are these black birds flying over you and picking off the food leftover on the table.   What we got: Benedict Trio ($24): it was your choice of either pulled pork, lobster, and traditional. You could pick one of each or pick whatever of the 3 you wanted. I ended up getting one of each just so I could try them all. Eggs were cooked perfectly for each of them, once you cut into them, the yolk started flowing out. For the pulled pork...pork was kind of hard and chewy which made it hard to cut. Lobster was pretty good, but left a bad aftertaste. The traditional was bland and didn't have much flavor to it. The hollandaise sauce on it tasted bland too and didn't do the dish any justice.  Fried Chicken and Waffle ($20): I would have rather gotten this dish than any of the Benedicts. It came with a spicy maple syrup so it gave the waffle a nice kick to it with it being sweet and spicy. The chicken was perfectly fried and crunchy. I would totally get this dish again if I ever came back.  Service: I forgot our servers name, but she was nice. She didn't come all that often and there were other people taking care of us and getting us things that we needed.",

    "text": "7/4, 7/6/13  Breakfast  I made a point to not dine at the bland and pretentious Society Cafe at Encore again since my last visit to Vegas. Terrace Pointe is Wynn's counterpart (table service, higher end) minus all that Iron Chef hype. What I like most is the outdoor dining patio overlooking the Wynn pool. The dining room is very spacious with high ceiling and a full bar. They do have a strict dress code IN THE DINING ROOM: no tank top for men (which I brazenly perpetrated on an 115F day) and no sheer cover-up for ladies. I care less because I come for the patio.  We made two visits this 4th of July weekend for breakfast; both service and food were distinctive. Like I mentioned in my review of Peppermill Lounge, prices are steep in Vegas unlike you do the food court plastic tray thing. Terrace Pointe is actually very reasonable consider you can very good service in a fine decor.  *Oatmeal ($14): with sliced banana, raspberries, blackberries, walnuts, raisins all in separate mini cups. The perfect healthy option to begin the day. My companions also had mini morning buns.  *Brioche French Toast ($16): I surrendered to my long craving. This is some of the best French toast I've had. Dipped in egg and cinnamon batter, with candied walnuts, caramerlized banana and toffee brittle. The toffee is too sweet and is not my thing. I peeled off the caramel off my banana. French toast itself is excellent.   *Huevos Rancheros on Skillet ($17): fluffy scrambled egg on a bed of refried beans. I don't remember this item from last time. My companion said it was tasty.  *Pancakes and Eggs ($17): their pancakes are too thick to my preference, but crispy and not chewy. Bacons crispy and scrambled eggs are far better than Peppermill and other breakfast joints around the strip.   *Classic Breakfast ($17): three eggs any style, in my case scrambled, with bacon or sausage. Apple chicken sausage is better than Peppermill and Society Cafe. Potato are thinly sliced and roasted, almost like warm potato chips!  I notice this time that they no longer offer the Double Down Breakfast which allows you to choose any two breakfast items for $18. Inflation?  Overall verdict: The perfect breakfast spot if you want a relaxing, quiet, and beautiful environment with great service. That it's in the Wynn suggests the clientele is more polished. Sometimes I come in here and just read over coffee, which is served in a thermal, before I order food. They just leave me alone. It's my staple breakfast joint in Vegas.  They don't take reservation so get there early on holidays.",

The service was impeccable and my good buddy who was celebrating his birthday had made it a annual bday brunch spot for the last couple of years. He highly recommended the lobster benedict saying it had blown his mind the first time. I don't take his recommendations lightly either, he has a refined taste pallet hah.  We literally had half our party order lobster benedict expecting the world because it sure as hell sounded great. Upon receiving my dish I was starved and surely thought anything that tasted semi decent would satisfy me. Boy was I wrong. The egg was COOKED through and the yoke did not break and ooze out as a proper benedict should. The piece of bacon served on top and I quote from a friend tasted like \"ASS\". This is bacon we are talking about, how hard is it to mess up bacon!? Instead of a typical english muffin or some sort of bread the benedict was served on hash browns and the textures did not blend well at all. I could go on and on about how the dish conceptually and flavor wise went wrong. Bottom line it was a big FAIL.   We asked if the chef changed recently and the waiter confirmed that there was a change in the chef. Bring back the talent please.   The ambiance and service was great, but if you can't get the food right you could have ambiance and service for days and it won't matter at all.",

    "text": "Not the best place to dine at the Wynn. Casual and comfortable atmosphere. Although I arrived there at 4am for a \" night after drinking meal\", I was a littler disappointed. All I ordered  were eggs and a Belgium waffle.     The eggs were horrible! They literally tasted like someone whipped up half-and-half and cooked it. However, the waffle was so amazing my friend ate 1/2... leaving me to send back the eggs and order another waffle... which she ate another 1/2 of! I've heard good things of this spot... just wish they knew how to make eggs!",

    "text": "The decor here is really nice and the staff is run like a machine with walkie talkies and separate staff members whose sole job is just to bring you certain things. The prices are a little steep but not as high as I had expected.  I ordered the chicken madeira I believe and it was honestly just OKay. There seemed to be too much sauce that tasted much heavier than it should have. The gnocchi felt like dried up gummi worms and was not appetizing at all. My cousin and I were both in agreement that gnocchi should never taste like that.  I believe they charged me extra to substitute something in the order with asparagus, but I was glad I did because it was the best part of the meal. It was crunchy, not too much oil, not too soggy - perfect.   Everyone else's orders seemed to fair much better but the ice cream I had in the end was amazing and made up for the mediocre food earlier.   Since the prices are comparable I would say go to Cafe Society in the Encore instead unless you are specifically going to Terrace Pointe for the dessert.",

    "text": "Terrace Pointe Cafe is one of the better 24-hour hotel cafes on the Strip - to me the food has always been a notch above what's available at other hotels. I took away one star for service - depending on when you go the line can be long ever if there appears to be a number of tables open, and the wait for the food can be rather lengthy. A lot of people seem to stop here for one last meal before dashing off to the airport (not recommended) - and I've often seen people hurrying through meals and jumping up to try to chase down a server so they can get off to the taxi line.  I've also seen some rather tense exchanges between servers and customers over how long the process was taking.  Still, if you have the time this is a great place to eat - especially outside on the patio or if you go later at night when the crowds have thinned out. The line is almost always shorter than the Wynn Buffet line.",

Very rich and creamy.  :)  $8 bucks for a cup of soup.  WTH? The sandwich was good, but the $16 dollar price tag that came along with it was not.  Overall, food here is yummy, but for the price you are paying it is not worth it.  There are so many places to dine at in Vegas for far better prices.  If you have money to burn, then by all means, dine here. However,  my suggestion, Yelp around first  :)",

The wait is ridiculous for this place the weekend for lunch though. Don't even try to sit outside. It looks so pretty out there though. There is a pool and some fountains to look at.   There is a full bar also which is good, but what doesn't have a full bar in vegas?   I've also had the cobb salad, which was GIANT (You could totally share this with 3 people), the chili (so good), Turkey club (good), and a cheese burger(GIANT and yummy). The prices are high, but you get good quality food so I don't mind paying for it!",

    "text": "Unlike a lot of Vegas resorts' 24 hour option, this Cafe is bright, sunny and offers a broad selection of mainly American dishes. My stack of blueberry pancakes arrived with the server smiling--the stack was about five inches thick. I passed about 1/3 of the stack to my companion who, fortunately, was hungry even after his own bacon-egg-hash brown-toast plate. I also had a plate of bacon - quality.  Room service prices at the Wynn are pretty insane so on another day of my stay, I had lunch at the Terrace Point Cafe solo. The quantity options were pretty overwhelming so I ended up over-ordering. For an appetizer, I had pork pot stickers which I greatly enjoyed. My main was tomato bisque with \"mini\" grilled cheese. There was nothing mini about it though--instead the chef had cut a tradiitional sandwich into quarters. Tasty if not groundbreaking.",

We went to Stratta instead and there was no wait.  Another night we went by and there was no line, but there was still somehow a 20 minute wait.  (They weren't seating people in an entire half of the restaurant).  We walked away, then realized everywhere had a 20 minute wait, and came back.  Our main goal at this point was to find good food but we had someone picking us up in 45 minutes so it had to be fast too.    We went back to Terrace, and noticed the empty bar and asked if we could eat there...  Yes, we could ...  Why didn't the lazy hostess bother to tell us this to start with?   L a z y and wasted our time.  Had a good meal..  I had a chicken sandwich, with pesto on a nice grilled bread.  Brian had their steakhouse burger.   Food was great.  It was $70 for two entrees and 2 glasses of wine.  Though we were at the bar, the service was good.  Several people came in and ordered food from the bar \"to go\" ... A local came and said he thinks the petite filet is the greatest thing ever, he often goes and orders it 'to go' ... While we were seated, a few others came and ate at the bar as well..  It's a good option if you're wanting quick food that's really good.",

But I HAVE come here several times for lunch and dinner... and the food is GREAT. I've been hooked on one dish and one dish alone almost since I've started eating here. That dish is the Chinese Chicken Salad... the most AMAZING salad I have ever had. The sauce is fantastic and the ingredients to the salad are a perfect mix... water chestnuts, mandarian oranges, lettuce, sprouts... mmmmm.... and the sauce. OMG, I consider myself to be a proud meat eater... but DAMN this place has SUCH an amazing salad that the chicken is almost secondary. Altho it's certainly not bad. It's a big dish too so you can fill yourself up and hope that some of that alcohol swirling around gets absorbed before y'all binge again!  Oh, btw, the sliders are good too... just a little pricey.",

    "text": "I know this place has gotten a lot of bad reviews but I really liked the restaurant. Originally my sister and I were going to go to the Wynn for the breakfast buffet but we found out it was the Saturday brunch and not a regular buffet, so I remembered about Terrace Pointe and we headed there. Actually a lot of people ended up venturing over to Terrace Pointe because of the non-buffet.   From the time we walked into the restaurant to the time we sat at our table was about 10 min. which was great. The ambiance is nice, quaint and very \"Wynn\". The menu was short and sweet - pancakes, waffles, fruit, pastries, etc. I ordered the strawberry belgian waffle, my sister got pancakes. My waffle was great! So delicious - crispy, flavorful, the strawberries were fresh and the whipped cream was yummy. My sister's pancakes were huge, she couldn't even finish them.   The only minus is it took a good while for our food to come.  Luckily we weren't starving, because if we were I would have been a lil ticked off at having to wait so long. Overall I really liked my food, it was a great alternative to the breakfast buffet. I will definetly go back on my next trip to Las Vegas.",
