I told the waitress & she didn't say anything just went to tell the other waiters & they laughed.  I expected a little more since I'm always here.  I told the other waitress & all she said, \"yeah it happens sometimes.\"  That's crazy! Why don't they get it fixed. I'm glad I had washed my hands before my son.  The lack of acknowledgment or trying to make things right went out the door. I always recommend this place to everyone I know.  They only way I would come back is if management reached out to me.  Very disappointed.  Used to be my favorite place.",

    "text": "I came here for AYCE dinner because this restaurant averaged 5 stars after 71+/- reviews. We made a reservation for a party of 9 and was able to be seated on a very timely manner. The waiters and servers were friendly. There was also a very amusing manager or owner walking around yelling funny comments throughout the night. He definitely livened up the atmosphere. Their decor was nice too. They have these giant banners of pictures of the sushi chefs behind the bar. They're hilarious! Oh! And they also had a female sushi chef. I don't think I've ever seen one before so that was interesting.   The sushi itself was really good. I think this is one of my new favorite spots for AYCE sushi. Amazing rice to fish proportion! Each piece of nigiri had a very small ball of loosely packed rice. I loved it!  Their special rolls were alright. I don't remember being super impressed on any of them. The appetizers were decent as well. They ran out of oyster so we couldn't try any :(   I'm definitely coming here again. Huge fan of their nigiri! The only reason why I didn't give the full 5 stars is because we had a pretty large group of people... 2 tables... And each time they brought out a big order, they'd put it all on one plate. Most places would separate the servings into two plates so that it's easier to share amongst ourselves. We ended up taking the plates and passing it down all throughout the night. Not a big deal.. Just an inconvenience. Oh, and another thing... They completely missed our entire second round of orders. We just kept sitting there with an empty table waiting and waiting. It didn't seem too bad because I was with my chatting with my group of friends the whole time. Once we realized the food wasn't coming, we just asked them about it. They were able to put in the order quickly.",

Not because I'm a snob but I'm NEVER gonna get my monies worth there. So Bento Box lunch for me. I had the Teriyaki Salmon & that was awesome. it was grilled to perfection. Even had a little teriyaki crispy end goodness to it. The tempura was really good too. Light, crispy outside, juicy inside & had a good sauce for dipping. My PIC got a  Bento Box too of  spicy chicken &  pork mini steak. They were  Meh. Nothing bad about it just Meh. So go in for AYCE or Bento Box lunch (skip the specialty roll - not too special) & you won't be disappointed.",

That's a joke! We've come in here 2 other times and sat at the bar. The chef forgot to put cream cheese inside the roll that we ordered. Both times. Today we just got up and left really irritated.

I really liked the screaming orgasm dish (or something orgasm) on the AYCE menu. The sushi burrito was also delish and light, so you can eat lots of those without getting too full. I like to try the volcano roll everywhere, but I didn't like this one much, only because it had cream cheese. I just took out the cream cheese and that seemed to solve the problem. There are many roll options including those with rice and those without rice. You can get hand rolls or regular rolls.  I like that everything on the menu comes in small portions and/or they offer a lot of items not too heavy on the rice so that we get to try a variety of things without getting full too quickly. To top it off, my friend had green tea ice cream and I had red bean ice cream for dessert. Both were good! I've had red bean elsewhere but not as good as here. My #1 AYCE sushi joint in vegas.",

The first time we did not realize and left wondering why our bill was so big. Yesterday we finally caught on. Really disappointed to see that they did that to us. We left feeling a bit betrayed. But regardless, we love the food here. We'll just have to be extra cautious next time we come back!  It saddens me to leave such a negative review after all the times we've been here, but I just don't want the same thing happening to other customers. The service is decent. The first couple times we were here, our orders took a really long time to get to us, but the most recent times we've been the service has been great! The waitress actually recognizes that we're there almost every week! That's why I feel so betrayed because being regulars, I didn't think she could charge us like that, TWICE, and not expect us to catch on... Especially ME because I, myself, am a server.",

    "text": "Our first night in Vegas left us wanting to wander off of the strip to get our grub on.  We were craving sushi and saw so many mixed reviews around the area, but decided to take a chance on Jjanga and I am glad we did!  THE MOOD: Jjanga is located a little further down from Chinatown in a small plaza.  It seems like the only happening place in this plaza is Jjanga - all the other stores are in dire need of customers.  Imagine the $$ they could be making if they were located right in Chinatown!  The decor inside looks modern/Asian.  There is a bar where you can sit with the enthusiastic sushi chefs.  Patrons who come and sit at the bar are warmly greeted by the chefs.  If you opt for sitting in the dining area, you will have plenty of space between your table and the one next to you.  THE FOOD: Andrew D. and I decided to go for the dinner AYCE for the $25.95 per person.  I especially loved the appetizer dishes since each one that was brought out was unique and each was packed with flavor!  What we ordered: - Garlic Tuna (Delicious and packed with strong garlic flavor! I loved!) - Salmon Egg  - Sea Urchin (This was melt in your mouth goodness) - Sweet Shrimp (Big pieces of tasty succulent shrimp) - Seaweed salad (I'm a lover of seaweed salad and this was so delicious I had to order 2) - Baby Octopus (They come in 3 and are crispy, tasty!) - Golden scallop (These also came in 3.  These are marked off on the menu in red to show that you are only allowed 1 order of these per person - and for good reason! They were delicious!) - Mini Beef Steak (These came in 4 pieces - the beef was super tender and dripping with lovely juices) - Jjanga Burrito (This is not really a burrito, but rather a handroll - the tempura was a nice crunchy complement to the rice, crab, and shrimp) - Salmon Skin Roll - Washington Roll - Jjanga Special Roll (This was a surprisingly refreshing dish.  I loved the crisp of the chopped tomato with the special chef sauce - they were so fun to eat and this is perfect for the hot weather!) - Spider Roll (The soft shell crab was absolutely delicious - the roll was made to perfection!) - Q Roll (Jjanga have sushi rolls without rice - good for those who are counting those carbs/calories - very refreshing!) - Green Tea Ice Cream (I want to say that this is probably the best green tea ice cream I've tasted! I loved how each bite was delicious, milky, green tea goodness). - Strawberry Ice Cream (You are only allowed to order 1 per customer and it was delicious! Get at least one to try!)  THE 'TUDE: If you thought the list above was a lot of food, you are right!! lol.  Andrew D. and I eat like champs and we love good sushi!  The waiters did not miss a beat in stopping by our table to refill our drinks and pick up our empty plates as we efficiently chomped through each dish.  Our waitress also kept checking in on us to see if we wanted to order more or needed anything else.  OVERALL: Jjanga is doing sushi right, but most importantly, they are doing customer service right!!  I loved my time here and would come back again!",

    "text": "Went here earlier this evening and my overall experience was so-so.  I had the All You Can Eat dinner for about 26 dollars per person not including tax and tip.   I really liked the food. Overall, it was very fresh and a lot of really good flavours and variety. Many different types of rolls including baked, deep fried, vegetarian, basic, no rice, etc. Also a BUNCH of appetizers.   The only complaint I had about the food would be the size of the nigiri. They were about half the size of nigiri you would get elsewhere. Obviously, this wasn't a problem since I got the All You Can Eat but I would have been VERY upset if this was A La Cart.   As far as the environment of the place went, some of the tables can be a little close to other customers. Also, the booths are large compared to the table. Both my partner and I were sitting at the edge of our seats in order to reach the table, and at the edge of our seats neither of us were very comfortable.   Finally, my biggest complaint about this place was the service. We were getting served and checked up on a decent amount at the beginning of our meal, but after the first round of rolls came around the service just started getting slower, and slower, and slooooower. After our second round of sushi came, it was at least 20 minutes after we finished until we were asked if we wanted anymore. After that, it took another 30 minutes until they brought our check around. They didn't even ask us if we wanted more, they just brought the check. I would have given this place five stars had it not been for this terrible service. I hope tonight was just a fluke.   Favourite Roll: Japanese Lasagna Favourite App: Cheese Croquette",

I've tried Island Sushi & Grill and Umiya in the past.  This time, a girl friend and I were curious about the 4.5-star rated Jjanga.  We came in for a super late dinner, around 10:00 pm, on a Friday evening.  The place was probably half full so we didn't need to wait for a table.  The staff happily greeted us with a smile and explained hot the AYCE deal works.  We dove right in and ordered the favorites, which turned out to be the ones that can only be ordered once -- the uni, poke salad, sweet shrimp, golden scallop, and beef tataki -- all of which were delicious!  I remember ordering the unagi more than once too.  What I especially liked was this off-menu item, the pork steak with miso?  I don't remember what it was called but our server suggested it in place of one the items I pointed out on the menu.  It was divine...like melt in your mouth, gimme-my-rice, sort of divine.    What I also liked about Jjanga is the candidness of our server.  I forget her name now, but I truly appreciated her honest opinions on the various menu items.  I was going to order the fried rice and she basically vetoed it because it wasn't worth the tummy space.  She also steered us away from the special rolls because she wanted to get the most of our money by indulging in the nigiri and classic rolls.  Some say she's a buttinski, but truthfully, I appreciated her two cents!  I would totally return to this spot for AYCE sushi!",

Other favorites include fresh oysters, yuzu yellowtail, dynamite, & fat sweet shrimp. I pigged out mostly on nigiri and the appetizers. I was full so I didn't get to the sashimi and poke section. I rarely do rolls so I can't comment on that.  Service was very attentive. I think we ordered too much in the beginning because the waiter stopped us and said why don't you start with that? Haha. It wasn't even that much! We had another guy helping us toward the end who was a lot friendlier.  Our food kept on coming and our waters were constantly refilled. I was constantly eating. No breaks! The minor thing that was missing from my usual AYCE sushi favorites - I didn't see white tuna on their menu. Maybe they had it but I didn't ask for it. I was full at that point so it wasn't a priority. The monkey burrito was not memorable. I didn't care for their beef tataki. Their dessert is not much of a selection but I'm not one to come to an AYCE sushi joint for dessert so no big deal. Just mochi and ice cream.  I'll be back to try poke and their sashimi!",

    "text": "Yeah, I'm not so sure about this place anymore.  I wanted to eat elsewhere tonight but, long story short, it's a place with long wait times and they gave away the table when my out-of-town friends were late to arrive. I chose JJANGA as the backup AYCE sushi restaurant because I'd enjoyed it in the past and because it was just a couple of miles from plan A.  Most of the food wasn't too bad. I had a lot of the same things as in my first review, so I'll make comparisons as I can.  Screaming orgasm and golden scallop were still pretty good, and I can hardly ever complain about any baked green mussels. Hotate ebi skewer was alright, but I did feel that the lone bay scallop (a tiny cylindrical piece) didn't represent the \"hotate\" very well. Pike mackerel was annoying because I kept having to dig out pieces of bone, and I thought the accompanying sauce was too vinegar-y.  My nigiri favorites from last time all held up: beef tataki (the best of the bunch), super white, salmon, yuzu yellowtail, and unagi. I do feel that I would have enjoyed the salmon and super white more at other places though.  The monkey burrito was still tasty. Screaming honey seemed to have less of the sauce than last time, and the presentation inside a bowl instead of on a plate struck me as odd.  Now for the escalating series of bad news. First, I learned from the server that the hotate nigiri would definitely also have been bay scallop, which is unfortunate when I can get fresh scallop at my favorite place just a couple of miles down Decatur. Another mystery that was taken away was the amaebi, which I found out was too mushy. The worst part, however, was the uni. After I ordered it, I saw that another person had received uni that appeared too dark-orange, even brownish. I tried to wave a server down to cancel my order, but by the time I managed to do so, somebody had already brought my uni out. This order appeared pale and even gray. Obviously, I refused to eat it.  I might still consider this location as a plan B, but only for desperate situations such as tonight. However, it's no longer a top tier AYCE sushi restaurant in my book. I can see why Michael K. would have lost interest in AYCE if he been eating here. If you're reading this, buddy, there's still other great places in Vegas!",

As stated by another yelper Philip T., \"Calling this Japanese is very misleading\". This restaurant is not your typical traditional Japanese restaurant. A lot of fusion style/unique, rather unnecessary touch added to sushi.   SERVICE Nothing bad to say about the service here. Fast and friendly service. All the food came out quickly and place was clean.  FOOD I love sushi, but not a fan of fusion/innovative rolls. I don't know if it is because I am still traumatized from my first fusion roll experience where I ate a sushi with cream cheese and mango (it just doesn't go together...just no). I stepped out of my comfort zone and tried one of their deep-fried sushi called Touch Down. $8 for 5-7 small pieces and it was nothing special.  I also tried their Alaska roll. Very simple roll with just avocado and thick slice of salmon inside. Decent portion for the price and I enjoyed the thick cut of salmon in it. I would order this again if I ever come back.   I also tried Unagi bowl which was another mediocre dish. Thinly-sliced Unagi on rice. Nothing special.  CONCLUSION This place seemed overpriced for their mediocre food. Everything I tried wasn't anything spectacular.",

Some of the dishes I highly recommend are: baked mussel, poki salad, boom boom, and coconut flake ice cream (chocolate flavor). I don't like coconut, but the coconut taste was subtle and the texture was very crisp. Poki salad gave a refreshing taste after eating several rolls with cream cheese and eel sauce.  Other menus that are worth trying/regular are tempura, Screaming O, Bunny & Bonny, and nigiri.   I wouldn't order Touch Down, Mountain, and Green Tea Ice cream & Mochi.   They don't do half rolls, but the price for AYCE was great.",

    "text": "How can a sushi restaurant in Las Vegas operate with no A/C and rely on numerous fans placed throughout the dinning area of the restaurant??? At first, I thought it was me having an pre-menopause hot flash...but turns out I was not!! Or perhaps the a/c crapped out. It did not!! It was too darn hot n stuffy inside due to the lack of the a/c running!! Reading previous Yelp comments, this place is known for operating with fans to \"help\" cool off the place!! Nice try but what an epic fail!! Such a joke and takes away from the ambiance with having noisy fans scattered all over the dinning floor, buzzing and humming away!!   I met my friends and co-workers for a late dinner after work. They were already seated and had dishes being served to them when I arrived. Everyone at our table decided on AYCE sushi. The service was great and the food was good. One does have to eat their sushi quickly because if not, it starts to lose it's freshness due to lack of cool air! The hot dishes were tasty: stuffed mushroom, beef skewers, fried tempura, etc... I would have given this place 4 stars, but the lack of a/c due to extreme cheapness from the restaurant owner is just not acceptable for a great dinning experience!!!",

That being said, I was glad to come to a birthday lunch at Jjanga with some friends.  And yes, I did overeat!  Sushi restaurants seem to try to outdo each other with names for rolls and for fillings as a hook for customers.  Dancing eel, Burning your ass, and Jackpot just to name three--all of which I fully ate or shared with others at the table.  The burning your ass is an example.  It has soft shell crab and spicy tuna but you couldn't taste the seafood because it had to live up to its name.  The tuna was spicy tuna but it was overwhelmed by the spiciness of the roll, the sriracha on top, and then slices of jalapeno on top of that.  But, that's what I wanted and it was good.  It was very hotly spiced rice.  The Jackpot roll and Mel's roll were good.  The crispy things they put on the rolls are interesting and add texture.  It was the first time I'd had them.  For the finale, I had both red bean and green tea ice cream.  It was a nice way to end this food orgy.  Service was first rate!  With a group of 14 people calling out orders to the server things sounded hectic.  She kept right up with us and things were served in a timely manner.  This is a fine place for a group dinner with privacy like this.  It was such good fun to enjoy ourselves in our own room.",

What really caught us off guard was the sushi chefs and how welcoming and adaptable they were to each patron. Now we are people who like to have fun and make people laugh and it was very warming to see the chefs react to us so well and not be stiff. The servers are always attentive and quick. Super sweet staff and they seem to coordinate well! Now the food is one of the reasons why we refuse to go to any other place. My fiance loves all their rolls that have to do with cream cheese, especially their Baked Lobster Roll and their Popcorn Lobster Roll. I'm a sucker for their Cowboy Roll, which I usually start off with because the flavor is so intense so its a good starter roll rather than finisher. Then I usually follow with a Tuna Naruto because I love the mild sweetness of the crab paired with the cool cucumber wrapping, super refreshing! My favorite meal finisher would be the green tea mochi, I can't get enough of that little ball of cold deliciousness. My favorite appetizer would have to be the Udon Noodles and Miso Soup, always hot and fresh. The Udon Noodles have such a tantalizing flavor that always leaves me wanting more, they are so awesome. The Miso Soup feels like its preparing my stomach for the awesome rolls to come, it really puts me into a good mood haha. The pricing is fair and we are always willing to drop a pretty penny on this place! We love you, JJanga!",

My friends and I came to Jjanga to celebrate the birthday twins and it was probably the BEST all you can eat sushi experience I've ever had....  1)  Without going into specifics, I will tell you that Jjanga's service is EXTRAORDINARY.  Warm, hospitable, fast, and adaptive - they'll make you feel like royalty.  These servers move so fast that if you order sake, sake will appear almost instantly.  At one point, we lost who our main server was because there were so many people handing us food and clearing plates all at once!  2)  The rolls...were delicately crafted and really creative!  I was really impressed with the variety.  If you see some of my other AYCE reviews, you'll note the various strategies that AYCE restaurants use to devalue your experience (too much rice, too much sauce, too many rolls per order, etc).  Not the case here.  Everything was delicious and contributed to a great eating experience.  3)  Uni.  All the uni you could ever want!  So yum!  4)  My list of favorites: - Who's your daddy - Baby octopus - Chicken wing - Grand canyon roll - Big easy roll (garlic + ponzu sauce mmMm)  5)  AYCE menu includes soup, salad, sides/apps, and even dessert!  For those craving a lighter fare, this menu offers a variety.  Don't bother rubbing your belly too long, be sure to check out the karaoke rooms!  An hour of karaoke was a great transition from dinner to dancing later.  Food + libations + friends = good times at Jjanga.  Will definitely be back!",

You'd have to be a local to know about it; but it's well worth seeking out!   All you can eat sushi for $30 made me a bit nervous. There's nothing worse than bad sushi. But this was some of the freshest fish I've ever seen! The miso soup was yummy; but my son's yakisoba arrived with severely undercooked chicken. When it was brought to managements attention, they immediately apologized and took it off the bill.   Overall, they lose one star for raw poultry, but still rate highly for great sushi at an amazing price.",

I wanted to see what was different compared to a lot of other sushi places that I have been to. They have an AYCE menu and a non-AYCE menu which isn't a surprise. I'm unsure what the difference was compared to a lot of other sushi AYCE places in Vegas was. I believe all cuts are different since no chef is the same, but a lot of their menu items can still  be found in another sushi AYCE place in Vegas. This place is still definitely really good, and I would definitely come back here! I love sushi all together, my favorite roles are spicy ones, and JJANGA has a fair amount of spicy roles.

Things to try off their menu: garlic tuna Yozu Yellowtails (refreshing, lemon-y yellowtail) XXX Taste like your ex GF Monkey Burrito Jjanga burrito Pink lady tuna naruto (sauce on the side, if you like it less messy)  I have been following Jjanga since his days at Sumo on Warms springs! I'm glad him and his crew went on their own, so they fully explore what they can do with sushi.  Honestly you cannot go wrong with anything, depending on your taste. Also had the Bulgogi on the menu, sometimes it can be very onion-rich, but it's still good.  If you are in Vegas for a visit and want good off-strip food, this place should be on your must list!",

    "text": "There's bound to be at least one thing on the menu that you make YOUR FAVORITE each time you come to a restaurant and the one thing I absolutely fell in love with is the JJANGA BURRITO.  The one thing that will always bring me back here for.  Over six months ago a friend and I tried this new sushi place called JJANGA Japanese Restaurant.  Everything we tried was good but I honestly couldn't remember what we ordered.  All I know is that we ordered so much food that we couldn't finish.  Just a few days ago, we returned with a few other people.  I never thought that I'd ever return here because I have this thing with places not doing half order sushi rolls.  I like doing half orders so that I can taste a variety of rolls.  This place served chicken wings and so a member of our group who loves chicken wings, well, we ended up here again.    My friend ordered the Jjanga Burrito for the first time and she told me that I should try it because it was really good.  So I decided to give it a try.  The moment I took a bite I said, \"Oh my god this is good.\"  Then after every few bites I'm saying how amazing and how amazing balls it was and how I was going to order another one.  So inside of this roll, there is shrimp, broccoli tempura, crab, masago, green onion, furikake, and layu all wrapped in soy paper.  I think layu is some kind of chili oil.    It's so hard to describe the taste, and all I can say that it's AMAZING.  The rice inside of it is almost like fried rice, but not fried rice (may not make sense but you just have to try it).  The broccoli tempura gives it a crunch with every bite and the flavor with everything else mixed with it is just BOMB!  By far my favorite on the menu.",

    "text": "4.5 stars!  Came here for a lunch buffet at the recommendation of some local family. Probably the best meal we had during our Vegas trip!  Lunch AYCE is $21 (I think dinner is $26). Some of the more expensive items aren't included in the lunch meal, but that was fine. Kids are half priced and you can opt for the AYCE option for them, or order the kids meal separately.  I love how they give you small portions of everything, so you don't get full from eating just one or two things, but can try everything. They don't give you big balls of rice with your nigiri or in the rolls either. The fish was super fresh, and even their hot food items were good (garlic chicken wings!). They even have a small bowl of udon and a bunch of other appetizer dishes... all are small portions so you can try a lot of them.  Service was alright. They came to take our order, but you can tell they slowed down by the time the 3rd or 4th round came along. We love to eat!  The only thing to watch out for is they charge a 20% tip for large parties. I've heard of 15% or 18%, but 20% seemed a bit high, especially since the service wasn't all that great. It's the only thing keeping my review at 4-4.5 instead of 5.  Oh yeah, AYCE includes dessert!!! Green tea and red bean ice cream is so good!  I wouldn't hesitate to come back next time I'm in Vegas!",

From there we waited for our drinks for 5 minutes and we have been waiting for someone to take our order for about half an hour. After waiting we witnessed tables who sat AFTER us getting their food. So we decided to not dine in anymore. It was hard enough to wait in general but we had to wait for the server to come to let him know we weren't dining in anymore. He came to our table and asked, \"did you guys order already?\" And I said, \"no\" and that we were actually not going to dine in anymore and he asked, \"why are you leaving?\" And I explained that we have been waiting for half an hour just to take our order and even flagging him down he didn't come to us. So we felt like we could be at another restaurant where they'll be able to serve us effectively. Then another customer comes up to him while we were leaving saying that her table has been waiting for their check for over 1 hour and he just said, \"okay.\" Then walked away quickly. My party and I left, the customer service wasn't great and attentive as it used to be. I don't recommend Jjanga to anyone anymore. Seems like their staff isn't amazing as it was before.",

    "text": "An AYCE sushi restaurant for those who don't like sushi.  Jjanga is about sushi drowned (literally sitting in a puddle)  with sauces that mask  the taste of the seafood.  Typical AYCE quality; previously frozen, gassed and thawed fish and color added fish eggs atop mediocre quality, sticky, seasoned, over compacted short grain rice.    The nigiri rundown:  Maguro, hamachi, and salmon previously frozen, tako rubbery (not tenderized prior to cooking), the amaebi previously frozen, sticky, ammoniated taste, beef tataki tough, tamago over cooked.  Appetizers are in line with other AYCE joints.  Bought in gyoza and shumai, mayo coated baked mussels, overcooked but flavorful scallop and shrimp skewers, OK teriyaki chicken drowned in cold sauce, chewy steak, overcooked but well seasoned grilled mackerel, and the ubiquitous elongated shrimp tempura (shrimp split lengthwise, heavily coated and fried crisp).  Vegas style rolls are a disaster.  The \"dragon roll\" (Cali roll with a liquid mayo filling topped by rubbery eel and drowned in a cloyingly sweet, sticky, soy concoction) and the \"Jack Pot Special\" (Oily shrimp tempura, crab and cucumber surrounded by oil soaked rice topped with spicy crab, shrimp avocado, tempura cast offs and eel with a watered down spicy mayo spooned over all are enough to stop you from trying more.  Fun ambiance.  Fast service at the sushi bar.  $20.95 lunch, $25.95 dinner.  There is a time limit for ordering.  It was not enforced on two visits.  Falling below the pack of AYCE options in Vegas but an option if quantity is all that matters.",

Within 3 minutes we were already receiving our orders. Some of the things we ordered were;  Salmon nigiri - so amazing, melted in my mouth.  Garlic tuna nigiri - well seasoned and juicy.  Monkey burrito - *Drool* so orgasmic. Fresh Oysters - already comes with hot sauce & the goods, I'm so glad they have it. Unagi - I'm usually not fond of unagi but the eel sauce is da bomb Sweet shrimp - soo fresh and so yummy! Crab balls - perfectly fried goodness topped off with delicious sauce  Poki salad - I love when it's not actual salad. Just seaweed & tuna drenched in sauce. Other places the poki salad is served in a big bowl with a lot of salad and hardly any fish. They hook it up here!   So, to sum it all up, I had a very satisfying experience. I've never had our food served so fast and we ordered so much. Their customer service is outstanding and the fish is one of the freshest out of all AYCE sushi joints. It's also cheap! $25 AYCE and lunch is $21. If you come in from 11pm-2am the price is $21!",

I usually don't prefer AYCE sushi especially when I'm on vacation and want to splurge, but JJANGA was surprisingly good. The service was exceptional and probably bumped it from a 4 star to a 5 star. When we got there we were greeted right away and got a seat at the bar. My friends and I eat A LOT when it comes to AYCE, so much so that the sushi chef couldn't keep up with our orders, but that was reasonable. He tried his best and remembered more than I could have given that he was talking to us and making small talk all the way through. Fairly entertaining guy.. The food was great especially for an AYCE it was really good. I liked that the chef and the server both kept recommending dishes to us. Its not like we paid and they left us alone until we were full, rather, they told us what they liked and what we might like. I appreciate that, in that it shows they aren't really just trying to push customers through like a lot of AYCE places, but were there to provide excellent service. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "We decided to give this place a try and was stoked that I did. We were served by Ricky and he was great! Very friendly, knew the menu and was very fluent in the preparation of the sushi that we ordered. We had the AYCE,   and was very happy with all of our selections!  The rolls that stood out to me was the spider roll, Japanese lasagna,  the garlic ahi, and the tamago! they were so tasty that we ordered three orders of the nigiri and two orders of the rest. This is a very social resturant in  the sence that they have their sushi chefs  all in one area and they are really friendly and engage with the customers that sit at the bar. Ricky  recommended us to try out the grapefruit sake and wow, was that amazing! It was literally like drinking squirt! we also had the monkey burrito (amazingly ridiculous! !) its a sushi burrito, cucumber,  spicy tuna, served with two different sauces. I mean how can you go wrong with that?!?!?! The sushi was executed well and fish tasted fresh and had a very clean taste to it! the garlic ahi is absolutely a must try, the garlic sauce compliments the fish very nicely and adds that kick it needs, the fish was soft and tender, rice prepared well and with the tamago which was just amazing!! This sushi house is great and I will recommend them for all to try, its great to find a sushi house with such a laid back atmosphere and great high quality food, I will definitely be back for more awesome sushi!! Great job JJANGA!",

Many AYCE places has lots of restrictions like ordering so many plates at a time and service is slow but here you can order ALOT and they serve you real quick.  The only restriction is a  45minutes ordering time but this is plenty long for me.  Great selection of sushi, roll and even some sashimi.  LOVED IT!!!",

From poke two ways, to riceless rolls, and amazing yellowtail the sushi chefs made sure to fill our bellies with fish and not a ton of rice. The grapefruit sake was the perfect cleansing drink between courses. We were here at around 9pm on a Sat. night and it was busy but we had no trouble with excessive noise. this place is now on our short list of\" must return\" on our next Vegas trip! Thank you Jjanga for a truly great evening! You helped make it a great birthday dinner for our daughter!",

Now for the food, the who's your daddy appetizer, spider roll and the Grand Canyon are RIDICULOUS! We order them every time... and occasionally we venture out to try new things, these are great for those who are not your average sushi lover. People that I know that say they don't like sushi find themselves amazed by those three items. You must give Jjanga a shot... it's one of my favorite places.",

One of the owners was always so friendly and very helpful so was the servers I've always had. But the last 3 times I've gone the owner I like is never there when I go and I end up getting below average service. I feel that I always need to get someone's attention whenever we wanted to order or needed our drinks filled. I also feel that the nigiri is now much thinner slices with a whole lot more rice. The Saba is also very dry and our appetizers would sometimes never show up or show up long after the sushi had already been eaten. I kept it at 3 stars jus because I used to love this place. I hope they become more consistent.",

Just the variations and range of selection alone makes it a top choice. Everything was SO tasty except for maybe one tuna roll that was a little more fishy than I prefer. It didn't have a sauce with it so either the tuna wasn't as fresh as it should be or I'm used to rolls being covered with sauce to mask any fishiness. I always try a roll without dipping in soy or wasabi to taste it as it should be. I can say that all except for that one needed nothing additional, flavorful in their own right. However, their wasabi is fresh and legit. A little goes a long way, not like that genetic weak wasabi crap. Ambiance is comfortable and zen-ish. Service is good, fun, and friendly. I will be back many many times as this is now my AYCE spot! Just writing about it makes me so hungry!!",

I have to say, this is one of the better ayce sushi restaurants in Las Vegas, as the fish was very fresh, and the creativity with the rolls was a fun experience.  However, I have one big overall gripe with the restaurant. I'm not sure if it was just the time we came in, or just a bad night, but the service got progressively worse throughout the evening. The service was fine towards the beginning of our meal, but after the second round of plates it would be a good 20 minutes before we saw our waiter again.   Another more minor problem was the proximity to other customers. The tables are spaced very close together, which can lead to an uncomfortable dining experience for some. In fact, the lady next to me practically sneezed on me and made me very uncomfortable throughout the rest of the night, as her child was also climbing around our table. Not necessarily fault of the restaurant, just bad patrons, however I think this is something that can be fixed very easily.",

We waited 40+ minutes for our food order! No apology from the staff, they just pretended like nothing happened.  I definitely think Goyemon and Yama sushi are far better AYCE sushi joints.  The quality at jjanga is pretty horrible, the only think I enjoyed was the baked rolls, where the quality of the fish is mass by sweet and spicy sauces.  If you're into nigiri and good quality fish, this is not the place for you.",

It's yellowtail nigri with this yuzu salsa on top. They have a huge selection of appetizers you can choose from as well for AYCE. The fish portions are decent size while the rice in minimal. You also get a stamp card so every 10th meal here is free. Service here is always on point. The wait staff continuously walks around making sure you have everything you need",

    "text": "Before I get into details about the Sushi, etc., I must first say that the service here is AMAZING! The first time we ever stepped foot into JJANGA, they were seating us at one table, and I asked if they could please sit us at another table. It may not seem like much, but the second time we went, the gentleman remembered us and promptly took us to the same table and said, here's your table again. He then went over the menu with us, which is pretty extensive and suggested some of the items on there that we hadn't tried before.   Moreover, he also then surprised us with a special roll just for us and some free sake on the house. The gesture was awesome, but too bad we don't drink alcohol. As I started to place my order, which by the way, I always order the same thing at any Sushi Restaurant, Salmon (Sake), Yellowtail (Hamachi), Fresh Water Eel (Unagi), Crunch Rolls, Caterpillar Rolls, and Seaweed Salad. The waiter also remembered this from our first visit, and noticing that I am probably a creature of habit when it comes to Sushi, the gentleman also suggested that we try the JJANGA Burrito, which is Shrimp, Broccoli Tempura, Crab, Masago, Green Onion, Furikake, and Layu with Soy Paper. May I say that it was pretty darn delicious and we are now addicted to it. If you haven't tried it yet, well then you should. The fact that he remembered that was pretty impressive! On a side not, I also like the fact that they use a proportionate amount of rice and not like most other places where they put an enormous amount of rice.  FYI: AYCE (All-You-Can-Eat) is $20.95 for Lunch (11:30am-3:00pm) and $25.95 for dinner (3pm-2am).  All-in-all, all of my experiences here have been awesome to say the least. They captured me with their service and this is my go-to spot for Sushi in Vegas. Every time this gentleman, which I don't refer to him by name because I just don't remember it, sees us, he always does something out of the realm of just basic customer service.",

Unlike other sushi joints that set up cheaper, rice-filled cuts of fish for buffets, Jjanga is order straight from the menu. Any nigiri or specialty roll is fair game! All if which is delicious and fresh, coming from a sushi snob.  They're open late and a $10 cab ride from the Palms. Hit them up. Yuhee's a bomb server, she kept bringing us more and more 'chef's specials'. They even took our picture with a Polaroid at the end. Feel like Frank Sinatra here!",

They have a ton of menu options for the AYCE- apps, soups, nigiri & sashimi, classic rolls or specialty rolls.   I ordered 1 sashimi, 2 specialty rolls and an order of garlic edamame and I was stuffed! My favorite was the sashimi which you can only order 1 of per guest but the rolls were great also. The rolls come with 8 pcs each so you do feel full pretty quickly.   TIP: They do charge you if you don't finish your food or leave just the rice, so make sure you choose wisely    Overall I was pleasantly surprised about the quality of the fish and would definitely recommend trying it out!",

My visit was spontaneous because I was in this area to shop some groceries and got hungry.  Location and parking is ok I will not say anything bad about that but rest was one big disappointment.  There was single waitress working but she was really confusing. I know that during lunch time not so many people come to such a places and they try to save money on staff but common she was unprofessionally or not trained properly.  After we selected our items from menu she brought us our order after some time. I ordered spicy lobster roll but it was not spicy as usual it is in restaurants it was damn hot. I explained to her and she said \" that's why you drank so much water, haha I was surprised how much water she drinks\" (me). I was shocked by this comment because I don't drink soda or any sweet drinks and I like to drink a lot of water any usual time. I realized that she is unprofessional and just ordered another maki salmon roll.  We asked for check and payed with cash exact amount and she took it immediately in front of us. I never ever saw in my life that waitresses or bartenders take bill before customers leave.",

Super friendly staff that can't do enough for you, even making sure you don't want just one more order of nigiri and don't forget your dessert!  Yes, the nigiri and sashimi portions are smaller, but the quality of fish was excellent, we had various kinds including salmon (including roe, hamachi, octopus. Hand rolls are generous, and they don't mind some customization. There's a nice selection of specialty rolls, and they are all normal sized.   I'd skip the shumai, it was fried for some reason. , and the soft shell crab roll was mostly surimi mix. Chocolate mochi for dessert was a nice finish.

While we were having our appetizer, our first sushi rolls were being prepared so the longest period of time we were waiting on food was like 10minutes.

The selection is huge, if you dont like rice or cant eat it for some reason, they have no rice rolls and they are delicious.

I ordered a roll and because my brother wanted another one she said and I QUOTE \" well she already ordered one so\" UNQUOTE. we just shrugged it off the place is empty we we're the only table but the service was still slow my water wasn't re filled till we almost left. Reading the menu we see that YOU NEED TO PAY HALF PRICE FOR A CHILD 5YRS AND UNDER ???? THATS $11 for a 2yr who doesn't eat more than one shrimp tempura that's insane!!!!! The sushi has some taste it's ok but not very good I wouldn't come back ever again not just because of the bad customer service but because the food didn't have much taste. It's a disappointment because it's right down the street from my house and we are sushi fanatics.",

    "text": "I had JJANGA bookmarked for a while due to its high Yelp rating. I went with three of my foodie friends who were all excited to try a new AYCE sushi restaurant.   JJANGA is pretty small yet very inviting in decor. When you walk in, the sushi bar is to the left and long wooden booths and tables for seating straight ahead. It's dimly lit with colored light up lanterns hanging from the ceiling which totally sets the mood for a sushi restaurant. They also have huge blown up posters of their sushi chefs on the walls which I thought was kind of hilarious and enjoyed!  We of course did AYCE and for drinks had some Mango Soju (which was absolutely delicious, tastes like juice but the alcohol creeps up on you) and cold sake. The house sake is cheap here, $3 for a small and $6 for a large!   For AYCE entrees, we tried a little bit of everything. Salmon, hamachi, garlic tuna, tuna, and super white tuna to name a few nigiri. We also got seaweed salad, poke salad, hotate ebi skewer (grilled shrimp), dynamite, Shu Mai, grilled mackerel (comes out whole), baby squid, fresh oysters, and a few of the rolls.   Pros:  - Nigiri comes in small portions but the raw fish tastes fresh and delicious. The super white tuna is incredible! - Very tasty rolls. At one point we asked one of the servers to surprise us with her favorite roll and it was to die for. Shrimp tempura wrapped in tuna, topped with crab salad and drizzled in a creamy sauce. No rice and no seaweed! SO good! - Grilled mackerel was bomb. Came with a tangy ponzu sauce. Had to be careful picking around the bones since they bring you out the entire fish - Seaweed salad was great but the portion is tiny. My advice would be to order two  - Shu Mai was very good! Not a dish you would usually see on an AYCE sushi menu but all of us thoroughly enjoyed it  - My friends tried the uni (sea urchin) and really liked it. Said it was less saltier than other sushi restaurants and had a nice flavor to it. I thought it looked disturbing. Still haven't built up the courage to personally try uni...  Cons:  - Oysters tasted a little too much like the sea. It had a light ponzu sauce on it but the fishiness was overpowering  - The dynamite was really odd. Didn't look nor taste like your typical dynamite. When I order dynamite I expect like a baked concoction of seafood smothered in a creamy light orange sauce. There wasn't much creaminess about this dynamite. It was brown in color and had an abundance of sliced mushrooms (?) - Whatever the poke salad was marinated in tasted sour   I would definitely say the pros outweighed the cons and the service was pleasant. I enjoyed my experience here and will be coming back for some AYCE!",

I been passed by this place so many time on the way to go to different sushi places. But Im so glad that I gave this place a try. This place is definitely hidden gem.  If you like AYCE, you will love this place. Especially, try 90%, the baked scallops dipping with special sauce will give you extreme happiness. Also as dessert, try the baked coconut flake ice cream... it is so delicious!",

I'm very picky when it comes to quality and the amount of rice in each one. The garlic tuna and super white is a must have when it comes to nigiri here. It completely melts in your mouth.   You know how some sushi places put a crap load of rice in their rolls? Well, the rolls here are just right. Perfect amount of rice in each roll and the quality of the fish is simply amazing. I usually order the something wrong #69 and let me tell you, it's completely out of this world. For all you Japanese lasagna fans, you must go here. Cream cheese inside and out. Enough said.

I'm not a pro but I like to try new sushi places with my friends in Las Vegas and this is the first time I've been so disappointed. It's been an hour since I've eaten and I already don't feel good. It's definitely a risk to eat sushi but after seeing how good their photos on Instagram looked, I decided to give it a go. I never post on Yelp unless it's absolutely necessary and this is the time.

The ambiance is awesome with oversized booths for large groups which I loved & it felt like you were in a village somewhere in Japan (loved it). The music was great with hip hop all night & we had a great group ordering a ton of food.   The food unfortunately didn't match the ambiance. The slices of fish were like paper. The super white was chewy and resembled octopus (major disappointment). The rice to fish ratio was very high with rice winning and they ran out of green tea ice cream. Really?   The service was good however they kept bringing us other people's food. They would just quickly sit the plates down without saying what we were getting & eventually we noticed that none of us had ordered what kept coming over. This was pretty annoying as we must have received 4-5 wrong items.   Some of the ok stuff was the garlic tuna (great flavor but paper thin fish), the big easy roll (great flavor but loaded with rice) and the screaming orgasm.   Overall the food was ok with some small highs & too many lows. With so many sushi choices in town this place doesn't make the cut for me. The ambiance was awesome so it's unfortunate.",

Soo RUSHED, literally not even 5 mins to sit and look over the menu and she came back more than twice to ask if we were ready to order lol. Ok, girly.. Calm down LOL.   No big deal because we were trying to enjoy our visit.. Hopefully it'll be a next time so we can update on our review..",

Highlights were the shumai, escolar, spicy pork and jjanga burrito.  Lowlight was the Cowboy roll.  Never heard of seared beef on a sushi roll before... now I know why I haven't heard of it before.    Servers were very nice, but service was a bit slow and unorganized.

The reason I say that is because they have a variety of rolls such as the no rice rolls, baked, shrimp tempura, and deep fried rolls. I've always went to this place with my girlfriend and we never get tired of it. We always order a lot of salmon nigiri in our visits and the fish to rice ration is perfect. Their AYCE (all you can eat) menu has no restricted items. You can eat everything on the menu if you wish to like to. Their service is always on point, they're quick with delivering your order, you don't always have to ask for a refill on your drink because they always make sure you have a full beverage. They offer AYCE for lunch between 11:30 AM to 3PM for $20.95. Dinner they serve between 3PM to 2AM for $25.95. I have yet tried their A La Carte menu because we've always been getting AYCE, but I'm positive that their entrees do not disappoint. I highly recommend this place for all you sushi lovers!

It's just off the strip which makes their prices incredible!! 25$ all you can eat, rolls for under 5$ and absolutely phenomenal specialty rolls for 8$. I have yet to taste sushi so fresh it melts in your mouth!! MUST try their spring mountain roll, fresh men, and I love my ass roll!!!!!! The first two are riceless but don't let that scare you it has so much flavor!!! The service is over the top especially JJ! We have an amazing time EVERYTIME! Ill never go anywhere else. Definitely a HIDDEN GEM",

Their creatively named rolls, burritos and such have such explosive flavors and present well when brought to the table.

After selecting all you can eat, we were stumped by choice and items titled \"Slap your momma\" and \"slap your mother in law\".   No matter. Jjanga asked us if we had any allergies (NO!) and liked spicy food (YES!)  and swept us right up into sashimi heaven.   Between bites and murmurs of pleasure, we watched dish after dish appear... and disappear. Most were works of art and ultimately the subject of a snapchat portfolio of images. All looked too good to eat. ALMOST...  So... here's where I pull the \"my-partner's-Asian, we're foodies-from-NY, have-lived-in-Cali, eaten-our-way across-Asia-yadda-yadda\" card and say how much we were BOTH IMPRESSED  by the flavors, and freshness of the plates JJ served that night.   So hyped that we tried to get him to open a spot in DC. Lucky for y'all in Las Vegas he declined.   JJ: if your reading this, the offer still stands! Reverse manifest destiny and find your fortune!!!  Fellow gourmands and friends in the feast: get your butts off the strip and head to Jjang for Unforgettable, melt in your mouth sushi and an experience that whet's all five senses!  GOOD EATS (and more) at JJANGA!",

Now that they have moved Sumo 2 has gone completely downhill and so we went to try their new place. A: they remembered our faces as soon as we walked through the door and B: their rolls were out of this world. I thought they were good in the last place but it is nothing compared to what they make now. We will stay loyal to these chefs because they have always taken care of us and make our experiences special! I recommend the fresh men roll and the sexy time roll. We all shared and everything I tried was amazing but these 2 were my favorite because they were new on their menu. I will be taking all of my friends and family there for my birthday since they have tables to accommodate parties. I love those guys and their amazing food!",

I am vegan, so I cannot comment on the fish, but the vegetable sushi was perfect and the edamame and rice were great.  They do offer a children's bento box that was well received by my six year old, she would have given it five stars.  I will definitely stop in next time I am in town.",

A friend of ours is actually a vegetarian so it was nice to see that there were options for vegetarians. Great food and great service.

The waiters come around frequently, but it's not intrusive. They're pretty attentive to your needs.   The thing I like the best is definitely the staff.

Staff was very personable and the food quality was fresh and tasted excellent. Easy to locate and parking was not a problem since it is well off the strip. Good for non-sushi eaters too, choices other than sushi on the menu. Didn't try the All You Can Eat menu (available for lunch & dinner under $30) but had a few sushi rolls, miso soup, gyoza and the hibachi. Orders came fairly fast as compared to the average sushi place, even though they looked busy. Menu had plenty of choices and laid out in plain language what is contained in each roll. Will try their AYCE when we go back in a few months, since most of their rolls were $8.00, AYCE would be a better deal.",

The one thing I can say with total confidence - You will not find another sushi bar in Vegas with better service than Jjanga.    Every server that passes by your table asks if you need anything.  Between each server passing by...there is a busboy who stops by to clear empty dishes or refills drinks.  I was so amazed that I actually counted how many servers stopped by our table within a minutes timespan and I lost track.    The food is good. I found the sushi to be warmer than I would prefer. I don't think they cool down the rice enough.  Their spicy tuna mix was pasty.  I don't think it's freshly chopped per order.  Nigiri fish to rice ratio was really good.  Big pieces of fresh fish.

Hickey is no longer there, or taking a break, it was hush hush when we asked about him and if he was coming back or not. Open bar space but only two chefs working the night we were there so they could not accommodate us at the bar and we got a table. Big mistake. The table next to us put there order in when we sat down, 4 people....we got our drinks, put our order in. The parade of sushi dishes start coming out for them. We still wait.....they put in like 4 more orders, and again the parade of sushi comes to them, we're still waiting. Different servers come by to see if we need assistance and we tell them a couple times we're waiting on our order. Finally we everything at once. The quality has gone done. No passion it seems. My roll looks like it was put together by a child.  When I attempted to pick it up, the tuna on top fell off, the rice fell apart inside and outside the roll, it was a disaster. Wasn't even appetizing anymore. They've deleted some rolls from the menu as well, which I get if they're not bringing in profits.  We always get a couple orders of super white and it normally came out white, this time it was yellow in color.  Not sure if that's a quality issue or the wrong tuna, but meh.  Not to make this totally negative, the manager on duty did notice our wait and gave us 20% off, but I'm not sure we'll return. It's a drive from where we live, but we liked the \"going out\" factor so for convenience purposes we'll find something closer.",

    "text": "This place used to be amazing but ever since they opened the second location it has gone completely downhill. Having been a chef at a sushi bar I can guarantee you NONE of the fish was fresh. In fact not a single piece of food I ate was fresh. Everything from the crab mix to the baked mussels reeked of fishiness. Even the Mochi ice cream was so old, the soft outer shell had become hard and disintegrated into a rough powder in my mouth. They recently fired most of the chefs/staff and you can definitely tell. The service was slow but it's really not the servers fault because the new chefs don't have proper training or ingredients. I'm honestly not one to write bad reviews but I feel their food is a legitimate safety concern, I myself had stomach pain the entire day after. I would highly recommend not going to Jjanga until they have figured things out once again. I'm definitely rooting for them.",

The fish to rice ratio was a bit poor versus other all you can eat places in Vegas. Over all I would recommend this place if you have a chance to stop by.",

    "text": "Best AYCE sushi we both had EVER!!!   Why?  My boyfriend and I were visiting Las Vegas over the past weekend. We decided to steer away from the pricey and potentially over-hyped restaurants along the strip and try the local restaurants in the city. We looked on Yelp and this new AYCE place was rated 5 stars - was a given that we should give it a try!  We came here just after lunch time so it wasn't too much. The first thing that struck us was the welcoming decor and matching cool restaurant t-shirts of the servers! It's so refreshing to go to an AYCE sushi restaurant with the ambience and feel of a a la carte sushi place.   The menu offered a wide selection of nigiri and rolls. They even had Hamachi yellowtail included in the AYCE pricing (this is very rare in Toronto where we're from).   Service: friendly staff, server was somewhat helpful with the wide selection of menu, orders came quickly, the pace of the orders that arrived at our table was perfect to our eating pace, plates cleared off of table promptly.  Food: the ratio of fish to rice was perfect (not too much rice), sushi tasted very fresh, rolls were very creative with many types of combinations of ingredients and extremely tasty (it's obvious that they had spend a lot of time in finding the right combinations that complement each other).  Favourite nigiri: hamachi Favourite rolls: candy cane, playboy special  Price: very reasonable for the quality of the food  Will definitely try to visit again next time I'm Vegas!",

    "text": "I had a decent experience at Jjanga. I read that is was one of the top AYCE around, so I decided to give it a shot. As a starter, I had a reservation for 6 tonight (heads up, 20% included gratuity of 6+ parties). We were welcomed by the hostess and staff members, which is common in many Japanese restaurants.   It took us a while to decide who was doing AYCE, but we got it settled (1hr time limit on ordering, no time limit on dining. I'll get to this in a moment).   My personal orders: our first round of sushi came out rather quicker than expected, which gave them some pretty good kudos.   Dancing Dragon: dragon roll with some shrimp tempura through out. Roll slightly smaller than I've seen in other establishments. Rice to topping ratio was good. Pretty fresh. 4 out of 5.   Spider Roll: soft shell crab and California roll combo. Again, smaller roll than other places. Personally, could have topped with a little more eel sauce. 3.5 out of 5.   Beef tataki: 2 quick seared beef nigiri for you rare meat enthusiasts. Standard nigiri size, rice was seasoned in a unique way which complimented the beef. And a dish not found in many other places. 1 order limit per person 5 out of 5 (I like my beef rare).   Cowboy roll: crab and cucumber filling with seared beef on top. Again, rice seasoned uniquely which was new and a fan of rare beef. What threw it off for me was the crab meat, but never know until you try. 4 out of 5.   Sunset Special: shrimp tempura and cucumber topped with spicy tuna, salmon, spicy mayonnaise, and eel sauce. Had a bigger kick than expected, especially with the spicy mayonnaise. Freshness of the roll was decent. 4 out of 5  Golden Scallop: deep fried scallops, cut in half, topped with spicy mayonnaise. Fried beautifully. As a whole scallop, is a medium size. 2pieces (1 whole scallop), limit 1 order per person. 3out of 5  Now, as I mentioned earlier, the orders came rather quick and was pretty nice to get an early start. As we made our way to round two, the orders started to come a little slower. At the same time, they brought us rolls we did not order and they had forgotten a few. Towards the end of the 1hr ordering time, servers began to make themselves slightly scarce, other than to clear off plates and refilled water. Now here's what got to me. Granted we did order a few passed the 1hr mark, but there was a steady turn over so we did not over stay ourselves, but it's hard to order when the servers are not around. The manager then came over to our table with the check in hand (more or less telling us time to go) while a few in the party were still waiting on a few rolls. We asked for the desserts (ice cream or mochi ice cream) and were given some sideways glances for staying even longer.   Big points deduction for customer service (not worth the 20%). Kudos on a variety of rolls and unique items. The freshness was great (for our party, pretty picky group) and roll were well seasoned/topped. Go for the food not the service.   3 out of 5 over all",

He also forgot one of my rolls, and someone kept trying to bring me a roll I hadn't ordered. Overall the staff seemed hurried, and there was quite a bit of shouting. It fit right in with the loud dance music and loud conversations. It was 8pm on a Sunday, but they were pretty busy, and we had to wait 20-30 minutes for a table.   Overall, I've had worse, but I've also had better. Okay for a fun group evening, but certainly not a relaxed dinner for two.",

Time between ordering food and  receiving it was over 40 min three separate times. Mind you, this was as the restaurant visibly slowed down in occupancy. Manager apologized then came back 5 min later to make some excuse about an employee leaving. The total dinner service for us was just shy of 3 hours! Terrible, terrible service.

Mostly of the rolls were full of fake crab meat with very little fish. This used to be one of our favorite Japanese AYCE place but now i wouldn't even recommend it.",

    "text": "This is a super duper late review but anywho...  My friends and I came to this location for dinner one night a while back. We usually go to Goyemon for dinner but we decided to try this place cause it was my co-worker's favorite place to eat sushi at. Jjanga seems to be quite popular since there were a lot of people waiting to get seated. We waited for a bit before we got our table.   Four of us opted in for their AYCE (all you can eat) option while my boyfriend decided to go a la carte. When my friends and I go into an AYCE sushi joint, we just go all out and start off with 10 orders of salmon, cajun albacore, yellowtail...and then 5 orders of everything else we like to eat. HOWEVER, the server told us that it would be smarter to reduce our orders so it'll come out faster. HUH? Large orders apparently slow them down. It made absolute zero sense to us seeing as if you're cutting a piece of fish for five orders then it wouldn't take that much longer to be cutting the same piece of fish for ten orders. Well, whatever. We did as the server suggested.   The food took forever to get out to the table.   They also lost half of our orders. Half of our orders never came. Half of the orders that we already reduced to the server's liking.   As for the fish itself ... it was quite lacking. The flavors seem very very mild compared to what I'm used to. I might as well be eating rice.   We also had 2-3 orders of uni (sea urchin) to give it a try and well, it was possibly the worse uni I have ever had the pleasure of eating. It was mighty bitter. I was a little worried. I told our server that it was bitter and she just looked confused. She left saying that she was going to tell the chefs but never took the uni away. I had to get someone else to take it away.   It also took ages for them to bring us the check. They also didn't give us a stamp card (loyalty card - every 10 ayce, you get 1 free I think.) Therefore, at the end of it all, I don't think I'll come back ever again. I don't like the service, I don't like the bitter seafood, and I don't appreciate flavorless fish. Thanks!",

    "text": "Worst service ever! DO NOT GO HERE.   Summary: We waited 4 hours for our food Not all our food came We left AYCE sushi hungry They had the nerve to charge us and even include 18% tip!  I came with a group of 7 and they were busy and understaffed so they sat us in a private room because they didn't have seating in the main room available. This was fine with us except they seemed to forget about us. After 30 minutes some girl came in and asked us for our order without giving us menus. We asked for some things then asked for menus to order additional items. 1 hour since we got there... another girl walks in brings us one menu for the 7 of us and then takes our order again because apparently the first girl who took our order was a busser. So we order again. After another 40 minutes they bring out some food but not all of it. And some of the rolls they brought us we didn't even order. We wait another hour and at this point have been there for 2.5 hours. No more food. One of the guys in our group goes to ask them where our food is and they say they lost the order. So we order again (this is our third time ordering) and we wait... and then after another 30 or so minutes they bring us one or two rolls out of the eight rolls we ordered. So we asked where the other rolls were and we were told they were having a problem in the kitchen but they would come. So we keep waiting and they don't bring out the rolls. At this point we're fed up so we ask to speak with a manager. We've been there 4 hours and just want to leave. The manager offered us 15% off but that wasn't enough so after complaining more they gave us 50% off. None of us even wanted to pay because we were still hungry and you shouldn't leave AYCE sushi hungry. They also never bussed our table and left a bunch of trash, dirty plates and leftover food. It was disgusting.   Overall this place sucks and it's the worst sushi experience I've ever had. Unfortunately their food is good but the terrible experience and awful service means I will never be going back.",

Since the moment we arrived for lunch our orders were subpar, late, and WRONG. 3 orders crab balls only got 2, 2 rolls never came, spicy salmon and crab hand rolls came out completely smushed, and the fresh men roll only had TWO pieces of fish and was missing a lot of ingredients. Plus one piece had nothing in it. The sushi guys looked lost behind the bar like they were pulled of the street that morning and were going through a crash course. Granted there were three other tables so it was super busy (NOT!!), and our waitress was either purposely delaying food or forgetting since we the three of us were doing AYCE but she was definitely more concerned acting like a secret agent with her collar mic. Go to SAKANA! Plus they play psy!",

My husband and I are generous tippers but this time I feel like she didn't deserve it.   They also ran out of a lot of stuff and this is really bad especially that most people come here for the AYCE.

All the food here is great, my favorite is the Bunny & Bonnie, there's this topping of shredded string deep fried carrot. Sounds weird but seriously, it works! And when getting Sake you have got to try the Alladin Junmai. Such a fantastic complement to the food. Definitely one of my favorite places in town to eat, not just among sushi places, but of all restaurants, this place is one of the best! Probably the only downside is the TV's. Weird thing to diss on, but whenever I bring a group of people, obviously we're all stuffing our faces and can't talk too much, so we watch tv. They have 4. Almost always, all 4 are different things. My group of friends have to play musical chairs around me to all be sitting looking in the right direction..... yes my friends can be morons but come on, just make all the TV's the same lol. Even so, I won't stop coming here, I just love the food and the staff here, I think a bunny and bonnie is happening tonight.......that's just what's gunna happen for me tonight =p",

The rolls weren't brought out in a timely manner and were mediocre at best.  I ordered three rolls and the waitress had the nerve of asking me if I was actually gonna eat all of it and reminded me of their no left over policy.  I instantly thought \"WTF\" are you serious?  Of course I didn't make a big deal of it.    I tried this place based off other reviewers suggestion and their special pricing at lunch but after this experience, I'll stick to Yama and Sakara.",

    "text": "3.5 stars  Felt like AYCE sushi and decided to check out a new place. I had Jjanga bookmarked so I decided to check it out. It's located in a small strip mall.  The interior is quite nice, much nicer that the exterior. Service was attentive, and I opted to sit at the sushi bar since I was dining alone. Servers came by regularly to refill my water and ask if I wanted to place any kitchen orders (i.e. appetizers, desserts). Sushi orders I placed directly with the sushi chefs sitting behind the bar.  I ended up eating quite a bit of food, definitely got my money's worth. I am pretty sure that I ordered over $60 worth of food for the AYCE dinner price of $25.99.  The quality of the food was okay for AYCE. The uni was mediocre, and the agedashi tofu not impressive (a bit cold, not that crispy). Some of the nigiri weren't the freshest either. I noticed that a lot of the fish was pre-cut, which makes for faster assembly, but not up to higher standards. The sushi chef also forgot one of my orders, though he apologized profusely when I reminded him and made it immediately.  The menu was large, but the variety just so-so (a lot of the rolls were similar).   Like many other Japanese restaurants across the country, this is a Korean-owned establishment, and the servers and sushi chefs were all speaking Korean to each other. This is not a problem for me, but just don't expect super authentic Japanese fare.  Overall, I had a pleasant meal, though I have had better experiences at other AYCE sushi places in town.  P.S. The menu says there is a 45-minute time limit for placing order for lunch AYCE, and 60-minute time limit for ordering dinner AYCE, but no time limit for overall dining time.",

My family loves coming here for the riceless rolls (fresh men and Chinatown are our favorites) as well as the chicken wings.  Ending the meal with a little scoop of green tea ice cream never hurt anyone!    But in terms of quality of fish and freshness, this is great.  Some rolls are a little heavy on sauce or on the fusion side, but the nigiri negates all of that.  The garlic tuna is by far my favorite, a smoky garlic taste.  The hand rolls are fun and there's a great variety on the menu overall.  There is something for everyone here, you don't have to eat raw fish if you don't want to.  The service is also very quick and friendly!",

The server was very nice and overall, I had a good experience.   I came back today with my sister for all you can eat,  and we ordered 8 plates of sushi. I say if you have not eaten at all, you can finish those 8 plates in -6 minutes. No joke. They're just unique but definitely worth it. Our whole order came out super fast despite all the other demanding customers going wild on this fine New Years Eve.  I'm glad I did give them another chance because their ayce is amazinggg.",

First the staff was left and the food which I thought okay hopefully nothing changes. They revamped the restaurant giving it a make over and I thought... awesome! But eventually the staff I grew to love started leaving too. I use to come to this 3-4 times a month and always brought my friends/family and tourists. I ended up moving back to Texas and got to come visit it after a year and oh my gosh to say I was heartbroken is an understatement. There was only one familiar face left. The whole menu changed. The basic spicy mayo got kicked up 10,000 and over powered all the other flavors. I had to take breaks and chug water due to my palate being destroyed. My very favorite roll was the tuna Naruto and it was completely gone off the menu so I begged the waitress I recognized to see if the chef could recreate it which they did try but it was not the same roll or flavors. I'm so so saddened at all the new changes. I hope the owners know what they are doing with all the revamping they are doing. As this place use to have long waits and delicious sushi.",

Good considering Friday is a busy night for most restaurants. The atmosphere is cool, clean, and modern. The service was fast and friendly.   Now on to the good stuff: the food. Their menu is extensive and a little overwhelming. We filled up in nigiri which in my opinion had the perfect fish to rice ratio unlike most places where you get a tiny slice if fish over a huge portion of rice. The yuzu yellowtail was awesome .. The citrusy brightness of the yuzu paired well with the fresh hamachi. Other tasty nigiri we had was the garlic and Cajun albacore. Another thing I liked about the menu is they have some rice-less rolls which the wifey really appreciated. The Fresh-men roll was good and wrapped in rice paper and we had another rice-less roll wrapped in cucumber. They have great appetizers too. The sashimi salads (there are 4-5 on the menu) are limit one per customer but are so good! Dessert is included in AYCE price and you can get 1 scoop of ice cream and 1 mochi. Wish they had better desserts but the quality of the fish makes up for it.",

What more can you ask for- being served by courteous staff and the sushi Chef's are fun to deal with- they always smile and are attentive to every order and gives us the freshest and mouthwatering sushi and Japanese cuisine.

The staff is always energetic and welcoming.  If you aren't too familiar with the menu, they always have great suggestions.  Bring a group of friends to experience this local jewel and be sure to get your All-You-Can-Eat loyalty punch card.",

    "text": "We were hung over and really hungry so we decided to hit up Jjanga because of the yelp reviews. We weren't expecting much especially considering most ayce sushi places use poor quality fish and pack in the rice so hard that its like you are eating a rock, but Jjanga ended up pleasantly surprising us.  We ended up trying a lot of the nigiri and rolls and there were definitely some ups and downs, but I would mainly say ups. One thing to note when coming here, don't expect something more traditional like what you get at Kabuto, but that's one thing I do like about Jjanga that they have some fun rolls and the iron chef banners of the chefs on the back :)  Garlic Tuna - I liked this one because it had garlic, some spice, and a decent fish on top.  Cajun Albacore - I wasn't a fan of this particular dish, I didn't feel that the flavors went well together.  Salmon - The fish was decent, but definitely not as good as the salmon I get in Seattle.  Three Some - This was by far our favorite, really enjoyed the flavors and how can you go wrong with deep fried cream cheese :p  Gyoza - Its a standard gyoza lol.  Bulgogi - I was surprised I liked the bulgogi here since I am very very picky and typically only like my home made bulgogi.  Chicken Wings - These were tempura fried chicken wings, they were surprisingly good but very hot when you first get them, like burn your mouth and continue burning your face as the oil drips down as you're screaming and trying to get a napkin to wipe it -_-  We got plenty more, but I don't remember the exact names of the other rolls. Another thing I really appreciated was that they put a normal amount of rice for the nigiri, unlike other ayce I have been to where they progressively put more and more rice as you order. For an ayce we felt that the quality was very good and even better then some of the a la carte sushi restaurants we have been to. And to top it off the service was also good. I would definitely come back the next time I am in Vegas.",

We had a few delicious appetizers and all were amazing!  the cream cheese stuffed jalapenos to the poki, all beautifully prepared and amazingly fresh.  We had a few nigiri such as tuna, salmon, beef tataki and ikura and again, all very fresh and very little sauce.  I don't like my rolls or nigiri's covered in sauce, makes me feel like the restaurants are trying to hide something that's not fresh.  We had the amazing house flavored sake which made our night even better paired with all the great food we had.  I would definitely recommend this to all my friends in town and out of town.  Another plus side, the staff were all so friendly and professional.  Can't wait to return!",

Some of the rolls took a little time to come out but they were baked rolls so it's forgivable. I love unagi  nigiri and I felt like the rice to eel ratio was appropriate. The knife cuts weren't perfect but listen this isn't sushi on the strip that's going to cost you $20 bucks a roll either. If you want decent sushi for a decent price then Jjanga is the place to go.",

Their food is always, always, always fresh. I have been back there 3-4 times and not once have I had anything that left a bad taste in my mouth.   The atmosphere of this place is one you can easily fall in love with. Day or night you are always greeted with friendly smiling faces. The staff takes the time to come up and greet you and get you to your seats right away. Once at your table, it is game on for the AYCE sushi menu. Don't be shy in this place, they want you to try all they have to offer.   Once you are here, it is like family... We take our 4 month old in there and she loves it. It is quiet enough that she'll sleep straight through our stay there. A perfectly balanced ambiance. The servers are very friendly and helpful, always making sure you have what you need. The owners are fantastic. They help make your eating experience one to remember. We absolutely LOVE Jjanga sushi.",

The chefs are amazing and have great personalities (take good care of them and they'll get creative for you) and the staff is friendly and attentive.  The grapefruit sake is awesome on its own or in a sake-bomb and the menu is refreshingly different from other places around town.

The atmosphere was energetic and fun and everyone was welcoming right when we walked in.  The sushi was simply amazing.  We did the AYCE and the food just kept coming.  The wait staff were all very attentive to our needs, our plates and glasses were always full.  The yellowtail sashimi was a favorite, along with spicy tuna and salmon, but pretty much everything we tasted was fabulous.  I don't particularity like grapefruit or sake, but the grapefruit sake was like nectar of the Gods!  After sake, and tons of sushi, we had mochi for dessert, along with a glass of red.  Even the wine glasses were fun!  They were painted with fun sayings on them.  Mine had a dog on it and it said \"fetch me my wine\" haha!  Loved it.  JJANGA is a great place if you are looking to have amazing food and fun evening out.  We will be back and hope to check out the karaoke room next time!",

Maybe a bit pricey for your standard meal outside of the AYCE deal, but for $20 lunch or $26 dinner all you can eat, you really can't go wrong. Overall good quality of fish, but not necessarily superb. On one instance had a plate of Uni that was unpalatable. If you are a sushi snob, you might not enjoy the atmosphere of this joint as it can be haphazard, hectic and loud, which I guess is expected for Vegas. All in all, experiences here have been worthwhile and I'd definitely come back for seconds.",

Throughout the night, I'd have to say we got some of the best service I've ever seen at a restaurant, out of any low budget burger joints through high end suit-and-tie places I've been to.  The staff, from the managers to the waitress, were all extremely attentive and eager to make us happy.  We did AYCE, and some places make you wait too long before each order, but our table was constantly being kept full of sushi.  The first order came out in less than 5 minutes.  The sushi itself was excellent, you get full rolls for each order unlike the small half-rolls that some AYCE places give.  The selection is huge and includes appetizers and dessert (included in AYCE).  My only regret is not having a bigger stomach because I got stuffed quick and want to try the whole menu!",

Also, keep track of what you order, chances are.. You will not get it.  Service: Not the best in the world. The staff are so so.

Ice cream mochi is one order per person. But they also have ice cream. I ordered chocolate but I was expecting plain ole chocolate not whatever I got. It was like rocky road mixed with something else.   The service started out well because they weren't busy but by the end of our meal, it was a struggle trying to order some more things / dessert. Guess they were a bit overwhelmed and then started mostly paying attention to the larger tables.   Nothing in particular stood out. They seem like a place to go to when other places have hour long wait times around dinner time (~7-8pm).   Oh yeah, they have karaoke and sushi rooms, too. Interesting.",

As someone who comes from a customer service professional background, Jjanga left a very bad impression on my family and myself after tonight's dine in experience.   Jjanga is extremely unorganized and super slow when it comes down to their service. From missing orders from our appetizers and sushi and providing extra food of any appetizer or sushi we didn't order. They took over 15 minutes to give our octopus nigiri roll. Seriously? We had to constantly keep asking and checking on the order, but the waitresses showed no concern and if we hadn't checked on it so much we probably wouldn't receive our octopus nigiri just like the other items we ordered that was never obtained.  Also the waitresses would just place our orders on the table and run along immediately afterwards. They never once initiated and asked if everything was okay, or if we would want to order more food, but we were the ones always having to try to catch them to place another order. I assumed that since we were in a big party that they would be more attentive but I was wrong. I was trying to order ice cream from this waitress, but she literally looked at me and ignored me. That definitely did not sit right with me once she did that, so I did get a little loud and told her what's up. Other than that the only positive feedback I'm able to provide is that they were quick on the refills on our drinks.  Never coming back here again that's for sure.",

My favorites would have to be the garlic tuna nigiri, the Threesome roll, the uni (of course!), the Cowboy roll, and shit I can't remember what else we ordered but we just kept on going. Their menu has so many items to choose from & everything we ordered was delicious! Except for my miso soup. Kind of watered down but hey no one goes to a sushi place just for miso soup.  The nigiri fish-to-rice ratio was pretty good. There was more fish than rice, hallelujerrrr.  There is also a bar & karaoke but I'm not sure when they hold karaoke nights. Our waiters were super funny & nice. Didn't even charge us for our leftovers :)  A freaking + on this place. This is my new go-to for AYCE.",

After a few items, the cooks changed and so did my experience. I'll say that after the cooks changed, you'll see an uptick in my dining review.   Amaebi: Beautiful but very bitter Uni: Very cold and fishy tasting. Could have probably been frozen before and definitely has been out for a day or two.  Beef Skewer: overcooked and not flavorful Oyster: delicious. I would eat 5 more if I could but they only allow one.  Garlic Tuna: pretty good.  Raw Beef: cut too thick. It felt chewy but not because of the quality.  Yuzu Albacore: Perfect. I'd eat this all day. Allow the Yuzu to cook your albacore for like a minute or two. Then dig in. Acidic, firm outer flesh but very tender with the plump rice. Seriously great.  Salmon Nigiri: fresh and tender. Nothing special but it was a good couple bites.  Mackerel Grilled: the ponzu sauce wasn't good to me and I think if it was just seasoned more with salt, it would be delicious.   Overall, I'd want to eat here again if i was in town. But I'll be pigging out on nigiri the whole time.",

Someone in our party got the regular lunch AYCE which was 21.95 and even with that there was restrictions to dinner items only. I wasnt expecting much for the price but honestly I would rather pay full price at my regular spots and get all half rolls and appetizers I want . Food was OK, I wasnt impressed.

We have literally attempted to eat here THREE times already with no avail & we are f*cking tired of wasting our gas AND our time!   1.) We came at 8:30pm on a Saturday & the hostess warned us that if we ate there, they would be closing in half an hour. I asked if that was a normal since Yelp & their doors say they close at 2:00am, and she said, \"No, just tonight. We are closing early at 9 tonight for a special occasion.\" Being our first time & planning to do all you can eat, we didn't want to be rushed & opted to eat somewhere else. Strike one.   2.) We attempted to come again at 5:00pm on a Sunday. Yelp showed they were open so we headed over... only to find the doors locked & a handwritten schedule on the door with whiteout over Sunday that read, \"CLOSED ON SUNDAYS.\" This had to be new because the same information was on Yelp and on maps. Strike two.   3.) And lastly... we drove over just now at 6:00pm on a Saturday. Checked Yelp and verified they are open until 2:00am... only to find the venue filled with construction and a note on the front door that says they are renovating until October 8th. Seriously? Seriously?!   Three strikes, you're out. We give up now. Bye.",

The boyfriend and I went on a double-date with my sister and brother-in-law for dinner around 5-6PM. We had been greeted and seated right away. LOL. The entire staff enthusiastically acknowledges any patron that walks through the doors.  Liked the setting, and we enjoyed the fact that it wasn't as crowded as our original favorite AYCE establishment.  2-sided menu for AYCE sushi, and separate menu for drinks or specials. We liked everything we ordered, but our favorites were Three Some Special, Mistake, Japanese Lasagna and Sunset Special. Hahaha... I still don't know what to make of the Bacon Roll though - savory, yet sweet. Maybe it's just the idea of having bacon at a sushi place?  We were constantly checked up on here, and I liked the way they made sure the tables were clear for upcoming dishes.",

This is great for friends who can't or don't want to eat as much. Space is big and clean. Bathroom is clean and has mouthwash, toothpicks and floss! The fish is pretty good quality for an all you can eat place. My friends ate lotss of salmon. My favorite roll to get is salmon skin roll. The first hand roll I got was good and crunchy so I ordered another in the cut style, but the salmon skin in the cut roll wasn't crunchy and more soft. But my friend's cut salmon skin roll was crunchy. So it's not consistent.   Service by Kara was great. Friendly & great sense of humor. Got all our complicated orders for our vegetarian friend right. Helpful and checked in on us a lot. Very patient with all our requests.   10% off your bill if you write a review on yelp. Cheaper AYCE price at lunch. Some items cost more if you order a la carte. The menu can be a bit confusing but they answer all your questions if you ask.",

The same plaza contains \"Japanese Cuisine by Omae\" and has a new Thai restaurant opening.  I hope the area becomes the next Seoul Plaza.  Misc: - Staff was mostly Koreans (nothing wrong with that).  I can't think of a AYCE sushi place in Vegas that's Japanese owned/mostly staffed.  Sushi Kaya and Geisha House were Korean oriented.

I've been here twice now and I've had a so so experience. I do like the oysters.  The most recent time I went, they changed their serving size to one because of the season. I'm not sure when oyster season is so I'm not sure if that's accurate information. The salmon nigiri wasn't that great, nor was it terrible. I really like the beef tataki. It was pretty tasty. It's a seared beef over rice. I was surprised that the golden scallop was deep fried. I should have read the reviews. I really enjoyed the baby octopus the first time that I had it, but the second time wasn't that great.   Apparently you can order salmon belly, but that's only if it's available. I did try the spring mountain roll which has no rice. There was a lot of sauce on top. It was a pretty good roll except for the abundance sauce.   Service was really great at first. They were attentive and took our order. Halfway through our meal, they had a few large parties arrive and completely ignored us. It took us a while to get our dessert. :(",

    "text": "Where to start with a sushi place this bad?  Well... it's not absolutely horrid, it's just not good with terrible service.  As I write this first paragraph I am torn between two and one stars.  It's been settled one star.  Let me tell you how I got there.  Food:  The food... is not good.  I didn't get sick, I didn't think the fish tasted terrible, it was all just so very bland and off.  We started off with one of the \"burritos\" which was fish, krab, cucumber, and avocado, wrapped in rice and a rice paper wrap.  This was the best thing we ate.  We actually said to each other, \"If this is what all their food is like, we're totally sold on this place!\"  That is, however, where things started to get worse.    We ordered about 2 dozen orders of nigiri with various fish on top.  Salmon, yellow tail, tuna, squid, and scallops.  My usual thought is that the rice should have sushi rice taste and the fish should be a decent thickness with a good texture and a little chilly.  This place basically gave us plain rice (little to no vinegar taste) with fish that I didn't know you could cut it that thin.  The most confusing part to me was that the fish was warm.  Not room temp, but warm warm.  Like, it's been sitting on top of an oven that was turned on and it didn't cook but got warm.  This made my stomach question its freshness.    I also ordered a couple of cut rolls, rice-less rolls, and a hand roll.  The alaska hand roll to be specific.  Or as I like to call it, salmon slurry shoved into seaweed that looks like a dog just puked up a piece of salmon gristle.  I couldn't finish it to say the least.    Food being mediocre, ok that's a 2-3 star score so why the 1?  Service.  After 45 minutes of being seated.  We had ordered twice and eaten once.  Funny how that is since their menu says, \"Ordering time limit is 45 minutes\".  I mean seriously, 45 minutes to cut fish in a restaurant that is NOT busy on a Friday afternoon.  When i say not busy, I mean there are 3 tables that have people at it and 6 people at the sushi bar.  45 minutes!!! The waitress responsible for our table kept on walking past us and avoided eye contact and to add salt to the wound, in the end, she charged us for dinner prices instead of lunch.    Will i come back?  NO.  Do I think it's worth suggesting to others?  NO.    TL:DR - Avoid at all costs.  How does this place have 4.5 stars?",

    "text": "i was debating whether to stop at Jjanga or Sushi House Goyemon -- i so wished i went to Goyemon instead because I did not have a good experience at Jjanga.   we got there a little after 12:30pm and it was not crowded. We were seating and ordered right away. The menu says you have 45 minutes to eat for AYCE lunch. The service was SUPER slow. I didn't get my 2nd plate until 45 min later. I was thinking, they better not kick us out, I'd be so pissed.  The first round of hamachi looked incredible and tasted great. The 2nd round of hamachi were poor looking and was warm temperature!   The only fish that tasted fresh were hamachi and salmon, the rest of the fish, i can pass.   I just cannot stand sashimi to be warm -- just not sanitary!  and these fish weren't thick cut either.. they're quite thinly sliced.  some of the rolls were okay; spider roll was fine. I wish they would serve us faster so I can try different items.   the waitress wasn't great also, she forgot one of my order and charged us for dinner price instead of lunch. And no matter how i try to make contact with her or wave my hands around, I cannot get her attention at all! I was just annoyed. I was very temped to just walk out the door and not pay because service was that bad.   no, i will not visit Jjanga again. I was glad that I didn't bring friends here, it would have been an embarrassment.",

The server came back telling us that is the eel,  when he said it was chicken.  After she already ate like half of eel (\"chicken teriyaki\") he wouldn't give my friend a new batch.  Telling her to share and just eat your food patronizing her like a child.  Also demanding she still pay after not eating her ate off food.",

    "text": "I came in here on 2 occasions, the first one being with my cousin and the other time with my girlfriend.  The first time with my cousin was kinda \"eh\" in terms of the customer service. I felt that they were kinda trying to get us out of there (even though we stopped ordering food and were just talking because we were catching up). I also found it funny that they would not add jalapeno slices to one of the rolls we had ordered because it was \"too busy, and they only add it if you are buying a la carte\". To be honest, I really don't understand the point of that because regardless of how busy other locations are, they'll do whatever you want to the sushi (at least to the places I have been). Regardless, the sushi was awesome so I decided to come back a second time with my girlfriend.  The second time I came here, we sat at the bar, and it was completely different than the first visit. I felt that the waiters and waitresses were more attentive, and things came out faster. It was just as busy as the original time I went...maybe it was an off night for them the first time around.   Overall, both times, the sushi was great. The fish tasted super fresh, and the quality was on point. I highly recommend the \"freshmen roll\" and the \"monkey burrito\" among other things that I forget the names of. The chefs are all super friendly and will cater to whatever you want, just don't expect that to happen if you're sitting at a table because you'll probably get denied from your server.   I will probably be back... the sushi is great!",

But we started receiving a bunch of rolls that weren't ours. We had ordered around 25 rolls and 14 of those orders were wrong. The customer service was pretty good until they started to talk back to us. The one waiter claimed that we ordered 7 of the same rolls when we didn't even order it in the first place. All in all, it was a pretty bad experience. Also, thanks for the 10% off. :^)",

    "text": "I was intrigued by the enormous number of high reviews in a short time, but was never sure when I would make it here.  Saturday night was double date night with our friends who are getting married at the end of the month.  We both had Hachi coupons for Red Rock and carpooled from Henderson to eat there, only to find it mysteriously closed without notice.  We all wanted sushi (well, Steven S. doesn't eat sushi but will eat cooked stuff) so I angled for Jjanga and Nicole B. begged for Oyshi.  I won since we drove, and off we went :)  Upon arriving at Jjanga, we walked into a really nice, spacious and well-decorated atmosphere.  The guy greeting us was so full of energy!  We had no wait thankfully and were immediately seated at a booth that had an impressive structure to it.  The booths are very spacious and sort of private, which was cool.  The service was truly outstanding throughout the night!  Our primary server was Jane, but everyone on the team including Mr. Energy were checking on us.  The food orders came out so fast that we were never waiting too long, except for the cooked meal.  We started off with iced green tea for me and Steven S.  Eric R. got hot green tea.  Our gripe was that the tea was basically water with a dash of green color.  No flavor - Eric R. asked for a pot was told there is only one for the whole restaurant.  We got refills but these items are not worth the cost in the future.  Steven S. went with the salmon teriyaki and subbed brown rice - this took quite awhile for him to get and initially the rice came out white - instead of leaving his hot plate and bringing him new rice, it was taken away for awhile but did come back steaming hot...except his side dish of \"mashed potatoes\" was a cold pink potato salad which freaked him out.  I tasted it and it was fine, but I do not think Americans like cold mashed potatoes.  The 3 of us did AYCE, and there were many items to try.  My first round included yuzu yellowtail, a salmon skin handroll, scallop sushi, and mackerel.  The salmon skin handroll came out surprisingly fast and it was quite excellent, crisp, non-greasy, with gobo, avocado and cucumber.  The yuzu yellowtail was pretty good.  The mackerel was covered in this ginger dressing that I found odd for pairing, but the scallop was great - nice hunks of scallop mixed with masago and green onion.  Eric R. got the Washington roll (salmon and avocado but with that ginger dressing again, which he did not like and Steven S. did not like on his salad - it was kind of creamy) and a few other pieces (tuna, halibut).  For apps, for grins I got who's your ex wife (jalapeno stuffed with fish) and agedashi tofu (teeny tofu square, tasty but more room temperature).  Eric R. got the ebi hotate skewer which he said was covered in some sort of mustard sauce.  We also tried the bulgogi app which was actually really good - with onions on a hot sizzling plate.  Nicole B. got James Bond, California, and Spider Rolls and seemed happy with them - they were able to make rolls with brown rice too.  Eric R. then got the sashimi salad (he said it was okay) but was happy with the poki salad.  Our next round of nigiri was ikura and beef tataki for Eric R. and tako, ika, and amaebi for me.  The amaebi was really good.  I asked the energetic guy up front for the fried heads which is happily offered to get for me upon request.  I ordered 2 but since they took awhile he brought me 4.  Next Eric R. and I got negihama handrolls, and I had jalapeno slices added and he got surf clam.  My final order was another round of scallop nigiri and uni.  The uni was all excellent except for one piece which was darker and when I bit into it I hit a huge piece of shell.  I showed it to a server and it was no big deal - but she did apologize.  Eric R. got mochi and ice cream and Nicole B. got mochi to finish.  The highlights of the experience are the ambiance, the great service, and the very fast delivery of food.  Nothing was ever forgotten, food came as soon as it was ready, and many servers stopped by to check on us and take more orders.  No one ever seemed rushed or trying to time us.  What I recommend from my experience are the salmon skin handroll, scallop sushi, bulgogi, and the amaebi.",

First off, customer service is a huge deal to me (isn't it to everyone?) I called to make a reservation 3 days before the actual dinner, and the hostess put me down no problem, asked if I have ever been there and if I knew how to get there, I said thank goodness for Mapquest and we were excited to try it out!  I made the group reservation for 9, and we were seated immediately, given menus, and asked for our drink order. Sake bomb time! Beer was served in a fancier cup, and the sake in the typical shot glass.   Time to order! Unfortunately the bill was only allowed to be split four ways, (not sure why that's a rule of theres) Only complaint. but the menu was extensive, there was SO much to choose from! I went strictly Nigiri, Salmon, Tuna and Shrimp....I ended up eating 38 pieces all together and it was delicious, fresh, and quick. The pieces are a little smaller which is a given being its AYCE, the rolls I did get to taste were just as amazing. One of the rules is you cannot share with someone who is doing Ala Carte, but we didn't mind.   We will definitely be back. We were so happy with the food and service.",

My rule of thumb for people who are iffy on sushi is try something fried or has some cream cheese in it.... clearly this is where I went wrong. The tempura on the fried sushi tasted soggy and greasy and the sushi had so much cream cheese in it was just overpowering any fish that was in the roll. Some rolls was soo fishy I couldn't take it. Lastly, for some of the stuff we ordered to be fried, it didn't come out as hot and some tasted old. It was literally taking bites of regret each time I ate a new piece.",

    "text": "I rattled off a long list at my friend for lunch and this caught her attention so off we went with her two little ones in tow.   It's a AYCE place, but if you want to go a la carte, I was surprised at how reasonable the prices are. It's cheaper than the average, but the quality is better than the average too!   We decided on the AYCE though to be able to try a bunch of stuff.   NIGIRI   Yellowtail/Yuzu Yellowtail - this was my favorite of the items as the yellowtail was super fresh. The yuzu yellowtail has tomato and onion salsa on top which was pretty good texture.  Mackerel - had a solid brine on it and not too salty. They put a dab of cream on it which is different from other places but I liked it.  Garlic Tuna - the seasoning was what usually is on cajun albacore/salmon preparations and garlic ponzu.  Scallop - these were small scallops mixed with masago. I prefer larger scallop nigiri but this good.  Albacore/Cajun Albacore - also very fresh.   There really wasn't any bad fish today that I tried.   ROLLS   I love that they have riceless rolls! They don't do half rolls here so thats the only \"bad\" thing I can think about. I tried a few pieces of my friends rolls and they were good.   Q Roll - wasnt quite a roll but more fish tartare on a slice of cucumber, but the wasabi cream sauce on this was good.  Tuna Naruto - Im a sucker for cucumber wrapped rolls as they are refreshing and this was no different.   I love my ass- this was my only with rice roll order and the rice ratio was good.   APPETIZERS   Whos Your X Wife - this is a spicy tuna and cream cheese stuffed jalapeno. Standard, but good.  Service was friendly, but there were times that we had long waits. We sat in a booth and while we appreciated the booth dividers for privacy and so her kids wont bother the people next to us , it made it difficult to wave for a waiter since they can't see you. Im going to try to see if dinner and sitting at the sushi bar is a better experience next time.  The fresh fish and interesting offerings means I will return.",

Looking over the menu, I was so happy to see that they offered my favorite, the Lion Roll, which I've only found at one other sushi place in Henderson.  It turns out that the chefs at Jjanga (not that game Jenga) used to work at that Hendo joint, so now I don't have to go all that way to get my fix.  This place is new and was not that busy, which was just fine with us on this Hallmark holiday-no waiting for a table.  Very nice modern decor with wood accenting and quite roomy, this place doesn't feel like your traditional sushi restaurant.  Jung, our waiter du jour, was very friendly and attentive, making sure he answered any questions we had and kept the food and drinks coming. In addition to the Lion Roll, I liked the pumpkin soup, the Johnny Roll, and dessert, of course. Jjanga had a  Valentine's Day special: fried banana with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and chocolate sauce, a sweet ending to a great V Day meal. Jung even took our  picture with some new-fangled Polaroid type camera so they could hang our photo on one of the walls, posted with those of other customers. We got one to keep, as well. After such an enjoyable and filling meal, we know that we shall return.",

These guys as a team of chefs make dining for sushi the most fun you will at a sushi bar.  The atmosphere is very welcoming and the staff are awesome . I wish I could give it 10 stars. These guys are like family. The best experience is at the bar and that is where you get to make friends with these guys . They are funny and very entertaining . Let choo choo drink with you . You will see what I mean. The quality you cannot beat and the service is awesome . To all the haters you obviously do not know a good quality fish and eat at some yippidy show boating spots .  When I go I alone will order 60+ nigiri plus rolls + appetizers  and they have never missed anything   This place is great for dates , family outings , friend gatherings and any special occasion.

    "text": "Vegas can never have too many all-you-can-eat sushi restaurants in my opinion. I love stuffing my face with all the sushi and rolls that I can muster. For $25.95, it's totally worth it. After trying a bunch of items, I'd have to say that their nigiri is better than their rolls. The unagi was the highlight of the meal for me. With its crispy charred edges giving way to a mildly sweet tender and meaty body, this fresh water eel was the best I've had at any AYCE spot. Other solid options were the tuna, halibut, yellowtail and red snapper. On the flip side, I wasn't crazy about the beef tataki nigiri because it was too rare and fatty than I would have liked.  My favorite roll was the tuna naruto (tuna, salmon, white fish, and crab wrapped in cucumber). I also tried the Hawaiian roll and Joe's special roll but both had too much sauce, either masking the taste of the fish or rendering the rice mushy and causing the roll to fall apart.  Other items tried were the gyoza and chicken katsu. Both were satisfying.  Food came out unusually fast, so I'll have to request them to pace it out more next time. Service was exceptional as they stopped by often to take additional orders, refilled water glasses, and inquired about our food.  3.5 Stars",

    "text": "So I'm usually pretty skeptical when it comes to places with less than 100, or even less than 50 reviews. I mean the restaurant can easily pay people or urge their friends to write great reviews for them...  But lo and behold, this places deserves all five stars.  It's a really new place. It opened on February 1st. We went there literally 2 weeks after its opening. The place was completely empty during lunch. Because they were pretty empty, we got to talk to the server and the sushi chef the entire time. According to them, the night before (February 14), it was packed and there was a full 1 and 1/2 hour wait. That's great for a new restaurant!  The sushi chef, Captain Choo Choo, was really nice and friendly. The staff seems very laid back and fun. They made some recommendations on the fish and rolls to try, one of which was the saba (mackarel), which can really be super fishy at some places. Fortunately, it was actually really delicious here. It was flavorful without having that extremely fishy after taste. I was definitely impressed with that choice.  All of the nigiri that we ordered had fresh, delicious fish. None of them left a bad taste in my mouth. Some memorable ones were the halibut and the yuzu yellowtail. Both of them had light sauce, which didn't overpower the light flavors of the fish.  They also have sushi burritos, which have gained popularity since it popped up in norcal. I ordered the monkey burrito, These sushi burrito options usually come with tempura shrimp, some sort of raw fish, rice, and a soy paper wrap. It was definitely a big portion, but it was delicious!  Unfortunately at lunch, they don't offer the full menu, so we couldn't try the steak, uni (sea urchin), ebi (sweet shrimp), sashimi options, and the mochi ice cream.   All in all, it's one of my favorite ayce sushi places. I think it tops Goyemon, at least for their lunch. They were nice enough to give us stamp cards even though we're from out of town, so we'll definitely be back soon!",

    "text": "Jjanga is my new favorite Sushi Restaurant! I have not written a review in a long time, but the food and service at Jjanga is top quality.   We had the great pleasure of being served by the Sushi Hero Captain Choo at the bar. At some point it just became an Omakase situation. I was unable to find a fault with any aspect of Jjanga.   We pretty much ran the gauntlet on the Nigiri section and not one piece disappointed. So if you want my opinion as to what you should order, close your eyes and point because its all good. I have a few friends who usually do not like things like Saba, Unagi or Tako. I would take them here because Jjanga could change their minds. I personally think they have the best cure on Saba in town.   I am not a big sushi roll person but there are a lot of selections on the menu that excited my taste buds. I am still riding a food high right now so I will have to get back to you with a list of what rolls we tried. I have never had a riceless roll before, but Sushi Hero Captain Choo has introduced me to some great dishes. He also made a couple of special dishes for us which I am still smiling about three hours later. It pays to let him have creative license on your sushi. After a few orders he seemed to have nailed our preferences. He's a great chef. Also met Jjanga himself and I can't wait to eat his food. They were all super cool and fun.  So the sushi is excellent. No questions about that. The appetizers are equally as great. If I was a fish, you would catch me by using Fried Chicken as bait. Jjanga is now my favorite chicken wing place. I do not suggest things often, but I would not hesitate to recommend the Chicken Wings. Jjanga could sell that alone and I would still be a regular. The Bulgogi is also perfectly executed. The memory of the Bulgogi has me salivating as I write about it. The meat and the marinade are perfect IMO. Try that too. If Jjanga sold Galbi it would be my favorite Korean restaurant as well lol.  Well this review is already too long. You get the picture. I really like this place. High quality food and service with great prices. Easy 5 Stars.",

I went for dinner on a Sunday night and waited about 15 minutes for a table for 2.. another couple walked in a few minutes after we arrived and weren't seated until we were getting ready to pay and leave. During the week is a bit less crowded.  Prices are not bad either.. Would recommend AYCE if you're hungry, but 3 rolls split between 2 was enough for me.",

Staff is great very attentive and they work as a team which is nice to see. Highly recommend this place to everyone who likes sushi and quality service.",

But, not that Jjanga has opened his own sushi restaurant it is the best of both worlds, including excellent sushi and a fun atmosphere. Jjanga has the best sushi in town, it is fresh, tasty and unique rolls.   My favorites are the superman burrito, freshmen roll, something wrong 69 and the mixed Karai has such a great flavor and spice. Their screaming orgasm is the best I have ever had. My favorite nigiri items are the garlic tuna, Cajun albacore and yuzu yellowtail.   This place has my favorite sushi chefs, delicious sushi and a fun party atmosphere... What more could you need for a sushi meal? I am so happy for Jjanga and will continue to drive the 10+miles for the delicious food!!! Woooo Jjanga!!",

We had Hamachi, that was the ugliest color and tasted so HORRIBLE!  It did not look like your typical Buttery Hamachi.  The other Nigiri was just All Right! Nothing special and tasted a bit dated but not too much.   We had AYCE and the Side Items they serve.... #1 the Mussels... Good Quality but FLAVOR FREE.  They had absolutely no flavor what so ever despite their desperate attempt to put some sort of Teriyaki Mayo combination on them.  Just give me steamed Mussels then.   Golden Scallop... This title suggested a Seared Scallop , cooked to perfection. Not some Frozen Food, Deep Fried Scallop that was so dry it was Laughable.   The Crab Balls,  DISGUSTING.. All this is , is the inside mixture of a California roll, Minus the Avocado and Minus the Cucumber Deep Fried in a Tempura Batter topped with a Yum Yum Sauce.  Did I mention they use Korean Seaweed Paper in lieu of the traditional Japanese Nori which tastes horrid with sushi.   I am Korean and appreciate all things asian however this place sucks. Service is wack, they are all cute and nice with their greetings like any other thrown together Sushi fad but that is the extent of it.    If you are a sushi snob like myself then steer clear from this place.",

I just know that when I want AYCE sushi, there are other places near JJANGA that do it better.   Both of my visits have been for lunch, right at opening (11:30 am), and I sat at the bar.  On both visits, waitress service was on point. No orders were forgotten, and drinks always refilled.   On my first visit, Choo-Choo was the sushi chef. He was great, tons of personality, and he hooked us up with his special off-menu creation which was delicious. On my second visit, I overheard the person seated next to me ask the chef to just make him his favorite, off-menu creations. The chef told him he would only do that if the customer paid the higher AYCE dinner price, which I thought was pretty lame.   For nigiri, I find JJANGA's offerings to be ok.. decent enough fish quality and fish/rice ratio.  For rolls, some of the speciality rolls sound like they could be interesting, but sadly most of the ones I have tried have fallen flat flavor-wise. And I can't get past that weird pink sauce that is on some of them...  I did like the rice-less Tuna Naruto a lot though!  Overall, I suppose JJANGA would do in a pinch, if other spots were too busy. Personally, I prefer to do my ACYE sushi eating up the street at another spot though...",

The young Asian man with the glasses was extremely nice. The atmosphere is very clean and modern. The prices are reasonable for what you get, the food is amazing! I always get the All You Can Eat (Lunch is 21.95 - Dinner is 25.95) but I only recommend this if you are HUNGRY. Today I could only finish 3 rolls, so I'm not sure if I wasted or saved money by choosing AYCE. Also it's not very different from Jjanga so you will not be lost or confused if you had loved the Jjanga that was here before like I did. This place will always be one of my favorites in all of Las Vegas.",

For the first time in my life, I was charged the leftover fee at an ayce sushi restaurant. The server didn't even let me know I was being charged extra. Had I known, I would have just forced myself to eat the last few pieces. It's too bad, I've liked this place, but I'll probably never return now. I'm left w a sour taste. I'll just stick with Yama and sushi koma for now on.",

As with Jjanga, we had the option of ordering off the A La Carte menu instead of AYCE. Items I would order again are: California roll, spicy crab roll, & bulgogi. The Sushi Ya Box (with a choice of salmon, bulgogi, and chicken teriyaki), salad, tempura, and Cali roll seems like the best value. The Sushi Ya Box is $11.95 for dinner and less if you come for lunch. Music sound level is set to a nice low level, which is nice and seating is comfortable.",

We were the only people in the entire restaurant. So it was super quiet and relaxing. Fish was fresh and the rolls were so good. Def my fave AYCE sushi spot in Vegas (both locations) but this one was perfect since it was Monday lunch and a good peaceful vibe.  Menu has a great variety of appetizers, cut/hand rolls and speciality rolls. A few things on the dinner menu are not on the lunch menu like bulgogi, but who's cares. Totally worth it for 21.00 and I'm excited to go back.",

We saw some ad for it on Facebook or Instagram a few weeks ago.  Anyway, when we walked inside we were seated right away. We were surprised it wasn't crowded as it was 5pm on a Saturday night. There were only 3 other pairs and a small group in the restaurant the whole time we were there (about an hour).  Our server was so helpful & gave us exceptional service. My boyfriend had AYCE & I just opted for a la carte. The food was so amazing and with the added amazing service and cozy environment it definitely is our new sushi go-to!  Next time I'll definitely get the all you can eat option as I was super jealous watching my man eat whatever he wanted...  Also! When you go you haveeee to get the melon ice cream bar for dessert!",

Food was served a lot faster than anywhere else we have been in Vegas.  Usually we go once during each visit, well this last time, we went twice and truthfully  wanted to go a 3rd time.   If u try it, you have to try the spicy pork. They serve it to you sizzling on the pan and it's just deliciousness glazed magic in your mouth. A MUST  when you visit....I want to go back sooner than our next scheduled visit solely for SUSHI YA!!!!!!",

They have the toothpicks and floss handy in case you need them, I've never seen that anywhere!  The variety of rolls are so delicious and they even have them divided to a spicy column only, which I enjoy. I had a few rolls but my ultimate favorite of all time was the Golden Bridge!!!! It has fried plantains on top! It was the mosy delicous thing I've ever had!   Preceded to pay at the price was not what was told on the phone so the cashier accomadated us. Which she didn't have to do, but them going an extra mile to satisfy a client is always a plus. Possibly my new favorite sushi spot!",

It's $20.95/person for lunch till 3pm, then 25.95/person for dinner! Pretty reasonable prices for the quality of the fish & their extensive menu.   However, out of everything I ordered, I would not recommend the cocain special sashimi and the spicy garlic edamame.   The servers were attentive & the service was quick. Erica was our server and she was amazing!! We never had to wait for our orders to come out which was great b/c we were starvingg  Definitely recommend this place if you're looking for some AYCE sushi in Vegas.

The crab ball was delicious.  Always love a cucumber salad to add a refreshing touch.  Salmon nigiri was perfect.  I don't eat a lot of carbs and ratio of rice to fish is on point here!!

I guess I just didn't wanna have to deal with all the madness and crazy sushi prices on the strip. Anyway, we ordered a good amount! We got the dinner price so that we could get the \"special\" items, like sea urchin, sweet shrimp, etc. I think the uni could have been a little more fresh, but it was still good. They only allow one order per person, which is fine. The other sushi was still fairly good for AYCE. I love the variety and expansive menu for AYCE. I would definitely come back again if I'm in the mood for AYCE sushi in Vegas.",

    "text": "Not a lot people know about Jjanga yet so it was pretty easy to get a table on a Friday night that we went. The chefs and servers are Korean.  Nigiri: We tried a bunch of nigiri: salmon, garlic tuna, amaebi, surf clam, Cajun albacore, super white and hamachi. Fresh fish and properly-cooked rice. Beef tataki was awesome! 5/5  Salmon Skin Roll: Crispy salmon skin, right amount of eel sauce. 5/5  Screaming Orgasm and Sashimi Salad: These items are only offered during dinner. The sauce is not a lot and is just enough to coat the fish. 4/5  Beef Steak and Pork Steak: The beef steak is served on a sizzling plate but the flavor is lacking. There's nothing special about it. The pork steak was fatty and pretty tasty. 3/5  Shrimp Tempura: Comes in 3 pieces per order. The sauce was ok but the shrimp didn't seem fresh and the batter was a but saltier than normal. 3/5  Agedashi Tofu: The tofu is served lightly battered and fried and the sauce is good. 4/5  Uni: They originally told us they were out of uni. But a few minutes later, we got a small bowl of uni. It is quite fresh. 4/5  French Fries: I love fries so I got excited when I saw this on the menu. I had to have it. Their fries were just alright. It lacks flavor and seems hollow inside. 3/5  What's nice is they offer brown rice. Their lunch AYCE is $21 and dinner is $26 so, it's not bad. The service is good. They gave our food to the next table and vice versa but it's no biggie.  This place is rather new so I'm not surprised their sushi is fresh and they have a good rice to fish ratio. It would be interesting to come back here after a few months to see if they'd be consistent since most sushi places in Vegas start out good but as months go by, quality and service declines.",

There's also an \"All You Can Eat\" (AYCE) dinner option for $25. My family and I ordered a la carte which was enough for everyone. I would say the rice and fish ratio is pretty fair. The chefs don't skimp you on the fish nor do they over stuff the maki rolls with rice.   My favorite specialty rolls (not a huge sauce fan): -Arizona Roll -Spring Mountain Roll  Beware of the wait. Wait time seems to vary due to the AYCE option, but the staff is pretty efficient and friendly. Also, they have karaoke rooms on the other end of the dining area. The karaoke side doesn't seem to be very disruptive to the dining patrons... at least I didn't hear any random wailing sound during our meal. Overall, we enjoyed our time at JJANGA and will recommend this place to other visitors.",

Everything we ordered was pretty unique, especially the no rice rolls.  Our server, Kara, was also very attentive and friendly. The place had a nice, chill vibe to it since we came on Labor Day and everyone was probably dead from partying. Overall this place is a good sushi place to stop by and try :)",

    "text": "Good but not as great as Sushi Koma.  I used to work down the street and we'd come to Jjanga since it was a mere 5mins drive.  The rolls here are huge!  It takes almost 2 bites to eat 1 piece, so be conservative when you're ordering AYCE and ask for 1/2 rolls instead.  Fish is fresh but rolls are very drenched in sweet eel sauce or mayo sauce.  I am a fan of nigiri so heavily sauced rolls is not for me.  Coworkers are always happy to come here.  Plenty of rolls and appetizers offering on the menu.  We've never had to make a reservation or wait long for a table here during weekdays lunches.  Not a bad spot to visit if you're near the Strip",

Our initial server was rather rude and disinterested in being there. She was reluctant to explain the concept to one of our guess. Fortunately she was replaced by someone much more attentive Sushi was simply excellent and just the right small amount of rice combined with super fresh ingredients. In addition they have Uni which is a must for me. Their rice-less rolls were interesting but did not have wow factor. Poke and sashimi salad was great. Stay away from the sushi burritos, too much rice and fake crab.  Overall I will definitely be back to try it again",

It is no longer the JJANGA I've been coming to for years. The menu is much smaller. All the staff and chefs are new. We waited to get service the whole night while they focused on one table. There was much attitude from the server when asking just for a sauce on the side. In the end he wouldn't take our punch card which was full and he said they were under new management and don't take them any more. They just need to change the name of the restaurant! I have nothing bad to say about the Fort Apache location and will drive across town to go to that one! My family and I will never return to the Decatur location. So rude. The food wasn't worth it either. Sushi Way is the best AYCE in Vegas!",

We did a la carte & the portions were just right!   The quality of the food is to die! The fish in the sushi tasted to FRESH! I had to BURNING YOUR ASS* roll & it was bomb! So much flavor & it's not as spicy as it sounds lol   All the servers were awesome! GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! I myself am a General Manager of a restaurant so I appreciated great service! Lucy was my favorite server! She hung out with us & chatted a bit with us- we got to know her a little & she made our experience a great & fun one with non stop laughter!   GO TO JJANGA!!

I don't see why we shouldn't be seated since no one is using any seat and all seats are cleaned.   Price here is much cheaper than other sushi. Roll for $3 Baked salmon and avocado. Naruto is the best. The sauce is coconut or cream. Taste pretty good. Miso taste like bleach water. I don't know why. I have tasted many miso but I have never taste anything like so. After coming here tasting bleach miso I decided to try the pumpkin soup. The pumpkin soup taste like American pumpkin soup with no cream or pumpkin spice. Just pumpkin! I thought it will have something Japanese or Korean flare. No sesame. No nori or seaweed. Nothing. I want to order uni but was advice it is for dinner only, but when I looked at it I thought I can add $3 to the a l a cart price. OOOps my bad.   Atmosphere is dimmy and pretty cook. Had a few Iron Chef pictures. Services is pretty good compare to the JJANGA on Fort Apache x Russell. That's a very confusing place. The whole place have only a few buffet and bar seats and the rest on grill and no one can seat at the grill. Waited for 15 minutes.",

Let me highlight my favorite parts:  Our server was so helpful, especially because we did the all you can eat for $26. He suggested his favorites and also asked us what we liked so he could make suggestions off that. He was personable and funny, never making us feel rushed even though he was really busy!   Everyone working there was working together. Our table got bussed by multiple people, our drinks always stayed full, and we never had to wait to order more.... And everyone was smiling!   The sushi was fantastic, all made to order.   Did I mention the all-you-can-eat sushi is $26 at dinner?! :D   The variety on the all you can eat menu is epic!

Music is good and food is even better.  Tried this new place out after our Jabbawockeez show for my 1 year/Valentines Day celebration and I couldn't be happier. The bf and I are huge beef lovers and we were so excited to find out that they serve a roll with actual seared steak on top!Jjanga himself made us an amazing steak dish with a delicious ginger/mustard sauce that was absolutely to die for! Never heard about this dish or sauce anywhere else before.  We also tried all of their appetizers since we were doing AYCE and it was so tasty! We had the pumpkin soup which was rich, creamy, yet light all at the same time. The best juiciest and plump baked green mussels I've ever had at a sushi joint too (super happy about that!) The atmosphere was very enjoyable. The way the place is setup is really interesting but it all makes sense. There's a separate side to the left where they have rooms where you can rent for karaoke (going to try that at least once!) The music was playing throughout just loud enough to still enjoy dinner. The staff was so funny and made us laugh throughout the night.  I am telling everyone about this place because I'm expecting to return as many times as possible. I know I'll never be disappointed every time I go.",

I liked that the portions were smaller so you could try a little bit of everything without being full after the first plate.  This was probably the absolute fastest service I have ever had. Before we were done one plate, the next was being brought over.  Like, within minutes.  Crazy.  Only complaint is that at the end of the  meal, our server basically went awol.  Couldn't be found anywhere, so it took about 20 mins to get the check and get out of there.  I would definitely return next time I'm in town!",

Overall atmosphere of the restaurant is clean and fancy. You can guess their food and service to be nice just because they just opened but, ever since my first visit, i've been going there every week now and their service is getting better and better each week! they are getting busier every week too which is a positive thing. I guess that everyone feels the same way as I do about this place.  Foods are great, comes out fast and sometimes special sashimi orders come out to from the sushi chef which is unusual compare to any other restaurant that does AYCE.  The quality of fish are amazing! so does the kitchen orders. When I usually dine in for AYCE place, I do not bother ordering any of the kitchen foods but JJANGA is different. On top of all the nice sushi and rolls, there are delicious kitchen foods. It's as if I have to come back the next day to just to AYCE kitchen foods. lol   This is the only place I dine in now for sushi.",

Even with the \"Happy Hour\" for late night ($20 lunch price instead of the $25 dinner price after 9 pm or something like that) the place is still on my shit list.  First, the rolls were small and the portions of the appetizers were TINY.  An order of agedashi tofu literally means one cube of tofu.  An order of seaweed salad is about 2 inches in diameter.  An order of the garlic gingko is 3 gingko nuts plus a ton of garlic (which, if I may add, we were asked about why we did not finish. Yes, they expected us to finish all slices of the garlic that were used to stir-fry the darn nuts -- don't even get me started there).  That brings me to my second point.  The waiters stand over you and won't clear the table unless you've finished literally every freaking bit of the meal.  We ordered the udon noodles and they didn't clear our bowl because there was still some soup at the bottom.  No kidding.  I get that they don't want to waste food, but it felt more like eating in prison.  And most importantly, the food just didn't taste right - period. I started getting a stomachache in the middle of the meal.  Never again.",

Lots of options on the menu one of my favorite place to visit. If you a beginner or a pro sushi eater you will find something u like here. The place is very upbeat and great environment to visit with friends. Easy to find parking and open late. So many great things about this place.",

The only bad thing is they remodeled this place and they did a horrible job. The booths used to be super secluded and romantic and the remodeling they did totally changed the vibe. The Durango location is equally good so maybe check that location out first.",

    "text": "\"WHO SAYS SUSHI? I SAY SUSHI, LET'S GO GET SOME SUSHI\"  5STARS, this place is tucked away on the side of Grn Valley Grocery on Decatur/Twain.  Please do not be frightened by the surrounding location, ok so it's a little hood but if you are driving along that area of town you already know this.  We went in w/ a game plan (don't drink a lot of water, don't over do it on the appetizers, and no need to rush and stuff you face 'despite how good it may be' PACE OURSELVES)  EPIC FAIL: it was so GOOD, that I could not stop. We started off w/ spicy garlic endamame, shrimp tempura and seaweed salad.  SEAWEED SALAD: fresh, nice crunch, it is not soggy and oversaturated w/ dressing.  You have the pleasure of enjoying both the crunchy-ness of the seaweed and the sweet/tangy-ness of the dressing.  I'm not big on cream cheese and sushi rolls but the FAT ASS: a mixture of tuna, salmon, tuna w/ cream cheese and a mayo sauce. oh yea, and its DEEP FRIED.  The cream cheese is not the STAR of the roll, I find that rolls w/ cream cheese tend to be heavy w/ cream cheese.  This was not, the variety of fish that this roll is made of is the STAR.  Other rolls we tried: Crazy ASS Joe Special Tiger Roll Crunch Roll I Love My ASS XXX  ok, so I'm fascinated w/ A$$, these rolls are so good though, ijs.  I want to say that they have almost close to 100 rolls on the menu, the even have SUSHI BURRITOS (which I will try on my next visit)  All in All I'm hooked on this place, no not because it's walking distance from the house (it's a (+) that is walking distance) but it is AWESOME quality fish being served.  Very nice atmosphere, the restaurant is lighted and clean. (you're not sitting in the dim lighted room, trying to make out what placed in front of you.  The staff is Amazing and so nice, don't let the outside appearance detour you from enjoying GREAT sushi inside.",

Getting to the place seems pretty sketch and a little hard to find, but trust me that the find is definitely worth it !!!! The restaurant is so modern looking and really nice. I like how they have the paper lanterns placed around the restaurant. I guess you could say the ambiance is really nice (:  Went there for the dinner AYCE and I was definitely not disappointed ! Everything was super super super yummy ! I really enjoyed the Spicy Garlic Edamame ! It's a must try bcs it's something different than the usual plain salted ones. Also for appetizers, their seaweed salad is very fresh and yummy (: and I'm so happy they have FRIES ! Bcs I'm a fry addict, although I did not have the chance to taste theirs. & definitely try out their meat appetizer selection bcs it's very tender and juicy ! I love MEAT !   Going into the rolls ! BACON BACON BACON ! It definitely stood out, their bacon roll. I was a little skeptical bcs it said \"fruit sauce\" but don't be hesitant !!!!! ORDER IT ! It's very light sauce and soooo delicious ! Everything just compliments each other ! It's so perfect, especially for those adventurous people out there. My favorites included the Tuna Naruto ! It's really refreshing ! And does not have that over powering cucumber taste that I know may throw off some guests. And it's also cool how they have sushi burritos !!!! They are very unique to the menu, but it was just like a normal roll. I did enjoy the sauce though.  The best part of the night was the EXCELLENT SERVICE ! Definitely top-notch Grade AAAAA++++ service in any sushi restaurant I have ever been to (and I have been to plenty) ! JayJay (or JJ) was the best host there & he even sang to us, which was pretty great and random. Everyone is really friendly and fun ! & most important, well attentive and available when needed !   The only reason for not having 5 stars would be that there are ZERO pics of how their sushi would look like before you order ): it's like a surprise in a box & I had to refer to trusty ol' yelp to give me a sneak preview. And also, I had one roll that the fish was not as fresh as could be & also in my poke salad, one fish piece was not that super fresh either.   But I WILL DEFINITELY RETURN ! They have stamp cards & this is probably my top favorite sushi place in Vegas at the moment (: even above the beloved Goyemon and my other fav Yama sushi.  *******On my other visits, the service was okay. They always walk pass by us. & it's hard to even get an order in, there's usually a wait on our rolls. They need to sort this out & assign someone to serve each table.",

(My favorite is the threesome special and the choo choo special--off the menu!) The servers are always friendly, and even when I don't finish all my food, they NEVER charge me lol.   There was actually one time my cousin and I had to tap out with probably a good 2 and a half rolls left. We were expecting to be charged for the leftovers, which we were fine with, but we decided to still order our dessert anyway lol. So we stopped our waiter to try and order some ice cream but he saw our leftovers and was like \"Sorry guys, there's just so many leftover pieces, we aren't allowed to give ice cream.\" But we totally understood, considering how much food was still on the table. But 5 minutes later he came back with bowls of ice cream for everyone and said, \"I felt really bad telling you guys no, so I just brought you guys ice cream anyway.\" AND we weren't charged for the leftovers lol. So coming from a personal experience, I can definitely say that the service is impeccable lol.  I'm giving them a 4 not a 5 though because I feel like they could add more to their dessert menu lol but that's just me. I'd give them a 4 1/2 if I could, but I can't. Sorry Jjanga lol.",

Ive tried to look for a new spot but nothing came even close. that is till I found out the old crew are all in a new location. Well hello there JJanga! First time I came here, I saw all of the crew, even some of the servers. Felt like home lol Ive been back here so many times after that.  Today, I was craving for some fried rice cake but I was told they were currently out of it. Bummer! But we had the regular sushi, sashimi and rolls. Awesome as always.   We always order fried baby squid(extra crispy). Yum-O! Sorry squidward.   I was happy they included the age dashi tofu to their AYCE menu. Its a must for me. This and the rice cake.   And this is the only place that caters to my extra strong ice green tea. Thank you guys.   I tried the threesome special. It has spicy tuna, crab, soft shell crab but it had me with deep fried cream cheese. Come on! Cream cheese?? And its deep fried?? Me likey!   Now for the staffs... everyone was great as always. Nothing new there. All were attentive, nice and fast. Too bad choo choo wasn't there. He's a riot!  This particular lady server was too sweet when I was ready to pay she asked me if Im full already and if I still want the rice cake? Turned out it was just delivered. Aawww... bless you.   The location is now a bit far from my place. But close to my favorite boba place lol. Its clean, organized and well lit. There's tv and background korean songs. Love it! Can you guys play more 2ne1 songs, please???  I will definitely come back unless you guys move again! Please let us know",

The food.....oh the food. Appetizers selection is amazing, alcohol is great at a good price. The sushi is a reason to come here every other week. From the sashimi, the nigiri to the main selections of maki (rolls), its simply cannot be beat in terms of flavor.   Recommended roll: Something Wrong #69. This roll has been my favorite for the past 8 years and I simply praise Jjjanga for having this on their menu (used to go to another place for it until quality fell). Come here during the weekday night for it might become a bit packed during the usual high-times of the week but other than that its just worth the wait.   Hands down Jjanga is a must for anyone who loves sushi here in the Valley and I will always come back here as my go to place for AYCE here in Vegas.",

However, my doubts were instantly shattered as soon as I entered the restaurant. The place is clean and well-lit, and the employees immediately greeted us.  My boyfriend and I chose to sit at the bar. There are huge banners with pictures of each chef along with their names, which I found really charming. The head chef, who goes by \"Captain Choo Choo\", is really funny and charismatic. He went out of his way frequently during our visit to make sure we were having a great time.  The food was absolutely delicious. It was decently priced - the most expensive food items were only $8. The chefs really make sure that the food they make is up to par before they hand it to the customers. I highly recommend the Volcano roll and the Threesome special most of all!  Overall, this place is great! The food is great, the chefs are great, and they even have karaoke rooms in the restaurant! I WILL be back here one day, that's for sure.",

    "text": "I love ALMOST everything about this place. :-)  Let's see, FANTASTIC prices on regular rolls for to go. $3 for rolls such as spicy scallop, spicy tuna, california roll, yellowtail roll etc. These rolls are normally $5.50 everywhere else.  So when I'm not up to paying for all you can eat, I load up on 4 or 5 rolls to go and only pay $15 vs $25+ for the same amnt.   AYCE - I love that they have several rolls that don't include rice and are wrapped in cucumber. I have always enjoyed these and it's rare to find and Sushi Koma has 1 available but it's very small and you're only allowed to order 1. Here you can order it as many times as you like.   Reverse Happy Hour after 11 pm (you only pay the lunch price of all you can eat) HELL YEA!!!    My ONLY... complaint is their spicy tuna is made a bit differently than other places.  It's definitely not bad, I've never been sick from here or anything like that, but it does definitely taste a bit different and I'd almost say a bit more fishy tasting.    Otherwise..  GREAT prices, menu, food/quality, and wonderful service!  I have been here several times already and I will continue to come back.   The location is a bit tough to get to, parking is very very minimal and the restaurant is in a small plaza. but it's definitely worth it, and once you're inside, it's beautiful.   I definitely recommend this place to anyone for both AYCE and regular menu with low prices.",

The service was a little slow and they took forever to give us our check and to come back for it so we ended up going to the front to pay. Other than that the food was good minus the hair and service.",

The place itself is very comfortable - dim lights, tasteful decor, and music that plays loud enough to where you can still hear.   Half of our group got AYCE and the other half ordered a la carte. The food came out very quickly, and everything tasted wonderful. Even the Sapporo tasted better here! ;) If you don't mind a little spice, I highly recommend the spicy edamame as an appetizer, and the gyoza if you're really hungry. The crunchy roll was also delicious. I can't wait to go back!",

The key to determining good sushi is in tasting the sashimi and this my friends was the freshest and tastiest you can get at an AYCE sushi place. The color of the fish was vibrant and it tasted like butter.  The creativity and quality of the rolls are excellent and there is always someone walking by trying to take your order. Just the best and I cannot wait to make this our weekly sushi spot!",

They would make us specialty rolls  based on the other things we ordered without us even asking. The price is unbelievable. Two of us had appetizers, soup, salad, tons of sushi, dessert and drinks for under $100 total.  This will definitely be a \"must have\" every time I come to Vegas.",

    "text": "One of the best AYCE sushi joints you can find in the west part of Vegas! My last visit was one of my most enjoyable AYCE experiences at a reasonable price. All of the rolls were unique and creative. Not one of the rolls was left unfinished. Their nigiri was fresh tasting except for the uni.. Which was a shame! But at least the fish to rice ratio was just right.. Only a little bit of rice with a nice cut of fish. My group came in around 7-8pm and it was pretty busy! It's my second time here so we'll see how today's Dinner AYCE compares to last time's experience!  1/8/2015:  Came in around 3:30pm.. With a group of 4. Kind of empty.. And seemed like a few sushi chefs in the back were working at a steady pace. The first thing I noticed was that our food came out at a much slower pace.. Practically one plate/roll at a time with pauses in between. Me being an AYCE type of guy, this \"portion control\" kind of bothers me. Didn't experience that last time. Although it's not too much of an issue because everything that came out was delicious!   The favorites for nigiri were the yuzu yellowtail, Cajun albacore, beef tataki and the garlic tuna. Even the uni had a much fresher taste. Each roll was pretty good, too. Don't remember the names, although I did prefer the special rolls over and of their baked/fried rolls. Also, the baked mussels and the oysters were pretty basic but tasty nonetheless. Other dishes/appetizers that stood out were the mini pork steak?? the baby octopus and the baked dynamite.  Also beware!! They sometimes either miss an item or forget your order.. This probably doesn't happen to everyone, but just a little reminder to the waiter/waitress is a simple solution.  All in all this place does it for me! Although, I keep this place in rotation when it comes to AYCE. There are too many sushi joints in this town to keep count.. This place deserves a solid 4.5 for the food and ambience. Plus, they have stamp cards for AYCE",

I had a couple other rolls (eel and something else) and neither really stood out.  If you're ball'n on a budget and she wants sushi, their AYCE sushi should be considered.

    "text": "Hidden gem!  Some of the best sushi I've had in a long time.  Honestly, read no further and go to the restaurant, you won't be disappointed.  Here's why:  We were staying at Mandalay bay and wanted sushi but not looking at spending a lot of money.  We rented a car and I was a little nervous we would not use it but wow I was wrong.  We've used it everyday to find awesome restaurants like this one.  I was craving sushi but did not want to spend over $100 and I knew if we stayed on the strip we would.  So I found this place on yelp, I was skeptical because it was all you can eat,  it's way off the strip, in a strip mall and it appears to be in shady area of town (I'm from Chicago, what do I know).  But let me tell you this place was a lot fun!  The food, the environment, everything was great.  First, the environment was very welcoming.  My wife and I sat at the sushi bar and Choo Choo (sushi chef) was awesome! He was a ball of energy, entertaining, funny, he made the experience great!  Now the food was surprisingly super good.  The fish was super fresh, soft, the tuna melted in my mouth.  I was super impressed how fresh the fish was.  I have many food allergies and they were very accompanying, made changes to the rolls for me and gave me suggestions.  The wait service was just okay, hard to track down for the bill but the sushi chefs made up for them with there energy, enthusiasm and entertaining factor.  Lastly the price, cheapest meal of the trip, so crazy!  We opted out of the all you can eat and just ordered.  Our bill was only $38 after taxes and we had sake.  If I'm ever back in Las Vegas I will absolutely eat there and I'm going to recommend it to everyone I know.  If your looking to have fun, eat great food, and not pay a lot, then I highly suggest.  You will definitely need to take a cab or drive here but it's well worth it.",

    "text": "Quite possibly the worst dining experience we've ever had. We wanted to try a new place and because of all the great reviews we decided to come to Jjanga. We were pleased upon entering, the music was cool, the decor was very nice and we were greeted promptly. Once seated we were handed menus and expected to give our order immediately. We decided to do the all you can eat. Aside from the nigiri, all of the rolls use the cheapest imitation crab mixed with lots of mayo. Most of the items use really poor ingredients. The Hawaiian Roll had veggies in it!? Who does that?! For example, in the sashimi salad there was iceberg lettuce, like the kind from a salad mix at the grocery store. The best items was the mochi which was probably store bought too. Definitely not a real sushi restaurant. I guess all of the rave reviewers have never had good, quality sushi.",

    "text": "I want to start this review by asking you to do an experiment.   Naturally you're probably too lazy or disinterested to do it but hopefully my point will get across either way.   Do a search for \"Sushi\" on Yelp and look at the results.   Go pages deep.  Nearly all of them garnering 3.5-5 stars.  Wow, Vegas sure does have a lot of AMAZING Sushi restaurants doesn't it?   Either that or there are a lot of people who love Sushi no matter where they get it and generally have a very pleasant experience each and every time they have it.  Having talked to several friends and co-workers in which I believe this is the case, I've decided to implement a rule by which I will no longer go by high Yelp ratings for Sushi restaurants.   I get it, Sushi is delicious, but when I see a 4 and a half star average on a place I expect it to be unique in some sense and not simply another standard AYCE Sushi option, which is exactly how I found JJANGA to be.  This is by no means my way of saying JJANGA was bad.  Far from it   I went here for a co-worker's \"going away\" party, and we sat at the Sushi Bar.   Ricky was our sushi chef, and even though he was admittedly slow to start (it took a while before our sushi orders started landing in front of us), he was very pleasant and made our dining experience a fun one.   I wasn't extremely impressed with the Sushi, but I also wasn't disappointed.   JJANGA's AYCE menu reminded me most of \"I Love Sushi\"'s, with several sharing the same name.   Ricky confirmed that either some of the chefs or the owners came from \"I Love Sushi\".   Now I can go either way on Sushi:  on the one hand I like eating Nigiri where the freshness of the fish is going to really stand out, and on the other I also don't mind eating insane concoctions that are the specialty at places like this where fish plays second fiddle the the other components and sauces.   So we had our share of Nigiri and on the other side, rolls like \"Sexy Time\" and \"I love my ass\",   Everything was fine, but nothing really stood out to me as a reason to choose JJANGA over any other Sushi restaurant in town.   Okay I take that back, I decided I simply had to try to \"Bacon Roll\" because curiosity got the best of me.   I actually found it to be delicious as it tasted exactly as you or I would expect it to.    I do love saying the name of the restaurant though, which almost had me bump it up to a 4.   But then the entire point from the first paragraph would sort of be moot.",

My second time was tonight  for my friends birthday dinner. We expected to get a few drinks with dinner as well as take some sake bombs, but when we got there we found out they can't serve alcohol because their liquor license is expired...what!? Never had this happen before..but I brushed it off because we were still can grub on some good food. At the end of dinner, my friend ordered Uni (Sea Urchin). When they brought it out we instantly noticed it was a dark brown color, it's supposed to be yellow!! She tasted it and couldn't even get it down. I was surprised they served it to us! She told the manager that it made her feel sick...he apologized but didn't offer us anything. Normally when this happens to me at other restaurants they give you one complementary item. Although I do like this place, I have to knock off two stars for the expired liquor license and the spoiled Uni!",

They have amazing service they're always on it & quick with orders. The first time I went our server was JJ & he was hilarious & gave us an amazing experience. He even offered us some random roll to try out. Their nigiri is the main reason why I love this place, which is what I base my sushi places off of. It's always fresh fish & a good ratio of rice to fish. I love the super white tuna, salmon, unagi, & uni just to name a few. They have a good variety of appetizers (my fav is the baby octopus), rolls & also have a selection of sushi burritos. I prefer to come for lunch when it's less busy but even when it's busy they're still providing great service. I will always come here when I'm craving sushi!",

What a horrible mistake.  Tiny pieces of not so fresh fish. The smallest appetizers I ever seen.  Should mention ikura and uni. I am from Russia, so I know a thing or two about caviar. Black caviar and and red caviar (salmon roe). My guess is that salmon roe served to us in JJANGA, was stored in a refrigerator (not in a freezer, which is fine) for minimum 2-3 weeks. It was bitter and smelly!   I've eaten a lot of uni. A couple of times we even drove to CA just to get fresh uni. However, I must don't know enough about sea urchin, because I cannot imagine, how spoiled uni must be to turn BLACK?   I am not even going to talk about rolls. Will just mention that 99% of rolls are made form spicy imitation crab meat and cream cheese. I cannot call \"sushi\" cream cheese wrapped in rice. Thank you JJANGA for teaching me a lesson..",

    "text": "Simply put, best AYCE sushi in Vegas.  This place is so good, I'm not too sure where to start this review, but this is yelp, and it's always about the food itself.  Food here is just awesome. The fish is so fresh tasting, I would argue that it comes fairly close in quality to Noshi Sushi in Hollywood. Unlike Yama which precuts their fish (a decision I completely understand due to how busy they get), all the fish at Jjanga is sliced only when you order it. The fish to rice ratio in both their hand and cut rolls is spot on. They don't pile on the rice to fill you up faster, and the chefs are extremely generous with their portions. My favorite sushi here are the Yellowtail and Alaska hand rolls, which are just heavenly. The fish is so smooth, without any of the fishy smell and taste so common with cheaper sushi. Another amazing plus are their appetizers. I know it sounds strange, but try their plain chicken wings and the french fries. Hell, I'd come back just for those two. For their desserts, the red bean icecream is so fragrant and full of red beans, you'll with that you saved room for more than 1 cup. My only dislikes of the food would be some of the sauces they put on the sushi, but everything can be ordered without sauce. Additionally, their salads (Poke, shashimi, etc) are a bit weak when compared to their sushi lineup. If they made their salad like how Yama makes its shashimi salad, I would rate them 6 stars. As it stands, I would rate the food 5/5.  Service is also great. You aren't required to order with the same waiter who took your first one, if you want more food, just flag down any passing waiter. They don't mind the least and actually encourage it. Food is brought out at a constant pace instead of a giant glut common at other AYCE places, which helps keep the food at its correct temperatures. The servers are so friendly and I've never gotten the smallest hint of judgement for the sheer armount of food I consume. My only qualm is that once in a long while a small mixup will happen and an order might be forgotten, but since it's an AYCE, just order it again. Who cares if they forget? 5/5  Price/Ambiance/Cleanliness - Price is inline will most other places, ~21 for lunch, ~26 for dinner. Ambiance is casual but not too loud. Restrooms and entire restaurant kept pretty clean. No complaints in this one. 5/5  TLDR: Everything here is great, but also try the plain (must specify this) chicken wings and french fries. You'll thank me later.",

The biggest part of dining out for me is the experience, it can make or break a night out! This place is top for service, multiple servers bring you your food as it's ready, fill your drinks and keep you satisfied. Jjanga himself was comedy entertainment, even entertaining the one kid with us between the treasure chest, light up toys and verbal and nonverbal jokes!  The quality of the rolls, appetizers, soup and everything Inbetween was great! I can't even say what my fave was as we lost track as we all just kept ordering and tasting! They have great tuna poki! Great flavor and freshness! The appetizer selections were huge, I didn't have any but I know the crab balls were a hit at the table! The 6 no rice rolls were the favorites with the tuna one (forgot the name) and the fresh man rolls being top! The 69 tempura roll and the jackpot were also big hits! Great flavor popping in them all and nobody complained.... We must have ordered at least 25 things between all of us!  The mochi was great with the mango being my fave but chocolate and strawberry were hits!  I know we will be back... Jjanga knows we want tshirts and he is ok with us being corny and playing Jenga sushi at Jjanga! Oh and don't forget your frequent buyer card! The 10th is free!",

    "text": "Well color me disappointed :-/  friends and family came in from out of town and this is the place I present to them, go ahead and take away my sushi whore status. They weren't really disappointed but we all were drinking and enjoying each other company so the food really wasn't a focus. They were on a budget so the happy hour AYCE for $20 was a saving grace :-) only 2 out of the 6 people did AYCE. The ones that didn't did get a kick out of the low price of the rolls, but with those low prices corners will be cut.   The sushi was little rice and paper thin cut fish. I wasn't hungry so I just had a Joe's Special roll which sounded better than it actually was. The garlic sauce tasted like burnt garlic. The tuna was low quality and very thin. I also had a Philadelphia roll, not sure why I ordered it but I did. There is a reason the cost was $3, don't expect much more than a couple grains of rice and a sliver of salmon, with a nice chunk of cream cheese :-/ yuck! My two rolls plus tax and gratuity came out to $14. I'm not breaking the bank at all with that meal but I can still think of others places I rather eat for that amount.   The services was hit and miss, the new guy was very nice and helpful. He had zero clue what was going on but he ran to find out. I like that :-) I don't expect people to have all the answers but I do expect them to make a effort to find out. The seasoned pro that came to answer of question was lacking in the personality department. My cousin was placing her order with him and asked to keep out cucumber from her roll. He snapped back with a, well then you want a \"blah blah roll then!\" Sir, I don't know your damn menu! Don't snap at a customer and make us feel like we need to be better versed with your menu! At least the newbie dude chipper go get 'em personality won us all over.    I'm tempted to put this place at a 2 star but the prices reflect the quality so I'm keeping the 3 stars. I'm cool with never returning to this place. I rather spend more for sushi that puts a silly grin on my face :-) Just like everything else in my life, it's quality over quantity.",

My bf enjoyed his unagi bowl and had plenty of unagi for the price.  I found it funny that when my bf asked for soda the waiter responded with \"you mean tea?\" That was totally not what was asked.   One negative thing is that we waited forever for my sister's chicken katsu...i think they forgot to make it because it took a little longer when we inquired about her dish... and also it took forever to get our check. We had to ask twice to get it. Thus, this spot gets 3 stars. It was good but I won't be coming back any time soon.",

    "text": "WOW what an EPIC meal!  Hubs and I came here for AYCE sushi dinner and had to be rolled out.  Speaking of rolls, my only regret is not being able to try ALL of them.  The rolls all sounded so good and they were so creative with naming them!  Menu items like Burning Your Ass and the Playboy Special..FUN!  We only tried 2 rolls out of maybe 100 varieties because there were only 2 of us and the rolls were about 8 pieces each.  We ordered the Cowboy Special (since there was a cowboy convention this weekend in Vegas) and the Big Easy.  I really really wish I had my AYCE sushi buffet loving family of piggies back home in Toronto with me for this so we'd be able to try EVERYTHING!    This was definitely the BEST AYCE sushi dinner I've ever had.  Mind you I have no basis of comparison for the other AYCE sushi places in Nevada but I've probably eaten almost all of them back home in the Greater Toronto Area (there are a LOT of them there) and this one is no comparison.  The quality of the fish was excellent for an AYCE and they even had premium items on the menu like Tobiko, Uni, Amaebi, Beef Tataki, and Oysters.  Sure you were limited to 1 order (2 pieces) per person of these premium offerings but kudos for putting them on the menu in the first place.  We ate mostly off the Nigiri and Appetizer sections of the menu because of the small sizes and wanting more variety to try different things.  We also tried all of the special sashimi - all yummy!  I loved that even their simple sushi was not simple.  It wasn't simply a piece of fish slapped on top of rice.  Oh no, the fish was first perfectly seasoned, then placed on the rice (i.e. garlic tuna sushi - soooo good).  Also liked that their 1 serving portions were small so you were able to try different things.  I'm sure it wasn't easy making a dish with only 3 little baby octopuses on it.  They could have piled more on in one serving forcing you to be full on less items making it easier for the chefs.  And each item came out fresh and piping hot too.    Almost forgot to mention they have ICE CREAM MOCHI in the dinner dessert menu!  I LOVE ice cream mochi!  Drool!  Only downside was only 1 per person :(  We tried the green tea and mango.  Both were excellent.    Might have to drop in one more time before I leave sin city.    Ever consider opening up one north of the border?  Please?  :)  Omg how did I finish the review without praising the amazing hospitality from the servers?!?!  A server came by every few minutes to ensure everything was OK, drinks were topped up and see if we wanted more food!  Also everything that we ordered came out exactly as ordered and fast.  This might seem like a weird comment but in AYCE sushi places in Toronto its quite common that you put in an order and it doesn't come out so you order again and all of a sudden you get double your order.  OK, this time I am done :).",

I also loved the names of their rolls, so funny! Our sushi was fresh, fast, and very presentable. Sadly, I forgot to save some of my photos I shared on snapchat with some buddies!  Next time we go, we will have to bring friends to have some Karaoke fun!!",

Customer service has been great every time I've been here (which has been about 4 times so far, I think). Everyone's on point when it comes to clearing off empty plates & rolls come out quick so no complaints there.  On the AYCE, everything's categorized so that's great too. Just wish that the appetizer portions were bigger (i.e. that Agedashi tofu is delicious but I gotta order like 3 at a time for myself).  This location isn't too far from the Strip either and I think it's a convenient location cuz I drive from the NW side.  All in all... Love the garlic tuna. Love the fast customer service. Love the variety of rolls, appetizers, etc. I am now a regular!",

    "text": "I arrived just in time for the lunch special bento set.  You get a choice of two items listed and pair that with a bowl of rice and a miso soup or house salad.  I opted for the sashimi (3 pc), tempura and salad.  When I asked what is included in the sashimi, the waiter asked the sushi chef (I believe he was the owner).  The sushi chef asked what I liked and catered the sashimi order to my preference and threw in two extra pieces!  He was awesome!  What was even more awesome was the fact that the sashimi was excellent, good quality product.  I was eating as slow as possible to savor the flavors.  The sashimi was so good I got an order of the yuzu yellowtail.  The sushi rice had the right amount of moisture, the yuzu sauce was addictive and green on top added a nice crunch.  The tempura portion of the lunch was fine.  The breading was done well and it was not greasy, but I wish there was eggplant tempura.     The house salad was also fine.  The lettuce was fresh and crisp but the salad dressing was just okay.  I believe it was a mix of shredded carrots, mayo/salad cream and ginger.    After all that, the chef spontaneously offered me orange slices for dessert.  It was a nice way to end my meal.    As for service: overall, the sushi chef mentioned earlier is the star of this experience.  The other two servers on the floor were polite and friendly, but one did forget my water for about five minutes.    The part that was most surprising though was the price of my experience.  For five pieces of sashimi, two pieces of hamachi nigiri, bowl of rice, salad and six pieces of tempura:  under $12!     I am definitely a fan and I will definitely be back for the all you can eat!",

All of the sushi looks good on paper but 3 out of 5 of the rolls we ordered tasted and looked exactly the same. The service was dismal and when you asked about your order you were given the same excuse you'd hear them tell other tables. We asked about ordering something else on top of what we had been waiting for and the waitress didn't even listen to us and again stated the same excuse of why we had to wait for the sushi.. We said we knew that and were just trying to put in another order.. When your order finally came, it was thrown on your table. It took an hour for smoked salmon nigiri to come to our table.   When we got our bill we ended up finding out the waiter had calculated it wrong and instead of just bringing us the wrong calculated bill.. he voided it and charged us twice.   We only came to this sushi place because our normal place was too busy. Never again. Big mistake.",

    "text": "We do AYCE sushi quite often and are always looking for a new place to check out. A suggestion from a coworker led us here. The Dinner AYCE is $25.95, I'm pretty impressed with the quality of fish here. I primarily do all nigiri nowadays and avoid the rolls but the roll selection is pretty vast. The nigiri I got mostly was the salmon, I love salmon nigiri and it has become my favorite the quality of Salmon here was great.. the fat content made it seem more like a salmon belly cut, I loved it (got about 10 orders of it). I also had the garlic tuna which seemed super fresh as well and had a nice subtle citrus flavor which was light and flavorful.. also got some Cajun albacore which I am a big fan of as well, the Cajun Alb here had just a little too much citrus flavor in it, it wasn't bad but for a True Cajun Alb fan it didn't match up to my previous euphoric Cajun albacore experiences.. my girlfriend got a couple rolls, all of which were good and like I said the selection is vast! We normally go to Goyemon but sometimes don't feel like doing the waiting game.. if you find yourself in that predicament this is a nice alternative and is conveniently located  in Chinatown. The service was top notch and the sushi chefs at the bar were funny, super nice and welcomed any order with a smile. Check it out if you get a chance (you also get 10% off for yelping)",

I wasn't disappointed by anything I had there, of course I usually stay away from anything fried and with cream cheese but the rolls I had an nigiri were awesome! The Garlic Tuna was good. Ordered the amai ebi and you can ask for the deep fried head. I was in such an sushi eating frenzy that I didn't stop to note what I really loved. I will definetely be back and will have to take note to share next time! They also had a lot of appetizers if that is your preference.",

Miso soup was hot and hit the spot. There was a lot of sushi, so I'm not sure of the names, but they were really yummy. The soy beans were delicious. Finished dinner with mango mochi. Downside, you have to call the waiters to get your food, which is such a hassle, and sometimes the waiters have to tell someone else because they are not your waiter.",

The AYCE was one of the best (sushi category) that I've had. Far better than any I've had in San Diego (my hometown). And their AYCE menu is huge: nigiri, appetizers, sushi, sashimi, and even desserts! The sushi quality was good and their rolls were very flavorful and unique (not to mention most of them having phallic names).   And, as a group, we all thought the biggest reason this place deserves 5 stars (besides the awesome food) is because of the service. JJ, one of the servers there, was the coolest and funniest. He have the best recommendations, made us laugh, and just made the experience that much better. The owner was also pretty cool, hooking us up with mochi and a few other things here and there. We will definitely be visiting this place the next time in Vegas.",

In other words, they fill you up on rice. They had prompt service, and were fairly friendly but nothing to stands out at this place, even the large monitors playing non-stop K-pop is no longer the hip thing.  Also for parents, the names of some of the \"creative\" sushi rolls are either PG-13 or R-rated. What's invokes a chuckle or laugh to you as an adult, is inappropriate on a dinner menu.",

I only paid for what I ate and didn't pay for the Eel.he yelled at me and had crude comments even said he'd call the cops I told him to I had done Nothing wrong.  He talked to his manager and told me I cost them 17.00usd. My friend told him to stop yelling at me I was on the verge of tears. Im not a rude person and I felt I was harrassed by his rude comments and the fact he kept looking down my friends shirt.The manager stood there on his cell the whole time.   ..",

When I went there for the last time, they put so much rice in the sushi, the appetizer sucked (especially dynamic), all the sushi was so bad and not fresh. I stopped going there. I was very disappointed that they began to put so much rice.. Food qualities got worse and worse,,, It was pretty good in the beginning, I admit. But anyways, I haven't been to Jjanga for so long even though I collected all the stamps. Probably would never go back anymore.",

I yelped it and found this place. Food was dished/staged really well, servers were really nice and everything tasted great. They have an extensive ayce menu which can be overwhelming when you first see it, but who can complain about having choices right? We probably could have saved a few bucks and a few calories by opting for a la carte, but it's hard to make that decision when you're super hungry.  My advice? If you're not that hungry and usually get full off one roll or even two, go for a la carte. If you can put it down, opt for the ayce. My only gripe is that the kids ayce price is half the price of the adults meal, even though they don't even eat that much! I know it's standard fare, but I say reduce prices for kids!",

The ingredients were not as fresh as you would wanted....don't order anything with Unagi, it is disgusting.  However, some of the tofu dish was not bad and sushi was ok. They have one of those rule of not leaving food behind but this could be a touture when some dish doesn't taste good. If you have dinner buffet, they have sashimi salads in various way. Some of them with no mayo tasted much better than one with. Some of the appetizers were better tasting such as tofu, skewers and calamari. They do have various rolls and Maki for almost everyone's liking. Please note, if you are a hard core Japanese food person, this is not the place, but if you occasionally have Japanese food with your friends and family, you might like this place more than I do as they do have karaoke etc. I also saw lots of families dine here as well. This restaurant has 3 locations in Las Vegas, one on Decatur is the best one.",

And let me specify that I personally do not do rolls, just nigiri sushi and this is the best AYCE nigiri in Vegas. When I say that I mean that the sushi comes out perfectly seasoned and there is no  need to ad soy or wasabi, unless it is a matter of preference. This restaurant came very close to being my first five star restaurant but the kitchen items were only mediocre.  The tempura was a little greasy and undercooked, but I was really there for the sushi and it was EXCELLENT.   They were very busy but the waitresses still tried to be attentive.  They laughed because I ordered damn near everything on the menu.  I'm sleepy. G'nite!",

You can't ask for much more out of an AYCE other than a larger variety of fish and more desserts (perhaps cheesecake or offering something similar to Goyemon's dessert menu). That's nitpicking though because everything here tastes fresh and delicious. The yellowtail here is among if not the best one for Vegas AYCE. Prices here are about the same for dinner but the speed, accuracy and friendly service sets Jjanga high above other similar restaurants. Definitely recommend",

That was a straight out lie! I could see them at a table and furthermore there were still 4 empty seats at the bar! After an hour we were seated, I asked for some edemame to be brought immediately since my girl was becoming nausea's, waitress said sure I'll get it right away, she came back 3X since that and 20 min later she finally brought it with the regular order.  My cousin waited 20 min for teriyaki appetizer and never did get two miso soups, so his girlfriend had his.  Service and wait times were lousy!!

No for the nigiri nice slices of fish and not to much rice good fishbowl rice ratio. And just like the nigiri their Maki is very well done they don't fall apart and it isn't packed with rice like allot of other ayce places they want you to enjoy the rolls not just get you full so you leave.  Their a assortment is quite large and they have no qualms making slight adjustments to their rolls, I don't mean go over board but I came with my pregnant wife and ordered every cooked roll the had and they would omit stuff for us linking back to their friendly service.

I made a reservation for 11 people and as soon as we walked in we were seated right away, not all of our party came in at the same time but we were still seated. Some places u have to wait until your party arrives. Food came to our table so quick! They were all very attentive, empty plates were taken as soon as it's cleared, they asked if there's anything we would like to order. This is WONDERFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE. Very impressed! Scott remembered us from our previous visit and that's very rare. Price is very reasonable. By far the best AYCE Sushi in town! And I'm very impressed with decor, atmosphere, and they played good upbeat music! Very modern!",

Now, it's remodeled with a cold, uninviting open floorplan and the music sucked. The food was fairly good both times, but we much thoroughly enjoyed our first visit and not at all the second.    We'll try other places before coming back but most likely won't return. It was the decor and music that made this place unique.   Now, it's just another cookie cutter restaurant theme with food you can get at any other comparable place.",

I arrived to Las Vegas around 11pm on a Wednesday night, so my GF and I were hungry after a 4 hour drive from LA. We were craving sushi, so we were amazed to see an all you can eat sushi restaurant was open till 2am. Surprisingly, there was a good amount of people at the restaurant. The waiter had a thick accent but we were able to communicate. We had the AYCE, so we started with some hand rolls and a few California rolls. We then noticed they had a monkey burrito! At first I was hesitant to try it, but I ended up trying it anyways. It was actually really good. It's served in a plate and looks like a wrap. It contains crab, shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, avocado with spicy mayo and eel sauce. That would have to be my favorite item in the menu.   Overall, this restaurant was very good. Back home, we don't have any sushi spots that are open till 2am, so that's a big plus. I noticed the shopping center was a bit sketchy, but the food was good, so it was worth it.",

    "text": "I gave away our card with 4 stamps at the end of the meal.  THAT'S how sure our group was that none of us would ever return.    This isn't sushi in the Japanese sense.  These are crazy freakin rolls/inventions that contain some raw fish in, on or around them.  Calling this Japanese is very misleading.  The typical roll on the menu sounds like this:  \"Tastes and smells like your bitchy ex-mother in law's 1st semester college sophomore roommate who did the whole lacrosse team on a dare and got Hepatitis C roll:  Baked inside out roll stuffed with eel, cream cheese, bbq sauce, avocado, super super super white tuna, chopped yellowtail and spicy tuna, shishito peppers, scallop, garlic and salmon on top with orgasm, yum yum, and fuck me in the ass sauce on the side.\"  As you can see, they used the whole \"I Love Sushi\" concept and took it way over the top.  This could be a potentially fun dinner (as many Yelp reviews can attest) trying all the insanity but there were enough misses to warrant my negativity.  It wasn't fun, but it sure was funny.    - Sushi rice was off.  Slimy?  Low quality?  I don't know for sure since there was a lot of sauce.  I see a lot of reviews raving about sashimi though.    -Speaking of sauce...what's up with drenching sauce all over nigiri?  Several pieces of nigiri came with sauce on top as a default.  We actually had to request it without.  Freshness of the fish was ok.  None of us died afterwards.    -Pretty sure that was shrimp cocktail drenched in a soy sauce base and topped with scallion advertised as amaebi.   -1 order of green tea was not green but it might have been due to the lipstick contamination on the side of the cup.  The liquid was a very, very light brown.  The server claimed it was green tea despite my protest.  Magically, the next cup of tea was suddenly very green.  So that's where Dirk Arthur has been performing all this time!!  - I didn't know uni came in so many colors.  The most suspect pieces were left on the plate.  The server didn't even question it.  She just took them away like she knew.  - My native Japanese dinnermates found the tamago presentation to be hilarious.  A tamago house!  At least the unagi was good.  Congratulations on well cooked eel!  Have a good life.",

    "text": "After seeing so many people go to this place and mention how good it is, decided to go try it out with my family.  Korean owned japanese restaurant, located in an EH area of town. Not the nicest area lol...   Decor, gotta give it to them. Overall i think it looks pretty nice. Lots of wooden fencing accents and along the walls.   AYCE (All-you-can-eat) sushi is $20.95 for lunch (1130A - 300P) and $25.95 for dinner (300P - 200A). Also mentions about having an \"ordering time limited to 45 minutes for lunch, and 1 hour for dinner. dining time is not limited\". This doesn't really make sense to me but its never really enforced anyway.   As always, order a sample of nigiri to test, and order more if good ! so this is what i ordered XD (not at the same time, over course of dinner)   A mention of the rice. I'm not the pickiest but im not the kind of person that will say everything and anything is good. I do have a favorite place in terms for rice used in sushi. Rice is a compliment to the fish that it is paired with. Both have to be good in quality for a good experience. One can not be good without the other.   This rice. Not much flavored. Breaks apart. Mushy. If i had to rate just the rice? 1 out of 5.   Tuna (Maguro) - dark red. mushy. little to no flavor. doesn't seem really fresh either. cant sense any metallic taste to the fish either   Yellowtail (Hamachi) - nice pinkish color. sweet.   Red Snapper (Izumidai) - nice color. good texture.   Halibut (Hirame) - not really fresh. no \"bite\"   Salmon (sake) - probably one of the better items of the nigiri list. tastes fatty and fresh. too bad rice was bad. otherwise would have been good.   Smoked Salmon - the most awkward one (ordered by cousin). not like any of the usual smoked salmon i've had before. Thick slice. slightly lighter and firmer than a normal salmon piece. you can smell the smoked aroma fairly quickly. taste was a bit salty but expected for a smoked salmon.   Fresh Water Eel (Unagi) - not bad. the eel was a little cold. not sure if it's because of sitting on table or what. eel texture was mid mushy mid firm. sauce was normal. sweet.   Salmon Egg (Ikura) - \"fishy popping boba\" as what my cousin called it. had its usual salty flavor but may not be fresh either. had a \"fishy\" taste.   Egg (Tamago) - surprisingly, this was nicely made. Thick cut piece. presentation was a bit non-traditional. imagine the size of a fish nigiri cut. folded in half. and cut mid way to make a pyramid over a small ball of rice. not only did it not hold the rice, it was a bit weird (presentation wise). taste wise, it was good. nice and sweet.   Sweet Shrimp (Amaebi) - Not really sweet. Small shrimp as well. Not exactly sure if its even real amaebi. A tip had mentioned it is not real amaebi. more like regular shrimp marinated in a sweet sauce.   Beef Tataki - worst one of all. Not saying the way it is done is bad. but the quality of the beef was bad. almost all the beef had a fairly big chewy piece that made it seem like you just ate a piece of beef chewing gum. beef wasnt seasoned either. so quite plain in taste overall.   Kake Udon - small bowl of udon in a kake (light broth made with laver, bonito flakes, soy sauce). udon was cooked pretty good. still a good \"bite\". not overcooked. Good way to stuff yourself cuz there wasnt much other items that caught my attention   Appetizers !   Baked Green Mussel - not sure what sauce they used. some sweet sauce mixed with the japanese mayo.... mussel was warm at best. mussel was in whole pieces. not cut in half.   Shrimp Tempura - also one of the better items of the meal. nicely breaded and fried. nice light golden color. crispy and hot.   Golden Scallop - deep fried to a light brown color. overcooked (for my preference) in terms of scallop. even the center was fully cooked. at least its a real scallop.   Grilled Mackerel (Rec' by Michael K) - overgrilled. meat was a bit dry. as expected from mackerel, lots of small bones. not skilled to eat it fast XD   Salmon Skin Handroll w/ Fresh Salmon (Rec' by Michael K) - also one of the better items of the meal. Fairly stuffed hand roll with crispy fried salmon skin, but also cuts of fresh salmon pieces as well. Good recommendation !   Spider (soft shell crab, crab, avocado, cucumber, gobo w/ eel sauce) - Soft shell crab was a bit cold. Not sure if the crab was fried before hand or what not. Didn't notice the gobo in the roll.   Burning Your Ass (spicy soft shell crab, tuna, cucumber, crab, spicy tuna, spicy kiss sauce, mustard sauce, jalapeno, sriracha on top) - to be honest, i did NOT notice there was soft shell crab in this. yeah there was sriracha and jalepeno on it. and spicy tuna, but eh... its no where near burning MY ass XD   Overall experience, eh. Service was good. Tea is $1. Food was not up to what people have said. Most likely won't come back again.",

LOL back then it used to be owned by Geisha House and now it has been taken over by JJanga and his cousin! We've been here twice now and most everything has been delicious,, some fish fresher than others but the 2 standouts for me are the ama ebi & the yuzu yellowtail... mmmmM! In addition to nigiri they have lots of rolls, rice-less rolls and appetizers.. Service is hit or miss... Some of the servers are awesome and some (mostly the females) get super stressed out when it's busy but I can understand that! Even on a busy night the food comes out at a good pace...I've never had to wait for a table and they are like a dollar cheaper than Goyemon ;) plus they also have karaoke rooms here!

    "text": "If you come in not really hungry and you end up eating a lot more than you wanted to then the place has to be good, that's exactly what happened to me.  Let's just skip straight to the food. Going from what I took a picture first:   Salmon Skin Handroll and Something Wrong #69 Roll - <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jjanga-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?select=GB-a9JAvq6PMaqA4MylUbA#GB-a9JAvq6PMaqA4MylUbA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/jjan...</a>  Ever since Blue Fin Sushi turned me into a Salmon Skin Handrolls junkie I gotta have it every time I do AYCE sushi, if it's offered. It wasn't that bad; it was missing the crunchiness, but did the spot. The Something Wrong #69 was probably one of my favorite rolls. It's a shrimp tempura roll, which I usually a fan of, topped with spicy soft shell crab, tuna, salmon, white fish, and a spicy garlic ponzu. I devoured everything in that picture on my own. Sorry for not that great of a pic but the real stuff looked and tasted delicious.  Oysters - <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jjanga-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?select=GB-a9JAvq6PMaqA4MylUbA#2sMNzctANegqVqvPkGG0lQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/jjan...</a>  It was one of the items you could only order one of.  Honestly I love oysters but because I was only limited to 2 I don't think I had enough to like it too much. I inhaled them and don't remember the flavors.  Who's Your Ex-wife and Shrimp Tempura -  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jjanga-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?select=GB-a9JAvq6PMaqA4MylUbA#wyCtws-hZWHCkw_c3C1EUw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/jjan...</a>  Now the Who's Your Ex-wife is my kind of eats. I don't remember what exactly it was but I think it was a stuffed fried jalapeno with fish. I kind of wished I went back for seconds so I could've remember more but I liked it a lot cause it was spicy and delicious. The Shrimp Tempura was not bad just know that 1 order is just 2 pieces not your usual handful else where.  Spicy Garlic Edamame - <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jjanga-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?select=GB-a9JAvq6PMaqA4MylUbA#cwzi6JqmNpr2L7IMg3KDlw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/jjan...</a> No one usually make um like this but I enjoyed them, though I didn't fill myself up on them because I was eating sushi. I'd order um.  Now for the other items:  Screaming O Sashimi - Why not!? I'm always a fan of the sauce as long as it's not too sweet. It was made right to my liking.  Nigiri - Not a great selection but I liked the garlic tuna, hamachi, cajun albacore, and sweet shrimp. Didn't care for the tamago or uni. A lot of the pieces were smaller than I'm use to but it's AYCE so ordering more is fine.  Apps - I liked the Golden Scallops and whatever I already mentioned. I ordered and really wanted the baked green mussels, agedashi tofu, and calamari rings but never got them.  Rolls - Well there's too many I liked so I'll say that there's an awesome selection of spicy, baked, deep fried, and shrimp tempura rolls. Should there ever be anything else!? Some honorable mentions Burning Your Ass roll, Fat Ass roll, Taste Like My X Girlfriend roll, Stacy Mom roll, Sexy Time roll, never mind I just started being immature.   For those try to cut back on rice there are a few no rice rolls.  The customer service was very friendly and brought food out in quickly but struggled keeping track of everyone's order. Jjanga is funny and loud great for kids. Anyways I'm still a fan for mostly everything so I'll be back.",

    "text": "Yama Sushi on Flamingo is usually my go-to sushi place but we decided to try something different for a change. Their rolls selection is more to my liking than other places I've been but that's the only pro I can point out. They put more rice in their nigiri than I'm used to, which I'm sure is done on purpose. The fish on their nigiri was breaking apart. I also had to ask for my seafood salad order three times. We ordered it right when we got our waters and then we had to ask for it again after 15 minutes. When they finally brought it over, they only brought one so I had to order it again, which took another 15 minutes. They lack dessert options and variety but that's expected. Their service was subpar. They were nice but kind of slow. At least my water never ran low.",

The price was right, coming it at a buck or two cheaper than Umiya that I usually go to. Our server was friendly, dealing with our rowdy bunch throughout our meal. All the food was good, but they did forget a few things along the way.  I definitely wasn't a fan of how they handled the check, which bumped them down to 3* instead of 4*. I believe it was the manager who came over and handed us the bill, and then awkwardly stood there as the 5 of us pulled out cards and cash and tried to figure out how we were divying up the bill. I get that we were there for a long time and they were effectively cutting us off, but there were more tactful ways of doing it. Not sure if our server asked the manager to handle it or he took it upon himself, but again, there are more polite ways to bring us the check and give us time to sort it out.  I'd go here again, but if I'm picking, I'll stick with Umiya.",

I can't exactly remember anything that stood out to me that said this place is UH-MAZING. It was nice that there was a bunch of variety.   Overall, service was lacking.

He is like a sushi connoisseur and loves to eat everything single thing on the menu. I, on the other hand, can only stomach a few pieces of raw fish before I tap out. JJANGA has an All-You-Can-Eat option and it doesn't have to apply to everyone at the table, which is great because my bf can pig out while I enjoy the few rolls that I love. Speaking of their rolls, they have so many and the ones that I have tasted have been deeeelicious!  This place is reallyyy good!  Very cool vibe and chill sushi chefs. Def a must try!",

    "text": "Jjanga is AYCE for $25.95 Jjanga is new and not busy Jjanga has excellent service Jjanga is a good pick if you're looking for some Yum Yum Rolls.   I'm not a sushi snob, but I do prefer Sashimi's and Nigiri over rolls.  It's been forever since I've had a Yum Yum Roll.  For some reason, I was craving these California Rolls drenched in mayo. It's been awhile. It's been a very long time.  So, when the gf suggested sushi for our Valentine's Day dinner instead of our usual steak dinner, I couldn't help be get a little excited about it.    From the time we walked in to the time we left, we had nothing but excellent service.  The team at Jjanga can sure teach a few other sushi restuarants out there about customer service.  They know what's up and they knew how to treat me and my special lady.  Good Job, Jjanga!  My Items: Mells Roll:  This was my first roll of the evening. How could I not get this roll, right?  Inside was crab and shrimp.  This roll has a spectacular name, but was just okay when it came to taste.     Jjanga Burrito:  This is a hand roll with shrimp, broccoli tempura, and crab wrapped in soy paper.  This was actually pretty good and great light option if you're looking for something that isn't going to weigh you down.   Jackpot Special:  Jackpot!  I think I found the king of all Yum Yum Rolls.  This one had shrimp tempura on the inside with spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, and of course a ton of mayo sauce on the outside.  If you're going to eat bad, might as well get this. I probably could have gotten two of these rolls.   Freshman Roll:  This had everything...tuna, salmon, and crab.  Wrapped in rice paper, my taste buds were a little confused on what it was tasting because there was so much going on.  But I still thought that this was good.    Teriyaki Chicken w/Brown Rice:  What was I thinking?  The brown rice wasn't the best and the chicken was a little bland even with Teriyaki sauce. My bad...I shouldn't be going to a sushi restuarant expecting great chicken.   Regarding their food, I only had 4 full rolls, their Jjanga burrito, Teriyaki chicken, and Green Tea Mochi.  Needless to say, I was stuffed.  I thought that the sushi was fresh, the rolls were tight, and all were packed with taste.  Bottomline, the food is fresh.  On my next visit, I will probably go back to Sashimi's and Nigiri's because that's what I prefer.  But from someone that doesn't frequent a Yum Yum Roll, I recommend this place. I  PS:  They got the same rolls as Sumo. So if you're a fan of Sumo, then you'll be a fan of Jjanga.  YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE - (048/366)",

Overall: The atmosphere is urban and casual. The staff is very friendly and they always make sure that you're being taken cared of (making sure they keep your drinks filled and you ACYE orders are taken and fulfilled). Jjanga has a unique All You Can Eat menu; which rangers from \"no rice sushi rolls\" to their bacon roll. One of my favorite items is their pumpkin soup; it's super creamy and delicately sweet. Their dessert menu is simple: ice cream and mochi. It's a great place for groups. My older brother had his birthday dinner in their private room and it hosted 20 or so guests.   If you're looking for a fun and new sushi joint that's not the typical and cookie cutter go to Jjanga.",

My husband and I wanted to try some different type of rolls so he got a spicy salmon crunch and he was taken back that it was actually spicy, he said most places but just a little bit of spice and it's meh but this place knocked it out of the park. I had a hard time pick between rolls be honestly they all looked and sounded amazing. For my last two half rolls I got the coco shrimp and the golden gate. Two very desserty type of rolls. The coco has coconut flakes and a sweet sauce which is honestly bomb, the golden gate had fried banana on top. Can't wait to come back thank you for an amazing date night!",

The nigiri is good and their sweet shrimp is actually big. Yum. I also liked the ocean trout and the blue fin tuna. Their cucumber salad was just cucumber with a little sauce, it could have been better I thought it was too simple and lack some seasoning/correct sauce. You all should try the bulgogi pork it comes out sizzling hot and it was yummy. I think that dish was memorable for me. Dessert was good because I liked the coconut flakes that was added on top of the ice cream. I got the green tea one. Overall decent AYCE sushi spot. My server lady was really friendly and nice.

    "text": "In Vegas with a group of friends and looking for a place to get some food. We have eaten on the strip plenty of times, but sometimes it takes longer to get there than leaving the strip. Also we figured a buffet would make it easy for a big group since the bill would be divided equally at the end without much time or complication. So basically we came here because of the convenience.   However, Sushi Ya exceeded all our expectations. The quality of the food and the service were top notch. Everything we had was delicious. The highlights were the poke salad, carpaccio, the sweet shrimp nigiri, all the specialty sushi, and even the ice cream. They were so fast at bringing out the food, clearing the empty plates, and coming back to take more of our orders.   Everyone was so happy and full. The price for what you get is a huge steal! I think it is around $26 for everything off the menu! Seriously, we will definitely be coming back here every time we are in Vegas.",

    "text": "On a night when Goyemon didn't offer their salmon belly special, we ended up trying Jjanga. The nice thing was that there was no wait for dinner. The limit for the AYCE was 1 hour, but I don't know how strictly that was enforced. Dinner was $25.95, which is comparable to most AYCE sushi joints.  Some of the highlights of the menu include the sashimi (choice of one item per person), hamachi kama, bulgogi, tobiko, sweet shrimp, oyster, and uni. Despite the lack of salmon belly here, the regular salmon nigiri was perfect as well as the version with the apple mayo sauce. I also really enjoyed the yuzu yellowtail. We skilled most of the rolls, but did try the hand's job. As one might expect, it was drenched in \"yum yum\" cream sauce and quite messy.  I was pleasantly surprised by how great all the nigiri was. The dessert included a delicious coconut flake ice cream, with flavors including green tea, which was quite creamy. The downsides of this AYCE menu are the lack of any specials, a much smaller nigiri menu, and less variety with the desserts. On top of that, our waitress denied us ordering more than one dessert even though the menu does not state a limit.",

Among lots of the great sushi options, they make really excellent green mussels!  Yum! I have had green mussels that came out sub par at other places before, but here they are perfect every time!  My husband and I both highly recommend this place! 5 stars for food and service!   Side note: I was reading other reviews and someone complained about how big their sushi rolls are.  Just for the record, it is possible to order just half a roll if you and the person you came with dont like the same types of sushi.",

They also have the option of doing all you can drink sake/Sapporo for an additional $10 per person.   For our apps, we tried the baby octopus (crispy and juicy with a drizzle of what might've been teriyaki sauce), agedashi tofu (can't go wrong with this at any sushi restaurant), mini udon, and mixed tempura.  As for the nigiri, they are pretty generous with the fish portion and it tasted fresh. The special for the day was ocean water trout, which I'd recommend everyone to try; it looks like salmon, but has that nice taste of yellowtail, maybe even better.   As for the special rolls, we tried the Gangnam roll and \"Bunny and Bonny\". Both items were off the spicy list, but Gangnam roll was definitely spicier with the slices of jalapeno buried in each roll and sitting in a spicy sauce. The Bunny and Bonny wasn't as spicy, it had crispy carrot strings on the top and the rolls were wrapped with soy paper.  For dessert we had the Melon ice cream bar and a cup of green tea ice cream with crispy shredded coconut.   We paired our food with a nice cold pitcher of Sapporo for only $15, and our server refilled our pitcher again after our first round at no charge (maybe because we were the last table there), but thank you to her!   This location used to be Jjanga. I'd definitely be a returning customer!",

    "text": "This JJANGA location has a cool rustic interior. The space is cozy but nice. If you haven't taken cue from the name, this place is Korean. Which is why you'll see Korean fare like bulgogi on their list of side dishes. Daebak!   Went here for AYCE and tried their yummy beef steak side dish and the grilled pike mackerel. I don't usually bother with a lot of side dishes when getting AYCE sushi but I couldn't resist and they were worth it. On the other hand, the nigiri sushi could've had better fish to rice ratio. I thought the fish seemed pretty tasty after you get past all the rice but I had serious doubts about the uni quality. The uni I'm used to is golden and sweet. The uni I had at JJANGA was kinda gray and on the bitter side.   This place probably kills it with their rolls but I prefer nigiri and avoid the sauce and rice-laden dishes. They also charged for iced green tea. Tea is usually free in the better sushi places I've visited.",

We literally had to flag down someone to order more food. Servers were gone for ten minutes at a time - nowhere to be seen. A third of our order completely disappeared with no apology whatsoever. It was so frustrating. The food was delicious as always, such a shame that we were ignored. Hope this was just bad luck because the food is awesome for AYCE.",

Tell me why we're not getting our food... yet we're getting food we did NOT order? Lucky them. At least someone in this restaurant is being served. =] 6. Jjanga? More like JJUMANJI- it's a MESS up in here. 7. No alcohol because they're renewing their liquor license. I need sake to deal with this service.  8. Someone just came by while writing this review- \"you guys order all this?\" ... clearly not because it's not ours. 9. TELL ME WHY I FINALLY GOT MY OYSTERS AND THERE'S ONLY ONE?! 90. minutes. ONE. Oyster. My bad- the menu said oyster, not plural.  10. Clearly short staffed. The bathroom is a natural disaster. 11. They just came by and asked us how our ice cream was. Wut? WHAT ICE CREAM?! 12. LAST BUT NOT LEAST- No Pokemon around here. What's the point? 13. \"Boy bye. I ain't sorry.\"  I will never ever come back to this establishment. Over my dead body.

    "text": "Went here yesterday to get our sushi fix after a nice day of hiking icebox canyon.  Our party of 6 was famished and was quickly seated for lunch.  It wasn't very busy as it was a weekday and we were having a late lunch.  \"The sooner I can sit down, the sooner I can get started on stuffing my face!\" is what I say.  I know it's difficult to have a large party go for AYCE, but when the staff forgets about what you ordered and constantly have to be reminded of it, you know there's some organization issues in the back.  There were a couple of dishes that didn't even make it to the table before our check did.  Regardless, it was a good start, but the staff couldn't handle our giant appetites towards the end.  Some notable dishes we had involved fresh fish and good flavor combinations.  Their maguro (red tuna) was excellent that day!  I'm normally a fan of salmon, but the nigiri to order was the maguro.  The redder, the better!  I also really enjoyed their Spider Roll (a classic) and their Double D Roll.  The Double D Roll was listed under their shrimp tempura special rolls and had great intermingling of flavors along with a little kick at the end.  It was one of our favorites!  Another plus was that they do not pack on the rice!  Now on to the not-so-great dishes.  The shiro maguro (albacore) that we ordered came seared when we were under the impression that it would have been raw.  Upon eating it, you could definitely taste a distinct fishiness, which shouldn't be the case if it were fresh.  They also topped it with what tasted like the garlic sauce they usually put on top of garlic tuna.  Since this was my first time here, I wasn't sure if this was their norm to sear the shiro maguro.  I honestly think this fish was on its way to going bad, so they needed to serve it but mask the extra fishy flavor.  Another one that wasn't so appetizing was their super white tuna, which isn't listed on their menu but somehow had it when we asked for it.  It was a little disappointing because the freshness wasn't there.  There were a couple of other nigiri that just didn't cut it to my expectation of freshness, but these two were the most distinct.  I would like to see this business succeed because the ambiance, decor and cleanliness of the restaurant is excellent.  The staff really has potential to excel!  Our server was very accommodating and attentive, but unfortunately the lunch staff in the back couldn't accommodate our large orders. I probably won't be back unless they make some changes to their organization and quality.  P.S. If you're in a bind for choosing your dessert, get the green tea mochi.  It appears to me that it is homemade and you really taste the yummy green tea flavor!  You won't regret it!",

Waiting for food kills the excitement so the fast service was a major plus for me. Servers came back every now and then to ask us if we wanted to order more, which was great!!  AYCE menu has a wide variety of foods! From sushi to bulgogi to salad. I only ordered sushi - it was pretty fresh, but the rice ball was pretty big for an AYCE sushi. But I was most excited about AYCE uni sushi. i LOVE LOVE LOVE uni. Unfortunately, the uni here was disgusting. It was dry, chewy, and dark brown. The flavor was really fishy, slightly sour, and very bitter. We told the server the issue and asked for a replacement order and they gave me another sushi with the dry chewy dark brown uni. I was really disappointed and asked if i can get a fresh one that's not dry and nasty.... and he brushed it off and said \"all uni is from the same box\". But if you know that box of uni is bad, WHY ARE YOU STILL SERVING IT?? After getting bad uni for the third time, I gave up.   I was really disappointed with this place. I don't think I would come back. Definitely wouldn't recommend thids place to uni lovers.",

The yuzu yellowtail was the best nigiri option when we went. I liked the crispy rice and spicy tuna from the rolls. Lots of rolls to choose from and you can also get brown rice sushi for $1 extra charge. Staff is quite friendly at this Korean owned place.",

They have a wide variety or roll combos to choose from but not that many were fresh, heathy or spicy options. They have a lot of baked and fried rolls. Which were good but again mushy. Many of the rolls fell apart and you couldn't pick them up. We even sent one roll back because the salmon was \"soggy.\" Our appetizers came out last, the service was slow and not that friendly. The best part was the kids meal. My daughter loved it. Very kid friendly. The edamame and mussels are delicious! Also, they didn't renew their liquor license so no saki or beer.",

    "text": "Jjanga is a fantastic discovery. Wonderful food and more importantly, excellent service. For comparison, my father and I were in the mood for sushi, so we made a reservation at Jjanga in Chinatown, and a certain pan-Asian bistro, at a Forbes Five Star property, on Las Vegas Boulevard. Both reservations were made online and both noted my father's nut allergy. The following morning, Jjanga sent us a personal email, thanking us for the reservation, expressing their pleasure in our choosing to dine with them, and what items on the menu contained nuts. I replied to this email, a short thank you of sorts, and even received a personal confirmation for this. The restaurant on the Forbes Five Star property made no such connection, genuine sense of interest, or anticipatory service. At that point, we completely cancelled our reservation with the bistro on Las Vegas Boulevard and committed to Jjanga. Once your inside, such attentive service continues. Our waitress essentially greeted us at our table, immediately took our drink orders, and visited us several times. We were not a special party though, we could see her and the rest of the wait staff constantly running about the venue, never once stopping.   Regarding the cuisine, some may say that the sushi menu lacks diversity. I guess that is True in regards to the specific kinds of fish served, but the combinations and pairings of ingredients create a hearty and fruitful selection. Jjanga even seems to acknowledge this limitation, for it does not offer specifically sashimi options on the menu, instead dedicating space to rolls, non-rice rolls, and unique creations. A True mark of culinary skill is working around a boundary with apparent ease. Before reading the other reviews, I had forgotten the lack of strictly sashimi options. Who cares? For a traditional Japanese sushi joint in - let's remember - the God damn desert, my palate was excellently entertained.  As my father said in regards to the atmosphere, Jjanga \"lacks pretension.\" Jjanga is dedicated to the food and service, without being too serious for sushi novices and out-of-state visitors. Everyone is welcome and appreciated, and the decor reflects that in a playful yet tasteful following of Vegas's themed design, which offers several seating options that can feel more private and intimate. It says, \"We know you're here to have fun, so here's something just a taste kitsch, but properly cozy too.\"  Jjanga is a place for locals as well as vistors, so casual attire is most appropriate. That said, if you're travelling from the Boulevard, to taste something authentic and a little warmer, maybe show the respect to put on a jacket and some nice shoes like you would have at a comparable place at a hotel-casino. Jjanga maybe be more casual than some of those options, but it's still a class act that can compete with any Boulevard venue.",

For some reason the waitresses felt that it was ok to squeeze in between my husband and I to get their rolls. I'm not just saying a few times they reached in between us at least 15 times. Then standing right behind us the manager was screaming a conversation to the sushi chefs. Then to top it off not once were we asked by the waitresses if we wanted to order anything off the menu. I couldn't take the reaching in between us so I asked for a table figuring the service would be better and the manager told us we couldn't have one of the three tables open even though they only had one group of people waiting. I couldn't believe how poorly the manager handled everything. Young...couldn't get the rest of his name should be fired as a manager.",

    "text": "I used to like Jjanga a lot better and not saying the quality has gone that far downhill but I think I finally come to a realization that quality should surpass quantity, especially sushi... .  For AYCE place, Jjanga is pretty good I guess.  Most AYCE are run by Koreans, no exception here, not like I have  a problem with it.  The fish/rice ratio is great, some places definitely pack lots of rice on you, but Jjanga is pretty good on smaller nigiri with decent size fish and little rice.    Service is always great.  Everyone's happy to help and always come check on you.  All the sushi chefs, Jjanga, koo koo, choo chop, Ricky.. all friendly and try to be buddy buddy with you when you sit at the bar.  Not the cleanest place, the table/bar often feel greasy.  They do wipe down after each use of course, but don't wipe down enough or just same greasy towel over and over again, especially the edge of the table where your elbow touches... ok enough of that.  It's only $22 lunch and $26 dinner for sushi, what do you expect.  Food:  for the most part, sushi taste ok.  Your typical pre frozen, thaw out pieces of fish from typical AYCE places.  The thing I have a problem with is how all the fishes are laying right next to each other, which you'd notice in not AYCE sushi restaurants, that's a NO NO.  Each type of fish should have their own space, not necessary cross contamination on fishes but it's just not right.  And the bad part is that they service seared beef as nigiri and on some rolls too.  When the whole loin of seared beef sits right on top of a filet of salmon sashimi, that's JUST WRONG.  I was very tempting to take a picture of it and send it to the health department.  You don't mix poultry with fish, especially they are both raw!  Beef right on top of fish, and you serve that?  How are you kidding me.  And it's not just a one time mishap accident type, It's often that.  All the different type of fish are laying next to or on top of each other, along with beef, come on?  Even though i didn't get food poisoning after dining there, it sure leaves a bad taste in my mouth and in my mind.    And oyster lovers.. if you think they freshly crack open fresh oysters to serve you, then you are SO WRONG.  They recycle the oyster shell (they have a bucket for that) and they use pre packaging oysters (no shell on, like the ones you see in a glass jar at your grocery store) from a box to fill the oyster shells and put garnish on it.  Definitely NOT fresh and frankly so gross.   If you sit at the bar next time, you can watch they make it.  How clean can those oyster shells be, especially they've been recycled from other patrons, do they clean and wipe each shell good before they put another oyster meat on top?  Think twice before you order it next time.  When I went the first time, I had no idea, ordered it, tasted gross, then saw how they make it.. go figure.  Jjanga is probably still my go to place for AYCE when I feel really cheap and have a moment weakness of spending less on sushi. But honestly, I wouldn't want to go often as knowing how much germ I've consumed by trying to be cheap....",

As soon as i walked in the manager already notified me that they just got a big party seated and are falling behind, but of course I will get my food, it will just take longer. I had no problem. I was seated right away and the food came out faster than other sushi places i had been to. The staff are very nice and loud just like you would expect at any sushi restaurant. Sushi is fantastic, and they are open late which is great.",

    "text": "We took a visiting family member out tonight and opted for AYCE sushi which landed us an Jjanga. We opted for the AYCE dinner, which was $25.95 per person. There was also a happy hour option that was a few bucks cheaper, but excluded most of the specialty items. For me, when it comes to sushi it's all about the rice. Call me picky, but when rice isn't the right amount of sticky and falling out of my rolls...well, it kinda drives me crazy. This wasn't the case here, so that was definitely a plus. We ordered a few rolls to start out, and none of them were special. I won't even begin to talk about their names. All in all, they were all just bland, even though they were drenched in sauce.   We figured some saki and beer could make things more enjoyable, and while looking around for our server noticed a sign in the center of the restaurant stating that alcohol was not being served. That was a huge disappointment because we were unaware, uninformed, and at that point it was already too late to leave. We attempted to question our server about it, but she just brushed it off, and so did we. At that point, we really had no choice. Moving along, we decided to make the best of it and ordered a variety of other items. Our favorites being the tofu, garlic edamame, crab balls, and golden scallops. Everything else was again, just okay.   Not long after we requested our check, and requested ice cream and mochi for our desert as we waited. The check came in 2 seconds, and fifteen minutes later there was still no ice cream. So, we flagged a server down and told her not to worry about our desert, and got up to leave. Overall, this was not the best AYCE experience we have had, but it also wasn't the worst. We were hoping for a more enjoyable, alcoholic version of AYCE sushi dinner for our guest and unfortunately things just didn't work in our favor. Perhaps better luck next time...well, if we ever decide to make the drive across town again and give it a go.",

    "text": "I don't usually go to AYCE sushi restaurants because of the stigma of low quality.  I always get the feeling that quality is diminished when the restaurant is just churning out sushi for all of their hungry customers.  So I came to JJanga wanting to try the food, but not for the AYCE deal.    I ended up ordering a la carte, which actually offers some solid prices at $3 for appetizers (small portions but wide variety and tasty), $3 normal sushi (california, tuna, etc.), $5 rolls/burritos, and then $8 for specialties.  AYCE was $25 so considering I stuck with a few minor rolls and appetizers it wouldn't have made sense anyways.  I got the mushroom ball and agedashi tofu appetizers to begin, and then the spicy tuna roll, yummy vegetarian roll, and Jjanga burrito.  The appetizers were of high quality but for $3 were very small.  The spicy tuna came with 8 pieces, so although it wasn't the best roll I've ever eaten, and not the cleanest prepared, the price was too cheap to say anything negative.  It was solid. The vegetarian Yummy roll was very good.  Tempura and a nice spicy sauce for a good kick.  The burrito was an interesting concept but nothing to shout about.  I do have some comments about the restaurant.  To start, wasabi was a $1 extra charge.  This is a sushi restaurant so that was very weird, although they brought out like a full ice cream scoop when ordered so that makes up for the surcharge.  They also have no liquor license, yet advertise sake and beer both in their menu and on their wall in the restaurant.  Next, the waitstaff had no idea what they were doing and we had 3 different waiters take our order so we never really had that server experience or have a personalized waiter to request stuff from.  And finally they messed up our receipt.  The price was the same as what we ordered so we didn't bother complaining, but they replaced two different sushi items on the receipt that we did not order.  So either they ned to update their cashier system or take better order noted to cite the price correctly.    I'm not a fan of AYCE, as I said, so I probably won't be back.  But they have a huge variety of sushi (albeit most consist of the same crab, tuna, avocado, etc. ingredients) so if AYCE is your thing, then $25 isn't horrible and the quality is fine for the experience.",

    "text": "I hate that I have to live two states away in Colorado, knowing that amazing sushi is so far away.  I think about JJANGA almost weekly when I crave sushi and realize that the stuff around here just doesn't cut it.  We went to JJANGA at the tail end of our wedding weekend, hours before our return flight home.  We wanted something off-strip, affordable and AYCE.  We wanted to be able to drive there, park without a valet, and then return our rental car in time.  Yelp led us to JJANGA and I can't wait to go back.  I love the vibe of the restaurant.  It's heavy in dark woods with booths that sort of resemble pagodas.  There's a nice long sushi bar tucked in the back.  The sushi bar was popular but we were lucky to score two seats right in the middle of the sushi-making action.  I can't remember everything we tried but the rolls were innovative and plentiful.  The sushi chef handed us small bites and tastes along the way.  I think JJANGA's special hook is their \"burritos,\" which are small bundles of fish or rice noodles and fish or other fixings wrapped in soy paper.  We ordered one that was wrapped in pink soy paper and drizzled with a pink sauce.    Fish was premium and veggies were fresh.  I didn't feel like I was eating AYCE.  Most AYCE sushi restaurants shove you full of rice, mostly, and make you want to calculate the price of each roll so you can ensure you've gotten your $30 worth of food.  This sushi restaurant makes you want to take a minute to appreciate the cuts of fish and their garnishes.    I'm not sure how long JJANGA has been open but I hope they don't make too many changes to their menu, philosophy or prices before we can get back to Las Vegas.  I know it will be near the top of our list of restaurants to visit the next time we have a weekend getaway.",

The wooden walls and cute couches were a nice touch. The decor made me feel like I wasn't in Vegas anymore.   Before I get into the food. I highly highly highly recommend everyone get the grapefruit sake ($10 for the large). It is the best thing I've ever had in my life! Our server, Scott (might've been the manager), recommended it. He even took a shot with us. After I told him we were there for my birthday, he brought out another large grapefruit sake.. On the house! Thank You Scott!!   The items that really made me want to try this place were the \"riceless\" rolls and the burritos. Started with the Johnny Riceless roll! Oh my goodness it was so delicious. Then the Monkey burrito came out and I almost died and went to sushi heaven. Besides the Grapefruit Sake, that's another \"you must try\".  Everything else was really good. I honestly can't go through all the different rolls we ordered. There were to many. & to be quite honest it was all a blur, once the food came out I didn't think about anything but how I'm  going to fit everything in my belly. What is pictured isn't even half of what we had ordered.   This place is very kid friendly. They even have a \"treasure chest\" in the front for the little kids to choose a toy. Probably was put there to shut the crying kids up so the adults can eat.  \\_()_/    There are Karaoke private rooms that you can go in for $20. We peaked inside and it's pretty darn cool. We can UYE in there! Rent all the rooms out! who's with me?! Lol",

The nigiri was super fresh and it didn't have that very slimy texture like other sushi AYCE places.   I was quite pleased with the other rolls and the house salad was on point. When I go to sushi/japanese places... I tend to judge on their House Salad..  LET ME TELL YOU... it was on point.   If you are in Vegas craving for some AYCE sushi... COME HERE. So worth the wait.",

Was it because there was 2 big Hawaiian and you counted us as 1 1/2 each?  Or was you hoping for us not to see that charge on the bill  and tip you on top of that?

    "text": "Another AYCE joint to be added to the list! A+ all around! Was very impressed with the service, food and kid-friendly environment!  Dinner AYCE price - $25.95, pretty normal compared to other places.  Menu includes tons of items from nigiri, soup and salads, appetizers, special handrolls, spicy rolls, no rice rolls, baked rolls, fried rolls, and shrimp tempura rolls!  Loved that they don't believe in smothering everything in the rice.. Or sauce..  Fiance had tons of their nigiri from the looks of it, the rice to fish ratio was good --not too much rice! I started off with the salmon skin handroll, had chunks of the actual salmon meat with the crispy skin! My fave at any sushi restaurant!  Then proceeded with a couple rolls : * Riceless Fresh Men Roll - had tuna, crab, shrimp and avocado wrapped in rice paper, side of the ginger, mustard sauce. It was a bit too gingery for me, regardless it was still a good, fresh roll. * Monkey Burrito Roll - this was SOO good! An actual sushi burrito with shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, and crab wrapped in soy paper came with spicy mayo on the side, decent size, and wasn't too filling! * Something Wrong #69 - shrimp tempura, soft shell crab, tuna and salmon with their spicy garlic ponzu! I love anything garlic ponzu! This roll was not that spicy, just had a lil kick to it!  * Brown Rice Mountain Roll - my least favorite roll only because there was nothing mind blowing about it -- cream cheese, avocado and salmon all baked together. The brown rice was overcooked, in my opinion.  And I couldn't handle the cheesiness of the roll.  We also had a couple appetizers or sides :  Chicken Wings - really good (I mean you really can't mess this up)! Not too much breading just like how my son likes it! Fries - natural cut, real potatoes! Bulgogi - delicious grilled, marinated beef!   Service was quick! There were too much bodies, making it a bit confusing on who's waiter is who's. But waters were always filled, dishes were taken as soon as they were empty, and food came out within minutes!  Can't reiterate enough how much I love that they're kid friendly! They even have a treasure chest filled with toys for the kids to take before they leave! So awesome!   Must try and definitely recommended to families and everyone else!   FYI! They do karaoke next door, $20 an hour for a room, one room fitting about 6 people!",

Maybe it was because they were busy? & there were only like 2-3 servers but I just don't think poor service is excusable. We had to ask if we could order, ask for water, & just keep asking if we needed something. When we did ask for stuff, the servers acted so annoyed??? I was very confused cos they are usually so nice. We were not asked, not even once, how everything was or if we needed anything. If I didn't place my card & my stamp card at the edge of the table, they probably wouldn't have gotten the hint that we wanted our check. I'm hoping this doesn't become a norm because I really do love this place.   Other than the subpar customer service, the food was really good. Order a spicy yellowtail hand roll with spicy mayo on the side!! Super delicious.",

I'm still amazed of how nice the restrooms were. The restrooms even had mouth wash and dental picks! Nice touch indeed!  There is usually plenty of parking and although I have come and it has been super busy, I have not had to wait super long to get seated.  Really affordable pricing! AYCE lunch for $13.99 almost seems too low though! Can't complain. It keeps me and my crew coming back.  This place would be even more amazing if they stayed open later! Since it is located by Cafe Moda and other late night club/bar spots I'm sure they would get a good (although drunk) crowd coming in for some late night sushi!",

    "text": "If I could give this place no star I would!  Won't be coming back here ever again.  This review is for their AYCE.  I went in around 6pm on Monday evening, our server allowed us to choose our table since it was very empty and only 2 other tables were occupied.  Things started off well we got our drinks and looked over the menu to decide whether we wanted to do AYCE or the Ala carte menu since the rolls were $10.99-13.99 a roll, we decided to go with the AYCE dinner price $25.95 since we for sure were ordering more then 2 rolls.  We started off by getting some Edamame, Fried Rice and Fried Calamari. My boyfriend is vegan so we had to order different rolls and couldn't really share and I'm Allergic to Avocado so I really had to be careful.   I'm a huge fan of Fried and baked Rolls that's all I ordered. They're \"Fried Rolls\" just tasted soggy. Nothing really seemed Fried about them.  Food took just a few minutes to arrive after ordering. Food wasn't to appetizing, nothing really popped out. It tasted rushed or as if the chef really wasn't a \"True\" sushi chef.  The talent was just not there, but I still ate it.    I finished my first two rolls, and decided I'd go for a third one. Towards the end I got really full, I sat for a bit looking  at my food like \"damn, I'm full and cannot take another bite or Its coming out!\"  I took another bite and that was my last, i turned to my boyfriend and said \"I'm done I can't no more.\"  Our server came over, I didn't get her name but she was an older Asian Lady. She looked at us and said \"Any dessert?\"  We looked at each other and said replied, \"no thank you, just the bill would be great.\"  She left to get our tab and when she returned she brought a cart with her ready to pick up our dishes on the table. As I'm looking over the tab, she reaches for a plate and stops. She then goes \"uhhh, wait it's more\"  I looked over at her and say \"what is?\" She then replies with \"you left food it's more\" and reaches for the bill. She walks over to the POS system and returns. With an additional charge of 9.99$ on our bill.  I've gone to so many AYCE sushi and never have I been charged for leaving 1-2 pieces of sushi. The plates are huge and it's crazy that you get charged for small portions of left overs. I suggest to have smaller plate potions for AYCE. My experience sucked, I gave this place a shot since they took over Jjanga's original spot but I should've just went to Yama Sushi. ",

    "text": "This review is for their AYCE sushi  I am not fond of this place.  The last time I came here was for dinner since all other places had a wait of an hour or more.  I came with one other person on a weekday for dinner and it was pretty pack.  We decided to sit at the bar since it was the only option with no wait.  They had two options for AYCE sushi.  For sushi it was $26 per person and for sashimi it was $36 per person.  I went with the sushi option after briefing their $36 sashimi option.    The rules are similar to other AYCE sushi places.  They allow for one order of their carpaccio per person for the sushi option.  That was probably the only thing I enjoyed there, the yellowtail and salmon carpaccio.  I also tried their uni and sweet shrimp and both were whatever.  All other items I tried I did not care for.  Their special sushi for the day was kanpanci, which I also didn't like too much.  The rolls here are HUGE.  I hate when AYCE sushi places makes such large rolls because the person I came with does not eat similar items as me.  This makes it hard to share rolls.  Also, there were only two options of rolls without rice, which I much rather prefer.    As for service, it was terrible.  And this is speaking from someone who has sat at their bar.  Not only did they kept messing up our orders and we kept having to ask multiple times for our food, but everything seemed sloppy.  For example, my miso soup bowl was super wet on the outside.  Ew.  It was hard to get even sushi chef's attention.  We probably won't come back.",

Since AYCE sushi places are so frequent in Vegas, you really have to stand out and they did a great job of doing this. I really liked that they were open until midnight since when we went to eat, it was already 10 at night. They were so fast to get our orders put in and we were in and out before 11. I am more of a nigiri person rather than rolls, so that I what I ate this time around.  The nigiri had a great fish to rice ratio. I especially loved the amaebi. It was the largest sweet shrimp I had ever seen and it was very fresh.  The waitresses were very friendly and even though it was a late, they were both eager to help us. I wasn't an AYCE hungry at the time so I only had a few orders of nigiri, but everything was delicious. The only thing I didn't like was the chili garlic edamame. It was a little too spicy for my liking, but overall a great experience.",

The specialty rolls vary, most all you can eat sushi places I've been to typically just have a California roll or spicy tuna roll with whatever they add to the top. Here they also have those as well as shrimp tempura or crab roll as the base for some of their special rolls.  They have a big selection of appetizers & sushi, they also have a choice of sashimi (1 per person) for the all you can eat option. The choice of sauce they use on their rolls & sushi really made the food taste amazing.   This is a must trying if you're looking for an AYCE sushi place in Vegas. It was about a 10 min drive from the strip to get here.",

We filled up on high quality fish/seafood, without the rice.  The sashimi AYCE price was $10 more than the sushi AYCE, but worth it to me since I don't eat rice anymore.  Can't wait to come here again.",

Came for the lunch AYCE around 1:00 PM and sat at the bar. Service was good, constantly checked on me to see if I needed anything without being intrusive and refilled my tea.  Other than that your typical Sin City AYCE Sushi spot that is decent with a healthy selection. My only criticism of this place is the white plates they use to serve food. Not a big fan of them, feels very uncouth...like Sushi should be more elegantly served on a fancier plate...just my opinion.",

Lucky for us, it was freezing and had another couple who came in at the same time--the place was empty with only one person eating by the bar. I thought to myself, this is such a local joint that people often will swing by on a saturday night indeed. The staff was ultra friendly and prompt by letting us know where we can sit ourselves and just pick wherever. The place was clean and the service was quick since we got there pretty early.  As our dining experience came along, more and more people got in and placed their orders. My son ordered 3 rolls, and all of which were pretty tasty and good. Towards the later part, since it got busy, his last 2 rolls came a little late that he had to wait for them a little bit longer. He just told me that the spider roll was too huge, and it wasn't bite size-friendly, that it almost could resemble and be their 'sushi burrito' which they also served in this place. Other than that, my wife and i ate the chef specials, the carpaccios, and the hamachi kama were the highlights of our evening.  Altogether, the staff was attentive and very friendly. I would definitely go back to this sushi joint.",

They have many options on their menu, from small plates to soup Raman, Nigiri, rolls, sushi buritto... They can let you do dinner menu on the noon, (at the dinner rate, of course) which you will have more options and many of those items are better. We did that today and so worth the price. They did have some items on the menu which listed as one per order, we tried some of those, high quality and very delicious. I like the blue fin tuna and sweet shrimp very much, highly recommend. Their Nigiri is pretty good, it comes with right amount of the rice, really good. Also the potion of the dishes is great, you can try many different items. They also have ice cream items on their AYCE menu, those are nice too. I like this restaurant and I highly recommend",

I knew that it had replaced the old restaurant Shobu that was there - for this reason, I was not really sure if I wanted to go eat at this sushi place, because I thought it would just be the same as Shobu but just a new name. But when nurses and doctors of all races were raving about how fresh the sushi was and how good everything was on the menu, I knew I had to check it out.   When I first arrived, I was seated immediately, but then the seat was taken from me haha The waiter did not know there was a waitlist and apologized like 10x for the mistake. It wasnt a big deal, because we were seated within 10 minutes anyways. The decor of the place is exactly the same as the restuarant that used to be there, except there are pictures of all the sushi chefs on the walls - really huge pictures of them as if youre in an episode of iron chef!   My friends and I chose the AYCE option - dinner is 24.95 and I think lunch was only 21.95. There were lots of choices to choose from, especially in the appetizer section. I have never seen an appetizer menu that big and full of different things. I probably tried about half the things on it! They come out in very small portions so its perfect in that you can try a little bit of everything without getting too stuffed! When our sushi started to come out, I noticed that the rice to fish ratio was great! More fish than rice is always a good thing. Also, the fish was very fresh and so dericious. They don't do half orders though. oh well.   If you have trouble picking something, the waiters are more than willing to help you pick something. Just tell them what youre feeling or what types of fish you want with what type of style and BAM! they tell you what you should get haha  I am definitely coming back here again!!! They also have a happy hour session that I am planning on trying out!!!",

They drink and joke around with guests. Sometimes they send special creations our way. The four chefs are Kookoo, Choochoo, Hickey, and Sponge and they have epic portrait banners behind them. It's a unique place.   The one time I did sit at a table, the service was lacking a bit. The server seemed to avoid us.  I would say in all the times I've gone here, there's never been a wait, except for once it was 10 minutes (weird because the host didn't tell us how long to wait), and an hour and a half one super busy night (very unexpected).",

It no longer features the things that made this sushi spot unique. Instead it's now just another general sushi restaurant. The veggie options have been reduced to the basics. There is no longer the wonderful creativity in the veggie options. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant for veg heads anymore.   This is one of my favorite sushi restaurants in Las Vegas, it's clean and extremely friendly. It is extremely pleasant every time I've eaten here. While I've never had there all you can eat special every roll I've had has been fantastic.   Some people may not like this, but it adds authenticity and excitement for me, but the rolls can be inconsistent based on the chief that prepares it. The basic flavors are the same, but they have a slightly different personality. This shows the talents of the chiefs along with their ability to add their own artistic flavors to the food.   They also have a good range of vegetarian options, which is always refreshing for veg heads like me. If you are in the area, give it a try.   I can't wait to visit here again!   P.S. On my last visit, Yuna our server, was very bright and friendly",

    "text": "Negative 2 stars for crappy service. Server was rude. Never refilled our drinks. Had to keep walking to her to get her attention. Server was never here. Kids were eating rice and had some that they dropped on the floor. Asked for spoons for the kids to eat their rice but server kept forgetting so they stopped eating rice. We were the only ones in the restaurant so they weren't busy. She kept disappearing and forgetting our orders but make sure to threaten us with leftover charges twice when we didn't even finish our food yet. Food taste terrible. Fish is not fresh. Uni tasted bad, had a rotten smell. I clearly do not understand the high ratings here. What a miserable dump. We had to walk to front to get server's attention to pay so we can leave. Server said she has to check our table and walked to our table to make sure all our food was gone so she would charge us for extra food. Server warned us she will charge us next time if we dont finish left overs. I told her to go ahead and charge us and left her a big fat zero for gratuity. I just don't understand where this hostility came from. Guess wat? We will never come back and that $15 leftover charge is ur tip!!!",

When we walked in, there was actually light inside and it felt vibrant being in there. The workers were super nice especially our server. We couldn't finish like 3 of our plates but he didn't want to charge us a la carte price so he told my friend while i was in the bathroom to just tell me he ate everything while i was in there LOL  Good sushi, I don't know what makes it different from other AYCE sushi bar and restaurants other than the interior decor but it was still a good place to try. Dinner was about $27 a person. It's wprthit if you can eat a lot and they also have stamp cards! lol",

We went here with a local friend who comes here often. So don't know if we had a special treatment, of a normal one. But all together a nice experience.  The food is delivered quickly to the table. Most things together. You can order multiple pieces at once. No hars rules. Only thing we noticed was that we liked the nigiri much, much more than the rolls. But that can be a personal thing. Something we would really recommend is the salmon belly. Very good.  We will definitely visit this place again when in town.",

Fish Meats on Nigiris are not fresh at all. You can tell it is kept for days. 2.) Rice is not compiled correctly, loose af. 3.) Disproportion amount of rice vs. meat. It's like they are stuffing you with rice.  Customer Service: 1.) I've asked one of the employee (presuming it is the manager or owner) what is the reason for the qualities of the sushi, and in response he told me \"Idk, what do you want me to do, you want me to ask the chef out and talk to you?\" 2.) The waiters and waitresses were polite, except for one of the employee's bazaar behavior.  Honestly after eating at Hikari, so far there isn't a local AYCE sushi better than them (Again, excluding fine dining sushi restaurants). In addition, lol I do not represent anyone except for myself.",

Their nigiris are proportioned, good rice to fish ratio. Their special rolls are out of the ordinary as well.  I personally love the big easy roll and dancing tiger roll. Ask for the hickey special roll of Hicky is working:) Lissa hand roll is soooo good. I've tried a green tea shot and man, that was unforgettable!  Ambiance- all sushi chefs are fun to hang out and talk too. My favorites are obviously Hickey and Kookoo! I love sitting at the bar and hanging out with the chefs. They definitely take care of you and always asks if you want anything special.  Cons- sometimes the servers are not that attentive specially if your sitting at the bar and wanting to order dessert or appetizer. I usually find myself looking for someone to place an order.  Overall, I love this place! There is definitely room for improvement but the food definitely keeps me from coming back!:)",

You can't forget the array of delicious appetizers from scallops, calamari, soups, salads, baked mussels, and heck even a spicy chicken wing if you want.   I'm not a big fan of completely raw sushi but the must try rolls are definitely \"taste like my ex girlfriend, Cali on top, and the play boy special. Delicious.   The location was recently remodeled and looks great. Staff is friendly but expect a wait on Fri/Sat for dinner. It was voted #1 sushi place so it draws a big crowd.   Love this place!",

You can only order one per person so I ordered one for everyone and ate it all lol.  Another amazing feature of Jjanga is the service. Waiters are constantly moving around, checking on drinks, taking away empty plates, and the energy here is so fun! Its one of the best services I've experienced in awhile.  Oh and the chef sent us a free sashimi dish while we were here. How awesome is that??  Definitely coming back soon.",

The food is great, at a great price, and even involves a vegetarian special and a specially spicy section, for those of us with specific tastes. The staff was friendly and wanted to make sure they accomodated their custmers' needs. The design, the interior, spacious and very well designed. I can't wait until the karaoke opens up.

And although they have a location that's only 5 min drive away, I'd rather do the 10-15 min drive to visit this location instead. Two words: SPEEDY SERVICE.  || SERVICE || For awhile I stopped visiting here just because it was more convenient for me to dine at their new location, but service was always a struggle. Since we were in the area, myself and 10 others decided to go for some AYCE sushi and chose JJANGA. TEN PEOPLE. You know you're asking for some long wait times for anything. We were seated within 10 minutes in their private room. I only hang with sushi pros, so we were ready to order immediately. Pages and pages of orders for our poor server, but I kid you not, as soon as the last person finished ordering, the first dish came out. WHAAAAAT?? I know, doesn't that sound so wonderful!? We were so shocked, and 3 min after that, the plates just started rolling in and filling are table.   || FOOD || I love the fact that they have a good handful of options for no rice rolls and they don't limit you. Probably my favorite thing about this place really, because I hate filling up with rice. I'm not going to say that the quality is absolutely impeccable like its fresh fish that's being flown in twice a week, but for an AYCE, I am definitely quite happy with the quality. As for the rolls, I'm not a roll person, but they do have quite a bit of variety so you roll lovers have lots of options! No half roll orders though!   || AMBIANCE ||  A causal spot that's great for dates. If you're flying solo, definitely grab a seat at the sushi bar. Sushi chefs are friendly and great company!   Happy eating!",

Well i say umiya comes very close but what I love about jjanga besides their huge selection of sushi.. (Hand rolls included) is the freshness of everything they serve! I haven't had a bad uni (sea urchin), salmon or hamachi here ever!!! And I eat a lot of em..   Definitely worth the wait and worth the $$",

And at 5P on a Monday, avocado rolls, a veggie roll, tastes like my ex-girlfriend, and dancing eel. Those were the good rolls minus the veggie roll that we did not like (it had a nice crunch and was very fresh).  What made this excellent sushi were a few unique \"dishes\": the screaming orgasm (appetizer of seared tuna on a bed of radish), the spring mountain roll, and the monkey burrito (we ordered a 2nd).   The first few rolls were delivered within 5 minutes after we ordered and the rest not all at once but in a nice progression. Freshness, great taste, and spicy sauces. Our 9 year old and 11 year old provided the ultimate compliment. In general, they both enjoy and will answer \"Sushi\", when we ask 'What would you like for dinner?' but they what they like and they do not like all sushi. After one bite of those three, all they could say was \"More please.\"  Get some...",

Another awesome  thing about this sushi spot is they have happy hour 11-1 on weekdays for 20 bucks which a lot of other sushi places don't offer, definitely a plus.

Got the popcorn shrimp roll, the picture looked very appealing, it came and it literally was fried popcorn shrimp sitting on sushi...kind of weird. Reminded me of Captain D's or something bad like that. Anyhow overall food was not good at and would never recommend or ever order again. Waste of $50 and we went to bed hungry. Boo.",

Sometimes the food is really good and sometimes very poor quality. And sometimes, within the same meal, you can have inconsistent quality of food.  But when it's good, it's really good, though. Perfect rice to fish proportion, fresh ingredients, food comes out fast, very fast, efficient and friendly service, seasoning on point! But when it's bad...too much rice, too little fish, the same kind of sushi on the same plate can be made different shapes and sizes - some will have more rice, the fish will be different thickness, different size and different shape, the seasoning will be different. Once I ordered the grilled mackerel and not only was it overcooked, it smelled so bad. When the server came to take it away after our meal, I pointed out that it wasn't fresh, she took one look at it and said, \"Oh yeah, it's not fresh.\" So why serve it?  But the one thing that they've managed to be consistent in - rude chefs. The customers see how rude they are to the servers. When they make a mistake, they're pissed off and blame the servers. Under the old management, the chefs were rude when the owner was not around. But under the new management, they're rude all the time. Once, one of the chefs asked a man sitting at the bar to give us our order (I'm assuming that the man owns the restaurant or he is the manager because he walks in and out of the kitchen), the man turned to us and rudely said, \"Hey, is this your order?\" and made us get up and get the plate from him! We could also hear him yelling at the workers. Fantastic management style!  Have not gone back and probably won't.",

Our family goes to AYCE sushi quite often and typically appetizers are barely 1/4 cup of food and twice the price.  Restaurant was clean, and the staff was very attentive and sweet. Our server, Alex, had a lot of suggestions for us to try and was SO knowledgeable about the menu, that he could list ingredients in some rolls right off the top of his head. He was also very personable and was patient with all our questions about the menu.  All in all, extremely positive experience and I've already suggested it to a handful of my sushi lover friends",

The waitress was extremely nice and even recommended popular dishes, which turned out to be very delicious. So if you don't know what to choose, don't be afraid to ask the waiter. Their recommendation will turn out to be more of the delicious dishes. She even checked up on us once in a while to see how we were doing.the fish was very fresh and the portions were hearty. Starting off with the appetizers and then the sushi nigiri will help you leave room for the rolls. Don't forget to take advantage of trying out the green tea and red beam ice cream to complete the meal! I think my time here couldn't have been any better! Would definitely come back :)",

    "text": "I wish I could give this 4.5 stars.   The food here is about 3.5 stars. The AYCE deal is pretty great; tons of special rolls and sushi, appetizers, and desserts to choose from and everything gets made pretty quickly and to your table so you don't run out of time. (You get 1 hour of ordering time for dinner, which really is quite enough if you're ordering a couple to several things at a time). I have had many items here that were delicious, almost every single roll and cut of fish has been excellent. The only roll I didn't like was the Red Rock--it has some sort of sweet-ish sauce that just didn't work for me. Unfortunately, I had to finish it or pay a la carte price for it due to AYCE rules.  It's the service here that really rocks. There are several servers roaming at all times, taking orders from everyone (which makes sense, since they don't have to keep track of prices for each table). That means it never takes more than a few seconds for an empty plate to get picked up, an empty glass to be filled, or an order for more food to be taken. Everyone is super friendly, efficient, and really obviously trying to make sure you have a good experience. That accounts for much of the high rating for me.",

Our table was really close to the table next to us, but this didn't bother me in the least. The atmosphere is really loud and fast-paced, with music going and conversation filling the whole place. People from the karaoke room even danced by in the dining area at one point.   My 3 favorites were I love my ass, Taste like my x girlfriend, and Screaming Honey which I think is a must-try. The salmon was perfect as far as temp and texture go for a fried item. I almost didn't order it, so glad I did, because it was my favorite!  I had hot green tea and my cup was never empty :) They walked around with the teapot with perfect attention. And it was only $1! For being as busy as they were, they were well staffed, attentive, and fast. The host, waitress, food runner, and busser, and maybe another server or 2 stopped by without being intrusive to check our table and clear and refill. Very good!   Definitely do AYCE, especially if you're with a few people. Prices are awesome. Would definitely go back.",

I honestly order the same thing everytime i go to sushi and figure out what i like best.   Appetizers-4/5 Baby Octopus (5/5)- This was my favorite Shrimp Tempura Salmon Collar  Oysters   Nigiri- 3/5 Garlic Tuna  Super White Tuna Albacore Yuzu Yellowtail- this was good Masago Amaebi w/ shrimp Heads  Hand Rolls- 3.5/5 Salmon Skin Spicy Scallop  I really think its comparable to other sushi restaurants i didnt eat as much as i wanted to because im trying to watch what i eat but i did have 2 rounds of nigiri so was pretty full. The service was awesome everything came out quick and multiple people were there to fill up my water and ask me if i liked and everything was ok. Only bad thing i can really say about this place is it didnt wow me ive probably eaten at AYCE establishments all over town and they have a similar taste to everything.  The place had a great ambience to it and i look forward to eating here again but still this would be my second choice. Id still go to my favorite first",

    "text": "After hearing so many positive reviews, we were so excited to try this AYCE sushi for lunch.  To be expected at AYCE sushi, the quality of the fish wasnt great but not bad... the nigiri was good, but most of the rolls fell apart before we can dip it in the soy sauce.  The \"no rice rolls\" seemed like a great option, but unfortunately, they were tasteless and covered in so much of the spicy mayo sauce.   Menu is also inconsistent and not intuitive. While 1 order of agedashi tofu is a single cube of fried tofu or 1 piece of gyoza, you get 2 pieces of shrimp tempura or 2 pueces of nigiri sushi.  While one side provides an explanation of each of the specialty rolls, the back side is confusing with so many \"rules\" - some items are available for dinner only while other items are available both meal period but only 1 order per person.  The server was nice; however being so new, she didnt know the ingredients in the big menu nor the Japanese equivalent.   Hopefully, it was just an off day",

I've been avoiding him since I found this place, with an extensive menu, innovative rolls, and super-fresh fish!  Menu has a lot to explore, and I love that the rolls aren't just your standard \"special\" rolls on everyone else's menu in town. The cowboy roll with seared beef on top especially caught my attention. Mega bonus points for having SIX RICELESS ROLLS! SAY WHAT!? Unheard of, and they're almost all delicious. Freshmen Roll, Spring Mountain Roll, and Tuna Naruto are my favorites in this category. The handrolls and \"burritos\" are huge and delicious- pick from the Monkey Roll or go classic with salmon skin.   Side and appetizer dishes here are also pretty unique (ask for several of the mushroom ball), and the nigiri is thick-cut and delicious- appreciate how they use a proportionate amount of rice rather than gigantic mounds, as found elsewhere in town.   AYCE lunch price (til 3PM) is a super-reasonable $21, dinner is open til 2AM and goes up to $27- adds extra dishes like uni and amaebi nigiri, grilled mackerel, sashimi or poke salad, and mochi for dessert. Bummed that the mochi isn't available at lunch price, wish they'd add some desserts as they are a bit lacking in this area.",

Go in with the expectation that you just paid $3 for a spicy tuna roll; fish is not freshly caught and sliced a-la-Tsukiji, nor is rice lovingly fanned like a form of art. Instead this place just hits the spot with affordability as well as a lack of formality or pretentiousness.  AYCE rules:  - $20.95 for lunch (45 min only) - $25.95 for dinner (no time limit) - Extra charge on unfinished items. No sharing between AYCE and a la carte people of course.   A la carte: - Small hot dishes priced around $3 - Basic rolls at $3 for 8 pieces - Soup and salad $2 - Fancier rolls $8  A good fit for sushi on a budget.",

I tried JJANGA in west of 215 a while back because some iPhone repair guys said JJ was way better than Sushimon. Since I live close by the west location off I went to that one.  No, it wasn't better than sushimon by any imagination, save for the bigger space and fancier decor and benches for my derriere. But then again I came to eat sushi not sit on sushi. At the west locale, I did not like their sauce all over the sushi and was not fond of the service there. I swore I would never go back again. A friend said the original place was better and wanted to meet there and try it out. Well, guess what? This place is worse.   The tuna fish is weird. They don't look fresh. The tuna is not firm but almost like its been lightly ground thru a grinder. But it's very red probably due to food coloring. It looked like the tuna and salmon but had liberal amounts of color added in. The salmon looked rubbery so I did not even bother to try them. I don't like sauce drizzled on my sushi either. We aren't eating salads here. The eel came out big but it got leathery when cold. The salmon roe did not look or taste that fresh. They looked like they were starting to gel together.  The rice less rolls were good but I don't like sauce on top of them. The nude rolls and octopus were 2 good items here. The rice rolls are either wrapped in rice noodle sheets like spring rolls or they are in cucumber sheets. These rice less rolls seem to be their signature. The miso soup is an experience into the bland devoid of tofu or seaweed. It tastes like they diluted the bottom of the pot with more water to serve more people.  The service was good and bad. While they cleared the plates away quick, no one bothered to refill your water. Until the check came out that is. I'm guessing they want you alive to pay the bill. As it was a 2pm lunch, there weren't that many tables eating to begin with. On the menu it says there is happy hour from 11pm-1am. I am guessing you can get the lunch pricing and menu at that time. Well I am not impressed when I am sober so I don't think I will be impressed when I am drunk eating at that time either. Pass. Believe the 3 star Elite reviewers, just go to somewhere closer like the one near Tea Planet.  Lunch is $20.95 and dinner is $5 more. Pricing is in line with other sushi restaurants in the valley.",

Not the biggest place compared to some of the other ones but FAST service once seated, servers are extremely friendly and tentative and always answer your questions or gives wonderful recommendations. Quality of the fish is fantastic for an AYCE place. And they also do rewards go there 10 times get a free AYCE!!! Can't believe they do that. Good place to go in small groups so you can try a whole bunch of different rolls and appetizers, extensive list of options.",

Everything else is ruined mostly by the short-tempered chef.  He raised his voice, gestured, and gave dirty looks to all the servers.  When you treat the people who work for you like garbage - it's a clear reflection of how you think of yourself, how you treat your food and business.  These poor servers walked away from this idiot with tears in their eyes several times.  Not only the turn over will be high, but their dedication to the boss, the chef, the business, and the clients will be destroyed.  Shame on this chef for having no control on his emotions. Shame on him for embarrassing his staff in front of customers.  I'm never coming back because people like this rarely change at that age.  It may be a cultural thing and I get that.  I'm a foreigner too. But we are in America now. Grow the hell up and learn the rules and how to control your temper.  Sexist too. Mostly was rude to female servers and not the male.  So old-world.  Such a bad vibe.  Terrible.  I thank all the servers from the bottom of my heart for their hard work.  And remember - ITS NOT YOU.  ITS HIM! About food.....  The Uni was old and bad.  Most pieces of raw fish were tiny.  Cooked meats were overlooked.  Rolls represent Japanese cuisine and culture in a horrible light.  The hot tea was resembled hot water. I couldn't tell actually if there was any tea in it.  \"Real\" wasabi was not very real and didn't have a kick.  Tofu which is suppose to be smooth, cold, and melt in your mouth was horrible dried piece of cardboard.  We both ordered Sweet Shrimp.  We got two shrimps and six heads - WTF?!?!   Quail Egg is on the menu, but when I requested it - I was told that they haven't had it for a while.  Not sure what else to say.....",

But since we were craving for good sushi we decided to visit Jjanga at Decatur Blvd.  We were greeted graciously and were seated right away.  Sarah, our server, was quite attentive and made sure we had what we needed/wanted.    We ordered Chirashi bowl from Chef Jjanga and were served with one of the best sushi bowls we've had so far!  All the fish cuts were fresh and tasted really great.  Can't help but take picture of the wonderful work of art.  Thanks Chef Jjanga for a wonderful culinary experience.  We will definitely come back for more great tasting morsels.",

    "text": "Yesterday I would have told you I have given up on AYCE sushi in Las Vegas.  Not that I have given up eating AYCE sushi (I would rather give up sunshine), but that I have given up expecting anything better than marginally fresh, questionably acceptable slices of fish on a ball of tasteless rice. This is what we have come to expect from the AYCE joints in town - from joints that pre-cut the individual sashimi slices, letting oxygen start to kill the taste and texture, to places that serve a thin slice of lemon on top to mask the tell-tale signs of fish that is about to go bad.  Today I am singing a new tune - watch me do my little happy dance (clap along if you feel that sushi is right for you).  JJANGA has restored my faith in AYCE sushi and brightened up my whole year. I have once again found an AYCE joint that serves fresh fish (Rod my friend - if you're reading this, I watched them pull the fresh filets of Salmon out of the ice myself, so maybe they got your message).  But the star of the day wasn't the salmon, or the yellowtail (which were both amazing BTW), it wasn't even watching Choo Choo perform with graceful precision - the star of the day was the tuna. Absolutely gorgeous to behold and a joy to devour, the tuna was just about as perfect as perfect can be. The same delicate quality of fish you can only find in some of the better pay-per piece sushi joints, with the added glory of a never-ending supply. (Oh, this has gotta be the good life, this has gotta be the good life.)  When was the last time you remember an AYCE sushi joint serving eel that is still warm and fresh from the toaster oven and not cold because they precooked it to save time? When was the last time you remember Cajun albacore tasting like Cajun at all (has it ever)? When's the last time the garlic sauce on the garlic tuna made you go \"Ooooo\"? When was the last time they served you REAL wasabi at an AYCE? Huh? Go ahead, try to think of a time!  Simply an amazing lunchtime AYCE, better than expected by far, and they managed to top off great sushi and great service with an AYCE price a couple of dollars lower than most everywhere else in town - money! (I gotta feeling, that tonight's gonna be a good night!)  Anyone care to join me on Monday for round two?",

The sushi orders came and each had a HUGE chunk of rice and a paper thin piece of fish. The quality of fish wasn't very fresh either. The restaurant was pretty dead on a weekend night, which is a good indication of the quality. We also ordered a few appetizers to share and all the meat dishes were absolutely disgusting, super dry and the meat all tasty rubbery and not fresh at all. The rolls were also not very good, overly sugary and full of mayo and other dressing. Service was nice but the food did take a while to come out.   Would not go out of my way to come here!",

    "text": "I went in for lunch 3/15/16 around 12:30. I was expecting it to be busy but I was seated right away. I had a whole booth and pretty much whole corner of the restaurant to myself. I was then given water and a menu. I opted for AYCE lunch @ $20.95. AYCE includes most apps, rolls and dessert, but all of the items listed in RED are for dinner only.  I chose the following items:   Gyoza  Kiss Me roll Japanese Lasagna roll Double D roll Joe's Special Roll  The rolls are broken down on the menu by type. So for example all the spicy rolls are listed together, as well as the baked rolls and shrimp tempura rolls etc. My server recommended to me two rolls;  the kiss me and double d. And I chose the lasagna roll and Joe's special roll myself. Turns out 3/4 rolls I ordered had shrimp tempura in them.   The gyoza were tasty, they came fresh and hot to the table. There was 2 per order. There was no dipping sauce that accompanied them, but instead the sauce was drizzled over the top. I would order these again. 3/5.  Next came the kiss me roll. Inside it had shrimp tempura, crab, cucumber, and on the top was avocado, spicy tuna and screaming orgasm sauce. I really liked this roll and would order again 4/5.  Double D roll had shrimp tempura and cucumber on the inside, and spicy crab, tuna, salmon and orgasm sauce. This roll was similar to the kiss me and I liked it. The orgasm sauce is different than most sauces, it's not very heavy and it's quite tasty. 4/5  Joe's special roll had shrimp tempura and cucumber inside, and tuna, avocado and spicy garlic ponzu sauce on top. I enjoyed this roll the best. The spicy ponzu sauce was a good complement to the fish. 4/5  Japanese lasagna roll is my go to roll whenever I eat sushi. It's a california roll baked with cream cheese and eel sauce on top. It's really yummy but super rich.I chose to eat this last because of the richness, and actually It turned out to be my least favorite too. 3/5  All in all, I would come back here for lunch. My waitress was sweet, the rolls came out quickly and the price can't be beat for AYCE. Also they have karaoke rooms so I think I will bring some friends and we will have sushi and sake and do some singing.",

I can no longer recommend Jjanga as a solid spot for AYCE sushi. Their quality and credibility has gone down. Waaay down. They used to be decent but, man, I was utterly disgusted on our recent visit.   - Their AYCE (all rice) nigiri are soaked in an offensive chemical tasting \"yuzu\" flavor - Their (rice) rolls are literally all rice and a dot of imitation crab with a paper thin sliver of dried out salmon - Watery-bland-miso-soup - Sinewy, dried out, paper thin fish - Skimpier than a mofo \"special sashimi\" poke salads, that all have questionable, stringy, bad cuts of fish - Oh, they also don't do half sized rolls so be prepared to Tetris the shit out of your food  No can do. This is not the spot for AYCE sushi or value. They are drastically inconsistent, which is why I am confidant in awarding them with a 1 star review and never plan on returning.  Pro tip: Try Sakana on Maryland Pkwy, Las Vegas - they don't skimp on their rolls or their nigiri (plus their yuzu actually tastes good)",

I come here at least twice a month and the quality is superb. The nigiri is very fresh and I particularly love getting the beef tataki and salmon belly. Mmm the salmon belly is so smooth and buttery, it is just delicious. Everything I've tried here so far I've enjoyed. Some of my favorites include the Mistake, Pink Lady, Touchdown and the regular hamachi, unagi, and tobiko. All the chefs are very friendly and helpful in helping you find something that you enjoy. Also, the grapefruit soju is amazing! The flavor is great and you barely notice that it has alcohol in it, which is both good and very dangerous! If you come here be sure to ask for a stamp card, after the tenth AYCE stamp you can get a free one!",

(It was Friday lunch time, restaurant was not full) Over all: if you don't mind the wait time and some confusion over ordering food you can give it a try, but if you want to bring your friends and try to impress them, you will leave disappointed with a full stomach of wait time instead of food.",

I can't tell you how much I have loved everything I have tasted at this sushi bar! Good job chef!!",

It gives you a sense of privacy while you're enjoying your meal. And the food was great! I went during their happy hour time after midnight, where it's all you can eat & it came out to be very worth it. The prices are reasonable & the menu has plenty of options to choose from. The only thing that I didn't like was that they didn't offer any kind of cocktails. They only had beer options & I'm not much of a beer drinker. I would have loved to enjoy my sushi with a nice cold Mai-Tai. Other than that, the place looked great & the food was delicious. I also noticed they have a karaoke section that was closed. I'd definitely love to come back & next time try to do some karaoke! I love karaoke!",

As we were ordering he would just jot it down not say a word and walk away. Other people kept coming to take our empty plates away but no one ever asked how we were doing or if we needed anything else. We were obviously ready for round two as we sat there staring at them as they passed by and ignored us for about 5 mins, finally I decided to flag our server down so we can order more. He stood there and jotted our order again, never once did he apologize or smile. Best advice i can give here is hire someone with somewhat of a personality because the robot of a person that helped us was just horrible. I feel bad for writing this review but I think customer service is the key to the success of all businesses.",

Our server was nice, but the first strike was when she told us we couldn't order anymore surf clam because apparently 4 orders was the limit, but that seemed like an arbitrary decision because no where on the menu did it say there were limits on certain items. The second strike is the lack of service throughout because it took so long for her to come back to us to take our orders and the wait became longer after every order, and we didn't even order frequently. The final strike was when we ordered a single item (I forgot what it was), and had been waiting for it for probably 10 minutes to be informed that they had it, but it was going to take a long time to cook it and we politely understood. Another 10 minutes later, we started to become skeptical of why it took that long, then another server informs us that it's actually \"MIA\" and that they actually don't have the ingredients for it, so they pretty much lied to us about it and were bold enough to think we'd believe them. So considering all the strikes, that's when we were pretty sure that they didn't want to serve us anymore because they probably thought we ordered too much or maybe because they thought we were sharing with some of my family members who had a la carte. It was just an awful experience of feeling like they wanted us to stop ordering and just leave because we \"exceeded\" the cost and they were probably losing money so they felt as if they had to solve it by trying to avoid us.",

    "text": "I am giving this restaurant 4 stars with guarded optimism.  We started going there about 4 months ago and it seems to be slipping in quality.  Perhaps the most annoying thing recently has been their a/c issues. Hopefully it will be truly fixed soon.  Unfortunately, we had to leave during one of our attempts to dine there.  According to their own thermostat the temp in the restaurant was 89 degrees!  One of our party is 89 years old and we felt it unwise to sit and swelter. I admit to being disturbed by the attitude of one of the servers who was chiding me for leaving after all the trouble he went through to setup a table for 5.  Really? No compassion for the senior with us.  One wonders how good an idea it is to serve sushi in such a warm room.  Scott the manager was not there but probably would have handled things better.  Hopefully they will fix the a/c better and not complain if people choose not to stay.  Actual sushi is good but again the quality seems to be slipping.  Service is ok.  Hardest working person there is the young busboy.  Guardedly 4 stars but beware of future decline.",

I didnt complain because I was also alredi full and done eating. however, the next day I was sick. idk if it had anything to do with the sushi though. the server was nice btw. idk his name. Oh also he didn't charge us for the leftover shrimp sushi we didnt finish which was good because it was full of some chemical.  I did order sake, good thing they didnt ID us. Honestly idk why it has such good reviews. like I said, nothing special. have been to plenty of better sushi places around here. I wouldn't go bak though because it is far, out of my way, and didn't exactly enjoy my sushi like I usually do.",

    "text": "I came here solely because my co workers rant and rave about this place. We were seated quickly upon arrival. I don't know my servers name probably because he failed to pay attention to us, and give us a proper greeting. I heard this place gets pretty packed so the fact it was dead made me extra excited to eat! The first few orders come out, the salmon nigiri had this weird like blueish/whitish circle on all every piece and I was kinda freaked out about eating it, it resembled mold. The first roll came out and it look super good, the crumbs, the sauces, and the cuts were all equal. And for each roll after that it was down hill. For one there was only four tables max but three sushi chefs behind the bar with no one seating there. I tried to make eye contact with ANYONE and they all failed to pay attention. The chefs were more focused on themselves, they seemed to be able ot have conversations with everyone the host, servers, and some guy not wearing the uniform, not sure if he was a shift manager or what.. The didn't really want to make the sushi and that is for sure. The effort all around just sadly lacked, some rolls didn't have sauces on them at ALL. Some fish was left out, and my biggest pet peeve of all time is when the rolls are not cut the same size! And some were large some were tiny, and ontop of everything the food wasn't even rolled tight. The server wasn't taking plates from our tables, and was kind of just going around us the whole time. We didn't get our water refilled, and I am surprised we even stayed for as long as we did. I also have heard this location isn't as great as the other one. But I will NOT be checking this brand out again. Fish quality and service took a big 0/5 for me.  Also when my man had asked about substitutions for fish he just blurted out no, and anyone who works in the service industry (I DO) knows you never say no! Just word it differently and be polite about it!   *Mind you this was at 11pm and their happy hour had just begun sloppy food is expected when its close to the end of their shift but three hours before?*",

Best decision we ever made lol we tried just about everything and everything was delicious. The Ahi poke was great and the hand rolls were awesome too. There wasn't anything we didn't like. Service was on point they brought out everything well timed and not too much at once. Best $26 bucks ever spent on dinner. Will definitely be back and maybe checkout their karaoke rooms too :)",

    "text": "In an unseeming corner of an old business complex next to a small grocery store sits a new restaurant with a fresh facade--Jjanga Japanese Restaurant.  I came across their Yelp listing under New Businesses and decided to take my husband there for some lunch.  From the moment we walked in to the place, the service was positive, efficient, and ever-present.  I was surprised to find that this restaurant has a sushi bar, the main cuisine for their all-you-can-eat (AYCE) menu.  There are hundreds of AYCE sushi bars in Vegas, but this one is run by a very loved sushi chef from another very popular sushi bar, and his name is Jjanga.  Obviously, he owns the place, thus the self-titled restaurant.  He comes packed with three other sushi chefs at the helm: Koo Koo, Choo Choo, and Hickey.  You will remember their names because their Iron Chef photos with names on them sit high and mighty behind the sushi counter.  I fell in love with the place before trying the food just for that Iron Chef whimsy.  The other thing that caught my attention were the place settings at the bar.  Choo was our first sushi chef experience at Jjanga and is and forever will be dubbed the \"sushi hero\", because he rescued my negative ideas of certain pieces of fish and their delivery from the bowels of my personal food hell pit and resurrected them into favorites and desires.  To get to this point with Choo, we started off with a few familiar options for AYCE--saba and red snapper.I will be honest--from all my other sushi bar experiences in Vegas, I detest the sight and smell of saba.  I really, truly do.  When my husband orders it, I shove the plate his way to avoid that strong odor of saba in my nostrils.  This, however, was different.  I was puzzled by this plate; there was no fishy smell (despite it being fish), nor was there a dull gray tint to the saba.  It is clean, well cut, and topped with this crazy ginger cream sauce that is to die for.  I decided to check out this enigma for myself, closed my eyes, took one by the chopsticks and popped it in my mouth.  I chewed, waiting for that tangy taste to hit my palate, but lo!--no such thing occurred.  A nice, cured flavor of saba hit my taste buds with a hint of the sauce and well balanced sushi rice.  I actually fell in love with saba at that moment, ordering another round.  The snapper was clean tasting, just the right cut and was perfect without wasabi, soy sauce, or ginger.  I was excited to move on, and decided to tell Choo just to take the wheel.  We switched on omakase ((, o-makase meaning \"I leave it to you\").  Choo made his first creation--a beautifully wrapped roll that was rice-free, included salmon and tuna, avocado, radish, and topped with two sauces that, when intermingled on the tongue, just exploded with a bit of spice, sweetness, and citrus.  This experience was the most unique out of all the other sushi places we fare for one reason--the flavors are clean, the fish is beautifully cut and great quality, and those sauces are uber-umami powerhouses.  I was excited to see what would arrive next.  Unagi, or eel is what my husband ordered.  Another nigiri that I truly detest, one that has plagued my palate with nothing but oily fish residue and the smell of fish death topped with what I assumed was metallic, salty eel sauce.  Disgusting, right?  I was dead wrong.  Taking a chance based on my saba experience, I went mouth-first with the unagi, and I was completely shocked.  First, the eel sauce isn't really eel sauce in terms of flavors we are used to at other sushi restaurants.  It isn't gritty, metallic, soy gel.  This stuff is complex, umami, and gentle with whatever it compliments.  As I took one, the first thing that made it pleasurable was the unagi's temperature--warm.  It is reminiscent, to me, of foie gras, and in the best way possible.  The fat is delicious, the meat flakes and melts in the mouth, and with the eel sauce it's a double hitter of flavor, from a symphony of sweet to a hint of salty, and dissipating with that beautiful fatty flavor that eel should always provide.  I ordered six more of these babies in one sitting.  At Jjanga, they are doing things right by curing their saba in house, cooking the tako until tender, making their sauces, and getting their sushi rice to the right flavor.  By presenting each piece of sushi at different temperatures to enhance the experience, the fish tasted the way it should; I truly admire and appreciate that.  All whimsy aside, Jjango is fun and fresh, just like their offerings of sashimi, nigiri, and rolls.  It's about creating the right experience, presenting the fish in a way that creates a sumptuous moment. I sum it all up in three words: engrossing, thoughtful, and balanced.",

So, out of the blue she called JJanga and it became our go to place.    We have been here many times and I have yet to have a bum meal.  Service can differ from lunch to dinner but, that is the added human factor with eating out.  But, I would say that service has been pretty solid at night.  Scott, Janga and the rest of the night crew make it, not only a feast, but a good time.  I have never been to a place where the owner comes out and celebrates with his customers.  They treat the young ones incredibly as well.  They bring out a huge treasure chest for them to choose little toys from, a separate menu for those who are picky, and cute little plates to eat from.  When you wrap all of this up, you can see why we keep coming back again and again.  The rolls, appetizers,  and desserts are plentiful and tasty.    A few of my favorites are: The Freshmen Lion Roll Playboy WO7 Crab Balls  We not only found a great restaurant but, a few good friends as well..",

Where do they come up with the names for some of these rolls, lol?  Not a mochi fan, but my wife is. That was her main disappointment of this place. The skin on the mochi was not silky smooth. I liked this place better than Yama Sushi. The service was better, and I think the roll choices were better. I also think the quality and taste was very good.",

Didn't finish. Red rock roll - interesting fruity pebbley. I think I liked it. It looked really cool. Smoked salmon nigiri - smoked salmon on sushi rice. Nothing more. Amaebi - just like any other amaebi. Beef nigiri - bland. Screaming orgasm - yummy, laughable portion. Half rolls - non-existent.  Everything seemed fresh. I wasn't sick the next day or anything. Overall the food was okay. Not bad, not good.  Drinks:  $12 for a little bit of cheap house sake. The staff didn't even want to tell us what brand it was.  We were charged for our hot green tea even though it was Brown. It tasted very watered down like they have been using the same ol' tea leaves all day. The tea came in very small cups and needed to be refilled often. The staff would sometimes show that they were annoyed to do so.  Service:  We weren't greeted when we came in. No one acknowledged or existence when we left. The whole time we just felt unwanted. They just started at us simultaneously avoiding us. The busser was pretty good though. He was nice and attentive.  Overall:  Not a bad spot. I've definitely had worst. I would go back if someone wanted me to join them there, otherwise I have no interest to go back.",

I was pleasantly surprised at the spacious restaurant setting and the ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT Menu and prices. But the real treat came when the food arrived. The garlic tuna and smoked salmon were delicious, also had popcorn lobster and awesome baked green mussels. I also tried the lobster roll, the Johnny roll ( wrapped on cucumber) and their bacon roll. You should definitely try the golden scallop and the bbq chicken off the appetizer menu. But my absolute FAVORITE dish at Jjanga was their Mini Pork Skewer... It rivals Sushi Goyemon's pork belly, and to be honest, I think it is much tastier overall. All in all, JJANGA was a pleasant surprise and will now be part of my monthly sushi rotation...",

The cool part is that the entire group does not have to order all you can eat, but the person eating a la cart cannot eat share food from people doing all you can eat. The menu is very extensive..I wish I had more people with me when I visited this place. I stuck to the nigiri especially the salmon, albacore, and yellowtail. There was also baked mussels which were pretty good and tried out the seaweed. You can also order dessert from the all you can eat menu and I got the green tea ice cream (yum).  Overall not bad for the price you pay at an all you can eat sushi. The service though was painfully slow. I felt like I had to order in big batches to makes sure I got everything in time. I would suggest that if you come to visit that you're not rushing because then you can't enjoy the food as much!   Otherwise, would definitely stop by again if not in a time crunch. Service was ok, I think we had like 3 different servers, so they would keep mixing up our orders.",

Enter JJANGA...  The Good:  Quality of Fish! You'd think you were eating at a hip a la carte sushi joint the way the fish was so fresh.  The variety of rolls on the menu were outstanding. I'd say they have 80 different rolls in all. I recommend going with the \"non-rice rolls\"...it's not filling and each comes with an awesome sauce. I think I tried 4 of them and couldn't even take a picture they were gone so fast. They are on a separate section of the menu.  Appetizers were pretty standard, the fried shrimp with crab meat I think they call it \"who's your daddy\" was good.  I told the chef named \"Koo-koo\" that I loved yellow tail nigiri with sliced jalapeno and lemon and he hooked me up with a fat plate. Perfect.  I'm usually needing extra wasabi and ginger at some point in the middle of the meal, but one thing I noticed is that I hardly used any wasabi/soy sauce and ginger throughout the entire meal...it's a credit to how good these rolls are and how well the sauce compliments them.   They also have a Caucasian guy helping to serve the tables and help expedite along with the Asian servers which I thought was smart.  Water was always refilled and ESPN played muted behind the bar. I really can't find anything to dislike about this place. Even the Iron chef style giant posters of each chef working behind the bar were in good taste.  When they said, \"Thanks, see you tomorrow\"...I actually kind of thought about it.  Bravo JJANGA, well done.",

We had a few sake bombs and our friends tried the grapefruit sake, it was amazing!   I became obsessed with a few of the riceless rolls. They were rolled in cucumber, which made them so light and fresh. The next time we come here I honestly will stick to those. The Johnny Roll was my absolute favorite. Shrimp tempura and crab wrapped in cucumber then topped with a light fruit sauce... I'll take 5! The Q Roll and the Vegas Roll were great as well! My only complaint was it was super awkward trying to order from the chefs. They were super busy and it was difficult getting their attention. Other then that everything was perfect, can't wait to come back!",

I usually start with an order of Sake, Hamachi, and Ahi to test the waters on how fresh/enjoyable my experience will be.  Happy to say that they were offering one of the better cuts in town during my visit.  They are on par with some of the best choices around here IMO!  They also offered a couple different options to separate themselves from the competition:  I really enjoyed their Yuzu Hamachi.  The hamachi was fresh, and the yuzu was a nice compliment to the fish! Not overpowering like yuzu can be sometimes.  Hotategai. The scallops were delicious, and the masago was a nice consistency combination.   Hotate Ebi Skewer. The scallop and shrimp were cooked well, and doused in a mayo like sauce. Not bad!  Calamari Ring. Good! Fairly tender, with a very soft and flavorful breading with a mellow sauce drizzled on top.  My food came out extremely quickly...because I was taking pictures of the food once it arrived, it felt a little overwhelming how fast they were coming out.  Order in SMALLER batches than you are used to when eating sushi!!  Have fun :P",

    "text": "AYCE based sushi restaurant.   As AYCE places go, this is one of the better ones I have sampled. FIrst off, if you don't want AYCE their prices are pretty reasonable and you can have three special rolls for the same price as AYCE.  If you like simpler sushi/sashimi you can have up to 5 rolls.    The fish is very fresh and they have a lot of creative rolls.  The crab ball appetizer is excellent.  I was able to try the jackpot, grand canyon, golden scallop, crab roll, volcano, cowboy, and more.  Many of their special rolls are soft shell crab based which is not my favorite.  The menu, although with plenty of choices, seems to lean heavily in the tuna, salmon and crab arenas.  We received a sample of the salmon belly which was good.  The staff is very friendly and even has a box of toys for the kids so my daughter had a good time. She really enjoyed the Mel's roll, having three of them, and the crab balls.  There are several kids options on the menu yet surprisingly, none of them include sushi which was a bit disappointing.  The special rolls are named with risque themes so be prepared to answer questions from your child if you bring him or her.  Overall an excellent option if AYCE is your thing!",

AYCE prices are very reasonable, but they do have rules to follow, however they've never been a problem for anyone I've been there with. Everyone in the restaurant is super friendly and although you have a waiter, everyone who works there is willing to take orders, run to the kitchen, and generally help you with whatever you need. Food comes fast after being ordered and is always as described in the menu.   Food is delicious and yummy and tastes fresh. I love the I Love My Ass Roll, but the Pretty Lady Roll is always popular, and I don't think I've ever ordered few than 5 orders of the Salmon and the Garlic Tuna. The menu is extensive and for those who are not into fish, or raw fish, there is a cooked menu as well including bulgogi (which is delicious) and tempura among others.   I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who's looking for great sushi in the area!",

Don't believe any of the positive reviews on this sushi place, they must be fluffing them. Food? FAIL! service? MAJOR MAJOR FAIL!! Ambiance? FAIL! Place is awful! The sushi is low grade garbage when you even get it. They totally ignored our table! I am not even kidding, my daughter never even got her food in 52 minutes and we asked them 5 times and every time it was, \"don't worry\" what does that even mean? She only ordered Ikura and Masago. The plates came out one at a time every 15 to 20 minutes. Omg! They must be manipulating the reviews Yelpers! My wife and I are sushi snobs and we figured we would check it out because of the reviews on yelp, boy were we disappointed! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!! This was the first time in my 49 years of eating that I did not even tip 1cent, as a matter of fact, I honestly feel the server owes me money!

The quality of every piece of sushi is super fresh, and the rice underneath is small so in comparison you get so much more of your fav raw fish on top. For those who dont like raw foods theres also a huge collection of baked rolls and other cooked foods for you. The servers are very very polite and energetic, and all the orders came super fast, about one minute after i place the order. They do charge for left overs, but since each order has a small serving size you dont have to worry about ordering too much. I definitely recommend the garlic tuna, salmon belly(this isnt on the menu so ask them for it), poki salad, uni, flying fish egg, beef tataki, and the freshman roll. Also the choo choo special which is also not on the menu is amazingggg. I was worried that jjanga wouldnt live up to my impression of it last year, but it has most certainly surpassed it, and made me fall in love with jjanga once again. Thank you jjanga for this amazing experience! Hope I get to come back again next year!",

    "text": "Jjanga is a fabulous sushi restaurant. It has a great selection of fresh fish. My personal favorite wherever I go would be the garlic tuna. They also have this yuzu yellowtail, which has just the perfect amount of tang. The service here is not the reason why I come back. The servers are not very interactive and they become negligent as the night goes on. They tend to forget to refill drinks or take new orders when you have already made your first order of AYCE. Also, the a la carte menu is actually very decently priced for the sushi. I went in one day and I wasn't too hungry so I ordered a la carte and I was full and satisfied. However, for future note, you cannot upgrade from a la carte to AYCE. The oysters served here are odd-tasting compared to other locations because they put the fish eggs on them (and I personally hate fish eggs LOL). Overall, the restaurant has a great selection of rolls and nigiri. This place does not offer a lot for dessert though. You can only order one mochi per person. But the ice cream here is literally the best thing here! It is so rich, creamy and buttery. One time I went with my boyfriend and friend and we had a pretty large meal of nigiri, appetizers, soups, and salads. We also ordered three mochi (green tea and mango), and my friend started out with one red bean ice cream and one vanilla ice cream. And the ice cream was so good, we ended up order a total of 2 red bean ice creams, 2 vanilla ice creams, 1 green tea ice green, and 1 chocolate ice cream (this is for three people LOL). The chocolate ice cream had little oreo bits in it and it was so delicious. Overall, great place to dine. I used to go to Goyemon and Sushi on Tropicana but this place trumps all the others by a long shot. PS. If you're going to try the wings, do NOT get the spicy or the lemon pepper one. The only good one is the garlic wings. The lemon pepper wing was too overpowering and the \"spicy\" wing had a weird ketchup sauce on it that tasted like the \"sweet n sour\" sauce for pork ribs or chicken. It is not very good at all.",

Im giving them 3 stars because recently I've had pretty bad service. It appears the servers don't work sections or even tables. I had a group of 6 and we had four or five different people putting in orders and checking on us throughout the night. This worked out at first, but then of course we started getting ignored. I guess each server thought the other was checking on them, but it wasn't happening. We waited almost 45 minutes before flagging someone down to keep ordering sushi and to get a roll we head ordered what seemed like ages ago. Everyone was super friendly it's just inefficient. After all this flagging down we had to do, they of course tacked on a 20% gratuity and told us we could only split the check 3 ways, causing us to have to work out with each other who will be paying for who. All of this is making me less likely to return.",

    "text": "There is an AYCE Sushi place on 215/Durango I used to patronize religiously, until certain rolls became dinner only.  Based on the Yelp reviews, decided to give Jjanga a try.  The other reviewers were right about the wait, but it was well worth it.  We also grabbed another couple (we had no idea whom they were) and table shared, which I think startled the staff but made wait times shorter since a lot of us were just tables for two.  As a result, we got amazing service. The Red Bull roll is amazing--just the right amount of hot with a touch of sour/bitter.  Also great was the garlic tuna nigiri, the poki salad, and the cowboy special.  I was not impressed with the Arizona Roll, and that was the only downer of the night--without the ginger sauce it's very bland.   The fish was fresh, the service was as fast as it could be for a packed restaurant, the servers were attentive, and it has a really pleasant atmosphere.  We're new fans!",

Reasons: -great taste -less rice -flavor is awsome I want to underline  the speed with which the food is served, all employee courteous, respectful end and humble in the real sense. Keep up the good work guys. For sushi lovers: keep going there, keep them busy, that will bring the restaurant more revenue and with that hopefully more choices to eat. Thanks a lot JJanga Claudio T",

Otherwise, you'd have to flag down any server that walks by because your table will not be checked up on. The wait time for the food is RIDICULOUS! Expect to wait a long while for food. I can't even blame it on being busy either because there weren't much customers dining, probably about 4 other tables. Also, expect to repeat your orders more than once because it will be forgotten.  If you are a very patient person I would suggest this place, because although service is super slow the food is really good. Otherwise, I suggest their other location on Fort Apache.. MUCH BETTER service with much more attentive staff.",

I was introduced to Sumo Sushi from my high school best friend and went for the first time on NYE this past December.  My fiance and I really went because it was close to the house and an easy spot to eat before celebrating with champagne at home.  We were blown away by the staff and especially Captain Choo Choo.  They made us feel like family and asked us to become friends on Facebook so he could share with us updates on his new restaurant which we now know well is Jjanga!    We visited Jjanga the week they opened and wow this is the most special, amazing and innovative sushi/japanese restaurant in Las Vegas.  I was blown away by the sushi masters Choo Choo, Jjanga, Koo Koo and Hicky who welcomed us with open arms and even let me school them on the ways of Instagram to take a photo of us all!  I love these guys and the entire staff so much and think of them as family.  Choo Choo even gave my fiance advice on what moves in the bedroom would ensure we have a boy or a girl baby...tips we will use when the time is right.  Can't get preggers yet as the sushi is just too good to miss out on for 9 months!",

Do not be fooled by the neighbors construction or the pool hall's dumpiness. It is very nice inside and much bigger than you would anticipate (heh).    We did not do the AYCE, but it was reasonably priced at $25.95 (dinner). Our a la carte bill turned out to be about $50 for two people and here's what was on the menu:  2 Cold Draft Beers and 1 Large Hot Sake Nigiri (at $3 a set- splurge on the smokey and regular salmon) Fresh Men Roll- Holy Rolly. Riceless but delicious. Candy Cane Roll Red Rock Roll- I might pass this one up in the future due to a weird mint taste that we couldn't find the origins of.",

Me and a few friends did AYCE and ordered numerous dishes ranging from appetizers, sashimi, rolls, and then dessert. We could NOT find a dish that we didn't love.

The moment we walked in (no reservations) we were immediately greeted and saw the place packed that we waited less than 5 minutes.  The host apologized for the wait then finally sat us at a booth.   What I love about this place is how every server is on top of it!  I would forget the water was instantly refilled or how a finished plate disappeared from sight.   My favorite sushi rolls are the no-rice rolls like 'fresh men' or 'Johnny roll'! It's fresh and refreshing, and makes you feel like you didn't overdo it. A different spin to sushi!   Boyfriend's review (his two cents): it's live,  it's festive,  it's fun! Most sushi places are quiet and this place is always lively.  The food is great and service is great, bruh!

Servers are always on point with making sure you've ordered and making sure the food keeps coming out.  I enjoyed their Jjanga burrito, Yellowtail w/ Yuzu, salmon nigiri, as well as an array of appetizers like their bulgogi, crab ball & chicken wings. I love their \"Something Wrong 69 Roll\" which came with an amazing ponzu sauce. The \"Q Roll\" was amazing as well. For dessert I got a scoop of their chocolate ice cream. Im not over exaggerating when I say their chocolate ice cream is THE BOMB! Try it and you'll taste why.   I cant wait to try their new location on Sunset and 215!",

I can't say that service is perfect all the time, as I've had Goldilocks variations all three times (one time was so-so, one time was bad, the most recent time was great).   I feel like it's quite affordable for what you get, considering the rolls aren't ever extra small or oddly sized.  Sometimes you'll get complimentary rolls and soju. I was very fond of the grapefruit soju, I think it was sparkling as well. It was highly unlikely I would have ordered it, but now that I've tried it, I would consider it again sometime.   Our favorite rolls are the spicy ones: mexican roll and BYA. My favorite nigiri is garlic tuna and yuzu yellowtail. We weren't a fan of the no-rice rolls, which sound like a great idea at first, but the flavors weren't outstanding. (Perhaps we just happened to pick the two that had a creamy sauce - I think it was the Q roll and tuna naruto).",

The rice would fall apart.  The food takes forever to come out. Something like a house salad will take 20 mins. It's not even busy in here but it takes 20 mins for a house salad!  The sushi was definitely not fresh. They give you very little sushi and alot of rice in which we will get charged for left over... rice! Really?  The service is even worse. I would have to get up to look for some service. The waitress would look at our empty cup of water still no food on the table ( in which the food takes 45 mins) ask if everything is okay then walks away assuming we are okay. Helllllloooo?  When we placed an order in which each of us got 3-4 rolls she goes \"you guys can finish this? You will be charged\". Excuse me, if we couldn't finish it we would never order.  The place has fans. Fans! No AC when it is 100 degree outside. Who wants to eat sushi when it's hot INSIDE.  The sushi can't be fresh. Worse. ever.",

    "text": "3.5 stars.   This was my third visit here. I liked my first visit years ago when they had Korean entrees like bibimbap and budaejigae more than their conversion to a sushi place. The only items that are remotely Korean are the bulgogi app, sweet rice cakes and pumpkin soup  I ordered three nigiri, super white tuna, yuzu yellowtail and salmon as well as two rolls, the salmon and Alaskan roll. Yuzu and Alaskan roll were my faves  Although the sushi al a carte is more cheap compared to most places, (which is one reason we came here) you get what you pay for here.. Nigiri sushi was tinyyy! Lol salmon was lean, no fatty white lines that give it an almost buttery flavor and texture. Cuts of fish were also thin. Maybe they gave us the less appetizing parts idk. Rolls were just as small, but I appreciate that they didn't try to stuff the sushi with rice to make up for size.   You're probably better off getting AYCE here but I would honestly go to another place with the better quality fish,  not for what we were served here.   Service was good when we came cause we were the only ones in the restaurant but after another party came, it went kind of downhill.  I did like that they had Shirley Temple, twas great.",

The only reason why this review is getting 2 stars is because I enjoyed the food. But honestly the best tasting food can make you change your mind when it takes 30 minutes for you to get your first roll.   Upon entry the lady (guessing she was new because she DID NOT know how to serve at all and I'm a server so I was giving her the benefit of the doubt for the first 20 minutes) took our drink orders, which you think wouldn't take so long since all I ordered was water but no I had to flag down another server after 15 minutes of just sitting and waiting before I got my glass of water.   Placed our order and I did not get my first roll until we were sitting there for 30 minutes. Not to mention that all I ordered was nigiri! Later I asked for them to put a dash of Masago on top of my baked green muscles and our server proceeded to charge me EXTRA for a dash of Masago.  Extremely disappointed and will definitely not be coming back to Jjanga. Definitely letting my friends know not to come to Jjanga unless they want to be charged extra, get horrible service and wait 30 minutes for the first roll to come out.",

After a little wait we sat at the bar. They have such a large menu it was seriously hard to choose. I over heard the guy next to us ask the chef to just make him whatever he liked. I thought it was kinda crappy that they said they'd do it, but at the cost of dinner.  I didn't really enjoy all the rolls that we ordered. I did enjoy the Fat Ass roll. How could it be bad it was fried! The Philly roll had to much cream cheese. I really loved the fried baby octopus from the appetizer menu. The XXX roll was supposed to be super spicy, but lacked the spice I had expected. The worst roll of them all came off of the rolls with no rice, but used rice paper instead and was called the Fresh Men roll. It was covered in some pink sauce that literally made me gag.   The service was great and our water glasses were kept filled. It seemed clean, but the backs of my calves from sitting in the chair felt itchy the whole time we sat there. Really odd!  I was hoping for another tasty sushi spot, but this place just missed the mark. I'll for sure stick to other places I know are yummy in the future. I felt very disappointed with the flavor. Meh.",

Our food came out plate by plate, so we had time to indulge in each inividual order. We were never sitting waiting for more food, and our server continually took our order.   The all you can eat menu offers a lot of variety. The appetizers are unique-- grilled mackerel with dipping sauce; shrimp, pork and beef skewers, fresh oysters, and fried rice. The staples of baked mussels and shrimp tempura are also perfection! The nigiri is fresh, it has a good rice to fish ratio, and you can order pretty much any fish (I like uni, salmon belly and garlic tuna).  The servers are very knowledgeable of their menu. They offer great suggestions on which of their many rolls to order. They serve no rice rolls which are my favorite to prepare my belly for more food! I LOVE the Fresh Men Roll.   The last thing that makes Jjanga stand out is their poke. Not many AYCE joints serve poke yet this place has four different poke/sashimi dishes! That alone makes it worth the dinner price.   Jjanga my #1 sushi spot in Vegas!",

We did AYCE, and were super pleased with our selection of rolls. We took two suggestions on rolls from our server and she did us proud because those sushi rolls were Amazing!  I am so excited, I have a fantastic sushi restaurant so close to my house, I will be back for sure!  The two of us ordered 11 rolls and some appetizers we just split everything it was so delicious.   I highly recommend AYCE, here because the menu is quite impressive, if you are into sushi you will love it here. I liked how the rolls were less rice and more fresh product so we could try several rolls without being stuffed from rice overkill. Their sauces are delicious, the ginger sauce, screaming orgasm sauce, yum yum sauce etc, were on point depending on the roll selection.  They were on point with clearing empty dishes and keeping our drink glasses full of iced tea and water!  I have listed what we ordered below, all delicious sushi rolls! I will have to reference my review next time so we can do a repeat!  crab ball appetizer Washington roll Cowboy special roll Spider roll Japanese Lasagna Mountain roll Crunch roll Caterpillar roll Wo7 roll Jackpot roll California crunch roll Tiger roll red bean ice cream dessert green tea ice cream dessert",

So you can order just from the regular menu, but I don't know why anyone would. For $24.99 (dinner) you get all you can eat items. The items highlighted in red (their uni, mochi, scallops for example) are only one per person. However, if someone in your group doesn't particularly like those items you can enjoy theirs.  We got so much stuff. I highly recommend getting the scallop appetizer, the garlic tuna, the seaweed salad, their garlic edamame. Honestly, everything we had was super fresh and tasty. The servers came around often and food came out fast.   I cannot wait to go back there!",

    "text": "I have multiple friends who would recommend this place and even say this is their go to sushi spot. I mean, it's good but some areas could use improvement.   We came on around the beginning of their dinner time (4pm). We were the only two customers for a while so we were seated right away and served our drinks. The front hostess is a little awkward. I felt like she was talking too slow and lingered around our table even after I said we needed more time to look over the menu.   We automatically connected with this petite blonde server who served us the rest of the time we were there. She was pleasant and even made little conversation with us. She constantly checked on us  and even recommended some things for us to try. She kept forgetting our some of our orders though. I'm not sure if it's her or whoever is making them in the back that kept making the mistake. That's mainly the reason for the one star deduction.   I would personally recommend their no rice rolls so you can save some room for other things. Rice can be overwhelming when eating AYCE so my best tip is to avoid them unless you're eating it with the Nigiri, which we got a lot of. The fishes were fresh and delicious. Ordered the salmon, yellowtail, Cajun albacore, garlic tuna Nigiri. My friend ordered a spicy tuna hand roll and a side of spicy mayo sauce and basically ate multiple of those all night.   Overall good service. The chefs could be a little faster with our orders though considering there was no one else there.   Also, they were fixing their lights during business hours. The lights kept going on and off which bothered me.  Will be back! I'm the food was good, everything else needed improvement.",

The quality of the fish was really good and this is being compared to an sushi I have had in Hawaii and California. I came here with group of 7, all of us AYCE, and Gia our server was very attentive, to our table and provided phenomenal customer service! She is one of the best servers I have ever had! It was real honor to have her as our server.  Unfortunately, the reason for the 3-stars is because the customer service in the last half of my group's time here was terrible. From my understanding Gia went on break, and Victoria was covering for her. With Victoria I had requested more ginger near the beginning of our time here, I never received it. We had also put in 3rd order for some muscles with Victoria, and unfortunately we waited close to 30-45 minutes to hear anything about them, when our previous first 2 orders came fast.. When we brought it up to her, we just asked her to cancel those muscles. She was polite to let us know she'll check up on those muscles, and if they were started then she'll bring them out, but if the chefs didn't start them then she would tell not to make them. I am not trying to pin everything Victoria, there was a clear misunderstanding going around. I am assuming Gia was the manager based on how smoothly things went when she was on the restaurant floor. When she left, things did not go as smoothly.  We came here on a Wednesday night, restaurant was nearly empty. If the customer service was consistently as smooth as it was when Gia was helping my group, I would have given this place 5 stars.",

The Choo Choo special and threesome special are no longer options. The rolls have changed names and the menu is now very similar to that of Sushi Loca with the same names of \"tastes like your ex-girlfriend\" and \"I love my ass\" rolls. The service is still top notch and the variety of fresh fish is abundant. The fried baby octopuses are soooo good! This is definitely one of my fave ayce sushi places in town.",

I had the opportunity to celebrate a friend's birthday here, and truly had a blast. As it turns out, they have separate, private karaoke rooms were groups of 6 or more can have their private gatherings and enjoy some bomb food. Best part? They had no issues charging us separately for our convenience. A BIG plus there.  So why 5 starts? Here is why:  * Service: GREAT! The servers were incredibly efficient and were constantly checking up on us. Despite being almost 30 of us, the two servers were calm, collected, and ALWAYS had a smile on their face. I felt welcomed and catered to, the entire evening.  * Food- Delicious and fresh. The rolls for the AYCE are a bit small, but I actually like that because I was able to try a variety of different rolls and flavors. Every single dish I tried was yummy and had a distinct flavor profile  * Speed- I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the food arriving within minutes of everyone ordering. The food arrived beautifully presented, so despite the large amount of orders, the kitchen did NOT get sloppy. Kudos to the entire team.  * Accuracy- This is where the miss the mark a little bit. A few of us were missing some of the dishes we ordered, and some of the food that was supposed to be hot (like my shrimp tempura) was more on the warm side. However, given the size of the party, this was NOT the end of the world. Despite missing a couple of items I ordered, the awesome food and service more than made up for it. I was originally going to take away one star for this, but that would be too harsh.  Anywyas, I hope you enjoy your visit to JJanga!",

The uni wasn't fishy or an overpowering taste of iodine either, it was a great sea urchin roe, also the oyster was a decent size and was paired with a nice neutralizing sauce. I really loved the no rice rolls, it was a fresh change from the usual heavy, but fluffy and still besutiful, Japanese Sushi rice.   There were also a few things that my family and the only thing that we would've liked to see was a little more contrast in the creamy sauces. It was a bit much for some of the rolls. Perhaps a squeeze of lemon would change that?  But besides that one bit, the staff were very kind and atentative. Plus the resturaunt's enviroment is very unique and cool. I would come again for sure!",

The atmosphere is set for you to relax and enjoy time with your friends while you have no choice but to listen to Asian (mostly Korean) music play throughout the restaurant.   Come hungry since they do offer AYCE for a great lunch price of $20.95. The variety of rolls are good, and the seafood quality is good, but I always look forward to their Chef Specials. Just let them know what fish you enjoy the most and they will prep something up for ya. What I could not get tired of was their Oysters! They are prepared perfectly with a kick  Unfortunately they have a one time order (3 per person).  Another favorite of mine to look forward to is the Grapefruit Sake! There will be a party the day I No worries on paying extra for it since it comes with your AYCE. Personally I am not a fan of grapefruit, although it really compliments the sake itself.  Big thanks to Hickey for getting me a hickey that one night.. nahh, those days are over. He sure can make one hell of a salmon special though. To Jjanga himself, you are appreciated for hosting me and my Yelp buddies, as well as preparing us a birthday ice cream dish.   I would have to say that the biggest problem is usually making contact with the servers. Like many other places that I have been to (which is why I cant complain much), they seem to act def at times.  JJANGA is definitely on my top 5 for AYCE sushi and I plan to visit many more times.",

We did order some appetizers and rolls like usual. Let me remember um sorry they let me down so I did not want to take any photos i hope you understand when you bring your beloved to a place and it's really bad, those were Spicy garlic Edamame, Baked mussels, dynamite, Shrimp tempura, Agedashi tofu, Spicy wing and House salad, The Bomb and Dancing Tiger. Yes, one word Spicy. If you are a fan of spicy, most of the rolls here are for you, congrats! If you are not, like us, sorry go home please. Spicy wings, no spicy, but raw. My major is restaurant management so I know and I learn how to cook, I used to work at a fried chicken brand, I know how difficult to cook chicken, it needs time and really high temperature, so whenever we order chicken, I have to check inside very carefully. That's why, I knew it's still raw, red and wet. They changed another plate, but it's not tasty though. When it comes to eel sauce, yass it's heaven but here, you'll change your mind. I wonder if they know how to make it, it tasted like soy sauce and sugar, or i dont know how to enjoy the real real real one??? Service was slow, when we wanted to order more, server was busy to talk together.",

I really hated the taste and they put way to much cream cheese on their roll it was nauseating. Would not recommend at all. Spend your money somewhere else.

I seen this place via Facebook and should have check yelp before even visiting. I have a sever allergy to avocado and told Erick NO avocado anywhere on any plate served. I heard Erick tell the chefs avocado allergy. After one of the chefs kept staring at me. So naturally that right away made me feel awkward and uncomfortable. But I let it go. After almost 30 minutes (They were no where near busy, there were 4 other occupied tables other than mine) they gave me an order and my friend luckily seen the avocado in the roll. I assumed there was none because again, I heard Erick tell them no avocado. They wanted to remake my food but I refused and left. Never again. But thanks Erick for doing your job!",

We had one server, a younger gal who I didn't get to see the name of, but she was really attentive and one thing I like is when the server will come up to you and ASK if you'd like to order more.  The bus person also came frequently, to take everyone's finished plates out of the way.  And the quality of the sushi was very up to par,  adding also that our orders came pretty quickly!  We ate so much that our last roll had 2-3 pieces left and we had it sitting on the table for a bit worrying about being charged extra because we were way too full to finish it all haha, and she was kind enough to take it away and ask if we wanted any dessert before receiving the bill. Very nice service!  Only downfall in comparison to my favorite sushi spot is the fish to rice ratio (the reason for my 4/5 star rating). Just felt like the rice was a bit on the 'massier' side, but overall 9.5/10 rating!   ----Overall---- Service 10/10 Food 10/10  Thanks Jjanga!",

We chose to do the a la Carter menu as opposed to the all you can eat because we weren't that hungry.  The main reason I gave 3 stars is because the menu options here are very limited. The choices are raw fish, sushi, raw fish, and well, sushi. For a name that includes \"Japanese restaurant\" my boyfriend was hoping for some steak or shrimp skewer options like most places have.   As far as the all you can eat sushi goes (which I had on my first visit) it is really nothing special. The sushi is good and fresh, but nothing to write home about. I can name about three other places that have a better all you can eat options for a better price and with more variety.  The food we did order, edamame, two carpaccios, and two rolls, were very good and tasted fresh. The server was also very generous with the ginger which I love.  Overall, I may return to this restaurant at some point, but I'd recommend checking out other all you can eat options in Vegas as they are plentiful.",

Actually, we came here twice during our short visit to Las Vegas for sushi based off a raving recommendation from a local who I trust and I have to agree that this is the top dog sushi establishment in Las Vegas and a must visit in my book from now on whenever I come to Vegas.  Excellent quality, fantastic value, and a dining experience that will leave you with wonderful memories.  *Visualize homer drooling.  Parking is plentiful, and this restaurant is easy to find.  The dinner menu and lunch menu are similarly priced so I would suggest you go with the dinner menu since it comes with some premium items that are oppa gangnam style quality and delicious and will most likely make you a fan.  Located a few minutes away from the strip (I don't recommend trying to walk here from the strip though), i will repeat my sentiment that this is THE place to come for delicious all you can eat sushi.  Their hot tea was also nice and their dessert ice cream were good as well  Most of the waiters were cool with exception to one that my  wife didn't like very much.  They all speak English here so don't feel intimidated.  Only down side I can think of for this place is (thinking long and hard for a negative)... Well, I heard they can get really busy so this can lead to a wait for food and seats.  Otherwise a-ok USA!  4.000000000001777 stars rounded down make this one a super saiyan solid 4 glowing Yelp stars in my book.  Thank you Jjanga and keep up the good work. Have a positive day.",

I usually order multiple orders of their super white because it just melts in your mouth. My favorite roll would be the Kiss of Fire. The service is fast and you get your food in a timely manner. Their sushi rice is a hit or miss sometimes cause it'll fall apart at times when dipping it into the soy sauce but not the worst first world problem. After you've stuffed yourself with enough sushi, if there's room left in your stomach they do offer mochi ice cream or just ice cream for dessert. I typically go for their green tea ice cream because it's my favorite. I love this place and it's my go-to spot when the sushi cravings kick in! Enjoy :)",

The place was almost empty during prime lunch hour. It's located in a weird unsuspecting strip mall, which has a billiards place we used to visit in our dating days. Oh, the memories of our young love! Anyway...  Le sigh. Our rolls, even the hand rolls, were falling apart. The fish tasted a bit off- the salmon wasn't rich and buttery. I asked for a veggie roll, even clarified twice after he asked, and still got a veggie tempura. Everything was covered in sauce, especially eel sauce, even though there was no mention of it in the description. Normally, sushi spots are very good about listing everything in and on the roll. All of the rolls we ordered tasted the same, oddly enough. The Naruto roll was filled with so much imitation crab and so little of the other fillings that were supposed to be in it that I had to force myself to eat it. And right after that is when we left.   The hostess and waitresses were so sweet though. And our ice teas were also delicious.  Unsatisfactory- this is what I get for cheating on Umiya.",

I'll definitely be returning as the prices are reasonable and the fish tasted great. It's rare that I walk over to the bar to thank the sushi chefs. A great environment and decor :)",

We were a group of 14 at 11pm at night and the restaurant was almost empty on a Friday night; that shouldn't been our first indication but we had kids with us and everyone was hungry.   We were seated promptly and about 5 of us decided on AYCE. The AYCE menu is so limited, most of what you can order are rolls and nagiri. The rolls are huge portions and they don't offer half orders. Most AYCE sushi places offer half orders and include more choices (meat options, soup options, etc)   The flavor of their rolls were mostly sour. My husband ordered the 4 rolls that people can order only once and all 4 of them had some sort of sour component either lemon infused or powdered with something tasting like tajin- which in Japanese is not something one expects.   For the price and the limited options, people are better off looking at other places on spring mountain.   The upside- the service was great (I mean 3 chefs and 4 waiters for 18 ppl ratio)and  the fish was fresh.   Probably wouldn't come back with all the options on spring mountain.",

I don't recommend going here unless you want to feel like you are inconveniencing the staff.   I've never wrote a yelp review before but the owners of this place need to know that their staff is rude and running money out the front door.     At least they could have offered us a seat at the dead bar or an empty table for drinks while we waited.   Until management starts to care about their customers DONT GO!",

You know the age old concept of it is has less calories, you can consume more of it?  Well, apparently I think because it is cheaper, I can buy more of it, as I find myself here embarrassingly often. I have yet to dine in, but regularly get to-go orders.  I try to limit my take-out orders here to once a month, but it isn't easy.  It's not Soho or even Sushi Koma, but I recommend it for good, affordable sushi.  Also, service is great and every roll we have tried is very good.

I read some other reviews and I was excited about the place the we all know the customer service and kill it for all of us. I give them another shot cuz the food was that good.

They have an excellent AYCE - All You Can Eat - selection and they are not stingy with it. You can order as much as you want. They say the Salmon Belly nigiri is limited, but you can easily order three pieces per person without them saying anything. The best part about this place is their epic hand rolls. The Lisa Hand Roll and the Jjanga burrito is very unique.   The Lisa Hand roll comes with fried tempura, spicy tuna, crab, and avocado. Add a hint of soy sauce and wasabi and you have yourself one of the best hand rolls ever made in town! The Jjanga burrito is wrapped with soy paper, crab meat, green onion, and shrimp fried rice inside. This can be eaten with soy sauce or alone. it is all based on your preference.   The nigiri pieces are decent. The rice to sushi ratio is reasonable. They are not too strict, but will encourage you to take it slowly. However, they can keep up with you if you decide to order a lot. I recommend coming here not during rush hour because this place gets pretty packed on the weekends, during lunch, and dinner time! It is an awesome place to Karaoke as well. There are limited rooms, but you can request it, eat sushi, drink, and sing your heart out with your friends! Also, get an order of the chicken wings. They are really good. They take awhile to make so order it early and let it cool down when it gets to your table. You don't want to burn your tongue!   The seating is okay. Sometimes it is a bit uncomfortable when you have to sit in a booth and the table is too far away from the booth seat. So I recommend getting seated somewhere you can have control of the table and actually move it closer to you. I recommend coming here on an empty stomach since it is all you can eat. You want to make sure you get your money's worth.   Remember, the service is not the best. The Ft. Apache location I experienced better service at. Sometimes these people have a language barrier and it gets super busy so they can become overwhelmed quickly. You will need to be patient and enjoy the company of great people as you wait for your server to come. There is always Japenese pop music playing in the background, which is always fun to listen to while you eat.  Try to different fruit sake. They will not get you too tipsy, but they are tasty to drink. For desert, I recommend you try the vanilla ice cream. Yes, it seems plain, but it really is THAT good.",

The food itself comes out to about $30 after tax per person.  They have a bunch of rolls and sushi to choose from.  They separate their rolls in categories such as shrimp tempura based rolls and no rice rolls.  There are a few items where they limit one order per person, such as Uni, sweet shrimp, and a handful of other items.   The rice to fish ratio is just OK here.  There are other places that give you more fish though.  Parking is in a strip mall.  Not really an issue. The 3 stars is relative to other AYCE sushi joints in vegas.  WIth that said, if this were in LA, it would be 5 stars for sure.",

The appetizers were also to die for, I personally loved their dynamite and vegetable tempura.  My only regret is not trying any rolls tonight, but I definitely had my fill of everything else.

Their garlic tuna sashimi is amazing and I really could come here JUST FOR THAT.  The menu is packed with lots of options for appetizers that are amazing, try the pork mini skewer, it's pork belly & amazing!! Poke is great as welll!

They gave us our own room, so I didn't really get a glimpse of the entire restaurant.  The food was absolutely amazing. One of my friends was even able to order only broccoli tempura. The staff was really nice and would come in occasionally to make sure everything was alright. They did forget about one or two of our orders, but they really made up for it all in service.   This is definitely my new favorite sushi place!",

    "text": "Now I don't normally deduct stars from a restaurant based solely on horrible service because lets face it--- it's usually a hit or miss when it comes to getting a good/bad server. I don't believe good service necessarily reflects on the overall quality of food in a restaurant, which is ultimately what truly matters. However, my experience at JJanga this past weekend was SO horrible that I had to deduct a star from its otherwise 4 star rating...  TO JJANGA MANAGEMENT: FIND YOURSELF BETTER SERVERS THAT KNOW HOW TO BE POLITE TO GUESTS, NOT RUDE!   It was my birthday and I went with my boyfriend around 4:30PM to celebrate.The restaurant wasn't busy at this time but because there was only one sushi chef working, our food took about 15-20 minutes to come out PER DISH, ITEM BY ITEM. Since the AYCE portions were very small, we finished each dish within a few minutes and had to wait another 15-20 minutes for the next dish. It was very annoying to have such a long wait time in between dishes, especially since everything was bite size. The girl that served us had a serious staring problem. I'm not the type of person to make assumptions about someone I don't know, but I swear the way she full on stared/glared at me while taking my order made me feel like she was inspecting every pore and blemish on my face. It was beyond uncomfortable and made me feel like she was judging me on a personal level, instead of being a professional server. Never once did she smile or speak a full sentence to me. She was so unwelcoming that I actually felt awkward and hesitant to order from her. To make matters worse, she only made direct eye contact with my boyfriend. At one point, my normally unobservant boyfriend even made a comment to me about her staring issues. When she did speak, I noticed that she wasn't fluent in English, which is completely fine. But seriously? As a server you should at least have some type of communication skill. Being shy and non-responsive is NOT the right attitude for the hospitality industry. How hard was it to just happily take an order? It wasn't like we were complaining about her service then and there. We walked in and immediately she eyed me up and down like I was some B*** she wanted to cat fight at the club -_-. I've had bad service before but never downright rude service like this.  That aside, when the food did mange to come out most items were decent. The quality of fish was fresh albeit the portion was extremely small, even for AYCE sizes. We're talking about 1 piece of agedashi tofu, 2 pieces of gyoza, 2 pieces of fried scallops, etc.. all of that equate to literally 2 bites for each portion. As employees of Japanese restaurants on and off the strip, we were very annoyed with the way the sushi chef made the nigiris. The rice kept falling apart when we tried to pick it up. It was so poorly made that the rice would crumble into the soy sauce dish, causing us to eat the fish separate from the rice that was drench inside of soy sauce. Anyone that is a sushi chef or works in an upscale Japanese restaurant can tell you, crumbling rice is a big no no.   Overall, this was my second time dining at JJanga. The first time was during their grand opening. I remember service being poor back then as well, but I figured it was because they had just opened and were training their servers. Sadly, the second time around after this establishment has expanded to two locations, I realize that nothing has improved.   Most likely I won't be going back any time soon.",

Last call is at 11 don't go within the last few hours of closing because it'll be really bad customer service. We went around 10:45 and we didn't get anyone to take or orders, got no straws, and the waiter was rushing us and he even spilled our water and didn't bother to clean it up. They messed up our orders and tried to bring us more rolls than we asked, and when we asked for straws the waiter gave us attitude about it and handed us one single straw when both of us needed them. Our waiter was a talker asian guy with big square glasses, on the chubbier side. I wouldn't recommend this place anymore. Definitely better places in town with a lot better customer service. When we wanted to pay we waited for a long time for someone to take our check because all the employees were too busy focusing on closing. We've been coming to this location for years and this new management just isn't cutting it for us. Not worth the money anymore.",

He also later made us an interesting tuna carpaccio type situation which again was quite tasty. Overall I was quite impressed. Particularly with the quality of their fish which I actually favored over my old favorite. I will be going back.  The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the Ecstasy Roll at Goyemon is my favorite roll anywhere & they had nothing comparable.

Despite all of the good restaurants available, I feel comfortable saying that JJanga is easily my favorite AYCE spot.    As far as Nigiri goes, I usually go with the smoked salmon, white tuna, and yuzu yellowtail, which are all excellent.  The appetizer section is the most extensive one I've seen, as is the menu of sushi rolls.  There are so many excellent things to choose from, that you may have trouble deciding.    I usually find myself eating sushi late at night, after hours of playing poker on the strip.  Jjanga has a perfectly timed happy hour at 11pm (you can order off of the lunch menu for $21) which I take advantage of 2-3 times a week lately.    I would also recommend sitting up at the sushi bar, as the sushi chefs are all very friendly, and get your food to you in a hurry.  Also, on my last visit, one of the chefs, Choo Choo, whipped up a few special creations for me that were not on the menu.",

I was debating on here or another location as I prefer to not order off a menu but again well worth it. We ordered a variety of nigiri, rolls, and salads. I like the fact that they have a number of rolls that have no rice but the bummer is a bunch of those rolls have tempura in them which I dont like. HOwever, everything else was fresh. They are FAST too. Only downside is the portions are very small in comparison to a regular sushi roll but that's how they portion control i guess.   If I go back to Vegas, will def go back to visit.",

Everything I tried was amazing with the exception of the yum yum sauce which tasted like straight up mayo egh! The reason I gave 4 stars is because the service was horrible. They would forget to bring items we ordered or they wouldn't come check on us to see if we wanted to order more. That was very frustrating, but luckily they weren't strict on the 45 minute lunch time limit. Overall great sushi with horrible service.",

I was so sick all night after having the crazy ass deep fried roll and the Japanese lasagna. I only tried those based on the reviews I read.  Makes me wonder if these reviewers were paid to rave about them.  I left my scarf behind accidently and I called them to confirm and put it aside. They didn't even look for it and told me they did not find it.  Such disrespect and disregard is unfathomable. This is no way to treat people who give you business.

There are endless choices on sushi rolls, like baked rolls, no rice rolls, fried rolls, appetizers, etc. They even have a punch card for each time you go! Highly recommend.

Almost every customer that walks through the door is recognized/welcomed back by one the of the staff.  Koo Koo and Jjanga have been absolute standouts for my roommate and I.

If you go try the grapefruit saki. I don't like grapefruit or saki and it was very good. It left me wishing we could take this place home with us.

The fish was definitely fresh and delicious and the service was excellent. We had several workers check in on us repeatedly to be sure we weren't overlooked. I think a more organized waiting system may help them in the long run so that customers aren't asked the same questions repeatedly though! We had to tell servers that we had already placed an order pretty often. We did visit during peak hours so that may be the reason for the extra care they took to be attentive so no one was overlooked though. Our food was superb from appetizer to desert with a good balance between rice and fish throughout. The portions were also excellent to allow for a wider selection before getting full. We were both very pleased with our first visit here and will likely come again, next time for the karaoke!",

It's very interesting and I love it. My friend and I both got two rolls to ourselves (playboy special, kiss me roll, double d, and the Washington roll) one to split (tuna naruto) two special things the chefs made us, an order of the baby octopus, and two orders of mango mochi.  Everything was delish. I left very full, but not gross full of like some other sushi places leave you feeling. They don't overload and swim their stuff in sauce and overload with rice, it's all just perfection.  This is the best place I've found so far, nothing I've ever had was bad. I love me a choo choo special! ;)",

I'd call thought of you're interested before you go down.  We went here because they have an all you can eat option for $26. Which is a really good deal, you can choose anything on the menu.  I'm not an all you can eat kind of girl, so they also had an ala carte option. I ordered the spicy scallop and crab roll, eight pieces for only $3! And the roll was spicy, normally things aren't when they say they are, so I was very happy that they weren't lying. I normally use sriracha like ketchup, which is about a 2 for me. This roll would have been a 7. I also ordered their kabocha soup. This was surprisingly sweet, but not overly sweet. I liked the consistency as well, loose with a little grit.  The service as interesting. I believe that everyone is pooling, so everyone helps everyone. But at times this seemed like it causes confusion because they didn't communicate with each other. Everyone was friendly which is good. At times I felt like they didn't understand what we wanted, but I'm not sure why. The restaurant itself is cute. Asian designs. Nothing to complain about. I noticed they also had karaoke rooms available, but I'm not sure how they work.  I'd love to go back here to try more items in their menu.",

It took me 15min just to read the entire menu.  All the rolls were creative and delicious. Pretty much every combination you can think of was on there which is awesome. For instance, I hate cucumbers in my rolls, but instead of having to ask them to hold the cucumber, they have a whole selection of rolls without it already.  Also they don't overload their rolls with rice like other AYCE places do.   The nigiri was thick and fresh. Appetizers were all pretty good. The only thing I didn't enjoy, was the house salad, but whatever. Who besides me goes to AYCE and gets salad anyways?!?  Service was fairly attentive. We had a part of 10, so I understand it can get overwhelming with all the orders and reorders coming at you constantly, but they had 2 girls waiting on us and a busboy as well and they just weren't refilling or clearing the empties as well as they could.   But honestly, that's the worst of the review. So do yourself a favor and try this place out. You won't regret it, and if you do, it'll be because you regret stuffing yourself so full!",

I get it with no crab (because I'm allergic) and I add cream cheese. It's so good!!! Another thing I really like is the calamari. 5 stars for Jjanga because the service is as great as the the food!",

    "text": "I was looking for a sushi buffet and I came across Jjanga. Reviews and pictures looked good so we made the trek out here. It's not too far from the strip if you have a car. It's located in a janky plaza, but the inside is decorated like a fancy establishment - the kind that you would find on the strip. Jazzy atmosphere here and the service is excellent.   The manager greeted us and would walk around to make sure everything was running smoothly. We did have a dedicated waitress but everyone pitched in to make sure our drinks were filled and our table was never bare. Great service!   Dinner was $25.95 per person.   The sushi was pretty fresh and the chefs are creative. Here are some of my favorites:  + Crazy Ass + Monkey Burrito + Jackpot Special + Nigiri!!   I can't believe they had uni on their AYCE! Wow~ My only issue for it not being 5 star is that when we asked them to recommend stuff they recommended stuff we ended up not liking. They recommended the Jjanga Special, and the Something Wrong #69. When my hubs tried the first piece he was like \"something's wrong\" and almost spit out his food. So I would be careful about taking their recommendations.   For most of the meal I stuck to just getting nigiri. We also tried their mochi and ice cream. Not sure where they're getting their ice cream. It tasted slightly different. Not bad, just different.",

He told us the wait time was 25 minutes and it ended up being about 45. I had to go ask him how much longer instead of him coming over and  keeping us updated.  After looking over the menu, I noticed it was very Americanized, contained a lot of cream cheese and imitation crab so I was not excited to try the food. 3 of the people at my table got the AYCE and me and my other friend decided to go al a carte. We started off by ordering the pumpkin soup and cucumber salad to see what type of food we were dealing with. The pumpkin soup came out luke warm and had no flavor. The cucumber salad was cut sloppily and did not taste fresh. We decided to pass on the rest of the food.",

This would be a good spot for group dates and families.  It was the first time I went into a restaurant that had a pirate chest with complimentary toys for kids.  How sweet!  This grown up joint definitely caters to the little one's needs, complete with a panda face bento box and st. Patrick's day green utensils.  The service is also very accommodating and friendly.  The food was great, but we did experience a discrepancy between sushi orders.  Some were cut beautifully and some were kinda butchered (I didn't take photos of our salmon nigiri and the follow up orders because they looked bad).  There were 2 sushi chefs at the counter that day and I'm not sure if the bad ones all came from 1 guy, but I do hope when you eat here you don't experience this.  We were bummed that super white tuna sushi isn't available on a regular basis but their fish cuts were substantial in ratio to the rice and quite fresh.  The rolls are large and you cannot order half rolls, but the rice doesn't drown out the other ingredients.  Their bbq chiken appetizer was very tender and tasty and the other item that we thoroughly enjoyed was the Freshmen no rice roll.  It had tuna, salmon, avocado and crab wrapped in rice paper and drizzled with a ginger sauce.  It was very light and refreshing!  Even my husband really loved this!  This is something I haven't seen anywhere yet and it was lovely.    It is a tall order to be pitched against Goyemon, Sushi Koma, Blue Fin and the many AYCE sushi options in vegas and I'm not quite sure if their nigiri necessarily equals in quality, but the vibe of the place, the friendly service and the inventiveness of their menu definitely warrants a visit.  I will be rooting for this place to keep up the good work.",

At night I had hard time finding the restaurant it was hidden in a little plaza, the sign was hard to see it was in a dark blue neon sign.  I walked in on a Tuesday night around 8:30pm for dinner the price $25.99 for all you can eat. I sat at the sushi bar in front of sushi chef choo choo who was the head sushi chef . He provided me with good service. The waitresses only checked on me for initial order of drinks. Over all hot food service was ok. It's about the same service I have received at most all you can eat sushi bars in Vegas.  Now the food, I always go for nigiri rather than rolls to try the fish out. I find the fish to rice ratio to be okay , a little on the too much rice side. Another thing no half rolls which I wish they did. The fish was fresh overall, only one uni, sweet shrimp and one beef tataki nigiri allowed during dinner only. The appetizers pretty standard as most sushi bars. I found the freshman roll which has no rice are with rice paper and cowboy roll was good and I recommend. The tuna poke was spicy. Dinner for one with order of ice tea was $31 plus tip $40. $5 to sushi chef and rest to table waitress.",

Definitely the place in Vegas for modern sushi. Service was exceptional. Prices for a la carte was really good. Two of us ate to fill for $45. Definitely coming back!",

I asked the server which is their most popular roll and he responds \"Can't you see we have millions of rolls?\" Seriously? Going back to sushi KAYA as my go to AYCE sushi place. KAYA ALWAYS HAS A WAIT but its so worth it. JJanga is a dump. Gross...... negative -10",

    "text": "The banners of the sushi chefs at the sushi counter are the sole reason why I will be back! Sitting at the sushi bar is the only way to go! Jjanga and our chef Hickey were a riot.    We usually order nigiri and a few appetizers and stay away from the rolls so if you're a roll fan look for other peoples reviews.  For an AYCE joint, the sushi was pretty Damm good.  Amaebi was fresh, not dried out like you'll find at most others.  The beef tataki was good as was the yellowtail with yuZu. I probably had the best AYCE salmon skin hand roll- it was so good Hickey made me two!  I've stayed away from AYCE for maybe 5-6 months as I've been spoiled paying 2.5X for fresh fish but for the price and definitely the service and atmosphere you can't go wrong with Jjanga.  Sit at the bar and you'll have a great time!",

    "text": "Stopped by for lunch on a recent trip, and sat at the sushi bar for the AYCE  Very impressed with the freshness, the speed of service, and the variety offered for the AYCE.  Tried a couple of the no rice rolls, the cucumber wrap made it difficult for the roll to hold together, but the freshness and crisp nature really went well with the other flavors in the rolls.  Though I saw 4 sushi chefs at the bar when I came in, Sponge was doing almost all the preparation, that might slow things down a bit on a real busy day, but for the most part I was getting plates before the prior plate was finished  Definitely a place I will try to get back to on my next trip out",
