    "text": "I can say that this place was a delightful experience. Came out to Vegas for a weekend with my ladies to celebrate a birthday, this place was the groups must have spot. We had made reservations for 8:30pm on a Saturday night before our late night shenanigans at Light.   As soon as we enter, greeted by the hostess, taken to our table. We then met our waiter, James (he reminds me of an Asian version of the actor Terrence Howard). James was super sweet, charming, he told us the story of the Resturant.... It's owned by Bobby Flay, they are known for their margaritas, lobster tacos, shrimp tamales, lamb and pork entrees. I told him that my friend Viet Pham beat Bobby Flay on Iron Chef! He just smiled and recommended we start with a round of the house margaritas. Those drinks were definitely on point! Not too sweet, tart & strong- loveee! They provide a yummy assortment of bread in a basket, the best was the jalapeno cornbread muffin, the girls devoured them! James came by to check on us and was so kind to bring us more. I'm in love with the service James provided, he was knowledgable, gave great suggestions, was very direct and efficient - he knew how to handle a table of women! We all ordered the lobster tacos, shrimp tamales and had a side of grilled corn & twice baked potato. Everything was light, flavorful and delicious. We ordered another round of drinks! By this time we were craving something sweet! James recommended the banana pudding - my pick! The birthday girl didn't fancy banana pudding so she picked coconut cake to share with the table. James saw my sad face :( and he brought me a banana pudding anyways on him! Loveee him!! Lol. At the end of our meal, he brought out our check and 4 to-go cups to take our margaritas with us - to keep our party going. I love his thoughtfulness and his service is by far the BEST I have ever seen.   Thank you James for your amazing service! Next time I'm in Vegas, I'm dining at Mesa Grill for sure. See our pic!",

Ordered the amazing lobster taco appetizer, the green peppercorn tuna steak (lots of whole yet soft peppercorns), rabbit, carrot cake ice cream sandwich with pineapple caramel sauce, and the butterscotch cake. All were AMAZING!!! I'll definitely come here again next time we're in Vegas.",

    "text": "One of my favorite chefs is Bobby Flay.  While he may be a bit overexposed with the multitude of TV shows he appears on, the guy knows how to cook and does Southwest cuisine like a frickin' culinary Einstein.  Best yet, his cookbooks have recipes that are exceedingly accessible for the home cook and if followed with reasonable precision, you end up with damn tasty results.  Therefore, it was a no-brainer for the GF and me to go for lunch at the Vegas version of his Mesa Grill.    It was a Friday at the beginning of lunchtime.  Mesa Grill was empty and we could've sat at any table we wanted, but we decided to sit at the bar.  The bar is dominated by a heady array of fine tequilas and whisky.  Given it was before noon, we elected to just have water and some coffee.  Arturo, our bartender/server was friendly and spot on with his service.  We opened with an order of Rough Cut Tuna \"Nachos\" served with mango, habanero hot sauce and avocado crema.  The \"nachos\" were exactly as advertised, a Southwest-style ceviche with a great balance of sweet and spicy hot with an avocado creaminess.  For my lunch course, I had the Cornmeal Crusted Chile Relleno stuffed with eggplant, manchego cheese, red pepper sauce and balsamic vinegar.  The Chile Relleno was perfectly fried, crispy on the outside, tender chile with gooey cheesiness on the inside, and surprisingly light all-around.  It was perfect!  The GF had the Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash.  I liked my dish better.    Mesa Grill is an unpretentious place.  It does simple, very pleasing food.  While it may not be the finest restaurant in Las Vegas, I can't name that many that provide a more enjoyable dining experience...especially for lunch!",

    "text": "Ok, If you are in Las Vegas, please make it a priority to visit Mesa Grill! I am SO happy I decided to come here. Pro tip: MAKE A RESERVATION. At least a few days in advance, too. The place is jumping, and without a reservation you probably won't get a table. Anyway...My boyfriend and I had the cactus pear margaritas (They don't have them on the menu, but ask your server about the specialty margs and this will be one of them). They were amaaaaazing!!!! For starters, I got the baby Romaine salad, which was so so so good. I loved the parmesan crouton type things so much that my server surprised me with an entire plate of them!!! is it healthy to eat an entire plate of fried cheese? Probably not....but who cares because it f*cking ROCKED!!! Then, I got the ancho chile honey glazed salmon, and my boyfriend had the seared tuna. Both were outstanding, perfectly cooked (nothing worse than well done salmon), and beautifully plated! Unfortunately had no room for dessert, but it's my mission to get some the next time i'm in town! Which, might possibly be for this restaurant alone..",

    "text": "As some people know, I'm not Bobby Flay's biggest fan. I find him to be an arrogant jerk, something I'm sure he's heard before so I don't particularly feel bad about saying it. We went to Mesa Grill.   I know he's supposed to be known for his burgers and what not, so I ordered the Mesa burger, which came with seasoned fries. They bring a basket of bread to your table as you sit down, there's raisin bread, jalepeno bread and corn bread. I've been having a corn bread craving for a while and his was jam packed with jalepenos and corn, which is nice, but it lacked that buttery good moistness I'm used to in cornbread. The regular Jalepeno bread was yummy. I even tried the raisin bread even though I don't particularly care for raisins, it was good, nothing outstanding.   Finally my burger came. And I was excited. The fries looked well seasoned, only to find out that they're really well seasoned in the middle of the bowl but as you moved outwards it became blander. And there was no salt and pepper on the table, I understand the reasoning that if it's cooked well you don't need salt and pepper. But I kind of needed salt and pepper.  The fries were crisp and had a great crunch. The burger itself was very juicy. Cheese, onions, spicy mustard on the side, ketchup also on the side, trying to get the condiments in was a hassle so I ended up dipping smaller pieces. Overall, good burger, hearty, filling, comforting. Can I get a better one for less than 16$, Absolutely.   HOWEVER, I will absolutely give Bobby this, that his staff is fantastically trained. Our waiter went out of his way to take pictures of our table for us, going up to the rotisserie, taking pictures from the level above us, etc. It was very nice of him, he even offered us a free cappuccino after finding out we're college students (thus probably weren't going to order it anyway because of funds). He took really good care of us throughout our meal. So good job there, Bobby but might want to have a look see at your food",

    "text": "I actually proposed to my g/f about 15 minutes before our 8PM reservation in our MGM Sky Loft which meant we were celebrating at Mesa Grill.  To start off we had a mojito, margarita, and the chicken tacos appetizer. The 2 drinks were excellent. Im not a mojito fan but this was drinkable and stiff. The margarita really hit the spot and was overly full of tequila which is my style of drink! THe chicen tacos were awesome, 3 little breasts on skewers that came with 3 small tortillas, glazed onions, and a bbq sauce of some kind. A great way to start off!  For our entree we ordered the coffee rubbed filet and I had the salmon. THe filet was cooked to perfections with loads of flavor and looked like a masterpiece on the plate. The salmon was just as perfect, cooked exactly how I like (mid rare) with a great crisp crust on the top and bottom from a good sear.   We also had a la carte chille relleno and twice baked potatoe. Nothing too crazy but needed something on the side besides just the entree. The chile relleno was different with a hard corn meal like crust with bean/corn mash textured filling. Was different but good. The twice baked potatoe was better than a normal one.  Dessert we didnt really want but we had to do it just to do it! We had the churros which we were glad we ordered. Hot and cripsy on the outside and warm and gooey on the inside. To top it off it came with a chocolate sauce to dip the churros in.   Overall this was a top notch resturaunt with top notch service. One thing my g/f pointed out that was over the top was the fact she was wearing a black dress, she was initially given a white napkin and then the waitress came back and swapped her napkin with a black one. Now thats paying attention to detail.",

After the watching the Celine Dion Concert, we were both starving and my Mom wanted to eat something right away close to the Coliseum and I told her about Mesa Grill which was owned by Celeb Chef Bobby Flay. They say, sometimes he'll be working behind the grill but unfortunately he wasn't there.   ='(  But that didn't stop me from enjoying my dinner with Mum, the place is hip and modern just like the rest of Caesars Palace's restaurants and they don't have a strict dress code, just casual to formal. Staff here are top notch in service and the food here is on the $$$ side but I knew that before walking in and ordering our food since there was a big menu with prices outside of the restaurant.  We ordered:  22 oz Bone in Chipotle Glazed Rib-Eye $48   -side of Mashed Potatoes + Green Chile Queso Sauce $9  Ancho Chile Honey Glazed Salmon  - Spicy Black Sauce + Roasted Jalapeno Crema  - $32  Both of the entrees were excellent and couldn't fault on anything, bone in Chipotle Glazed Rib-Eye was very tender and juicy and included two different sauces hot and mild but I forgot the names. And a side of mashed potatoes, was nothing phenomenal. My mom ordered the Ancho Chile Honey Glazed Salmon and that was a great dish.   Service here great, not excellent. Our waiter never explained the different sauces I had for my Chipotle Rib-Eye and that took it down one star. Other than that, dinner was lovely and I was glad to finally eat in Bobby Flay's Famous Mesa Grill restaurant at Caesar's Palace.  Unfortunately I didn't see Bobby Flay grilling his signature steaks in his kitchen.   Boo!",

I ordered the spicy chicken with sweet potato hash and two poached eggs and it didn't look anything like I expected it to. They were two huge meatball looking things with eggs on top and a hollandaise sauce with a weird spicy sauce on top of that. The whole concept of this dish seemed like a good idea adding in the sweet with the salty but the bites of chicken and hash were a little heavy handed. When you eat all the components together, its not a perfect blend but you just gotta play with the food a lil and find different combinations that work for you.

The flavor was too tangy and there was just a small bit of scrambled eggs and about 4 small crunchy tortillas.  The sauces were just ok, I've had killer chilaquiles from other restaurants.    The margarita was really delicious, though, I'd come back to try their steak which I heard was really tasty.",

Was greeted for lunch service by a very rude hostess who told me I needed to take off my hat before she seated me. It was a dressy fedora style hat and of course I wasn't going to sit with it on.   The attitude didn't stop there. The server got extremely short with us when we didn't order appetizers to start the meal.i ordered ham and eggs while my girlfriend had the pork sandwich. The pork was nicely seasoned but overall nothing else was really special. I ordered a coffee to finish the meal and never was offered a refill. Seriously, $4.00 for a cup of coffee. No refills.  Based solely on the poor service and attitude at Mesa Grill, I won't be returning. It's a shame because Bobby Flay ALWAYS has a smile on TV but none of his employees could even be bothered. Go elsewhere.",

My queue of pending reviews is overwhelming now, but one review at a time...  Mesa Grill is the perfect place for a delicious dinner in LV.  Both times I have dined at Mesa Grill l I have left happy and full.    Ambiance: Nice, but not stuffy.  Bright color scheme matches the lively and upbeat atmosphere.    Service: Excellent.  The staff is knowledgeable and friendly, while still maintaining the upscale, professional, vibe.    Food: Full of great flavors and textures.    Tiger shrimp w/ roasted garlic: My favorite item on the menu thus far.  The shrimp were cooked perfectly; they were tender and juicy, yet gave a little pop when you bit into them.  The garlic cream sauce was smooth and mild and just delicious with the delicate shrimp.  Goat cheese queso fundido: Goat cheese served bubbling in cast iron, need I say more?  Green chili cioppino: The flavor of the broth was fresh and the scallion butter just made the dish that much more rich and luxurious.",

Mesa since opening, is a great example of celeb chef commitment to his brand. Beyond the food our server who has been there 11 years made the experience perfect! To the point, attentive, and directive. Don't you hate it when you ask... \"What's good?\" and you get \"Everything is good\" Yeah Thanks for nothing. Our server was direct and get this, don't order that.     The lamb was over the moon, I got the fondue for my veggie friend. While as awesome as the last time, was not hot enough to dip.

They didn't just accommodate us.  They made us feel like VIP's. Service: Unbelievable.   On point recommendations and she just really just must love her job.  My wife ordered Mahi Mahi and they brought halibut instead.  As soon as they realized the error the Mahi Mahi appeared within minutes.  It was like a magic trick.  They sincerely cared about giving great service. Food: It's Bobby Flay signature TexMex so umame and nice spice.  I had a crab cake appetizer ( special, not on the usual menu) and the twice baked potato.  Kinda amazing. The crab cake was the best I've ever had. Ambience:  It was homey, friendly, and not pretentious. Price: well....yikes.  great food but it is a little on the spendy side.",

The service is always grand, give or take a waiter/waitress who is extra personable or the waiter/waitress who may just be doing their job and has no time or need for additional funnies or conversation; I would still rate it stellar. From the bread basket, house made butter, drinks, and main dishes, it is A-one! Shout out to the chef- we are fans.   Although there are more than a million restaurants to choose from in Vegas, \"Mesa Grill\" is a must try and one that we must patronize when in town. If you haven't had it, try it- hopefully it won't disappoint.   Again, #WeAreFans  Signed a total upscale food & service snob ;)",

Now when people ask me what my favorite steakhouse is, I tell them it's Bobby Flay's steakhouse in Caesars Palace.  Me and my friends were visiting Vegas for the weekend, and was looking for that ONE good meal we can all enjoy and look back upon, since it was first time in Vegas for few of us. Mesa Grill was more of an experience rather just a meal for us.   The steak (I ordered Filet Mignon) was one of the best I ever have had in my life. It was perfect. It made me forget about every other mediocre steakhouses I usually go when I am back in my hometown.. The Roasted Corn side was also amazing !!   Some may be reluctant to give this place a try from just looking at the prices on the menu, but I completely thought that it was worth every dollar.   The waiter who was serving us was also 5/5. He made sure our experience at Mesa Grill was top notch.  Thank you Mesa Grill and I will certainly be back in the future !!",

An authentically delicious Bobby Flay restaurant where the Southwestern flavors really come through in each dish, whether it's a simple spice, a sauce with a bit of kick to it, or the entire orchestration of a dish. It's pretty pricey for dinner but lunch is reasonable and a great option for trying this place otherwise. From the ancho chile-honey glazed salmon to the smoked chicken black bean quesadilla to the Mesa burger and southwestern fries, every dish was a solid choice.   Given his grilling expertise, I felt compelled to get the Mesa burger. The whole thing was pretty much perfect. A juicy burger complemented by some onions and subtle cheddar cheese where the taste of the grill showed all the way through. Then added some addicting chile bbq sauce to top it off. It's a bit messy but in the best of ways. Add some irresistible and somewhat heavily-seasoned fries and it's the real deal.",

My husband ordered the Sophie's salad, which was earthy and just okay, along with the Porterhouse Pork Chop, which was incredible to say the least. Cooked to perfection, tender and flavorful. I ordered the Roasted Corn Soup, which was a little outside of my comfort zone, but absolutely delicious and also a tad on the spicy side. I also had the sixteen spice chicken, literally the best chicken I have ever had. The dessert for both of us was the chocolate shortcake, which was tart and not exactly our favorite, but beautiful and still pretty good.   I would recommend this restaurant to anyone, and will be back next time we come to Vegas.",

It's a very colorful place and Bobby Flay's dishes are just as colorful and beautifully plated.  Rough Cut Tuna Nachos: Mango puree,  habanero hot sauce and avocado crema. Sweetness of the mango + spicy hot sauce + creamy avocado. Mmmmm...4.5/5  Tiger Shrimp and Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale:  I've been having a hard time finding good tamales in Vegas.  This is an interesting version. Perfectly cooked shrimps with a hint of garlic. 4/5  Goat Cheese Queso Fundido: Comes with blue corn chips. I love goat cheese. This queso fundido had the right amount of ooey-gooey cheesey goodness. We finished this in a few minutes. 4.5/5  Yucatan Style Grouper with Blue Crab Succotash Sauce: Nothing really exciting going on with this dish. 3/5  Mesa Burger with Southwestern Home Fries: Good and well-seasoned burger.  It has double cheddar cheese, tomatoes and caramelized onions. The fries were crisp and flavorful and comes with a horseradish mustard. 4/5  Ancho Chile-Honey Glazed Salmon:  Comes with spicy black bean  sauce and roasted jalapeno crema. Not the prettiest piece of salmon I've seen, ours looked like it was burnt. 3/5  Mango Buttermilk Upside Down Cake:  Comes with rum caramel sauce and mango ice cream.  The cake itself was yummy then add mango ice cream? Sweet! 5/5  Deep Dish Banana Cream Pie: Cream and sliced bananas with praline wafer and hazelnut brittle on top. It was alright. 3/5  Mexican Chocolate Pudding: Comes with gingersnap crumble.  Yuck and I mean, YUCK! This would have been a sure-hit for chocoholics like me if it wasn't for the gingersnap crumble and all the spices they added to the chocolate.  It was just too much. 1/5",

    "text": "[This review is for the brunch menu.]  Mesa - this restaurant has been staring me in the eye for ages and I finally got to take it on with great results.    The menu is a Southern Tex-Mex style and lots of style indeed.  Dishes are flavorful and fairly bold in their interpretations of classic dishes you may be used to.  One of the early delights is the included bread basket with a lot of tasty choices.  My personal favorite was the blueberry scone and another really interesting bread concoction (not sure if it was a zucchini bread?)  My table ordered a variety of dishes from there (they also have a fairly robust wine list and margarita list as well along with a full bar menu) that ranged from lamb salads to amazing looking waffles.  From the dishes I tried, I surprisingly loved the tiger shrimp tamale the most.  The presentation was not only very well done but the flavors of both the tamale and the well-spiced tiger shrimp hit the spot.     My only small complaints were that some of the dishes didn't seem as strong as the others.  The house margarita (I believe called the patrida) was a little more hit-or-miss - not as sweet but not as flavorful as other margaritas I've had either.  The Spicy Chicken Sweet Potato Hash also was a little more on the not-so-sure side.  I liked the presentation but the dish came out a little colder than expected and the sweet potato hash wasn't as flavorful.  Perhaps an off day for the dish?    Service was excellent for sure (friendly, fun and keeping tabs on us regularly) and brunch on a Saturday was surprisingly not that busy.  The decor has a fun fire theme throughout the entire restaurant that goes from the ceilings to the lighting - I really dug the theme.    All-in-all, Mesa is a fantastic restaurant stop and the brunch doesn't burn the wallet either.  A worthy check out.",

    "text": "The GF and I were looking to indulge in a proper lunch before leaving for our flight back to Philly. So after checking out at Caesars Palace, we stopped by Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill. While the original NYC restaurant is now closed (he's got Bar Americain and the recently opened Gato now), in Vegas, the Iron Chef is still able to showcase the Southwestern flavors and flair he's known for.  Located a stone's throw away from the opulent Omnia nightclub, Mesa Grill is sleekly designed with Southwest elements and colors.   Bread Service  Bread service started us off with a nice variety of freshly baked sourdough, cranberry walnut, and a great blue and sweet corn muffin with a bit of jalapeno. Nice.  Goat Cheese Queso Fundido [$16] Rajas, blistered serrano vinaigrette, blue corn tortilla strips  We had the goat cheese queso fundido, which was gorgeously creamy. It had some nice heat from the blistered serrano vinaigrette, which was accented by the roasted red and green chiles. The cilantro added a nicely fresh herbaceouness to each bite. The crispy blue corn tortilla strips were a great vessel to scoop up all the deliciousness.  Tiger Shrimp & Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale [$18] Corn, cilantro sauce  Easily one of the best tamale's I've had, the creamy richness of the roasted garlic and sweet corn sauce on point. The tiger shrimp was supple, yet had good snap and the corn masa within was luxurious and not at all dry. The cilantro sprig helped to brighten up each bite.   Spicy Chicken & Sweet Potato Hash [$18] Poached eggs, green chile hollandaise  The GF went with the spicy chicken and sweet potato hash for her main. There was a great lusciousness to each bite, with some texture from the sweet potato and the moist chicken. The green chile hollandaise had a bit of heat to it, though very slight. The poached egg brought each bite over the top.   Cornmeal Crusted Chile Relleno [$18] Roasted eggplant, manchego cheese, sweet red pepper sauce, balsamic vinegar  My cornmeal crusted chile relleno offered great texture from the cornmeal crust, which cracked open to reveal a creamy manchego malenge with well-roasted eggplant. The green and red sauces emblematic of Bobby Flay were on display here and not just for show. Along with the sweet notes from the balsamic, these sauces helped to providing some acidic balance to each bite.   Overall, Mesa Grill was spot on in terms of execution and taste. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend stopping by, especially if you're looking for a glimpse into the flavors that are the foundation of Iron Chef Bobby Flay.",

    "text": "We stopped by for lunch and found the place surprisingly good, given our poor luck with restaurants run by celebrity chefs. The tiger shrimp tamale was the best dish we tried. The blue corn pancake/barbecued duck and rough cut tuna \"nachos\" were fine. Most disappointing was the pork tenderloin sandwich. The complimentary bread basket was very good as well, with the yellow/blue corn muffin and jalapeno bread being the highlights of the bread basket.  The tiger shrimp corn tamale was our favorite. There was nothing innovative here, but the shrimp were grilled and seasoned perfectly, and the corn tamale was on the sweeter side which complemented the shrimp. The corn tamale was soft and not firm, like in more authentic tamale. As such, the dish came off more like a shrimp and grits, with the corn husk mostly for show. The corn tamale was on the sweeter side, like sweet cornbread. The cilantro sauce was good, though the cilantro flavor was more of a hint, rather than a definite presence. There wasn't anything innovative with the dish, but everything tasted very good.  The bread basked, surprisingly, was my second favorite item. It came with a hybrid corn muffin which was half yellow corn and half blue corn. It was sweet and went well with the butter. More impressive was the jalapeno bread, which reminded me of the jalapeno cheese bread that you can get at the Schats Bakery on the way up to Mammoth from Los Angeles, however this bread didn't have the cheese. As such, it wasn't as impressive as Schats version, but it was still pretty tasty. The other bread that came with the bread basket was more commonplace. It was a raisin walnut bread which was fine, but nothing spectacular.  The rough cut tuna \"nachos\" was fairly tasty. In essence, it was like tuna tartare, served with some flour tortilla chips and blue corn tortilla chips. It was served on top of mango-habanero sauce and avocado crema. The mango-habanero sauce (which was surprisingly not spicy) tasted better than the blander avocado crema. Again, the dish was executed well but nothing innovative. Similarly, the blue corn pancake/barbecued duck was fine, tasting like a less flavorful version of Beijing/Peking duck. There wasn't anything really memorable about this dish, but it was not bland.  The most disappointing dish was the New Mexican spiced pork tenderloin sandwich. The best thing of this dish were the fries. The pork tenderloin was soft but otherwise bland. It didn't taste much of any New Mexican spices. In addition, the ancho chile mayonnaise tasted more like plain mayonnaise, missing a lot of the flavors of ancho chile. Given the description, this dish was surprisingly bland, and we would opt to try something else next time.  All in all, everything was well-executed and was well seasoned, with the exception of the pork tenderloin sandwich. You get a hint of Southwestern flavors, but the flavors are held back to appeal to a broader audience. I wished that some of the flavors were punched up a bit more, but overall, we were pleasantly surprised by our lunch at Mesa Grill.",

I ordered a margarita and asked if they could make it spicy.  The cocktail waitress replied \"no\".  I was surprised.  I thought: \"You can't get a spicy margarita at Bobby Flay's signature restaurant.\"  I  told the waitress \"all you have to do is put a few jalapeno slices in a regular margarita.  The waitress replied:  \"We don't do that here.\"  She was not even apologetic, and her tone was a bit rude.  The fact is any run of the mill bartender should be able to make a spicy margarita.  Bobby Flay is supposed to be known for his use of chili in his Southwestern cooking, but you can't even get a spicy margarita at his restaurant.  Further, they refused to even try to make one.    To be fair the food was good, especially a shrimp tamale we ordered.  However, all the food would have tasted better if I could have gotten a spicy margarita.",

    "text": "Finally!  Five Stars!   So I brought the hubby in for his birthday to celebrate a last minute planned dinner.  I have to say after my last experience here when I brought my sister for lunch I didn't leave excited to come back.    But tonight I had one of those odd cravings for the Lemon Tini that I sipped last time and I was determined that this time not only was I going to satisfy my craving, I would know NOT TO ORDER THE SALMON and to order instead what my sister ordered-the CORNMEAL CRUSTED CHILI RELLENO!  But more important to take the hubby to a great fun place for dinner on the strip.  We didn't have reservations but they found us a nice table with a fantastic waiter.  Drinks were Belgian Beer for the Mr. and for me the Lemon Drop Martini.  Sweet and sour just like it should be.  Loved it.  Squash Blossoms filled with yumminess just laying in a sauce of I don't know what but every bite was heavenly. Only three were on a plate-there should be at least four or five or six or...you will not get enough of these!  Chili Relleno was what I expected since my sister had ordered this last time we were here. The chile was stuffed with roasted eggplant and Manchego cheese, it rested on some sweet red pepper sauce and dusted with cornmeal that created the perfection.  OH MY! Crispy on the outside and gooey melted cheese on the inside with just the right amount of spice.  Hubby had the halibut and I had a bite of his and another flavorful exotic blend of flavors that will satisfy you and leave you asking for more.  We topped it off with dos cappuccinos and the churros con chocolate which came with two yummy chocolate dipping sauces and  a nice little candle.  The only complaint was that the churros were crispy and not warm and soft (c'mon even Sea World serves them up warm and fresh lets do this right next time). One sauce was chocolate and the other was Dulce de Leche.   Despite the lack of soft Churros, I'm sure I'll be back.",

Amazing Restaurant , great location right next to sports book. Passed on the desert, nothing really stuck out. Coffee would have been nice or even an expresso. When the waiter took the drink order he said two for one Margaritas, when the bill came we were charged for two. Asked the waiter why he said he did not say that and if they were he would be drinking now. Really?",

    "text": "I dined at the bar during my stay here at Caesar's. I had to wait for just a few minutes for a seat to open. I got their white peach margarita to start. The margarita was made strong and well. I couldn't taste the white peach but it was very good nonetheless.  I ordered my appetizer and entree based on the recommendation of the bartender. The blue corn pancake with duck for appetizer and the ancho chile honey glazed salmon for entree. The blue corn pancake was more like a crepe which paired perfectly with the BBQ duck. This dish was very good!   The salmon was cooked well but unfortunately it was too salty to eat. The first few bites were delicious - smokey flavors with a sweetness - but once I was working towards the middle of the filet, it became just salt. Then I found a big bone in my salmon as well. I left the rest of the fish untouched - at this point, it was inedible.  I rarely send back a plate and I did not send it back this time either. The bartender noticed and asked so I told him what was wrong with the dish. He offered the kitchen to remake it for me, which I appreciated, but it was late and I was already thrown off by the dish.  I was disappointed by my experience with the entree at Mesa. I wished it was edible.",

The food was yummy to the tummy. I started out with the lobster tacos. They were so delicious and I think the best I have ever had in my life. Every bite full of lobster. I think I died and went to heaven. My favorite part of the meal was the tacos. Next I tried the chicken skewers these were scrumptious and the pickled onion and flavors were bursting in my mouth. I was so happy and impressed. For my entree I tried sixteen spice chicken. It sounded very exciting. The portion was generous and the flavor was good. I did expect it to be a bit more exciting after being wowed from the appetizers. So it was good, but not great. Overall I highly recommend this restaurant. I had a great experience and left full and satisfied.",

They put us down for 6:00.  Of course, the traffic was horrible, so I called back and asked if we could change our reservation.  They informed me that since I didn't secure our reservation with a credit card that we, in fact, didn't have one.  The person I spoke with on the phone was not helpful and very rude. She proceeded to argue with me about whether or not I had a reservation till finally I asked if I could just, please, make one.  I made the new reservation for 6:30 and she let me off the phone without a credit card.  Then when we arrived at the restaurant the Hostess, rudely, told me that we didn't have a reservation, she was adamant about this, till I pointed at my name, written down on her sheet next to \"6:30\".  I had a beer (corona or tecate?), the Lobster Tacos (appetizer), and the sesame crusted ahi.  It was alright.  The portions were very small.  My daughter had a cheese quesadilla and milk.  The bill for just myself and my daughter came out to $100.  The service was good but there wasn't a lot to it.",

I also want to give a special shout out to the bartender, Ephran. My wife and I love to eat at the bar here. My wife likes Chardonnay, but they had none by the glass. After serving her samples from a couple of different white wines, she wasn't digging any of them. Instead of letting it drop, he came back with an open bottle of chardonnay and not only let her have it by the glass, but gave her the last glass complimentary. All the bartenders here are great, as is the service overall. Add that to the food, which I consider the best of any restaurant I've ever been to, and it's an unbeatable dining experience. I'll be back in November! Mouths already watering thinking about the blue corn pancake with duck!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I came here for his birthday dinner and I'm thoroughly impressed, it was much better than I had anticipated. I've looked over the menu before and thought it was a pretty normal menu but it was spectacular!  For appetizers, we had the corn soup and chicken skewers. Let me tell you the portions may look itsy bitsy but it's more than enough to start your meal with. The soup was tangy with a hint of heat and it was so unbelievably smooth. And the chicken skewers. WOW! The plate comes with three skewers, a gloried BBQ sauce and some pieces of lettuces, mint and parsley. I had no idea what to do with the lettuce until our server pointed out that I would make little wraps with it. Boy am I glad she caught that. It was delicious. The chicken is nice and charred on the outside but still wonderfully moist and juicy on the inside.  For the main course, my boyfriend got the black angus stead and I got the salmon. I'm not much of a beef person, but my boyfriend knows his steak. In his opinion, the steak was more than worth the $50. The chef got the temperature just right and underneath the steak was the BBQ sauce with a blend of other really colorful sauces. And we were both surprised at the portion of the steak. It was almost double what you normally get. The salmon also had the same bed of sauces, a little repetitive but it was delicious no less. I got it cooked medium because that's how our server recommended it (it was pink in the center) but I'm sure you can request it to be cooked through more. The salmon was great! Nice and moist and the outside had a really nice sear on top.  For dessert, we had the toffee bread pudding and the chocolate bread pudding. When my boyfriend ordered a glass of wine, our server noticed it was his birthday a few days prior and brought out his dessert with a little candle in it! I thought that was nice! :D Unfortunately, I was less than impressed with my dessert, hence one star less. They had a pretty comprehensive dessert menu too, in case you're much of a sweets person you can order a 15 year old Bourbon instead!  Now, the service was speedy and so friendly! So so friendly! Sat us down with a smile and sent us away with a smile, so that made the night even better.  All in all, if you're looking for a trendy and casual place to eat, this is your spot. No need to decipher fancy french menus here!",

The waiter and other staff were attentive without being overbearing, and I loved the spacing between courses.  You won't have to give up your whole evening to this place (but you're welcome to if you'd like) but you will also never feel hurried.   We started with the queso fundido, which was a delicious introduction to the southwest flavors on the menu.  I ordered the scallops, which were lovely, but the grits underneath were the showstopper.  If I could have ordered a side of just those, I would've done it right then - so good!  My husband agreed and stole the few bites I was willing to share.  He ordered one of the steaks and reports that it was excellent.  I loved the raisin bread and corn muffins served before our meal.  Overall, a great experience.",

We started with a few appetizers and drinks.  We had the tiger shrimp and corn tamale and the blue corn pancake with duck.  I think the duck appetizer was my favorite. The flavors were really good. The tiger shrimp tamale was okay. For drinkage,  I had the house margarita and I believe a cactus/pear cocktail.  The margarita was delicious. One of the best margaritas I've had..EVER. Don't bother getting any other cocktail really...It's a waste of time.   For entrees, hubby had the spiced rubbed pork tenderloin. It was delicious. It had a nice heat and the meat was tender and juicy.  I had the strip steak cooked medium. It was delicious and cooked perfectly--and HUGE.  I usually order fish, but I thought I would mix things up and I did not regret it.   The sides were amazing. The mashed potatoes with the queso gravy...Heaven. Pure heaven.  We also had brussel sprouts, which were okay.   For dessert, I had one of the dessert wines and we shared churros. The churros didn't blow me away.   The service was outstanding. Plates didn't stay on the table. Water glasses were filled every time you took a sip.  The server was knowledgeable on the menu and made great recommendations.   I would definitely recommend going to Mesa if you are looking for a great dinner spot on the strip.",

What ruined the experience for us were the cold hosts and waiter.  These kids had an irritated expression on their faces throughout the entire service.  Our first experience with a hostess when we walk in was seeing the back of her head while she spent a couple minutes trying to figure out where to put some sort of vase or jar in a drawer.  I had to say something to get her attention.    After we finished eating our entrees, our kid waiter tossed the dessert menus on the table without saying anything and quickly left.  I tried to get his attention to let him know we didn't want any and I guess he didn't hear or didn't care to turn around.    As we were leaving, the host past by and said a cold farewell with an irritated expression on his face, without having the courtesy of looking at us.  I'm not asking for a Chili's-type super excited \"Thanks for coming!\"  But I did just drop $160 on a $135 bill.  A little less attitude would be nice.  Out of the four people we came in contact with on the wait staff, only the older gentleman acted like he worked in a [former] Michelin-starred restaurant.  If I could have personally handed our tip to that older gentleman, I would have and left nothing for the others.  I would have come back for the food, but I won't be back due to the fast-food-like service.",

I'm not, however, a fan of lamb so I asked to substitute with chicken on the Cobb salad. I was told, even after our waiter took the time to check with the kitchen, that I could only get the salad with their 16-spice chicken.  What???  I can't get any plain, grilled chicken on my salad?  We left. Pretty disappointed, Bobby. I had high hopes seeing as though I love you so much!!",

    "text": "Good restaurant especially if you are catching a show at the Colosseum or monitoring the sports-book. I understand that since I was dining along that the hostess directed me to eat at the bar. However I was none the less put off as I saw there were plenty of empty tables throughout the evening. Maybe I am being picky but I don't really enjoy having my dinner sitting at a high top as I'm fairly short and my feet barely touch the bottom bar. Overall the food was fairly decent and a lively place to dine with friends. Noise level is about average. I ordered a glass of white wine, queso fundido (would be great for groups), honey glazed salmon, sauteed spinach, and a late harvest tokaji for dessert. Food was delicious, the queso fundido is a bit heavy and I would imagine it would be good to share. I would say attire shift from business casual to a bit more formal as the night wears.  I would definitely dine again the next time I am in town for regular dinners but maybe select another place for special occasions.",

For brunch I had the Sweet Potato Chicken Hash with Poached Eggs. The green chile hollandaise sauce alone was divine.  The meal was substantial enough to suffice for a brunch.  The dinner I had the next day was the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin. This dish comes with a side of a sweet potato tamale with crushed pecan butter which I enjoyed the most.  The texture of bits of crushed pecan in the tamale was a nice surprise.",

    "text": "Summary: A great meal at a pretty high price.  Service is attentive and friendly.  Food quality is excellent, as expected.  Flavors and textures are superb.  Definitely a pricey meal, but worth it if you're cool with it.  Three friends and I visited Mesa Grill for the first time during CES 2013.  We made reservations for 8:45pm and showed up a few minutes early.  We waited for 15 minutes or so to be seated and I imagine that is the norm.  Soon after we were asked what type of water we wanted and greeted by our server.  He took our drink order and we selected our starting beers.  The beer selection was not big but was high quality.  Good stuff.  The wine-by-the-glass selection was not very impressive and had a pinot noir listed under the white wines.  Strange.  We scanned the menu and selected our entrees.  A basket of olive bread and jalapeno bread was placed at our table so we noshed on that as we placed our orders.  Coffee Ground Filet - This was my entree.  A pretty large filet mignon, perfectly cooked to my specs (medium), and sliced horizontally so that the top half rested on top of the bottom half.  The texture and quality of the beef was fantastic, as expected.  The taste was superb.  At $50, this was a pricey piece of beef, but it was one of the best steaks I've ever had.  Mashed Potatoes with Queso Sauce - A nice little cup of creamy mashed potatoes with a little queso sauce on top.  Very tasty and smooth.  An excellent pairing dish with the steak.  Pork Tenderloin - I nabbed a bite from one of my friends.  This was the first pork tenderloin I had ever had.  It was very tender, very flavorful, and otherwise delicious.   Twice Baked Potato - I got to sample another friend's side.  This is basically a half potato that is super soft on the inside and has a layer of crispiness on the outside.  This was really good, too.  The only disappointment in the meal was for one of my friends that got a NY steak.  He has for it medium rare and it came out way too rare.  He asked for it to be cooked a little more, and when it was brought back out it was done much better.  Aside from that hiccup, everything about the meal was fantastic.  The prices were not cheap.  Obviously, that is to be expected.  Overpriced?  Yeah, probably to an extent.  However, the quality of the food, service, and experience was excellent.  I would definitely consider coming back again if I had some money to burn.",

The restaurant was gorgeous with pops of color and elegance.  All the waiters were so friendly and courteous. For dinner we had it all.  I had Bobby's favorite margarita which was a delicious classic margarita, I also tried the white peach margarita which was my favorite. You get a complimentary bread basket which has three different varieties, all were delicious.  For starters we ordered the peppers and the kale salad, those did not last long with three hungry girls!  For my meal I had the New York strip which had an amazing charred outside with a juicy tender inside, so yummy! Also had the potatoes on the side to share.  We all left so full and happy and we can't wait for our next visit to flay-vor town!!",

Next, the service wasnt very good, our waiter spilled our drink on the table and then we didn't receive part of our order and he had to go back. We then over heard another table not receive a part of their order as well. I feel like the server dropped the ball on a few occasions and did not offer anything in return. The food is very over priced ($20 for a half a tamale and \"tiger prawns\" I think that name is very misleading since they were small shrimp). We also ordered the egg tostada and it was basically just a scrambled egg on top of a tortilla. To spend that much money and leave unsatisfied and still hungry is very disappointing.  Watching Beat Bobby Flay now really gets me thinking how his food really does taste since the food wasn't as appetizing as I thought it would be. I don't think we will go back.",

It was by no means the most expensive, that honor goes to Joel Robouchon, but the value per tastiness level at Mesa was excellent.  By no means is this restaurant a low priced Mexican joint. The $11 tiny size pumpkin tamale will prove that. Boy, it was a tasty tamale, though.   Barbara S. and I had 3 course meals. I drank 2 beers, she had a glass of wine. We dropped $270 before tax and tip.   Server was a professional delight. Well informed, smart, engaging and helpful. He served over 8 tables with perfect elan.   Dining room is big, crowded, noisy.

His style, his technique, his celebrity, his brand... all of it.  We arrived about 15 minutes early for our reservation - they wouldn't seat us until our reserved time. Not a chance so we grabbed a  margarita and waited for our table at the bar.   Everything we ordered was amazing. Do not miss out on the goat cheese queso fundito or blistered shishitos. We shared the pork tenderloin entree. I tried to order as slowly as possible. Savor the Flayvor! The folks next to us were champions and ordered the tasting menu. That's the route to go if you want to sample a lot of big food.   I'll go back to Mesa every Vegas trip from here on out. Service & vibes were phenomenally fantastic and the wine selections pair well with the menu.  Don't bother asking for an oaky chard, they'll say no and steer you back towards their collection, mostly Spanish wines.  The wine recommended for pairing with our tenderloin was unfamiliar to me but absolutely spot on.  Overall amazing experience here. GO!!  Thank you, Mesa.",

Like most strip restaurants, it runs on the pricey side but its one of the few that I would say is probably worth it. The decor is minimalist and clean, the servers are always very professional, and the food is delicious, although not for the faint of heart. Being the picky eater that I am, I usually stick to the chicken quesadilla and one of the steaks. My more adventurous friends have tried most of the other things on the menu and they always rave about it. My favorite part of any meal is dessert though. I definitely recommend the apple cider cheesecake. As for the churros, as my friend so aptly put it \"Costco has them beat.\" One last note, make sure to get a reservation for when you go, the wait times can be really long without one.",

The kitchen is visible through the dinning room, which I liked.  The service was professional and not forced.    We started with some wine for me, and a margarita for my wife.   Both sections were good, but I should have joined my wife with one of the signature margaritas.  As for the food, we started with Bobby's signature tamale with shrimp topped with a garlic cream sauce and garnished with fresh corn and cilantro.  It was one of the best things I have ever put into my mouth, Wow!    Got our entrees, I started with the special of the day.  It was brunch, so it was a strip steak marinated and grilled, served with pickled onion, eggs, avocado relish of sort, some kick ass southern glaze, yummy...  it was served with warm tortillas so you could make your own tacos.  My wife had the other special of the day, which was a sweet potato hash with chicken and roasted vegetables etc..  it was also really good; all the food was memorable.    We will be back on our next visit to Las Vegas.",

Terrific service from our waiter who explained the highlights of the menu without talking down to us.   From the margaritas and mojitos to the Queso to the entrees everything was delicious and VERY flavorful. Two of us had the huge Mesa Burger, one had the shrimp tacos and  I had the Chicken & Sweet potato hash.    As a matter of fact, it was so good that Sunday my husband and I went back for brunch.  We were up a bit early (10:30am) and there weren't many places open for brunch (which we thought was odd) but in checking around we found Mesa Grill was open and had a brunch menu (rather than just the usual lunch fare that many restaurants serve).  We had the bacon & hash brown quesedilla topped with a fried egg (the bacon was smokey and wonderful) and the Egg Sirloin Tortilla which is essentially fajitas with eggs & steak (and nice spicy garnishes).  The bread bowl mix was toward sweet breads (as one would expect) and they were all delicious.  And one of the best spicy Bloody Marys I've ever had.    I usually think most celebrity chef restaurants are forgettable and we'd planned just to stop for a drink and maybe an appetizer..., but this one was good enough to visit twice in one weekend.  I'll definitely be back!",

She also recommended us on what to order since we were first time there. The rest of the group got the Spicy Chicken with Sweet Potato Hash (a popular dish there for brunch) and I got the Grilled Mahi Mahi. We also got the \"Rough Cut\" Raw Tuna Nachos from the appetizers to share. Everything were amazing even though the Raw Tuna Nachos was a bit small in potion. The Mahi Mahi was good. The Spicy chicken with sweet potato hash was a great combination, nicely cooked and combined!  P.S. The napkins at the restroom were personalized with their logo on and it was well-quality made (you can still reuse it after it is wet!) That shows how considerate the restaurant is on even the smallest details.",

I hope that they never change the selection, I look forward to it every time I go to Vegas.   Brunch is fantastic. I had the salmon quesdilla with salmon caviar and it was heaven .The most light but tasty dish ever. Lunch is just as good and extremely satisfying. I had the grouper tacos but they substituted mahi mahi. The mahi mahi melted in my mouth and the deconstructed look of the plate was perfect, understated yet easy to comprehend. The slaw for the tacos was perfectly tangy and I could eat that all day if I had to.   If you are thirsty look no further than the cactus pear ice tea. It comes as a glass of ice tea and an accompianment of simple syrup infused with pear. I wish I could take a bath in it.   The service and I am a stickler for service is some of the best in Vegas. The waiters are attentive yet not on top of you and the bus staff is perfect, knowing when to clear dishes and how to present dishes in a formal yet understated way.  If you are a vegetarian they will accomodate you, do not worry.  Oh and did I mention the price?? So moderate for such a heavenly experience. You are a fool if you do not like this place.  I love Mesa Grill and would consider eating every meal there if I could.  Bobby Flay rocks!",

I am not at all a fan of Las Vegas, so if a restaurant can earn five stars, it certainly stands out amongst the smoke filled recirculated air and endless casino noise!  Very comfortable, colorful ambiance; the private dining room is a great spot for groups.  Had the great opportunity to diner here during a recent business trip.  As we were a larger sized party, we had a limited selection menu.  Note -- and still, Bobby get his five stars!  The roasted garlic corn tamale (sans roasted shrimp for this non-crustacean gal) was delightful -- his recipes take very simple plates and create amazing layers of flavor.  The corn cilantro sauce was great, and altogether, the dish had a surprising kick hidden within -- fantastic!  The grilled Mahi Mahi was cooked perfectly - left very tender, with a roasted pineapple/chili sauce and a pineapple salsa -- the combo of sweet, warm, and spicy!  (Mr. Flay certainly knows exactly how to use chiles and while he likely even includes chile with desserts, it works!  Service was excellent. Wine list was plentiful and had great options to accompany spicy foods!  Oh - and I LOVE the dining chairs in the main room -- wood frame with a red leather seat, backed with a cowhide insert on the back side of the chair. If anyone knows where I might find something similar, drop me a note!  Any San Francisco Mesa grills on the way??!",

Not to mention that fabulous breadbasket they served - the jalepeno bread was to die for!  For me it wasnt too spicy, but very well seasoned.  my sister thought it was spciy, but still great.. definitely would make a trip back here again.

But once I walked in and saw Flay's books for sale, I suddenly wondered...\"Is this Bobby Flay's restaurant...?\" After that I was excited to try the food and I have to say that I was NOT disappointed.  Food: The food was so delicious! We started off with the Yucatan Chicken Tacos, which was superb. The chicken, grilled onions, cilantro, and sauce had great taste and texture. For our entrees, Eddie had the Pork Tenderlion served medium, which he LOVED and I had the 15 (or was it 18) Spice Chicken, which was very good! Eddie also loved his tamale and we both loved the Cilantro Mashed Potatoes, which we ordered as a side. A+++ for the food!  Service: We were a walk in, so unless we wanted to wait an hour for a table, we could sit at the bar, which we did. And it was fine! Our waitress was attentive. She was also very knowledgable about the menu, which was great!  Price: A pricier restaurant, but if you are going to dine at Caesar's it's actually a cheaper place to go unless you want to go to the overpriced steakhouse next store or to the crummy buffet. Also, the price was well worth the quality and taste of the food.  Overall: We are definitely going back to the restaurant again the next time we are in Vegas. And when we go back to NY, we are planning on eating at his place over there as well!",

Sorry, but after this most-disappointing meal, I can't help pay your feed bills again.  We arrived early on a weekday and the place was fairly crowded.  We both ordered the Salmon--one medium-rare and one medium.  I was halfway through mine when I realized I was give the medium-rare one and not the medium I had ordered.  The waiter never bothered to check that one may have been cooked differently.  Wound up leaving the half of my undercooked fish because of it.  Suggest you talk to your servers about this type of mix-up.  Mashed potatoes and the twice-baked were extremely disappointing.  The mashed were very watery with an afterthought of some type of chile sauce or something on top.  The puny and tasteless half-baked was just that and it looked like it came straight out of the microwave.  It actually looked a little forlorn.  An appetizer (shrimp tamale) was OK, nothing special. Also  had two glasses of imported wine which was decent, as was the service, though that seemed rushed as times.  Again, I was extremely disappointed with this meal and would not recommend Mesa Grill to anyone.  Maybe it was an off night, but you never get a second chance to make a good first impression with me, anyway.",

It was a small job to find it in the maze Caesar's has become, but we were seated promptly and the people were nice. The decor was fun and we could watch the chefs at work through a window. I had a great margarita, then we had 2 appetizers, the shrimp and corn tamale and duck tacos. Both were tasty, especially the tamale, the duck perhaps a touch too sweet and chewy...still good! My husband then had the pork loin and loved it. It was spicy, but expected as the server explained it accurately. I had the Mahi with peppercorn sauce, and while it was good, it came out rare, not mecium rare, and then I had to wait while hub ate. I hate that. We also had the corn and loved it. Probably our favorite thing was the sweet potato tamale that came with his entree. The flavors were bold and deep, as they should be for southwestern fare. The dishes were very signature Flay. Thanks Bobby!",

The portions are very pretty good for the price you pay.  I also got to tried my friends Sixteen Spiced Crusted Chicken and the Ancho Chile-Honey Glazed Salmon and the chicken was very juicy and tasty.  Usually I avoid chicken dishes because I'm afraid they're dry, but this was very good.  For appetizers we had the Tiger Shrimp and Roasted Garlic Tamale and the Blue Corn Pancake with BBQ'd Duck (both recommended by our server).  I wish I could have another bite of the duck again, it was fantastic.  Very juicy, and flavorful.  Can't wait to go back and try more dishes!",

I stopped by for lunch at 11:15am, but they said they were only serving brunch. The lunch menu was not available until after noon. No big deal, the brunch menu had a good combo between breakfast dishes and lunch items.  I ordered a seasonal pumpkin soup, and Mahi Mahi for the main dish. Both were outstanding. They also brought an awesome assortment of breads, muffins, cranberry cornbread, etc. I ate all of them.!  The only issue I had was that although the wait service was very good, when they were cleaning the table next to me the bus boy and my waiter were complaining about another employee. Certainly a isolated incident that you likely would not experience, but it was unprofessional to do it in front of a customer in my opinion.   The waiter was otherwise great, but I was not offered a dessert menu which I found odd.  Maybe they just don't have dessert on the brunch menu.   It also was less expensive than I anticipated since it's such a famous place. So I gave it 4 stars because the food was fantastic, and if I go back and the other small issues were isolated incidents, I'd bump it to a 5.",

The first time I had Pork Tenderloin which was delicious. My girlfriend and son had the Filet Mignon. For sides we had the mashed potatoes and Corn Tamales. Everything was delicious and we were looking forward to going back the next time we were in Vegas.  The second time as a big disappointment however. This time I had the Grilled Lamb chops, while my family had the Rib Eye steak. The lamb lacked flavor, and the steak as overdone.   I would gladly go back and have what I ate the first time, but would recommend everyone to avoid what we had the second.",

But the only thing memorable there was the fact that I knew who Bobby Flay was before going the restaurant and their Shrimp Tamale was the best I've ever tasted, hands down. I was recommended to get fresh fish, so i got their grilled salmon even though it didn't look that interesting. My salmon tasted like Cumin; and to me, cumin tastes like bad b.o. My friend's pork sandwich was just whatever...not there is out of the extrodinary besides their shrimp tamale! I'll probably give it another chance the next time im in vegas, just cuz it's BOBBY FLAY! so why not...as long as I don't have to pay, Im good almost anywhere=)",

I had the NY Strip steak which was cooked perfectly medium rare.  I couldnt have asked for a better steak and for the size of the steak, I thought it was very reasonable in price...I actually couldnt finish the steak as I was so full.  They served some steak sauce on the side, but I thought the steak was too good to even bother with steak sauce, although I did enjoy the spiciness of the sauce.  Somebody else had ordered the pork tenderloin which was amazing as well.    I had a side dish that was a tamale and it was excellent.  I dont really know what was inside of it but it had a texture that made me think there was nuts.  Everyone who had ordered the baked potato loved it.  Somebody ordered the collared greens which I tried, but I was not too impressed.  They were probably the only thing that I would not have ordered again.  Overall, it was a great experience and I would try it again",

Sooo...welcome to Vegas, where people gamble while they eat and sleep (duggh). The restaurant is just located at the heart of Caesars Palace, where you can actually dine while looking at people losing their money. Other than that, the restaurant still retains its an upper-class atmosphere. Therefore, please dress appropriately if you want to dine in the dining area instead of the bar. (Don't be like me. I was wearing a tank top, which was a big mistake.)  Nevertheless, the waiter(s) still greeted me friendly & guide us to the bar area for lunch, not to mention that the bartender had a great conversation with us. It was very pleasant to be served by these folks.  I had a smoked salmon club for lunch. Unfortunately, I wouldn't say the club sandwich was up to my expectation. The sandwich was way too moist, which made it fallen apart very easily. Also, probably it was because of the moist of the fish, the sandwich was very greasy for me, and I found it very difficult to taste the freshness of the fish...I'm sorry, but it was a disappointment. However, the fries! The damn fries were just awesome! Not only the fries were crispy, but they also had house-mixed spice on them, which was incredibly delightful to eat them. My colleague ordered a New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich, which was a lot better than my club sandwich in my opinion. The pork with the spiced mayo was very well done. I would suggest you to give it a try rather than the smoked salmon club sandwich.  Overall, the dining experience was nice because of the great customer service & the fries. However, I can't give anything more than 3 stars because my main dish just did not live up to my expectation.",

Here's my comparison of the two:  Brunch bread basket was better... which says a lot cuz I'm a sucker for the jalapeno cheese bread at dinner. But there's like some coffee cakes and oatmeal things and mini jalapeno muffins that were all delicious.   If you go for dinner you HAVE to get the cactus pear margarita on the rocks. By far the best margaritas we've tried to this day. Also their side of corn is amazing but seasonal. The tiger shrimp appetizer and rough cut tuna nachos are go tos for us as well.   As far as breakfast goes, we got both quesadillas (one with egg and one with salmons- i forget what they were called) and they were delicious. The sweet potato clam soup is also great, we've had it twice. It was better the first time but still very good. My waffles... AMAZING. I could have eaten a whole stack! My husbands potato hash Benedict wasn't as spectacular. The flavor was fine but it was all one note texture wise. Very mushy. The mango glazed bacon was good- take it or leave it.   Overall we are fans on Mesa and always come back. Usually we get a couple things we know we love and always try something new as well! Our service has always been excellent.",

To my dismay, they were not present on the menu today (or even by special request).   The bartender suggested the crab cake instead, so I reluctantly ordered it and a side of roasted Brussel Sprouts with a pomegranate glaze. I cannot begin to describe the level of elation experienced by my taste buds. Each bite made me feel as a goddess sitting on a Grecian Edifice awaiting a bunch of grapes to fed to me one-by-one.   There was NO filler added to the Crab cake, just bite after bite of tender lumps accented by green and red chili peppers.  The Brussel sprouts were perfectly accented by the glaze and complimented with fine sprinkles of Cotija cheese.   I cannot wait to come back to try the plethora of margaritas listed.   Until next time, Mesa Grill....",

He was so friendly and helpful.  I asked him his recommendations and he went through a good portion of the menu and explained each dish.  They first serve you three different kinds of bread, that includes a jalapeno corn muffin.  All three types of bread were very good, and we ended up getting a refill.   I had the tiger shrimp tamale for my appetizer. Thought it was good (not off the charts), but very overpriced - &19. Normally I would never spend this much on an appetizer, but figured I was on vacation, so why not.  I then got the ancho chile-glazed honey salmon.  I had previewed the menu online before going to this restaurant and this was not what I thought I was going to pick, but Ichabod sold me on this.  I usually am pretty picky about salmon, and rarely order in a restaurant, but wow, am I glad I got this.  It was amazing.  I could eat this every day.  Would highly recommend this.  Best thing I had in Vegas.  Just thinking about it makes me want to fly back to Vegas just for lunch.  I've been to TV chef's restaurants before and been disappointed.  I watch Bobby Flay on several of his cooking shows including Beat Bobby Flay.  I now understand why he beats almost everyone who competes with him.  He is truly legit.",

Since we ended up having nine people, I called the restaurant and changed the reservation to a party of nine at 12:15pm. Not sure if OpenTable has a max headcount in terms of reservations, but I wasn't able to change it through OpenTable.  *GOAT CHEESE \"QUESO FUNDIDO\": Rajas, Blistered Serrano Vinaigrette + Blue Corn Tortilla Strips ($17) *SPICY CHICKEN + SWEET POTATO HASH: Poached Eggs + Green Chile Hollandaise ($18) *RANCH STYLE EGGS TOSTADA: Crispy Flour Tortilla, Red Chile Sauce, White Cheddar Cheese + Creme Fraiche ($18) *SPICY SCRAMBLED EGGS: Green Onion, Jalapeno, Goat Cheese, Apricot-Mustard Glazed Ham + Buttermilk Biscuits ($20) 2 *BLUE CORN BUTTERMILK WAFFLE: Blackberry Bourbon Syrup + Vanilla Creme Fraiche ($15) 3 *MESA BURGER: Double Cheddar Cheese, Grilled Vidalia Onion + Horseradish Mustard served with Southwestern Fries ($20) *GREEN CHILE CHEESEBURGER: Queso Sauce, Roasted Poblanos, Pickled Red Onions + Southwestern Fries ($20) *Spicy Mango - Glazed Bacon ($6) 3 *CACTUS PEAR ICED TEA ($4) *SPICY BLOODY MARY ($12) *MIGHTY LEAF TEAS: Organic Earl Grey ($5) 2 *Partida Margarita: partida blanco tequila, partida organic agave nectar + fresh squeezed lime, straight up ($16) *Don Julio Silver Premium Margarita ($15) 2 *The Mesa Grill Margarita: sauza 901 tequila, made with fresh lime juice + triple sec, served on the rocks ($14) 2 *White Peach Margarita: sauza 901 tequila, white peach puree + fresh lime juice ($15) *Mimosa ($12) *Pepsi ($4)  You get a huge complimentary basket of breads, biscuits, etc. Good start for any carb lover. I ordered the queso for the table as I love cheese. It wasn't sure if I'd like the goat cheese as it can add a tanginess I don't like. But it was mellow and not too strong. I got the mesa burger, a side of bacon, and the partida margarita. The margarita had a nice tartness to it, but I found the drink itself too sweet and weak. I partly wanted to order a shot of tequila to add to my drink. The burger was pretty good. Cooked to a perfect medium rare. The fries were crispy and the horseradish mustard was fun twist to making my burger spicy. I don't really like sweet bacon, so I'm glad I didn't really taste the mango glaze. I also got a tea as I needed caffeine, but I found it pricey at $5 for a tea bag and a pot of hot water to share between two people. A girlfriend ordered the spicy scramble and got House Ground Hominy Grits with it. Not sure if it came with her meal, but we weren't charged for it. Otherwise, a side is $4.  Service was good as seven of us got here closer to 12:30pm and the last two filtered in later. The boys, a girlfriend, and I had to catch a flight in the late afternoon, so we needed to be out of there by 2pm. It wasn't too hard getting the bill and paying for our meal.  Nice place for brunch / lunch. I'm not the hugest Bobby Flay fan, but he does know how to make a burger and cheese dip. Now, if only the margaritas were better. Maybe I'll just ask for a double next time.",

To minimize the possibility of not being seated during my time in Las Vegas, I made a reservation about 1 week in advance. I came on time and was seated immediately (which is not terribly surprising as there were a few open tables). I found the staff attentive and generally knowledgeable. Additionally, I felt I was treated well as a table-for-one.  I opened with the rough cut tuna nachos upon recommendation. The fish was served raw and carried a nice spicy flavor: extra marks for a good start. For mains, I asked the waiter for a suggestion and he said the pork tenderloin was the signature dish (which came with a tamale), after mentioning a couple of \"best sellers\"--something I felt was a little bit of an off-note. I broke briefly for relief and found that my napkin had been removed from my chair, neatly folded, and placed topside....  The main course was good: plenty of flavor and cooked well (not well-done). The tamale was cold and not up to standard; however, the pork was tasty and decidedly offsetting.  I asked to see the dessert menu and a wine list. Later, I asked for a pairing and had the banana cream pie with the wine suggested. This made for a good finish and a fine evening.   4 stars.",

    "text": "I have been going to Mesa Grill in Caesar's palace for many many years, probably 5-6 times at least.  I have always loved the restaurant and it was my go-to place for brunch in Vegas. My last review was 5 stars. However, this time, I invited new guests to enjoy brunch at Mesa Grill and overall, it was an embarrassing and unpleasant experience.  First, one of our guests (a 70 year old Vietnam veteran) was asked to remove his hat (which was a Vietnam vet hat).  I understand there is a hat policy, however we then saw women in hats throughout the restaurant + even a man with a flipped back baseball cap.  If you are going to have a policy and actually ask a guest to remove the hat, at minimum you should be consistent and unbiased in your approach.  Our server was atrocious.  He interrupted our conversation many times, was super confused about our order.  I explained I had a dairy allergy and he insisted on announcing that information loudly and then got confused on another guest's order thinking they had a dairy allergy.  Once our food arrived, he forgot numerous items including maple syrup for waffles, an order of bacon, and delivered sauces to the wrong people.  We literally had to get up a few times to go to the kitchen to ask for syrup while the waffles were getting cold.  We complained to the manager, and they sent us a new server... but never checked in to see how we were doing.   It was so bad, we finally got up and tried to speak to the manager. The manager was incredibly rude to us and said if we liked the food, we shouldn't worry about the service. This really was the end for us as by now our whole party was upset.  Honestly, the whole experience was so bad, I can tell you I will never visit this restaurant again. It's really a shame as the food is great and I love Bobby Flay, but this has tarnished the whole brand experience for me.  It's not that hard to deliver good service and with so many great options in Vegas I am certain I can find a better location for brunch.",

My mom doesn't like anyone's cooking but her own and she loved this place. That says something!  We came here for lunch and I ordered the salmon! Honestly, I must say I learned that I don't know how to cook salmon because that was perfection. My mom had the steak and eggs and she said everything was perfect, even the spicy crema on the side. Yumyum! Must come back with the hubby I am sure he'll love it. Oh and their margaritas are to die for!  I had the cactus pear margarita and my mom had the peach margarita. Both were perfect. I know I keep using that word but the only thing missing at our lunch table was Bobby Flay himself ! Definitely recommend!",

It was cooked beautifully, but lacked in the flavor department. For a $36 dish for 1 piece of fish, I wasn't impressed.  The chicken was good, but not worth the price. 1 tamale for $19? No thanks.

This was our first meal of the day and we were starving.  We had a short wait of about 15 minutes but had a drink while we waited.  Our server greeted right away and his assistant brought us water and assortment of bread.  First of all the bread was really good.  There was a combination of mini bite size jalapeno cheese biscuit, blue corn and yellow corn bread (the best corn bread I've ever had) and two fruit type of pastry bars.    For the appetizers we had the tiger shrimp tamales and a crispy bacon hash quesadilla topped with a over easy egg.  Both were outstanding.  My wife had the chillaquilles and I had the burger.  Both entrees were delicious and so flavorful.    Service was on par and the atmosphere was great.  Highly recommend checking out Mesa Grill!",

Not  this time, folks. Go. To. Mesa Grill. Now. Really, it's just that simple. Do you want delicious upscale Southwestern food? If you're nodding and/or answered yes - get your booty here as fast as it will go.  The goat cheese queso was amazing and quickly devoured. So quickly in fact, that our waiter had to comment. Very funny sir. Bring me more of that for your insolence. The 'ritas were good - even my bf who normally doesn't like them enjoyed his. Not overly strong or sweet, they're like Goldilocks would say, just right. Entrees were HUGE! I wouldn't say Mesa Grill is pricey by any means, but you definitely walk out of there feeling like you got what you paid for. I had the salmon and the bf had the veal chop. Both were mouthwatering and required a few laps around the strip to work off.   Loved the decor and the ambiance inside. It wasn't too dressy, so jeans are acceptable.

    "text": "I have noticed that Bobby Flay is one of those chefs that people really like or really hate.  His television persona exudes a bit of social akwardness that at times comes off as arrogance.  It is undeniable that his New Mexico flavor profile brings a dimension to food that is beyond good cuts of meat that can be a dime a dozen here in LV.  The duck tacos as recommended by our server were excellent.  The smoky taste of the duck was well balanced with the sweetness of a hoisin style sauce, and then further complemented with a bit of heat.  That is the one thing I have noticed about food here at Mesa Grill.  They add heat without burning your senses but yet retaining the flavor profile of the chile peppers.  Tuna nachos were also very good.  The bone-in ribeye was excellent with a nice spice rub.  I prefer ribeyes when it comes to grilling because it provides a better taste when the fat gets slightly burned. A bit kinky, but delicious.  The side dishes went a bit unnoticed except for the corn with green chiles and cotija cheese.  Eating this reminded of the fair food where you get the corn on the cob and you can pile on the toppings.  Having a tequila menu was an added bonus.",

The interior of the restaurant is quite nice, but the atmosphere is a bit too casual for the prices it carries.  We ordered the Tiger Shrimp with garlic corn tamale and Pan Seared Squid for appetizers. Small portions but just enough and delicious to pique our appetite. The sauces are a tad too sweet. The tamale was very good, with fluffy texture and not seasoned to overwhelm the maiz. The squid was cooked perfectly, not too soft and not too chewy.  I had the veal chop which was recommended medium. I usually take my steak medium rare, but it was cooked perfectly at medium. It was juicy, and I loved the sauce - a little sweet like the other dishes, but the subtle horseradish really gave it a kick. The wild rice tamale was tasty, too, not too sweet.  Others in my party had the rib eye and the filet, both of which I sampled and found the sauce too sweet that it was hard to taste the meat. But my friends loved their dishes.  Double baked potatoes - delicious! Again with a hint of horseradish, it was a great combination of flavors. Brussel sprouts - way too sweet like candy and I didn't care for them. But that's my palate, and I'm sure some people like the sweet taste more than spicy.  Our waiter was attentive, and our water glasses were never empty. Between the 4 of us, the bill was $300 including tax & tip, with no drinks or dessert. It was a tasty meal and we enjoyed the restaurant. But some of us were still hungry after the meal -- we could do with more filler food.",

    "text": "I love being proven wrong about celebrity chef-endorsed restaurants;  Carnevino in the Venetian put me off making fun of Mario Batali forever.  His emblazoned name means some tasty meats, let me tell you.   But this restaurant has done nothing for Mr. Flay's Southwestern recipes.    A friend and I had lunch at MESA today, and before I get into the gory details, let me say the wait staff and bus service was very great.  Helpful on all sorts of problems;   for instance, there was a bug that crawled out of my friend's salad, stretched its little bug legs, and sat around for a minute while we waved down the help.     We assumed the bug had been knocked senseless by the over-seasoning of the lamb in the Cobb salad.  And over-seasoning is ridiculous here!   My pork tenderloin sandwich with Southwestern fries was like being double-teamed by rubs and seasoning salt.  Now the tenderloin was tender, but like my friend's lamb, there was no tasting of anything but chilis.     Without like an aioli or some kind of dill yogurt to give your mouth a rest, it all just blends into generic spice tastes.    Adding in the heavyness of the dishes such as the recommended goat cheese queso fundido (Which was very delicious, but served with generic and easily breaking nachos)  you are left queazy and overfilled.  20 minutes after our meal, on which the salad was comped and we were given free creme brulees (chocolate toffee, so rich and creamy), I began to feel very ill.   I ended up doubled-over in a forums restroom, the final and worst part of it all.  I think of it as a science experiment, and sometimes science produces great things.  Sometimes you irradiate yourself.  This was more of the latter.   A lot of nice little things, such as the help and appetizers, but outweighed by a couple unforgivable offenses.   I also don't like a meal so poorly spiced that it causes my body to actually reject it.    Sorry Bobby, maybe you should return and retune.",

Based on my experiences, I have decided that the best way to tell if a Celebrity Chef's restaurant is going to be any good or not is how much the restaurant relies on the celeb's name rather than the food to get people in the door.  My friend and I walked into Mesa for our last summer lunch together and were immediately assaulted by a shrine to Flay behind the hostess stand.  You can buy his books, chutneys, spice rubs, and probably posters in the restaurant.  The atmosphere of the restaurant didn't get much better.  As we were lead to our table, we walked past the open kitchen where the chef manning the grill was cooking burger after burger and piling them up off to one side.  Made to order, eh?  The table we were seated at was so close to another couple that I could have bumped the other lady with my elbow if I wasn't careful.  I know Mesa isn't an intimate date restaurant or anything, but I felt uncomfortable having the conversation I wanted to have with my friend there.  Our waiter had to crawl out of Flay's butt to bring us the day's specials.  \"Do you know Bobby Flay?  Did you choose Mesa because of Mr. Flay?  Do you watch Bobby on the food network?\" he simpered as he held the menu upside down in front of us.  His appetizer recommendation was good though.  The Queso Fundido was yummy.  As were the ($16) margaritas.  I was surprised they were that expensive at lunch time; I could have gotten similar cocktails at many other restaurants for $9-$12.  My biggest complaint about Mesa, and the reason I only give it one star, is the seasoning.  I get that southwestern spice, chilis and rubs are Flay's thing, but there's something to be said for subtlety.  I ordered a lamb cobb salad because I really like lamb and thought that sounded delicious.  Too bad I couldn't taste my lamb.  It was cooked perfectly and melt-in-my-mouth tender, but it didn't taste like anything but chili powder.  I love lamb because it tastes good.  Why go against that?  About halfway through my salad when I had pretty much decided I had had enough anyway, a little black bug crawled out from under a lettuce leaf and began crawling around the lip of my plate.  He was moving slowly, perhaps dazed by the spices as I was.  We quickly flagged down a busser (who had been really attentive about our bread, drinks, and water - I think he was my favorite thing about the meal) who brought the plate, still with bug, to our waiter.  He came and apologized, soon the floor manager came to apologize, but she did it in the rudest way I can imagine.  \"Why didn't you say anything when I came by earlier?\" she demanded.  \"Because a bug hadn't crawled out of my salad yet...\" I replied.  Then she went on to explain that in a kitchen their size, things like this are unavoidable.  I get it.  Produce gets bugs, my kitchen has a bug in it from time to time, but she shouldn't have admitted that.  The right thing to do is say I'm so sorry and leave it at that.  Funny story, when she had come by and inquired about how we were enjoying the meal earlier, I said \"It's ok,\" which is about how I felt.  She shot me the angriest look and stalked off instead of caring to find out why I wasn't happy.  My salad was comped, and I got a free creme brulee that was \"ok.\"  Maybe the dinner is better, but I will not go back to Mesa to find out.",

I'm a big Bobby Flay fan and have always wanted to eat at one of his restaurants. This one did not disappoint. The bread brought out before our meal was delicious. There were three types: a blue corn (we think?) cornbread, a raisin sweeter bread and I think a sourdough. All amazing. For our starter, we chose the tuna nachos. Warning: they're not really nachos. It's (delicious) tuna tartare with blue and white corn chips. For our main course, we chose to split the pork tenderloin. If you're hungry, don't split the entree; it's not enough. But we were still full from lunch so the 3 pieces in our entree was perfect for us to split. The pork had a perfectly seared crust and was so tender on the inside. And the sauce that accompanied it was amazing. We are it slowly to savor every bite. We also got the roasted corn side. It was perfect for two people to split and delicious; just a hint of spice. We were too full for dessert but it looked delicious. This was definitely one of the best dining experiences I've had in a while.",

I had the blue corn lobster tacos as a starter followed by the pork tenderloin, both were fantastic but I was stuffed! The serving size was HUGE for me, especially knowing I was going out later...big meals kinda make me wanna zzzzzzzz... anyways. Yum. The place is really good. The only negative, and this just my personal preference, was that it was very noisy. So if you are looking for a quiet, romantic spot for dinner? This isn't it. But go with an appetite when you do!",

Food: Bread basket: I love their jalapeno bread. Love! Love! Love! And it's free!  Appetizer: forgot the name, but it was chunks of tuna w/ jalapeno & cilantro bits w/ guacamole & mango sauce, came with a small bowl of blue corn & rice chips. Both the tuna & the chips were TASTY!  Entrees: 1. NY Steak - was EXCELLENT! Perfectly flavored, perfectly cooked.  2. Pork Tenderloin - This is their specialty dish and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD! The meat was tender, juicy, very flavorful. The tamale that came with it was just OK, rather dry unfortunately.   3. Tuna Steak - MUST SKIP! First time it came it was overcooked (dry, and cooked all the way, although I asked for seared w/ rare middle). The waiter was very polite and apologetic. He brought it back to the kitchen (I didn't ask for it, but he insisted). The second time it came, it was perfectly cooked, but WAY TOO SALTY. Seriously, I love bold flavors, but this made me think I was being punished for sending the food back. Again, I didn't even ask the waiter to send it back, so why was I being punished?  Service:  Was excellent, almost flawless.  Conclusion: The pork & steak dishes deserve 5 stars, but the severity of the flaw on the tuna steak, considering the price range is rather unforgivable.",

    "text": "I came here because I had a $50 voucher to dine at a restaurant in Cesar's palace, and I was familiar with Bobby Flay through his tv appearances though I had never been to one of his restaurant concepts. Here is the basic overview: Service was not great, and in some moments outright poor. Ambiance was nice, but extremely loud and crowded. Prices were out of this world. Food and drinks were good.  We walked in on a busy Thursday night looking for a table for three-- I did not think to make a reservation, which I now know I should have.  Our wait was to be 45 mins unless we could find something at the bar. No problem, we only had to wait about 5 mins to get a banquet.  However, once we were seated,  we did not see our server/cocktail waitress for at least 10 mins.  She finally dropped menus and didn't return again for a while.  This was odd to me because it didn't seem like she would have been responsible for a lot of tables unless she was assigned a section outside of the bar as well, which seems like a poor decision because my party felt neglected-- compounding that with the number of loud men drinking around us it made for a rather uncomfortable environment.  A party member approached the bartender ( who happened to have a number of empty stools in front of him) to inquire about our server and purchasing a drink, but unfortunately he was quite rude and dismissive-- he did not offer to serve her a cocktail and told her \"go sit down the server will get there when she can.\"  Hardly the type of response I would expect from a place where I would be paying $40 an entree.  Wow.  When our server came over she took our orders with no questions, and was helpful in that she knew the vouchers we were using-- she was clearly familiar with the promotion, which was nice.    Despite the bartender's rudeness, he poured a very good martini.  The food too was lovely.  The side asparagus and corn were fresh and flavorful!  I also loved the ahi in the ahi tartare and the chicken from the skewers was excellently flavored!!  I don't regret the food, but overall the experience was not what I would have hoped for especially for the money.  I might return to the New York location with a reservation... But I'm not sure that I would be so thrilled about dropping a minimum of $50 a person for food that ultimately wasn't very filling (we split 5 apps and sides and ended up needing to get something else an hour later).  Perhaps it would be different at a table? Definitely plan ahead for this dining experience.",

    "text": "Only in Vegas could you make reservations at a place that threatens to charge you $50 per person if you don't show up to be seated at a plastic folding table.  The service was fine. A little slow but they tend to drag their feet a bit when they're charging you a whole lot for not much substance, it's makes you feel like you're getting more out of the experience I guess.  I asked the waiter if they had any vegan options and watched him struggle through the menu before saying he'd have to ask the chef, which I don't think he ever did because we never got an answer.  Everyone in our party said they liked their meal but no one liked it enough to finish everything on their plate which says something.  Their prices are fairly astronomical for what you get and I believe that they try to cover up what is basic food with a fancier name. Roasted Corn Soup = one of the cartons of soup from Trader Joe's, Rough Cut Tuna Nachos = raw tuna chunks with a side of commercial grade tortilla chips, Cornmeal Crusted Chili Relleno = big jalapeno popper, Mango + Spice Crusted Tuna Steak = Chili's summer special.  I'm sure there are good aspects of this place, we just didn't see them.   I guess everything in Vegas is a gamble.",

Bobby Flay did not disappoint! Each main entree is a flavor explosion in your mouth and you just don't want it to end. The dessert was rich without being overly sweet - a plus in my book.

While the location may not do it for some, my buddy and I stopped in here for a quick bite to eat while betting on the NFL games as it is in direct view of the Sportsbook at Caesars.    Immediately on being seated we were brought a complimentary bread basket with absolutely amazing jalapeno corn bread, biscuits, and a cheesy garlic bread that was out of this world.  I ordered a diet coke which was repeatedly refilled and we were not charged for despite sitting around BSing for nearly 2 hours while my buddy drank two beers that he noted were well priced.  For meals, my buddy ordered the Mesa Burger with Double Cheddar Cheese, Grilled Vidalia Onion, and Horseradish Mustard on a House Roll with Southwest fries.....the burger was enormous and per his word \"awesome.\"  I opted for the Thick Cut Ahi Tuna Nachos with spicy aoili and blue corn tortillas.  While it appears this amazing dish has since been removed from the menu, I still contest it is one of the 3 best forms of raw tuna I've yet to consume.  The portion was large and at only $11 my total bill with tip for 2 baskets of bread, nachos, soda, and 2 hours of hanging out was a mere $15.  While this isn't \"5 star\" dining, it is one heck of a deal for high quality food in a nice 'bar' setting when in Vegas.  In retrospect I wish I'd have ordered dessert, but with dinner reserves at Simon later that evening I didn't want to overindulge.....y'know, after eating the Paris buffet for breakfast.",

The staff was amazing!  Our waiter was the best ever, he was nice and helpful and knowledgeable.  My husband had the Lamb Chops, they were very good.  I however ordered the most fabulous thing on the menu, the Pork Tenderloin.  It was spicy and the sauces were perfect, the meat juicy and cooked just right.  The tamale that came with my dish was a sweet potato.  I don't like sweet potato so they gave me a jalapeno one instead, and this was also great.  For dessert we shared a banana cream pie.  It was delicious as well, sweet but not too sweet.  The restaurant itself is large and you can somewhat watch the kitchen.  The grilling area is right out front for people to watch and as we left we heard the cooks asking someone watching them if they had any questions.  I thought that was great that they encouraged people to ask about what they were doing.  This entire experience was one of the best dining experiences I have had.  The pork tenderloin was one of the best things I have ever eaten.  Not kidding.",

    "text": "Holy Yum Batman!!!  This was the best dinner I had while in Vegas.  Our visit was near x-mas, so I can't speak to the wait time since there wasn't one for us. Our waiter was prompt, friendly, informative, and super observant. He was always quick to be at our table when it looked like we needed him.  We had the goat cheese appetizer, the quesadilla appetizer, the 16 spice chicken, the chicken tacos (an app, but it was my entree), the chile rellenos, and the salmon. (this was for 4 people).  After the appetizers we realized we weren't that hungry and were suprised at the portion size of our entrees. They're alittle small for the price. So it was good for our tummys but not for our wallets.  Churros were for dessert, the waiter talked us into it!  I would totally go back when i visit next.",

I was prepared to see maybe 3 small medallions on  my plate because well that is usually what you get at a restaurant like that. Perfectly cooked, small portions. I was so surprised when my plate arrived. There were huge pieces of this tenderloin just cooked to perfection. Mouthwatering good. I was so very happy. I tried my boyfriend's dish, he ordered the relleno. It was ALSO so delicious. If I go back, I will be ordering that.  Needless to say, I left that place with a giant gourmet food baby.",

Chili relano had this really thick dry crust that looked good but didn't go with the chili relano at all.  The tamale was so-so and the queso fundito dip was good but not $18 good.  Very disappointed.  Expected so much more for the price and an Iron Chef.  Service is whatevers too.",

After spending almost a full week in Vegas, we decided to give this place a shot.  We recommend that you make reservations early in the morning or a day in advance.  Dinner was great.  We started off with the Rough Cut Tuna \"Nachos\" and the flavor of this popped well and washed down with one of Bobby's signature  agave nectar margaritas.  My wife ordered the Green Chile Cioppino and I ordered the 22 oz chipotle glazed bone in rib eye for our entree.  We came away with a new found respect for Bobby and his restaurant.  We would definitely go back again.  The only thing that would have made this place a little better is if the dining tables were not so close together.",

    "text": "Well, looks like I don't have to upload any of the pictures I took because they're already up. :)  These were last minute reservations, like the same day. But we managed to get in. We only had to wait about 5 minutes to get seated which was good since I had read that they suck at keeping reservations.   After we were sat we ordered a couple of classic margaritas and some tiger shrimp and roasted corn tamale NOT tamal! haha We were served some bread which came with sourdough bread and some delicious corn muffins with jalapeno pieces in it. The margaritas were just right, with a nice kick of tequila. Then our appetizer came, the shrimp were meh but the tamale, it was not like any I've had before. This was a whole different experience and it was a good one. It kinda felt appart and had a kick of spice but tangy at the same time, Deliciously weird!  For our main course I had the New Mexican Spice Rubed Pork Loin and my boyfriend had the Black Angus New York Strip Steak. We also ordered a side of glazed baby carrots in chile de arbol and brown sugar.  Now, I'm not usually a big meat eater but I decided to order it and order it medium well. Boy what have I been missing out on. The pork was delicious. It almost made my eyes roll into the back of my head. That's how good it was. It also came with a delicious tamale. hmmm..just talking about it makes me wish I was back in Vegas. I tried some of the medium rare steak and that did NOT dissapoint either. I was very suprised since I am not into red meat. The carrots were alright.  For dessert we had some of their home made churros with chocolate dipping sauce. That should speak for itself!   Over all the place is pretty f'n amazing. They even went beyond expectations when I was there and some dumb broads decided it was cold and asked for a blanket. YES, they provided them with a blanket! The decor was modern, the staff was friendly and the food, like Candice B said is an \"Explosion of flavors in your mouth\". A MUST GO!",

I had a dream that you and I were barbecuing for our friends and family. One day Bobby we will bbq together! I bet my bbq is bettter than yous!!  You'll always be my #1 chef!  Melody  So as for the restaurant! I super love their food, the flavor, it's well cooked, and it has a Nice ambiance..  I tried different entree, Love all of them Salmon, Shrimp tamale (sounds weird right) but its so good, rib-eye, has a good flavor. Love their chorizo tamale and salmon/tuna fish tartar  with banana chips so good, wish they put more on the plate.  Will I go again? Of course, every chance that I get!! MUST try it, promise you wont get disappointed!!",

    "text": "Walking into a very colorful and nicely decorated restaurant...Mesa Grill (Celebrity Chef Bobby Flay's restaurant). Got reservation for lunch on Friday lunch and we were seated immediately. Our server James was very professional and recommended what's the signature dishes. I ordered the cocktail Bitter Firenze and my husband ordered the Patida Margarita. Both very good! The bread was very good and different. It has the blue corn bread/muffin and the crusty bead had jalapeno in it. That blue corn bread/muffin just melted in your mouth while the crusty bread had a very good flavor of jalapeno and crispy on the outside and soft inside.   Thanks for James's warning that we ordered only 1 appetizer or else we couldn't finish our entree. We ordered the tiger shrimp with roasted garlic corn tamale as highly recommended by him. It was just the best tamales I ever had. Very moist and packed with flavor with corn kernels. It had 4 tiger shrimp on top and the creamy cilantro sauce linked the tamales and shrimp very well together.  Our main entrees were here. I had the Pan Seared Halibut and my husband had the New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich. The halibut was just cooked perfectly with the new mexico chile and curry sauce which provided a slight kick. The pork tenderloin was to die for. It had the kick from the spices that were on the tenderloin while the ancho chile mayonaise added the heat level. For us both, it was not too spicy, but definitely had the kick. For people that do not eat spicy food, this might be hot for them. The french fries had seasoning on it and we didn't need any ketchup. We had to pass dessert as we were both very stuffed.   Had a wonderful first time experience at Bobby Flay's restaurant! The food definitely made the visit memorable, but the server James had made our visit very enjoyable! Will definitely come back to try their dinner meal soon!",

For 2 of us, got the tiger prawn tamale to start and a spicy chicken sweet potato hash and romaine salad as entrees.   As good as the spicy chicken sweet potato hash was (imagine a bbq tex mex eggs benedict), we kept wishing we just got more of the tiger prawn tamale. The tamale is very moist and fluffy with a good amount of sweet corn kernels for texture and the prawns were perfectly cooked in a creamy, but not heavy, sauce.   The hash was quite delicious, but eating half of the dish was sufficient as the bbq spicy sauce + sweet potatoes is a bit too sweet and overwhelming for a brunch dish. Salad was a good balance to the hash with fresh lettuce and good dressing.  5 stars for that tamale that haunts my dreams.",

    "text": "This was my second time dining here, and I do think it's a solid four stars. As much as I love Bobby Flay and Southwestern food, I just wasn't impressed the first time; however, my boyfriend and I were looking for a nice dinner that didn't break the bank all while offering great food and cocktails, so we decided to give it another go (mostly because all of our other \"hot spots\" were closed before Christmas, but I digress).  I will say they have excellent service. We had a wonderful waiter who was both polite and prompt. I started with the white peach margarita, which came out perfectly- slightly sweeter than the traditional but not so much that it's overboard. I had a terrible margarita before which really turned me off, but I think Mesa Grill redeemed itself on the cocktail part after this white peach one. As other reviewers have said, they have a nice complimentary bread basket that we both enjoyed. For my meal, I ordered Sophie's chopped salad and the tiger shrimp and roasted garlic corn tamale (appetizer) and my boyfriend had the New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin. The food is great, but my one quip is there is just not enough of it. I honestly felt like the appetizer portion was equal to the pork entree, which is kind of sad. It is really, really good, just sort of small. I'm not sure if it was just the pork dish or if all of the entrees are like this, but it was a little off-putting. You should not order a meal and still feel hungry after eating, sorry.  With that said, I've actually recommended Mesa Grill to a few other people traveling to Las Vegas and they've all had great experiences. Perhaps it's me, but I just can't say it's my favorite place in a city full of so many ridiculously good restaurants.",

It's not like I personally know the guy but let me give you an example.  He's into race horses.  He bought a race horse and named it after himself.  Yup..  Bobby Flay's horse is named Bobby Flay.  Can you get any more arrogant than that?!    Anyway, this is the 2nd time I had lunch here on my trips to Vegas and both times I enjoyed my meals immensely.  The dishes are so bold in flavor, you feel like your tongue is just dancing around in your mouth.  Spicy, sweet, salty, fresh.... he just hits your tastebuds with a smack.  The service is professional and polite.  I sat at the bar and had a couple of cocktails while I ate and I couldn't have been any happier.  Well... maybe I'd be happier if it wasn't Bobby Flay's place.  The man, not the horse.",

'Oh, there's something you should know' was the comment after each of us told him what we wanted to order, which helped make sure there were no surprises when we got our food :). The complimentary bread basket they serve is one of the best yet, with a great variety of breads both sweet and savory, and softened butter to go with! My greatest pet peeve at restaurants is when they give you rock hard butter for your bread, how are you supposed to use that thing?!   I ordered the bbq lamb cobb salad, which was just decent. The lamb was done very well and was very tender, and the bacon slices were tasty, but nothing about it was spectacular about it. They didn't seem to have the dishes that my friend had tried before during their brunch menu, so perhaps I need to come for dinner some time instead. For a first impression though, it was just ok.",

    "text": "As big fans of Bobby Flay, Mesa Grill has been on our food bucket list forever. And his food did not disappoint!  Margaritas - I can understand why Mesa Grill is famous for these. We tried the classic margarita and the cactus pear margarita. The classic was delicious with a good balance of flavors. The cactus pear was sweeter and while it started well, I was over the sweetness by the end.  Blue Corn Lobster Tacos - talk about a flavor explosion... these were amazing! Definitely try these.  Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops - tender, succulent lamb chops that were grilled to perfection. The mint chimichurri sauce was delicious. It came with a plantain tamale which sounded better than it tasted (again, my aversion to things too sweet).  22oz Bone-in Rib-eye - big, bold, yummy...  Roasted Brussels Sprouts - I know, I know, it's just brussels sprouts. But you haven't had these brussels sprouts. You must get these.  For dessert we had the Churros dusted with cinnamon sugar and star anise. The star anise was subtle and gave the churros an interesting scent and flavor. It was served with a dark chocolate and a coconut dulce de leche dipping sauce, the latter of which we could have licked out of the bowl. A great way to end the night.  As for dinner service, it left a little to be desired. Technically everything was executed fine. It's the little details like, the tables that flanked us were seated after us and offered dark napkins due to the customer's dark clothing. My husband and I were also in dark clothing but were not offered dark napkins, so I fussed with white lint on my black shirt the rest of the evening. And the server was effusive in his recommendations and menu explanations to both tables flanking us but didn't offer anything to us. It was weird and an example of how much better everything could have been.  Motivated by the exceptional food, we came back for brunch and had the spicy scrambled eggs - perfect balance of spice, creaminess, sweet, salty, tangy. The service was great this time and it was an awesome way to start the day.",

It was smokey, dark, and sweet. Love that the eggs were just lightly scrambled and airy. Also enjoyed the crispy fried tortilla on the bottom and dug that the layer of white cheddar lined the tortilla instead of traditionally being draped on the top. Was a huge portion however. I feel like they used 8 eggs just for the one dish!  Midlights: - Bread: just ok. I didn't think the corn muffin had much flavor. I liked blueberry coffee cake square the best  - Pork sandwich: expected more bold flavors from the pork itself but the crispy panini bread was very good  Lowlights: - Service: not very attentive--had to wait a while for our order to be taken   Liked my brunch dish and would consider coming back.",

I don't like spicy foods but the host said most of the sauces could be \"on the side\" if needed. Our waiter was Arnel & he made us feel right at home. Friendly & attentive, he helped make our dining experience memorable. I tried their peach margarita since I like to try different fruit-flavored ones & it was yummy!  Hubby ordered the grilled chicken & I ordered the grilled lamb porterhouse cops with the sauces on the side. I almost always order lamb when we dine out because my husband doesn't care for it. O.M.G.!!! From the very first bite, I knew this was, hands-down, the absolute best lamb I have ever had! Perfectly grilled, very mildly flavored & buttery soft, it was simply dreamy. If we had been home, I would have picked them up & cleaned all the meat off the bones! I did try a little of each of the sauces & although too spicy for me, they were very, very tasty & did add to the flavors.  My previous #1 had been lamb sirloin in Jackson Hole & #2 was lamb chops in Cambria. This is my new #1 restaurant for lamb! Coming back here for dinner next time we're in Vegas for sure!",

    "text": "I didn't really want to leave a review because I'm a business owner myself and petty reviews can hurt a business... but Saturday night me and my friends made reservations right after the Celine concert. We were seated, excited about eating a really nice meal... I felt a splash on my leg--like someone had spilled water--and a woman was vomiting all over her table and the floor. It was quite disturbing... I know this isn't the restaurants fault of course but here's the deal: my table had literally just got our food. I had taken 3 bites. Three, when this happened. Someone escorted the lady out. A manager immediately attends to the couple that was seated right next to them because the woman vomited on their clothing... they were moved to another area. We were asked to move to another area.... but the waiter brought us our food awhile later that had been sitting there- exposed to whatever this woman had been sick with; I wasn't in the mood to touch ANYTHING else on my plate. I wiped my own leg off with a napkin. And I know-- I have sympathy for the woman. I hope she's ok-- but management should have catered to EVERYONE around that area. We told our waiter we were done and he seemed pretty mad and brought us our bill... nobody was concerned that we had just got our meals and hadn't really touched our plates when this happened... just a little concerned that our food was exposed to this woman's vomit and it sat there for 10-15 minutes while everyone cleaned up and they brought us the same plate.  And we ended up paying full price. Just walked out disappointed. And concerned for the staffs knowledge of health hazards.",

The roasted green chile salad with goat cheese and \"crostini\" (this really was a thick slice of bread) was superb. The simple balsamic reduction rounded it all up.

Personally, I'll save my money and travel to Arizona, New Mexico and Texas and eat the real thing. It might actually cost less as well....

Our waitress was fantastic and our food came out at just the right pace.  Food: 5 stars.  The tiger shrimp and sweet potato tamale lived up to its reputation, and the salmon was cooked perfectly and had a delicious mole with a ton of flavor underneath.  The other fish we had was also cooked perfectly although the preparation was less unique (it came on top of crab with edamame, corn and a buttery sauce).  The cornbread and jalepeno bread at the beginning is a nice perk and yummy.  Margaritas: 2 stars.  Bummer!  This is the only part that knocks it down to an overall 4 star experience.  Both margaritas we had (one was a cactus pear, the other was another \"speciality\") were overly sweet, tasted the same, small, and couldn't really taste the tequila.  I was expecting a long list of tasty and inventive margaritas, and instead found a good tequila selection, but nothing more.  If I get the chance to go back, I'll leave the drinking for the casino!",

SPICY CHICKEN SWEET POTATO HASH!!!! sweet, savory, ORGASMIC. yes it was THAT good. the bread basket made me do the happy dance for a good 10 minutes. I think we asked for atleast 3 of these among 2 girls. so f'n good. they even had this awesome jalapeno relish jam ditty to spread on it that was just heavenly. for sides, the grits are just amazing. again, savory and just really really nice. it was my first experience with grits and I was in love.  when I found out there was also one in vegas, I was all over that like a hobo on ham sammich. next vegas trip, I was there for brunch. the spicy chicken sweet potato hash was JUST as good. think of an eggs benedict to the nth power. god, Im getting antsy just thinking about it! the bread basket was just as tasty but they didnt have the jam. oh well. went back ANOTHER time a few months later with a group of 20. raved about the spicy chicken sweet potato hash. about 18 people ordered it and there were smiles all around. this should have stopped here...  ok so the mistake....  COMING FOR DINNER. bleh. friends wanted to check out this place for dinner on the last vegas trip and I must admit after reading the reviews was a bit wary. so here's the lowdown. he has a few amazing standout dishes but everything else is just MEDIOCRE and dull.  cactus pear martini- strong as hell. it was good. not o-m-g but it was good.  black widow mojito- tasty  fresca- this messican koolaid was not too shabby either. definitely stronger than ur average koolaid though =P  bread basket- just so so, not as good as the brunch one but the jalapeno white bread was very tasty. the corn jalapeno muffin thing just crumbles and is a bit dry and tasteless.  appetizers: - mushroom grits with poached egg- ORGASMIC. I swear I would have licked the plate if I could. instead I used the bread to mop it up.  - ceviche sampler- CRAP crap crap.  entrees:  - veal chop- average at best. sauce was meh. it was really just so so. the wild rice tamale that came with it was okay.   - 16 spice duck breast- i HEART duck. the sauce was delicious, they cooked it a good rare plus the way I asked. it was nice but a little tougher than how I like my duck. I would give this dish 3.5-4 stars. the goat cheese chorizo tamale that came with this was just aiiiiiiite.  I liked the duck more than my friend who picked the restaurant initially. she literally just left half of the dish. after the meal, she said she utterly disappointed and PISSED. eep.  the food was meh at best (except the grits). other than the ceviche nothing was really BAD BAD but c'mon for the money and bobby's big ass mouth and cockiness, STEP IT UP!!!! (yeah I said it)  final thoughts:  - stick to brunch. order the spicy chicken sweet potato hash with grits. get on that bread basket as many times as u can!  -  if u ever see grits or any type of poached egg on the menu, GET ON THAT!!!  - bobbly flay is still a cocky ass bastard and although has a few really good dishes, needs to work on the consistency of ALL his dishes. throw down NUTTIN....seriously",

The bf took me here for lunch and although it's a lot more expensive than you would normally pay for lunch, it was very yummy :)  Decor: 4 Service: 5 Food: 4.5  It's located inside Caesars and it's pretty hard to miss since the sign is so big. The decor is cute, a little outdoorsy and casual. Our server was extremely helpful and friendly. He let us know which were more popular and wasn't afraid to tell us which items he didn't like either. Usually, servers just try to sell everything to you so I like that he was honest with us. Overall, the service was great. They always kept our glasses full and we never had to search for them because they just always happened to be there when we needed them haha  We decided to use their fixed menu and chose items off that list. For appetizers we ordered something Blue Pancake and Salmon & Tuna tartar. Personally, I liked the tar tar better than the pancake but my bf loved the pancake more than the tartar. The tartar itself is great but the chips that come with it are someewhat of a fail lol. For entrees we ordered sea scallops and their salmon entree. Both were DELICIOUS. The salmon was cooked realllllly well and the scallops came with avacado, chips, etc. Basically, both were the highlights of the meal, hands down. Lastly, we shared the Vanilla Profiteroles for dessert. I don't know what profiteroles are but it basically looks like a fancy icecream-filled puff to me. Haha either way, it was pretty good and a nice way to finish the meal. I think our meal cost an upward of $80, pretty pricey for lunch but I still thought it was pretty damn good. The Michelin star is well-deserved.",

Ten mins passed, checked with hostess, NOTHING! 15 mins passed and guess what happened, yeap NOTHING!  At that point my husband told the bitch, OOOPS hostess.  \" You either seat us now or else we're leaving and we owe you nothing! \"It's utter B.S. to charge us for a reservation when the restaurant can't keep their end of the bargain. We were seated 5 mins. later!!! THE FOOD We told the waitress to hook us up with their best dishes, their signature items,  what they are known for, so she recomended duck appetizer, shrimp tamale, lamb chop and we split a caesar style salad.. The duck was lukewarm sitting inside a pancake!!! GROSS The shrimp tamale tasted like something you get from costco and microwave, the lamb chop came with sweet and sour sauce & chutneys relish ( indian!!) and was very forgetable! The salad was good!!!  I gave them  2nd star for that ! THE DECOR Wtf- Tomato stickers on glass partitions, 50 identical 2ft high multy colored mexican carafes occupying one whole wall; Bobby Fleys cook books covering the whole front desk area... THE VERDICT Don't make the same mistake we did, don't waste your time or $$$  on this place!",

I'm not surprised that Bobby Flay is so famous, it takes a True chef to pull-off the flavors combinations as done in this restaurant. And for the quality it was affordable, as compared with many other fine dining experiences. Bravo!",

This is not that restaraunt. I ordered the venison. The venison was cooked perfectly. The chipotle sauce served with it was bland. Both needed salt. Along with the venison was a grits tamale it also was tasteless, dry and overcooked. The side dish was delivered 20 minutes after the main dish was served. I was totally disapointed. I was most upset that I brought 4 others who were just as disapointed. Coming from a foodie that Loved Mesa Grill NYC, I would not recommend this Mesa Grill.",

The man knows how to use a blender to create some bold and wonderful flavors.  Like myself - he likes a little heat but not so much that it just overpowers everything.  But something is missing from Mesa Grill.  I think I know what it is.  VALUE.  Look - I know it's not Little Caesar's pizza.  We're not getting 2 large pizzas for $9 or whatever.  But when you order a $12 appetizer and you get like 2 duck tacos to share amongst your table of white collar professionals who are aghast at the appetizer pricing you know something is wrong.  Love the flavor of said duck tacos.  Love the flavor of his tamales.  The masa is just so flavorful!  Unlike any tamale I've had.  But still....even with a nice steak.  The meal just is too expensive for what you get.  This is coming from someone  who has spent $400 for a meal and been happy to do so.  Something is missing but can't express it as well as I'd like.  I may take one for the Yelp team and go there again so I can update this review.  Now it's bugging me....",

    "text": "Solid bold flavors. Now I know what the Iron Chef judges are tasting everytime Bobby Flay steps into Kitchen Stadium. It's hard not to compare this place with Red O, even though the other one is Mexican and this one is Southwest/Tex-Mex, both are well established celebrity chefs. The bread was fresh, one was kind of unique, like a cornbreadish with something else that I couldn't quite figure. It was interesting, but I wasn't sure if I like it or not. Since I was stuff from an earlier buffet, I elected to go with 2 appetizers. The blue corn pancake was their specialty and I could see why. It's an unique dish and the barbecued duck reminded me a little of peking duck. Quite bold flavors, that went well. I also had the spanish chorizo quesadilla with an perfectly cooked egg on top. This dish was bold as well. Not as balanced as the pancake but still pretty good. I also tried my friend's pork chop that I thought was excellently cooked and paired well with the sweet tamale because of the spicy rub on the pork chop. Had I been hungry, I would've ordered this instead. The execution of the dishes were spot on. Overall, I'd give this place 3.6 stars (lowly rounded up to a 4, which could very well be a 3). Maybe my tastebuds have become boring over the years. I just enjoy the simplicity of dishes these days, tasting the ingredients. Bobby Flay proved his himself, but he didn't win me over.",

    "text": "I ate at Mesa Grill about 2 years ago and never wrote anything about it.  So when I was searching for restaurants in Vegas, I came to the realization that I should tell others what happened.  The food was \"ok\" but nothing spectacular. I would eat there again if I wasn't paying the bill. I found it really expensive as is most of Vegas.  I wind up renting a 10 dollar a day car and driving myself to restaurants in the remote parts of town where the locals eat.  Better food, service and value overall and i have been to vegas 5-6 times per year.  The real piss off is the $50.00 per head no show fee.  Get this. They charged my friend's charge card $300.00 for a no show and we DID show. The food went on my card, so they must do a computer matching and did not find a bill under the same name as the reservation.  They would NOT remove it for months.The were not apologetic or anyhing.  We had to fight with them and I had to fax her my receipt to her town (across the country) while she battled this.  I was so embarassed that my good act (to put the tab on my card) was such a debacle.   With all the fancy food techniques I would think a few classes in civility and restaurant management would be better suited for this place.",

We now we're afraid to ask for recommendations or anything because of his rudeness. The gentleman who brought out the appetizer was very helpful and was happy to make a recommendation, which my husband ordered, and even came back to make sure he liked it.

    "text": "Mesa Grill  Mesa Grill was day two on Picky E.'s culinary tour. It was Bobby Flay all the way--there was a corn waffle, a tamale, and plenty of cilantro everything on the menu (and if watch Iron Chef America, you know he always does a corn waffle, a tamale, and his \"signature\" sauces).   I have to say that I was sold--I would highly recommend Mesa Grill. I had the salad that is a riff on a Caesar--it has a Mexican soft and salty cheese instead of parmesan and has these absolutely wonderful riffs on croutons. In fact, the fake croutons are what made the dish for me. If I could have just had a big pile of those, I would have been a very happy camper. I would eat this salad at every meal if I had the chance.  Since it was technically brunch, I had the spicy chicken and hash. It was okay, but not spectacular--the eggs were a little underdone for me and there was a lot of cilantro in the hash (too much in my mind). But, I tasted the steak and eggs that my lunch companion ordered and the steak was amazing. I only wished I had ordered that. So, learn from my mistakes: order the steak and eggs.  The breads that came with the meal where tasty--a corn/blueberry muffin, a cranberry/raisin scone, and a coffee cake; the scone was definitely the best.  Order the salad. Order the steak. Thank me. And, remember, Picky E never recommends a salad unless its unbelievably good.",

A filet that roasts your mouth? I expected to taste a top quality piece of beef nicely complemented by wine. Instead tasted...hot pepper and was that wine? Not sure. It was red but had no chance at coming through after my mouth being blown out by pepper. Weird thing is I like spicy food, this just didn't go with a steak. Not up to the hype or the price tag.

My kids shared an appetizer for an entree, and of course we tasted it.  They had the chicken and black bean quesadilla, and they scarfed it up.  But it was pretty small.  We also ordered the blue corn pancake and barbequed duck, and it was fantastic...but so small.  I had the grilled shrimp tacos and the wife had spicy chicken and sweet potato hash.  Everything was so damn delicious.  Perfect amount of spice and heat.  But alas, the portions were small as well (maybe I'm just too fat).  So we ordered dessert - toasted coconut cake and chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream.  Again, absolutely delicious, and the portions were more \"normal.\"  The meal came out to $123 before taxes, which to me was worth it.  Regarding dress code - I had on shorts and a Charlie Sheen button shirt, and the wife had capris and super casual sandals.  I saw others with t-shirts and shorts, so if there is a code it's pretty lax, at least at lunch.",

    "text": "More like 3.5 stars.  I arrived here for a short layover from the San Antonio conference prior to heading back to California.  I was expecting a lot and my expectations may have influenced the number of stars.  First off, service was excellent.  Our waitress was informative and helpful.  No drinks were unattended for long.  Excellent experience from that standpoint.  Also, the bread basket was excellent too, except for the too crumbly corn bread (?).  Here's what I sampled:  - Gala Apple Salad (Baby spinach, maytag blue cheese, toasted pecans, & a spicy orange vinaigrette - I really enjoyed the salad, I just cannot understand the fascination with some of the cheeses.  I would of loved it sans the blue cheese).  - Blue Corn Pancake (Barbecued Duck & Habanero Chile-Star Anise Sauce - the sauce was nice, but you could seriously have changed the meat to pork and I wouldn't have noticed any difference.  Would have really liked to have tasted the duck).  - Creamy Wild Mushroom Grits (Poached Egg, Charred Serrano Sauce, Cotija Cheese, & Blue Corn Tortilla Crisps - the waitress warned us that these were different grits and they were, but really egg makes a whole lot of stuff better)  - Wild Mushroom Quesadilla (White bean Hummus & White Truffle Oil - I thought it was good, but not great).  For dinner, I had the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin (Bourbon-Ancho Chile Sauce, Sweet Potato Tamale, & Crushed Pecan Butter).  I thought the tenderloin was very well cooked and was pretty tasty.  The Tamale was on the dry side for me, but I'm no tamale aficionado, so take that with a grain of salt.  I also sampled the Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops and thought it was good, although it seemed slightly undercooked for medium rare.  I also tried the Brussels Sprouts which were okay.  To finish, I rushed through the Pineapple Buttermilk Upside Down Cake which was just okay for me.  Nothing special.  I really expected a lot from Bobby Flay's and was kinda disappointed.  I thought the service was really good, but the food just okay.",

    "text": "now I get to be included in hype about getting to eat at one of Bobby Flay's restaurant!!! Thank goodness for Las Vegas - or else maybe it would be a long while before I get to go to New York and try all these famous eats!  We went for brunch and the menu is really simple - 5 appetizers and about 10 entrees. I was on a super, hungry stomach and I wanted EVERYTHING!  The server points out that since it is southwestern cuisine, that everything on the menu is going to have some heat to it. But the menu is made with some sweetness to balance the spicy.  We ordered: Spicy Chicken + sweet potato hash with poached eggs and green chile hollandaise Spicy level from 1-10: 7 Review: presentation was pretty & appetizing, tastes really good - good balance of spicy & creaminess from the sweet potatoes. Just needed a little more crunch for texture.  Scrambled Eggs Chilaquiles - roasted tomatillo sauce, white cheddar cheese, and creme fraiche. Spicy level from 1-10: 3 Review: The best thing we ordered! Presentation wise it was really colorful. The eggs & cheese are layered in between fried blue corn tortillas, and topped with the green sauce and the orange creme fraiche just has a little kick to it. The blue corn was the perfect element in the dish that gave it the perfect texture.",

    "text": "A friend of mine HIGHLY recommended Mesa Grill, so my boyfriend and I checked it out on our recent trip to Vegas. Yeah, our third trip in 5 months...we may have a problem.  Anyway, we went at about 11:30 am on a Saturday, and were seated in about 5 minutes. They happened to be running a special that they run once a year that involved a preset menu with a couple of different options for $30. Not bad.  We ordered the:  Duck served on a blue corn pancake-the duck was DELICIOUS, and both the sauce that the duck was cooked in and the sauce on the plate were delicious. The meat was very tender and flavorful. I am not always crazy about duck, so this was a pleasant surprise   Green Chili Burger with fries-Ok, think big thick burger patty. It was juice and delicious and cooked right to order. My boyfriend often complains that burgers are overdone, even if you ask for them radium rare or medium, and he said this one was just perfect. If you get a chance walk by the grill and look at all of the burgers being cooked.  Sorbet -Mango, Pear, and Raspberry. They were all good but I really liked the nice soft flavor of the pair.  Bread-The bread comes with each table, and I am only mentioned it because it was kind of different. There were several different little selections, such as a cranberry scone, a corn muffin, a coffee cake, and something else sweet. The bread basket was a unique and unexpected touch.  I would definitely come here again. Good food, good service, nice atmosphere and a great location within Caesars.",

    "text": "What a beautiful restaurant with equally beautiful food! I love the chilies in every dish and the unique offerings and great service ensure that Mesa Grill will be a classic even as new restaurants pop up on the strip.  Hubby had the sweet potato and spicy chicken egg dish; I swear his eyes lit up when he took the first bite.The visual presentation matched his look of delight; I've never seen such perfectly cooked eggs! I sampled some of the sweet potatoes (Not a huge egg fan) and found them to be delicious as well. He also ordered a Bloody Mary that is apparently as spicy as it promises to be!  For a foodie, I can be pretty picky, and there wasn't much on the brunch menu that didn't include eggs, save a waffle dish and some sandwiches. I was a little disappointed by this, but I forged ahead and ordered a burger. The burger was good and the fries were also very good. But at the end of the day, as good as it was, I had a burger. Womp womp.  The highlight, for me, was the sweet bread basket that introduced our meal. Jalepeno bread, corn bread, pumpkin bread, fruit scones. I am still dreaming of this bread a day later, I kid you not.  I can easily see where I would have given the Mesa 5 stars had we come for lunch and dinner.",

It also was amazing however a little on the heavy side. For our entree we had the salmon which was divine with a side of the maple bacon. This is a top notch eating establishment.

I ordered the Spicy Bloody Mary, perfection.  Probably the best Bloody Mary I have ever had, it was perfect and not overpowering.    I ordered the Goat Cheese Queso Fundido.  The queso fundido was so good, but I did notice the chips were stale, not crunchy at all, so that was a bit disappointing.  I was going to mention it, but the other people at my table devoured the queso fundido without the chips, so I just left it as is.  We also ordered the Burrata and Grilled Radiccho and that was perfect.  For entrees the table had different ones so we could all taste.  I ordered the Blue Corn Crusted Halibut and it was so delicate and the flavors were so wonderful, I loved it.  I also tasted the Eggs Tostada and Spicy Scrambled Eggs which were also delish with the Cheesy Grits.  I asked the waiter to help me select a dessert and he suggested the Sticky Toffee pudding, which I was not too convinced.  He said I would not be disappointed and he was right.  It was the crowned jewel of my meal.  It was so perfect and amazing.  All in all a fantastic meal.  Bravo.  I have been a fan of Bobby Flay since that Food Network show he had where he cooked for a group of friends and he had a female side kick, this was maybe about 20 years ago.  I waited a long time to eat at one of his restaurants and it did not disappoint.  It was really and incredible experience.",

    "text": "I just read a five star review from a fellow vegetarian for Mesa Grill on the same day we visited. I agree with the yelper that the side corn tamale was average at best, lacked flavor, and really small for $9. Our corn bread that came out before dinner was very dry as well. What I was most dissappointed by was their lack of ability to make a change to an item on the menu.  I wanted to get the quesadillas without chicken that looked amazing and we were told they couldn't do it, that stuff was pre-made. That was a bummer. So we settled for the goat cheese fundido app and a tamale. Like i said the tamale was not so hot and the goat cheese fundido was good. At that point we cut our losses and took off and never got to the chile relleno which I kind of regret based on what other yelper said.   I know this place is mostly a meat type of restaurant but my wife and I love the spice and flavor Mesa brings to the table. For some reason I recall more vegetarian options at the Mesa Grill in New York or maybe they were more willing to adapt.   Their $16 specialty margarita was just ok. Oh, and they could use some customer service training up front. Not so friendly, in a cold and indifferent kind of way. Just annoying when you see them laughing and upbeat with servers but not customers. Oh well, at least our server Arnel was nice.",

We were seated as soon as we arrived, a little early, for our 7 PM reservation.  We were immediately greeted by water service, and our waiter offering me their Marguerita menu - oh my.  An enormous list of tequilas and several margueritas.  I was attracted to the peach and ordered that - it was SOOOO yummy!!  We ordered the Shrimp & Corn Tamale appetizer.  It was very good.  The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the dish was very tasty.  Hubster ordered the Chili Relleno - and the moans from across the table told me that it was very, very good.  It was definitely not your traditional Chili Relleno.  The exterior was crispy, there wasn't a tomato sauce over everything, but there were a couple of colorful sauces on the plate to run your bite through.  The stuffing was eggplant and mechanga cheese - again not a traditional stuffing.  But it was reported to be very, very good.  I wanted something light for dinner, so ordered the Chicken Skewers appetizer.  This came with little tortillas, so you could make little tacos if you wanted, and a peanut sauce.  The chicken was nice and spicy, but not painfully so.  It was a small portion of 3 skewers, which was exactly what I wanted.  I loved the ambiance.  It's a nice warm room, with warm southwest colors and a copper hood over the kitchen.  The kitchen was behind glass, and you could see the chefs at work, which I love.  We had seen a show on the Food Channel about the development of this restaurant, so it was really fun to see it in person.    I would definitely eat here again, there were several things on the menu that I would like to try.",

    "text": "FULL DISCLOSURE: I watch Food Network, I enjoy Iron Chef, and some might consider me a \"Foodie\" (of course, I got super-excited about the Doritos Locos Taco at Taco Bell, so take that for what you will).  FOOD: I have been here twice now and both times have been excellent, easily within the top 3 meals I've ever tasted. The most wonderful thing there that I put in my face was the mushroom-fontina quesadilla, which was topped with ricotta, salsa verde, a fried egg, and garnished with cilantro. IT IS AMAZING. I've also tasted the Chorizo Meatballs - why is this not a full entree with pasta?; the ribeye - So much flavor; the filet mignon - it just melts in your mouth; the Yucatan Chicken Tacos - grilled chicken, grilled, onions, mint, cilantro, and a delicious peanut chile BBQ sauce; the roasted corn side dish - just wow. I've also had some other previous sides and appetizers from my previous visit, which were all extremely tasty. Oh!, and the bread basket they bring to the table has a jalapeno cheese bread, raisin molasses (I think), and a spicy cornbread muffin.  DRINKS: I've had a couple tequila and whisky based cocktails, and all were great. This last time I had a rye whiskey cocktail that had champagne and orange peel, which was one of the better whiskey drinks I've had.  SERVICE: Attentive and professional.",

I had friends in town from back home in the Pacific NW and we were well on our way to Ellis Island, which is RIGHT around the corner from their hotel (Tuscany)...I was dreaming of the BBQ when Vern told me this is Rob's first trip to Vegas...well, HELL NO, we're heading to Caesars Palace to get this party started right.  Did I mention I started working there a week ago?  No?  My bad...I get a discount on restaurants there so I asked my friends if they have ever heard of Mesa Grill?  Nope...   Do they watch the food network ?\" and you can see the  lights starting to come on...\"Yes!\"  They know Bobby Flay...it's tough to get to the sensitive side of bomb disposal guys but I managed...  I called around 5:30 PM on Sunday, last night, and asked for reservations within 30 minutes.  The very nice lady who answered the phone had a place for us in 45 minutes.  Sweet!  Gave us some time to check out the new pool, show them where the Seven Stars Diamond Lounge is located, check out the pics of Joe Namath standing on the sidelines with Bear Bryant, and Mohammad Ali knocking out Sonny Liston.... We arrived to a team of four standing in the elegantly adorned entry.  The place is SEXY.  Note to self, bring date here!  Big smiles from the Hostess.  Felt very welcome and warm fuzzies all over.  :~)  We were about 20 minutes early and wanted to get a drink, but they sat us immediately.  The place was packed with smartly dressed people, all having their taste buds do the Snoopy Dance as they dined on incredible looking foods.  Just beautiful presentations all around.    We're seated at a table for 4; two chairs and a booth like seating with nice cushions and a wonderful view of the entire restaurant from back to front.  I let my visiting friends have the luxurious view since I wanted this to be a special and memorable event for them.  It's like stadium seating where there is the ground floor seating...  (had written a much more entertaining review two weeks ago when I went  but my #$^%%$$ ^%$#!@ wireless kicked me OUT!!!  I'm okay now but do apologize if this segment of the review lacks luster)  I've since forgotten the names of our incredible Wait Person, and her entourage, but we got kiss butt service, everything was explained, they were professional without being stuffy, helpful, knowledgeable and supportive of our choices, without saying, \"that's my favorite\"... I can't be that lucky or I had better go buy a lotto ticket.  I digress...not about me...  Take a peek at the pic and those pics SHOUT a thousand words about how amazing this place is.  Get ready to have your taste buds do the happy dance.  Chow!",

For the entree, I ordered the grilled lamb chops, and they literally melted in my mouth. Everthing came in excellent timing.

I'd give it a 3, she gives it a 5... so we agreed to split it down the middle.  Its not that the food or service or anything was bad, its just spicy... really spicy.  Everything is spicy!  My mouth was burning after each bite.    Just to start, I decided since it was a south west style restaurant, I would get a tequila.  The poor was tiny.  I mean, it was a shot in a large glass... kinda disappointing.  For the food, the wife got the Sweet Potato soup...  She loved it, but thought it was spicy (needed a few extra glasses of water).  I shared the apps with the rest of the family.  Tiger shrimp was very good.  Blue corn pancake was excellent!  Meatballs were just ok.    For dinners, the wife got the Relleno.  She loved it (as did her brother who said it was the best plate on the table).  I had the Pork Tenderloins.  Interesting presentation, good flavor, but it completely overpowered the pork.  It could have been anything with the spices on it, and tasted the same.    For dessert, we got the churros.  Not so great.  Sauces were good, but the churros were nothing you couldn't get from a vendor at Disney.    Atmosphere is great.  Service was right on spot, but as I said, food was a little disappointing for me.",

The service was very good, the food okay,as the portion are small for the price(on appetizers). My lamb chop was peppery, and lack a little flavor,, did not care for the brown sauce drizzle around it. I tried my friend's scallops, it was yummier.... The white peach margaritas were great, would of had a few more , but not at $14 ea,, maybe they need to sell it cheaper by a pitcher...I loved, the tiger shrimp tamale,, yummy-o.. Dessert were top notch, tasty.. Yes we had to order a couple of the tiger apps and blue pancake with duck,as all apps are only one on plate, if you are sharing a taste, more than a bite, the price adds up $$$$..",

The food was priced like a Morton's Steakhouse but not up to the standards.  The side dishes were small, not very good, and not well executed.  The entrees were prepared well, however the price is not worth it.  In my opinion I would skip over this place and go off the strip to a non tourist trap that is much better food, and much nicer environment.  The decor of this place is that of a TGI Fridays with a slightly more classy twist.  I have dined in a lot of find dining establishments and this did not meet my expectations in the least.  The $13 margaritas on the rocks tasted like it came from mix not made from scratch.    Also to make a reservation for a Saturday night party of 5 took 2 managers to approve and an act of congress.",

As always, on the weekend nights in Las Vegas, it and everywhere else was packed. I was lucky enough to find a place at the bar. The bartender was good and so was the cactus pear blossom margarita. Actually one of my all-time favorites. However the 2 appetizers I ordered were laughably SMALL!   I had their famous Lobster Tacos and the Tiger Prawn Tamale. The tamales were good, the tacos were so tiny that I couldn't tell if there was lobster meat or just the \"essence of lobster\" in them. They were both more like an amuse bouche than an appetizer.   Tacos $20  Tamales $15   estimated weight 3 ozs. total ... if that. Tamales were tasty. The tacos were too small to register taste. After 1 drink and tax the tab was $53. $10 tip = $63   I doubt that I'll give it a second try for entrees.  The VALUE was a joke as far as I was concerned.  Thankfully the food court was right next door so I didn't have to sit thru the show hungry :)",

Overall, the experience was quite disappointing. My wife ordered a steak and was very specific and emphatic regarding how she wanted it prepared, but the waiter decided on his own to adjust the instructions to the kitchen to what he thought was appropriate. The result was an undercooked steak, relative to my wife's very specific instructions. My selection of rabbit with risotto was good, but nothing extraordinary. Our overall experience was \"so-so\" food, not prepared to our request, and very high prices. There are far better places in Las Vegas. We will not be back to Mesa Grill.

Everything we ordered was fantastically presented and well prepared. Notables were the bread basket, the shrimp tamale appetizer, the wild mushroom quesadilla with truffle oil, and my favorite, the roasted corn side dish. The rib eye is a monstrosity of a steak and definitely big enough to share. And the butterscotch flan for dessert? Perfection.   Overall, the food was good... the only drawback to Mesa, for me, was the fact it's smack in the middle of the Caesars Palace casino floor and you can totally smell clouds of cigarette while you eat which is a huge turn off for me.",

No sooner had we landed in the firey furnace of hell (aka Vegas) then we dashed into Caesar's and were promptly seated at a spacious table at the Mesa Grill.  The complimentary bread basket is like your own private bakery chock full of muffins and rolls and bread sticks and bread...made of different textures and colors of corn and whole grains. I loved the blue corn muffins so much that I ate my husband's and my brothers-in-law's and was tempted to creep my fingers over to the next table and swipe theirs too!  My husband ordered iced tea which arrived with a tiny glass decanter of simple syrup with which to sweeten it--but don't think they limited your selection to the simple syrup---they also offered all sorts of natural sugars and artificial sweeteners!  I go to nice places on occasion but I can't think of the last time I was so impressed with small details!   I felt like some kind of hillbilly!  I ordered the fresh fish of the day which was tasty although I don't really remember it as much as the shrimp tamale my husband ordered.  I can hardly wait to go back to Vegas to have another one of those for myself!  One of my brothers-in-law ordered the blue corn buttermilk waffle with blackberry bourbon syrup and vanilla creme fraiche.  I have to say that it was delicious, but it was fourteen dollars, and compared to the other entrees we had at our table with meat and fresh seafood was comparatively priced--therefore overpriced.  I mean a waffle.  For fourteen bucks.  My other brother-in-law ordered the chilaquiles.  Which were also very flavorful and complex.    I had never had blue corn before so I bought some Bob's Red Mill blue cornmeal on Amazon and have begun to experiment.  Not quite ready for a Bobby Flay throwdown, however.",

We could only afford to do a couple of the celebrity chef restaurants, and scheduled this for a nice lunch on our last day in Vegas.  I am sad to say that the food did not live up to the prices or the hype.  i had a chicken and avocado quesadilla that was overcooked and something I could have easily made myself at home.  My wife had the yucatan chicken tacos, which were three TINY tacos and again nothing special.   We each drank non-alcoholic drinks and the bill came to over $40 for sub-par food.  (As a side note, we love a good meal and are not afraid to spend a lot of money for truly quality food, but this was not hte case.)  A couple of positive points to note:  the atmosphere and space is quite nice and a quiet respite inside the Caesar's casino.  I also suspect their cocktails are quite tasty, as is their signature appetizer the Queso Fundido.  However, our experience was quite poor.  It's likely a better visit if Mr. Flay is in the kitchen when you happen to be there, but on a whole, I would leave this one off of your list of places to visit.  Vegas is full of some of the country's BEST restaurants in terms of food and service.  Spend your money elsewhere.",

    "text": "Been to Vegas twice in the last year and have eaten here four times. I love it here! The staff is amazing!  I even saw the young hostess(probably 17years old)  very carefully and professionally deal with a drunk obnoxious man demanding to be seated w/o a reservation.  Funnier was when he pulled out his Caesars player card and showed it to her like that had clout!  The look on the hostess face was fricken priceless!  You could tell she wanted to laugh him right out of the place but she very politely explained she would seat him as soon as all the reservations had been seated first. I gleaned this was not the first time she had said this to him.  I digress... We got seated, we had reservations, and the waiter was punctual and informative.  I have found the staff recommendations are some of the best.  I have yet to be disappointed. The menu changes every 6 months which is great!  It's never the same food when I return! I've had the steak, the blue corn pancake, the green apple salad, the venison and the queso fundido.  The food is always fresh hot and packed with just the right flavors.  The spices are so perfect that I don't even use salt! Now that's saying something for me!    It's a great place to have a fairly reasonably priced mean in Vegas and still be able to talk to your company.    The staff checks on you enough to make sure you are happy but not so much that you feel like you have an extra person in your party. And they have never come by when I have just taken a huge bite of food! They actually want to hear what you say about the food!   Some other things I liked about this place is the consistency of food, customer service and clean bathrooms! A huge plus!",

    "text": "If at any point during a meal I start calculating the costs because I don't feel it's justified, it's probably not worth it.   I had my reservations about dining at Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill inside Ceasar's Palace. The idea of a \"fine dining\" experience featuring \"Southwestern cuisine\" seemed like an oxymoron. I could not fathom how this particular genre of food would be successfully executed at an elevated level, because quality Tex-Mex ingredients are not expensive, rare, or difficult to prepare. I've been to local mom and pop restaurants in New Mexico and Texas that served fantastic and memorable chili relleno's, taco's, salsas with roasted chili's, creamy black beans, spiky queso fresco (sp?), and fresh blue corn tortilla's made by hand. Putting an ancho chili spice rub on a pork loin just doesn't seem to justify the price tag.   A friend of mine dined at Mesa Grill, and so enjoyed his experience he requested a visit on our upcoming Vegas trip. I trusted his palate considering he is a product of culinary school, but I should've considered his admiration for chef Flay might sway his better judgement.   Mesa Grill is right around the corner from Pure nightclub, (which I suggest attending, you'll have a great time). The decor is quite loud, but I must say A+ for the grill design on the ceiling. Clever.   The staff. Our waitress seemed flighty. She might have been new, so I'll excuse her erratic behavior. First, she forgot our bottled water, then proceeded to argue with us that we did not request bottled. I don't mind if you forget our water preference, but to argue with us is ridiculous. Then she forgets to inform us of the specials. We overheard the specials from the waiter serving the table next to us. When she came back with our water, we informed her that we wanted hear the specials. Again, she argues with us and tells us she already told us. \"So all four of us are lying?\" I asked. She then told us to \"hold on\" as she double checked the specials. Interesting, considering she claims she had already informed us. Nonetheless, one of our friends ordered the special seared scallop dish with a chili orange glaze.   The drinks. My friend ordered a mango mojito that was nice and refreshing. I ordered a kir royale. They used Chambord instead of cassis, which I didn't love, because I tasted the liquor as opposed to the sweet, tangy cassis.   The food. We opted to start with the spiced duck taco's, queso fresco dip with blue corn tortilla chips, and deep fried squash blossoms stuffed with ricotta cheese, and basil. The duck taco's were savory, but reminded me of a Peking duck dish served at one of my favorite Chinese restaurants. Unoriginal. Tortillas stuffed with duck, a plum flavored sauce, cilantro, green onions, and shredded cabbage. The queso dip wasn't horrible. It was a cheese dip with chips. Not really interesting. The squash blossoms were crunchy, but the ricotta and basil were a little too assertive for my taste. I lost the flavor of the blossoms in the goop of the ricotta.  The basil was a little too sharp.   Aside from our one friend, we all ordered the coffee spiced filet, with a corn tamale, and horseradish potato gratin. The filet was cooked perfectly, and the coffee spiced rub wasn't bad. Although, I like to taste my meat. I am a violent carnivore, and I love ripping into a juicy, bloody, fatty, piece of meat. I know, its an illness. In hindsight I probably shouldn't have ordered the spiced rubbed meat, but I needed to decide for myself if spiced meat was a delicious option. Unfortunately, not so. The spices in the rub didn't compliment the meat, as much as it overpowered it. The spices failed to dissipate, so I cleared my palate after every bite. The horeradish potatoes were good, and the corn tamale was nice and moist, but like every other corn tamale I've had at any generic Mexican restaurant. For dessert we ordered an exotic sorbetto Napoleon: Guava, passionfruit, and mango sorbetto, with a carmel crisp. Yummy.   I walked away from my experience feeling ripped off. I wasn't impressed. As a professional digester I never look at prices. It's insulting to the food. Sadly, I wanted my money back. I felt cheated. I want to walk away from a meal feeling satiated, not calculating the costs.   Side note: My uncle wanted to celebrate his birthday at Mesa Grill, and to our surprise, and luck, Chef Flay was in the kitchen. He came out to greet the patrons, and was very nice. He patiently chatted with my 89 year-old grandma, as she professed her love for him, and was kind enough to take a picture with her. He asked if the food was to our liking, then sent over a signed cookbook. I may not agree with his culinary vision, but I respect him for what he has achieved, and his compassion for his patrons.",

After sampling the best tamale I have ever had, a, shrimp tamale with a luscious cream sauce, the dinner went straight downhill.  A 22 oz bone-in ribeye did not have the customary Vegas char for a medium-rare that I have gotten used to in this great steak town.  While I could live with that, the relish served pepper relish served on the steak and the ancho and chimichurri sauce served on the plate were cold.  The twice baked potato was mediocre and the pear upside down cake was easily forgotten.  Not worth the price.",

Besides the bartender who gave me major attitude for asking for sugar free Redbull (after pouring 2 guys' to-go cups of beer into rocks glasses for them, I didn't think my request was such a big deal) our experience was great. Mmmm cactus pear margarita.  The bread basket was really yummy, I actually couldn't stop eating it!! For starters, I had the sweet potato soup. Oh my god. My husband had the tacos and he had food envy for sure. Tacos were definitely delicious but TINY!! 3 of them could be eaten in 6 bites or less. The soup was absolutely incredible with the maple cream and marcona almonds...highly recommend. We shared the romaine salad, very good and not overdressed. Yummy cheese crisp in the middle.  I had the filet mignon for dinner, perfectly medium rare and very very yummy. Spicy chipotle coating, which was not overpowering. Husband had the pork tenderloin - then it was my turn for food envy - wow. Extremely delicious, the sauce was to die for. Coconut cake for dessert, skip it. It was totally dry and tasteless. I was very sad because I love coconut cake. Eh. Would definitely go back! As an FYI, most of the recipes that the restaurant uses are in Bobby Flay's cookbook...I'll be picking that up soon so I can make that soup. Mmmmm. I'm still dreaming about it.",

For desserts we got churros and chocolate, banana cream pie and chocolate corn bread pudding. They were all delicious, but the chocolate pudding was probably the best dessert of the night.

    "text": "Right off the bat I have to say I screwed up when I ordered.  We were trying to decide on an app and the waiter kept telling us how popular the queso fundido was.  I'm not a huge fan of queso fundido.  I love cheese, but I just find QF to be too much cheese usually.  Somehow I got sucked up into the hype of the queso and out it came.  It was good.  It was the best QF I ever had.  It had goat cheese in it and peppers on top.  But in the end it was queso fundido and I tired of it before half of it was gone.  I had the smoked shrimp tacos.  The shrimp were perfectly cooked.  The tacos were served with 3 salsas: avocado, mango and tomatillo.  I put all the salsas on my tacos and they tasted great together.  So why only 3 stars?  Well the queso thing, but that's my own fault.  Those shrimp tacos were 20 something bucks, for 6 shrimp, some slaw, 2 tortillas, and salsa.  I can get a whole meal of tacos that are just as good from a truck down the street for $7. The GF had a spiced pork tenderloin and ( I don't mean to toot my own horn, but... ) I have seriously made better pork tenderloin sandwiches at home from leftovers.  And the fries were limp and all bits and pieces.  I really wanted to love Mesa Grill.  Mexican and Southwestern foods are my favorites.  But I just felt like it didn't live up to the hype.  Maybe I went in with my expectations way too high.  Fair enough, and again my fault.  But I just didn't feel like I got my money's worth.  I am going to stick with my neighborhood taqueria.",

It was cooked to perfection and had a really nice pepper rub that must have left a crust an inch thick.  If you're not into peppery crusts, then you might find the cow at this place not to your liking.  Anyway, the steak was great, the desserts were yummy, the side dishes were  average (as all sides seem to be in Vegas), the ambiance was not bad, and I can't remember what I had to drink during the meal.  As for the service, we had to wait a bit past our reserved time but the waitstaff performed in a prompt and satisfactory manner.  (That sounds kinda dirty, doesn't it?)  The restaurant was definitely crowded and loud, though.  Can't win 'em all, but I sure can deduct a star here and there...!",

We didn't have a reservation and had to wait about an hour for a table but they took us in right away for bar seating, where you are served full menu.  We shared chopped salad, wild mushroom quesadilla, 22 oz bone-in rib-eye and a side of cilantro mashed potato.  Everything was sooo good.  Chopped salad was ok but I could have done without.  Mushroom quesadilla was really good, very earthy and had great sauce to go with it.  The highlight of the night was the ribeye.  Cooked perfectly medium rare, juicy and I just could not get enough of the red and green chile sauce that came with it.   Mesa's food is very flavorful and has lot of depths to each dish.  Cocktails were also really good.  And on top that, sitting at the bar, the bartender gave us taste of other left over cocktails from other patrons....yay!  Lastly, we ordered blackberry-mango crostada, which was heavenly.  My husband, who normally lets me eat most of the dessert was so impressed by it that I had to fight to get my share of the dessert.  Overall, Mesa Grill met my long awaited expectation and delivered even more.  Will definitely come back.",

    "text": "B-Flay has definitely got it goin ON! If your going to stay in Vegas, you need to make it a priority to visit this restaurant. The food if just amazing.  I ordered the duck with a carrot and habenero sauce, and please do not be afraid of the almighty pepper. It was mild. The duck was cooked to perfection, it melted in your mouth. The tamale that is served along side it was dry, and odd combo. It was a goat cheese, chorizo tamale. Just order the corn, you will want to eat gallons of it. Keep the tamale do NOT ask to substitute, pet PEEVE of any chef. Its a major no no.  My friend had the salmon with black bean puree, with garnish of cilantro, the salmon was good medium rare and it was juicy, flaky and extremely flavorful. The ingredients used in all of his recipes are fresh and full of flavor.  Another person ordered the chicken, chicken is boring to order at restaurants cause it can be over cooked, bland, or dry. However B-Flay knew how to master that chicken! It was crispy skinned, juicy succulent meat, and the most mouth watering crust. It had a bite as well as a smokey flavor through out the dish. The chicken was served along side mashed potatoes with cilantro pesto. TO DIE FOR I tell you, now if you were like me you were thinking cilantro in mashed potatoes, dont question just eat. Trust me!  As for drinks, dont be afraid to ask the server what he recommends for your drink give him an idea of what you like, what food you might order and man do they know their stuff.  I had a white peach margarita that was sensational. Hold the salt too please. The white peach was actually a white peach no fake stuff, this was the real deal. The color looked like an ending sunset, garnished with a lime and served in a cute glass.  For dessert i did not order one but I did however have a dessert drink. It was a passion fruit Bellini. Completed the meal and tied all the flavors together while cleaning my pallet.  As for the service, I have never received such great service. I say this because in Vegas, serves were rude, short, inexperienced and didn't know the menu. B-Flay has got his workers TRAINED! We were wearing black dresses and were given white napkins, they removed them and said, \"Ladies we want to give you black ones so you dont get lint on your dresses,\" Thank you B-Flay. Thank you serves for having your shit together and knowing how to treat guests. Five stars all around.",

Maybe it is because I am used to dining in far-less quality, digs, however the service was exceptional. Three of us ladies out for the night. After some advice from our neighboring diners, we started with the Queso Fundido (or something like that) and I could not stop eating it. It was so delicious and it was the perfect thing to start with. I ordered the Corn-Meal Chile Relleno and my friends had the Chicken and Black Bean Quesadilla and the Ancho-Chile Salmon (delicious, but a few bones :( As good as the main entrees were, and they were GREAT, the side dishes were the main attraction. The Roasted Corn with Chile and Cotija cheese was literally the reason why I will come back. The Chorizo Tamale was to die for as well. Since we were on a girls night, we also ordered the Pinot Noir which from the advice of our server, was a perfect accompaniment to our meal.   Overall, this restaurant lives up to its name, and I will not only return every time I am back in Vegas, but I have recommended it to so many.  Keep up the exceptional work.",

Had there not been 5 empty tables around us it wouldn't have been a problem! Felt rushed and not important!",

Since it was a group of us and we wanted to try a little of everything we did family style (I don't think is typical thing here but they were accommodating). We got the rabbit, 16 spice chicken, Maui and rib eye steak...all flavorful with my favorites being the chicken and rib eye. The service was on point. You must check this place out!",

The goat cheese fondue was delicious and the flavors were well seasoned and balanced, the chicken black bean quesadilla was dry and not very flavorful. The bread basket was nothing special and the jalapeno muffins fell apart way too easy.  The Chile relleno was tasty but the crust was mediocre and not very appetizing, the sixteen spice chicken was good and the mashed potatoes were amazing.  Certainly not a bad restaurant; but at the price your paying you could do better.",

She replied yes we have a 7 pm reservation. They had 6 empty tables around us. My wife had 1/4 glass of her wine left. Pretty disappointed that mgmt rushes a table like that.

We were fully prepared for a high priced, high quality meal with great service. Let's be honest food is food, so we expected the environment we were paying for. Very underwhelming.  The atmosphere was bland. The waiter was not friendly at all. He had no table presence. He got straight to work taking orders and wasn't accommodating to questions. The water/drink waiters were so nice and attentive. The waiter ask about dessert pretty much as soon as we started eating and when we declined, brought the check before we even finished.  Guess he had somewhere to be. The food was good however soooo spicy. No one cleaned their plates at our table. One girl had the baked potatoes and LOVED it. All in all I won't go again and I think my other 7 peeps would say the same.",

    "text": "This restaurant is on the Strip inside of Caesar's Palace so it does take some time to park and walk through the casino to get to it, but that is to be expected when eating on the Strip. We arrived 15 minutes before our reservation, party of 3. They seated us right away, without a moment of waiting. The hostess seated us and promptly our server arrived to let us know about the menu and the drink specials. He was very knowledgeable about the menu - able to tell us customer favorites and his own personal favorites.  We ordered the Tiger Shrimp + Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale as an appetizer. It was positively delicious. At $19.00, you only get 4 shrimp, but that is to be expected as a higher end restaurant on the Strip. The sauce was divine as they provided complementary bread with butter. We dipped the bread into the leftover sauce from the shrimp and tamales. It was perfect! There were three different types of bread that they provided - 3 slices of jalapeno bread, 2 cornbread muffins and 3 slices of raisin bread. The jalapeno bread was soft with a touch of heat that went so well with both the softened butter they provided and the leftover sauce. The muffins were ideally crumbly and buttery. We could have done with more of the jalapeno bread and less of the raisin - it didn't quite hold weight compared to everything else we ate. My companions ordered the cactus pear margaritas on the rocks and raved about the flavor and that they did not skimp on the tequila in the slightest.  For the entree, I order the Cornmeal Crusted Chile Relleno. The filling was of perfectly cooked mushrooms and the chile's crust was thin by extremely crispy. There was a sweet red pepper sauce with what appeared to be cotija cheese lightly sprinkled on top - I could have used a bit more of the cheese but otherwise the entree is definitely a contender for the next time we dine here. My husband ordered the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin. This consists of three pork medallions with a spicy crust - our server said it rates at about a 6/10. It was too spicy for me, but a nice heat according to my husband. My friend ordered the Ancho Chile-honey Glazed Salmon. The crust from the spices on the fish was a delightful contrast to the buttery texture of the fish, which flaked apart with the fork - perfectly cooked. My friend ordered a side of Double Baked Potato, which was the only thing that I wouldn't order again. There was nothing special about this twice baked potato, which I would expect something better from Bobby Flay's restaurant.   Overall, the service was excellent, the food was delicious and I would definitely recommend this to other people when visiting the strip. The price is exactly what I would expect for the quality of food, minus the potato.

My partner had the tuna tartare nachos, and I had the spicy chicken and sweet potato hash with poached eggs and green chile hollandaise.   Both were delicious, beautifully plated, and arrived quickly. Was impressed enough to splurge on dessert, and took the server's recommendation for the deconstructed banana cream pie.   Obviously, tequilas and margaritas are a specialty, but its worth noting that the beer and whiskey selections available are obviously well curated to go with the restaurant's flavor profile and high quality.",

Portions were a bit on the smaller portion scale for the $$$ prices on the menu so doing family style might not be ideal.  The only thing we didn't like was one of the sides - spinach rossito because of the cheese they put in made it very salty. The waiter was nice enough to replace it with mashed potato. The service was decent but they forgot to bring extra bowls even though they weren't too busy.",

My experience at Mesa Grill last night can confirm, it really is actually amazing!  I had a quick dinner, so my review is based on one item. However, that item blew me away enough to run to Yelp and share my experience. I had the smoked chicken quesadilla, which was actually out of this world.   The size itself was pretty small, but unlike your average small quesadilla, was still packed with gooey cheese and chicken where you can actually taste the smokiness in each bite. The guacamole, creme fraisse and roasted garlic shavings ensured that every bite was absolutely loaded with flavor. I even believe the tortilla itself was sprinkled with some smoky, chipotle magic. I was in heaven every moment until my last bite.  I do have one quip though: I ordered a glass of cab with my quesadilla, and when the bill came I noticed it was only ONE DOLLAR less than my meal- pardon? The waitress (bartender in my case) explained that it was their only glass of cab, that's why it was 16 dollars. Would have liked to have been warned I would be paying virtually the same thing for my meal, but whatever. For the best quesadilla of my life, I'll cut my losses.",

I have never dined at any of Bobby Flay's restaurants and this was my first one. I have to say the food was okay nothing great or worth the price. The service on the other hand was excellent and they were on top of everything without being intrusive.   I think I will try Bobby's other restaurants to see if the food is better.",

    "text": "Mesa Grill is definitely a restaurant you need to experience in Las Vegas. This Bobby Flay restaurant is located inside of Caesars Palace. The Restaurant seating is an open spaced floor plan and has  a nice warm Southwestern feel. We came here during Restaurant Week so  I was hesitant on how long the wait would be. To my surprise we got seated right away! Instantly I was pleased as I am not a very patient person when it comes to waiting for a seat.   My first dish I tried was the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin with a Bourbon and Ancho Chile Sauce and a Sweet Potato Tamale with Crushed Pecan Butter. All I can say is Heaven. It was amazing. I am always nervous to try pork dishes as it is my favorite type of meat and I hold it to a very high standard. This was the best pork dish I have ever had. Tender, juicy and the mix of spices took me on a wild tasty ride!   The next dish I tried was the Tiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale with Corn in a Cilantro Sauce. Oh my goodness. I was blown away! The mix of the sweet corn, butter and cilantro sauce was paired so nicely with the shrimp that I ate the whole thing! I couldn't put the fork down it was just too delicious.  The shrimp was huge and the portion of this dish was perfect! I would have never paired shrimp with corn before but am looking forward to finding a way to make this recipe at home.  Another dish I recommend is the Ancho Chile Honey Glazed Salmon with Spicy Black Bean Sauce and Roasted Jalapeno Crema. I was hesitant to order something with black bean sauce as I have never heard of anything like that before. I am glad I took the jump and tried something new! I was totally impressed with the flavors from the jalapeno crema, the salmon and the black bean sauce.  I had such a great experience my first time at Mesa Grill that I have been back numerous times since. When you visit Las Vegas make sure to make Mesa Grill a priority on your \"to do\" list. You will not be disappointed, I guarantee it!

I loved their roasted corn soup, smoked chicken & black bean quesadilla, and the dish that has rabbit meat in it ( I forgot what it called).  I think that the ancho chile -honey glazed salmon was just average.   So, if you have a chance to dine there, don't order the salmon dish.    Overall, the ambiance is nice, the price is on a higher side, and the waiter is helpful and attentive.",

Appetizer - blue corn duck.  WOW.  SO good!  I got the pork tenderloin sandwich with southwestern fries, and it was fantastic.  My husband got the grouper.  This is where the star got lost.  Not only did they originally bring the wrong thing, but when they finally did bring out the grouper dish, it was suspiciously undercooked in the middle, which unfortunately led to some stomach issues later on for poor hubs :(  They didn't take it off our bill, or even offer any sort of discount, and hubs had to wait a good 10 minutes for his dish to arrive while I ate my lunch.  Bad, bad, bad.  It's tough....I had a great food experience, but I'm knocking off a star because of the grouper incident.",

I liked the corn/jalapeno cheesy bites and the blueberry coffee cake the best, but my husband really liked the chocolate things and the cornbread muffins. I ordered the chilaquiles, which were to die for. SO SO good. Layers of corn tostada with a green sauce and eggs and cheese with a swirl of a red sauce on top. I didn't have room for the breakfast potatoes, but my husband liked them. He had the blue corn waffle with mango bacon and loved it.",

Mesa Grill is easy to find in it's central location in the middle of the casino and with it's vibrant colors pouring out.   The staff was very professional and friendly. We were seated almost instantly and took in the surroundings - very eclectic and energetic decor. Opening the menu, there is a lot to choose from. I myself ordered the duck with the chile rilleno on the side, and the man decided to try the halibut with a side of mashed potatoes. And, of course - there were Margaritas. We just ordered the classic version on the rocks...  ...I can't rave enough about them. DELICIOUS! I could have had about 5 more. However, being in Vegas, one has to pace themselves.   After a scrumptious bread bowl, the food came. Presentation was fantastic, and the taste even better.  My duck was some of the best I've ever had - savory, spicy, juicy. The homemade tamale on the side was delish and the chile rilleno - I died. ORDER THIS EXACT MEAL.   All in all - ambiance was A+. Drinks were A+. Food was A+. Enjoy!",

(The waiter offered me something to drink, but I'm not yet 21...meep). The best appetizer is easily the queso fundido, although the wild mushroom quesadillas and the pumpkin soup (I'm not sure if it's a seasonal addition or not) are amazing as well.   I always get the chile relleno, because it's the only vegetarian main dish. However, it's soooo good that I don't care that I don't have any other option. It's filled with manchego cheese and eggplant, which is awesome because I absolutely love manchego cheese, but I kind of liked the dish better when it was filled with goat cheese and zucchini. Oh yeah, and I've heard great things about the steak.  Desserts are good, as well, however not nearly as good as the main courses and appetizers. The last time I was here, I had the apple cider cake. The vanilla creme fraiche ice cream it came with was very good, but sadly, the cake was a little on the dry side.   I also love that there's a cookbook with all the recipes for this restaurant. Genius!",

And For the first time, I kind of wished I had two stomachs, just so I could eat some more of his food!  I ordered the special, the Rabbit and pea risotto.  Sounds odd but  it was absolutely GREAT!  The bread they give us was not good, but hey, it's complimentary so I am not mad =]  We went in as a party of 8, and our server was very polite, attentive & helpful.

We started with the Spanish Chorizo Quesadilla, which was amazing! Haven't had anything like it before. For my entree, I had the halibut, which was also good, but somewhat dry/overcooked (which was actually fine by me, since I like my fish done well).  I had made a reservation, but we still had to wait about 15 minutes for a table. There were a lot of tables open, but people coming in without reservations were told there was a 2 hour wait. I'm not sure if they were understaffed or what the case was. I also thought our server wasn't very attentive. It was more us waiting for him, than him waiting on us.  I'd recommend Mesa Grill for the food and ambience, but hope that the service improves!",

His food isn't too heavy on the sauces, butter, o.o. and he proved us right at this wonderful restaurant.   Anyway, for my 2nd year wedding anniversary, I booked the MESA Grill at Caesar's in Vegas to celebrate (before we went next door to the Mirage to see The Beatles:LOVE by Cirque du Soleil, which was another 5-star performance).  We ordered the \"rough cut tuna tartar with mango hot sauce and avocado cream\" appetizer, as well as Yucatan chicken tacos with spicy peanut smoked bbq sauce and fresh mint and cilantro. For main, we split the veal chop recommended by our attentive server, and that came with a wild rice tamale filled with sage butter. We added a side of cornmeal-crusted Anaheim chile relleno with white cheddar, beans and rice. And for dessert, there were a few that we wanted to get but ended up with the sampler of warm chocolate cake with toasted pecan ice cream, smoked vanilla walnut flan with coffee caramel & bourbon-soaked banana cakes, and peach & blackberry shortcake with champagne blackberry sorbet.   The food was amazing and our server was just as amazing which made everything such a pleasant experience. The front desk host/hostesses (there were 3) were not as much but our server, I think was Michael, was not intrusive but informative and such a professional.   So I now have a much better opinion of Bobby Flay for having the staff that he has, both inside and outside the kitchen, who are able to sell not only his food but the entire dining experience.",

Back last night and the food was just as awesome.....Mesa Grill gets it RIGHT!  For once, a restaurant where the portions are equal to the $35-$50 entree prices, but more importantly, the quality, flavor, and execution far surpasses it.    BRILLIANT: -Bread/Muffin basket.  Says volumes about a restaurant when they put so  much care in their nibbles.  My fav of the 4 different bread types was the blue corn muffin.  Dab of butter and you're done. -Honey Glazed Salmon.  Spiced and cooked to a perfect medium rare as requested.  Served on top of a yummy black bean puree. -Roasted Corn.  A side order of corn niblets baked in a cheesy/creamy/spicy sauce.  Not too heavy, but a great accompaniment.  F-ING AWESOME: -Chipotle Glazed Rib Eye Steak.  WOW  WOW  WOW.  Best steak preparation I've had in a long time if ever.  Slightly charred and crispy on the outside and juicy and tender inside.  The glaze was not spicy at all, just light, smokey, and a tad sweet.  Sooo worth the $48 bucks.  As good as the salmon was, I stopped short of finishing it just so that I could have more Rib Eye.  Service was never under foot and timed well.  Can't wait to come back!",

    "text": "I love watching Food Network and always enjoy Bobby Flay's shows.  But the food reviews here are so mixed, I was a bit hesitating to spend my money even for lunch at Mesa Grill in Vegas.  My sister and I were too tired to find a better place, we decided to try our first Bobby Flay food.  We were there for Sunday Brunch around noon after Christmas and we're seated right away.  Our server was not bad but for some reason he had this weird energy and we didn't feel completely relaxed around him.    We wanted to have their fruit juice but we're told they were all out.  All three juices (orange, grapefruit and carrot/orange)!  That surprised me because as a restaurant by a very well known chef at this very popular hotel, I would expect them to have a decent inventory skill.  We're very disappointed and ordered cactus pear iced tea instead.  It wasn't bad but nothing special about it.   The warm bread basket had three different baked goodies.  The first one on top was almost like a soft chewy cookie with raisins and nuts.  I don't think it goes with any of their main dishes but as itself, it was very yummy and I wished I had that one after my lunch as a dessert.  I can't describe the second mini soft pretzel-ish thingy but I can say they were good.  And the bottom in the basket was a cornbread which was made with half yellow and half blue corn and had some corn, bell peppers and some chili pepper slices in it.  It was delicious.  Our waiter just dropped the basket off on our table but at the end of our brunch, I saw a different waiter at other table was explaining what they were to his guests.  The ladies at our next table were chatting pretty loud so I couldn't hear a thing but wished our waiter did the same for us.   I ordered their honey glazed salmon and my sister ordered the pork tenderloin sandwich.  My salmon was very thick but cooked perfectly and was very moist.  The honey glaze and the black bean sauce were delicious and my sister loved her sandwich too.  I had a bite and the pork was very tender and although we both agreed the fries which came with the sandwich were little salty side, but still tasty.  Was it cheap?  No, but whew, we didn't think we've wasted our money...  I don't think we can afford their dinner anytime soon after spending too much money in Vegas this time but we were very pleased with their brunch.",

Also enjoyed the Ancho Chili Salmon $32, but would prefer wild salmon over Atlantic.  The fish seemed a little oily and although the sauces made it pop, I wouldn't order it again.  The Fundido Goat Cheese dip $16 was hard to scoop, it had hardened in the iron dish and I question whether it was actual goat cheese or a blend.  The chips were chips.  The Mesa margaritas $14 each were very tart, but fresh tasting and generous with the Tequila. The woman at the bar was not as friendly as the floor staff, but she may just have been having a bad day.  Hopefully the tip we left her cheered her up.  It is a fabulous restaurant offering top notch entrees and drinks.  Can't wait to try other items on the menu the next time we are in Vegas.",

Big fan of the bread basket: blue corn muffins, jalapeno corn bread, blueberry coffee cake + butter.  haha perfectly spreadable butter  ahi tuna nachos - pretty good.  the sauce it came with was really sweet...mango i think.  too much honey, mr. flay?  haha jk corny foodie joke.  i got the lamb cobb salad.  generous portion of lamb, done medium rare, the way i like it.  delicious bacon, avocado and blue cheese dressing.  i with there was more greens!  pork loin sandwich - alright, spicy.  surprisingly because his stuff is usually smokier  the hash that my brother in law ordered looked amazing.  it was arranged like an eggs benedict  and the scramble that my sister in law got was delicious.  i liked the cheese that was mixed in",

I said three of us are here and the 4th is on his way. This information put her in an even more sour mood. We sat down and waited 15 minutes and decided to order. Our waiter was also concerned about our late friend. I ordered the pork chops which was excellent. The Churros were ok but not transcendent . The late diner arrived right after we put in our order and quickly chose his dinner.  Food was great but felt rushed and the whole dinner vibe was off. Yes we had one diner 15 minutes late but our reservations were 5:45pm not prime time dinner hour. Need to work on customer service.",

(I dont like couscous) -our waiter was great  things that werent so great -the wait, despite my reservation and the restaurant being half emptied by the Rod Stewart show -the wait for our main entrees  -my mom's Coffee-rubbed Filet Mignon: literally $44 for just the steak. it was cooked well but was too salty  -$8 for a thing of sauteed spinach. totally bland, could make it myself spinach. wayy too expensive. -i hate it when you have to order sides along with your food.   I don't think the overall flavor profiles and the menu were to my taste. what a disappointment, but thats not the restaurants fault.",

The taste was incredible with great mouth-feel.  I had a massive doggie bag to take back to my hotel room. And upon further study, lots of it was fat. So, really it wasn't such a great leftover. And even when I ate it in the restaurant, there was lots of fat.  One dining partner got the specialty grilled pork loin and proclaimed it fabulous.  For a side we got a group-split of two servings of the roasted corn, and that was terrific.  My cocktail was something with grapefruit juice. It was so refreshing (I totally love grapefruit.).",

I got the spicy scrambled eggs with potatoes. It was ok. My husband got the breakfast quesadilla which was also good. Nothing amazing for either of us and a bit pricey at around $17 a pop. The best thing about this place was the bread basket filled with amazing bread, muffins etc (some sweet, some savory and some spicy). I wish they offered their regular lunch menu on the weekends. I wasn't looking for brunch on a Saturday but didn't realize no lunch menu until I'd already been seated.",

When a restaurant wants a credit card number to hold a reservation, I'm thinking arrogance again.  (Or that a hostess wants to go shopping).  Then, of course, restaurants in casinos bring up another level of concern -- that their business model relies more on traveling salesmen's expense accounts rather than establishing themselves with a reputation for quality food and service.  With above suspicions in mind, I booked us for Sat brunch, as I wasn't about to use up a valuable Saturday Vegas Dinnertime with a place I suspected I was going to hate.  All suspicions were immediately put to rest.  We were quickly seated and paired up with a very helpful waiter who was genuinely enthusiastic about what was on the menu.  And then, nobly atop the beer list:  Aventinus Doppelbock.  I was in a good mood.  Then the food: a beautiful combination of sweet, spicy, hearty, and pretty, in particular,  the corn & shrimp tamale -- outstanding!    In other words, next time in Vegas, I do intend to give up  -- nay, enjoy! -- a valuable Saturday Dinnertime there.",

    "text": "We dined here last night for my boyfriend's birthday. The food was delicious! Bobby Flay created a delicious menu. The Fundido and lobster tacos were awesome appetizers. For dinner, we enjoyed the rabbit and tuna. Lastly, we loved the coconut layered cake for dessert! The food runners and table assistants were extremely friendly (more than any other staff)!   I was super disappointed by the front of the house, especially the hostesses. When we arrived the hostesses did not greet us, nor bid a farewell as we left the restaurant. I don't think I actually saw any of them smile the entire time we were at the restaurant.   I initially made our reservation on Open Table for 5 people. I called on Thursday to update our reservation to 6 people and I was connected to the main Luxor reservations desk. The Luxor employee was very friendly. She stated she was unable to update the party number on the reservation but she added a note for the hostess to update the reservation. She gave me the number to call Mesa Grill directly to make sure they got the note and the reservation was correct. I called Mesa Grill on Friday 4/9/15 in the afternoon. The hostess was extremely rude and unprofessional. She indicated that my reservation was for 5 people and acted irritated when I asked her to update it to 6 people. I explained how I had been previously connected to the Luxor's reservations line, etc. and she didn't seem to care. The hostess then rudely stated \"the table only holds 6 people so we cannot add anymore people onto the table\". How she knew what table we were sitting at more than 24 hours away is beyond me. Finally, we arrived and were seated at a table with EIGHT seats (annoying).  Another flaw of the restaurant is there is absolutely NO seating for guests to wait for their table. We arrived on time but were told we could not be seated until our entire party had arrived? Luckily, another guest was kind enough to share their booth in the bar area for our elderly grandparents to sit while we waited.",

I asked the waiter for a recommendation on the appetizer and he recommended the tiger shrimp tamale.  It was fantastic!  It's so good that I've been watching YouTube videos of bobby making it and am determined to nail this dish.  I ordered the lamb chops for main and it was the best lamb chop I've ever had.    What gives with the 4 stars if everything was awesome?  Well, my dishes were excellent, but my sister ordered the grilled chicken and my brother ordered the veal chop.  Being a food curious family, we shared our food.  The grilled chicken was just ok.  Think of a properly grilled piece of chicken with some fancy buffalo wing sauce.  The veal chop was recommended to be cooked medium so we went with that.  Well, it may have been medium on the tip of the edge, but was raw by the bone.    Looking back, the waiter did say excellent choice when I ordered the lamb chops.  I suppose this means the other items we ordered were not a good choice.",

    "text": "First things first - I like Bobby Flay.  I like his television shows.  I like his personality.  And I like his style of cooking.  So I ought to like Mesa Grill.  And in some ways, I do.  But there are also some issues.  The ambiance is bright and colorful, with high ceilings, lots of windows, and an impressive bar.  But the tables were packed in pretty tight.  Hey, I understand why.  The place was full on a Tuesday night!  If you can cram that many people into a space, and they still want to come, then it's just smart business.  But it isn't my taste.  My wife and I decided to try as many dishes as we could, so we shared a menu made up of appetizers and side dishes.  Our server was friendly and helpful, but he did not bring out the dishes in the order we requested.  Some dishes were what you might call \"just fine\":  The chopped salad, the blue corn pancake, and the double-baked potato.  The goat cheese queso fundido was better than \"just fine.\"  The chile relleno and the tiger shrimp were both spectacularly good - snapping with unique flavors.  The smoked chicken quesadilla, on the other hand, was sub-par and not very flavorful.  So, Mesa is a perfectly acceptable restaurant.  But when we go to a high end, pricey restaurant we really want nothing less than five stars, and Mesa doesn't quite get there.  Lots of Vegas restaurants do get there.  So we won't be back at Mesa for a while.  Sorry, Bobby.  We'll catch you at Bar Americain next time we're in New York.",

We were promptly seated, then greeted by a young man who brought us breads. Three kinds to be exact, a jalapeno, a raisin loaf and roasted corn muffins. They were all okay, non blew me away. The jalapeno bread was still a bit warm which was nice. The cocktail menu had 5 signature Chef Flay inventions that all looked like liquid dreams. Seriously yummy concoctions with obvious though and effort. There was an ample wine selection, like 22 pages of vino separated into categories by grape, not region. With that many wines, I often prefer it this way. Mesa Grill is a True Tex Mex establishment, and being such they had an entire menu for tequila and margaritas... 22 tequilas broken down into 5 separate categories!! Wow, can you say fun with a lime in your mouth?!    I ordered the pork sandwich and it came with a side of fries. The pork was well seasoned and juicy, the baguette crispy and soft and of course there was a ton of sauce that was infused with the smokey heat of Ancho Chili peppers that Flay has built an empire on! Oh and the herb spiced fries were quite tasty as well. So why only 3 stars? Honestly, it was A-OK, the food excellent and tasty, the service phenomenal, but there just wasn't any atmosphere... That feeling you get when you know you are somewhere special.... Would I return, yes! Should you, definitely! But, maybe for dinner.",

As a local, this is a must try restaurant. However with my non Love for spicy foods, I don't think I would return. It was good, the atmosphere was nice, and it was a great restaurant to try!",

The wait was too long so I ventured over to Mesa Grill after having seen it the week before in Vegas. It's a Bobby Flay restaurant so I knew it would be good.  I was seated immediately and told the waiters that I had a flight in a few hours and so they did a great job of getting me taken care of. The 2 waiters that I had were extremely friendly and quick to check on me.  They suggested that I try a pear cactus margarita. It was by far the best margarita I've ever had! The flavor was amazing and wasn't too sweet or too strong.  While I was waiting for my food, they brought me several different kinds of bread. My favorite was the jalapeno cornbread. It wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be either.  For my entree, I got the Mesa Burger. The angus beef was really juicy and the sauteed onions with the cheese and Dijon mustard made for one tasty burger. Fries had a nice seasoning to them as well. I would definitely recommend a trip to Mesa! Bobby Flay's people treated me right.",

We were deciding between Giada/BLT/Mesa Grill's and boy was I glad that I picked Mesa Grill!  11 years later Mesa Grill's deserves a BIG SOLID 5 star review (was 4.5 in my last review)  SERVICE- the whole staffs were awesome!  greeted by friendly host/hostess upon entering and got seated in 5 minutes.  Our server Christopher was very attentive and accommodated our requests accordingly.  Our busser was so attentive that our tea and water was constantly being refilled.    FOOD- I cant believe I forgot how tasty food is here.  Bread basket had 3 kinds of bread and of course the corn bread muffin was everyone's fav.  The ribeye with the rub and sauces, the spread with delicious housemade ricotta and awesome masa chips, the shrimp tamales is just as good as I remember!  The salad and the kids menu's cheese quesadilla was standard tho.  The menu hasn't changed much in the past 11 years and I can definitely understand why because it's all pretty darn tasty!   A round of applause for Bobby Flay!",

I ordered a glass of rose and mother had a patron margarita, Dad opted out of alcohol that eve.   For appetizers we had the tiger shrimp tamale and it was very delicious to the point I believe make it 2 and serve it as dinner.   For the Entree I ordered the sixteen spice chicken, Dad had the grilled lamb porterhouse chops and Mom had the  ancho chile-honey glazed salmon and we tasted one another's dish and we equally agreed that all dishes have their own unique flavor and were all great. Server and seating hosts were all great and our bus staff member was on top of things with water and bread.   This final comment is not going to make me change the star rating here but I found out throughout Cesar's hotel venues cleanliness and tidy was seems to be missing. When we left our table, I noticed a knife under the table that is clearly camouflaged with the flooring. It absolutely visible. Who knows how many guests have been seated on that table and that knife laying there in the side of the table's foot. May Be it's me who has an eye for these hidden things... but definitely will return to Mesa Grill if in Vegas again.",

We could only fit it in for Brunch but man... what a brunch.  The service was great, with a very charming and knowledgeable waiter. The double mimosa set off the morning perfectly. Perhaps that made everything taste just a bit better.  Bobby's southwestern flavors work perfectly in the arena of brunch. The Crispy Bacon and Hash Brown Quesadilla, which we shared as a starter, packed just enough spice and punch with a beautifully cooked fried egg on top. Then I had the Scrambled Eggs Chilaquiles, which were also delicious with a great sauce. The home fries were salty and crispy, and the mango-glazed bacon... wow.   Brunch doesn't get much better than this.",

Reservation made through open table. We were seated promptly. The server is knowledgable and answer to any of our questions. During our visit, they are promoting a 3 course dinner menu which include appetizer, main course and dessert for $50!! We decide to go for it, adding $15 more, we got the 24oz grilled (to perfection) porter house steak, tiger pawn and corn temale as appetizer and key lime pie for dessert. What a deal!! We also try New York steak, roasted corn soup and chocolate shortcake. All excellent. One of the nicest meal we had in Las Vegas!!",

She really took the time to take care of me.  Also, her knowledge of the menu items and what ingredients are included in each entree really impressed me, i was most grateful to her.

The halibut was good, but I thought the shrimp tamales were great. I also enjoyed my prickly pear margarita.   They were nice enough to split our checks for us. It came in one bill, but split individually on there. We had 6 different credit cards and wrote our name next to each section of the bill.

I have had the halibut, blue corn pancakes, burger (several times), chicken (16 spice or whatever they call it) and several specials (lambchops, steaks, etc.) and all of the appetizers. For the money and quality, it is an exceptional value.   While I have dined at peak hours and with kids, I recommend going right at open (11am).  Less crowded, more attentive service and more relaxed overall.  Bread offerings are very diverse.   Great mezcal selection (Del Maguay single village).  Worth a trip, and in this day and age, any restaurant open for 10+ years in Vegas is doing something right.",

Seriously, the Chilean Sea Bass was perfect in a bowl of tomato based broth with blue corn chips. Hubby's Mahi Mahi was devoured quicker than I could taste it and our friend had a perfectly cooked medium pork tenderloin. The service was excellent. I was a little disappointed that when I told them it was my husband's birthday I thought they would bring him a dessert. They still get 5* from me.",

    "text": "Pro-Tip: Watch what shoes you wear here! I was wearing some new boots and almost slipped three times on their slick floors!   Came here for lunch with a ton of research from other Yelp reviews. There were many reviews that mentioned how accommodating the wait staff were and to not be afraid to ask for dinner items during lunch time.  Well this wasn't the case for me... I was really interested in the Pork Tenderloin and goat cheese tamale. When I asked our waiter ,Mike ,it seemed as though I was annoying him with my questions and replied we have what is on the menu.  We ordered the Partida Margarita and Prickly Pear Margarita. The prickly pear was the better of two but both were very smooth. Each table is served a basket of bread that seems to be a big cause of debate. It is served with a jalapeno cornbread muffin, jalapeno white bread, and a raisin bread. The cornbread was my favorite! It had a ton of flavor and with the fresh butter was simply delicious. There is some debate about it being too dry...so if you are more of a cornbread casserole fan, this may not be for you.  We were lucky enough to try the tiger shrimp tamale which tasted great. The sauce was the best part of this dish.  I ordered the Pork tenderloin sandwich which was pretty good. It has a strong apple flavor but I loved the sauce on the sandwich. It is served with fries but I wish a sauce was served with, even if it is just ketchup.   My boyfriend ordered the Shrimp tacos which was recommended as the most popular item. When they brought out the tacos it seemed a bit underwhelming. It is displayed as two shrimp skewers with two tortillas, and served with a trio of sauces including mango salsa, green salsa, and guacamole so you can make your own taco.   It is interesting because as a Food Network Star watcher, Bobby Flay seems to be against a \"make your own\" concept because its possible for customers to not get the flavor combination you are going for. The shrimp had a nice flavor but needed more to fill up your belly. My boyfriend was still starving after eating his plate that we ended up splitting my pork tenderloin sandwich which was a lot of food anyway.  The interior of the restaurant was decorated nicely and you are given a nice view of the sports book located in Caesars Palace.",

While you wait for your food they bring out a basket of assorted baked goods- the corn muffin and jalapenos biscuits were delish. We ordered 'mosas and bloody marys- a bit overpriced and small in my opinion. But they're probably not using Andre or Cook's in their mimosas, if you know what i mean.   i got their corn tamale appetizer (which apparently is the most popular item on their menu)- it was good but a tad sweet, really tasted like corn meal/ bread vs using actual masa. My dining mates inhaled their food- the chilequiles and bacon quesadilla.   It's spendy and it looks fancy. But don't be intimidated. You're more than welcome here the day after a hard night.",

We could not have been more disappointed.  The kitchen was out of several items and the chicken dish was very fatty and undercooked.  We sent it back, but it could not be replaced as the kitchen closed the moment our food came out. In a fine dining restaurant, I would expect them to check and make sure the food was properly cooked and acceptable well before closing.  The men's room was also trashed...literally hand towels overflowing and all over the floor.  I went in at the beginning of dinner and mentioned this to the hostess, but it was not addressed as I went back in at the end of dinner and it was the same. We left a bit hungry and disappointed. Three bright spots: The server was very good, the shrimp tamale was amazing and the pork tenderloin was delicious.  Vegas is loaded with amazing places to eat...do yourself a favor and don't go here.",

    "text": "Known for its gorgeous, drool inducing bread basket, Mesa Grill was one of our culinary must stops in Vegas!   My husband (then boyfriend) and I actually visited the NYC location prior to its closing in 2012. I remembered loving their spiced chicken sweet potato hash. I decided to order it again and honestly it was better than I remembered! Every component was beautifully assembled and perfectly made.    I way overate the meals prior (and of course there was the famed bread basket) yet I polished my plate clean! I did however wish my entree was a little warmer.   Tiger shrimp tamale - tbh i was a bit disappointed and thought this dish was just okay. The sauce was really salty and the tamale reminded me of the remnant of their corn muffins. Definitely not worth the $19. I probably would be happier if I had ordered a second spiced chicken hash.   A side of grits - their grits deserve a paragraph of its own. Not sure what they add into it but the texture + the spice + the flavor were so spot on. I didn't think I had the stomach for it but it happily managed.   Service - major kudos to our two servers who handled our awkward seating situation so professionally. Side story - the table near us had two young kids who threw up/soiled themselves some time during their meal. Not sure how, what, and when but the servers were able to accommodate us with a new table further away without embarrassing either parties. New plates, utensils, drinks, even bread basket were all brought over to the new table. Couldn't have asked for better service.   Overall - definitely stop in for their famed brunch service! Won't be disappointed!",

After we were seated for our 7:45 p.m. reservation on Saturday night we were greeted by our waiter, Kent. He was very polite and attentive at first. My girlfriend informed him we were celebrating both of our birthdays (mine next week and her 21st the previous.) Naturally, he asked for our IDs and that's when things turned sour.  It almost seems like after he learned of our ages (22 and 21) he became disinterested in us. When we asked for recommendations he said \"everything is good here,\" and walked off. He avoided eye contact throughout the evening, never asked us how the food was and never offered us anything for our birthdays when the gentleman sitting next to us got a cake with a candle.  But perhaps what upset us the most is when we paid the check, all he did was nonchalantly toss the bill on our table. No \"thanks for coming in\" or \"hope to see you next time.\"  Nothing. Just sat it down and walked off.  Kent, just because my girlfriend and I are young and in Vegas does not mean we cannot afford dinner or to tip you. Even with your shoddy, poor service you still received 17.5% of the tab because we don't believe in stiffing waiters/waitresses. Had you treated us like every other guest at the restaurant, you would have easily received the full 20%. Don't judge a book by its cover and don't ruin a special night for two people just because they're slightly younger than the majority of people who dine in that restaurant.",

I understand that people have a job to do, but the feeling of being rushed and anxious reflects on the guests. Maybe my hopes were too high. The best summer seasonal thing on the menu is the corn. Get it and you won't be let down",

I went in with extremely higher expectations and ordered items that I haven't eaten in years (and had reserved myself to not liking). The lamb chops were on a whole new level of delicious and words cannot describe the seared ahi tuna steak. Our server Brenda really made the experiance though. Her knowledge and recommendations helped us make great food decisions and she was one of the kindest people I've met. Marco was also helping and he was fantastic as well. Thank you to the entire staff at Mesa for making tonight amazing!",

I ordered the lamb chops with a side of Brussels sprouts. I had asked for the chops to be cooked medium rare but it was served almost raw and inedible. They were so tough and chewy that I literally couldn't eat them.  The server had mentioned they tend to undercook a bit. A friend ordered a steak med rare and it was served medium. These guys shouldn't be getting the meats wrong for the price you pay here. The sprouts were pretty good but a little over cooked. Overall, very disappointing. Won't ever come back.",

I do have my favorites in that world but for mostly different reasins than their cuisine. So we had tickets to Absinthe and decided to eat at Ceasar's Palace before the show. The menu at Mesa Grill intrigued me so we gave it a go. We started with the tiger shrimp tamale. The flavor was good and the shrimp delicious but the crumbled tamale left me a bit confused.  For dinner I enjoyed the veal chop. Honestly this is the first time I had a veal chop but it wont be the last. I am a fan!!! The chop was expertly prepared, cooked, and presented. More importantly with the accompanying sauce it was also absolutely delicious.  For dessert we shared an apple cheesecake. To me it seemed more carmel apple than cheeecake but it was very tasty.  I have gained an appreciation of what Bobby Flay has done here. Southwestern and Mexican dishes transformwd into a rare experience. His experience, it was a pleasure.",

We had the queso fundido to start, and it was SO good - best I've ever had. The diverse and complimentary flavors were the biggest theme throughout - everything perfectly worked and was so interesting. We also had the pork tenderloins and the chile relleno. Both were incredible, and the relleno was my favorite. It's very mushroom-forward, which I loved, but my husband didn't like as much. Finally, we ended with the pecan bourbon tart, which went well with the refreshing sour cream ice cream. The service was also very good, and the decor is cool. They were also able to seat us early, which was nice. Definitely one of the best southwestern meals I've had, and Bobby Flay's food lives up to the hype!",

We had a reservation and were seated very promptly and greeted by our super amazing and friendly waiter! I forgot his name, but he has been at Mesa Grill since its opening and has so much knowledge regarding the menu and drinks.   We ordered margaritas, I highly recommend the White Peach Margarita, and Don Julio on the rocks. They have so many tequilas so there is definitely something for everyone. The bread basket that came with the drinks was so good! I loved how our waiter explained the breads to me: asiago cheese, grain with walnuts, and of course their famous corn muffin (my favorite)  For the appetizer we ordered their famous Tiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale, it was absolutely delicious and the flavors infused in that little tamale was awesome!   Entrees we ordered the 22oz Bone In Chipotle Glazed Rib-Eye and the Fire Roasted Veal Chop. The Veal came with a sweet potato tamale, and we ordered the mashed potatoes + green chile queso sauce to accompany the rib-eye. The Veal and Rib-Eye were cooked to perfection and the sides were awesome as well. I really loved the spicy kick to both the sauces.   My favorite out of the two was probably the rib-eye since the horseradish flavor in the veal was a little too strong for my taste, but delicious nevertheless.   The service was on point as well as the cuisine, and compared to other Vegas high end restaurants the pricing was very fair and I will definitely be back again!",

You just work at a high profile name restaurant you're not the owner. Food was mediocre. Drinks were good and so was the bread. We also had an unexpected visitor a fly that happened to land on our bread in the bread basket. This concerns me,being that this restaurant is located far into the casino not outside ,so Im wondering where those things are nesting. We didn't eat much of our dinner the chicken was rubbery and inedible. The salmon was ok. Needless to say I'm never eating here again. The ambiance is boring. All hype and no bite!!!",

I went for dinner with my husband and mother in law and we each got something different for the sake of trying a bit of everything. I had the pork tenderloin which was good but not phenomenal. The pork was good but other than being spicy, it didn't have a ton of flavor. My plate was accompanied by a sweet potato tamale which was quite the disappointment. The tamale was grainy and falling apart and not sweet enough. My husband had the chicken which he thought was amazing, and it was topped with mango chunks which is pretty yummy stuff. My mother in law had the salmon which she found lack luster and also found a bone in it (weird). I'm from Chicago and have had the pleasure at eating at some of Rick Bayless restaurants, and I hate to compare,  but let's just say this was definitely no where near what I was hoping for. The prices are obviously high because it's Vegas and what can we expect, but the quality wasn't there. Overall our meal wasn't bad by any means but it just wasn't great either. I wouldn't go back, and would probably say you can skip this one.",

My husband had the house margarita and I had the peach margarita and they were really good. For an appetizer, we got the goat cheese queso fundido with blue chips, DELICIOUS!!! I ordered the New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin with bourbon-ancho chile sauce. Sweet potato tamale with crushed pecan butter and my husband had \"the most expensive steak on the menu\" aka black angus new york strip steak and both were phenomenal!   Our sides were mashed potatoes, roasted corn with creme fraiche and green onions (waiter's recommendation)  When making reservations, we wanted to see if it was ok to bring our daughter who was 9 months, they were very catering to it. Make reservations early, sometimes you won't get a reservation until 10pm!   The meal came to about $190 for 2 people, but completely worth it. Mr. Flay, you are a genius, that is all.",

A good tex mex place is always guaranteed to please, so we decided to try this out -- plus it is Bobby Flay's restaurant, right? (yeah, like chefs matter in Las Vegas anymore...every place is owned by a famous person).  I started out with a cactus margarita, which is sweet, but also strong. Then came the queso fundido -- decent, but somehow didn't really hit the spot because of the lack of spices. Too mellow, I guess. However, the bread basket was another story -- everything was so good, I just stuffed myself with it. My favourite has to be the cornbread followed by the jalapeno scone.   I had the tiger shrimp with corn tamale, after hearing so much about it from various sources. It didn't disappoint! The sauce and the shrimp were tasty, and the corn tamale was bursting with loads of flavours. It's a must-try.  The wait service was...ok. Our waitress was nice but seemed a bit overwhelmed, and the bus service was just horrible. Bread came after we finished our appetizer. Things were served out of order and hectic, and cleared out of the way slowly.  In short, bring a big stomach to this place. The plates I got were \"appetizer-sized\" but they were enough to stuff me, especially after I devoured a couple pieces of pastries from the bread basket. Plus, you might want to get a couple different things to try since everything looks so good.  Oh, and just ignore the busboys.",

Everytime I go to our tradeshow at Caesar's, I make sure to eat at Mesa a minimum of 2-3 times. Lunch or dinner, you won't be dissapointed.   Here are my favorite dishes: -apple salad: an awesome salad as far as salads go -lobster tacos: TO DIE FOR, I could eat 10 of these in 5 minutes - Blue corn pancake with duck: a must try!  -coffee rub filet mignon: can't go wrong with a filet, always done to perfection -new york strip: my personal favorite of the steaks, delicious and a huge portion -rib-eye: flavorful and very filling, big enough to share at lunch  -pork tenderloin: well done and great if you don't want steak  We usually share the mashed potatoes and spinach sides which are also good. The service is always excellent and the jalapeno corn bread they give you is awesome. I would give Mesa 5 stars, but the price (naturally) knocks it down a peg for me. The cocktails are good enough, while not being as great as the price is high.   My best friend loves Mesa so much that even when staying at the Mirage, he pulls himself away from the poker table long enough to trek over just to dine here multiple times a day. Now that's commitment. Give Mesa a try for sure!",

    "text": "Without any reservations, yelp, or two open seats at the bar perhaps my taste buds wouldn't have had the pleasure of knowing what the wonderful food this place has to offer tastes like.   Once my friend and I arrived we were let known that without reservations unless we took the seats open at the bar we would not be able to eat until 9:30pm (we arrived at 6pm) so we decided to take the seats at the bar. Nick nicely introduced himself and the margaritas available.  We started with the lobster shrimp tacos as an appetizer (comes with 3) which proceed with caution, they are small...however they are full of flavor and completely worth trying! For entree, I had the sixteen spice chicken that had a DELICIOUS garlic mango sauce with cilantro pesto mashed potatoes on the side. For dessert my friend and I shared the banana Creme deep dish which was great for sharing. Overall visiting here was a great experience. Come with an adventurous spirit and a wallet ready to spend",

I also had the salmon quesadilla - so so at best. Most important is that the air conditioning was blowing the entire time. We were not only very cool, but the food gets cold fast, and that is not good. I realize the staff is warm, but you need to think about the customers as well",

    "text": "I love you Bobby Flay!  Never had brunch this sexy and sophisticated! What a great place to dine when you don't want to wait for hours to get inside the Bacchanal Buffet or if you're simply looking for a great restaurant in Vegas.  Love the American Southwest inspired interior. It's bright and colorful, but not obnoxious and has a non intimidating fine dining feel. Food was amazing and very memorable. We came on a Saturday brunch, and they serve traditional American brunch fare with a south-western twist.   We HAD -Complimentary pastries -blue corn bread, mini jalapeno biscuits, coffee cake with butter on the side. Everything was yummy! -TIGER SHRIMP TAMALE $18- Everyone's fav so I had to get it. 4 pieces of tiger shrimp on a bed of housemade tamale with roasted garlic cream sauce on top. It was was mix of a bit sweet from the tamale and savory from the shrimp and garlic sauce. Amazing. GET IT!  -BLUE CORN WAFFLE $14 - Crispy on the outside, light and soft on the inside. The bluecorn gave it a nutty flavor to the waffle. It's different and I liked it. It also had had enough black berry syrup that's not too sweet and the creme fraiche on top to cuts the sweetness. So good! -MANGO GLAZED BACON $4.50- Recommended by our server. 2 thick strip of their house cured bacon with mango glaze on top. Wow! never thought of mango with bacon and it's delicious!  -MESA BURGER $18- Perfectly cooked beef patty, double cheddar and grille onion. So simple yet delicious. It came with southwestern fries (french fries with chili powder) and horseradish mustard dip. GET IT!  Service was great. Our server was very nice and attentive. The table next to us was actually very rude to our server, but he remained professional and killed them with kindness. I also asked if Bobby ever comes to visit and he said about 3x a year since he is a very busy man.",

    "text": "Lunch here was unexpectedly good!  I had never ate at a Bobby Flay establishment before and was not really in a hurry to try.  Truth be told I've never really been a fan of his but, after reading several reviews of some trusty yelp friends I decided to give this place a try.  The resto is located in Caesar's palace.  The decor is warm but clean and open.  We came here during lunch with no reservation.  Waited about 15min and was seated near the kitchen.  Im realizing more and more that there are tables for 2 which I get but seriously can the tables be a little bigger!!!  I'm just saying!!  So after looking over the menu I remembered that everyone was raving about the tamales so we ordered that, and another appetizer to share and our main.  Tiger shrimp roasted corn tamale ~ First let me say the masa was very light unlike other tamales I've had.  The shrimp was plump and cooked perfectly.  The cilantro sauce was creamy but also very light and really brought the entire dish together.  Blue corn pancake ~ Barbecued Duck with Habanero Chile and Star Anise Sauce.  Holy moly I would have to say this was the star of the dining experience.  I never would have thought to sauce up duck with BBQ.  This was a fantastic dish.    Smoked Shrimp Tacos ~ Skewered shrimp with Cabbage Slaw and Grilled Tortillas.  It came with 3 salsas to use.  The shrimp had a decent smoke flavor to it.  There was not heat to it although it looked like there could be.  To me it was just your typical shrimp taco.  Nothing too exciting.  The mango salsa with a bit of kick was really tasty.  Grouper ~ I only had a bit of it.  The portion was really bit and had great flavor.  It didn't appear to be dry which I don't care for when eating fish.  We passed on dessert since lunch already started off late plus we had other plans.  All in all I would have to say it was a pleasant experience.  I would not mind coming back here to eat.    Eyes ~ Warm and inviting decor. Nose ~ Even though we say near the kitchen there was not a smell that was present! Ear ~ Not very loud.  Just your usual! Mouth ~ Duck in BBQ sauce! Tummy ~ Very well satisfied!",

The waitress brought out a breadbasket, which had a variety of bread. We also got two free appetizers, because they sent it to the wrong table. Luck was on our side.  I went with the signature dish for my entree- New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin. I never had pork that tasted so good! It was melt in your mouth tender. I also loved the little bit of kick it had to it and the sauces. The dish also came with sweet potato tamale with crushed pecan butter. Both spicy and sweet represented on the plate. I liked the tamale but it wasn't on the same level as the pork.   I left with a full stomach and a great impression of Bobby Flay. In the future, I'll seek out his other restaurants.",

The chicken was so amazingly delicious, after I shared a bit with everyone, they kept asking for more, and then more.   I only got maybe a third to myself.   Everyone agreed that it was the best dish.  Three of the 4 dishes we ordered were naturally gluten free, so my celiac daughter got to eat her veal dish, plus my chicken, and the salmon.     The veal was huge, juicy, and very tender.   The salmon was buttery.  The rabbit was good, but not as good as my chicken dish.   We were all very happy with our meal.     Just about everyone table there order their shrimp and corn tamale, it is also gluten free, and we agree, this is a must eat dish.",

When entertaining clients we chose the Mesa Grill, once again, due to their outstanding foods, service and ambiance.   This trip I decided to changed it up and try the rare ahi steak, lightly grilled. This dish is excellent and lighter fare than I generally go for. This meant more room for dessert and having perfectly paced this evening, tonight was the night for Churros! Not just any churro, but Bobby's special churros dusted with cinnamon sugar and star anise,  dark chocolate and  coconut dulce de leche dipping sauces.   Wow! So, much for the healthy Ahi!  We had another excellent meal with incredible service. I love their wine list as well.   Incredible culinary experience.",

    "text": "Was looking forward to eating at Mesa Grill, have yet to try Bobby Flay's dishes. Unfortunately (or fortunately) I've been eating a lot of food in Vegas, so I was decidedly un-hungry when I arrived for lunch.   I figured a margarita would help open the palate. For the premium margaritas you choose the tequila and they add lime juice and triple sec. I chose Gran Centenario Anejo, and the result was amazing. Lots of tangy lime juice, keeping it refreshing and not at all syrupy.   I ordered the Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad, and it was amazing. The presentation was so beautiful I was compelled to try it, even though my stomach was threatening me with possible mutiny.   One bite and I was hooked. The chicken was cooked perfectly, very tender and the seasoning packed a punch without going overboard. Swirled in the green onion vinaigrette, it was the perfect blend of charred grill flavor, mild sweetness and tangy boldness. I devoured the whole thing.",

I'm thinking - Cheesecake Factory mass organization with no intimacy, EVERYTHING you say (or your neighbor says) is like you're at the same table with everyone one else.  2.  Service - no complaints.  3.  Appetizer - SMOKED CHICKEN + BLACK BEAN QUESADILLA * Avocado + Toasted Garlic Creme Fraiche $15. - Fantastic!  Wow.  4.  NEW MEXICAN SPICE RUBBED PORK TENDERLOIN * Bourbon - Ancho Chile Sauce Sweet Potato Tamale - + Crushed Pecan Butter $36.  My meal.  Meat - no flavor.  Tender, but nothing special.  The sauces were ok.  The Tamale was DRY - disappointing.  Not anywhere near worth $36.. but the plate looked good.  5.  GRILLED LAMB PORTERHOUSE CHOPS * -Blackberry - Cascabel Barbecue Sauce + Collard Greens with Smoked Chiles $44.  My dining companions meal.  Blah.  Had a taste and was glad I ordered my boring pork tenderloin.  Collard Greens were nothing special.  6.  There was a side corn dish.  $10 fantastic.  I wish we had ordered two quesadillas and two orders of corn and called it good.  It was a Monday night - I was surprised it was so slow there that we walked right in and sat down.  Maybe I know why now.  With a $7 and a $14 bottle of beer... the $140 pre-tip was NOT money well spent.   At those prices... Bobby doesn't get a second chance... I had a steak at a mexican place in the MGM a couple of years ago that blew my socks off... I think I'll go back there tonight.",

Service: friendly, happy, a little too much, over-the-top, bordering on annoying.  Food: MOST IMPORTANT !!!  White Tiger Shrimp Tamale appetizer: original,  well-executed, quality ingredients, however surprisingly salty - weird as I like salt.  Squash Blossoms with Mango Chile Sauce: good texture, crispy, visually appealing, however the blossom itself was a little bland and the sauce a little cloyingly sweet.  Pork Tenderloin in Ancho Chile Bourbon Sauce: with two complimentary sauces and a sweet corn tamale on the side: LIKE BUTTER !!! The tenderloin was buttery, moist and decadent. Again the sauce was a little too sweet but offset by the red pepper sauce droplets and the cilantro oil. The tamale was tiny and delicious.  Dessert: Banana Creme Pie on steroids - gorgeous banana creme mousse piped between two hazelnut toffee thin cookies, which covered beautifully thinly sliced bananas. Gorgeous, artistic and tasty.  Also! wonderful margaritas - excellent balance of sweet, salty, acidic and beauty in presentation.  Would I try this again? Hard call as there are so, so many choices in Viva Las Vegas.",

The first time we came for lunch:  I read the description of Sophie's chopped salad and wanted it, eyed a pretty salad that ended up being it, ordered it and enjoyed every bite.  Bf had the Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad that was also delicious. Our company who came late ended up getting the same thing since it was so good.   We also came for weekend dinner.  As far as appetizers, the Lobster Tacos were filled with soft, delicious chopped lobster complimented by the crisp of the shell. The Blue Corn Pancakes with duck are very similar to a Chinese duck wrap dish, with a very rich flavor. For the main entree you can't go wrong with the lamb, pork chops, or the salmon... all were perfectly cooked and delicious. The tamales that come with the lamb and pork are a bit atypical, with a more ground up consistency than your normal formed tamale- the Sweet Pototo and the Plantain flavors were unique.   Bread basket was really unique: jalapeno corn bread (amaaazzing), walnut bread, asiago bun (drool).  Friendly service, definitely on the slower side for weekend dinner (from ordering to food arrival was ~45 minutes.",

First, there are at least 20 people working in the front of the restaurant, and not once did any of them smile ever. I watched the entire staff and they seemed distant at best. OK so first the food. Ordered nine dishes and only was was any good. Blue corn tamale, Chile releno, and cauliflower gratin all underflavored. The sweet potato casserole was marginal. The romaine salad was described to have chorizo sausage. Only one dime sized slice appeared on the plate. The lobster tacos were fantastic, although a very small portion for almost 20 bucks. We arrived 20 minutes early for our reservation and the manager was reluctant to seat us even though the place was half empty. He originally said we'd have to wait until closer to the reservation time. I came here 2 years ago and had a great dinner. (See prior review.) Not sure what happened but it looks like the place is more touristy. Sad to have had this experience.",

The traditional margs were fantastic, although I wish there was a wider selection of original-recipe margaritas.  To share we had the goat cheese queso which was delicious if you're into cheesy items The bread basket was pretty nice with the blue-cornbread   I got the pork tenderloan which was fantstic and very filling with all of its sides (the sweet potato tamle was awesome). I also tried the rabbit and lobster tacos, which were both nice too.   Really nice service and a fun environment in the heart of Ceasar's Palace. Would definitely come back at some point in the future",

We were greeted by our waitress who was more than willing to offer suggestions that were quite reliable based upon the smiles on our faces by the end of the meal.  When we asked about wine, she made some recommendations, but also she had their wine guy, Bernardo come over and greet us.  He was fantastic.  He spoke well and made great recommendations for a group of six with very distinct tastes.  Our meals were served in a timely fashion.  We were surprised that the items that were made medium rare were barely warm, but we figured that was part of the way food was served here.  The flavors in each of our dishes were amazing.  Nobody left disappointed.",

The Goat Cheese Fundido was the best out of all the app choices, but all still good.  Entree:  SPICY SCRAMBLED EGGS, RANCH STYLE EGGS TOSTADA, BLUE CORN BUTTERMILK WAFFLE, MESA BURGER (2). My favorite was the Spicy Eggs, holy smokes, I can taste them now. Everyone loved their entrees and demolished the food.  Be sure to make a reservation for any meal you plan on eating here.

He was extremely attentive and suggested Margaritas which we both found to be on the tart side.  We had him sweeten them with Agave.  For a Tuesday night the place was packed for dinner despite the poor reviews.  I ordered the Pork tenderlon which was a little dry.  It came with a sauce that was tasty.  My girlfriend ordered the Ribeye which was HUGE.  I was extremely impressed by how much of dent she made in it.  It seemed to be cooked to order.  As per Joel's suggestion we ordered the corn as a side dish.  It was super tasty.  The highlight of the meal for me.  All in all it was one of the better meals that we had in Vegas but I would search a few other places for the overall experience.",

My only regret is not ordering the Tiger Shrimp Tamale, I still think about it to this day.  I was talking with the bartender, I asked him if Bobby Flay comes out to check up on the place, and he said yes he does, about once every few months, he comes out with his crew, hangs out in the kitchen, just makes sure everything is going well.  I was like wow, he is still hands on with his business. Overall a good time, food quality is high, service was good, would love to go back and try some different items on the menu.",

We came for weekend brunch and found the service, food quality and ambiance to be great. The appetizer of Tuna Nachos consisted of really good quality fish and was robust in flavor. The bread basket ( complimentary) was amazing from scones to cornbread. Have never been to a restaurant with such an amazing bread basket. Add to that the final courses of Ancho Salmon & Scrambled eggs with biscuits and the restaurant hit a home run. Margaritas were also tasty and unique ( pear cactus marg?! Wow!)....lastly service was great with staff who followed up consistently and were friendly. Highly recommend for anyone coming to Vegas!",

The tamale was silky and creamy.  The flavor was magnificent.    Next the duck was cooked perfectly.  It was tender and the star anise sauce complimented the duck well.  The habenero sauce added extra heat.  The New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin was really great.  The pork was cooked to a perfect pink medium and also was juicy.  The ancho chile sauce worked well with the pork.  The Chile Relleno was really good.  The crusty exterior was cooked perfectly.  But the inside was moist and has tons of flavor.  Finally the Chipotle Glazed Rib-eye was a little underwhelming.  While it was cooked perfectly, the chipotle glaze didn't enhance the meat.  If anything, I think it disguised or masked the nice beef flavor.  I think it would have been better just with salt and pepper.  Anyway, very solid restaurant.",

Being an avid watcher of Food Network, I've longed to try this place because of Bobby Flay. As soon as we went in the restaurant, I was told to take off my hat, which was fine but weird considering that was the only dresscode. That being said, they were serving their brunch menu. Our server was very kind and attentive and asked if we had any questions. I decided to eat light and order the Corn Tamale with Garlic Grilled Shrimp while my father ordered the Mesa burger. In the meanwhile, we were served a bread basket consisting of jalapeno biscuits, some sort of banana fruit crumble, and savory cornbread. You could really see a lot of southwest influence here. The food came out, and for the shrimp tamale, the shrimp was very flavorful and the sauce and corn tamale balanced perfectly with it. I also had half of my father's burger which I have to say the medium rare patty and the simplicity of the burger itself made it one of the best burgers I have ever had. The fries were just cajun spiced fries. For the desert, I settled for a carrot cake ice cream sandwich with roasted pineapple. The ice cream was cream cheese flavor, and you could really taste the cream cheese presence along with vanilla flavoring. Only complaint with this desert is that the carrot cookie is a bit too hard to bite into. The roasted pineapples were also a great compliment! All in all, for lunch, Bobby Flay is a good man. Vegas food is usually a hefty price to pay, but the prices are fair and the food is worthwhile, so definitely give it a try!",

While the food we ordered was very flavorful and fresh tasting the portion sizes and prices were a little disappointing. We started off with the lobster taco appetizer which was recommended by our waitress. It came with three tiny bite size \"tacos.\" They had good flavor but definitely not worth $20 for about two bites. Next we ordered the spice rubbed pork loin to share. The food presentation was great, and it tasted delicious, but once again we assumed we could share. We left hungry.   Maybe we are not high class enough for this place? I don't know. But in my opinion I think it might be another celebrity chef restaurant hype. Most likely will not visit again.",

Six thimble sized biscuits, a cheddar jalapeno corn muffin, two pieces of blueberry coffee cake and two miniature chocolate scones.  It looks pretty, and is a fun gesture, but the only bread of note was the blueberry coffee cake.  The scones and biscuits were both very dry.  We split the shrimp tamale appetizer, smoked chicken sweet potato hash and the cheese grits.  The tamale was just as good as it looks in photos, and if I came again I would definitely order one (or two) of those.  The sauce was very salty, so if you are sensitive to that you might want to pick a different item.  The hash had a really strong vinegar flavor.  I like vinegar, but the whole thing just tasted like someone had dumped a bunch of cheap hot sauce all over it.  Plus, it came out really fast, and was lukewarm.  With all the great reviews of this dish, I was very unimpressed - especially with the $18 price tag. The cheese grits were not at all what I was expecting.  Good Southern style grits are fluffy, these are very heavy.  They tasted like cream cheese and green chili, so it is hard to say they were bad, they just weren't at all as expected.  The service was attentive - too attentive!  One of the servers was literally standing over my husbands shoulder waiting for him to take his last bite.  This just felt awkward.    Perhaps dinner would be a better time to go, but I just feel like this place is more about aesthetics and less about freshness and flavor.",

To start off the meal, we had a little bit of each of the breads in the breadbasket, which was a nice touch. I think my favorite was the muffin.  We also had an order of the lobster tacos, which were alright, but probably my least favorite dish of the night.  For my entree, I decided to go with the swordfish and I was not disappointed. Probably one of the most enjoyable preparations of swordfish I have ever had. The fish was cooked perfectly and paired nicely with the rest of the dish.  For dessert, we went with the churros, which was a fun way to finish the meal. The sauces were decent, but I preferred the dulce de leche over the chocolate.  In addition, I had a couple prickly pear margaritas that were very tasty and had a nice kick to them.  Overall, this place holds to the Vegas prices, but backs it up with quality food and service.",

For the main I got the spiced pork tenderloin sandwich. Definitely a must try. You have to come to his place with the expectation that everything will have his signature kick to it.   I came on a Tuesday day time and there was still a small wait for lunch. I recommend calling in a reservation if you're dinning in for dinner.",

    "text": "Holy moly, you guys.  Talk about AMAZING FOOD!  Gah, I am still salivating over this meal and it's been 4 days!  We love us some Bobby Flay, so naturally we would choose to spend one of our two nights at Mesa Grill.  It was our first time, and we were very excited.  Mesa did not disappoint!  We had 7 pm reservations but headed to Caesars early to get drinks somewhere.  We ended up at Mesa early, and they were able to seat us right away. Perfect, cuz we were hungry!  We had a table in the back that was tiny and super close to our neighbors, but after the overall food experience, that didn't matter.  We started with cocktails which were tasty.  I tried the grapefruit vodka drink and my hubby had the one with Hendricks and cucumbers.  I am a vodka lover, but we both agreed his was amazing and tastier than mine.  We ordered 2 starters - the tiger prawn tamale and the smoked chicken quesadilla.  The tamale was out of this world!  I could eat that sauce on basically anything...so good!  The shrimp were delicious and the tamale was sweet with big corn kernels throughout.  If you go, you MUST get this.  A bread basket came with an amazing corn muffin (but only one...which was sad, haha), some jalapeno cheese bread and a raisin walnut bread.  Not sure why the 3rd one was there, but my hubby liked it.    We ordered a second round of drinks, and this is where one star comes off.   The waiter touted a certain margarita, but my hubby wanted the create-your-own style with his favorite tequila.  The waiter then said, \"sir, if I may, you really need to get this one.  It's so smooth...\" and bla bla bla, so he did, but asked for it on the rocks instead of up.  It came, up.  So we asked again for it on the rocks, and it came, but was only ok.  My hubby wished the server would have just let him order what he wanted.     For our entree, we shared the seared scallops and they were heavenly.  They were so crisp on the outside, well seasoned and perfectly done.  The grits it came with were amazing too.  Definitely recommend!  Dessert was the toasted coconut cake and I honestly don't know if I've ever had cake that good in my life!  So moist, and so coconutty!  What I wouldn't give for another slice...  The ambiance is a little casual for the price point, but still nice.  Our server was attentive but the pushiness about that marg was off-putting.  Sometimes you just have to let the customer order what they want.  All in all, this was the best food we had in Vegas and we will be back!",

We started with goat cheese queso fundido... That was soo good, the best part is if you get a piece of cheese that was golden by the broiler that all is to die for. The ribeye is grilled to get perfection and super tender and juicy. I had the pork tenderloin with the sweet tamale and yes it is does have a kick but you can cool off your mouth with one of their delicious cactus pear margaritas!! We ended the night with an order of churros, they were alright but I am from a city where you can get the best churros ever.",

So we came back in an hour and they walked us to a small table that was placed by its self (looked like it was just pulled from a closet) in the traffic flow from kitchen.  Heat waves flowing off of the grills were HOT. Place settings took up entire table space, menus placed on top slid off.  I started to look at wine list with menu in my lap and looked at my wife and asked if she was happy with this table.  HELL NO, was her response so we went to the hostess and explained that the table was unacceptable and left.  The staff were professional and courteous but keep that table in the closet!",

First off....the corn muffins in the bread basket! I could have made a meal of those. Can I please have the recipe!!!! We had the shrimp appetizer and it was simply delicious. The presentation w the corn husk was lovely. For mains we had tuna and halibut. The tuna is a winner!!! The halibut was huge and yummy although it's served in a bowl w broth and really should come w a spoon. We were too full for dessert but boy did we want it. Shout out to sheldon for being super friendly.  One big concern for me is the decor and ambience. I was seated facing windows and a clear view of the sports book area. Like, why?!?! This is a bobby restaurant. I'm there for mood and experience and that was not what I came for. Otherwise it was all amazing and I would go back. Oh and I was soooo disappointed to learn he was at Caesars and sadly we did not meet him.",

I have to admit, I had some expectations since the restaurant is owned by Bobby Flay especially since he's always talking about flavors and southwestern cuisine. But it was just so..whatevers.  We ordered the shrimp tamale, queso fundito dip, and the Chile rellano. The shrimp tamale was just alright..nothing special. The queso fundito dip wasnt bad but it certainly wasnt worth $18 bucks. My husband ordered the chile rellano and the crust was so dry and dense. Overall the food was just heavy and bleh.  The service was average. The server left us with the dessert menu and didnt come back for 15 mins so by that time I changed my mind and all I wanted to do was leave.  Dont believe the hype..",

We got the:   Appetizer:  Tiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale- The Tamales had the most delicious sauces infused into it.   Entrees:  1. Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops (medium)- Perfectly cooked and very well seasoned with very bold flavors. It was spicy and I loved it!.  2. Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin Bourbon (medium)- ancho chile sauce sweet potato tamale with crushed pecan butter. It was tangy and the sauces perfectly complemented the meat.   Dessert:  We got the chocolate cake? (don't remember what it was called): It was layered date & chocolate cake with a salted chocolate sauce, a crunchy rice crispy garnish and a scoop of Vanilla ice cream - VERY VERY Good.  Pros:  The price compared to the other high end restaurants in Vegas.   The Food! was perfect. The ambiance is great for small parties.   Cons:  I went there with my wife for dinner and we were lucky the seats next to us emptied out not too long after we got there or else it would have been cramped and included in the conversations around us.",

We had several waiters come by to check on us periodically and refill our waters and drinks. We ordered the lobster tacos and tiger shrimp corn tamale in cilantro sauce. We only had appetizers because it was late and we weren't starving, just wanted a little something. The tacos were tiny little bite-sized hard shelled tacos with bold flavors in every bite.  I've never had so much flavor in every bite. \"Wow!\" It was definitely worth the hefty $21 price. The tamale was also very flavorful, especially the sauce. The shrimps were quite large and scrumptious. The tamale was very moist and you could taste the corn in it. Sauce was amazing. Between the two, the tacos win hands down.",

The lobster tacos are super small, no more than 2 inches long, it's amazing how much flavor can be packed into these tiny little things. Also go the blue corn pancake (thin like a crepe) with duck breast, sweet and tangy with just enough heat, there's some Asian fusion flavors mixed in there that I love. For entrees we got their signature pork tenderloin and coffee rubbed filet mignon. The beef was cooked to perfection! I have a weakness for the perfect steak, but I never knew pork can be so tender at medium too! It was amazing, both dishes were about equal in flavor, a little bit of heat, which is balanced out with the side of sweet corn tamale. Definitely coming back here next time!",

Our waiter was kind enough to bring us regular French bread since my dad didn't like the flavored ones.   The main dishes do not come with any sides. I recommend the cilantro mashed potatoes and the baked potato (horseradish in baked potato is too overpowering though, maybe ask for no horseradish)  We ordered the filet mignon, lamb and salmon. All dishes were fresh and cooked perfectly to our taste.   For dessert, we ordered the coconut cake. I took 2 bites and loved it until my mom dug her fork into the other side of the piece and found a long piece of hair. I informed the waiter, who apologized and took it back. He asked if we wanted to look at the dessert menu again. We said no.  He did not even offer to bring another piece of hairless coconut cake on the house. How rude for such a pricey restaurant with a well known chef.",

It was an expensive lunch, but we really wanted to try a Bobby Flay restaurant and with very good service and fine food I'll err on the more positive side.   Nothing really impressed us, but nothing was bad either. We liked the goat cheese queso best (but the blue corn tortilla chips were borderline stale so that spoiled it a bit). Felt strange (and very 90s) to get a bread basket - I would have expected a more tex mex chips and salsa thing but whatever.   The bacon quesadilla was flavorful but the queso buffet felt more like a Blue Apron meal then a restaurant burger (uneven cook didn't help).   Bathroom in the restaurant was super clean and the kitchen looked really clean and organized too.   If you're a Flay fan and not very price sensitive, it's a fine spot for lunch.",

We ordered the tiger shrimp, red chili barbecue duck, 16 spice chicken, the pork tenderloin, and the chile crusted rabbit. You can't go wrong with any of these, as they as amazing in presentation and in taste. If you're part of a smaller dining party, be sure to get the pork tenderloin - it is a must! Service was very attentive and accommodating  TIP: Order the pork tenderloin medium, as suggested by the waiting staff. One of the members of my party ordered it well done, and it was definitely too tough at that point.",

I grew up in the Southwest and love all the ingredient from their menu but I have never experienced them so masterfully prepared. From the jalapeno bread to the creamy tamales... just wow. All the ingredient I took for granted while growing up (and that other chefs ignore) they bring to life. Recently we discovered they make a great mezcal peach margarita.    Service is friendly, fun, and professional and we have never been disappointed with a meal here. If this place ever closed down I might loose interest in Las Vegas completely.

They had me take my hat off; whatever, but, there were several other diners inside with hats, so, it seemed selective as to the employees choice.   The menu was limited and seemed to highlight a key ingredient; so, if you don't like the main ingredient you're likely out of luck.  Overall, the reason for the low reviews is every employee seemed angry, and definitely not welcoming. They all seemed like they didn't want to be there and didn't want me and my family to be there.   Butter for the bread was way to hard to use, and had to ask for bread.  We were seated at a large round table for our small group; which was fairly award putting distance between our party.  Good luck if you come.  I can't imagine this will be around long, if staff portrays this attitude consistently.",

Our server was attentive and professional.    For my entree I ordered the Grilled Mahi Mahi and a side of the roasted corn.  The rating I am giving is purely based on the quality of the food and has nothing to do with the price (with my full acknowledgement that this is a strip casino restaurant bearing a celebrity chef name which just does not lend itself to be judged on whether food is worth the price).  The piece of fish on my plate itself was really good, but the Green Chile Rice and Mole sauce that accompanied the dish were not that great, while the separate side of roasted corn was tasty but definitely not a five-star dish.",

A lil upscale, but not too fancy, many people were dressed in normal clothes. It's a lil expensive but a great place to try out. It's not really a family style type of place where you can share a bunch of dishes cause they plates are pretty small. But a great place for a date maybe or a small group. It's a little hard to find, it's located right across from the colosseum and next to the old homestead steakhouse.  Let me tell you... the prawns and sweet corn tamale was amazing !!!! It was surrounded by this sweet corn sauce and the shrimp was so delicious. It was an amazing touch of sweet and savoury. $19 bucks for just the 1 tamale as an appetizer but I've honestly tasted any tamale as good as this one before. Next time I'd honestly get like 3 of these and add extra shrimp, it's that good.   We also had the shishito pepper appetizer. It was good, we got a few spicy ones. Then for the meal we got the plantain tamale as a side (it's small), corn starch chili regano, and the braised short rib which wasn't on the menu it was a special for the night. Everything was delicious but the sweet corn tamale with prawns was by far my favorite.",

I've described a lot of pork as \"dry and chewy\" but this was the exact opposite. I ordered the duck breast and it was everything I wanted it to be and more. I rarely order duck but the side was a chorizo and goat cheese tamale (!) was too enticing to pass up; it's too bad that was a bit too dry, but the breast made up for it. My other friend ordered the coffee crusted filet mignon, which was super tasty. The pork portion was huge, but the duck was pretty small. So, that was a tad disappointing. The desserts were pretty good (banana cream pie & apple pie), but nothing out of this world at all.  Beware, some of the food is very spicy (duh), which I love but some people could grow tired of the tastebud assault.   The drinks are ridiculously tasty and strong, though a bit overpriced. The cactus pear margarita was striking and tasted even better.   Even Bobby Flay haters won't be disappointed, trust me.",

This bread basket is actually worth the entire visit alone.  all 8 of us were satisfied (minus the pork sandwich), and left completely full and in a food coma wandering around the forum shops. thank you bobby flay for the 5lbs i gained and a delicious meal. i believe in you & your bbq grill.",

    "text": "Overall: Hit or miss, but the hits are fantabulamazing! Visits: one, lunch  Breads - They give you a basket with a couple different types of bread. Nice! Something for everyone. The best of the bunch was the jalapeno cheese bread. LOVED it. Cornbread really was very crumbly, and it was also slightly salty, which was odd. I like my cornbread sweet, thanks.  Blue Corn Pancake - Eh. Thought the sauce was a little weird....  Tiger Prawn Tamale - Oh man was that delicious. And the corn was so yummy, but it's really filling so be careful with that one as an appetizer.  Sophie's salad - Great! I love fruity dressings and cheese.  Crab pancakes - You certainly do get a lot of crab, but I wasn't wowed by it. Very filling.  Pork tenderloin - I don't know if it was supposed to be cold, but I don't like my meat cold unless it is sandwich \"meat\". Had an interesting flavor, but eh.  Cuban burger - SOOOOO GOOOOOOOD. I don't even like mustard (I told the waiter no dijon, and he said that was the one thing they couldn't take out...) but man was that burger good. I didn't even really taste the dijon.  Spicy chicken and sweet potato hash - Okay, so I don't know if it's just me, but when I see \"hash\" I think like hash browns or maybe some sort of sweet potato fries... What we got was more like \"mash,\" and it was actually mixed in with the chicken.  Kind of gross in my opinion.  Really sweet, not spicy at all.  Coconut layer cake - TO DIE FOR. So moist and delicious. And you get a gigantic slice. Enough for two or more people depending on how full you are.  Chocolate creme brulee with blueberry compote - OMNOMNOMNOM.  The chocolate at the bottom of the creme brulee really makes it even better.",

We were immediately seated - decor was fun, bright colors, almost lounge like. We had such a hard time deciding what to eat from the brunch menu. The mango carrot (I believe that was the mixture - could have been orange carrot) juice was Delicious! Totally fresh.  To start, we shared the Queso Fundido. So indulgent! Yummy! If you like goat cheese, you will love this plate of bubbly-deliciousness. Next, I got the Chilaquilas. They were pretty spot on. The flavors were bold and deep - and all tied together well. We all loved our experience.  Go Bobby!",

    "text": "I am a huge Bobby Flay fan.  I have 3 of his cookbooks, including the Mesa Grill Cookbook.  I had pretty high expectations for my dinner here... and was NOT disappointed.  Aesthetically, this restaurant is beautiful.  The hand blown glass lighting in bright colors interspersed throughout the restaurant was beautiful, and tastefully placed.  Coupled with wood and copper, I really loved the atmosphere here.  At Bobby Flay's restaurant I would expect service to be top notch... and it was.  Never a less then half full water, and prompt clearing of plates or refilling of bread.  Our waiter was very knowledgeable of the food, and wine pairings, which is a must with this caliber of restaurant.  My girls and I started off with a round of White Peach Margaritas.  All I can say is... wow... best... margarita... ever... seriously.  For an appetizer we ordered the Goat Cheese Queso Fundido.  Delicious!  I'm a pretty big queso fan, along with goat cheese, so the marrying of the two was amazing for me.  I also really enjoyed the basket of bread, brought to every table once drinks were served.  There were 3 types of bread: a jalapeno-cheddar sourdough, and 2 others.  (You can tell which one I absolutely LOVED.)  For dinner I just had to order the Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops:  Tangerine-Roasted Jalapeno-Mint Sauce w/ a Plantain Tamale with Molasses Butter.  The lamb was cooked at a perfect medium... tender, flavorful, and absolutely delicious.  One of the best lamb dishes I have ever had.  The tamale was nothing to write home about, but I had plenty of lamb to fill me up, that It wasn't a huge deal.  I also had bites of my friends' steak and pork tenderloin dishes... both equally amazing (well, maybe not AS good, because they weren't lamb).  We got a couple side dishes to share as well: 1.) Chorizo-Goat Cheese Tamale w/ Thyme Butter, and 2.) Roasted Corn, Smoked Chiles, Cotija Cheese w/ Lime.  Again, the tamale was just okay... all the tamales kind of tasted alike for me.  But the corn... on my god, the corn.  We fought over the last few morsels of food left in that dish.  This is one of those dishes that you bring up days later: \"Remember that corn dish from Mesa Grill?  Oh, that was sooo good!\".  I checked my Mesa Grill cookbook the day I got home, and found the recipe in it!  And yes, I recently made it... pretty damn close to the real thing!  So for me, a restaurant that lives up to its expectations is pretty rare.  But this place did it.  When you have a name like Bobby Flay behind you, everything needs to be spot on.  Of course some things were better then others, but the over experience was definitely deserving of 5-stars.",

I would stay away from the blue corn pancake app with bbq duck, it is extremely heavy on the bbq sauce, can't even taste the duck!  The seafood entrees are top notch! I highly recommend the halibut in particular, always cooked to perfection. For sides try the chile relleno. Save room for dessert too, they're worth it.  A major tip - go here for lunch instead of dinner and save big $$$. The lunch menu has most of the highlights of the dinner menu for a lot less! (the halibut for example is $24 at lunch, $36 at dinner)",

We were seated in the very booth Bourdain and Ruhlman sat in during the Mesa portion of Bourdain's Vegas episode.   The appetizers we ordered were devastating. The Yucatan chicken tacos were grilled perfection, with a tangy, piquant BBQ peanut sauce, just the right temperature. The goat cheese queso fundido was a great counterpoint: warm, gooey and full of great flavor. Unreal.   I will also say that the bartender KNOWS his cocktails. This place is top shelf, and I will say I've never tasted a better Belvedere Gibson.   The rib-eye was simply masterful. Among the two best steaks I've ever had (other was at Grill 23 here in B-town) and the birthday dude agreed, as he got the same thing.   Atmosphere is fun, swanky, hip and interesting - loud without being overwhelming, nice tiered layout to the place gives the appearance of a bigger room, and the open kitchen design makes you feel connected to your food experience.   I loved this place, and would recommend it to anyone traveling to Vegas for any reason. Bon!",

    "text": "Bobby Flay can round out a pretty good meal.  I came here twice and both times, the service was excellent.  They knew their menu inside-out and weren't afraid to say if something was just \"eh.\"  I tried the Tiger Shrimp Tamale which wasn't incredible but I give B-Flay props for his creativity.  And then I had the Coffee Filet Mignon which was excellent.  I feared the coffee flavor would be overbearing and it would taste like a failed Dunkin' Donuts experiment but it was seasoned just enough to know that it was coffee, not a bit more.  The second time around -- not on my company's dime this time -- I ordered the Mango Tuna Steak.  Now, I feel that this dish is the epitome of B-Flay's amalgamations.  The dish was part mango (which seems to be his vice), cous cous (some far-out non-traditional ingredient), and chile sauce (the token traditional ingredient) on a somewhat off-kilter meat like tuna (because cow is never good enough for Flay).  The decor was pretty cool.  Somehow, they managed to pull the \"I'm on a plateau but it's fun\" look.  Plus, Mesa Grill logo is pure marketing genius.  My co-workers were pretty sick of my running commentary on the restaurant logo.  \"Dude, Bobby must have his MBA because that logo is so cool.  Does Bobby have his MBA?  Guys?  Guys?\"  I should comment that the prices aren't for the faint of heart.  If I weren't on full-throttle spend mode, being in Vegas, I probably would've balked at the menu.  I hadn't gotten into the Food Channel before I visited Mesa Grill so I didn't really care for chef Robby Fleghue or whomever.  I would probably appreciate the place much more now that I'm a full-on Food Channel junkie.  All-in-all, it was pretty cool and the food was very good.",

    "text": "Have you ever watched \"Beat Bobby Flay\" on the Food Network?  It's almost impossible to beat him.  His skill level, along with his penchant for making dishes with some heat are two of the reasons he's my favorite celebrity Chef....so I have been looking for the right time to visit his place, the Mesa Grill.   We missed our reservation...We thought we were getting there 20 minutes early but instead we're 40 minutes late.  #TimeChangeCalculationError.   Lol.  But Team Flay was very accommodating.  After a brief wait, we were seated.   The meal started with a trio of warm bread in a basket. There was a nut and raisin option and a couple of slices with peppers. But the show stealer was the corn muffin which stole the show. It was made of both blue and yellow corn meal which added a different taste and filled with corn and red peppers.  I ate two.   The appetizers we chose were the Tiger Shrimp Corn Tamale and grilled Shishito Peppers with a Mango dipping sauce....They both delivered.  The tamale was smooth and silky and covered in a phenomenal cream sauce and the shrimp were perfectly cooked.  The peppers were tasty, seasoned with what looked like  Himalayan Sea Salt and dusted with other seasonings.    The entrees were Bobby's signature rubbed Pork Tenderloin and the Grilled Salmon. I hardly ever order Pork but since this is one of his signature dishes. I had to try it.  It was A-MA-ZING.   Expertly cooked by the chefs and flavorful.  The spice rub on the outside gave a slight bit of heat which married perfectly with the colorful sauces on the plate.   The pork came with another slightly sweet tamale that was also quite flavorful.   The side dish was a Cilantro Pesto Mashed Potatoes.  It was so good that I forgot to take a picture.   I did not taste the salmon but we sent the plate back empty so it must have been amazing too.   Add in generous alcohol pours, a great margarita...and a bill that was $50 less than one of my favorites in Philly, The Palm, and it turns into an experience to write home about...I mean Yelp",

I had reservations for two but had to pick my friend up from the airport and knew I'd be cutting it close if nothing went wrong. Well, something did - bags not arriving quickly enough, way more than normal heavy traffic, couldn't find parking for my oversized vehicle - all of which meant that we were going to be late for our reservation time. I called the restaurant to explain the situation and they assured me that they would hold our table for us. And they did! For almost a half hour!  The food was delicious, the margaritas were perfect, the service was exceptional, the ambiance delightful. We could not have asked for anything more. My friend and I had Pink Cactus Margaritas, which were one of the special drinks offered that night, and a plate of Charred Shishito Peppers with a Mango Agro Dolce dipping sauce. Both were spectacularly perfect in every way. Our entrees were the Ancho Chile-Honey Glazed Salmon with a side Sweet Potato Gratin,  and the Sixteen Spice Chicken with Apricot Butter Mashed Potatoes. Both dishes were done to excellence and more tasty than I can even describe here. (I'm licking my lips just writing this review!) The salmon was moist and juicy (read that: not cooked to death!), and the chicken was roasted in such a way as to retain its juiciness and was not dried out at all. Suffice it to say, we thoroughly enjoyed our dinner and would definitely return again.",

I've been a fan for years, and going to this restaurant really makes me not want to try any of his other ones. I don't mind the price I actually think it's on the more affordable side compared to other fine dining restaurants. However the flavors are just lacking, the Chile relleno wasn't very tasty, I asked for a modification and the waiter told me they couldn't do it because everything is already prepared before hand. Which means they hold everything ready to just heat up. I know this is common in restaurants with high demand however it was lonely and it's also fine dining so they should prepare it for you, fresh! My husband ordered the salmon it was okay, both of our meals tasted like they had canned sauces in them, nothing special. I'm sure Bobby flat doesn't cook like this, I wish he trained his chefs better, so that his restaurants can actually represent him. The coconut cake was okay, tasted a little bit old it was super crumbly and the frosting layer was coming off with a splitting cake.",

The restaurant had a nice ambiance and although very crowded it didn't make you feel that way.  The service was some of  the best we have experienced.  Our waiter was excellent giving both his thoughts and the favorites making our choices easy.   The shrimp tamale appetizer was perfect, completely blowing by  our expectations and was perfectly paired with the house margarita.   One of the house favorites,the New Mexican spice rubbed pork, was cooked to perfection and shared across the table as we both couldn't get enough of it.    The fire roasted veal chop was recommended by our server and it did not disappoint.  It was nice to eat something off the beaten path and it had all the flavor you would expect at a BF restaurant.   Both meals were paired well with unique tamales which complimented the proteins on the plate. Bringing more flavor into the tasting experience.  Did I mention the bread... it was dropped soon after sitting and had 3 different types each unique and flavorful... they were a treat .   The service team managed our experience with ease. Never rushing. Everything showing exactly on time and with impeccable care.    And yes we splurged on 2 desserts even though we couldn't finish them. The banana cream was good ... fresh and delicious.... but the toast of the evening goes to the chocolate sticky toffee pudding.  Possibly of our best desserts ever!!!   Just wished the scoop of ice cream wasn't the size of a Mellon ball... but that would only complaint of the evening.    So glad we started off our vacation T your amazing restaurant...  hats off the chef and whole team at Mesa grill .",

    "text": "Bobby Flay has been one of my celebrity chef crushes ever since I discovered Food Network and I have always wanted to try out his food because of his Southwestern flair and bold flavors. Since I'll probably never be fortunate enough to actually eat anything prepared by Bobby Flay himself I'll have to settle for eating at his restaurants thus Mesa Grill was an obvious choice for dining in Las Vegas. Located in Caesars Palace near the Omnia Nightclub - this is not a restaurant to pass up. Even the complimentary \"bread\" basket had some Southwestern flair in its biscuits and muffin.   The infamous Tiger Shrimp + Roasted Corn Tamale was absolutely delicious. The dish comes with one tamale and 4 perfectly cooked shrimps. The tamale had a great texture and didn't have a hint of dryness. The roasted garlic sauce was unbelievably tasty and just the right amount of creamy - SO much flavor. This is a MUST order! Since we came at 11am on a Saturday, we were given the brunch menu. I really wanted to try his New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin entree but settled for the New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich since that was the closest thing. Bobby Flay loves his ancho chile and chile de arbol so that rub on the pork was wonderfully sweet with a slight kick. The pork was very tender and had a great overall flavor. The sandwich was solid and well balanced. The Certified Angus Beef Prime New York Strip Steak & Egg Tortilla was a fun and delicious dish as well. You basically make your own breakfast tacos with the steak, eggs, onions, peppers, avocados and a cream sauce. The steak was beautifully cooked and just brings your breakfast taco to a new level.",

I will say, though, that it's not necessarily the most vegetarian friendly place - which is probably not surprising since it's Bobby Flay.  They have an excellent bread basket, which may or may not spoil your meal (it will). Their margarita's are excellent. I've had the double backed potato which was amazing with just the right amount of horseradish. The brussel sprouts are quite good, though admittedly not my favourite vegetable. The cilantro pesto mashed potatoes will likely leave you wanting more. The one side I have had that was slightly less impressive was the cauliflower gratin, which we thought was a little greasy.   On my last visit, my dining companion ordered the Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin. It looked like it was perfectly cooked, and she said it was like nothing she'd ever had before.  I say give it a shot, it's a great location, good food, nice atmosphere.",

    "text": "Mesa grill is a little bit of a mess.  I have to start with the decor. Normally I don't care because, after all, I'm here for the food, but the interior of Mesa looks like and avant garde circus crashed into Guy Fieri's set. Some of the lamps are flames, there are flames drawn on parts of the ceiling, yet the entrance has multiple layers of glass with abstract dot patterns. What? I've lived in the SouthWest for 28 years, and I got the sense that a overpaid New York interior designer who had never visited the SouthWest came up with this.  Now that would be fine and well if the food was a home run, but if you could put the sad trombone sound on a plate, Mesa would be it. It started at check-in. Right behind the hostess is a fairly prominent sign with the dress code. Typical stuff: No flip flops, no board shorts, no hats for men. Right behind that, is a stand selling Mesa branded hats for men. Right behind that was a 20 year old bro wearing a backwards baseball cap. Riiighhtt...  We're shown to our table where we meet the most unenthusiastic waiter of our entire trip. It was painfully obvious that the guy wanted to be anywhere-but-here. He showed up exactly three times: once to take our order, once to bring our food, and once to bring us the check. Of those three, the closest he got to human emotion was when he brought us the check.  We started with the queso fundido, which was actually delicious, but let's be honest, serving melted cheese is basically like making pizza. As long as you don't set it on fire, it's going to pretty good. The fundido has goat cheese, so it doesn't congeal the instant it cools which is pretty nifty.  The bread basket was the highlight of the meal. I just realized what a horrific statement that is as I typed it, but nonetheless it's True. The blue corn cornbread was amazing; fluffy, just the right amount of density and mealy flavor.   The tuna nachos were serviceable. I was hoping for a bit of citrus to brighten up the fish a bit, but it was a competent appetizer.   The entrees were the weakest part of the meal. My pork tenderloin sandwich was just okay. The arugula wasn't peppery at all, though I didn't hate the mayo, which is a minor miracle. The side of fries was heavily seasoned, but crispy.   My wife had the lamb and ended up picking most of it out of here cobb salad, which at least had a generous helping of bleu cheese. Neither plate was terrible, but at $18-22 each, you would hope to aim higher than \"not terrible.\"   Perhaps I've been spoiled by years of legitimate Tex-mex, but the food was too inconsistent, and the competition in Vegas too fierce for us to want to return to Mesa.",

My friend had dined there once before and really enjoyed it so we decided to give it try even though we didn't have reservations. The wait was about 30min but for a weekend evening, that's not bad at all.   We didn't want to be bloated for the flight so the server was kind enough to let us share a few dishes family style. I was worried she would be frustrated with us or something but she was very accommodating to our request.   The Tiger Shrimp and Corn Tamale appetizer was on point and was probably my favorite dish of the evening. The side of Roasted Brussels Sprouts was tasty and full of flavor. The main entree we ordered was the Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops served with a plantain tamale. I'm not a big fan of lamb but I enjoyed it more that I thought I would - great flavor profile.   Overall, it was a solid and satisfying meal - I wouldn't expect anything less from a restaurant with an Iron Chef's name attached to it. I like the colorful decor and casual ambiance so that you can have fancy food without feeling like servers are breathing down your throat. This is definitely worth a return visit - hopefully next time we bring our appetites more!   Side note: They have really nice bathroom napkins - super fancy and soft that I felt so guilty throwing it away haha!",

It was the best salad I've ever had. The dressing was absolutely amazing!  I had the tuna steak. It was cooked perfectly and was very flavorful. My husband had the pork tenderloin. It was equally delicious. It was very flavorful and had the perfect amount of spice. We shared a side of brussel sprouts...I highly recommend. We had one of the best dining experiences ever. We will definitely return next time we are in Vegas. Way to go Bobby Flay!!",

    "text": "My rating is 5 for service, 1.5 for food, 3 for atmosphere. The decor of the entrance is off-putting... looks embarrasing but inside its so so nice- the food is probably awesome to the masses.  The atmosphere is ok, for the space, the tables are a little close together : the last reservation is at 2:15, but they do not rush you whatsoever, that's great service!  I got a margarita which was the same taste as what you might get at PF Changs, but it also cost the same so whatever. -on the menu it says fresh lime and triple sec but I think +cheap margarita mix... and then what's the point :(  The alcohol menu is a couple of pages but I don't think there is a full bar. No champaign by the glass, there was a cocktail list but very limited. They have like 20 different tequilas tho!   Our waiter was awesome! The receptionist lady was great too, I just called to see if they cater to vegans which they do, provided you let them know in advance.  I asked what the best things are on the menu- he gave us ample choices and we decided to get an appetizer to share and an entree each respectively:  tamale chile relliano  mahi mahi  You get a bread basket with 3 things! Cornbread muffin, jalapeno cheese french bread, and walnut raisin denser bread.  I am usually gluten-free but whatever, so I ate the cornbread, I'm gonna say that was THE BEST THING I ATE THERE but I really like carbs so I'm biased.  All the plates were unique and fun. Espresso was good too.",

    "text": "I finally made it into Mesa Grill this weekend. My friend was always raving about their food and margaritas, so I was very excited to finally get to try it for myself. My boyfriend and I stopped by for brunch and we were pleasantly surprised. They brought out a bread basket while we waited for our appetizer. The bread was delicious! There were tiny jalapeno biscuits, cornbread, blueberry cake and a raisin scone. Everything was perfect. The bread was warm and very fresh. I could seriously eat like 10 of those jalapeno biscuits!    We ordered the Goat Cheese Queso Fundido as our appetizer. So good! The cheese was topped with red and green peppers. They served it with some light and crispy blue corn chips. I'm already craving this again...  For my entree I ordered the Scrambled Eggs Chilaquiles. They were pretty good, but very different from the chilaquiles I'm used to eating. The tomatillo salsa was good, but my favorite part was the side of hominy grits. They were very flavorful!  My boyfriend ordered the Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash. It was SO good! If you like sweet potatoes, you will love this dish. It was the perfect balance of sweet and spicy.   We didn't save room for dessert, so we will have to go back one of these days to give that a try. Mesa Grill is a place I can certainly see myself visiting again. I have to try their White Peach Margarita, after all!",

I had a super crush on him (damn you Stephanie March) and was super excited in 2000 when I went to Mesa Grill in 2000. At the time, it was probably one of the best meals I had ever had. Literally.   Fast-forward some years and I decided to check out the Mesa Grill in Las Vegas. It was a while ago that we went but I had the fish and my husband had a steak. Obviously we drank margaritas. The food was really good, but not exceptional like I recalled. I think they kind of went overboard with the condiments. Although not super authentic, I would say that this is still better quality food than most Mexican places on the strip and would kinda compare it to Rick Bayless.",

    "text": "Two Excellent Meals in One Week!  After a late lunch last Saturday with my adult son, we decided to return today and were not disappointed. The food is prepared well, with seasonings that do not overtake the food but compliment it. The presentation is perfect, as some of the pictures on this site try to depict.    Fresh and delicious specialty bread items were brought to the table, including a jalapeno corn muffin, small sweet muffin, and a blueberry type bread in small amounts for each person. Perfect.   An appetizer of smoked salmon quesadilla was shared and enjoyed immensely. The light touch of fresh dill creme Fraiche added a contrast to the smoky salmon and restrained use of cheese so that all flavors were both full yet balanced.   Sweet Potato Clam Chowder was absolutely the best use of sweet potatoes in a soup that I have had, and I've tried many.   The Tiger Shrimp / Roasted Corn Tamale had a delicious cilantro sauce with 4 tender perfectly cooked shrimp.  Once again the flavors were well balanced.   Spicy Chicken/ Sweet potato hash molded into cups each held a poached egg with Green Chile Hollandaise and a side of grits, was said to be delicious (not mine and no tastes?)   Service is polite, attentive, helpful, and had an eye on the table, which allowed water to be refreshed before the glass was emptied, plates to be cleared, and after bites of the food were enjoyed, a check on our satisfaction followed. We were informed of specials, asked if we wanted alcoholic drinks, dessert/coffee, but not pushed.   The entire restaurant (dining area, restroom, entry area) is beautifully designed in burnished and hammered copper, stone, and lighting elements that attracted my artistic eye. Music was at a low level so that a conversation was possible, yet if quietly savoring the flavors, it was a gentle presence.    I will be returning on my next visit to my son in the Vegas Area.",

    "text": "I took my very deserving bf to this place for his birthday. Best advice: #1) Get reservations.  #2) Go for lunch or breakfast #3) ask questions before ordering the first thing that calls to you.  I went after having read the menu and Yelp reviews but * in spite of reading the yelp reviews. I'll admit my expectations were low and it was better than I expected but to say I'd go back... eh. probably not. there are too many restaurants in town to say I'd go back. But my bf loves B.Flay and he was happy so thats all that matters.  APPETIZER: Queso fundido.. How can you go wrong with creamy ovenhot cheese w/ chips? We both agreed this was the best thing and star of the night. If I had it to do over again I'd have ordered 2 apps for my dinner.and called it a night.   ENTREE: I ordered the 16 spice chicken mole. Really good but it had the skin on it which I never eat skin on chicken - and peeled it off, which also peels of the great 16 spice chicken ..but the mole was good.  My bf ordered the pork tenderloin which so did the lady sitting next to us - literally I could have hit my neighbor @ the nxt table in the ribs without leaning over. YEP it was that close.   SIDES: my bfs plate came with some kind of tamale - dry. I ordered the pumpkin spice tamale as a side: dry w/ too much star of anise. thats all I could taste. IT all sounds good in theory, but its not. I dont recall what else my bf ordered as a side... guess u could say it was forgettable.   No drinks or dessert and tab was $110. Nope.. could have had 2 awesome dinners elsewhere for that price, not including tip to the waitress who was great.  Felt kinda bad for the staff b/c they looked like ants in a farm - everyone doing something so dillitgently but there's so many- they must rely on tips that or thats why the prices are so high.   As I left couldnt help but wish I'd gone to one of the other restaurants in the Forum Shops. Hell, even Cheesecake factory tasted better.  But I give 3 stars - one for service, one for creativity for different tasting dishes. and 2 for ambiance. but I take away for having to practially sit in my neighbors chair with him (now I know who they watch on tv and who they are fans of in the NFL and why their daughter doesnt want to finish college)   TIP#4)Oh yeah and if you dont make ur reservation (must cancel by 3PM) and if u dont make it or dont cancel its $50 a person !!  TIP#5)if you are not a member of the caesars palace points thing - you have to give ur credit card info to even make that reservation so they can charge accordingly.  So its just as pricy to go as it is not to go.",

Service - spot on, our waitress was a joy to have - if we could have - we would have asked her to join us. I wish I knew her name. We liked her so much, my husband proposed to her with a corn husk tie from his corn tamale.  The food was outstanding, I had the sweet potatoe soup to start, and had my meal ended there I would have been ecstatic, but lucky for me, there was more to come. The bread selection (yes there was a selection of three different breads) was great - jalapeno asiago bread was a big A+ for me.  My entree was the grilled mahi mahi - and it was PERFECT, just a little heat, so much flavor it was a party in my mouth that I didn't want to have end.  If you are on the strip you have to go here.",

The sauce was delicious underneath the warm, hot tamale.   The bread basket was also something that stood out. The blue corn muffin was soft but yet crumbly and me and my husband couldn't help but ask for seconds. in addition, the jalapeno bread and the raisin bread were so good we gobbled up the whole basket within a few minutes.  as for the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork tenderloin was not as memorable. It was served cold, and the sauce inside was good, as well as the toasted bread but the tenderloin taste got lost in the sandwich. Would definitely come back and try some of Bobby Flay's other dishes. The fries were VERY well seasoned and so crunchy and flavorful.  We also got the ancho chile honey glazed salmon that was medium. It was tender, and melt-in-your mouth good. Highly recommend his restaurant. i wasn't originally a Bobby Flay fan, but now I give him all the credit.",

The order:  Tiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale (appetizer) Fire Roasted Veal Chop (main course for me) 22 oz Bone in Chipotle Glazed Rib eye (main course for the boyfriend)  We started on our appetizers with high expectations for it, being that it was raved about in almost every yelp review.  This was not over hyped.  It was sweet and savory, perfect way to start off your meal! I just wish there were more prawns! i think it came with 3? But it was cooked to pefection!   Our entrees came shortly after our appetizer was finished.... le sigh, i'm salivating as I am conjuring up all the delightful tastes of that night.  Must go back soon!  Ok, back to reality.... My Veal chop was cooked perfectly! Seasoned just right to bring out the maple glaze, horseradish and sage flavors one by one. The meat was tender, but it wasn't melt in your mouth tender. The presentation was fabulous with the bone on the Veal chop still in tact and the tamale resting under the chop.   Although my veal chop was perfect, my boyfriend's 22 oz rib eye was BETTER!! SIGHH.... now this, was melt in your mouth tender! The flavors were explosive, like-- little tiny flavor mines exploding in yo mouth. Their chipotle glaze and green and red chili sauce... is in comparable to any other steak sauce that i have ever had..  I am sooo getting this next time.   5 stars, i'd give it 10 if i could..!!!",

    "text": "I had the pleasure of eating at Mesa Grill in the Bahamas and enjoyed ever bite. The food was spectacular and the steaks were cooked and seasoned perfectly. The service was also a top notch experience.   Now on to Vegas: While on a mini family vacation (cheer tournament) in Vegas with my wife and kids I thought it would be great for the family to enjoy what I had the opportunity to enjoy in Bahamas. After checking yelp and calling ahead to see when Mesa closed we promptly arrived at 10:30. After hustling my kids by the questionable statues in Caesars the Romans call art. Did I also mention that we passed Nobu's and Rao's on our way to Mesa. All because I thought my family would enjoy what I fell in love with in the Bahamas.    After being greeted by the receptionist she politely informed me that the Resturant was closed for the night (Saturday) and all of waiters that could serve us were let go early. I asked her politely is there anyway that someone could serve us because my family and I traveled 400 miles just to eat at Mesa grill. She politely smiled and said no. At this time my family was hunger crabby and looked at me like \"we should have stopped at some sub par Resturant on the strip\". After walking away defeated like I just climbed Mount Rushmore with no one to greet me at the top I walked outside with my family and reviewed the hours of operation that said \"Mesa grill closes at 11pm\". I then walked back into the restaurant and asked again politely to someone standing by the polite hostess and they finally said OK.   Bobby if your reading this.... I love your food that much to walk back in the same Resturant that turned away my family of five away before official closing hours.   Thank goodness for the second hostess/ manager who seated us. In addition the food was spectacular and the service was incredible. The server saved the day for me. Just couldn't believe that the hostess was ready to turn away a $450 check.",

    "text": "Great potential, poor execution. Our server was neither good nor nice - had a bad attitude for no apparent reason. The food was very tasty - sauces quite balanced with depth and interest. However the portion sizes of some items were ridiculously small. For example, the chicken skewers and the chili relleno dishes were less than half of what should be presented for a lunch meal - more like a 5-bite \"lunch.\" However for the same price, the burger and the salmon BLT dishes were HUGE - twice the size they needed to be, and served with a side. Overall the place seemed tired and uninspired. Would love to have had a different experience but didn't. Maybe it was just an off day. But it didn't feel like it was that.",

Have dined at Mesa Grill twice now, with an impending trip again next month. Have been once for brunch and once for dinner.  Chilaquiles and a burger at brunch. GF thought the chilaquiles were off the chart good, the burger also was good. One of the strengths here are the sauces. The jalapeno cheese rolls are definitely a winner. For dinner, the Pork Tenderloin is a tremendous dish as well as the signature tamale with grilled shrimp. Some sort of deconstructed berry cobbler for dessert was also very good.  At both visits we indulged in the best restaurant margaritas we have ever had. One can choose from a pretty wide variety of tequilas to include.  The service has been exemplary. Top notch. No complaints, which is high praise.",

I took my friend here who I have to say is a very \"plain\" eater - think cereal & turkey sandwiches. So to come here was a big stretch for her. We both ordered margaritas - one original & one white peach - both were delicious & strong :) She had the chicken taco appetizer (which I tried) and it was nicely presented, well seasoned and I loved the peanut bbq sauce - yum. I ordred the blue corn duck pancake (basically a duck taco) - the duck was fantastic. I ordered an entree (which I sort of split with my friend) which was the ancho chili rubbed pork tenderloin with a sweet potato tamale - excellent. My pork was cooked perfected - the rub and the sauce was delicious. This certainly will not be my last visit to Mesa Grill. I've never been disappointed.",

I had the Salmon, which was very tasty.  Such a delicate smokey flavor it had.  The duck appetizer was good but a bit too sweet for my tastes.  The chicken tacos were tasty as well, but are better suited as an appetizer than an entree.  Many types of margaritas to choose from and lots of good tequilas.  I would go back.",

    "text": "I went to Vegas a couple of weeks ago and was treated to Mesa Grill by some friends.  This was the second time I had been to the restaurant, the first time being about 7 years ago.  I had fond memories of Mesa Grill from the past, but was slightly disappointed this time around.  Since I was not paying, I only ordered an entree, so I ordered the ribeye.  The meat was perfectly cooked to medium ( the server suggested this instead of medium rare)  ... it looked like medium rare to me anyway.  Perhaps, she was heading off some potential problem that the cooks might have been having with undercooking meat?  The steak was flavorful, but could have been accompanied with more of the sauces that came along side of it.  My only issue with the steak was that it did not come with accompaniments.  Every other entree selection (besides the filet) came with a side dish or tamale of some sort.  For $48, I expected something.  The waitress suggested that we order a couple of sides to split, so we got the corn and the spinach.  Both portions were TINY and really could not be split unless your idea of splitting them is a tablespoon serving per person.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable although a bit condescending... maybe that is not the best word...  over-confident perhaps?  Anyway, she was ok but kind of icy.  The others at my table had the veal chop and pork tenderloin.",

When we did get the bread basket, it wasn't as great as she remembered it to be... she said they changed it up... I wasn't too impressed with it either... I just took a bite out of every type in the basket to see what the hype was about.  For appetizer we shared the Salmon and Tuna Tartares, which we were told was new to the menu... it was served with deep fried plantains and on the menu it said blue corn flatbread, but we had one small piece of blue corn chip... which I guess was the flatbread... I don't know.  We all ended up getting the Mesa Burger which was really juicy but it was too much burger for me... I ate half of it and I couldn't even pick at the other half...

Went for brunch on a Saturday morning.  Started out the right way with a bloody mary which was really good, although I would have preferred a touch less, just a touch less horseradish.  Next time I'll probably get a \"rita\" although I wouldn't mind if I had another bloody mary.  Took a few minutes to get seated but we didn't have reservations so can't complain too much.  I had the ranch style eggs on a tostada and ancho chile sauce....really delicious.  I was going to get the Spicy Chicken with sweet potato hash, but I wanted something more simple.  It was a much larger portion that I had planned and I almost didn't finish, but I couldn't leave any on my plate, that would have been wrong and not in the True \"food cripple\" style.  Maybe I wouldn't have been so stuffed if I hadn't been devouring the treats in the bread basket.  I won't reiterate what was said by Lindley K., except for...damn that stuff was good.  Read that post about the bread.  My girlfriend had the crab cakes for an entree and was very content.  Sat near the kitchen and could see what the cooks were placing up in the window, and yes, the burger looked really good.  Might have to try that next time.    The waiter was attentive, courteous, and knowledgeable.    If staying at Caesar's, you need to eat here, and you need to consider it if you are staying somewhere else.",

    "text": "i would give this a 3.5 but no halvies. I only went for lunch so I can't rate if it's a 5-er without it.  We (as always if there is a we that means husband and I) went mainly because it's a Bobby Flay restaurant so that swayed us. Also- with so many choices of good places, the menu looked good.  It was an early lunch because we were starvino and just got off the plan a few hours before.  so we had the Wild Mushroom Quesadilla as a starter. As a disclaimer, i think anything with truffle oil tastes good. I also love mushrooms. It was really good- I like the crunch to the  quesadilla and the hummus on a quesadilla was new to me and beats the questionable tomato salsa with the salmonella scare. So-how do you review eating a salad? It's pretty much greens and meat right?  I had the  16 spice chicken salad. The rub on the chicken was pretty flavorful and i've only started ordering chicken at restaurants (personal reasons but sometimes i think eating chicken at restaurants is a waste- but hey it's salad).  Overall it's a good salad and goat cheese is probably my favorite cheese. My husband had the New Mexican spiced pork tenderloin sandwich which was really tender. The fries had a kick to it. To digress (or not) Bobby Flay is all about simple food with lots of flavoring. The husband summed it up that you can either go totally wrong with all the spices or it works.  I think it works for him. Yes- we start drinking once we hit the ground in Vegas. I had a special drink of the day a watermelon margarita...really refreshing and not watered down. there is enough water in the watermelon! Husband is a mojito and wished for more mojitos. The glassware is super cute. I think they gave us 3 kinds of breads, memorable was the spicy jalepeno corn muffin. I watched a Bobby Flay Showdown episode where they had the kentucky browns which he served in his restaurant. I saw it on the menu but thought it would be too heavy for me, so i live in a world of regret. jk Service I can't say much for. We were early so we were jocked and they were very nice and attentive. I thought they were good.  If I were you- i'd try it. If you are waiting in line for Pure- maybe one stooge of a friend can sit there while you enjoy a drink and appie and trade off. If i go back for dinner- i'll revise.",

Service was aloof and sometimes worse in the beginning. A fellow at the bar said \"we don't move the furniture\" as we tried to make space for all of our party. Could have made attempt to not sound like stern father. The margaritas were excellently prepared. Delicious and fresh. On to the food. The bread basket was delectable. Try the corn muffins, you won't want to to stop. I had the chili rubbed pork medallions that were seasoned and cooked to absolute perfection. This dish was an absolute winner. The chili rellenos were a miss. Coating or breading was heavy and hard. I wouldn't let this stop me from going at all, just skip this dish. Tuna was good according to the person in our party who had it though why? in  Bobby Flay restaurant? I'm not sure. We skipped desert in favor of brandy and they had a good selection.",

We arrived around 7pm and their first reservation time for two people wasn't until 9:45pm but we were only in town for about one whole day so we took it.  We hung outside of Caesar's at a bar while we waited for our table and when we showed up at 9:30pm, we finally got seated.  We split a fantastic bottle of the cheapest red zinfandel we could find on the menu and it was well worth the $40!  We shared the queso fundito as an appetizer and it was really great.  The addition of the goat cheese gave it a nice tangy bite and cut the richness just enough.  I ordered the salmon for dinner and it was great as well - cooked perfectly with a nice crust on the outside.  We got some collared greens as a side and they were garlicy and tasty.  Overall it was a good meal and I have to give Bobby some props...even though he seems like kind of a creep in real life.  Well done!",

We had chicken quesadilla. Nothing special. I had better quesadillas. It lacked flavor and had a bad texture. Had salmon and a side dish. I thought the waiter was rude too. He said the salmon dish was too small to share and that we should order more food. I think 2 full appetizers, 2 drinks, one entree and one side is plenty for 2 adults.",

    "text": "Bobby Flay always seems to whip up the types of food I want SHOVED IN MY FACEHOLE. STAT....... on Iron Chef. So I was suuuuper pumped to finally taste his food for lunch. (I know, not even the same realm as his Iron Chef fare. But still.)  I liked the interior. Modern, clean, with clear Southwestern elements thrown in without it being at all kitschy.  On to what's important - the food...  Bread basket: jalapeno asiago bread, corn bread w/jalapeno cilantro and tomato (?), and blueberry walnut [3/5] *** Cold crumbly/dry bread, hard butter. Was especially excited to try the two jalapeno breads and while you couldn't really taste the cheese nor jalapeno in the Jalapeno Asiago bread, the corn bread was pretty darn good.  Blue corn pancake + barbecued duck w/habanero chile - star anise sauce $15 [3/5] *** This was an OK dish. Not too big a fan of the sauce. I think they were trying to work with the concept of a peking duck pancake here but was a little off on the execution. Sounds like it's been on the menu for years so there might be fans out there. I'm just not one of them.  Tiger shrimp + roasted garlic corn tamale w/corn - cilantro sauce $16 [4.5/5] *** The star of the meal. It's got a lot of rave reviews for good reason. It's on point visually, texture-wise, and most importantly, in flavor.   New Mexican spices pork tenderloin sandwich w/grilled red onion, arugula ancho chile mayonnaise + southwestern fries $16 [4/5] *** The ancho chile mayonnaise was mmmgoot. The pork tenderloin had a tasty rub as well. Great flavors.  Overall a solid meal but I probably wouldn't prioritize Mesa over other Vegas favorites. Now..... where do I go in California/Nevada to eat the kind of stuff he cooks on Iron Chef? Or anywhere really?",

But...we also ordered the soup(sweet potato clam bacon). It was amazing,,,except it felt like they split our order with someone else and only gave us a half order.  I kid you not, the soup was only 1/2 inch deep in the bowl.    For $16, it felt like we were really getting ripped off.   It's soup!   Do you really need to be that stingy?  4 people, 2 appetizers, 1 soup, 3 meals(split) no dessert... $240.  A bit expensive imho for this meal.       I love a good meal, but there has to be value and this is starting to feel over-priced",

The entree was the salmon which was beautifully plated, perfectly cooked, and assertively flavored. That fish was one that I will never forget. I ended with the banana cream pie, which again was a visual artistic expression and tasted amazing.

Dinner prices are high and not justified for the mediocre food.  We started with the lobster tacos, the blue corn shell taco shell was probably the best part.  The sauce is a little spicy with nice flavor.  My only problem is that the tacos are very small, and they used shredded lobster meat versus big chunks of lobster.  The lobster lost is flavor, being drowned in the sauce.    I had the spiced pork tenderloin, its actually decent.  Again, the sauce was really the star.  The pork tenderloin did not have a whole lot of flavor, but it was cooked well.  The sweet potato tamale was really good, probably my favorite part of the entree.  Also sampled a side of chile relleno and smoked chicken quesadilla.  Both are very bad.  The side chile relleno was stuffed with black bean, making it very heavy and starchy, you lost all flavor from the chile/cheese because the black bean came out too strong.  The smoked chicken quesdilla was similar, it had a lot of black bean, no cheese, and a very thick tortilla.  So both are basically bland and tasteless.  I guess some items are hit and miss, i just ordered the wrong stuff.  For the prices they charge on dinner $$$, not worth it, i would go elsewhere for a more satisfactory meal.",

Bread Basket ( Free ) - Super yummy ! We really like the blue corn muffin.. it's soft and taste way better than your regular corn bread. The waiter let us get another order of it for free.   Entrees -( Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops ) The best I ever had, seriously. I'm that one person that always order lamb and I can honestly say this was the place. My medium rare lamb was cooked perfectly.. not to rare either just perfect and ever bite had this explosion in my mouth. So mouth watering good, it also came with a blue corn tamale! How can a tamale be so soft and moist? Ugh, I want to go back and order this again.   Boyfriend had the ( New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin, cooked medium ) So good, I took a bite of it and the pork was moist and juicy. I didn't know you could get pork medium I guess it's just the part of pork you're eating you can. It also came with a sweet potato tamale, sounds weird together but very good. Make sure to take a bite of the pork with the tamale together... oh you won't regret it hahaha.   Dessert -  ( Chocolate cajeta cake ) - Wow, moist! Seriously every dish is so moist hahaha. Best cake ever, try it guys. It's warm chocolate cake with ice cream, who doesn't like that?   Overall everything was super delicious, service was good but not top notch. Everything was really filling, I honestly thought the dishes were way bigger, but the photos in yelp are all lies hahaha it's actually really small but when you continue to eat you'll actually get really full but  even though you're full you can't say no to dessert hahaha.   2 Entrees - 1 Dessert = $108 and some change, which is a really good price for our meal.",

    "text": "Well it took a while, but I finally made time to stop by Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill.  I'm not that big a Flay fan, but I was really interested in trying his food based on the pics I've seen on yelp which look pretty damn creative.  I stopped over for lunch and based on early recommendations from my friends and my own curiosity, I didn't waste any time with ordering.  I started with the Blue Corn Pancake for my appetizer and their Chile Relleno for my entree.  Blue Corn Pancake with Barbecued Duck - with habanero chili and star anise sauce.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FY2YRp1&s=9fce82b865d911cb0e4be15b2d9455226f0d9c3f546147fa33f3c5c0c7e647ee\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/Y2YRp1</a> This was pretty much like a duck taco.  The duck was very tasty and had a nice smokey flavor with a little kick to it.  It was really good and I'd order this again.  The only hiccup I had with this was the fact that I ended up chewing on a bone near the end.  That was a red flag and I told my waiter about it.  He was shocked!  The real sucky part about it was that I didn't get any compensation for it.  Cornmeal Crusted Chile Relleno -  with Roasted Eggplant,  Manchego Cheese  Sweet Red Pepper Sauce, and Balsamic Vinegar <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FVmHanC&s=b640723c50fa47b6139328dda0e73ca56e86bf25f697d60861f6336eb576ca91\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/VmHanC</a> I've had my fair share of Chile Rellenos, but this has got to be the most fanciest Chile Relleno I've ever seen.  And it was good as expected!  The Chile crust had a nice crunch to it while the cheese was nicely melted down.  And to exhibit a little bit of food porn, check out the gooey cheese oozing out from inside.  (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FWYhacm&s=e9dfd05cc12f8d56fc7461d97b996fc5b0c5b78587c3ab5053888dafcbe66b57\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/WYhacm</a>)  Ooooooh yes!!!    For the most part, other than that hiccup with the bone in the duck pancake, service was still good.  My waiter was very courteous and always checked on me over the course of my meal.  It would've been nice to have a little compensation or bill removal for the bone which I probably should've requested, but I'm not that aggressive.  I'd probably consider going back again to Mesa Grill to try their other menu items, but it probably won't be for a while.  The food is good, but I'd really have to be in mood for it to go back.  3.5 stars rounded up to 4!",

    "text": "Ok, we admit it... we have a ridiculous foodie crush on Chef Bobby Flay!  We have been to almost every restaurant he has, including completing the Trifecta of Mesa Grills... New York, VEGAS (at Caesar's Palace across from Pure) and the Bahamas (at the Cove, at the Atlantis in Paradise Island).  Mesa offers lunch and dinner, as well as brunch on Saturdays and Sundays. The food is spicy, inventive and ExCeLLeNT!  For dinner, start off with the Shrimp and Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale, the Blue Corn Pancake with BBQ Duck and the Sophie's Chopped Salad (with chick peas, olives and tortillas).  Famous for southwestern cuisine and grilling, be ready for some spicy meat!  The New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin with a Sweet Potato Tamale and Crushed Pecan Butter.... damn! The Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops with Red Chile, Lime and Rosemary, with Green Corn Pudding.... whew... sexy!  Blue Corn Soft Shell Crabs with Bacon, Green Onion and Chile Vinegar... I could go on and on.  If you can make it for brunch... please do!  I think it may be better than dinner.  First off, a ridiculously amazing bread basket- my favorite is the spicy, corn muffins with pieces of corn in it and swirls of spice.  For your entree, definitely have the Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash with Poached Eggs and Green Chile Hollandaise.  I can not even explain how good this is.  Sort of like a spicy Eggs Benedict with chicken and sweet potato homefries.  Some one always orders the Eggs and Aged Sirloin Tortilla with Roasted Peppers and Avocado Relish... and loves it!  It is simple, but delish... think make your own tacos with steak and eggs.  No matter what meal you eat, the tequila cocktails are the perfect accompaniment.    Hands down, the Cactus Pear Margarita wins it!  Watch out boys... its pink!  The Scene- Always full... full of Foodies!  Lively!    Food and Drinks- 5: Mind Blowing and Life Changing.    Tip Worthy- 5: The New Yorker 25-30%.  Excellent service... 3 to 4 servers at a time... one water, one bread, busy boy and waiter... without being the LEAST BIT stuffy.  Coordinates- 4: Neighborhood- Centrally located!   Restaurant Return Rate- Green light!  Between the three Mesa's, we have had at least 10 meals.  We bring everyone we know when there is one close by.    This review written by Angela.",

They were spicy and stale.  The reason I bring up spicy there is a trend starting.  I ordered the grilled asparagus salad.  I love everything in the salad.   The grilled asparagus, the baby lettuce, the small yellow tomatoes.  Then the dressing burned my lips off.  The dressing was so hot I couldn't taste any of the ingredients.  I am Korean my mom has made soup so hot it could remove rust.  That soup is nothing compared to this.  Next I ordered the fillet.  The filet was cooked absolutely a perfect medium rare.  The only problem I had to cut off the entire outside of my steak because the rub was too spicy.  I am an invited guest at Caesars so I could eat at any restaurant.  I was extremely disappointed in my meal.",

My husband took the shrimp taco special, and I took a grilled chicken salad. We split the plates, so we could have a little of both.   I had a peach margarita - AWESOME, and my husband had the \"Perfect Margarita\" - also AWESOME.   My salad was so salty. It was lightly dressed with a vinaigrette, but it was sprinkled with sea salt, so when I took a bite, I got salty, crunchy bits - not good. The chicken for the salad was over seasoned, as was the shrimp. The sauces that came with the shrimp were excellent.   I'm bummed because I expected a better meal. Luckily the good drinks helped the saltiness go down. But, I won't be eating here again.",

I am not one to order pork, but the waiter assured me they would be delicious--and they were.  My husband had the veal chop and it was also flavorful and yummy.  For starter were shared the shrimp tamale--which was to die for.  Should have ordered two--so very good.  Each entree came with a tamale with pecans, and it was unbelievably good.  I was so impressed we returned for brunch.  I was not so impressed, and was actually disappointed with my dish.  I had scrambled egg chilaquiles.  I did not like the flavor of the sauces at all, and had really expected something great.  Would not recommend at all.  They were more like deconstructed chilaquiles.  My husband, on the other hand, ordered two appetizers.  He had the shrimp tamale--which was every bit as good as before, and the bacon and egg quesadilla, which again was superb.     Service was goo, and the bread baskets on both trips were very good.  I would go back again, but certainly would skip the chilaquiles.",

Thought it might have been the heavy pepper seasoning so I cut the edges off, no luck still grit. Not something I would expect from such a restaurant. The rest of the salad was scrumptious. My friend had the green chili burger and fries. Burger was cooked well but a little boring, no sauce whatsoever on the burger or accompanying fries. The server noticed I didn't eat and did his best to rectify the situation which I appreciated. Also service was quick and friendly. So decent place but I prob won't be back.",

Two of the party showed up 15 minutes early and were told that we could not be seated until the rest of the party arrived. At 9:50PM our party was complete but the hostess would not seat us. We went up to find out why and the hostess was seating walk ins. We asked to be seated at an open table and eventuality at 10:05 we were seated without menus. At 10:15 I asked the hostess for menus and was told that they sat us to shut us up and that security was going to remove us from the restaurant. Security showed up and laughed when asked to have us removed. We eventually got our menus at 10:30PM and was served after people that were sat after us. Service was horrible and I believe because two of our party were gay we were discriminated against. It would make it much easier to avoid these kind of restaurants if they would make that claim before we made a reservation.",

I didn't, however, & since I was hungry, I tried to eat as much of it as I could.  I ordered creamed spinach as my side dish, which was good, & that helped to make the salmon taste better.

    "text": "Been here a few times now, here's a complete rewrite...  We've been here for food a few times and just drinks several more times. The service has been amazing and poor. The food is good to great, the margaritas are excellent.  First the drinks, they really know margaritas. I don't think their \"Mesa Margarita\" is good but not great. It's a good start that runs slightly sweet without being the typical \"punch-style\" margarita. With the Especial Margarita, you call the tequila and pick one of three orange liqueurs. If you've got a favorite tequila in mind you want this.  Finally, they have the Partida. It's served straight up in a martini glass. But you can get it in a bucket if you prefer. Because there's no ice, it's going to look small. Don't slam this drink. Enjoy it!  Some people think it's too sour, I think it's an amazing drink.   On our first visit a few years ago, lunch was average. The food was good but the various odd plate shapes actually made eating a bit awkward, maybe we were just tired after the flight. Recently, four of us had dinner and it was probably one of the best service experiences any of us has  ever had in a restaurant. At the start, the wine sommelier switched gears into a beer and tequila expert without missing a beat. I'm pretty sure this isn't his job, but he stepped up and took our entire drink order. We were being pretty picky about what we wanted (me about the margaritas and another guy about beer and tequila combinations), he accommodated everything, offered great alternatives when they didn't stock what we asked for and never made us feel like we were too demanding (we probably were). Our whole party clicked with the waitress. She played along well with our \"we're going to be here a while, drink and eat a bunch, we might be a pain in the ass, and we'll tip well for it\" vibe. Seriously the best service I can remember in a restaurant. For food, two of us has the chile relleno (it's really stuffed eggplant), my wife thought her chicken was good, but my pork tenderloin was the winner at the table. I'll order that again and again.  About the poor service... On a different night, we went for appetizers after 10pm. Our waitress seemed uninterested and annoyed from the time she walked up. During our stay, we saw her engaging with other tables for long periods of time, but she never checked on us. Maybe we did something early to set her off, maybe four appetizers plus drinks didn't impress her. The busboy made up for it though, we nominated him as our server and just decided to ask him for everything we wanted, tipping him in cash when we left. We did leave a small tip for the waitress, the food was fine, nothing went wrong, but it was pretty clear she didn't want to deal with us.",

R. and i sat at the bar for dinner and enjoyed every minute. i had the black bean soup with cumin crema and three relishes, and really, i would bathe in that soup it's so good! i had my face in the bowl and was licking it clean when R.R. gently reminded me that we were in public and ladies generally try not to eat like wildebeests. my bad. sophie's chopped salad was good, but nothing special. R.R. made some good choices as well - be sure check out the rough-cut tuna \"nachos\" and the shrimp and corn tamale. and the bartenders were awesome; one mixed us a free taste of his special \"red bull mojito\" - yummy!   so while i'm glad to have checked out mesa grill because the food was incredible, i only wish that my hard-earned money were going to someone other than douchebag flay.",

Sadly, Bobby was not there, and to my chagrin our server said we just missed him; he was there the week before. Ah well.   The restaurant is bright and elegantly decorated, colorful, and all the waitstaff were very professional and friendly. They have several lounge \"cubicles\" to wait while your table is being setup too, which I thought was pretty smart for groups that are waiting - you can still talk and everyone can sit and face each other while you wait.   We ate: 3 course meal of:  1) Blue corn pancake: bbq duck + habanero chile + star anise sauce - Pretty good, but a little on the salty side 2) New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich: pretty good, light and fresh, came with Mexican spiced fries too that were really good. This is what everyone calls the #1 dish here, but I really think that award goes to the corn tamale (below).  3) Panna Cotta: SO GOOD - nice and light and the fruit was soaked in some type of liquor and really fresh and ripe.   Others: Appetizers:  Cremini Mushroom Quesadilla: pretty good, but will try something else next time Tiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale: OMG I could eat this all day, every day, for the rest of my life. The shrimp was nicely seasoned and tender, not overcooked, the tamale was sweet and savory, the white corn was fresh and drowned in this yummy creamy corn sauce. YUM....  Friend got the Chile Rellenos, which was also quite good. Melt in your mouth cheesy-ness. Mmm  Get the corn tamale!!",

The sweet chile sauce was a bit too sweet and overpowered whatever flavor the duck had been seasoned with. Entrees were Pork Tenderloin and Filet Mignon. Pork was seasoned well but the sweet sauce was a overpowering all the other nice flavors. Filet mignon was perfect and the coffee rub was very good. Brussel sprout side dish was amazing, and no sweet sauce anywhere. Banana cream pie dessert was very good with the banana cream unlike any other. Overall, the sweet sauces could be tempered to allow other flavors to shine. Service was excellent so 4 stars with the only setback being the sweet sauces for the tenderloin and duck.",

Not because the menu was chalk full of creative well prepared dishes that you would come to expect from an iron chef, because it wasn't.  It just wasn't.  Wasn't worth the visit, the drinks were weak, and the food was ordinary.  This ruined one of my sinful delights, watching \"Throw Down\".    How can I watch Bobby knowing his restaurants don't live up to the hype.   How can I watch knowing he would never skimp on alcohol on his shows, but his restaurants are serving up some weak cactus margaritas. The prices are high and the value is low.  There are many other good places to eat in Vegas, unfortunately,  Mesa Grill isn't one of them  Sorry Bobby, perhaps you should do a Throw down here, you might actually this one.",

    "text": "So, a group of 6 girls went to dinner for my best friend's kick off dinner for her bachelorette weekend. We originally wanted to go to the buffet at Bellagio but when we got there, it was about 10:30 PM and most of the restaurants in Vegas were closing (restaurants in Vegas actually close! That didn't dawn on us...). Since we were staying at Caesars, we thought of the restaurants in the hotel and thought of Mr. Flay. I called and they said if we hurried over, we may still be able to be seated. So we hustled over from the Bellagio and were seated. YAY!   We were all starving after all flying into Vegas and having such a late dinner. We munched on the free bread which was nothing spectacular. After reading over the menu, we made our selections: one ordered the pork tenderloin, another ordered the salmon, two ordered the chicken, and one ordered the cioppino. I had a NY strip because nothing really jumped out at me.  It was cooked to a perfect rare and it tasted fine but nothing very special or fancy about it.   We split the following sides: +Corn: good but very, very creamy. It might be a little rich for some people +Mashed potatoes: good and creamy. +Tamale: horrible. It was sweet and tangy, really funky tasting. It wasn't just me.. everyone at the table agreed.   At the end of dinner, everyone was not impressed with their dishes. In fact, we all were disappointed and joked about being better off going to the 24 hr cafe. I was so excited to finally try his restaurant after hearing so many good things and watching him on Food Network for all these years. But, epic failure.  I would not go there again, or try Bobby Flay's cooking again either.",

Once you get over that, it's a great restaurant, however overpriced, tried their jumbo shrimp appetizer, blue corn cakes with duck, and coffee rubbed steak.  The steak, at $44 was a bit much for what it was (considering it doesn't come with sides).  If you want a side that's another $8.  For $50+ for the main meal, it wasn't outstanding.  But the appetizers, at $15 a piece, were much better prepared and more bang for the buck.",

Spicy Chicken + Sweet Potato Hash (w/ poached egg): I got this because it looked interesting, but not exactly sure how the flavors would compliment each other. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't \"love\". The egg didn't do a lot for me on this dish. If the combination above sounds like it will go great to you, then you'll probably love this dish.

I dragged my husband away from our excellent accomodations at Encore to go to Ceasars just for Mesa Grill...the result...huge disappointment:(   I agree with another Yelper when she said \"The wait, service, meal, the whole experience all fell short of expectations.\"   The host greeted us by staring at a computer screen, no eye contact, or smile on his face. The servers and bus boys don't get out of your way as you're walking to your table or to the restroom...instead they prioritize their walk, almost bumping into me a few times!  I was so extremely bummed to find that the restaurant only offers a brunch menu on Sunday at 1:30pm, as we were expecting the full choices for lunch. They advertise the lunch menu outside, and it's not until you're already seated that you find brunch is your only option. There were hardly any choices at all!  We ordered 2 appetizers, and for entrees the burger and the spice chicken salad. All the food was bland. I've honestly had better burgers at the Burger Lounge chain in LA, or dare I say even at an Applebees or Chilis restaurant. Seriously! WTF?!  Bland, bland, bland.  There wasn't 1 thing I would care to taste again.   My advice: spend your $75 for a lunch for 2 elsewhere.  Bobby...you have broken my heart! :( Please redeem yourself with some changes to your restaurant. I know you can do so much better.",

    "text": "Buen provecho!   SUMMARY: The food here was very tasty. Theirs is a modern, elegant take on Southwestern fare. There was a splash of sweet and a kick of spice in each dish. The meat was tender and the service was excellent. Our server, Joel, was attentive and informative.  He made a lovely meal all the more enjoyable.   EXPECTATION OF THE FAMOUS:  Emily Dickenson lamented, \"How dreary - to be - Somebody!\" I don't know how \"dreary\" fame is nowadays, but there are drawbacks.  Clearly Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill both suffers and benefits from his fame. My advice? Let go of whatever you think of Bobby Flay when you sit down to eat. Don't allow preconceived notions fed by reality television shows to color your expectation.  Many fabulous restaurants on the strip are owned/led by accomplished, talented, and (when we are lucky) creative chefs. At Mesa Grill (MG) the owner/executive chef also happens to be famous.  That fact should be the least important part of your experience with this place.  THE FOOD  TIGER SHRIMP: This delectable bite was my favorite of the night. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and like many dishes at Mesa Grill, comes with corn.  This appetizer was creamy and sweet. It was a gentle start to the meal.  BLUE CORN PANCAKE: Served with barbequed duck, this dish was a tad sweet for my taste. But the tender meat and complex sauce compensated for the overly sweet bite.  NEW MEXICAN SPICE RUBBED PORK TENDERLOIN and GRILLED LAMB PORTERHOUSE CHOPS: Both dishes packed a (now familiar) sweet and spicy punch. By the time the grilled lamb came out, I was a bit tired of the sweet dishes. But in fairness the \"sweet + meat\" combo works. For spice reluctant palates, the sweet provides a gentle method for accepting the kick in many of the dishes.  There is a purpose behind the flavor selections. I appreciate the thoughtfulness behind the dishes.  What more could I ask?  CHURROS: Warm, sweet, and light.  PRICKLY PEAR MARGHARITA: Sweet and expected.  VERDICT: This was a lovely meal. The food was well prepared and the overall experience was enjoyable. While I'm not putting Mesa Grill on my rotation, I would certainly visit with a friend from out of town. There is a slight.... artificiality to the place that I can't pin down. It's a slick establishment.  They are looking to leave you feeling something. I may not have been as moved as MG management would have liked, but I appreciate the professionalism and the effort.   There is nothing \"dreary\" about doing something well. And Mesa Grill does high-end, delicious Southwestern food very well.",

We had the tenderloin, it was tender and spicey, which was nice.  We also had the ribeye, which had a nice char and bite on the outside crust.   Didn't expect any less from this place.  Only regret is that, I wish we had ventured to try the Rabbit or the Veal Chops.  Oh well, maybe next time.  The cherry on top eating here this time was that we used vouchers to pay for our meal so it was free.  At that price point the meal always taste just a little better.   =)  Oh, we also had the beach margarita, and for two non lushes, this was the perfect complimentary beverage with our meal.     Tip: Sit in the back in the boths and do some people watching while you're there and engage those around you.  It's probably their first time there too and I'm sure they're more that willing to share about their meal or the reason why they're in Vegas.  Engage one another people, not everyone bites.. like i said.. not everyone.. Cheers!!",

My cactus pear margarita was the perfect balance of sweet and booze.  Apparently, their pisco is amazing too.  For an appetizer, we went with goat cheese queso fundido. I love cheese so this was fantastic & the goat cheese gave it an extra kick.  I ordered tuna for my entree. It was alright. The thing to get here is definitely the spice rubbed pork tenderloin. Holy deliciousness! It's spicy so beware. The tamale that came with the pork was cold. Boo. Our server was great!  I was satisfied overall (i'm usually satisfied after stuffing my face) but I don't know if I'd come back. Probably only if someone else REALLY wanted to go.",

Throughout dinner the wait staff were super - very attentive, prompt with our order, and helpful. Service is very important and the waiters can make or break a Restuarant - in our case they totally made our night enjoyable.   Now moving to our meals. We ordered 2 shrimp tamales which were exquisite and I am a huge tamale fan so I know a good tamale when I taste it!!! I would definitely recommend the tamales. We also ordered as our main dishes - a tuna steak, the ancho salmon, and the spice rubbed pork tenderloin. Each dish was prepared to perfection. I had the pork tenderloin and I would go back to Mesa Grill to have this again any day. It's easy to see why Bobby Flay is a celebrity chef and although he did not prepare the meal personally he has great chefs preparing meals for his guests.  I know that some folks complain about the small portion sizes at a place like Mesa Grill, but all I have to say is, if you want a lot of food go to a place that has a buffet that's why they exist; however, I'll continue to go to Mesa Grill for a great meal experience.",

Service was amazing and the atmosphere was modern and beautiful. Everything complimented each other perfectly. For an appetizer we ordered the rough cut tuna nachos. It looked gorgeous and the fish, sauces and oils were perfectly spicy and balanced! I could be happy just eating that itself. Then for my entree I ordered the coffee crusted filet mignon medium rare. Hands down amazing I can't even describe it. It's the best cut of meat I've ever had. Ever! I also ordered a side of mashed potatoes centered with creamy poblano cheese. I ate everything! My husband got the unshelled lobster with corn cakes. Absolutely tasty and father in law had the lamb chops with a tamale. Prices are expensive but totally worth it. You're in Vegas. Live a little. You'll be happy you went here.",

The bread basket was good and came with blue corn and bell pepper muffins.  I ordered the corn soup to start and the smoked chicken and black bean quesadilla.  The corn soup was excellent and had a spicy kick from the chipotle cream.  Quesadillas seem so pedestrian, but I was dying to try a Bobby Flay quesadilla.  Frankly, this was a bit disappointing because the tortilla seemed overcooked and slightly burnt.  The smoked chicken component was good, but I couldn't find much black bean.  Overall, this dish was underwhelming.  I also sampled my friend's veal, which was excellent.  The lobster tacos were very good but also very small.  I'd recommend Mesa Grill if you like dolled up Southwestern fare - just skip the quesadilla.",

Usually wouldn't make a difference but the table next to us were a group of four loud drunk couples, a bit of cougar action going on there which made it even weirder.

    "text": "With food so delicious and inventive you know it could have only come from the mind of an Iron Chief.    I had heard rave reviews about Iron Chief Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill. I asked quite a few people what style of food is served at Mesa and I got a wide variety of answers. Some said American, some said Mexican, but quite a few said Tex-Mex. Since I was kind of confused of what Tex-Mex food was I decided to take a trip down to Caesar's Palace with my girlfriend and give this place a try.  The restaurant has an amazing atmosphere. I love the decor of this place. Mr. Flay sure has great taste. Once seated we decided to try some appetizers. I ordered the Blue Corn Pancake (barbecued duck with habanero chile-star anise sauce) and my GF got the Goat Cheese Queso Fundido with chips. The Blue Corn Pancake was phenomenal. The sauce on the pancake was great and the bbq duck was nice and tender. The dip my GF got was also very good.  For dinner I ordered the 22 oz bone in chipotle glazed rib-eye with red and green chile sauce and a chorizo goat cheese tamale with thyme butter. This dinner was absolutely perfect. The steak was cooked to perfection and the sauces that accompanied the meat really made this meal an unforgettable one. The chorizo tamale was incredible. My girlfriend got the sixteen spice crusted chicken with mango garlic sauce and mango salsa. The chicken had an exotic taste to it, which my GF enjoyed. For Dessert we shared the cornflake crunch vanilla ice cream with the Mexican chocolate sauce. This dessert was tasty and really hit the spot after such a great meal.  The service was 5 stars all the way. Our waitress was funny and very informative.  Mesa Grill is a bit on the expensive side but the food and services you receive make it well worth the money. I loved my dining experience at Mesa Grill. I have been back to Mesa a few times since this first trip and each visit has been as wonderful as this first one. Do your self a favor and check out Mesa Grill, you will defiantly not regret it.",

    "text": "Birthday weekend for an adorable Indonesian girl started here.  Was actually looking forward to this dinner the whole week.  No doubt the food will be full of southwestern flavor.  Dinner started with a bottle of Chimay blue and some duck pancakes.  The pancakes were succulent to say the least.  Very flavorful like tender BBQ pork chunks wrapped in a small thin pancake.  Not sure what it's made of but I'm sure it had blue corn in it.  It is Bobby Flay we're talking about.  The main dish was rib eye steak.  I ordered medium rare but the waitress suggested medium due to the rarity near the bone.  Seems some people don't like it that rare.    Turns out the inside near the bone was pretty good.  Tender and a small amount of pink.  The only issue was the ends of the rib eye was burnt and cooked all the way through.  Oh well next time I stick with what I know.   The steak was generally minimalist which I like.  Not too much sauce just salt and pepper.  The steak was quite large, enough to share a small piece with 4 others.   The favors were returned and I got to taste the pork tenderloin.  Now that is a great dish.  Three tender cylinders about one and a half inches in diameter and two inches tall.  How they cook the meat through and keep it so tender with the tasty crust not burned is impressive.  We all shared the toffee pudding which as tasty.  All in all the dinner was just fun.  The venue is just ultra nice and modern and the atmosphere frou frou.  Of course I had to take a couple of pictures of me knawing on the bone.  This is obviously after two Chimays so I take no responsibility for driving our dinner neighbors away.  LOL.  I expected to pay a bit for such ambience and great service but I would not do this on the regular.",

(eye roll) But we went ahead and ordered, I was set for Filet Mignon but we had 2 pm reservations so they were only doing brunch :(. (But that's our fault for not informing ourselves) I believe brunch ends at 3, restaurant closes for about an hour and reopens again at 5 for dinner.   But the portions where just fine (I don't know what people are talking about) , I ordered the New Mexican spiced pork tenderloin sandwich and my bf the Spicy Scrambled Eggs. They where so good we couldn't finish them, tasted even better later on at night when I got hungry again. The eggs where so fluffy, like puree, the theme is Mexican inspired and definitely tasted the ingredients in there ( I am Mexican) it reminded me of my mom potato egg salad.   Will definitely be coming back next time with late reservations and getting the Filet Mignon.",

We started off with the blue corn pancake with the duck.  I thought this dish was delicious!  I could go for a little less sauce on the duck but other than that, it was really good!  We also got the tuna and salmon tartare.  Also very good!  I liked it a lot because it was a bit spicy.  For the entree, my boyfriend and I shared the veal with the wild rice tamale.  I don't like tamales, but I must say this was pretty good.  My boyfriend LOVED the tamale!  The veal was cooked perfectly! Omg, it was sooo good that we finished every last bite!  We also got a side of the double baked potato!  Also a great side!  The best side though was the roasted corn!  It was absolutely delicious!!!    The chicken quesadilla was ok.  This was the only one I was a bit disappointed in.  Other than that, everything here was good.  Nothing that Truely wowed me, except maybe their roasted corn. I know! Weird, but omg, so good!",

    "text": "This is review #476 for this place???  Holy cow....what more can I say that hasn't already been said.  After a day at the Convention Center, a group of us headed over to watch Monday Night Football at Caeser's Palace.  Thankfully, one of us thought ahead and got reservations at Mesa Grill.  Our previous plan of Nobu would have to wait.  The game was entertaining as hell and we headed over to Bobby Flay's place.  I love a wide open room like they have here.  Much better Vegas ambiance than tiny little rooms.  Very simple decor with the tequila bar and open kitchen dominating the view.  The Yelp reviews gave me a great preview of what to order and my dining partners appreciated the hints I was able to provide.  It took a long time to get a drink order.  When I mentioned a margarita, I had to wait to get the special margarita menu.  How many ways can you make a margarita?  Apparently about 190.  The menu was ridiculous.  Far too many choices.  Geez, it's just tequila.  I took the waiter's recommendation and was not disappointed.  It was not cheap, maybe $15, by the time the extra options were added up.  It was delicious.    Appetizers were next.  The Queso Fundido (Blue corn chips and a hot cheeze dip) was wonderful.  Cheesy and spicy.  Tiger shrimp and roasted garlic corn tamales were just amazing.  Kind of small portions but the tastes were unique and complementary.  We also had the blue corn crusted squid.  Lightly crunchy with a tangy sauce.  I had the blue corn crusted halibut.  Off the chart fantastic.  I love a simple piece of grilled meat or fish with a plain starch and veggie.  Here, you are subjected to a wild array of seasonings, toppings, garnishes, etc.  They hit the spot....big time.  A meaty fish that held up to the accompaniments.  Absolutely delicious.    My dining partners had the pork tenderloin, duck breast and the rib eye steak.  Four dudes sitting around the table offering each other bites.  So very uncool, so very yummy.  Sides of spinach and corn rounded out the main dishes.  We split the toasted coconut layer cake.  Very tasty, indeed.    I'm not a huge Bobby Flay, TV star, fan.  I am a giant Bobby Flay, fill my gut with tasty food, fan.  Highly recommended.",

    "text": "While I was sitting outside La Salsa waiting for Mr. WTF to get back with the show tickets, I browsed Yelp on my phone, and discovered that I didn't need to settle for mediocre chain mexican food, I could go next door to Caesar's and try Mesa. Bobby Flay, eh, names don't impress me, but good food and good reviews do.  We went in without reservations just before 5pm. The place was pretty empty, yet the hostess said it would be a 25 minute wait. We couldn't wait - had to eat and get over to TI for the Cirque show. So we opted to eat at the bar.  Hubby had the Mango + Spice crusted Tuna steak. I tried a bite - it was okay, but couldn't hold a candle to my meal. I got the Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin. Gotta give this dish 5 stars - this was probably the best pork I've had in my life. It was spicy but not over the top, full of flavor, juicy, and the sweet tamale it was served with was a perfect companion to offset the heat. I think they should rename it Perfection on a Plate. Or Porkfection...no, wait, that doesn't sound so good. Anyway, if you go here, ORDER THE PORK.  We did not receive a bread basket full of goodies, so I'm knocking off a star. The bartender was super nice and she made a killer Lemon Drop. It was pretty pricy for what you get, so I'm not sure we'll go back. There are so many restaurants in Vegas to choose from, and I haven't even scratched the surface. But the pork tenderloin will remain a good memory.",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try Mesa Grill forever especially after having a great experience at Bar Americain in New York. So my husband and I and two friends decided to try brunch at Mesa Grill. The restaurant, though small, was very hip and I loved the decor and the bright colors.  My husband ordered the sweet potato hash with poach eggs and green chili hollendaise, I ordered the chiliquiles, home fries and also a peach bellini. We were surprised when a bread basket was brought to our table with a variety of breads. One appeared to be a coffee cake, one a blue corn cornbread, one a jalapeno biscuit, and I can't remember what the other was. All were good except the blue corn cornbread which was a little dry. The peach bellini was good but it was very small. I kept eying my friends margarita thinking that I should have gotten that since it was the same price and significantly bigger. The sweet potato hash with poached eggs was amazing and I was sad that I didn't order it. The chiliquiles that I ordered were ok, but could have used more egg. Our friends ordered a burger and the breakfast enchilada's. While the burger looked pretty good and was fairly big, the enchilada's looked really dry and there was very little food on the plate.  I decided to try the chocolate corn bread pudding for the sake of trying something a little different. It was ok but I was expecting it to be more like an actual bread pudding. The texture was a bit strange and in my opinion, it tasted like a chocolate cake that had not been baked long enough.  All in all, I would say our experience was simply ok. I am glad we went there for brunch which is when the meals are the cheapest but didn't feel that most of the food was worth it for what you paid. On the other hand, the service was actually great and I would still consider going back just to order the sweet potato hash with poached eggs.",

    "text": "I think it was because the fight was going on and a very odd woman was laying down and going a bit nutty that made me give this place 4 stars. Mesa Grill is located near the Pure and the Sports book in Caesars Palace. The Pacquiao vs Margarito fight was that night, so getting to Mesa was a little difficult. We had a 7:45 reservation and if you miss your reservation you are charged a 50 dollar per person cancellation fee. I did not want to take that risk. We checked in for our reservations and were asked to wait near the bar. Dan and I ordered some semi custom margaritas. The margaritas were awesome.. I mean tasty and strong. I opted to get the basic margarita and add a shot of grand mariner to give it a little citrus kick. Dan went with the Margarita with Patron. We got our drinks and before we took our first sip, our table was ready. Our server was friendly but he looked a little preoccupied. Like I said earlier.. there was this woman dining alone who was acting peculiar. The EMT was called, but she was nutty not sick. She kept on moving back and forth between seats and laying down, this made a uncomfortable dinner. I think this took away from the Mesa experience because the server and staff were focused on this lady. Also since it is near the sports book, you can hear every cheer, jeer, and swear coming from the sports book.   The reason we made our reservation is because we love Bobby Flay and his chefs did not disappoint. We started ROUGH CUT TUNA \"NACHOS\" and it was tasty. the Mango - Habanero Hot Sauce and Avocado Crema complemented the tuna. It was a sweet and tangy starter. For dinner, I went with the NEW MEXICAN SPICE RUBBED PORK TENDERLOIN and I swear I saw food god that day. It was prepared to perfection and the Bourbon - Ancho Chile Sauce was so sweet yet spicy. I wasn't a fan of the tamale but the meat made up for it. Dan got a steak and I cannot comment on it because I was loving my pork. I think I only gave him a small bite because I didn't want to share and I cannot remember the flavors. We did order another round of margaritas and did not get any dessert because we needed to get to Mirage to see Jo Koy. At the end of our dinner, our server did give us plastic cups to take with us so that was a nice extra that we would have forgotten. I feel if it was a different day I would be giving this place 5 starts but the service and the proximity of the sports book made me take it down to 4.",

We got there, and while we had reservations and they seated us right away, the hostess was very aloof and a little crabby.  Our waiter took a very long time to get to us (over 10 minutes), and when we ordrered drinks, it took another 15 minutes to get them (even water). There are VERY few wines that you may order by the glass, and if you are not a big drinker, and only want one glass, its virtually impossible.  It is a little loud, but since it's in a casino, I wasn't too upset with that fact.  We wanted to try all the food we could, so we ordered 3 appetizers which are small, so thats a good thing.  The squash blossoms, and prawn tamale were quite good, and the small chicken tacos were ok.  We ordered a New York strip to share, and while it was cooked correctly, it had very little taste.  The side was a black bean stuffed chile rellano that had no taste at all.  I love spicy food, and was expecting a lot more spice (not nessacarially hot spice, but some taste).   I took a minute to really look around, and it seemed that all the waiters looked as if they were incredibly bored and did not smile at all, or barely even look at the other diners.  I was exteremely disappointed in the entire experience, from the staff to the food, to the atmosphere.  I love to try new places and am a food lover, so this restaurant was a great disappointment.  I will not recommend Mesa Grill to anyone.",

I'm not a fan of Bobby Flay, nor do I believe in defiling quality meats with spicy rubs and marinades but Mesa Grill does it right.  I shared 2 appetizers and 2 entrees with 3 girls - we had the duck stuffed blue corn pancake (so good!) and the rough cut tuna nachos (eh).   The pork tenderloin was our favorite dish.  It was super tender and the spicy rub and habanero sauce gave it an awesome kick.  The tamale that came with the pork was sweet and very different compared to tamales I've typically had in the past.  The coffee rubbed filet mignon was HUGE - 10oz and so so so tender.  Both meats were very flavorful and prepared well.  For dessert, we got the multi-layered coconut cake - we destroyed that in less than 2 minutes. delicious!",

However, my Mesa Burger just didn't have that awesome grilling taste that one would expect.  A properly grilled burger should have been more charred from the high heat of the flame.  My burger tasted like any typical burger from an ordinary restaurant.  Nothing really stood out.  Also, the service here was not good.  We had to repeatedly ask for the same request over and over again.  It really wasn't that busy, so I don't understand why the waiter couldn't get the request right from the first time.  The bread basket was good here though.  It had that heat that one expect from a Southwestern cuisine.  ETA - We went there during the weekend lunch (brunch), so they didn't have the classic entree like the Rib Eye.  Maybe the dinner menu would have tasted better, but since we couldn't make it for dinner we had to settle for what was on the lunch menu.  Nevertheless, they have the proper equipment and the knowledgeable technique so the burger should have tasted better.  Overall, I love Caesars Palace and respect Bobby Flay, I just didn't love Mesa Grill.  It was just an average type of place.",

    "text": "Bobby Flay, you did me good.   I was excited to try mesa grill and hoping to get a glimpse of bobby flay. I went with my bf, friend and her bf on a Sunday for brunch. We walked in and were quickly greeted by two hostess with bright colored shirts and black suits on. The place was very colorful with one wall with a rainbow of agua de fresca jugs. We sat in the middle area, where the boys could still see the games going on on the other side of the glass wall in the sports bet area. Our waiter was nice yet cocky like bobby flay, which almost rubbed me the wrong way. After a heavy night of drinking, I wasn't in the mood for any more alcohol, even though the bellini sounded good! I ordered the cactus pear ice tea ($4). The ice tea had a southern tea feel, slightly flowery. I believe it comes with some simple syrup that you could put in it, but I think it tastes better without it.   Bf: do you have any regular ice tea?  waiter: NO  =(   We were brought a basket of 4 different kinds of bread. Jalapeno muffin, regular corn bread, jalapeno scone and coffee cake. The jalapeno muffin was a perfectly buttery, light, and flakey and had tiny bright green flakes of jalapenos so it had a kick of heat, but not too hot where it burned your mouth. The regular corn bread had specks of red and green chile flakes, and perfectly baked where it was still moist. The scone had a hint of sweet taste with some dried raisins and cranberries. The coffee cake wasn't too sweet, where you really needed to drink it with coffee.   as per suggestion by the waiter, we ordered the appetizer Crispy Bacon + Hash Brown Quesadilla with fried egg and spicy tomato salsa. this was so good. the tortilla tasted homemade, where it was light and fluffy and not chewy. the bacon gave it the saltyness and the hashbrown a slight crisp. all together with the fried egg and salsa on top... yum   the waiter suggested the Ancho Chile-Honey Glazed Salmon with Spicy Black Bean Sauce and Roasted Jalapeno Crema as the perfect dish to display bobby flays style of balancing sweet and savory so i wanted to get it. i was instructed to make sure to eat the salmon with the white sauce. the salmon was perfectly cooked where it was flaky and just fell apart while still being moist. the sauces were so bright and the colors were vibrant. it had a nice fresh salsa on top. all together it was nice. i had expected a bit more of fire in bobby flays dish, but it was just enough that you could appreciate all the flavors.   Spicy Scrambled Eggs (Green Onion, Jalapeno, Goat Cheese) Apricot-Mustard Glazed Ham+ Buttermilk Biscuits. wow! you'd think \"what, its just scrambled eggs\" but the scrambled eggs were delicious! i swear i love goat cheese. it was creamy and salty and hearty. the ham was sweet and salty and makes your mouth water. the biscuits were a bit spicy like it had a bunch of black pepper in it and buttery at the same time. great dish!   you could get a side of creamy grits or homestyle fries with the egg dishes. WOW these grits were so freakin good. i think they had goat cheese in them as well. so creamy and tasty.   my friend and her bf both got the scrambled egg enchilada. they said it was good.   overall i was very pleased with mesa grill. his dishes werent as spicy as i had expected, as hes always bringing in the heat, but everything had a nice balance of heat that you could still taste the flavors of the dishes. yeah bobby!",

    "text": "When I heard Bobby Flay owned this joint, I knew I had to try.... i watch Iron Chef religiously and I believe it caused my expectations to be alittle too high.   Bread basket: (yes, I consider this a course) disappointing. I like my bread warm and fresh from the oven. These offerings were too cold to enjoy.   Appetizers: got the romaine salad, gala apple salad, and the tiger shrimp tamale. I could have skipped all these dishes and saved more room for dessert. The tamale was good, but the flavors didn't have me singing to the high heavens... And the salads left much to be desired. The romaine salad lacked dressing and the croutons were way too soggy. The apple salad was mostly just chopped apple so it got too filling.   Main course: definitely get the lamb chops or the glazed salmon. Both were perfectly cooked and I licked my plates clean. Delish!! However, skip the collard greens. They weren't worth the stomach room. But the table next to ours were raving about the Brussels sprouts, so I wish I gave those a try.   Dessert: you can not leave the Mesa Grill without trying the Sticky Toffee Pudding. When i took my first bite the clouds parted, angels were singing, and all the stars aligned. This dessert will go down in the books! Yum, yum!   Bottom line: it was a good date night. More misses than hits for me. Will I return? Maybe if I'm craving some sticky toffee pudding.",

It was tamale overload cause each of our entrees came with a tamale and then there was the tamale from the tiger shrimp appetizer.  I'm not a big fan of tamales.",

    "text": "Prior to dining here what I've known about Bobby Flay: *D-bag that \"raised the roof yo!\" while standing on a cutting board in kitchen stadium in the episode he lost to Iron Chef Morimoto *Dude that always adds chiliquiles, poblano peppers, mango chutney, etc. to whatever dish he makes on Food Network *Guy that loses 90% of his Throwdown battles on food network for adding chiliquiles, poblano peppers, mango chutney, etc. to the dishes he makes in Throwdown  So yea the only reason I went here was b/c my friends wanted to eat here while we were in Vegas. I actually wanted to like this place & judging from the yelp reviews I thought..maybe it won't be so bad! Ugh..I was not impressed. For starters we ordered Sophie's Chopped Salad & the \"Queso Fundido.\" Sorry Sophie, but I think I could have made a better salad it was just a bunch of beans w/ pieces of lettuce & tortilla chips thrown in. The queso was served in a little skillet & was piping hot..but not in a good way more like it had been nuked in the microwave & had a layer of oil on top...no bueno.   I wasn't really in the mood for meat so I ordered the Mango spice tuna steak..since I'm allergic to nuts I asked the server not to put pine nuts in the cous cous. I really didn't care too much for the tuna steak..it had way too many peppercorns. The bf had the grouper & didn't really care much for it either. I think the only thing I liked was the margarita I ordered. So yea when I think of Mesa grill, I think of a bourgeosie Chili's or Chevy's where you're likely to find mango chutney or ancho chile sauce on the menu & where you can expect to spend over $100 on sub par Tex Mex food.",

The toasty, subtle taste of the goat cheese did not overpower my palette, which was good.  The pork tenderloin sandwich was delicious, and for $15 it was definitely worth it.    The prices here were very reasonable, considering what you got and compared to other restaurants in Vegas.  The service was also very good.  I will definitely come back here!",

My bride-to-be friend had an awful experience with her meal, however: two of her chicken strips weren't cooked through, one was almost entirely raw. There was pink everywhere. Salmonella = No bueno.   The service was impeccable, and our server removed the item from our bill.

Imagine my surprise, then, when it turned out to be my favorite meal of the trip.    The corn chowder tasted like a bowl of pure sunshine, with just a touch of kick.  Also sampled was the blue corn cake with BBQ duck, which was like a southwestern interpretation of a pulled pork sandwich.  And while I love the purity of enjoying a tamale or a chile relleno at a tiny storefront or, even better, in the kitchen of a Mexican momma, the way Mesa elevates both dishes to fine dining neither cheapens or lessens these dishes.    Only mild oddity was it seemed the majority of wines offered were French.  For some reason I assumed, considering the cuisine, to see a lot more Californian, Spanish, and Argentinean wines.  I did, however, have a sip of George's margarita.  Easily one of the best I've ever tasted.",

    "text": "Bobby Flay certainly has grilling down. I've been here three times (the last two within two months apart). As each visit progressed, it gradually became a better dining experience. My first time there, I was just not enthusiastic about it as I am now. But with my most recent experience, Mesa Grill definitely deserves 5 stars!  The first time, I had their coffee rubbed filet mignon. It sounds more interesting than it tastes. As in, it was kind of bland. I know you're not supposed to ask for sauce with your steak (and trust me- I don't like sauce with my steak) but I was seriously contemplating taking my steak back to my hotel room so I may secretly add A1 sauce.   The second time around, I ordered the snapper. My opinion of the place went up significantly. Not because of the snapper, but because I had a bite out of my sister's rib eye!!! BOY OH BOY! It was like melted gold on my tongue. This piece of cow melted in my mouth and slithered its own way all the way down my tummy. There it lay so happily until digestion took its course and brought it out to reality.   My last experience here was just short of two nights ago. I went with my Human Garbage Disposal. He was very excited to try Mesa Grill because he is a fan of Bobby Flay and I was enthusing about the infamous melt in your mouth rib eye. I ordered another fish- the grouper. Our food arrived, I looked at the huge rib-eye enviously and looked at my petite grouper. Whatever right? As soon as I took a bite out of the grouper, I pretty much dismissed all theatrics of the rib-eye and deemed the grouper the best dish I could ask for from Mesa Grill. So flavorful, so colorful, so tasty! And maybe it was my imagination, but the rib eye that I stole a bite from did not melt in my mouth. Dear grouper fish, never become extinct. And may Bobby Flay's minion chefs continue cooking you.   The end.",

Went to the bar to get some drinks and waited a long time to get the bar tenders attention to get a drink.  It was not crowded and she seemed annoyed by her job and was very unfriendly and unengaged.  After we were seated and ordered it took a long time to get our food in a half full restaurant.  Our waiter was very gruff and of little help in helping  with menu.  When the food finally arrived it was  tasty but they messed up our teen sons steak order. I could not get our waiter nor did he come by to check on our order.  Salmon and steaks were good but overall with the prices they charge and a very unengaged staff not sure it's worth it.  Too many other places that are good that want your business.",

The food overall was OK - I liked the flavors, but as it goes in Vegas, I was so stuffed from my previous meals, I don't think I enjoyed it as much as if I had eaten this is isolation (if that makes any sense).  But what was SUPERB this night was the SERVICE!  EXCELLENT SERVICE.  We were in a semi-rush to make our 7:30pm curtain call, and our waiter ensured that our food was out in time for us to enjoy our meal.  We even had to send our steak back to be re-grilled, and he did so quickly and courteously.  Rib eye - This was the highlight of the table - marbled and juicy, with a tangy teriyaki sauce.  As I mentioned above, we had to send it back to be regrilled (we asked for medium rare, but I think in their rush to get us to our show, it came out a bit rare), but it was PERFECT the second time around.  Highly recommend.  Corn side dish - You can't go wrong with sweet corn with cheese, cilantro, and lime.  I love tex-mex corn!  Halibut - The waiter recommended this fish over the salmon and tuna.  It was soft with a crispy top.  I think it was over-shadowed by the steak, but still good.  Chopped salad - Our attempt to balance out our meal with some ruffage.  Good.  Lobster taco - An appetizer I think we could have done without.  Doesn't really stand out in my mind at all, though I didn't appreciate that the waiter was able to give us 4 pieces to share (instead of the standard 3).  All in all, a solid meal, but would I come back?  Will all the options/restaurants on the strip?  Prob not...",

    "text": "Yeay for putting a twist on Mexican/Southern food.  And for not having long lines and instant seating. And having mango-carrot juice on your menu, Bobby Flay.  We originally intended to have breakfast at the Buffet at Caesar's Palace. But none of us wanted to wait for 45 mins to be able to eat. And definitely not when we were hungover.  Instant seating meant we could order coffee and juices pronto. The coffee was decent. And with multiple refills. The Mango-Carrot juice cured my hangover. And my friend & I loved it so much, we ended up ordering 2 servings each!  Our server was very sweet. Answered any question we had. And placed our orders pretty quick. The bread basket was very delicious. An eclectic blend of savory & sweet. The corn bread was yummaaaaaaay. And the chocolate brownie was melt-in-your-mouth yummy. Between the 4 of us, we sampled a few dishes on their brunch menu:  Goat cheese \"Fundido\" - While the dish does contain goat cheese, there's a strong flavor of other cheeses as well. Manchego being prominent. The corn chips that come with are fresh too. Beware, the dish is very rich, just as any other dish at Mesa.  Spicy Chicken w/ sweet potato hash - This is an offshoot of your eggs benedict. It's literally eggs benedict on top of a very uniquely made sweet potato hash brown. Very well presented. And equally tasty.  Spicy Scrambled eggs - This one had no chance. The husband inhaled it.   Scrambled eggs chilaquiles - This is a very rich dish with creme fraiche. I couldn't finish it and neither could my girl friend. It probably is the best in town. The potatoes that come with are so yummy. Get those, skip the grits.  Now, if you have cholesterol issues or are trying to lose a few lbs, Mesa is not the place for you. While the food is tasty, it's also very buttery/cheesy/oily. You might end up with heartburn, and give them one star less in the process.  Service was nice and on top of their job. Price was reasonable given that it's Las Vegas & Bobby Flay's place.  I'll go back... maybe after I drop a few lbs...",

    "text": "so here is the thing i came back here after having a pleasant experience last time in Vegas but this was the worst. first the host man was very nice. I was sat at a table from the time i was sat at the table the waiter seemed to not be feeling me. I dont know why. literally he approaced my tabled with an attitude like he didnt want to be bothered with me. i thought whatever just give me my food and ill be out. Let me tell you this man never came to check on me. i saw him when he took my order, when i asked for a new dish and that was it ill get to the rest.   So i ordered sophie or sophias salad something like that as I just wanted vegetables. it was ok needed more dressing and a cut of protein wouldnt have <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhurt.so&s=158be20918693dec93c42c0368a5fbfd9f7efaf0b2b4bd6839579fca18953263\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">hurt.so</a> im eating the salad and halfway through (its very small) when i see what can only be described as a produce sticker in the salad. ugghhhh so i waved him down (again this man never came to check on me) to tell him there was a piece of paper in the salad. he simply said oh ill take this back. I then see him walk all around the restaurant making stops with the tainted salad adn then he finally takes it back. he comes back about 5 minutes later and says they are going to get this to you as soon as they can. what you mean as soon as they can? its a barely there salad. the salad literally consisted of romaine, large blocks of white cheddar and some canned kidney and garbanzo beans and barely any dressing i say ok but im thinking what in the entire fIIK. there was NEVER and apology or any offer of a complimentary bread, 50cents off nothing!!  i dont know what the people are called who refill but the man who kept refilling my water and brought my bread was phenomenal!! idk how restaurants work but he definitely needs to be a waiter instead of just water, appetizer man ..he was great not only did he refill be he checked on me appropriately as most restaurants at intervals asking if i was ok. He was great !! he seriously needs to be promoted to waiter if thats how it goes. i didnt catch his name ..he looked eritrean or ethiopian to me.  so i finally finish the new salad and im just ready to get out of there at this point as i was over it. I waited and i waited and i waited and nothing. i was dining alone so I take all my stuff with me. im just going to the bathroom. NO LIE!! at this point i COULD have just walked out of the restaurant without paying. the host and a female were saying good bye to me. and i was like oh im just going to the bathroom.. damn my moral compass. i should have just walked out. .i was completely fed up at this point so when i leave the bathroom i literally stand next to my table like YOO!!! im ready to go where is the check and who shows up?? oh not my waiter of course not his sorry excuse of a waiter but the wonderful busboy/water refill person. and says do you want me to take care of that for you? i say please!!!! i guess protocol dictates waiters have to do it. bc next i see sorry waiter ringing up the bill. he brings the check back and says thanks and scurrys off ..  i wanted to leave a tip with the other guy personally so bad as i trust no one at this restaurant at this point but he had disappeared. i left the waiter no tip.. sorry this is why i cant subscribe to the oh they only make $2 a hour argument. Im suppose to pay you for poor service when thats your job....service!!! and you KNOW thats how you actually get paid and still give poor service ... ummm methinksnot..*sigh* i only went here bc the bacchanal buffet line was ridiculous i was clueless and uninformed at the time..i now know..but i dont plan to ever step foot in vegas again so im good",

I noticed that I was charged twice for my meal. I called the restaurant fully expecting top notch customer service and it took me calling back and a total of two days to get down to the problem. The waiter swiped my card for another person at our tables meal. So I was charged for mine and theirs.   The manager, John, literally had the audacity to tell me to call up one of the girls that I was with to get her to pay me. When I politely said no, he said well that's what the last couple this happened to did and they didn't mind... REALLY?!?! Then he asked for my address and said he was going to make the server send me money since it was his mistake.... Again REALLY?!?! So, here I sit writing this with still no closure or reassurance that I will get my money back unless I harass a girl I barely know for my money who lives over an hour away.

My wife can't take a lot of spice, so we got the blistered Serrano vinaigrette on the side, which proved to be a wise call, though it was tasty.   The main dishes just weren't quite as successful, though. My wife got the scrambled eggs chilaqules which were supposed to have a tomatillo sauce. I make my own tomatillo sauce all the time, and this wasn't one. It was made from hatch chilies or something similar. She didn't really enjoy it.   I got the green chile cheeseburger and wasn't terribly impressed. It was just too heavy and was in desperate need of acid or something to brighten it up. The fries, however, were delicious and well seasoned.   I'm sure some other main dishes might be more successful, but the apps, teas, and fries were world class.",

I started with the Chopped salad, interesting but not fantastic.  The Pork Tenderloin, however with a side of Brussel Sprouts was off the charts amazing. The flavors, the taste was everything you would expect of an Iron Chef.  It was so tender and perfectly cooked it was hard to tell it was pork. The spicy chipotle reduction sauce helped to make the dish. My gal ordered the salmon, also perfectly prepared and a side of spinach.    The ambiance is good but not great even though the restaurant itself is adorned with ceiling sculptures and has a very open feel for a place of its size. Seems they could dim the lighting a bit?

We order and I tell him I would like the Chilaquiles but not with scrambled eggs. He tells me that I can't change the eggs in that dish or any other dish on the menu in fact. Since poached eggs are pretty much the kings of brunch, I was a bit surprised by this. He went on to explain that the dishes are prepared and put together specifically and changing the eggs would change the dish so they don't do it. Show of hands - who actually prefers scrambled eggs? People who are scared of runny yolks, sure, but people who actually enjoy eating eggs - I would venture a guess never order them scrambled.  So I order the steak and eggs because it is the only way I can get none scrambled eggs. My friends order as well, a bread basket is brought and it is as delicious as everyone said. Then the waiting begins.  We waited at least 25 minutes for our food. We waited so long that one in our party had to leave early to go to the airport. They gave us a small percentage off for the waiting.   All in all the food was just average. My eggs were luke warm by the time we got our food and although the steak was good overall it wasn't anything special. Nothing that anyone got was really stood out.  Maybe the limited, inflexible brunch menu hindered our experience but overall between that and the long wait for a restaurant that wasn't even full my experience at Mesa Grill fell far short of my high expectations.",

Many servers took care of us, from water, to cocktails to the main meal, we felt we, the customer, were a priority. * Fabulous food! Fresh, warm from the oven bread and muffins, salmon cooked to perfection with a black bean sauce, rich lobster with hominy cakes, and a succulent rib-eye steak were our main meals. Sides included double baked potato with horseradish, mashed potatoes, and brussel sprouts with walnuts and pomegranate seeds. Everything was scrumptious!  * Restroom within the restaurant so we didn't have to wander back out onto the casino floor.  *** CONS *** * Not really a con, just a fact. Dinner is pricey! Menu prices start at $32, and do not include sides.",

We got seated near the kitchen so you can oversee the chefs grilling their steaks so it got a little warm in our area.  Definitely recommend trying the tiger shrimp tamales - a little spicy kick to them but balanced by a yummy creamy sauce and sweet corn tamales.  The spice rubbed pork tenderloin was very tender and the sauce definitely has a kick to it.  The blue corn tortilla encrusted halibut that my Mom had was really good - definitely recommend if you don't want to eat meat.  The fish was a good size and meat was flaky - the crust added a nice crunch and flavor to the overall dish.  My brother had the veal chops which came highly recommended by the waiter - they were definitely very tender and juicy.  Enjoyed the bread basket as well with a variety of walnut bread and corn muffins!",

I must say the jalapeno bread is worth an extra piece to begin your meal. For appetizers you can't go wrong with Blue Corn Lobster Tacos to start OR Goat Cheese Queso Fundido which will BLOW YOU AWAY! I also order the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin which gives you 3 BIG Pork Medallions with an Ancho Chile Sauce and Sweet Potato Tamale! TRUST ME this WILL fill you up! I always order extra Tamale and you HAVE to have the Roasted Corn Cotija, Cilantro, Lime & Smoked Chile Aioli. BEYOND WORDS! The wine list is extensive and the staff is excellent. If you get the chance have some dessert, be sure to split it with the table as you will fill up quickly on the apps and entrees, and always go with the coffee and zambuca to settle the stomach before you leave! This is LIGHT YEARS ahead of the New York location!",

It is a solid restaurant in Caesars where you don't have to get dressed up and they still treat you like you are the most important person in the restaurant.  I love how the service is top shelf.  We have been here 4 times and everytime the waiters deserved their tips.  Food is fantastic too!  This past trip we ate here for lunch.  They now have a $29 price fixed menu but we ordered off or the regular menu.  We started with the bbq duck blue corn pancake.  So awesome!  I could have ate this as my meal.  Next I had the chile relleno and my husband had poached eggs over pork and sweet potato hash.  Both were amazing.  No skimping on spice.  Everything was sooo good that I would have licked the plates.  We also had deserts.  The strawberry and gooseberry shortcake was recommended to us and we were glad to have tried it.  I though it was going to be lame but I was wrong.  It had the perfect amount of saltiness and tartness.  We also had the chocolate cornbread pudding.  Definitely not a favorite.  Really bizarre with a strange after taste.  Not bad but just not my thing.  We will definitely return on our next trip.",

Tiger Shrimp and Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale (4 Stars) Good flavor and nice texture.  Just simply delicious.    2. Coffee Rubbed Filet Mignon (3 Stars) Nicely cooked medium rare.  Didn't quite get the coffee taste.  The rubbed crust didn't do much for the dish in my opinion  3. Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin (4 Stars) The dish was nicely cooked with big flavors.  The spiciness wasn't overpowering, and you can taste the layering of flavors.  The sweet potato tamale was wonderful.  This is the signature dish that everyone should try at Mesa Grill.  4. Churros (2 Stars) The chocolate dip provided good flavor, but the churros were fried for a little too long.  The center became too dry.  I still think Rick Bayless' XOCO in Chicago has the best churros.",

    "text": "I came here with my sister while we were on our whirlwind trip to Vegas and am SO glad this is where we decided to have dinner.   Both she and I were feeling rich and starving, because we opted to order a slew of appetizers and a few side orders in addition to too many partida margaritas. Phenomenal margaritas by the way, nicely balanced and no sickeningly sweet cloying mix taste - at $12 a pop they better be good! Everything we ordered (blue corn pancake w/duck, tuna nachos, queso fundido, chile relleno, and mashed potatoes with queso sauce) was freaking delish. My personal favorite was the blue corn pancake because the duck was perfect - tender, smokey and sweet without even a hint of gamey-ness. I was also very surprised by how good the chile relleno was with it's thick hard cornmeal crust and bean/rice/mash in the middle. This was not your average deep-fried cheese stuffed pepper.   And yes, after all that, we ordered dessert. The coconut cake is ridiculous. I mean seriously, it was so good that our waiter literally had to pry me off of it so that we would make it to our show on time. Each layer was soaked in some sort of coconut cream concoction and every bite was full of toasted coconut flakes, gooey cake and icing. I kept thinking about it all night. I'm still thinking about it!   This was definitely a luxurious treat and I'd highly recommend it to anyone else looking for a nice dinner while in Vegas.",

As is typical with any brunch menu, it's rather abbreviated to have a smattering of southern style egg dishes/grits/biscuits... all good.  Will be honest, was here more for a traditional lunch and would've loved to have more options, but is what it is.  bc what we chose was still great.  We shared the CAN\"T MISS Appi, Tiger Shrimp tamale, which is an everyday appi on their brunch and dinner menu.  U just cannot go here without trying this appi.  Wife had a lamb/cobb salad. Pretty fantastic flavors with the most awesome bacon ever.  Lamb was cooked delightfully so with great flavor.  Fresh, fresh, fresh yet also very light.  I got the pork tenderloin sandwich with caramalized red onion and arugula.  Very much a panini sandwich, but the pork was super flavorful and very tender.  Fries were tasty, but didn't want to feel all gross and just ate a portion of that.    Overall for lunch, would've loved to have some more options to choose from but that's what u get with brunch.  Nonetheless, it was a fantastic lunch.  The bread basket was pretty yummy with the assortment of fresh breads/biscuits/scones.  The service was attentive and exceptional.  For anyone dining for dinner.... DO DO DO get the Honey Chipotle glazed Rib Eye, OH MY!!!  it's dang good.",

I had actually been craving the roasted chicken and brussel sprouts from my last visit (and I normally NEVER order chicken, but their preparation is so flavorful and moist), so imagine my disappointment when they were both absent from the menu.  However, this disappointment didn't last long when my perfectly prepared Fire Roasted Veal Chop was placed in front of me.  My husband and friend both ordered the 22 oz. rib-eye. If you order this, come hungry! We shared a couple delicious appetizers and sides, but even the bread alone is so delicious.    My 2 year old daughter (who also has quite the palate) was with us and we were able to order from an off-menu children's dinner for $18.  We ordered the roasted chicken and mashed potatoes for her, and she enjoyed every bite.  It was such a refreshing change to have a beautifully presented child's meal, instead of the typical chicken fingers and french fries.     One of the perks of living in Las Vegas is the fact I have a plethora of great restaurants to choose from.  This restaurant is always busy, so make reservations in advance.",

    "text": "Walking around in Caesars, we quickly realized that we needed more drinks and some food. At that moment, we found ourselves in front of Mesa Grill and walked up to the bar.  I have been to Mesa many times before, but the first time we just decided to just sit at the bar instead of getting a table. I actually found my experience at the bar far more enjoyable and oddly enough, a lot cheaper than usual. They only have an appetizer menu at the bar, but when all of the food is good like it is at Mesa, it really isn't a big deal and there is something for everyone. The only disappointment was they had taken their calamari off the menu (both the bar and standard menu)... Sad considering I was really looking forward to it.  While we were there, some random guy who is completely drunk and blitzed out of his mind, walks right up to us and goes on and on about this magician, Chris Randall, that he knows and who works at Mesa. He was shocked we had no idea who this magician was and for the next 15 minutes, he repeatedly was saying that we had to Google Chris Randall. He then gets the bartender involved and repeats his tirade. The bartender doesn't know anyone who works there by that name. The drunk guy asks for the manager and repeats the tirade again. No one knows who he is talking about, he gives us random door passes to some club (yes, the same ones they pass out on the bridges between the hotels) and he promptly leaves. It was pretty funny because he was just annihilated drunk. And yes... when I got home from my trip, I did Google the guy's name (turns out he is a local Vegas magician). LOL  Anywho, if you haven't tried the bar at Mesa Grill, you should definitely check it out. The service is great, the appetizers at Mesa are a foodies bar food, and if your lucky, you will get some random drunk strike up a conversation to where you can laugh about the experience with the bartender for the rest of the night.",

This trip it was planned into the itinerary.  His cooking style seems so close to what we like, how could it go wrong?  It could sadly enough and it all began with a margarita.  We know our ritas.  And we know what a Partida margarita should taste like.  I think this was almost straight lime juice for almost $15 a cocktail.  Such a disappointment.    The sandwiches weren't bad - but they weren't fantastic.  Well I thought so.  The new wife hated her roast beef sandwich which was served ice cold.  Mine was just okay- nothing wonderful.  For something we waited almost 3 years craving - talk about a sad lunch.  Oh well! Now we know and I'll avoid Mr Flay's restaurants from here on out!",

It was flavored to perfection and juicy as can be.  Our caesar salad to start was also excellent.  The star of the lunch, however, were the Margaritas.  Mesa doesn't fool around with fillers and packaged ingredients and the quality shines through starting with the Tequilla and the fresh squeezed lime juice.  It was a smooth as you could imagine.",

Recently Bourdain has said that Bobby deserves more than just that show on Food TV where he gets embarrased by cooking local food against a local and having the audience like *suprise* the local's food better.  But that's Bourdain's opinion.  He hasn't been to Mesa Grill.   For being such a world renowned egotistical chef, you'd think he'd be able to put money where his mouth is.  I gave him a fair chance (3 courses + drinks) but he disappointed me to no end.  The one thing he got right- smokiness. He was able to really capture the smoke in the soup.  Unfortunately he also ODed the soup on Cumin.  Eh, mediocre.  The scallops were filled with Cumin.   What does a kid from NY know about Mexican food?  Good question.  Answer? Cumin.  That's it.  One word to describe Bobby Flay's food at Mesa? Cumin.  Well how about 3 words?  GOD AWFUL CUMIN.   I think Bobby went down to Mexico to learn how to cook, they showed him the Cumin spice and that's the end.   Who likes food to all taste the same?  If I wanted that I'd go to McDonalds.  At least I would have been... what's the word?  Satisfied.",

Wow, that was an amazing dish.  I usually shy away from cioppino because I'm not that big on tomato broth.  Green chile sauce makes it more than worthwhile.  My wife had a grilled chicken that had mango salsa and 12 spices (that's one more than you get at KFC).  Dessert was another great creation.  We split an order of the churros that came with a chocolate sauce that was flavored with star anise.  The waiter recommended it.  It often pays to listen to what dishes they recommend.  Another standout dish I had on a past visit was the pork tenderloin.  Absolutely amazing chile sauces with that one, also.  The strawberry shortcake that time was good, but not nearly as good as the churros.  Also, I have to give kudos to the service.  The staff was more than friendly throughout the evening.  This restaurant is a must, whether in Vegas or New York (though Vegas is much easier to get into than NYC).",

He seemed very down to earth and I enjoyed learning about how his success had such humble origins.  All the backstory aside, this truly is an amazing restaurant.  So the decour is unique and he uses quite interesting colors but besides all of that kind of stuff, the food simply tastes amazing.  I mean even a simple Rib eye steak isn't just a good piece of meat.  It's an AMAZINGLY beautiful juicy work of art.  The tiger shrimp tamale and the wild mushroom quesadilla were just delicious.  Even the Mojito was awsome!  I don't know what to say.  Bobby Flay deserves all the fan fare he gets.  He truly is an Iron Chef and his restaurant Mesa Gril is a place I'd love to go back to time and again.  I am sooo looking forward to trying Bolo, his New York restaurant whenever I get around to visiting the east coast again.  Just know it's a bit expensive ($117 for dinner for 2) and the wait can be long so make reservations and be on time.",

Also, with this meal came with a tamale it was not edible, I would think a  chef of this caliber would have a restaurant that showed his expertise. I cook a lot and I would not have put out dinner like this. Also, at our table we ordered the halibut it just was boring. Don't make the same mistake that I did. Do \"NOT\" go to this restaurant. I am convinced that good food is not on the strip. Stay off the strip if you are a foodie like me.",

It was also totally worth it.  My husband had the side of corn for something like $8, and I thought \"Eight dollars for corn?!\".  And then I tried it.  And it was amazing.  He had the tuna steak and I had the quesadilla appetizer as my entree, and it was so rich and delicious I needed help finishing it.  My sister and brother in law ate off a prix-fix menu, and were very pleased with theirs as well.  I will say that the service was slower than I had anticipated, though to be fair it was a Saturday night.  The food was absolutely outstanding.  Would love to go here again, and the food is definitely good enough to warrant the price tag.",

The decor of the place is vibrant and feels youthful. There was no prix fixe menu at the moment, bummer. The bread basket was nice and tasty (I think they had 3 variety of breads). Heck I even asked for 2nd batch and took it home.  1. For appetizers, I ordered the Goat Cheese Queso Fundido w/ Rajas and Ha had the Tiger Shrimp Tamale with roasted garlic cream sauce. Both appetizers were great. I love goat cheese, so using that kind of cheese for a queso fundido was great, but the rajas really added nice flavor. The Tiger Shrimp Tamale was incredible. The masa was nice and light, and the shrimp were seasoned nicely. You need to soak up as much of the sauce as possible. I know its fatty, but who counts calories these days?  2. For Entrees, I ordered the New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin w/ Sweet Potato Tamale and she ordered The Fire Roasted Veal Chop w/ Wild Rice Tamale. Again, both dishes were superb. My Pork tenderloin was cooked to a perfect medium and the sauces that accompanied the dish were delicious, but spicy (which is good for me). That Sweet Potato Tamale aided with the bold flavors. The Veal Chop was velvety, spicy, and absolutely great.   3. Sorry, we were too full and did not order desert.  Overall the total was around $120, but hey its Vegas and you expect to spend that amount for a nice dinner! Worth every penny. I'm coming back here and would recommend it!",

I'd heard good things about the NYC Mesa Grill, so I figured this place would at least have some edible food. Error on my part.  The food bumps this review down to one star. The waitstaff could not have been nicer, which I why I'm bumping it back up to two. But honestly, don't you usually go to a place like this for the food?  There are three sauces: an off-white one, an orange one and a dark brown one. Add some combination of these three to a meat or veggie substance and you've got your entire menu. Creative, it ain't. Our party of eight tried just about everything.  Not much flavor to the sauces or the dishes in general. Boring is the word that comes to mind. What kills me is that our waiter spent about half his time telling us \"don't worry, nothing on the menu is spicy!\" He might as well have said \"don't worry, nothing on the menu is flavorful!\" I have no problem with mild food, but it's a little weird at a southwestern themed restaurant.  I can recommend the cactus pear cocktail though. That was tasty, and maybe after a few of them you won't notice the lack of flavor in the food.",

The service was friendly and helpful and the atmosphere was very cool and funky with a southwestern flair.  The food was just what we hoped for: bold flavors in the southwestern family with little \"wow\" touches.  Celebrity chef restaurants get some flack since the standards are so high and everyone likes to poke holes in them, but I have to say that we had a fantastic meal.   We started with the smoked chicken and black bean quesadilla, which was the best quesadilla we've ever had (sorry reviewer Jen Y!).  The quesadilla itself is quite tasty with a great cheesy, smoky filling, but the toasted garlic creme fraiche was amazing.  Even better were the little slivers of fried garlic.  They were crispy and awesome.  I'd love to have a bowlful of those - you'd have bad breath for about a month, but it would be worth it!  For our entrees, I had ancho chile-honey glazed salmon and my wife had the Yucatan chicken tacos.  The salmon was perfectly cooked with a wonderfully sweet-spicy-smoky glaze, and the sauces that came along with it were simply divine. One order of fried garlic chips and jalapeno  crema, please!  The Yucatan chicken tacos were also delicious with a fantastic, with the roasted peanut barbecue sauce being a pleasant diversion from the usual barbecue sauce flavors.    For dessert, I highly suggest the sampling plate so you don't have to make up your mind.  All three on the plate were excellent, but the warm chocolate cake was my favorite.",

Apps:  Blue corn duck pancake and the smoked chicken quesadilla. The pancake seemed to be an after-thought to the duck, which was the main event. Tender and smoky, cooked really well. Unfortunately, the sauce was overwhelmingly sweet and we couldn't detect many other flavors. The quesadilla was just that- the quality was good, but the flavors a bit bland.    Mains:  Filet Mignon rubbed with special seasoning was spicy and cooked to perfection. \"Like buttah,\" in the words of my date, and a ridiculously large portion size. Chili Relano was divine! Oozing, melting Oaxacan cheese with a biting, peppery and cornmeal finish.   Overall, the entrees were, on there own 5 stars.  Cocktails: Only tried one each due to aforementioned service issue, but black widow mojito was excellent. Mildly sweet, with a distinctive taste of anise- perfect amount of alcohol.",

Next we had the spicy chicken sweet potato hash. If that dish had a vagina my boyfriend would have left me for it. Perfect amount of heat! Highly suggest both dishes.  Service was great, everybody happy and very helpful with the menu. They spoke highly of their chef as well. 3 different types of bread are given to you when you sit down, still warm! My only regret of this meal was not asking for more bread.  Hands down one of the best meals I've ever had. All hail Bobby!!!",

    "text": "Probably one of the best gourmet restaurants I have ever visited and I have visited a great deal in my life time.  This place offers great service, fabulous food and relaxed and inviting environment.   We visited Mesa grill twice in one day.  We started with their breakfast/brunch, which impressed us so much that we decided to go back for dinner.  Their brunch menu is so unique, so refreshing that I cannot say enough about it to convince you to try.  Just take my word for it and give them a try. I posted a few pics which should tell you what I am trying to establish here with words.   For dinner, we were pleased even more.  We ordered two of their New York steak dinners, and salmon dish and their lamb chop dish.  All 4 were extraordinarily delicious and well prepared. We even ordered a bottle of blend red wine which really complimented our steak and lamb dishes.   My hat is off to Mr. Bobby Flay for creating such an exciting menu and for great execution.  Keep up the good work guys and see you next time...",

For an iron chef the menu hardly changes and the attitude seems to be we are a veteran Vegas restaurant and we don't need to try hard. That being said the old standby dishes were excellent and perfectly cooked. The cactus pear margaritas are worth the trip. I just wish they'd try a bit harder to stay relevant. I'd hate see Mesa Grill go away.",

There was only a handful of tables, and our server was great - just the right amount of interaction... attentive and offered his opinion without being intrusive.  We shared the blue corn pancake with bbq duck appetizer, the smoked shrimp tacos and the cornmeal crusted chile relleno.  The appetizer was tasty and I understand these are Vegas prices, but I just couldn't get over being charged $15 for a single 3 inch taco/pancake (it was folded in half like a taco).  The entrees were both plated very nicely, but I felt that all 3 items tasted the same, like they used the same sauce in all their dishes.  I would rate the service 4 stars and the food 2 stars. My sister enjoyed the food more than I did, so I'm ok giving it 3 stars overall.  However, I doubt I will be going back again.",

    "text": "Because we were going to the Mariah Carey concert at the Collosseum in Caesar's later in the evening, we wanted something near the concert venue.  Mr. Flay's establishment fit the bill perfectly.  Despite making a reservation through OpenTable, they could not find our reservation when we arrived.  Luckily, they were not crazy busy and could seat us.  Initially, the host left us with the wine/cocktail menu, and I was disappointed not to see any margaritas listed.  I thought this place was known for margaritas.  However, when our server came over and introduced himself, he asked if we wanted to see the margarita menu.  Uh, duh!  YES!  Quit toying with us!  He provides the menu and gives a few moments to contemplate.  I am torn between the cactus pear and white peach.  I opt for the cactus pear, and my husband choses smoke on the water or something like that, it's mezcal based.  My cactus pear is a tad too sweet, and my husband didn't care for his, but I liked it.  Then the bread basket arrives and all the breads are delicious, but I am smitten with the jalapeno one.  We try not to fill up as we decide to share the mushroom quesadilla with fried egg and salsa verde as an appetizer.  It arrives and we enjoy it as we eavesdrop on the table next to us, and hear one of the women ask, \"Is Bobby here?\"  The server says no, he comes in the spring time.  (Ok, note to self, come back in the spring!)  For entrees, so many enticing choices, and I chose the mango spice crusted tuna steak.  My husband chose the 16 spice chicken and a side of sauteed spinach.  I was very happy with my choice and gobbled it up.  I also ordered another margarita, the Partida with a lot of salt on the rim.  I preferred this one over the cactus pear.  As for my husband, he said the chicken was just ok. I didn't taste the chicken, but I did taste the cilantro pesto mashed potatoes that accompanied the chicken, and they were excellent.  In my husband's opinion, the trick with the food was simply to add some sweet/savory chili sauce.  He believed even he could make the chicken (although he doesn't cook).  So if I'm not mistaken, I do believe that he indirectly challenged Bobby Flay to a throw down.  Now we really need to return in the spring time!  No dessert for us, we reached maximum capacity.  Service is spot on here.  I'd gladly return!",

I had the black bean tostada and plantain tamale and both were solid choices. My friend ordered the chicken, which was a nice-sized portion, so if you do order an entree, you are getting plenty of food.   The margaritas were strong but not overpowering. And we went for a meal later in the evening so there wasn't a wait at all. The menu seems to have one of each protein on its menu, so I had hoped for some more Tex-Mex standard options. But I would eat here again, especially due to its convenience being near the Colosseum if you're going to a show.",

While waiting for my orders, they served some complimentary bread. There were three kinds, but the jalapeno corn bread was the most remarkable. It was crumbly yet still moist. I had the tamale and the flavors were bursting in my mouth. Shrimps cooked nicely, NOT overcooked. I particularly liked the accompaniment of corn and cream with it. My shrimp tacos were just okay. The tortillas were good, mango paired with the shrimps had good flavors but I was expecting more \"iron-chefly\" than the tacos I had.   My bill was around $50 without the tip. Good experience at Mesa, but I think it's an overkill. ;)",

    "text": "Mesa Grill is Chef Bobby Flay's restaurant for those who did not know this.  It is located inside of Caesars Palace.  I've watched Bobby Flay cook on TV and the food always looked good, so out of curiosity, I wanted to actually try out his food.  He tends to favor Southwestern and Cajun style dishes.    My bf and I were immediately seated during lunch time.  The place was surprisingly not busy at all and there were many empty tables.  Our waitress came by and gave us menu and took our drink orders.  She was very attentive and knowledgeable.  She recommended the Tiger Shrimp + Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale, the Ancho Chile-Honey Glazed Salmon, and the Smoked Shrimp Taco.  She said that these were their best sellers.  After looking over Yelp for some recommendations, we decided to go with what the waitress recommended.  Next, she delivered bread and butter to the table.  There were three different kinds of breads and each one had a different flavor, but they were all pretty good.  Don't eat too much of it though otherwise you will be too full when the real meal comes.  When our Tiger Shrimp + Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale came, it was presented beautifully and had corn kernels and a tasty creamy cilantro sauce.  This dish was delicious and I liked how it was seasoned perfectly.  It wasn't bland and the flavoring was not overwhelming either.  It was just right.  The only downside for me was the price of the appetizer which was $19!  I thought that was pretty expensive for a fairly small portion.  The Smoked Shrimp Tacos came with red cabbage slaw, grilled tortillas, avocado, tomatillo & mango salsas.  My bf really enjoyed the tacos and thought they were delicious!  The dish only came with two tacos though and the dish was for $25.  My Ancho Chile-Honey Glazed Salmon came with a spicy black bean sauce, tomatillos, and a roasted jalapeno creama.  My salmon was cooked to perfection.  For someone who hates beans, the dish was very good and all of the ingredients went really well together.  This dish too was $25.  Overall, our service was excellent and our food was really good!  I would highly recommend trying out the dishes that we had ordered.  However, the prices of the food is kind of expensive for small portions.  If you have the funds to try Mesa Grill, I'd highly recommend it.  Maybe go play some slots and win big before coming here.",

    "text": "Was there for dinner this past weekend with family. We made a reservation for Monday night thinking that there would be a lot of people but you can actually just walk in and be seated right away since it was a weekday. The ambiance was good and We had a nice server. We really liked their complimentary starter spicy muffin, it was so good and still nice and warm we asked for seconds. We ordered Bobby's signature dish the prawns with tamale, the pork tenderloin, lamb tacos, tuna tar tar,  pesto mashed potatoes, and the charcoal carrots. The prawns tamale was very good, although I wish they would give a few more pieces of prawns or one more tamale as there was only 4 prawns for the dish. Everything else was very good. We thought the taste of the carrots was very delicious and out of the ordinary the way it was made and the cool plating style. Although, would have made the experience even MORE better of Bobby Flay was there! :D",

I started with the lobster taco and my husband had the duck pancake - both seasoned exactly right. My veal chop was huge and the waiter wisely suggested I hold off on ordering a side - he was sure right! The combination of maple and horseradish with the Southwestern flavors was balanced and new. My husband had the strip steak with a side of corn - also dead on in terms of prep and seasoning.  We really weren't hungry for dessert - but who cares? We had the chocolate cake (a bit sweet) and banana cream pie (beautiful - again an ideal play of textures and taste).  A great dinner to close off our Vegas trip!",

    "text": "In the early days of Food Network, I held an inexplicable grudge against Bobby Flay.  His only show at the time was the original Grillin and Chillin where he was partnered up with a bona fide hick in overalls.  Then Bobby caused all sorts of hullaballoo by standing on his cutting board.  Over time, I slowly began to accept that he really was not so bad as a personality and possibly even good as a chef.  So personality differences aside, I made a brunch reservation for Mesa Grill on my most recent visit to Las Vegas.    The bread basket made an immediate impact.  It contained two types: a jalapeno cheddar bread and a corn muffin.  The jalapeno cheddar bread was not at all a wallflower.  It packed a really spicy kick from the peppers and a salty crust from the cheese.  The corn bread was soft and airy and could barely be buttered.     We ordered two appetizers, one of which was the rough cut tuna nachos.  I was ready to dismiss this altogether because everyone knows rough cut tuna nachos means Mexicanafied tuna tartar.  Well, yes, but it was such a different and delicious dish that I would not make such lame generalizations again.  The blue corn chips were freshly fried and incredibly crisp.  The tuna was not a dice/mash of tuna odds and ends but beautiful jeweled cubes of red tuna.  It seemed to be the perfect compliment to the cool avocado crema and the spicy mango habanero hot sauce.  When we ordered this our server went out of his way to warn us that the tuna was going to be served raw.  This is Vegas after all and how horrifying might it be for someone to expect canned tuna on tortilla chips and get this beautiful thing instead?   The next appetizer was equally delicious and one that most people rave about.  A moist tamal has been covered with sauteed tiger shrimp and a garlic cream sauce.   It was a nice change of pace to dip the tender shrimp and masa into the velvety sauce.    For his entree, John ordered the New Mexico spiced pork tenderloin sandwich grilled red onion, arugula, ancho chili mayo and spicy fries.  This was a perfectly good sandwich but not as memorable as the other things we tried.  The pork was room temperature and I would have much preferred it hot and freshly sliced.    The only dish I might not get again was my own.  I grew up eating homemade chile rellenos and this version was little too clean and precise.  The chile was very neatly and uniformly coated in a cornmeal crust and stuffed with manchego and roasted eggplant.  The cornmeal was crisp but too thick and I much prefer queso fresco to the much more pungent taste of the goat's milk manchego. I did however, like the sweet and sour combination of the red pepper and balsamic vinegar sauces.   I must give Senor Flay some credit.  It was a really good meal and he really has a way with flavors and sauces.  He didn't shy away from authentic ingredients and a good amount of heat.  We easily classified it as one of our better meals of the trip.",

    "text": "LVRW2012: My preconceptions of Mesa being 'over-rated' have been squashed. My love for Anthony Bourdain turned me into an Flay-hater for no reason. Everyone has seen that episode of No Reservations--yes? Well, sorry for all the mean words Bobby. I'm the newest fan of Mesa Grill!  FIRST: The Tiger Shrimp & Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale is a signature Bobby Flay dish. I think my server saw me drool a little. I tried to be casual as I scraped every last bit of sweet masa from the corn husk and scooped up every last bit of that buttery sauce. This is the tamale of my dreams.  SECOND: This is the way a Green Chile burger is supposed to taste: juicy and flavorful. The burger was cooked exactly to my specifications and had the most wonderful flavor. It was huge and a little difficult to eat. But I made it work. Little to no heat, but more sweet and savory which was definitely up my alley.  DESSERT: If you've ever eaten a spoon full of shaving cream, you'll know how the key lime sorbet tasted. Not that I regularly eat shaving cream, but every time I took the spoon to my mouth that's all I could think about. The fruit compote spiked with chili was not my cup of tea. I'll be direct and say it was awful. I would've traded this for another tamale.  I downed a few of those White Peach Bellinis, but I stopped at 3 to avoid looking like a drunk at 11:30am on a Sunday. Adds up at $12 a glass, but quite refreshing. My server was polite, formal, and attentive. CELEBRITY DOPPELGANGER: he looked just like Robert Irvine from Dinner: Impossible!  The savory dishes were a positive slap in the face. Bobby Flay has some swag in the kitchen and Mesa serves up some good food. Just know that dessert can be purchased at CVS for about $2 a can.... *kidding* *not really*",

They provide you w/ some awesome bread(I prefer the nutty bread...I think i ate like 5-6..) Oh just to let you know they have jalapeno pop bread that they only have during brunch(so when we came here for lunch they didn't have it :() .  They have some similarities of food for brunch and lunch but we tried to avoid getting the same thing as brunch.  We had the Smoked chicken + black  bean quesadilla, shrimp tamales, Swordfish, and cornmeal crusted chile relleno.  I thought the smoked chicken quesadilla was pretty tasty. I think they grilled/fried the skin so it be crispy when you eat it and obviously goes well w/ avocado. I love the Garlic Creme Fraiche.  Shrimp tamales: I liked it more the first time I had it but it was still really tasty. I thought it was a bit oversalted this time around but the shrimp was very good. I love the corns that are in it.  Cornmeal crusted chile rellano- eh. Maybe it would be better w/ some kind of meat but it was a bit lackluster for me. Could use some more spice as well. It was pretty cool to see a whole pepper covered in cornmeal but it was very dry due to it as well. Barely got any eggplant in there as well.  Swordfish: I thought this was absolutely delicious. The swordfish was cooked in perfection and had a GREAT sauce to go along w/ it. I love the cream green chile rice. It was kinda like risotto but less mushy. It was just an overall very tasty and seasoned dish.   I would recommend it to anybody. It's a bit on the heavier side but I think it's definitely worth a try. Love their bread :3",

But we still thought we should give this place a try while we were here.  We stopped in for an early lunch and were seated right away. (we had tried for dinner the previous night, but they were totally booked).  We started with a margarita, which was absolutely delicious (much more flavorful than anything you get sitting in a casino, of course).  For food, we got the cremini mushroom quesadilla (omg, amazing), the ancho chili salmon (yummy, great sear on the fish, but not spicy enough for us) and the shrimp tacos (tasty shrimp, but see below for my thoughts on the 'salsas')  The things that stuck out were the following: The plating was beeeeaaaauuutiful. Everything looked a lot better than it tasted... The mango habanero 'salsa' that accompanied the tacos was awful. It looked and tasted like baby food. Not nearly enough habanero...or really anything other than mango. I really should have tasted it before putting it in my taco because it really ruined it. Ick.  We asked our waiter for something spicy to eat with the fish and he brought us a delicious chipotle sauce. I wanted to take home a bottle of it.  All in all, we had a pleasant meal here. I probably wouldn't return, only because there are a billion and a half other places to try here. But, I was not disappointed.",

Went there for restaurant week and my friend ordered the shrimp tacos.  Usually when you order a taco plate at a restaurant they list how many comes with it.  Mesa didn't and I had a funny feeling about it, like there would only be 2 instead of 3 which you find at most places.    Not only was I right to be suspicious about that, but when they came out she had to put them together herself.  It was like someone threw the ingredients on a plate, after they were cooked, and expected the diner to put them together.  Really?  I ordered the burger, and it was okay, but at $16 I've had burgers for half the price be twice as good a countless number of times.    Mesa, the only bad restaurant in Caesar's, don't go if you don't have to.",

Menu is a bit small/limited and mimosas add up at a pricey $12 a flute, but their tiger shrimp tamale and spicy chicken sweet potato hash has me looking forward to coming back to give their full dinner menu a try.

Exceptional atmosphere, service including spot on advice on doneness for grilled meats that yielded just about the best chops (veal and lamb) dinners. The negative reviewers must have dined at a different Mesa as my meal at Mesa was outstanding. Proximity to Caesar's Coliseum made for an easy move from dinner to the Seinfeld show.",

    "text": "Another delicious night at Mesa Grill! We love the friendly and courteous service. We came a little before our reservation and they were able to seat us. The wait staff is very attentive and checked on us several times.  We ordered the Tiger Shrimp and roasted garlic Tamale ($19), spice rubbed pork tenderloin ($37), Mango+Spice crusted Tuna Steak ($38), steamed Halibut ($38), Sweet potatoes Au Gratin with maple butter, and the Churros ($12).  The tamale was delicious. The sweet shrimp and corn balance perfectly with the tamale. It was a great start to the meal. The pork tenderloin was very tender. The rub was very spicy but still balanced when eaten with the tamale that comes with the meal. The tuna was smoky and almost too spicy for my daughter,  it it was so delicious that she managed. :) The peppercorns were a fun surprise and tasty with the couscous. My steamed halibut was the less flavorful of the three entrees. The fish was a little over cooked and leaning towards the rubbery side. I probably would not order it again. It was not as memorable as the other two dishes. The sweet potato side dish was so yummy. It was verging on too sweet with the sweet potatoes and the maple, but still delicious. The churros for dessert were delicious. We all loved the dulce de leche sauce the best. A sweet ending to a delicious meal.",

EVERYTHING was presented beautifully and tasted amazing. I recommend the shrimp tamale for an appetizer and DO NOT skip out on dessert, the sticky pudding was to die for!! We all had margaritas, Their original lime margarita was the table favorite, followed by peach, the prickly cactus was on the sweet side. I WILL dine here again.",

He is known for southwestern/Mexican flavors.   I didn't need a reservation though suspect one is needed during peak hours.  The tables are a bit close together but I was seated next to some nice folks that I enjoyed talking to and sharing thoughts on the food.    My waitress was very helpful offering me a sampling of the three breads-I particularly liked the corn muffin- and took my drink order.  She recommended the tiger shrimp garlic corn tamale for an appetizer and I was glad I took her recommendation.  It was delicious.  The cilantro sauce was really tasty.  For the entree, I had the grilled mahi mahi that came with creamy green chile rice, yellow pepper mole and cilantro and green chile vinaigrette.  This was another delicious dish.    Service was excellent throughout the meal.  I glanced at the dessert menu that had many tempting items but was too full to partake.  The prices aren't cheap but for the quality of the meal and service, I found it to be very reasonable (wines are 12-19 dollars per glass; appetizers were $12.00, entrees were $33 to $60-higher priced items were the steaks.  Desserts were $12.00.  It was an excellent meal and I hope to go back some other time.",

Shrimp tamale appetizer for $20- too bad it was tasteless and shrimp was over cooked and low quality. Margaritas- apparently they are known for these but they were basic at best. I'm starting to think \"best thing I ever ate\" is designed to promote certain restaurants but not because they're actually good. This place just isn't good, at all. They would definitely be out of business if it weren't for tourists keeping this place busy. Save your money and go to Hot n Juicy (or anywhere else!). Oh and it was also great seeing the chef blow his nose in a rag and throw it in the hamper and went back to cooking without washing his hands. Yum!",

We ordered from the summer menu and had the tamale and kale salad appetizer to begin our meal. Those were the best part of the meal. The bread looked appetizing but was just okay. A glass of house Chardonnay cost $16 each. The salmon was served ala carte with a bland sauce. It was a small piece of salmon that was mediocre at best. The pork was also mediocre. The chocolate pudding was very ordinary. I am a huge fan of Bobby Flay and am always amazed when he beats most chefs on his show \"Beat Bobby Flay.\" Perhaps I had high expectations of this restaurant based on that and his amazing flavor profiles on his show. $200 later and I wished I had put my money in the slot machines. It would've been more rewarding. The 3 stars are for the appetizers and the good service.",

    "text": "You kidding me? If you want to eat with the world's \"fray\" then eat here in this roadside diner atmosphere (read some reviews below mine.  Basically same comment).  I knew instantly when we stepped in for our reservation this is the wrong place to be (my wife insists since she watches the show).  We sat down and the table and chairs WREAKED of vomit (no kidding). We asked for a different table and were given a \"so what do you expect us to do? Someone vomited. Get over it\" attitude.  And we responded: \"What do you expect us to do? Eat in vomit?\"  Manager came out and he capped off the deal for us (his attitude was no different.  He had horribly poor training in customer service). As we walked out I saw a guy giving it sort of a skeptical 'look over' as he was giving his reservation time at hostess stand.  I gave him the inside scoop and he quickly took protective hold of his wife's arm and escorted her out (before she caught something).  We (actually) ate there the night before at the bar and the appetizers were not bad.  Bar and bar food? It's OK.  But restaurant. Naw, I'd rather eat a neon-lit diner out in the desert and swat at desert flies around me.  The world's fray? You can have this place.  (PS the bar tenders though there are TERRIFIC guys.  But I feel for them.  I really do.)  NOTE: there are indeed some other amazing intimate restaurants very near this one, so you don't have to look to far for a adequate, high-quality good choice.",

This year we came during lunch and I ordered the lamb cobb salad, and my colleague got the shrimp tacos.   First of all, the service is great. The waiters are friendly, professional, and knowledgeable about their dishes. Secondly, the bread. I usually try to avoid bread but this is not the place to do that. They give you jalapeno corn muffins, some sort of sweet bread, and a white bread. It's awesome. Third, the food. $18 may seem like a lot for a cobb salad but it is very worth it. They did not skimp of any of the toppings and it was fresh and filling. Fourthly, I think the couple sitting next to me was breaking up or in a fight because they both ordered the huge and delicious looking burgers, didn't take any bites, and didn't get a to-go box. It was very sad, not because they were breaking up but because those burgers deserved to be eaten.",

Our group all tried different dinner entrees. The pork was undercooked, the chicken was described as \"it makes my lips burn\", the kale salad was just \"ok\", the steak \"meh\" and the chicken quesadilla had very little chicken and was basically a tortilla with extra hot sauce. Such a disappointment, and I really mean that. I can't even watch Bobby on TV now because I'm embarrassed for him.  Will never return and will recommend all friends NOT waste time and money here. Basically, this place is a tourist trap.",

We made some reservations and came in on a busy Saturday evening for a great meal.   Service was SUPERB. Let me tell you now that this is the best oiled restaurant I've ever seen. Waiters are attentive, tables and cleaned within seconds, and the staff knows the menu inside and out. Our waiter said he had been there for over 5 years - so, that's an amazing testament to how great it must feel to work there as well!  With that said, the food was everything I could ever hope for.  Pork Tenderloin: Great, hearty portions of tender pork. Cooked in bourbon, giving it a great flavor. Tasty ancho chile sauce on the pork. Accompanied by a sweet potato tamale with a pecan butter - amazing! Must try this. It's supposedly one of their signature dishes, so you really can't go wrong with this.  Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops: Smaller portion compared to the tenderloin, but still an amazingly well made dish. Serrano pepper sauce with a mint chimichurri. Comes with a blue corn tamale with basil butter. This complimented the dish really well, although I preferred the tamale that came with the pork tenderloin.   Side of grilled asparagus that wasn't anything special, but complimented the dishes very well.  Give this place a chance and make sure you have reservations beforehand. It's well worth a trip!",

Bread Basket: Several varieties of warm fresh breads. The blue corn jalapeno muffins were a hit with this guy. Asked the waiter to bring more ASAP. Munched heavily on the asiago jalapeno bread as well.  Tiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale: ($18) As the appetizer of the century I was more than happy to have ordered this. Shrimp was cooked lovely and dusted with spicy, sweet flavors. A warm, soft tamale wrapped up lime cilantro & a chipotle aioli. Nicely done sir, nicely done.  Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops: ($42) Decadent, fall off the bone lamb. The serrano chili sauce adds some warmth to the bite, without making you sweat. Not to overpower, a mint chimichurri adds a unique minty jalapeno aroma & character.   I shall return.",

One of the sauces had a little kick but lended a complexity to the flavor.  It was unlike any steak I've ever had before.  If you want a steak but possibly something different, I would highly recommend this place.  I could tasty salty and spicy among other things.  NY strip steak = 5/5 Shrimp & corn tamale appetizer = 5/5 (big enough to share w/ a friend) Roasted corn side = 5/5 (couldn't begin to finish all of it, share a side w/ a friend) Complimentary bread and butter = 5/5 (several kinds of bread) Shell-Off Lobster = 4/5 (I tried my friend's entree and didn't have my own, so this is based on 1 bite really) Service = 5/5  With no microwave at my hotel, I made a point to finish the steak at the expense of leaving some of the other stuff behind.",

If you want to do good food without gorging yourself at a Vegas buffet, consider going to Mesa Grill.  You start with a \"bread\" basket that consists of muffins, corn bread, scones, and various baked goodies. They'll even give you another basket if you ask!  Next come the entrees. And wow, are they deceivingly small. My girlfriend and I ordered from the brunch menu. She got the Scrambled Egg Chilaquiles and I got the Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash. Both dishes looked small, but man when we finished them we had to be rolled out of the restaurant! I liked the Chilaquiles over the Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash. The texture of the chilaquiles was unlike the traditional mexican version that allows some of the chips to soften as it sits in the serving dish. This version was built on large tortilla chips/tostadas with layers of cheese, sauce, and eggs. It had a wonderful crunch that complimented the soft cheese, egg and sauce.  Also, I highly recommend the cactus-pear iced tea. Delicious!!",

    "text": "Mr. Bobby Flay.  I feel I can now feel like you aren't just some TV cook! (sorry...) So Mesa Grill has been at the Caesar's for a while now and I'm always thinking, why would I pay a premium for Mexican food?  I live in LA; I have Mexican food everywhere.  But I see the light now.  It's Mexican/Southwestern fusion-ish food.  I came for lunch on Saturday and even though I made a reservation through Open Table, it wasn't busy.  Apps: Tiger Shrimp & Corn Tamale.  Only one is enough because it is super rich with the sauce but it is oh so good.  The corn was the sweet it needed to bite through all the garlic you taste from the tamale and sauce.  I felt a bit of a kick in the flavor as well.  The tamale was probably the best thing we had.  Entrees: Ranch Style Egg Tostada.  A sizeable scrambled egg atop a fried tortilla with a red chile sauce.  The like how the crunch tostada provided a different texture from the fluffy eggs.  Not very rich so it felt somewhat healthy.  The cheese added a bit of needed fat that I felt was  needed.  Overall a decent dish.  Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash: Sweet potato hash was a bit strange for me.  The hash made it too sweet and the chicken wasn't spicy enough to make it all come together.  The poached egg provided the fat but in the end just an OK dish.  The bread basket included an assortment of breads including the blue cornmeal cornbread muffin.  I thought this was the star of the basket.  So Mr. Bobby Flay.  The meal was pretty good.  Some dishes better than others.  I will definitely be back for the shrimp tamale and I heard there was a shrimp taco special which I wish I got.  As for these brunch dishes, I think I'd prefer coming during another meal time to see what other dishes you have that aren't so \"brunchy\".",

It was creamy, seasoned & simple. The Squash shined. The house made bread was so so scrumptious lots of variety! Then I ordered the lobster tail & masa cake. Flavorful. Perfectly seasoned,  tender & beautifully presented.  My 8 year old had the lobster tacos & loved them. There were 3 teenage boys who all ordered the chicken. They enjoyed it. Especially the potatoes.   I had a few flavored margaritas that were all sweet yet crisp & refreshing.   Our waitress was so nice. The bus boys were really on it & made sure we had everything. Our glasses were never empty. Plates cleared & table crumbed. I loved it!  Great place for a formal dinner!",

    "text": "Bobby Flay, you are my inspiration and my favorite chef! The bold flavors in all of your dishes ceases to always amaze me. I have been here countless times and Mesa Grill still always has something amazing to offer. I rave about this place all the time.   Smoked chicken and black bean quesadilla- Who orders quesadillas at a restaurant? Apparently, I do! This will be the best booty kicking quesadilla ever. The extra thin crispy tortilla smothered with smoked chicken pieces and soft beans. On top of the quesadilla, there was a nice smoked paprika, with some avocado crema to balance the texture out. BAM, this was by far just the perfect way to start off our meal! I mean of course, the bread basket was everything as well.   pork loin sandwich- everything down from the bread, to the soft tender pork loin to even the freshly made fries. The sandwich was everything. The tender pork was so soft and flavorful; it had a nice smoky chipotle flavor to it.   sweet potato hash w/ spicy chicken- Who would have thought sweet potatoes and eggs could mesh? The sweetness from the potatoes, the creaminess from the egg and the  smokiness from the chicken. YUM  Stuffed chile relleno- in an awesome shape of a chile relleno, this dish is stuffed with delicious goodies. Eggplants and some cheese and the whole shabang!  Mesa Grill, you are by far one of my favorite restaurants on my list.",

From the time we walked in and were seated (exactly the time of our 7:00pm reservation!) to the end of our meal, this was a very satisfying experience.   The prices were a little high, but everything is high in Las Vegas!  The restaurant is quite large and on a Wednesday night at 7:00 pm it was almost full.  Our waiter was very delightful and helpful.  He was quick to be able to tell me everything I wanted to know about each entree. He was also very well educated about the different wines by the glass.   I decided on the fish dish and it was amazing.  I wanted to try the chili relleno so bad, but I let my hubby do that.  he gave me a taste and I also wanted my own! After finishing this meal, I wished that we were going to be in Vegas another day so that I could go back again the next day and try something else on the menu.  This was one of my best meals in Vegas.  I highly recommend!",

I'm sure Bobby does it for quality control. My only complaint is our food server, Mike. He was quite rude when I asked for the customize request. Then he never came back to our table again after ordering. Never asked how our meal was. Never asked if we wanted more cocktails. He walked past our table at least 10 times without even glancing at our table. I finally had to Call him over for our bill after waiting almost 15min after we finished our meal. That is when he asked our our meal was. I would completely return but will make sure Mike doesn't serve us. I'm sure Bobby also Wouldn't appreciate the type of Service we received today.",

My partner enjoyed  hers  more then I enjoyed mine.... I will say that  the service we experienced, ( it was not that busy....slow Sunday morning on the strip everywhere) was really really good. Ichobad, ( probably not spelled correctly) was awesome,as  was everyone who took care of us. Actually the service  was 5 Star......very surprised and loved it. The food came out way too fast for me, a normal red flag, but then again it was about 40% full.....so maybe the kitchen was just really on top of things.....I had a Lamb Cobb Salad.....A lot of lamb and bacon, not much of anything else that was listed on the dish. Disappointing. Lived here for 21 years and I'm a bit spoiled......so take what I say with a few grains of salt. ( Smiling) Ciao",

I own all of Bobby's cookbooks, so returning to Mesa has been a priority for me.  I did the prefix menu.  The shrimp and tamale was just amazing.  The flavors were spot on, and they cooked it perfectly.  I also enjoyed my wife's queso fon dito, which was the best cheese dip I've ever had.  For my entree, I had the salmon.  Exquisite.  Some people over season salmon, but Mesa lets it speak for itself.  Chef's preparation was Medium, which is more than I usually cook it, but always listen to the chef because I thought it was perfect.  My wife had the Tuna nachos for an entree.  Also amazing.  Their margaritas are the best.  The cactus pear is most famous, and it is beautiful, but I recommendd the traditional mesa with the smokey floater.   I'll be back again in October and already looking forward to it.",

At the server's suggestion, I had the tiger shrimp tamales, Brussels sprouts, and chocolate sticky toffee pudding (and a margarita, too!). The tamale was good - not great. I was hoping for a punch of some really great flavors, though. Brussels sprouts were inedible - they had not been properly trimmed and I could not even get my teeth through the fibrous stems. The sauce was syrupy and overly sweet. There was nothing bright and fresh about them - just old nasty brussels sprouts covered with a cheap nasty sauce that seemed to have come from aisle 7 of the Piggly Wiggly. But wait, Bob, there's more....Sticky toffee pudding is one of my favorites. It is to be a dense, super moist cake-ish pudding and is made with chopped dates and a brown sugar caramel on top. This was NOT sticky toffee pudding. It was a dry, overly crumby, overly sweet cake. Along side it was to be a vanilla swirl ice cream. Ice cream melts - this did not. Not sure what it was, but it was nasty too. Sorry guys - this should have been a home run of flavor and culinary excellence, but it stunk. And I paid way to much for it.",

This was a quick visit between my bar hopping and other eats this Vegas trip. I told myself I had to stop in here since it's been a year or so since I last visited and I did just for an appetizer. If there's anything I truly enjoyed from my previous visit, it was the sweet potato tamale that came with my pork tenderloin which prompted me to try the tiger shrimp and roasted garlic tamale this time around.  This tamale was very flavorful...a perfect blend of sweet corn and garlic. The tiger shrimp were a nice size as well as delicious. $18 well spent for a quick snack and worth it.  If there's one thing I can say about Mr. Flay, he knows how to make some damn good tamales with any spin he throws on them. My taste buds love it which means this will most likely draw me back in for another visit.  Snack 12/12/2015",

I'm a big fan of Bobby Flay and love coming here for his food and drinks!  Selection and the quality of the food is great! Portions are very small, but the quality covers the small portion and relatively expensive prices you have to pay. Food is seasoned perfectly and goes along very well with the margaritas offered here. So far my favorite is the tiger shrimp tamale! *4 stars for the food.  Service here is good, however the servers can abandon you at times which could make the experience disappointing. I remember I had to wait a while for my waiter to come back for me to order food after having some margaritas. Refills of water weren't offered and it took some time for the check to come out. Hopefully it's just me being unlucky in this aspect of the experience. *2 stars for the service.  Atmosphere here is amazing. I really like how the restaurant is designed! *5 stars for the atmosphere.  Mesa Grill is located near the roulette tables that I like to gamble at so I notice that I tend to come here after a heater. Very good place to hang out with friends or with your date!",

    "text": "Mesa Grill is AWESOME - especially for brunch.  Tried Mesa Grill years ago with my girlfriends and had to bring hubby here and he's so happy we came here on our trip...  They started us off with their \"bread basket\" which had a variety of breads.  While I know we should have saved room for our brunch, we ended up eating the whole bread basket and had more!!!  Our favorite was the scones and coffee cake.. Was hard NOT to eat these!  And the server was SO NICE to provide us with only our favorites the 2nd go around!! YUM....  We then got Bobby Flay's specialty, The prawns over a homemade corn tamale! LOVED it - we pretty much licked the plate clean!  If you get a chance - go on their website - they show how they make it and it's a MUST order when you come here...  I also got their apple salad which because of it's simplicity was so tasty!  That dressing was perfect with the salad - can't recall what it was other than we basically inhaled the entire salad.  And I enjoyed it with my prickly pear tea! They gave me simple syrup so I can add the right amount of sweetness! Loved it!!  Hubby had their sweet potato hash and LOVED it.  Cooked perfectly - but because we ate so much bread - he could only eat one, so we brought the other back to our timeshare which luckily had a kitchen so we could heat it up and devour the next day and it was JUST as yummy!  I had Egg over Taquillas.  Who knew such a simple dish could be SO GOOD! The egg was so light and fluffy - on top of cheese and they smeared a little seasoned black bean paste between the toasted crispy taquillas. Flavors and textures partying in my mouth!! I'm drooling now just thinking about this dish!  So simple and so delicious!  We were SO STUFFED - we definitely felt like we had to roll out of there - thank goodness in Vegas it's all about walking!  And the server was so nice - they gave me a \"to go\" cup for my prickly pear tea and topped it for me so I got to sip it as we walked around Vegas.  The servers are so personable and attentive - it was a nice welcoming feeling...  Will definitely come back - and maybe try lunch or dinner next time!   Thank you Bobby Flay!!  You definitely are the best when it comes to southwest cuisine!!",

    "text": "This place was amazing! I watch Bobby Flay on TV alot and never understood why all his TV shows were about \"beating him.\" It seemed a bit narcissistic to me, but after eating at Mesa Grill...I believe it!!!!   I ordered the salmon for lunch and it was so very tasty. My fiance had the lamb salad, which was also tasty, but the fish made my day. We also had the appetizer, the goat cheese dip, which was a bit too oily for me, but still tasted good once we drained the oil.  Price wise...Expensive! But you get what you pay for and they give you free bread and good service (wipe bread crumbs off the table for you). I would go back again the next time we have a special occasion. We went for my fiance birthday. They should add free dessert or something for celebrations. Then that would've made his Mesa Grill even better.  Def. Recommend this place.",

    "text": "My family and I came here to eat dinner and we didn't expect what we thought it was. We expected it to be worth our money for how pricey their entrees are. We were looking forward to try out their burgers because we heard a lot of positive comments on it but it turns out the burgers were on the lunch menu and not their dinner menu therefore we were a little bummed out. Their menu is limited, did not offer much selections. Their portions were really small for its price but was still tasty. They have side dish options but cost $10. The side dishes do not come with the entree they our separate. This is why the price is too high for what it delivers. On a positive note, they did have good bread served before our main dishes arrived and  their service is great. Our server was very informative what the day specials are and if there were any changes to the menu. They have very clean bathrooms, and also display multiple Bobby Flay magazine covers which is interesting to look at when you're waiting for someone to finish up in the bathroom.",

We were seated promptly, and our waiter came and took our drink orders. After that, a bread basket came out pretty quickly- all the breads were delicious!  Because we were starving, we cleaned out the breads before our food came out.   For appetizers, we ordered the shrimp with roasted garlic corn tamale, as well as the blue corn pancake with barbecued duck. Both were delicious!    For entrees, I had fish, and my bf had the pork tenderloin. We also ordered sides of corn (omg!!) and baked potato. We were both very happy with our entrees, but between the two, I think I enjoyed my bf's pork tenderloin a tad more.  And if we come back, I'm definitely getting the corn again!  All in all, it was a great meal!  Check it out- you won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "***Review is for BRUNCH only  To get it out of the way...I'm not the biggest Bobby Flay fan.  On TV, he can come off as obnoxious, arrogant, and cocky.  However, the guy shows up on a bunch of different shows, which makes me wonder...is it just a persona he puts up?  I mean, he must be a decent guy to get himself on so many spots on the Food Network, right?  If it is just an act though, it works; his brash personality actually made me want to try his cooking even more, just so I could see if he's as good as his reputation suggests.  And being that the MESA in NY was his first restaurant, my friends and I figured this would the perfect chance to check out his cooking.    Unfortunately, we couldn't squeeze MESA in for dinner, so we had to settle for fitting it in for brunch instead.  When our party of ten checked in with the hostess, we were seated promptly, where the wait staff was quick to start serving our table.  Our waiter was helpful with menu suggestions, and was pretty good at describing and explaining the different components of each plate.  In fact, when it was all said and done, I ended up going with one of his suggestions - the Scrambled Eggs Chilaquiles along with the Rough Cut Tuna Nachos that a few of my friends wanted to split.  - The Rough Cut Tuna Nachos - served with a mango & habanero hot sauce and avocado crema...terrific.  The tuna is similar to Hawaiian poke, but with Southwestern flavors instead.  In a way, with the crema, it's reminiscent of a guacamole salsa, but better.  Much better.  Too bad there aren't any places around here that serve it the same way.  - Scrambled Eggs Chilaquiles - served with a roasted tomatillo sauce, white cheddar cheese, and creme fraiche.  Presentation wise, all of the colors on the plate really made it stand out (blue corn tortilla, orange sauce, white cheddar, green seasoning), but the execution is what really made the dish.  With three layers of crispy tortilla, it had a nice crunch, which worked well with the richness.  The combination of flavors were fantastic.  If anything, I wish there was more of a kick with the sauce, but it tasted great as is.  In addition, I also got a chance to try my friend's Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash, but I thought my entree was better.  Although I did like the spiciness and flavor, I would have like a little contrast in the texture.  Along with our meal, they also served a basket of bread, all with some Southwestern twists.  They were all decent, but my favorite of the bunch was the jalapeno bread.    In the end, I'll give Flay his due...the guy can offer up a pretty good brunch menu.  The ones that I tried were great, though I know a few of my friends were not as enthralled with their orders (hence the four stars).  None of them said the dishes were bad though, so maybe it was just a case of hopeful expectations not being met.  Reviews on here are pretty high for dinner as well, so I'd be interested in checking that out next time.  At least now, I have another reason to go back to Vegas...not that I really needed another one anyways.",

We wanted to have a nice dinner for our short trip to Vegas and this was definitely worth it. It's southwestern cuisine so we were warned that the food had a spicy kick to it. We grew up on authentic homemade Mexican food so we know a thing or 2 about spiciness. Anyway, we ended up ordering lobster tacos as our app. It's 3 miniature tacos. Very tasty but tiny. For drinks, we ordered the white peach margarita per our waitress's recommendation. I typically like my margaritas original (with limon) but this was good. For our main entree I ordered the Grilled Mahi Mahi and my bf ordered the Salmon. We were both very satisfied. They also offer 3 different types of bread - all good - my favorite has to be the jalapeno bread though. I didn't find our dishes to be spicy at all but they were very well executed. It made for a wonderful dinner and if ever back in town this is definitely a restaurant I'd consider visiting again.",

I had the cactus pear margarita, shrimp and corn tamale, Coffee Rubbed Filet Mignon and Trio Of Sorbet.   The shrimp and corn tamales was me given a shot at faith. I had always disliked tamales because of some certain flavor that I always tasted, but I gave it a shot with the limited selection of restaurant week. It was AMAZING. The corn tamale was creamy and more corn flavored than anything. The shrimps were juicy and chewy.  The next is the coffee rubbed filet mignon. I don't normally use all capital, but this dish deserve all capital. It was DELICIOUS!! The filet mignon is cooked to perfection. Even though the chef slice is through the middle making it like sandwich for some weird reason. Never had it served that way. I'm still savoring the taste. A definitely must order there.  The trio of sorbet consisted of cactus, coconut and mango. I was expecting a more slushie texture sorbet like it usually is. I was pleasantly surprised that it was thick and creamy. When I was eating the mango, I was overwhelmed with spiciness. Apparently it was mango with cayenne pepper. Immediately eating the coconut after definitely soothes it. Give it a try!",

    "text": "You definitely have plenty of choices to dine at while in Vegas but if you're looking for something solid, you should start walking directly to Ceasar's Palace towards Mesa Grill.   You'll enter a contemporary tex-mex restaraunt that boasts vivid colors which will quickly excite you for what your about to view - the menu.   If you're a first-timer, you'll want to know that the menu doesn't entirely describe the dishes....but don't despair! The wait staff is super friendly and will point out some of the customer favorites and of course, their special of the day.   We went for brunch, and boy, did they have a nice selection. Debating between many of the dishes, the choices finally came down to the Goat Cheese \"Queso Fondido\" and the Yucatan style grouper.   While we were waiting for our food, we were brought some brunchy type breads...and by brunchy type, it's not your typical breads that you would get, but we got a chocolate chip coffee cake, jalapeno corn bread and a cranberry scone. Yum!!   Next, we received the Goat Cheese \"Queso Fondido\" which was the perfect blend of creamy cheeses, topped with roasted peppers and served along side of some blue corn tortilla strips. The right size to split between a few people too.   Finally, the long and awaited Yucatan Style Grouper, it was a citrus flavored grouper which was grilled (of course), atop a blue crab succotash with fava beans and corn. Somehow I can still taste the chives in the succotash tying the whole dish together.   I'll be coming back....I'm already planning my next order for my return :)",

First off, the service was impeccable - the wait staff was extremely attentive, and our waitress knew the menu very well. She was well versed in the gluten free items on the menu (almost the entire menu, besides a few things were gf) - she answered all the questions that my sister-in-law who has food allergies asked without hesitation. The ambiance was wonderful, it wasn't too loud, and as a party of 7 we were sat in a rounded table, which made it possible for all of us to communicate. As for the food, every item that came to our table was INCREDIBLE! There was not one item that wasn't full of flavor or perfectly cooked. Highly recommend this place if you are in Vegas!",

    "text": "Let me preface this review by saying I have been waiting to try this place out for awhile. I'm already a fan of Bobby Flay who seems to be on everything on Food Network nowadays. The stars and reviews built up my excitement...and then I heard from friends of friends that it sucked. I was a little scared that it really would suck and I'd curse Bobby Flay with every ounce of my being (like when I tried to come here on my last trip and they closed early to redo the floors).  Better half and I arrived here for brunch over Memorial Day weekend. We had our reservations about how much I'd like the place seeing as how I die if I lick a hot cheeto. Lots of things say spicy this...spicy that..spicy everything. In my head, I tell myself to toughen up and just try it...then I wimped out and went with a blue corn waffle. I ordered a cactus pear iced tea along with it since I was a bit curious. Boyfriend ordered spicy scrambled eggs sans goat cheese. The waiter gave him a bit of grief over it..saying he would check with the chef if that was allowed..asking if he didn't like it or if he was allergic...yada yada.   Our plates came out and the waffle is the size of my face. Actually, bigger. It comes with vanilla creme fraiche and blackberry bourbon syrup. I'm not a fan of blackberries but this was divine! All the flavors melded together wonderfully. It wasn't overly sweet and the waffle had a distinct flavor. I tried (and failed) to finish the whole thing but only ate 3/4s of it. They prepared the eggs to bf's liking, without cheese, and he said it was delicious! I looked over at his plate and it was quite green from the onions and pleeenty of jalapeno. I didn't even attempt a bite. The tea was quite refreshing. It had a light flavor that contrasts how bitter tea can get. No need for sweetener here.  Overall a pleasant experience. It didn't disappoint and I don't have to curse Bobby Flay every time I see him on Food Network. A nice change for brunch with its southwestern flare. It was definitely worth the wait!",

    "text": "The famous Mesa Grill, owned by chef Bobby Flay (one of my favorite TV personality chefs) is located inside Caesars Palace. Make a reservation its hard to get it (we did).  The decor was kind of lounge like, not what I would call romantic but not bar and grill like. Just a relaxed upscale lounge, a bit of noise from a large room with a good number of people. We were seated to close to other couples and a large party, its my only real knock on the place, give us a few more inches between tables (its literally about 8 inches).  The wait staff was great, different waiters for different function. The main waiter knew the menu, was able to make recommendations and assisted us with our selections very well. I would say the service was some of the best I have had.   We had the usual appetizer and meal, I had the classic Mesa Ribeye and my WIfe had Lamb chops. Bother were cooked expertly and seasoned well. I would honestly say that hers was better than mine, but beef can be boring when sat next to well prepared lamb (according to my taste).  The appetizer, drinks, and dessert was a reasonable bill for a very nice meal.   I would say overall one of the better meals I have had at a high end place, so often you pay piles of cash for pretense and marketing. At Mesa you get great service, good food, and ample amounts. It is really a bargain.",

Shrimp was very succulent and loved the mango habanero sauce and tomatillo sauce. Swordfish was perfectly cooked. Oh, the bread basket was good.  Food is consistent. One downside for the Vegas location is that it's located inside Caesars' palace casino. So, the restaurant had lingering cigarette smoking smell.",

    "text": "As soon as we were seated our server came over and was among the friendliest servers we've ever encountered. He was instantly like an old friend. The waiter explained that the house tequilas were all 100% blue agave, so I ordered a house margarita. I will say hands down that it was the best margarita I've ever had (and I have had a lot of them!!) We were served jalapeno cornbread that my husband really loved but I found too crumbly.   We ordered the crispy squid appetizer and it definitely lived up to the description. The dish was simply calamari, but they aren't joking that it is crispy. I was just slightly disappointed that the menu wasn't the same as the menu posted outside the restaurant. I was really looking forward to that roasted corn soup they advertised!  For our main entrees we both had trouble deciding so we asked our server for guidance and he was very helpful. I had the green chile cioppino and the husband had the pork loin. The green chile cioppino was heavenly and I was so sad I didn't get more broth! I wanted to lick the bowl clean. I wish the cioppino was served with rice instead of a chunk of unsavory cornbread in the bowl, but other than that I was very happy with this dish. I was not a fan of the pork loin because it was crusted with something that tasted very strong and spicy and I didn't get any pork flavor. However, my husband looked like he was in a state of bliss so I let him eat as much as he wanted. We were very tipsy at this point so we decided to skip dessert and hit the tables.   I would highly recommend this place to anyone but its probably best if you like bold and spicy flavors. We had others who were on dates around us but also many large groups of friends and right next to us there was a big group of drunk, rowdy businessmen. This place is loud and open so its not a good place for people who desire a quiet, intimate atmosphere.  The servers here really know how to deliver service. When I stood up to use the restroom I asked a server where it was. He walked me halfway to the front so I could see it before he pointed it out to me. In addition, if you walk by any servers they immediately give you a wide berth as though you are some sort of royalty. I also like it when I leave the table and return to find that the server has folded my napkin. To me, that's the mark of truly excellent table service.",

The Serrano corn muffins, Jalepeno cheese bread, Goat Cheese Queso Fundito, Cornmeal crusted chile relleno, Lamb porterhouse (the sauce was heaven), and Churros were flawless.  If there is a negative, it was the reservation policy (through Ceasar's concierge which is listed on the MESA website).  When I called for a party of two I was told a $50 no-show fee would be charged to my credit card unless I cancelled before 3 p.m.  As I was driving in from L.A. and not leaving until noon, I was a bit aprehensive.  They did give me the direct number to change the reservation if needed.  Imagine my surprise when, upon entering the restaurant, I saw over half the tables empty.  Granted it was Tuesday at 9 p.m., but the reservation penalty seemed a bit harsh.  Unless it is a weekend or holiday, just plan on walking in.",

I don't know if he was joking or serious about the entrees being pre- made and frozen, but it was disappointing to hear.  Maybe that's why the food hasn't really tasted as good as it did years ago.

    "text": "I sit on the fence with this one.  Sometimes the restaurant lives up to the hype (especially for celebrity owned restaurants), but sometimes it falls a bit flat.  This is one of those that parts were absolutely outstanding, while other parts...whaaaaa?  The start wasn't so great.  Granted, we went without reservations, so I take that into account.  We were told to come back at 9:45 when we got there at 9:15.  We did so, but still waited another 20 minutes.  The hostess was nice enough, but there were three hostesses, and it seemed like only one was really working.  The other two just looked upon the first to do the work.  However, they were all very nice.  Ok, we sit down and looked over the menus.  They had Duvel offered, and the pour was perfect.  This isn't always done with Duvel, so kudos for getting that down pat.    They brought corn bread that came in various forms (one was done with blue corn meal), and that was wonderful, along with the homemade breads.    I ordered the chili rubbed bone-in rib-eye medium rare to rare, and it was cooked perfectly.  My wife got the rabbit with spinach instead of the risotto, and it was cooked perfectly.  Our friend simply ordered a salad and had some of our meals (I shouldn't be eating 22 oz of rib-eye).  While it was all cooked very nicely, the spices were a bit weak, which was a disappointment.  Bobby Flay is known for his spices, and they simply didn't really come through.    I must say that the service was some of the best I have ever received.  The waiter has been working there for six years, and it shows.  The entire waitstaff was absolutely wonderful, and that is the main reason for the 4 stars.  I can't stress enough that the service was simply impeccable.  It may have been the best service I have ever received at a restaurant.  What keeps it from being five stars was the cost of the meal (expected, but still a bit high for what was presented), and the lack of spiciness.  This is a good restaurant, but with so many options in Vegas, it may be a while before I go back, as there are many others that I would like to try first. If you have some time, check the place out, especially if you are near the center part of the strip.",

Almost everything on the menu has a bite to (except for the smoked salmon). Some dishes are spicy, some are not... It's really not all that spicy. I particularly liked the grits. It was sooo creamy. I don't want to know how many calories is in it, but then again, who can resist butter and cream?  I ordered the lamb salad... I LOVE lamb. The spices rubbed on the lamb reminds me a lot of the spices from Northern China... Really yummy... the goat cheese sprinkled on the salad was a bit too powerful. The salad in itself was good. The greens were not swimming in dressing.  Between my friends and I we ordered 5 different dishes... one being a burger, which was very tasty...The bread bowl was really good...If only I could have ate bread all day... we had a variety of salty bisques and muffin like breads. They were delicious.  Service: Our initial server was VERY GOOD explaining to us the menu and Bobby Flay's cooking style... then suddenly they switched servers on us... he wasn't as good at answering some of our questions because many of my friends don't know who Bobby Flay is nor have they tried Southern style cuisine before.  I'd love to go back to try other dishes. It's a great place for groups. We were lucky to get a booth that sat us quite comfortably.

My husband & I really didn't need anytime because we already knew what we wanted. It took our server at least 10 minutes to return for even just our drink order. We decided to order our food as well. Another 15 minutes go by & sure enough our food & drinks come out at exactly the same time. Let me also mention that 2 double bloody Mary's will be charged as if you ordered 4 bloodys Mary's which is a complete rip off. Our server was obviously overwhelmed as tables around us were having to flag him down as well as bussers passing by. It's really unfortunate that the service is so crappy. Especially for the money spent & how much my husband and I look forward to coming here.",

They must cook in a volcano, because the steak had a nice crust with the middle just barely warm ...22oz of awesomeness is what that was. The meat was tender and every bite wasn't saying \"beef\", it was screaming with neon signs..that is an awesome steak, my hat off to you Mr. Flay. We ask the waiter if the mashed potatoes (with a green chile white cheese sauce) could be shared, he said yes... no you can't share it..for one, it's a small side and 2 its too goo to share..you will want that bad boy all by yourself. I also had the roasted corn soup, my only complaint is that it's too small. It has a smoke chile flavor (not spicy) that balances well with the sweetness of cream. I've normally avoided \"celebrity chef\" restaurants in the past, thinking it was all hype. Mesa Grill changed that for me. The 3 items above plus 2 jack and coke came up to $128... not cheap by any stretch, but well worth the flavor explosion.",

    "text": "Loved it.  We went with another couple for dinner on a Saturday night.  We made reservations.. The service was top notch.  I usually am the one at the table that finishes her water and then waits...for more.  I never had more than two sips out of my glass before it was full again.  It was awesome.  The waitress was outstanding.    Now the food. They brought a basket of bread and let me tell you I was in heaven.  There was a raisin nut bread, a jalapeno bread and corn muffins.  They were so good we asked for another basket and finished it.   My husband and I had margaritas, me peach, him the special agave nectar one.  They were good.  We had the TIGER SHRIMP+ ROASTED GARLIC CORN TAMALE which was fine.  I didn't like the tamale much but the shrimp and sauce were wonderful.  Next I had the GRILLED LAMB PORTERHOUSE CHOPS which were out of this world good.  I ate all of them save for the bites I gave around the table and it was a big portion...the tamale that came with it \"meh\" not so good but who had room for it.  My husband had the MANGO + SPICE CRUSTED TUNA STEAK and it was delicious too, not as good as my lamb but still really good.  Our friend had the black bean soup - which was delicious and he also had the taco dish which I can't find on their online menu but he didn't think much of it.  Our other friend had the chicken dish which is also not on the online menu and it was ok...it was chicken.    We finished dinner off with the TOASTED COCONUT LAYER CAKE and it was so good I am now ruined for all coconut cake.  It had a coconut cream over the top of it and the layers were moist with I think a simple syrup.  It was so good.  I want to go again as soon as possible.",

    "text": "I had really been looking forward to eating here and scheduled my birthday lunch here while we were in Vegas.  There were 4 of us and we were seated immediately for our 1pm reservation. I ordered a white peach margarita and it was delicious ($13). My husband got the margarita with the agave nectar in it and liked that as well ($16). I'd been studying the online menu for weeks and knew already that I was going to order the spicy chicken with sweet potato hash.   The bread was really nice. I liked the cheddar and jalapeno best. It was spicy and yummy.  We ordered the queso fundido to start. It was several cheeses (including goat!) with peppers and blue corn chips. YUMOLA!!!! This was delicious.  Our entrees arrived and I cut into my poached egg and was unhappy to see the white was runny and gooey. That's not how a poached egg is supposed to be. A solid white, runny yolk is the norm. The hash was delicious, but some of the sweet potatoes were crunchy, not tender. They were clearly undercooked. My husband got the pork tenderloin sandwich and we were surprised to see it came cold.  I took a bit and did not like it, but he said he did. Our 2 other companions enjoyed their Mesa Burgers.  I sent my dish back and waited about 15 minutes for a new one. A manager brought over the new one and apologized for the mistake. I cut into my poached egg once again and the white was solid - yay!  But the yolk was completely solid too - boo!  Why can't this place cook a poached egg correctly? I can do it and I can't cook worth shite.  So, the manager came back to ask how it was and I told him I've been waiting months to come here and I'm pretty unhappy with the way this dish came out. So he said he was sorry once again and said he would remove it from the bill. Nice, but not what I wanted for my birthday lunch.  Even though it was my birthday, they didn't offer us a gratis dessert. We looked at the menu and nothing really stood out, so we passed.  Disappointed overall, but parts of the meal were good enough for 3 stars.",

    "text": "Making a reservation here was a HUGE mistake. We were in Vegas to celebrate a friend's birthday.The night started off great - good drinks - nice server - and a tasty looking menu. We ordered some apps for the table, and each got entrees, which we agreed they were average at best. I'd spoke to the server about a birthday dessert for my friend - which took too long to arrive. Things started to get sketchy. My friend slipped a different server a credit card part way through the meal to ensure our birthday friend would not pay. Upon finishing dessert, we expected to receive the bill and credit card, as it was late and there was only 1 other table. After bringing the $900+ bill, it was missing the credit card, and we had to ask them to go find it. My friend grew increasingly nervous, as her credit card had been in the back for over 30 minutes. Once the card was returned, the server very unprofessionally complained to the nearby table about how we were unhappy with the missing card - we called him out and he rolled his eyes. As the other table prepared to leave, so did we. Here's when things got WAY WORSE. Once we were officially the only people in the restaurant besides the staff, we gathered our things and headed towards the door. As the door closed behind us, I realized that I left my phone at the table. I walked directly back there, no more than 60 seconds after leaving, the linens and table were being cleared, but my phone was suspiciously missing. I rechecked all of my pockets and emptied my purse and then asked my friends to call my phone in hopes of locating it. It rang all the way to voicemail but could not be heard anywhere in the empty restaurant. I know that my phone was most recently at the table because a friend has a photo of me with my phone at 11:18pm taking birthday pictures. I never left the table between then and when we got up to leave at 11:48 pm. My anxiety increased. The server who had misplaced the credit card insisted that I had gone to the bathroom and possibly left it there where someone else likely took it. That's totally unTrue, which I insisted. The hostess insisted that she hadn't seen my phone.  At this point I verbally said \"I will use find my iPhone\". There were 3 employees (2 men, 1 woman) in street clothes at the bar - clearly done working. As I passed them starting to login to the 'find my iPhone' app, one of the men said 'OK we gotta bounce'. I started to panic but didn't want to cast judgment. Could they have actually stolen my phone? Approximately 30 seconds after they left the restaurant, I'd logged into Find my iPhone, only to see that my phone was 'offline'. My friend called my phone again - it had been shut off and going straight to voicemail. Strange, because I had at least 70% battery before dinner. At this point I became furious, and felt helpless. I demanded to speak to the manager on duty. The manager strolled out and I quickly informed him of the situation. Confused, he asked, \"why would anyone steal your iPhone? They can't do anything with it.\" Are you f-ing kidding me?! Shocked, I questioned him about the 3 employees that just left a minute ago. He rudely responded, \"I don't know, I have a lot of employees. I'd have to look at a schedule.\" I refuted, \"what kind of manager doesn't know the people on his floor? One of your employees clearly just stole my phone and you are standing here not trying to help me at all. This is f-ing absurd. I want to go to security and see surveillance videos.\" He unwillingly took me to security, but never questioned any of his employees if they had my phone. Dealing with security was an even bigger headache. A young, extremely rude kid was rolling his eyes and smirking as we attempted to file a report and obtain information on what the next steps were to actively locate my phone before it was too late. We requested the head of security - finally someone who showed some customer service and actually listened to us. He assured us they would investigate that night and watch the surveillance videos and agreed it seemed like my phone had been stolen. He also apologized for his colleagues behavior and said someone would lose their job over this. 90 minutes later, I realized the only choice now was to leave, without my phone, and that it was gone. I know it is just a phone that can be replaced but I felt violated and taken advantage of, which is why I decided to write this review. This was the worst restaurant experience I have ever had! I understand everyone makes mistakes, but it is how you handle the situation that I believe is the most important, because that will determine the lasting impression. Unfortunately for Mesa Grill and Caesar's Palace, they made a very large mistake, and failed to handle the situation with any respect, integrity, or professionalism. Therefore myself, and the 9 other people that witnessed this atrocity will never go back to the hotel or any associated restaurants, and I highly recommend you don't either.",

Friday night and the place is hopping .  6 of us without a reservation manage to squeeze in at 9:30 .    started with the high end nachos, the quesidilla, some decent but naturally, over-priced margaritas.  The entrees included, pork loan ( decent ) salmon ( boring ) coffee - chili crusted filet ( excellent ) and duck ( way over sauced ) had brussel sprouts, spinach,  tamales for sides - the brussel sprouts were a hit.  a bottle of pinot noir that did so little i'll be damned if i know the name.  desserts included apple pie ( boring ) , chocolate cornbread pudding ( decent )  chili/brownie cheesecake ( ok )  and the churros with chocolate dipping sauce ( way too much sugar coating the churro )   Overall, it was a decent meal - total cost including tip came to $620.  ok pricing.  I doubt i'll re-visit Mesa Grill unless out-of-towners insist.  pics added",

    "text": "Wanted to try this place the last time I came to Vegas but then we missed our reservation time and therefore didn't get to try so we thought eh why not try it this time. And so we did. Now my parents aren't really big fan of American style restaurants like these and I think that this place didn't change their minds about it.   First of all the service was okay...our waitress seem a little preoccupied or rather annoyed with us taking our time.....so I didn't feel like her service was all that great but it wasn't all that terrible either....I would like to think that she probably just had a long day and was really tired.....so I will let that go.   Both my parents ordered the Pumpkin Soup and I didn't like pumpkin but that was the only soup they were serving so I didn't get a starter. My bf tried their Blue Corn Pancake with bbq duck....it was really meant for one serving...actually after seeing that I realized all the appetizers were made for one serving....bf said it the duck meat was overloaded with Hoisin sauce so it was pretty sweet. I didn't know that the appetizers were going to be so small because I didn't really want to eat that much so I ordered the Blue Corn Lobster Taco as an entree....turns out it was three bite sized tacos....it was good but for the price it was just not worth it.  I ordered the Veal chop for my mom and the Green Chile  Cioppino for my dad. I guess he really didn't like the flavor because he only ate the one jumbo prawn and the scallops but not the Bass, Clams or the Mussels. He said the fish had a weird texture and the flavor was weird. My mom liked the veal chop...I tried a piece of it and it was indeed very tender and flavorful. We had a side dish of spinach - $9 dollars for a small bowl even though it was meant to be shared.....ehhh not worth it. My bf apparent enjoyed his Mango Spiced Rubbed Tuna Steak....it did look pretty good and I tried a piece of that too and I guess it was pretty good.   The bill came out to be around 250ish plus tip....I was expecting a three digit bill however I didn't expect it to be in the 200's.....the quality and quantity of the food was just not worth that amount of money and I don't really think I would come back. I wasn't really satisfied with the food or service and quite frankly I left still hungry. My parents weren't impressed either and I think they were still hungry too but just didn't say anything to me....=/",

On the menu it is described as \"coffee rubbed\" and the only thing I can think of that would taste worse than coffee is a filet ruined by being rubbed with it. The chef was accomodating and they made the filet without the coffee rub for me. I assumed they would add some other delicious spices and maybe a sauce to take the place of the \"rub\", but it was very basic and just a tad dry.  Was it good? Yes. Have I had better? Yes. My advice would be to look at the menu in advance and make sure the selections appeal to you, since it's a Tex-Mex/Mexican kind of place. All in all, a decent meal with good service.",

We were feeling brave so we had our waiter Kent surprise us with two margaritas, two appetizers, and two meals. As crazy as this may sound, Kent already won our trust over by introducing himself and having a conversation with us at the bar prior to the restaurant opening.  I'm not going to attempt to describe the dishes we got because It would be a disservice to the chef, but they were all GREAT. The appetizers Kent ordered for us were the tiger shrimp roasted corn tamale and the blue corn pancake. The tiger shrimp was the favorite of the two, but i feel that's more of a personal taste preference than anything because the Blu corn pancake was killer too! The entrees consisted of the New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin and the grilled lamb porterhouse cops. Both were seasoned to perfection and complimented with the perfect sauces. If you're looking for a nice dinner to compliment your Vegas experience you can't go wrong coming here. Ask for Kent and if you have an open mind and an empty stomach have him order for you  :)",

I had a bean salad and the chile relleno. The salad was very good, had some crunchiness to it.  Loved it!  The chile relleno was the best I've had.  Ever. Stuffed with manchego cheese, and with a crunchy cornmeal crust. And like, a sauce that was ridiculous and wonderful at the same time.  Our waitress was so good: great suggestions, very professional, and personable too. My friends had steak medium rare and loved it, and the fish (she said that it wasn't anything to writer home about).   Ambience was great, prices only a little steep for what we got. Oh, I almost forgot, the bread basket was SO good. Eat here!  You will not regret it!",

    "text": "Best piece of advice for dining at Mesa Grill: Order something non-bread related and non-carbalicious. After downing the uber amazing bread basket that is served pre-meal, you'll wish you had.  First of all, the bread basket was the best bread basket I've ever been served. It consisted of blue corn muffins, jalapeno corn bread, blueberry coffee cake, mini scones, and the most perfectly softened butter that you ever did see. I had to try halfs of each type of bread, and they were all perfectly warm bunches of little goodness.  I think the restaurant is a great brunch spot (which is the meal that we were dining here for). The menu consisted of a little bit of everything for all breakfast/lunch palettes. I chose to go with the scrambeled eggs chilaquiles for my main course. Boy, it was heavy, rich, and just superb! The flavors blended perfectly well with the eggs, the fried tortilla on the bottom, the cheese, and the creme fraiche topping. The roasted tomatillo sauce could've had a bit more heat to it, but nonetheless, it was still a great compliment to the dish.  I also tried bits of my friend's dishes. The tomato soup with blue corn tortillas was actually surprisingly good (given that I'm not much of a tomato fan). The blue corn buttermilk waffle was heavenly. A bit too much creme fraiche was piled on top, but once removed, the waffle was crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and just a melt in your mouth piece of heaven.  This is the second Bobby Flay restaurant I've tried (Bar Americain being the first), and he does not continue to disappoint. Really amazing food! I'd recommend this place to everyone!",

They bring by an assortment of bread instead of chips--cornbread muffins, jalapeno cheese bread and a raisin bread.   For food, I had the shrimp tacos. It comes with six smoked shrimp and two tortillas with some small sides of mango salsa, salsa verde (so good) and guacamole. The portion size seemed a bit off for the price of $25. I'm not complaining though, because it was so good. We also ordered the pork tenderloin sandwich with fries. It was tasty and sizable, but nothing to write home about.

That is one of the perks of eating at a restaurant owned by one of the more well-known chefs in the country... they always have knowledgeable, informed, and helpful staff.   To start, they give you homemade corn muffins made with yellow and blue cornmeal. These were very tasty! I can't remember the rest of the bread basket contents, but the corn muffins really stood out.   For an appetizer, I ordered the gala apple salad. If I came for lunch I would probably order this as my meal... delicious. Great combination of flavors, and I especially loved the combination of toasted pecans with spicy orange vinaigrette!  Sadly for me, the restaurant only has 1 vegetarian entree option. But that is probably more than most places. It was the cornmeal crusted chile relleno. Normally more cheese than I would order for a meal, but it was a good choice. The chili is stuffed with manchego cheese and red peppers which was a real delight. Very flavorful, definitely not your average dish from a Mexican restaurant! It was very rich, and I was already pretty full from my salad so I took most of it back to the hotel. Yummy, and not a bad option for vegetarians, but sometimes I wish restaurants had less cheesy options as well.   For dessert, our table of 4 split the banana cream pie and sticky toffee pudding. Although I had no complaints about the banana cream pie, the sticky toffee pudding was really my favorite. It was to die for!!   With dessert, our waiter recommended something called \"tequila crema\" that is apparently one of Bobby Flay's specials. YUM! Ask for this if you get a chance. It is a sweet, creamy, spicy dessert drink that we all loved. Overall, a great experience here!",

    "text": "We were planning to go for dinner but couldn't get a reservation until after 9pm so we decided to go ahead try it out for lunch. We were seated quickly and our waiter greeted us very warmly!   We started off with some delicious margaritas and were given a nice little basket of mixed breads. My favorite was the blueberry coffeecake! I could really go for a lifetime supply of it. I am not a big fan of coffeecake as well. When the waiter was describing each type of bread, I kind of dismissed the coffeecake until I tried it!   The atmosphere was great. We ordered the goat cheese \"queso fundido\" as an appetizer which I highly recommend. Then we decided to order the rough cut tuna \"nachos\" and spicy scrambled eggs for our entrees. The tuna \"nachos\" are a pretty small portion and I probably wouldn't order them again. The spicy scrambled eggs had jalapeno and goat cheese apricot but it was a bit too cheesy for me. I think it's because we had the fundido for appetizer. If you love cheese, you'll be VERY happy!  We found something inedible in our potatoes and our waiter quickly took it away and replaced it. Then, the chef offered us a dessert on the house. We couldn't have been more pleased. We decided on the toasted coconut layered cake and it was AMAZING!!! We were so happy that they offered us a dessert to make up for the mistake. We ordered the best item on the menu! If you go there, be sure to have the toasted coconut layered cake. You will not regret it.  Overall, I had a great experience here. I would try other items next time and thought the service was wonderful! We will definitely be back.",

Our Appetizer was Blue Corn Lobster Taco (5 stars) Chunks of tasty lobster and crunchy taco shells  Chipotle Glazed Rib Eye (5 stars) I'm salivating just thinking about this dish. Charred and crispy on the outside and so juicy in the middle. (PERFECT) A genius dish!. I can't say enough good things about this dish. Generous portion too.   Black Angus New York strip steak (4 3/4 stars) My GF's dish. I think my taste bud was spoiled by my Chipotle Glazed Rib Eye.   For dessert our waiter recommended the Deep Dish Banana cream pie (3 stars) May be they had a off night preparing this dish. But I don't care..my rib eye was sooo good that no other meal can spoil my dining experience here.   I wonder how my Chipotle Rib Eye would taste if Mr Iron Chef Flay prepared it for me. I doubt I'll ever be that lucky. But this was one of my most memorable meal.",

C'mon now).  It's inside of Caesar's Palace near the casino area, which was within walking distance from my hotel shuttle's drop off point.  The nice thing about Vegas restaurants is that you have plenty of things to see and do while inside the casinos.  The prices were not as expensive as I had expected, and the food was just as we expected: yummy and SPICY!  We ordered their queso fundido (a four-cheese dip with chips) and the tiger shrimp and roasted garlic corn tamale for appetizers.  The cheese dip was delicious!  We devoured it in minutes, and the tiger shrimp tamale was quite tasty.  I was never a big fan of tamales, but the corn meal was actually one of my favorite parts of Bobby Flay's version.  The sauce makes the tamale, so make sure to soak up as much sauce as you can.  My boyfriend ordered the Mesa burger, which was pink in the center and super, super juicy throughout.  He gave it two thumbs up.  I went with the spicy scrambled eggs, which had goat cheese and jalapenos in it, with mapled ham.  I was quite fond of the ham, and the eggs had a lovely kick to them.  It was a wee bit too much goat cheese for me, but it's pretty well-known that B.F. loves goat cheese in everything.  Still very good, nonetheless.  My friend Henry went with the Mahi Mahi, which he said was also good.  The decor is very fun, and our server was informative and polite.  Next time I'm in Vegas, I will definitely be swinging by again for lunch or dinner.",

When our food arrived, the plate had a big hair on it, I immediately brought it to the attention of the server and the manager who got my food to the table, they took it back and immediately got one back, just by removing the hair, when I asked them why did they get the same plate, they lied and said they made a different one, it was impossible, first of all I had to wait for a good 20 mins before they got my entree out so there was no way they would do another one in seconds, secondly I was sitting very close to the kitchen and saw it with my own eyes that it was the same plate. I decided not to contradict as I had my 3 yr old around, we barely ate, paid the check and walked out, they did not compensate the dish, neither did they apologize. So not done....not going back.",

We went to Mesa Grill on a Sunday for lunch - they had their Brunch Menu available, but we were both craving lunch, so that limited the choices.  The decor of the restaurant is nice - kitschy, but nice.  Things I didn't like - our table was so close to the next one that the lady at the next table knocked off my silverware when seated.  No big deal, but still.  I guess it was s good thing because we were forced to become the best of friends by the end of service since we were seated so closely that we all shared a conversation (if we wanted to or not!)  I ordered the spiced chicken salad and he had the burger (yes he is boring when it comes to food).  The waiter brought over a basket of misc bread products, the most of which were fine.  One (blue cornbread) was awful.  Weird.  The people at the next table asked us if ours was weird too.  LOL.  We asked the waiter what was in it, but nothing seemed out of the ordinary from cornbread - so why so icky?  Anyway - our service was fine.  The fod so-so.  My chicken salad was way over seasoned.  He liked the burger (so maybe you should go boring).  I paid more than I thought the food warranted and made new friends inadvertently(whose french toast looked awesome by the way).",

First off we got seated and when we got our water my auntie had a water bottle and the waiter even asked us if she wanted him to pour her water for her. Now that's what I call service.  They even changed our knives and forks after eating our appetizer while even setting our knives and plates in the right positions.  As for the food the complimentary bread basket with jalapeno cheddar biscuits, scones, blue corn muffins, and blueberry coffee cake was all way delish.  For the entree omg it was so good, it was a bacon potato quesadilla and it was so delish and I don't even really like bacon but it was goooood.  For our entrees we all LOVED what we got I got the spicy eggs with ham biscuits and grits and the eggs were the most fluffy soft eggs I've ever had in my life.  Eating the grits for the first time so good.  My aunite got the green chile cilequilles (sp) and it was really good.  My uncle got the pork sandwich with pepper fries and he like it, my other uncle got this make ur own steak sandwich with eggs and the works with home fries and he also liked it.

After a few visits they've polished it up a bit and got their service and food spot on.  It's our favorite restaurant in Vegas (much the same as it's our favorite restaurant in NYC).  The first couple of times here, when the restaurant was first opened, the service was a bit off, or perhaps we were unlucky and got a newby waiter.  The margaritas seemed to be watered down too.  Thankfully, the good food kept us coming back.  The last couple of visits have been great, and they have their timing and attentiveness dialed-in, and have perfected their margaritas.  They check on you enough without getting in your face every two minutes, and the food is paced well so that you don't have overlapping dishes.  We love the margaritas here, and like to come a bit early and have one or two before the meal.  I like getting the smoky floaters (aged tequila) on top as well.    A few notable items from our last visit: -Tuna nachos.  This is tuna tartare with avocado and chips (and some kind of caper dressing).  This was and is one of our favorite dishes at either Mesa.  Alas, as of our last visit it's been hit by the recession shrink ray.  We used to get one order to share, but its now too small for that and they don't give you enough chips.  It still tastes great though. -Crispy calamari salad.  Basically classed-up fried calamari, but really, really crispy and with a variety of sauces, and called a salad to make you feel better about yourself.  There's a vinagrette, some kind of sundried tomato sauce, and some kind of avocado sauce.  I liked the vinagrette best. -Veal chop with wild rice tamale.  I think this dish has the signature Mesa Grill tastes.  It's basically a really good cut of meat that has been perfectly grilled, with a very nice and slightly spicy sauce on it (some kind of pepper/chipotle sauce) and some demiglace.  Very tender and flavorful on its own with a little zing from the sauce, but not overpowered by the sauce.  The tamale is a nice side. -Green chile ciopinno.  Fish, shrimp, scallops, mussels, and lobster in an excellent green chile broth.  This one is hard to describe; the flavors are pretty unique.  Just try it yourself, it's excellent. -Corn flan with caramel.  I'm not a huge fan of flan, but this is the best flan I've ever had.  Very creamy, and despite being covered in caramel it's not too sweet.  Overall, we love this place and definitely will be back.",

While it was incredibly good, it is small for the price. The entrees though... oh the ENTREES! I had the Ancho Chile- Honey Glazed Salmon (mouth watering delectible!), my husband had the Coffee Spice Rubbed Rotisserie Filet Mignon (he still talks about it and the sauce!) and my friend had the much loved New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin (out of this world!) Best part was since she was newly pregnant, I got the chance to eat what was left on her plate, yes, even after eating my entire meal! We finished off with dessert which I believe was a flourless chocolate cake. Decadent!!! And I must add that the service was extraordinary. Another friend was trying to mess with the waiter by asking him to bring him bottles of beer that had a SPECIFIC date stamped on them and the server happily accomodated his insane requests! In between this craziness, he checked on us frequently and the plates were removed quickly & easily. I plan to always eat here whenever I'm in the area!",

Considering all the meals we have had in Vegas, this was a relative bargain. Standouts included Sophie's Chopped Salad, the Mesa Burger, BBQ Lamb Cobb Salad, and Steak Sandwich. All of these dishes shared Bobby Flay's signature sensibilities...a bit of heat, a touch of sweetness, maybe a bit of tang, and a mixture of textures. While service was attentive and efficient, we felt somewhat rushed. And while we found lunch to be a bargain at these prices, I don't know if I would feel the same way about these entrees at the much higher dinner prices. Nevertheless, Mesa Grill was a pleasant surprise.",

The service was great too, the waitress explained everything about the dishes and made some wonderful recommendations. I ended up trying the shrimp tamale to start, the ancho chile glazed salmon as my main dish, and they had the chef's choice dessert as blueberry profiteroles with fresh whipped cream. SO good. I think the tamale was my favorite. The portions were HUGE too, definitely not what I expected (I figured they'd be small due to the price not being TOO high and the tasting menu moniker). Those at our table who didn't get the tasting menu also enjoyed their meals. Oh yeah, and if you go DEFINITELY get a margarita. I don't even normally like margaritas all that much, but theirs are awesome. I had their signature marg, the Partida Margarita, uses partida tequila (100% blue agave tequila), organic agave and fresh squeezed lime juice. This drink is totally worth the $16 price point. If I'm going to drink, it needs to be GOOD. This was awesome. In short, go to Mesa, enjoy a meal and definitely have a margarita. I tried a few sips of other varieties of the margs and they were all great too (though mine was the best!) Highly recommended! Wish there was one in San Diego :)",

I was expecting to be WOWed! To start, our server was good, we ordered an app, which had a hair in it, ewww. We then got the coffee cake/bread basket which was a nice surprise. Then, an odd moment...we waited for like 15 minutes then the server came by with our check which had our app and food order on it but, we didn't get the food yet. We were both confused. Of course we told the server we didn't get our food yet and it came right out. I guess it was a communication issue. The entree's were great so I can't complain there. Nor sure if I'll go back because it was a little pricey and I've had better at more affordable restaurants.",

As a side we both recommend the roasted corn with grilled cactus, lime and cotija, it stole the show!  In my opinion the greatest side dishes ever!!  Phenomenal food Bobby!

    "text": "Me and my wife decided to go to dinner and try something different.   So I picked the Mesa Grill because of the high reviews it had here.  Plus being one of Bobby Flays restaurants, I had high hopes.  We only had to wait a couple minutes to be seated and the hostess was very nice.  I was impressed by the selection on the menu and many items looked good.    I started out with the Tiger Shrimp Tamales and they were very delicious.  I ordered the Black Angus New York Strip Steak in a medium well.   Well when I got the steak and cut into it the steak was barely rare.   We were sitting fairly close to the meat prep station and I had noticed the cook throw what looked like a frozen steak on the grill.   Then he was more focused on the monday night football game on the TV in the sports book.   To me there is no excuse to order a $48 steak and have it improperly cooked.  I had mentioned it to the waitress and she offered to recook the steak.  I am one not to send anything back to the kitchen because what I have heard they do to return orders.  I figured she would at least mention to the cook that he did not do a good job but she did not try.  Needless to say I was not happy and have definitely had better steaks from a Chili's restaurant.   Overall there was certain parts of the meal that were good but it was truly a disappointment.",

    "text": "I had very high expectations for Mesa Grill as I've become a huge fan of Bobby Flay's and have recreated many of his dishes at home. The restaurant was a mad house which was ok as we knew it was going to be lively and it's literally right in the middle of a casino. We took a seat in the bar and were immediately struck by how unkempt the actual bar was. There was a 2009 best cocktail recipe book stuck on one of the shelves and a bottle of jug wine sitting next to it. I asked for a glass of sparkling wine or champagne and was given a mini bottle that tasted so terrible I had to send it back and get a margarita (which was delicious). We were seated shortly thereafter and our waiter was great - really on top of things and enthusiastic about waiting on us. We ordered a few more drinks (S getting one that was bubblegum pink so he made me switch with him) but were saddened by how awful the wine list was. There were no California wines which would have matched up perfectly to the Tex Mex style of food at Mesa Grill nor were there any great wines to try - it was as if the wine list was a complete afterthought. We persevered and placed our order - to start we ordered the Goat Cheese Queso Fundido and the Salmon and Tuna Tartars. The cheese and salmon were delicious but the tuna smelled really fishy so we sent it back. We were brought another scoop of salmon and all was made right in our worlds. For our main courses, I ordered the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin and S had the Southwestern Spiced Duck Breast. My dish was inedible because the spice rub was too heavy and all you tasted was spice - not seasoning but spice. S was happy with his dish especially the Brussels sprouts he ordered as an additional side. Our waiter handled the situation perfectly and was awesome when I sent mine back so it wasn't a big deal. All in all, I had high expectations for Mesa Grill and they fell flat against what was delivered. It felt like Bobby Flay put his name on the restaurant and just left. I can't imagine that he'd be thrilled with the food that was leaving the kitchen and the atmosphere didn't feel like a celebrity chef was involved except for the conception of the idea and that where it stopped. The one bright spot were the Brussels sprouts - amazing and only a handful of ingredients (you can find the recipe in his Mesa Grill cook book).",

    "text": "I tried really hard to like it, but given my expectations, I'd have to say I'm sorely disappointed.  Not to say the stuff wasn't tasty, because it was. But that's all it really was. It was not a religious experience or anything that I haven't had before. It was decent, unadventurous food at prices that flabbergasted me. If I'm paying for a name, I expect a distinctive meal and unfortunately I didn't get it on my visit.  I liked the ambiance of the restaurant, though of course since it's in Vegas you get the occasional rowdy cheer from the betting area. Servers were fine but didn't seem as professional as I would have liked for dinner service in that they did a poor job of blending into the surroundings and made some odd seating decisions (shoved me and my friend into the back of the restaurant when there weren't that many guests at the time). Speaking of that the lighting in the very back of the restaurant is a bit underwhelming, though for the rest of the restaurant I felt it was just fine. The seating in the back was a bit closer than I would like, as people that were seated next to us during the course of the meal were far too close (leaning over in any way and there would be contact) and I could easily listen in on other conversations which I don't think is appropriate for the type of restaurant it is.  So onto the food:  Bread basket consisted of muffins, a jalapeno bread, and a raisin bread. The raisin bread had a vaguely fermented scent and was slightly soggy, so I wasn't quite sure what was up with that. The muffin was quite crumbly and didn't have much distinct flavor, which would be a theme for the rest of the night, as the jalapeno bread also lacked any semblance of heat to perk up my tastebuds. The bread basket was really nothing to write home about.  I started off with the Blue Corn Pancake with BBQ duck. Flavors were balanced well, if a bit reserved. The sauces were straightforward and somewhat banal. BBQ duck was sweet and the meat flaky, though I felt that the duck really lacked the sort of gameiness and distinctive flavor I associate with duck. If not for the texture and mouth feel someone could have told me it was some other mystery meat and I probably wouldn't have made much of a fuss. The blue corn tortilla was what you would expect, though a bit thicker than I would have liked. The microgreens that topped the appetizer were really unnecessary and contributed nothing to the dish and I wonder if maybe there was another decorative herb that would have had some impact on the flavors rather than just the appearance of the plate. All in all a fairly well-decorated plate but average tasting dish. Portion was extremely lacking.  Since it was the holidays, my server informed me they were serving an exclusive dish consisting of pork chop with sweet potato and apple. I was intrigued and opted out of my original entree choice. The plate itself was decorated nicely and had a really homey, \"straight from grandma's house\" feel to it which I liked.  I wasn't sure if I made the right decision or not by choosing this, but the pork chop dish was tame at best. My server did inform me that there wouldn't be as much spice as the pork tenderloin dish they serve, but the double-cut pork chop itself didn't even have a strong porky flavor. The meat was drier than I would have liked. If they did any other sort of marinade or preparation for the meat, I couldn't taste it. The ancho-chile sauce it was paired with was a good, but again, very reserved match-- the dish had almost non-existent heat. I can't call anything on the dish bland and they were seasoned fairly well, it's just that nothing was particularly distinctive or elevated the ingredients. The sweet potatoes were sliced and served simply as is-- I'm guessing they were sauteed in a flavored butter of some sort, as it was still very firm and didn't taste exactly like you would expect sweet potato to taste like. I had been expecting a more thorough preparation or at least mashed sweet potato to fit a holiday theme, so I was a bit surprised to see how it was served-- but surprisingly the flavor was very unique, almost nutty. The roasted apple, stuffed with walnuts and cinnamon, was probably the star of the night and tasted great-- tart, fragrant, and not particularly sugary at all. A wonderful holiday treat. The portions on the dish were all well-sized, balanced, and appropriate.  So while Mesa Grill is probably worth another visit on my part, from what I could tell the exorbitant prices didn't justify what was served. I don't doubt they could have had an off day, but I was hoping the dishes would really pack significant flavor and everything was just a small blip on my tastebuds. Given Flay's reputation for stronger, bolder flavors, I expected more. And even if it wasn't Flay's flagship restaurant, I would still give the same verdict of good, but not great, food.",

This property is pretty much a ghost town for breakfast foods so we waited for Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill to open.   We've eaten here before for lunch and dinner but the appetizer menu is so perfect for brunch. The Mushroom quesadilla with a soft fried egg on top is to die for and the duck tacos are phenomenal!  Next time we will order the duck with less sauce but that's our taste, perhaps not yours.   We will do this again for sure and when we need a bite to eat on the gambling floor Mesa may be our #1 choice for to go orders",

The sauce to go with it was amazing it was spicy and sweet all such a great mix! I had to also have the Queso Fundido which was the perfect amount of heat! So cheesy and satisfying! The side Asparagus had I believe queso cotija but that was OMG SO good! Not to soft not to crunchy it was just perfect! What I love about this place is the portions are always so perfect and filling! I also cannot forget the sticky toffee chocolate cake, I haven't had a better dessert in my life! It was a burst of sweet and salty flavors in my mouth and I was able to taste all the different flavors in the cake. I also want to thank JAMES for being an amazing server, service with a smile and so outgoing and always checked on us making sure we had all that we needed! He made us comfortable and made sure we enjoyed every last bite. He has to be the best server I've ever had! People like him make the restaurant the 5 star that it is! Thank you Mesa Grill for yet another amazing experience! P.S LOVE LOVE THE BREAD!",

I personally loved the Shrimp Tamale as this was a great upgrade to your typical Mexican tamale. For our main entree we ordered the Scallops and the Pork Tenderloin. Both dishes were perfectly cooked. The Scallops came with grits which was a good complement to the dish. The Pork Tenderloin had a great smoke flavor and a tasty corn tamale.

The bread basket is great, with a nice variety of items to choose from.   Try the 22-oz bone in chipotle rubbed ribeye. The steak is SO flavorful and perfectly cooked.   If they have they Lobster Tacos and Meyer Lemon cheesecake they are must tries!  I went here with Several work colleagues during CES, and I am so glad we made a trip to Bobby Flay's restaurant.",

As we entered we politely gave the hostess our name and reservation time and the hostess said NOTHING to us as we followed her to the table. She turned and walked away. REAL attitude. THE waiter basically destroyed the evening. How does a business like this hire such poor attitude employees???? He would go over to the side and use his cell in front or guests, then you would have to flag him down. This is a basically over hyped tourist trap. Food was OK, and seriously over priced. There are certainly BETTER choices out there. Felt like I need a tourist map to enter the place. Such a let down for a evening.",

My wife and I wanted to try this place simply because we watch way to much of the cooking channel, and we love Bobby Flay! We did the dinner pairing. My wife had the Sophie's salad and I started with the tiger prawn tamale, yum! Main course was 16 spice chicken for my lady and I had the Ancho chilie salmon, both stellar choices! My wife had to pass on the dessert since they pretty much brought out the largest portion of chicken ever served in a restaurant. Being the gluten for punishment that I am I went in on the coconut cake, it was extremely decadent! Even though we didn't have a whole lot of interaction with our server, the entire staff worked as a team which made for a pleasant dining experience.",

You MUST order it when you come here.   Unfortunately, everything else was so-so. My margarita was a little too sweet for my liking. I didn't care for the bread options, a jalapeno corn bread and a spicy French bread. I ordered a burger because I've always wanted to try one of Bobby's burgers, but I was soo disappointed! Perhaps I had really high expectations? But it wouldn't even make my top 10 favorite burgers. Although it was gorgeous, the burger patty had some meat tendons in it that skeeved me out, it was so greasy that when I picked it up everything kind of slid off of the bun so it was super hard to eat. The southwestern fries were ok as well, they were really just seasoned fries. For an $18 burger I expected a lot more.  The service was great though, fast and efficient. It is a little tight in here, we were sat at a table for 2 and were almost rubbing elbows with the table next to us.  I have dined at other Bobby Flay restaurants and fallen in love, I won't give up on him just yet!",

The spice rub was a little too spicy for me but it is easy to decrease the spice by eating around it. My friend had the lamb chops which he loved. And my other friend had the salmon which she enjoyed as well.  The bread was delicious, we enjoyed 3 different types: corn muffins, raisin, and Asiago jalapeno. I don't normally like jalapeno but I ended up asking for more of the Asiago jalapeno bread because it was just that good.   We had a peach margarita that was amazing, and a partida margarita which was recommended by the waiter and delicious as well. My friend had a San Domingo mezcal which had a lot of smokiness behind it.  The portion size looks small for the price but we were so full leaving that we had to go back to the hotel for a nap.  Would expect nothing less from Bobby!",

I order the black widow mojito and the blue corn pancake (just an appetizer). I ate this thing in about two bites (not including the two my fiancee had as well because there was almost enough to share). The sauces were freaking great and I did not make an error as there are no less than 3 separate sauces on this dish which resembles an unsealed empanada. The bar area (which is where I ate and drank my dinner) was very comfortable and the food was full of flavors both smoky and crisp. The liquor probably helped which is why there are only three stars. I will have to go back sober and get a full sit-down dinner.",

We had the Green Pea and Green Chili Soup, which was really good, but everything else was not remarkable.  We had the Wild Mushroom Quesadilla, but that was no big deal.  My wife's quesadilla is way better.  I had the Spicy Tuna and Salmon Tartares.  Without the sauce that was drizzled on the plate, there wasn't much taste to them.  It came with plantains, which was cool and the sauce wasn't bad.    For entrees, my wife asked if the Ancho Chili-Honey Glazed Salmon was spicy.  The waiter said no and that the soup was spicier.  He had it backwards.  She said it was good, but wouldn't tell people to go here just to get it.  I had the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin at the suggestion of the waiter.  Again, without the sauce, there wasn't really any taste.  The pork was tender though.  The BBQ sauce it came with reminded me of Everett and Jones in Oakland, but I like their sauce better.    Service was great though.  They were very attentive and did everything we asked.  One flaw is that when we called in, we weren't sure if there were going to be 2 or 4 of us.  We told the reservationist, which probably worked for the casino, and he said, just make it for 4, and call back and adjust it to 2 if things changed.  When we called back to let them know, they told us that we would have to move our reservations to an hour earlier or later since we changed the reservation.  Huh?  I know that it isn't great for the restaurant, but we thought we were doing them a favor.  Never had that problem before.  We should have showed up and played dumb when the other couple didn't show up.    Anyway, wish our experience was better.",

We sat near the kitchen, and a man in a sweatshirt and knit ski cap leaned against the kitchen window throughout our entire meal. When we asked why he could wear a hat, the manager said that hats were allowed in the lounge. If they are going to implement a dress code they should start with shorts and sweatshirts, and make their guests aware of the policy. As far as the food, they were out of three dishes and had no specials. I ended up ordering Sophies chopped salad which should be on the kids menu, it was mostly cheese cubes, tortilla chips and garbanzo beans. For dinner I ordered a coffee rubbed filet, which was so spicy, I went through a tube of tums while out after dinner. The shrimp in the tamale appetizer was good. The margaritas were too sweet.

    "text": "Did you know that Mesa Grill serves an amazing brunch?   Okay, so their dinner is fantastic too, but let's talk about the brunch. You get the same luscious breadbasket at brunch that you get at dinner, but it includes a coffee cake thing with a crumbly topping.  So yummy. The goat cheese queso fundido is an appetizer on both the brunch and dinner menus.  It is cheese heaven and the portion is so ginormous that four people can easily share it.   As far as brunch entrees go, both the chilaquiles and the tostada are fabulous.  I love eggs and I love spicy and I doubly love spicy eggs.  Next time I am going to try the enchiladas. The brunch entrees come with either grits or potatoes.  I am not a big fan of potatoes so I always get the grits and they always rock my world.  They are so rich I am not sure how anyone can eat the whole bowl, but wow, are they tasty! Then, they have a full dessert menu at brunch (which changes every so often). Very smart!  By that time, my dining companions and I have to share one because we are so full, but their desserts are a perfect end to a perfect brunch.",

    "text": "I've been to Mesa Grill in Caesars palace several times for dinner and I admit I'm clearly infatuated with Bobby Flay's style of cooking even if he is an ass.  The atmosphere is comfortable, the dress casual, and the place has been hopping every time I've been.  I definitely recommend making reservations a couple days in advance if you want to eat at a reasonable time, but if you don't, there is a bar in the waiting area where you can have a few tasty Mesa Grill margaritas.  The service was very good the times I've been and I think I found the best waitress I've ever had here.  Not only was she very responsive and knowledgeable with the menu, she told us what was \"just alright\" and was genuinely friendly.  I'm talking about someone who will sit down next to you and engage you a bit, instead of just feigning interest and listlessly read through the specials.  In short, the food here is a flavor explosion in your mouth.  For starters, I recommend the very rich Goat Cheese Queso Fundido and the flavorful Yucatan Chicken Tacos even though the portion sizes are small for the price.  A selection of complimentary breads comes with the meal and they are quite unique.  Use caution with the Blue Corn Cake Muffin, though, because it's very crumbly and likely to end up all over you if you aren't careful.    For the entree, I can't rave enough about the New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin.  I've never had Pork that cuts like butter and rests in the perfect amount of spicy goodness.  Other contenders are the Coffee rubbed filet mignon and the chipotle glazed rib-eye.  For side dishes, don't pass up the roasted corn or Chorizo-goat cheese tamale.  Salmon is usually my favorite dish, but the Ancho Chile-honey glazed salmon was just alright.  The last time I was there I couldn't find the dessert I had the time before.  When I asked about it they told me that they had a new pastry chef.  I decided to try the pineapple buttermilk upside down cake from the new dessert menu and it was divine.  I don't need the menu anymore; this is an automatic order.  So, why 4 stars instead of 5?  First, the reservations; when you call ahead you have to give them your credit card number so they can charge you $50 a head in the event that you don't show up without cancelling before 3pm the same day.  That seems ridiculous to me considering that they would have no problem filling the seats with walk ups.  Second, the food is pricey for the quantity.  I know its Vegas, but a little bigger portion for the appetizers wouldn't hurt them too much.  Finally, if you come with a big party they stick you in a not so attractive back room on a large folding table covered with a cloth.  Aside from being a bit tacky, it makes you feel isolated from the bustling atmosphere in the main dining room.  While none of these are show stoppers, it was enough to dock them a star.  I'll be back to try the rest of the menu.",

    "text": "We ended up sitting at the bar at Mesa Grill, which I like because sometimes you can meet interesting people at the bar. The gentleman to my left suggested the Veal (Fire Roasted Veal Chop w/Horseradish - Maple Glaze & Wild Rice Tamale + Sage Butter). Being that he was a meat distributer, we took him on his word. We also ordered the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin w/ Bourbon - Ancho Chile Sauce & Sweet Potato Tamale + Crushed Pecan Butter and for an appetizer, the Blue Corn Pancake w/ Barbecued Duck + Habanero Chile-Star Anise Sauce. The Blue Corn Pancake w/ BBQd Duck came out first. It was yummy and quite different from what I'm used to. I'd definitely would recommend it for anyone that wants to try BBQ Duck that's not typical Peking Duck.  Our entrees came out next. The veal chop was probably a bit hyped up. The best way to describe it was that we were underwhelmed by the veal. I've had really tender roast veal at Pines of Rome (Pines of Rome on Yelp) where I didn't need to cut it with a knife; it just fell of the bone. The veal at Mesa Grill was a bit tough to cut up and eat and we could barely taste the maple in the horseradish-maple glaze. The wild rice tamale w/ sage butter was definitely tastier than the veal. Kind of disappointing being that the veal dish was $42 and we only enjoyed the tamale! The pork tenderloin was much better but not quite living up to the reviews we've read on Yelp (reviews). The spices seemed to overwhelm the pork and I struggled with rubbing off some of the ancho chile sauce which was liberally \"drizzled\" all over the pork tenderloin (it was also all over the blue corn pancake w/ duck). The saving grace of the meal was the delicious sweet potato tamale w/ pecan butter. That definitely helped balance the heavily spiced pork and it was all around yummy goodness! All in all, I definitely would give Mesa Grill another shot but wouldn't feel compelled to order the veal or the pork tenderloin again.... But definitely the sweet potato tamale!",

Mesa Grill was very well put together and a lunch I will never forget!  Our table loved the corn muffin in the bread basket.  Devoured that completely.  We each shared a bit of our own plate.  1.  Sweet Potato soup - creamy, sweet, with a kick of spice 2.  Shrimp tamale - shrimp was cooked perfectly; very tender; sauce was smooth and paired well with the dish 3.  Honey Glazed salmon - ordered it medium; also tender, flaky and soft, greens melted in my mouth 4.  Corn crusted Chile Relleno - absolutely phenomenal!  Crunchy outside, creamy and flavorful inside.  Kicks in a bit of spice, too! 5.  Burger - It was good, pretty juicy 6.  Pork sandwhich - I don't know what they put in this but it was great! 7.  Dessert - buttermilk spice upside down cake, sweet, warm, soft, incredibly well spiced.  Mouth watering just thinking of it.    I would definitely go back again.  And if you are considering lunch or dinner there, expect to pay a pocket full of change.  You really do get what you pay for... great food at a great cost.",

Now i never tried venisen before and was told the meat was simliar to lamb and it was quite a good description.  My dish came out on 2 chops, kinda stingy but it was filling to say the least.  The order comes with a mini corn cake on the side, VERY VERY small, a dark brown sauce that is pretty good...a little bit sweat and tangy , but basically the dish is served a la carte.  I would recommend ordering a side of something... my friends got mashed potatoes, some got fries, and another ordered a blue-corn pancake thing that was $14 and not very good..haha.  I had an opportunity to try their NY-Steak $40 on their menu and it was probably the best tasting meats I've ever had.  It was really full of flavor and not blood or running in any way.  I'm sure they let it sit out after cooking to hold in the juices or it was frozen before grilling.  The meat was pretty rare even though it was supposed to be cooked medium.    Overall this place is good, very good, but very expensive.  Be prepared to shell around at least $50 per person.  Like the other reviews, this place is GREAT to bring your girl friend, wife, husband, parents, in-laws....very impressive.",

For the main course, I had the 22oz. chipotle glazed ribeye. While I'm a traditionalist when it comes to steak preparation (happy with salt and pepper), The steak was pleasantly unique, served with a red and green sauce that had a flavorful kick. The house syrah was perfectly paired with the bold, spicy flavors of Flay's cooking.  Service was good as well. The waiter had a really cool European accent. I'd rather have a Euro accent than Flay's New Yawk accent.",

I also sampled some of the garlic shrimp and roasted garlic corn tamale as well as the spicy chicken with sweet potato hash.  Every dish was really quite good, no disappointments whatsoever. Each dish was very tasty, flavorful and often had a nice little kick to it as the spices were plentiful -- many dishes having a blend of chiles, spices or peppers, but not an overpowering amount, and added extra depth to the taste of the food.",

Mind you 2 of the 5 of us live in smaller town Wisco and don't eat chiles too often. They all liked it very well. I had the New Mexican Chile Rubbed Pork Tenderloin. It was cooked very well with a nice crust and covered in ancho sauce. The tamale that came with it was great as well. Other items that I tried included the Queso Fundido with Goat Cheese and the Brussel Sprouts with Walnuts and Pommegranate seeds. Both were great sides and starters.

    "text": "I'm not a huge Bobby Flay fan but the combination of perusing the Forum Shops, hunger pangs, Spago not being opened for lunch yet, and our 11:00am rum buzz made us take a chance on brunch at Mesa Grill.  I can only describe the decor of this place as \"southwestern kitsch\" because of the festive colors, clear plastic wheelbarrows (yup), and wooden accents. It's an interesting setting, but not really my style. The menu was--surprise--southwest, but with hints of new flavors, such as the Ancho Chile-Honey Glazed Salmon with Spicy Black Bean Sauce or Spicy Chicken with Sweet Potato Hash. Vlad ordered the latter and I ordered the Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad (no goat cheese, vinaigrette on the side).   After taking our orders, the table bread arrived, which IMO really was the highlight. The basket came with jalapeno cornbread, dried fruit scones, and blue corn muffins. . . rather than your average bread that looks and feels like it's been sitting out all day. Vlad and I really enjoyed the blue corn muffins - they were both sweet and savory all in the same bite. While we waiting for our mains, I looked over at the table next to me only to see the most gigantic burger ever. The Mesa Burger does not mess around! It looks like you literally have to dislocate your jaw in order to take one bite. Luckily the lady who ordered it cut it in half and shared with her man. In retrospect, maybe I shouldn't have been closely observing these poor patrons like they were lab rats? Whatevs, it's Vegas.   Vlad was pleased with his dish, while mine was a bit bland. After taking out the goat cheese and vinaigrette, there really is nothing to that salad but chicken and spinach. Actually, the chicken was atop a mini blue corn tortilla, but that's about it. I had to pull off the \"sixteen spice\" fat from each chicken strip, which I believe was intentionally included for \"flavor\". Once the fat was taken off, they were just season-less chicken strips. I think the waiter felt sorry for my substituted dish and brought out 3 vinaigrettes for me to add variety. It helped a little. The green onion one was the best tasting.    Overall, I'd come here again for the festive table bread but will definitely order something else. Perhaps the Roasted Pumpkin Soup with Smoked Chiles and Pomegranate Crema?",

    "text": "\"Explosion of flavors in your mouth\" or \"electrified taste buds\" or whatever the current catch phrase is on Food TV shows, that's exactly what happens at Mesa Grill. One bite after another, you discover a new layer of taste in your food, now it's spicy, now it's tangy, now it's sweet, now it's salty! The colors are bright, the flavors are rich and bold, but you can still taste the ingredient. You still get to enjoy the buttery lobster tail. You still get that crunch in the corn.   I can't voucher for the dishes my dining companions got, although it must say something if my husband decided to take his leftover pork tenderloin with us all the way back to SF.   From the very start, the corn muffin was delicious with a bit of chili to give it a little kick. Duck with pancake was special and different from most duck I have tasted. Very saucy and flavorful. Side of corn reminded us of the Mexican corn from NY's Habana Cafe, but shaved and served in a small skillet so it was easy to share (and worth fighting for). My entree, the cioppino, had generous amount of mussels, fish, scallop and lobster tail. All delicious in a light green chile stew.   Very memorable meal, very worth the very high price. Service was friendly and timely. It was a good idea to make a reservation even though it was a Sunday night. After arrived on time, we waited for a bit at the bar and enjoyed some delicious and pricey margaritas.  Yay for Bobby Flay!",

    "text": "I wish I would've written this review straight after I finished my meal, but I\"ll try my best to accurately describe the joy I felt after each bite.   I will have to preface this review by saying that I never had the urge to try any of Bobby Flay's restaurant b/c I thought \"how can you turn Southwestern food and flavors into fine dining\" especially being that I'm from Texas. Boy was I wrong.  We started with the Shrimp with Blue Corn Tamale, Chicken tacos, and the quesadilla. The shrimp was perfectly cooked, the tamale-delicious. My fave appetizer is the Quesadilla. I love goat cheese, I love truffle oil. The combination is electrifying. This is a must try.   I had the veal chop, and let me tell you that each bite sent shivers down my spine. I let out a slight moan every time I would put a piece of meat in my mouth. The veal was so tender, and the flavoring. Succulent. Each bite sent me closer and closer to nirvana.   My friend had the duck, which I asked her to order. OMFG, Excellent. Divine. Fantabulous. I could go on and on. The duck was perfect. It was tender but had just the right amount of gamey-ness to it. When I go back again, I don't know if I'll have the veal or duck. Both were excellent.   Bobby Flay has always been known for his robust flavors and I have to say that I\"m hitting myself in the head for not trying his restaurants before. Every dish I tried was just amazing. Each bite is like fireworks in your mouth.",

    "text": "Delicious. Very overpriced for the appetizers, however, the flavors are incredible. Oh Bobby Flay...you are good at what you do...wish you would start cooking Asian style though where portion sizes can feed 20, when there are only four at the table.   Appetizer: Duck Pancake - tender meat, sweet and spicy taste - small portion, wished the dish at least came with two pancakes.   Entrees: Rib eye and chicken.  The rib eye was flavorful, however, the meat carried a lot of fat and my bf isn't a big fan. The rib eye was glazed with this spicy and sweet sauce. Yep, seems as though Mr. Flay likes those combos and rightfully so!   I had the chicken and pesto mashed potatoes with a side of walnut, pomegranate and vinaigrette brussels sprouts. All of it. ALLL OF ITT was incredibly  delicious. The chicken was cooked just right and the sauce that it was smothered in had a bold flavor full of the right spices. My favorite part of the meal was the side of brussels sprouts. Just when you thought it was going to be overpoweringly sweet the bitterness of the Brussels sprouts come stomping in. Holy crap... it was so good.   Drinks: Patron margarita  - average, nothing spectacular. At the price of $13...pass next time.   Dessert: banana cream hazelnut pudding pie - no words can truly describe how good this simple dish was. The pudding had hazelnut. That's enough info for you. Order it and thank me later.    Free stuff: bread  Don't think this is just an obvious \"duh, bread is always free.\" Get ready to have your mind blown at the tasty bread basket sample your waiter brings you. The jalapeno cornbread with a sliver of melted butter...BOMB.    Only downside of the dinner was the chair. Someone placed a giant piece of gum on the edge of my chair....ended up on the back of my calve. Gross. Very. Very. Gross.",

You haven't had corn until you've tried this and it's just corn lol for dessert my mom and I split this chocolate cake with salted rice crispies on the top and a caramel sauce pooled on the bottom.  Let me tell you I have no idea what they put in this cake to make it taste so incredibly decadent but this is HANDS DOWN the BEST chocolate cake I've ever eaten in my life.  Who knew rice crispies could pair so perfectly with chocolate cake.  If your thinking \"oh it's just another chocolate cake\" it's NOT!! Everyone needs this cake in their lives, ok I'm done. Lol",

The hubs and I were able to sneak in for a last minute dinner reservation over the July 4th weekend (it was a mini miracle bc they were totally booked unless we wanted to eat after 10pm. I didnt know if I could handle that - this girl GOTS to eat - so we decided to eat elsewhere. By chance I looked on OpenTable around 6pm that same night and saw a table opened up for 7:45pm and we took it in a snap!).  We arrived and were quickly seated. The bread basked is totally delicious - I had to refrain from eating all the goodies to save room for the main stars. My husband got the cioppino and I got the pork tenderloin. Both were fantastic but man, oh man, that pork tenderloin was beyond good. I am still thinking about it and how delicious all of that plate was....oh dear, I'm salivating now...losing focus....

    "text": "I love Bobby Flay and I have been dying to taste his food, so when we planned our trip to Vegas eating at Mesa was on my must do list.  And the food did not disappoint, so I'll start there.  My husband and I like to try and split multiple dishes, so here's what we had:  Blue Corn Lobster Tacos - perfect balance of sweet and spicy.  These were tiny, but so good!  Goat Cheese \"Queso Fundido\" - rich, creamy, and delicious.  This was one of my favorites!  Blue Corn Crusted Halibut - perfectly seasoned, flakey, sauce with a bit of heat - it was everything I had wished it would be.  Side of Cilantro Pesto Mashed Potatoes - amazing.  The flavor combination was delicious and they were creamy and rich and amazing.  Side of Corn - this was probably our favorite.  The flavors were amazing.  You have to get the side of corn.  We also had two Cactus Pear Margaritas that were just the right amount of sweet and a relief from all of the watered down cocktails we'd been finding all over Vegas.  So here's the bad.  Our server was horrible.  We love to get recommendations and find out more about the food and our server seemed annoyed when we asked what the best dishes were.  He barely spoke to us the entire meal.  We sat for 10 minutes with empty plates in front of us while we watched him chat with a co-worker in the middle of the dining room floor.  Our bread basket stayed on our table until the check came, which made it impossibly cluttered.  We explained we would be splitting meals, but we had to ask for separate plates.  When he did finally come to clean our table, he did not say one word the entire time.  Never asked how our food was.  Never came over during the meal to check in.  It was not just bad service, it was awkward.  All we could do was laugh it was so bad.  The worst part was that it seems like our server was the odd man out.  All over the restaurant we could hear other tables receiving excellent service and menu advice and attention.  The staff that checked us in and greeted us was great.  The people who ran our food out and bussed some of our dishes were polite and friendly.  It seems like we just got the bad egg, but it really did ruin the experience I was so excited about.  All in all, I will still give this place a high rating because I really do think the service is not universally bad.  And the food was amazing.  If the service had matched the food this could have been one of the highlights of the trip.  I still love Bobby - I just think he needs to let this server go.",

    "text": "My husband and I were visiting Las Vegas and I knew my husband would love the food at Mesa Grill.  We decided to go for lunch since it is a bit pricey.  We arrived around 11:45 on a Monday.   I was surprised by how crowded it was already.  We ordered two burgers - the Mesa Burger for myself, my husband ordered Green Chile Cheese Burger ($16 each).    Then we waited... and waited... and waited.  The waiter apologized for the delay... and we waited some more.  Finally we asked to speak to the manager.  By the time the manager came by we had received our food, 55 minutes later - for two burgers.  My husband explained the situation.  The manager was very nice, apologized, and told us there would be no charge for the burgers.   The food was great.  The fries were absolutely perfect - maybe the best I've ever had.  My only complaint is that the burger was so big I could hardly fit it in my mouth.  We enjoyed the food so much that we took a chance on ordering dessert and hoped it wouldn't take as long as our entrees did.  We ordered the Chocolate Pretzel Tart with  Spicy Peanut Butter-Chocolate Swirl Ice Cream.  It was amazing.  I'm not usually that into spicy food, but somehow the spicy ice cream was the perfect compliment to the tart.  One of the most interesting desserts I've ever had.    When we asked our waiter for the check he told us the meal was on the house - entrees, dessert, drinks, everything - and he hoped we would come back.  We gave him a very nice tip (I don't think the food delay was his fault at all).  To top it off, the manager approached us again on the way out and apologized for the service and he, too, invited us to come back again.  At the time the wait for the food was really, really frustrating, but we were very satisfied with the manner in which the manager and server handled the situation, and the food is delicious.  We'll definitely return again.",

I spent 48.00 on a filet mignon and if it were 75.00 i probably would pay that price to for it. Seriously! Ive eaten here probably about 3 times now and its always a guaranted great meal! The times i have been here i have only eaten the filet mignon so i am not really sure how anything else tastes, the filet is good enough for me! lol  Tender, succulent, juicy, lighty crusted I dont know what else you would want in a piece of meat. Perfection!  I would not recommend big groups to eat here cuz it was a little difficult to get a reservation considering the amount of people we had (8). We were able to make reservations for a friday night luckily and we were in and out very quickly. service was pretty good too, very attentive.   But if you get the chance eat here! I promise you wont regret it!!!",

I highly recommend that margarita, and after 2 of those, you will feel good.  We started off with the queso fundido, and it was gone in a few minutes, the dish may or may not have been scraped to complete emptiness.  I ordered the blue mesa burger, it is big enough to split between 2 people, and their seasoned fries were tasty.  Another person at the type ordered the chille burger with some sort of white cheese on it, it was really good.  Burgers are HUGE here and worth every $$$$!  I loved the service, and I will come back when I go back to Vegas.",

First off, they wouldn't seat us in the dining area because my sister's fiance was wearing a hipster trash wife beater, so we decided to sit in the bar.  We would have left at that point, but we were too hungry to find another place.    Our waitress Christine was delightful and the food was very good.  I had the smoked shrimp tacos, which were delicious but a bit salty.  Plus, there were only 6 little shrimp on a $22 plate.   We were all too hung over to get a drink, but the tequila selection was extensive and looked quite tempting.    Overall, I'd go back and not dress like a scumbag so I can sit in the restaurant.  Dinner did look pricey, so lunch was a great time to go.",

Both were really good, but overly heavy, creamy, and overpriced! We were also served a basket of various breads, which were baked fresh and were pretty neat. EVeryone seemed to be raving about the blue corn muffin, but i found it to be too crumbly and not very sweet for a muffin. My favorite out of the bread basket was the asiago cheese jalapeno bread.   Overall, food was delicious, but just overly heavy and overpriced. The service at the restaurant, however, is absolutely superb. Fantastic service from our server, and also by the rest of the staff that greets you when you enter and also bids you farewell as you leave.",

The pork sandwich had a kick of spice but the meat was a tad too chewy (~$18).  The swordfish sandwich was absolutely forgettable (~$18).  If I had to choose my 'favorite' part of my meal, I'd choose the fries that came w/ the sandwiches.  The fries were crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and had a unique blend of seasoning on the outside.  Other important info: located next to sportsbook, great service, mediocre food that is priced too high, latin/western/american theme?! (as experienced in music, upholstery theme, and general decor).",

I have been to Mesa Grill before, maybe 4 or 5 years ago and remember it being phenomenal.  Food Network celebrity chef Bobby Flay owns the place, and that is a pretty damn good endorsement.  It's also in one of my favorite Vegas spots, Caesars Palace.  We started with a delicious Chicken Quesadilla appetizer, but moved into bigger and better items with the main course...  The girls each ordered the Sixteen Spice Chicken with garlic-mango sauce and buttermilk-chive mashed potatoes.  Alby ordered the Grilled Pineapple Mahi Mahi with green chile rice.  And I had the New Mexican Spice Rubbled Pork Tenderloin with a sweet potato tamale.  We all shared bites with each other.  I thought the Mahi was best, the girls thought the Pork was best.  Alby liked the chicken.  All three items were actually pretty spicy and hot (warning to you wusses out there).  I will say, my sweet potato tamale with pecan butter was untouchable as far as our side dishes went.  Dessert was the only blemish on a perfect evening of dining.  We had the Peach Berry Cobbler, and while it was good... the awful ginger ice-cream really put a strange and unnecessary twist to it.  Overall, five stars and a great place for a good meal in Sin City.  Another bonus is that it is next to the Caesars Sports Book if there is any wait for a table...",

My friend and I shared the special prawn appetizer that night and I sopped up the sauce with bread it was fantastic!  I had the chili rubbed rib eye, I enjoyed the 22oz three times;  once at restaurant and twice at home. Great doggy bag! My friend had the rellano, I tasted a bite it was very flavorful.  For dessert my friend had the coconut cake, it had a great mouth feel and the coconut flavor was not strong. I had the blueberry lemon tart with blueberry marshmallow ice cream. It was good. The tart shell was too hard which decreased the enjoyment. The service was good. If I could have I would given a 4.5, but you can't so I went in the fair direction.  I just may return ;-)",

    "text": "Oh Bobby Flay, how you make my mouth water!  Definitely a pricey dinner, but you will get extremely solid food here, so treat yourself!  The upside is that it is casual too, so you dont have to worry about the bowties and heels, if you dont want to =)  We got their House margarita which was a margarita martini thing and I have to say, one of the absolute smoothest I have ever had.  It was just tequila, and a squeeze of lime (no triple sec or other crap to water it down).  Just divine! Along with the bread and butter on the table, great way to introduce the restaurant.  Here is what else hit the table: 1) Blue corn tortilla lobster tacos - WARNING: They are extremely tiny. There are three, but one is like the size of those stress balls things you squeeze?  so like the bottom of the shell of the taco was like 3inches. 2) Tuna steak with a side of cous cous - Tuna steak was perfectly cooked rare and the cous cous was flavored perfectly 3) Lamb chop with blueberry sauce - My bro in the law was trying to lick the plate, LOL. 4) Side of Brussel sprouts - Cooked perfectly with crunch and flavor penetration 5) Side of Mashed potatoes with green chile sauce - the creamiest, most delicious papas I have ever had 6) Side of Corn tamale - It was a bit dry, but I think if there was a bit more sauce it would have been great 7) Side of Collard greens - YUMMO!!! Personally, I prefer a little less liquid, so its not soupy at the bottom, but the flavor was on point 8) Layered Coconut Cake - Super light and coconutty =)  All in all, a delicious meal!  Like i said, a bit pricey, but with that level of food, it was worth it!",

    "text": "My boyfriend heard about this place and wanted to try it out. We made reservations for dinner, and I'm glad we did because the restaurant was packed when we arrived.   First came out the bread and butter. There were three different kinds, one for the each of us, including jalapeno cheese bread, cornbread, and raisin bread. It was a nice change from the usual, plain bread options.  For our entrees, I ordered the ancho chile-honey glazed salmon with roasted jalapeno crema, and my boyfriend had the New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin with bourbon-ancho chile sauce and a sweet potato tamale. I asked for my salmon to be cooked medium well, and for the pork tenderloin, the server recommended having it cooked medium, and my boyfriend agreed.   I'm not big on seafood, but the salmon was amazing! It was light and moist, and the accompanying sauces were delicious. I ate it up! My boyfriend enjoyed the pork tenderloin. I had a bite, and it was incredibly tender. The tamale with crushed pecan butter was a nice side dish, but it was a little dry. We also shared a side of roasted corn with grilled cactus, lime, and cotija cheese. It was very creamy, but it was tasty and enough for the both of us.  We took a look at the dessert menu, and we wanted to try a chocolate and fruit dessert, but we were told that they were out, so apparently, it's a popular one. I can't find it on the current online menu. None of the other dessert options appealed to us, and we were full, so we skipped it.  Service was excellent. One of our servers accidentally dropped a piece of ice in our corn side dish, and before I realized what happened, he brought out another one for us at no extra charge. The atmosphere was nice, but the tables were a little too close together. Prices are expensive, but I think it was worth it.",

Both were really good. I usually don't like tamales (no offense, maybe I've only had bad ones) because they are always so dry, but this one was moist and full of flavor. The corn was the perfect accompaniment too. As for the margarita, you can custom-create your own from their list of tequilas or choose a concocted mix. I had the white peach margarita which was fantastic.  We had the chicken with sweet potato hash and the steak and egg. The first is very unique and very Bobby. It's a little spicy, and it is basically two huge mounds of chicken and hash mixed together. Very creative. The steak and egg was more traditional; you pretty much just make your own fajitas from guacamole, sour cream, egg, peppers, etc. Also good (although not spectacular) because of the fresh ingredients.   Service was slow, although our server apologized because it was really busy. I would return, but not before I try other places on the strip.",

    "text": "Its tough to review Mesa because during our last trip to vegas we went to both Bouchon and Mesa, and comparatively Bouchon should be in the upper stratosphere fantastic compared to Mesa - but I think our group found some of Mesa''s brunch offerings to exceed Bouchon. Which is almost crazy to say.  We arrived, no reservations, with a group of 8 people and were seated in groups of 4 right next to each other. No drinks for us, but ordered the queso fundido to start - goat cheese and bell peppers melted in a cast iron skillet with blue corn tortilla chips - excellent.  Ordered up the spicy chicken sweet potato hash with poached eggs, the chilaquiles, spicy srambled eggs, and egg enchiladas. Before we get to the main food, lets talk about the baked basket you get.  This is hands down the best baked goods basket I've ever had in my life (even the fact that it was free). First off, the jalapeno cornbread was like eating small atom bombs good with sweet cream butter. There was a veggie corn muffin which I can't even describe and some sort of blueberry coffee bar which basically was so good i didn't even get to try more than a morsel before it was snapped up. No joke, I could have just ordered two more baked baskets and been very happy. Did I mention it was free?  On to the main attractions: I ordered the spicy chicken sweet potato with poached egg and green chili hollandaise. Seriously, this was the most unexpected dish I have ever had. The chicken and sweet potato is fused into a sort of loose biscuit with a perfectly runny poached egg, and served with a spicy (but good) hollandaise. I couldn't stop eating it. Seriously, I'd say this is one of the most original and delicious plays on eggs benedict I've ever had. Go for it.  The egg enchilada was a bit underwhelming and dry, and sort of sparse for the dish - luckily we had plenty of other food. The spicy scrambled eggs, were exactly as they sound - spicy scrambled eggs, but very delicious. And finally the chilaquiles, which from my mexican friend who ordered it, were very authentic, crispy, and delicious. Our other table ordered more of the same, with one person ordering the slider-style burgers, and stating that it was the best burger she ever had (she is in fact, vegetarian).   Got out under $30 a person, with quick service, delicious food, beautiful American-style clean sophistication to the dishes, and a seriously seriously full and satisfied tummy. Definitely a must-do.",

    "text": "I don't get all the rave reviews.   Sat at the bar....recommended Margarita was quite good.  However...the older and presumably experienced bar tender would cough into his hands, then grab a glass and make the libation...disgusting.  Guy next to me orders his 'rita straight up...and of course..gets it served over ice.  I ordered a lamb chop....really undersized for the price...and just did not have the flavor one would expect.  I also expected more flavor throughout the meat, as if it had been somewhat dry rubbed or marinated....it just tasted as if the sauce/covering was put on last second prior to serving...didn't seem \"married\".  Roasted Corn something had terrific flavor....but WAY over salted and WAY too sweet.  House wines were not impressive, but of course...that is a matter of taste.  Lovely ladies next to me were nearly orgasmic with the \"he's so cute\" Bobby Flay items they chose.  I have eaten at many of the celebrity chef restaurants around Vegas....most don't live up to the Hype.",

    "text": "It was my bad that I didn't do my research on this place before coming.  Even when waiters recommend dishes, I still don't take their word for it unless there are specific things that really stand out.  I decided to go with his second favorite dish, the lamb porterhouse chops.  It cost a whopping $44 but you do get two big chunks - I estimate each to be around 5-6 oz.  They weren't as tender as I had hoped and the glaze is sweet but it doesn't pop out at you.  Now the pork tenderloin is a whole different story; even the one bite of my friends immediately sold me on it and I knew it was the best dish out of all of ours.  I also tried the blue corn pancake, the chicken tacos (this is a special), and the Spanish chorizo quesadilla.  I would say that all this food passes for a middle class restaurant but unlikely as a $30+ per plate LV restaurant.  But in your mind, can tex-mex ever be a fancy thing?  I love the restaurant because for \"fancy\" fare, it is very vibrant and doesn't have overly pretentious decor.  I'm glad to taste some of Bobby Flay's creations because I do love his shows!",

I don't even like seafood but OMG THOSE TACOS!! the bread basket is also definitely something to write home about - I indulged in a refill =)   The main event was the famous pork tenderloin.

My first night in Vegas, it was late, I was starving and wound up with Vegetarian Eggplant instead of a burger. Not really the same thing.  For lunch on my second day in town I was determined to find a burger and Mesa Grill filled the bill. It's a Bobby Flay restaurant located inside Caesar's Palace and the other reviews are spot on. Great food!  All three of us ordered the Mesa Burger. It was amazing. The Southwestern Fries are delicious as well. So that's it, we all had the same thing so I can't tell you about any of the other dishes, but to heck with it just get the Mesa Burger! You won't be disappointed.",

We also ordered the goat cheese fundido and shrimp and corn tamale. Amazing! Main entrees were spic drubbed pork and sixteen spice chicken.

    "text": "Had a really strong, probably 4.5 star, brunch at Mesa Grill on a Saturday morning.  We had reservations for 11 and were seated promptly upon our arrival.  Servers arrived immediately with water and a bread basket.  The bread basket is not to be missed, all of the offerings were legit.  Service was very good throughout the meal.  We never had to ask for water refills and our drink refills came very quick as well.  To eat, our table shared the queso fundido and the smoked salmon quesadilla.  The queso was very good, had a bit of heat which you expect at a Flay restaurant.  But, the run away winner was the smoked salmon quesadilla.  I strongly considered ordering another one for my entree (glad I didn't, see below).  The fish was excellent and the seasoning/herbs complemented it.  The red onion added a little bite. The dish was creamy, delicate, but flavorful.  Definite re-order.  To eat, I went with the spicy scrambled eggs, which are served with biscuits and ham, plus a side of well done home fries.  The home fries were good, but the eggs are in the running for the best scrambled eggs I have ever eaten.  I don't know how they did it, they were creamy but not close to runny, cooked but not close to rubbery, and seasoned perfectly.  There is some heat, but it didn't blow me away or make me uncomfortable.  No hot sauce, ketchup, salt, pepper, ANYTHING, needed.  As we left we tried to watch the kitchen to see how they make the eggs but we were unsuccessful (I wasn't the only one at our table that fell in love with the eggs).  The ham and biscuits were good as well, but nowhere near as memorable as the eggs.  Mesa Grill has been around awhile at Caesars for good reason.  Well worth your time.",

    "text": "I was really excited to bring my boyfriend's family here- they are all foodies from New Mexico, and fans of Bobby Flay's, so it felt like a perfect fit for our \"nicer\" dinner during our stay in Vegas.   Service was professional, friendly, and done in a timely manner. Any possible need was anticipated- truly top notch. I was very impressed.  Our reservation was right at 5, when dinner service begins, but by the time we left it was getting quite noisy due to the wood floors and close perimeters of the tables. Other than that, the ambiance was very lovely and welcoming.  I ordered the spiced pork tenderloin. It came out a perfect, and I mean PERFECT medium, and oh so tender. I had high hopes for Bobby's spice rub, and while incredibly flavorful, I was left searching for the heat that the server had promised. The sweet potato tamale was a perfectly silky, unexpected accompaniment.  My boyfriend ordered the chipotle glazed bone-in ribeye, medium rare. Unfortunately, it came out almost blue rare.. which would be fine for any other cut of steak, but ribeyes really need to have its fat rendered out to achieve the tender quality you're looking for. While the flavor was spot on, it was very chewy, and not what you'd expect from a $60+ plate. I wish he'd have sent it back, but being a chef himself, he didn't want to trouble the kitchen.  Our other guests ordered the tuna, chicken, and another ribeye (this one a perfect medium, as requested) which they all raved about. Every plate was absolutely stunning.  Overall, whenever we're able to return to Vegas, we probably won't return, only due to the fact that there is an overwhelming amount of world renowned chefs' restaurants to choose from here. This was, however, perfect for this trip, and I highly recommend Mesa Grill for anyone who gets excited by the thought of elevated southwestern cuisine, because that's exactly what was delivered! Well done.",

In terms of professionalism, they are at the top of their game -- I made a reservation and when I walked up, they were the first ones to say my name! -- but it also felt somewhat robotic.  The food really left us wanting.  The four of us shared the charred shishitos and goat cheese queso to start and they were pretty good, but I don't think either one blew us away.    My husband had the lamb chops and was probably the happiest with his entree.  I had the pork tenderloin, which was described as the spiciest thing on the menu and... no.  I think we ate a shishito that was hotter than that entree.  I also really didn't like the flavor or texture of the tamale, which I had been particularly excited about because I love all things sweet potato.  The other two ordered steaks and made no comment, which I don't take to be good.  The kicker is we spent $400 on this lackluster meal.  That's a pretty normal amount to spend on dinner in Vegas, but usually half of the bill is alcohol and we ordered a total of two drinks.  Just a bummer all around, honestly.",

We made reservations and were seated after waiting for a few minutes for them to get our table ready. We walked right by the bar on our way to our table, and they had a nice selection of bottles to choose from on the wall.   I had a great first impression of Mesa Grill and the ambience was very positive and upscale.  Our waiter mentioned that their specialty drink is a margarita, so we were sure to try their white peach margarita, and it was very good.  I ordered the Lamb Porterhouse Chops and my wife ordered the Pork Tenderloin. WOW. That was the first thing that I came to mind when I tried my lamb. It was cooked and seasoned perfectly and was absolutely phenomenal. My wife let me try her pork tenderloin and it was amazing as well. You can't go wrong with either choice! We both left Mesa Grill feeling very content and our stomachs were happy too!  Great restaurant! I would definitely eat here again.",

    "text": "$50 Summer Prix Fixe Dinner for the win!  The three item dinner menu is a steal... You get to choose from some of Bobby Flay's signature dishes at a very palatable price. We were here for Labor Day weekend and made a reservation a couple of hours before arriving without issue. The restaurant is in the middle of the main casino floor, right across from Omnia Nightclub. They have a full bar but take pride in their tequila selection with a wide selection of blanco, reposado, anejo, joven and extra anejo tequilas.   Complimentary Bread Basket - You get three different breads. Asiago Cheese, Walnut Raisin and the signature Blue and Yellow Corn Muffin. They gave us two of each except for the mini muffin, which they only gave us one of. The muffin was our favorite. I also liked the asiago cheese bread with it's crisped cheese outer crust. The asiago cheese flavor was not overly pungent, which balance out perfectly.   Goat Cheese Queso Fundido ($17, not part of the prix fixe) - The fundido was warm, rich and sinfully wonderful. A thin browned cheese layer was all that separated the mountain of sliced, sauteed red and green pepper ribbons from the soft, spreadable cheese. Served with a bunch of fresh fried blue corn tortilla chips, this is shareable between 2-4 people. For the two of us, this was quite filling and we couldn't finish it all before digging into the prix fixe appetizer.  Tiger Shrimp w/ Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale - A signature item, four large shrimp covered with a creamy corn cilantro sauce. The corn tamale had corn cake sweetness to it that complimented the creamy sauce and the shrimp. Loved this!  Baby Romaine Salad (Chorizo, Roasted Garlic Dressing, Cotija Cheese) -  Wow was this salad was bold. It's like a caesar, but unmistakably cheesier. Strong creamy garlic dressing with a blizzard of cotija cheese, there was no skimping on this salad. I liked this salad a lot, but given that we had just finished the queso fundido, it was a little too much cheese back-to-back.    New Mexican Rubbed Pork Tenderloin (Bourbon Ancho Chile Sauce) w/ Sweet Potato Tamale and Crushed Pecan Butter - Three thick cut boneless pork tenderloins that were so tender that cutting through them was almost like cutting through room temperature butter. The outer edge of the meat had Bobby Flay's signature multi-spiced rub that penetrated deep into the meet. Spicy but not hot, refined and not crusted on, no wonder this is his signature dish here. The sauce provided bourbon sweetness with a little tang and heat. This is what Mesa Grill is about.   24 oz Angus T-Bone Steak (Chipotle Lime Butter, Charred Chiles, $15 additional charge) - As good as the pork tenderloin was, I loved the steak even more. The aging and rub made the beef standout even more than the pork. My medium rare steak was served more on the rare side and they had no problem throwing it back on the grill for another minute or two. I had to spread spoonful of chipotle lime butter because it was too concentrated to not. The grilled chiles on top are hot, but if that bothers you, then just move them to the side. I was extremely satisfied with my steak.   Coconut Cream Key Lime Pie - A softer key lime cream with a baked crispy half dough half macadamia nut brittle served on top of it acting as the crust. In this dessert the sharpness of the lime is unbridled and might even get you to pucker your lips. Just know that going in. If you were hoping for very sweet, this dessert is not that.   We had a very enjoyable dining experience here and I'd love to come back again. Attentive servers and assistants that have a good knowledge of the menu make ordering here a breeze. Because it's in the middle of the casino you get all sorts of dress in here... Jeans and tees to suits to club wear, but predominantly nice casual. The restaurant was fairly full on Sunday night but I don't think walk up would be a problem if you don't mind waiting a few minutes. If you always wanted to try a Bobby Flay restaurant, Mesa Grill is great example of his Tex Mex goodness!",

We had the Queso Fundido, the pork tenderloin, and the 16 spice chicken. There was a beautiful depth to the flavors of each dish, and they had a spice to them that wasn't over powering but left me wanting more. Even down to the appetizer bread.   Bobby Flay is a master of flavor and he proved it in this restaurant.",

    "text": "Awesome lunch. This wonderful restaurant is located inside Caesars Palace casino near the Sports book. We were greeted with a friendly smile and seated immediately in a nice large booth...we had a reservation.  Our water glasses were filled and refilled throughout the meal without having to ask. We were also given a full basket of fresh baked bread and cornbread muffins. We went through the muffins so quickly and they gladly brought us more! They are delicious although a bit crumbly.  We started off and shared the shrimp tamale. It is delicious and I can see how this is a favorite of many who dine here. We also shared the goat cheese and grilled peppers dip. It came with blue chips and was served hot. It was so good you just want to eat more and more!   My main entree I got the halibut that was recommended by our waiter. It was the best halibut I ever had. Cooked perfectly and comes with a sauce/like tomato stew that is spiced perfectly. The flavor just goes on and on! Bobby knocked it out of the park with this one. My friend got the pork tenderloin sandwich and crispy fries and another got the shrimp tacos. Everyone loved their meal!   The service was excellent and the place is upscale and clean.  My only complaint is that our waiter shouldn't complain about the Gordon Ramsay restaurants and how he didn't like him as a person. It really bothered me that he would stay at our table and complain. Personally I love those restaurants too. Our server needs to stay focused on our meal and the great food of Bobby Flay. We will be back... but please don't badmouth the competition.",

Big Big disappointment ...i'm so sad to be saying this.  I honestly wish we had gotten up and left at the ordering fiasco. I hate complaining...I don't send food back....i generally just suck it up and know to never go back...  It was fathers day... they had the brunch menu available... kids each selected the blue corn waffle (which is the only reason any stars are given here....the waffle was delicious!). husband and I each ordered the burger with fries.   i ordered mine \"medium plus\" our server smirked and laughed at me saying \"that's not a thing...how about medium well\"  well i know its a thing because that's how i always order my burger at any steak house/burger place.  It was actually suggested to me by a server at a very reputable steakhouse.  I didn't want to make waves so I agreed to his suggestion...but it left a bad bad mood.  Since when does a server make the customer feel like stupid (even though the server was wrong).   food came...the burger was fine...it really lacked flavor of any sort....definitely not worth the price tag.  the fries tasted like that been sitting under a heat lamp...specifically they tasted \"reheated\"  again...we asked for new fries and did say that they tasted stale and reheated.  the server replied in a snarky manner...\"they are fresh but i'll get you a fresh batch\" ...ok... fries came...they were better...but just not good.  kinda shocking that a place I thought would be meat-centric was such a fail in the burger and fries department (which is usually a safe order).  i would never ever ever go back here at all.  I am willing to try a flay restaurant if it's not in vegas.   oh and my margarita (that the server suggested)...was no better than a quick one that i would make at home...and for $20..ugh...i feel so ripped off.",

We had the NY Strip and the Pork Loin. The pork loin was the better of the two dishes by far, but still not worth the money charged for it. The steak was more expensive, an awful tough and chewy thin piece of beef (more like a kalbi cut) that had an overpowering amount of what seemed to be taco seasoning on it. It was impossible to taste anything other than the unbearably strong seasoning.  The best part of the meal was the raisin nut bread starved to us upon being seated, no lie. We asked for additional pieces at the end of the meal to help make us feel a little better about the whole disappointing experience.",

I sat down and ordered the pork tenderloin medium, since that was the chef's recommendation...i forego most of my bread basket because i knew what i was saving room in my stomach for..  At last it arrives, in all its glorious self, the pork tenderloin. I almost wanted to tear up but no, i must not show any signs of weakness...i pick up my knife and in it slits smoothly into the pork...now im really a fast meat eater but i tried my best to savor and cut the meats as small as it would be acceptable for a manly cut of the meat..15mins later..the experience has concluded.   I still remember fondly of that evening and that moment, thank you iron chef bobby flay :)",

The flavors literally transform in your mouth from sweet roasted corn to zesty spice.   Goat cheese fondido: A MUST TRY!!! Literally the best thing I've ever eaten. Burnt cheese on top, and soft gooey cheese on the inside. If this doesn't sound appealing to you, you need to reevaluate your life priorities.

The tamales are on another level in my opinion, and it's all about the sauce. The corn filling is also a little sweet and it balances nicely with the spiciness of the dish. Pork tenderloin was well executed but it didn't blow my mind like the tamales. They also do a mean brunch tostada. Service was decent, price is well worth it for the food.

Surprised it's still there on that busy corner of caesars acrossed from the sports book.    It was a last minute choice for brunch and when we were trying to think of where to burn the comps this place popped out of nowhere.  The ambience is a little dated and I was asked to take off my hat before entering the dining room which I was surprised but had no problem with.   The brunch menu had a few classic choices and we ended up chosing :  Spicy scrambled eggs-  Simple but man they were good . Stacked with raw jalapenos added at the end of the cooking process of the omelette . Not being cooked the jalapenos still had that pop. The creme fraiche addition kept the omelette fluffy . Two  small slices of country ham with a light BBQ sauce we're also a great salty sweet addition to the dish. We ordered the grits to accompany . They were a great side of standard grits. My girlfriend loved dipping the mini biscuits that came with the dish into her grits .   Bacon and cheese quesidilla- I ordered this dish and it was just ok although still very tasty. It was more of crispy breakfast pizza with carmelized onions ,bacon and cheese stuffed inside some crispy tortillas (almost too crispy) . I would peruse other menu items to replace this one the next time we go .   The little basket of breads , savory and sweet was also a great addition . My favorite being the little jalapeno breads and the blueberry bread .   Overall a 5 out of 5 and we will be back asap.   Pro tip -- if you valet at the forum Shoppes valet in the tunnel you can be parked and in the restaurant in 3 minutes . And vice versa to your car in 3 minutes when it's time to bounce .",

Went with the bbq duck over a Johnny cake this time for my app.  The duck was excellent but the Johnny cake was crumbly and just ok.  For entree went with the pork tenderloin.  Don't be afraid to get it cooked medium!  It is nicely flavored, comes with a wonderful sauce, and the sweet potato tomale is fantastic.  Drinks were good, they make a good margarita here.  Prices were not too bad for a celebrity chef restaurant in Las Vegas.  If you want to go a bit more upscale yet don't want to break the bank this is a pretty good choice.",

The tiger shrimp tamale was a celebration of the senses. The shrimp taco was seasoned to perfection. Although the portion felt a bit small, I still think the dish was reasonable. The service was professional and attentive. All in all, a high caliber restaurant. Judging solely on the taste, worth the price tag at the end of the meal.",

The bread that the Salmon Club came in was cold. It was toasted, but it was as if it was toasted yesterday ....? It didn't taste fresh. However, the Salmon portion was huge and it made up for it.  Overall, we would come here again. The price is pretty steep, however, what do you expect from a Bobby Flay restaurant?",

You will wake up in sadness that you missed a dinner reservation at this delicious spot (True personal story).  We opted for lunch instead the next day, because we knew this was one spot we didn't want to miss out on. All those times I drooled watching Bobby Flay do his thang on Food Network, it was all to be fulfilled.   Three things we ordered:  Tuna tartar - appetizer Spicy chicken hash Salmon club sandwich  Everything was yummy, but let me emphasize how especially great the spicy chicken hash was. I was almost disappointed by the sandwich and tuna because of how good the hash was. Tuna was good and club sandwich was good but it wasn't exceptionally great- and I was really looking for mostly exceptionally great. If you haven't figured out my not so subliminal message, just get the spicy chicken hash!  A vegas dining experience wouldn't be one without booze, I absolutely loved the peach margarita. It was perfect and refreshing on a hot summer night in Vegas. Boys, don't be ashamed of the peach margarita- it is definitely not that fruity. Trust me- I drink like a man (unfortunately?). Peep out this spot, I'll come back for dinner someday,",

We passed many eateries in Ceasers Palace, but when I looked at the menu, prices I said lets try it. I was glad to be immediately greeted and seated, so was Dan. We were starving! The waiter was educated and it was through him I found out I was in Bobby's place!!  Burgers here are just aboslutley amazing. I really will say they have the best in the world. I mean it too. There are a lot of great awesome burgers, but Mesa is literally the best. I want one right now.",

    "text": "I don't LOVE Mesa Grill, it would be more accurate to say I am  IN LOVE with Mesa Grill. I have been 15-20 times over the last 5 years and had just about everything on the menu. Perhaps because of this the negative reviews sort of infuriate me. Mesa Grill is not Chilis- yes they both proclaim to offer great southwestern food but Mesa Grill is a big girl restaurant- they don't serve southwest egg rolls or big mouth bites. They don't have a 20 page long menu with 5,000 items on it. Food costs more than 4.99 during happy hour. These shouldn't be controversial facts but apparently they are enough to justify a negative rating. There needs to be some sort of basic restaurant literacy exam you take before you can post reviews on yelp. Wait, hold on, did negative yelp reviews just turn me into a tea party republican? Ruh roh....  Drinks Regular margarita- I know a lot of people don't like to get adventerous with their drinks and if that is the case you can't go wrong with the house margarita- it is not as sweet as you may be used to with many places now putting agave nectar in their drinks but it is not face puckeringly bitter.   Cactus Pear - this is the best by far. Yes it is pink, that doesn't mean it isn't manly.   Appetizers- in Order  Blue Corn Lobster Tacos- Winner. These are so frigging good its ludicrous. I normally don't like relish, fennel or hananero and yet I love this relish.   Blue Corn pancake- comes with tasty duck meat and a slightly spicy sauce  Chicken Black Bean Quesadilla- the garlic sauce that comes on this is slightly more addictive than heroin.   Goat Cheese Queso- its not quite dippable queso but is also not actual gross fundido- pretty tasty.   Entres- In order  Pork Tenderloin- this one is always on the restaurant week menu so I have had more than my fair share of it. it is super delicious. It comes with three different sauces on the plate (for three pieces of tenderloin) and they are all good. It also comes with a sweet potato tamale thing that is amazing.  Veal Chop- I don't like horseradich so I get it without- other than that this dish is perfect. I think the tamale is cheese (goat cheese?) - I'm not really sure because I inhaled it before I could figure it out.   Bone in Ribeye- this is an outstanding steak for a non steak restaurant. Its like 50 bucks- less than you would pay at Carne Vino and the like. It has a really good smoky glaze on it so if you are a steak purist (only want meat taste) this is probablynot for you  Side Dishes- In order  Sweet potato Gratin Twice baked potato  Desert This changes a lot- the churros and any pie I have had have all been top notch.",

I wasn't overly hungry so had an appetizer and then split an entree with my mom.  My appetizer was a huge hit - a garlic, shrimp tamale.  Our entree, the pork tenderloin, was also delicious.  My dad said his steak was the best he's had in months which is a huge compliment given that we're from Chicago and had eaten at Prime two nights before.     Service was excellent, and our waiter pointed out a reasonably-priced, smooth bottle of red,  I definitely recommend Mesa Grill!",

We ordered the mushroom quesadilla (that is topped with a perfectly fried egg), the grilled mahi mahi with risotto, and the New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin with tamale.  Everything was so good!    The service was ok.  Our server was not very enthusiastic and didn't seem like she ever tasted the food herself when i asked her questions about the menu.    The bread basket was cool because it comes with 3 different types - a jalapeno cheese sliced bread, a sweet raisin sliced bread, and a corn muffin.  My least favorite was the corn muffin because it was really dry, cold, and crumbly.  I would skip it.    My boyfriend agrees that the food tastes awesome, but that the portions are too small.  He was still hungry after the mahi mahi, and said he could probably eat another one.  I thought the portion size was right for a balanced meal.  I ate my entire plate!  Overall, tasty hot entrees and appetizer.  I would come back again!",

However, Mesa Grill has removed the blue corn tamale replacing it with a garlic tamale. Please, please, please consider going back to the blue corn. The garlic tamale was dry and tasteless. Also the portion for the salad seems to have decreased, but the price doesn't reflect this.   With all the stellar eating options in Las Vegas, I think it's time we moved on from Mesa Grill.",

The food is overrated and i have had better food elsewhere in vegas. Our party had ordered:  Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash: This dish had a good kick to it and the sauce was savoury but the sweet potatoes seemed undercooked and a little hard. There was hardly any chicken in the dish. Overall a disappointment  Green Chile Cheeseburger: The patty tasted good but its a burger that I could have eaten anywhere and wasn't anything special.  Honey Glazed Salmon: Decent but nothing special  Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich: Dry and the panini was burnt and very dry.  Overall, I was disappointed at the taste and quality of food offered at this restaurant. This restaurant wasn't very busy when I went compared to other restaurants in Las Vegas where line-ups are norm.",

My husband ordered New York strip steak with plantain tamale with molasses butter and I ordered New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin and it was AMAZING!!! What made our experience the best was that Bobby Flay was working in the kitchen making sure every dishes that were going out with perfection!!!!! We had a chance to speak and take photos with him. He looked tired but he was very kind and humble. He took his time to thank all the fans who visited his restaurant despite of the busy kitchen. We will definitely visit this restaurant again!",

    "text": "***Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill showcases several good starters and entrees with generous portions, but the menu hardly changes; it is good option if you have never been, but if you have been to Mesa Grill, a return visit might leave you disappointed with the restaurant lacking the ambition to challenge itself and try new things (you cannot really blame the restaurant though given its popularity as well as customers' satisfaction with Mesa Grill's signature dishes)***  I have been to Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill a few times and it consistently delivers tasty and well prepared food.  Unfortunately, the menu also just seems to never change.  That is the case with a lot of Las Vegas restaurants (for example, Picasso's tasting menu features two courses that have been there forever).  Still, almost the entire menu at Mesa Grill has remained the same since my first visit a long time ago.  The familiar menu has pros and cons.  What it has going for it is that a lot of the dishes are tried and True.  In addition, most guests come to Las Vegas rarely and would likely only dine at Mesa Grill once so the limited changes in the menu would not impact most customers.  On the other hand, the menu feels a tad dated; Mesa Grill does not really capitalize on the latest trends, progression in cooking techniques and popular protein cuts and produce.  I started with their tiger shrimp with roasted garlic corn tamale.  It is a popular dish and for good reason.  The tamale was hearty and had a tasty and moist cornbread-like texture.  The shrimp was good and plump and the cilantro sauce was also nice though I personally would have preferred it to be spicier.  For my entree, I went with their New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin, which was served with a bourbon and ancho chile sauce and a sweet potato tamale with crushed pecan butter.  Unlike the shrimp and corn tamale, this entree was incredibly spicy.  The pork had a rub that had a lot of heat (the sauce had some heat too).  There was nothing really there to cut the heat so it was the kind of dish you get tired and bored of eating (and may struggle to finish).  The pork tenderloin (a very underappreciated cut) was cooked very nicely here.  The pork was tender and had a good amount of moisture, which is rare given the limited amount of fat with this cut.  The sweet potato tamale had a noticeable sweet potato flavor, but it lacked the more tamale-like texture of the corn tamale from my starter.  My dessert was a sticky chocolate cake.  It was very similar to Mesa Grill's previous sticky toffee pudding.  The cake had a similar glaze too--warm and a mix of salty and sweet.  The cake itself was not that great--a standard grocery store-like cake (similar ordinary chocolate flavor and similar texture as what you would get at a Ralphs or Vons).  There was also just too much cake especially given that the ice cream was an almost ridiculously small portion.  Service was fine.  The staff was pleasant and the food came out at a quick pace.  I felt the staff could have been more attentive.  Prices are actually not that bad at Mesa Grill.  Prices are very high, but that is common with most Las Vegas restaurants.  At least, they serve very substantial portions and the quality of ingredients is good.  The dining room is contemporary and showcases an open kitchen.  It is a very comfortable dining room.  Unfortunately, the restaurant is not completely closed in by glass as it may appear.  There are quite a few open areas where the large glass panes do not meet.  Given the proximity to the casino slot machines, cigarette smoke does waft in, which might create an undesirable dining experience if you are too close to the restaurant's outside wall.  There are definitely some good (and even great) things about Mesa Grill.  They have a few delicious items on their menu and most of the food is well prepared.  If you have never been to Mesa Grill, it is worth a visit; the restaurant also feels more worth the money than other celebrity chef backed restaurants in Las Vegas.  If you have been already though, Mesa Grill is not as exciting; the menu does not change much so it does kind of feel like the kitchen is really just going through the motions.  Mesa Grill is located in Caesars Palace.  Like most major hotels and casinos on The Strip, Caesars Palace offers both complimentary self and valet parking.",

    "text": "My review is simply based on our overall experience and I know that not everyone enjoyed the same love. I can definitely understand how others came up with 3.5 or 4 star review.  We have been watching Bobby on the food network forever and I have been to Mesa grill in New York, but wasn't exactly blown away.   The \"Vegas Experience\" far exceeded our expectations.   The vibe is cool, it's very laid back and not nearly as stuffy as many of the high end restaurants in Vegas. You can walk in there wearing jeans and a t shirt (as I did b/c I left my freshly pressed collared shirt in the rental car) without a smug or dirty look from the host/hostess.   The Food:  Bread (off the hook, give me more please) Freshly baked varieties including  an amazing raisin bread, sourdough with cheddar and jalapeno and a freshly baked soft and moist corn muffin  Roasted Corn Soup Excellent smoky, roasted corn flavors, very light and well seasoned. Excellent start to the evening  BBQ Duck Blue Corn Pancake Lots of duck in this bad boy. Duck was very tender, well seasoned and the blue corn pancake, although a bit soggy, was a nice touch.  Fire Roasted Veal Chop The most delicious, succulent, tender chop of veal I have EVER tasted. Topped with a spicy sauce that was truly incredible and a perfect balance of sweet, spicy and tart  New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin GF ordered this one and she asked for it well done. I know, I know, I tried to help her understand that medium or medium rare pork is not a good idea, unless you are visiting a fine dining establishment such as this one. Despite the fact that it was well done (and cooked perfectly considering the fauz pas) this dish was killer! It was tender, spicy, sweet contrast and just delicious, served with a tangy and spicy BBQ sauce that was an excellent compliment to the dish.   Coconut Cake This cake is moist, soft, spongy and amazing! As many non coconut fans are thinking (I hate coconut) not to worry. It's the freshest combination of coconut flavor and sweetness, with an piping hot (luke warm) cup of coffee, makes for the perfect dessert. Had I not given up drinking years ago, I would have enjoyed a glass of Port with this dessert and it would have been the perfect yin to this sweet and tasty yang.   Our waiter and the entire wait staff went out of their way to make us feel at home, to make our date night/pre show experience very special.  I honestly hope that those of you reading this are treated in the same exact manner we were b/c the experience was sensational and definitely wallet friendly, considering where you are in the world of celebrity cheftastic restaurants.",

For brunch, their spicy egg dishes are perfect, especially with a bloody mary - though we will also get the blue corn waffle to share.  For dinner, the porterhouse is a fabulous cut of meat but way too much for a mere mortal to finish.  Recommend sharing the beef and trying other dishes.    What I enjoy is also the ambiance/vibe.

Ambiance: This is nice, large restaurant with a small bar area. I guess because of its \"reputation\" they won't let anyone sit in the restaurant who's wearing a baseball cap or a tank top. I had to borrow my friend's sweater while my friend was told to take off his cap.  Food: 1) Complimentary bread basket that I've heard so much about was unique but there was only one type of bread that was actually good. One was nasty and another piece was covered in a thick layer of  powdered sugar.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mesa-grill-las-vegas?select=mBH2IApgViN1Np3ialqhQg#rni-4X8CehE-8vQMWsTXvQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/mesa...</a> 2) Burger - The patty was OVERLY SALTY. I couldn't take more than one bite. 3) Ancho Chile - honey glazed salmon was the only item that I tried that didn't taste like they poured salt by the handfuls into the dish. There wasn't much flavor on the salmon itself. There wasn't enough black bean and jalapeno crema sauce to give it enough flavor. It was decent, but I much prefer the salmon across the street at Grand Lux Cafe in the Venetian/Palazzo. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mesa-grill-las-vegas?select=mBH2IApgViN1Np3ialqhQg#WQswlQMg3DSRSwFYVSocoQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/mesa...</a> 4) Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash were topped with poached eggs and green chile hollandaise sauce. The sweet potato hash wasn't fully cooked all the way, so it wasn't all the soft. It's definitely not worth $18. I only liked the poached eggs and their unique green chile hollandaise sauce. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mesa-grill-las-vegas?select=mBH2IApgViN1Np3ialqhQg#7rdJhKnUpRvNvbcU15fE3g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/mesa...</a> Service: I only saw our server once. Everyone else did her entire job for her. The place was so empty and our server just took the order and disappeared. Someone else brought out our food, refilled our waters, busses our tables. I would've much rather tipped the other workers because they actually asked if we needed anything and saw how we were doing.",

I've eaten here a number of times.  Every time, I really have enjoyed my meals!  The flavors are so vibrant and interesting.  Things can be spicy, so if you like that...you'll love Mesa Grill!    Basically the food & drinks are delicious!  Service:   Mike P was our server, and he did a fine job.    Hints/Final thoughts:   The food here is really super tasty!  However, the only real complaint is that a lot of the dishes are not changeable.  Given many marinades, sauces, and preparation...apparently, they can't make many substitutions.  For my wife, who can't eat cilantro, this made ordering a little difficult.  They will try, but sometimes there can't be much done.",

I also ordered the deep dish banana pudding which was perfect.  It was not too sweet, very balanced desert.  The service was excellent.",

It is a mix of South American food with a modern Mexican twist.The ambience is chic, but area is roomy (hard to find in Vegas).   Entrees run high on the price range, and they do not come with sides (the brussel sprouts with candied pecans and cranberries was delicious!). Every item was impressive, but again pricey for what you are getting, but then again... you are in Ceasar's palace.... All in all very pleased with our night!",

I had the Green Chile Burger. Recommend this place for lunch. I also heard the tuna tacos were phenomenal.",

I split the shrimp tamale appetizer and it was probably the best part of the meal. I ordered the filet mignon, and my mom ordered the lobster out of the shell.  Unfortunately the lobster was more like a lobster thermidore which she wasn't expecting nor did she really enjoy.  My steak was WAY under cooked from the way I ordered it. I couldn't eat a third of it because it was SO red.   I got the queso mashed potatoes as a side and those were REALLY good...now that I think about it, those were probably the best part of my meal.  I also ordered the pear margarita and it was really sweet and I couldn't really taste much tequila in it.   Although I would happily return to the MESA in Atlantis, I probably wouldn't go back to this one.",

They had a delicious sauce with them and were cooked perfectly. Everyone's plates came out in a timely manner, and they were all played beautifully.

    "text": "Been here a few times, and I've loved it each time. Tonight's particular occasion was to celebrate my boyfriend's mom's birthday. We originally had our hearts set on going to Bacchanal, the buffet inside Caesar's Palace, but the line was ridiculously long. So we checked out the wait at Mesa Grill, and the tables were filled, but they were able to seat us without too long of a wait--thankfully!!! I was famished!!  Right in the heart of Caesar Palace's casino, the decor is colorful and inviting. The hosts are friendly and welcoming. The dress code can be anywhere from casual to dressy. We were dressed casually, but never felt that we were underdressed. The atmosphere felt easy and had an eclectic array of patrons!  We started off with classic margaritas. Not too tart or too sweet, but refreshing. They brought out a bread basket which came with an assortment of cornbread, a jalapeno bread, and a raisin bread--all done with a southwestern flair. The jalapeno bread definitely had a kick!  For appetizers, we ordered the shrimp and grits. It was one of the specials they had for the night. Two jumbo sized shrimp on a bed of corn and grits, with a spicy, chile type of sauce with hints of cilantro and peanuts (which gave it a Thai kind of flair, I think).  For our main course, I ordered the blue corn crusted halibut. It was served on top of a \"warm salsa cruda\" which was a mixture of olives, tomatoes, jalapenos, and capers. The blue corn crust added a delightful crisp to the fresh and flaky halibut, and it's flavor and texture were only complimented by the salsa. Delicious! I also ordered a tamale as a side. It had some jalapeno butter melted right into the tamale--yum! My boyfriend had another one of the specials: the pork chops. It was served with vegetables and potatoes, and had a nice smokey, spicy flavor. My boyfriend's mom had the salmon with a side of mashed potatoes. The salmon was grilled and slightly charred, which added a good smokey flavor to her dish, as well. The mashed potatoes were also delicious!  At this point, we were pretty stuffed but my boyfriend's family is friends with Chef Augustine, and he brought out 3 different kinds of dessert: a strawberry tarte, an assortment of sorbets, and a coconut cake. The strawberry tarte was my favorite. It reminded me of a fancy strawberry shortcake, a buttery tarte shell, filled with a strawberry compote type of consistency, topped with a fresh whipped cream. The sorbet assortment came with 3 different favors: coconut, raspberry, and mango habanero (which was such a strange and exciting burst of flavor lol). The coconut cake consisted of several layers with a coconut creme anglaise and toasted coconut--not to sweet, great with coffee, a must for coconut lovers!  Finally, for the service. They've got the friendliest, knowledgable, and thoughtful group of servers, hosts, and food runners.   Everything about this place is pretty great. You gotta give it a try!",

For appetizers we had the bbq duck (this was probably the best plate of the evening), shrimp tamale and the beet tamale.  The shrimp and the beet plates were fine.  They did not blow me away.  At one of the celebrity joints I really expect top notch creative plates.  Like I said, they were fine.  For the entrees we ordered the chile relleno, the veal chop, and I think a salad, but I can't remember.  The chile relleno was excellent!  I really enjoyed it.  Almost every time the chile relleno is just soggy, this one came out crisp and erect (my apologies).  The cornmeal crust was well done and it was delicious.   The veal chop was also very good, although very bland.  The waitress did warn us about that.  The service was very good and we did not stay for dessert.  This is a restaurant that I would not visit again.  Overall I was not blown away, and I expect more from these celebrity chefs.  When I am spending $75 to $100 a person, I would think that you should walk out feeling totally satisfied.",

    "text": "After witnessing one of the top musical acts of all time, we walked into Bobby Flay's upscale, modern Mexican restaurant, Mesa Grill. While we were ravenous, it was also quite late for dinner so we hesitatingly opted for a few small plates to share. Being the mad foodie that I am, I had already studied the menu and knew that the Blue Corn Lobster Tacos were an absolute must. We also chose the Crispy Squash Blossoms and the Smoked Chicken and Black Bean Quesadilla.  Stuffed with ricotta, corn, and basil, the fried squash blossoms were also sitting in a pool of sweet pepper sauce. My goodness, these unique fried treats were righteous as ever. After devouring a blossom, I snatched one of the most miniature tacos I've ever seen. The Blue Corn Lobster Tacos were insanely luscious. Filled with delicate lobster, pickled onions, avocado, and topped with a fennel and habanero relish, I was licking my chops with every bite. Let's just say if I was into cursing on my blog, there'd be a few choice words written in all-caps to describe my love for these tacos. I'm just sad I didn't catch a good photo of the beauties.

The space is huge, so even on a night you think a seat might take a while, they can typically accommodate you, so don't skip this place thinking it'll be too tough to get seated.   Each time the service has been fantastic.   For lunch both times I got the Green Chili Cheeseburger, which comes with some awesome spicy French fries. The sandwich has cheese, delicious green chili and picked onions. It's awesome and that's why I got it both times.   For dinner, I got the pork, and there's was absolutely nothing left on the plate.   The price is what you'd expect, but not outrageous. It's definitely worth the visit on your trip to Vegas.  5 *****.",

Family and friends that are better than family are a must. Now the food must be the stars of any food review and it is at Mesa.

I am a gluten free girl and let me say I was able to select about 90 percent of menu items!!  There is something to be said about high quality FRESH food :).   Between the four in our party we each ordered something different and had a variety of options.  The tiger shrimp tamale was excellent and I highly recommend it. My hubby had the tortilla soup, it was more like a tomato soup however it was full of flavor with a traditional Bobby Flay kick at the end.  My friend had the bbq duck taco and loved it.  For drinks the ladies had fresh margaritas, I loved the selection of tequilas as the had my favorite available Gran Centenario blanco.  The gents had beer of course IPA and loved it.    Main courses included the 20 oz rib eye, which was plenty to share.  Score!!  It was cooked to perfection and had a couple of sauces that accompanied it.  The cioppino was served with what taste like cilantro lime base a huge prawn and cooked to perfection scallop, along with halibut, mussels, and clams.  The portion sizes are perfect. I could not finish my soup after stealing some rib eye and twice baked potato.  Over all we completely enjoyed our dinner. The staff was fantastic and accommodated my gluten allergy which exceeded my expectations!!  Great job Bobby, the only negative was that Bobby was not there the night we visited :( but apparently was due anytime for a visit so we were hopeful. :) next time Bobby, next time!!!!",

We both started off with Sophie's Chopped Salad, which was very good. He then chose the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin which was to die for!! He had never tasted pork tenderloin so good in his life!! I had the 16 spice Crusted Chicken. That was good too! Then for dessert we had the Chocolate Corn Bread Pudding which when it came out, it was not what I was expecting ... but, again, VERY good!!! I would go back to Mesa Grill to eat again.",

Then we would have made reservations for 7:15, jerks.   I had a show to get to, so I had to leave the restaurant at 8:00. Being seated at 7:15 gave me no time to enjoy my food. I just chugged my delicious white tea margarita and rushed through my pork tenderloins.   From what my tastebuds could register... the food was delicious. The pork tenderloins were cooked perfectly, and the spicy and sweet sauce were wonderfully paired. The sweet potato tamale was interesting. The side of mashed potatoes were delicious. Whipped and airy with delicious melted cheese. My drink was delicious, and I only wish that I had more time to savor all of this.   I'd go back to Mesa Grill... if they could guarantee good service.",

The bread basket they give you at the beginning of the meal is probably the best part of the entire meal; it's full of a variety of cornbreads and muffins. Though I could have been full just with the bread.  We had the lamb salad and the Belgian waffle. The lamb salad was nothing short of flavorful, but I would shy away from calling it a salad, as the dressing-to-lettuce ratio is laughably heavy. The waffle was delicious! Fresh fruit made for a satisfying and indulgent brunch treat.  The service was a bit sub-par, considering that it was a Saturday afternoon. We were left alone for far too long without the check. I wouldn't bend over backwards to go back.",

    "text": "I love Bobby Flay. I have been watching Iron Chef and several other shows for years and am always impressed with his calm under pressure, creative cuisine. So when we stayed and Caesar's Palace on our last Vegas trip, we made a point of planning a meal here. We went for brunch on a Sunday morning. I was so excited, the menu sounded delicious. I tend to ask for recommendations a lot when I go somewhere new because who better than the server to tell me what's delicious? After ordering the recommended appetizer, drinks and a round of waters, we waited hungry, thirsty and eager to feed a mild hangover. We waited and waited and waited. It was 10 mins for a water. 20 mins for our bar drinks. 25 for our appetizer. 40 mins for our entrees. None of the food was particularly memorable so the deepest impression I'm left with is the horrible service. There were only four parties in the entire restaurant! After waiting for our check, it took the server another 20 mins to pick up our credit cards. I couldn't believe it when (after 10 mins of waiting for the credit card slips to be returned) I went to the bathroom and then went looking for my party at the entrance back to the casino, only to look up and see he still hadn't brought back the credit card slips for signature! It was absolutely some of the worst service I've ever had, with mediocre food at a HIGH cost. I will never eat her again. Nor any of Bobby Flay's other restaurants. I only give it two stars because the food wasn't bad.",

We ordered those 3 dishes and pretty much did family style and everything had such a solid flavor. The cuts of meat are aged for 40 days and cooked beautifully to the medium and medium rare we had requested. Service was great and has been the best steak experience in Vegas for me thus far!   The chile verde mashed potatoes were so creamy and delicious too! Everything was above and beyond my expectations!",

Though still expensive, Mesa Grill offered interesting twists on their outstanding menu.  Since we were going to a show - Absinthe - do not miss it if you're in Vegas - we decided to order three appetizers and a couple of glasses of beer.  We chose the smoked duck, lamb taco and tuna (raw) with home made corn chips. One item was better than the next. Note that all of them had a kick, so if you do not like spicy, let them know.  Since we still had some time, we decided to share a dark chocolate tart with a (tiny) scoop of hazelnut ice cream. This is now my new favorite dessert!",

Starting with attentive service, then truly the best margarita I've ever tasted--I especially like the prickly pear one, but all are good.  Other specialty cocktails are inventive and delicious. I have never been disappointed with any food choice, but tiger shrimp & roasted garlic tamales are a favorite, either to share as an appetizer or as a light main. Lamb tenderloin tacos stand out as well, and salads are fresh and interesting, lightly dressed as I requested. Steaks, pork tenderloin, and fish have been well-flavored and perfectly cooked. Portion sizes are large, so we usually share. Even the complimentary bread basket is special, especially the blue and yellow corn muffin that's rich and sweet enough to be dessert. It's expensive. Treat yourself.",

It's LONG been on my bucket list and now I was going to finally see what the hype was all about.  We sat at the bar which was great as the bartenders were extremely friendly and chatted with us the whole time.  It's our feeling that we could get a table with a server that only wants to take our order and drop off food and who might snicker at you if you are trying to split share an entree, OR you can sit at the bar with a bartender that doesn't care what you order to eat and they'll chat with you all day.  It's an easy decision ;)  We ordered the Mesa Burger (9/10) and the Tuna Nachos (10/10) and the Southwestern Salad (9/10).  All were excellent.  We washed it all down with the Mesa Grill Margarita and boy what a nice send-off out of Vegas!  Can't wait to come back and try some of the more \"fringe\" entrees ;)",

The portions are small and I left feeling like I was taken.  Here's why.... The service was okay, the atmosphere was okay - nothing spectacular for Las Vegas.  We had the goat cheese fundido for an appetizer and it was good.  It had a very nice meld of flavors that complimented each other.  I ordered the shrimp tacos.  It was literally two tacos, two skewers of three shrimp each, cabbage, and two home made tortillas.  It came with a side of diced avocado, verde salsa and something else that I didn't try.  The shrimp were medium size - so like I said, if you're hungry try another place.  My friend had the Mesa Burger.  This was pretty darn good.  The star of the show was the French fries.  They had some type of spice on them that was delicious and crunchy.   The reason I gave this place only 3 stars is because I'm in Las Vegas!  Like everything else, the food should be spectacular and over the top.  I'm sorry Bobby, I was not overly impressed.",

    "text": "* Price: $$$, $ 150 for 2 with one appetizer,  2 entree and soft drinks! However, you kinda expect this in Las Vegas and especially it is Iron chef's restaurant!  3+ star. * Ambiance: modern,  beautiful restaurant, casual (somewhat)... no tank top and baseball hats for men but you can come in with short,  flip flops and collar shirt. 4 star.  * Location: Cesar Palace by the casino and resort. Convenient if you stay at Cesar Palace. 4 star. * Meals: flavorful, quality, rich and savory! Not many choice for vegetarians though. 4 + star.  * Service: excellent! Constantly serving waters, drinks. Orders and food coming out at constant pace! Best service by far! 5 star.   This is averaged to 4 1/2  star... extra 1/2 star for their excellent service and accommodating!  You gotta try thus place once when you are in Las Vegad! Is it the best food I'd ever had ... not really! But dining at one of the best iron chef... it is an experience itself!   We came here for 4th of July dinner while staying at Cesar Palace.  RSVP via OpenTable since we could not get through the phone. The bar is beautiful. Our servers are friendly and attentive.  They work as a team... so when our server was busy, other servers came to fill up drinks,  clear the table, bring our food out! Best service by far!   We had Sophie 's chopped salad, honey glazed salmon and rib eyed steak. The chopped salad is fresh with diced roman salads, cheese cubes, peas... A but busy! The salmon is cooked perfect with a bit of salsa on top to give some tangy and spicy taste! Rib eyed steak is perfectly cooked, very tender, juicy and perfectly seasoned... what you would expect from Iron Chef! For side dishes, we had saute spinach and corn. Everything is savory and perfectly cooked!   Overall, it is a great experience... worth to try it once...!",

    "text": "I really miss having Mesa Grill in NYC so I had to stop by here just for a little trip down memory lane.  The Vegas version of the place had a decent lunch menu, so I tried the pork tenderloin pressed sandwich and the salmon club sandwich.  Both were delicious, though I think I preferred the latter a lot more simply due to the flavor and texture of the club sandwich.  The flavor was nice and even though the portions here were huge, the club didn't feel nearly as heavy as the pork sandwich.  The southwestern fries that came with the sandwich was absolutely awesome though.  I could have filled up just eating that alone.    The service here was decent and the ambiance was very nice.  I liked the spacious feel of the restaurant and I think this is one of the better places to dine at, especially if you like gambling at Caesars or just want to eat somewhere close to the Coliseum if you're planning to catch a show there.",

    "text": "This is an interesting and eclectic take on Mexican food. Great combinations of flavors and textures that were delightful to eat. We started with drinks: Leffe Blond and white peach margarita. The beer had a slight clove flavor that finished it off nicely. The margarita was a bit too much on the tart side for my personal taste. We followed this up with a chicken and black bean quesadilla that had excellent flavor but was only approximately 5\" in diameter. We shared the pork tenderloin with brusselsprouts for dinner. The pork was amazing with a nice consistent heat throughout. It was served with a slightly sweet and spicy sauce that brought out the flavors even more. If you share like we did, I would recommend asking for additional sauce for the second plate. The brusselsprouts were good. For dessert, we shared the banana cream pie and the sticky toffee chocolate pudding. The banana cream pie was good with a crunchy praline layer, but nothing is as good as the pudding! Don't bother with any other desserts, just order this! The only thing that could have made it better was a larger scoop of ice cream. What came with it was a tiny scoop the size of my thumb. Overall a great dinner!",

Unfortunately, they gave our table to another person with the same first name. Not Kool!  When we were finally able to sit down  (15 minutes), we found the menu to be quite pretentious and all over the global map.   Our server was neither engaging or user friendly and was not an asset in navigating the menu.  I ordered the Burger which was literally falling apart as I tried to eat it. I requested the burger a click above medium and received a burnt dried out tasteless mess. I mentioned this to the waiter and he said that's how I ordered it. Really, I didn't recall asking for a burnt, lifeless, dead on arrival Burger. So taking the high road, I asked him to take it away and that I'll just have the fries for lunch. Unfortunately, The fires were a greasy quagmire and not eatable. The waiter, to his credit,  said the Chef wanted to make another which he did. However, it wasn't any better.  My associate's had their fish Taco and a Chicken appetizer which were excellent.  Their only complaint were that for a $16 price point the appetizer was hardly enough for one and not shareable in any manner, shape or form. It was same case for the Fish Taco, not enough food for a the monetary outlay.  So if you want a \"little\" well prepared, good food at a high price point, this is the place for you.  Just stay away from the burger and fries!",

I'm an avid food network binge watcher so my colleague and I decided to give this place a try since it was one of Bobby Flay's restaurants. We started off with the tiger shrimp and garlic corn tamale and holy Buddha was that a winner. The masa in the tamale was so creamy and the corn was so sweet and supple. You could definitely taste the hint of garlic as well. The tiger shrimp were cooked perfectly. I got the hot smoked salmon sandwich with the southwest French fries. The sandwich was the size of the state of Nevada. So huge! It was a pretty tasty sandwich although I think it was a bit much. My colleague got the spicy chicken and sweet potato hash. The poached egg on top definitely sent it to another realm. It was a great brunch item. I'll definitely stop by this place when I come back to to Caesars.   My only gripe doesn't have to do with the food. Being. A safety professional there for a conference pertaining to safety, the floors were ridiculously slippery and I gliding several times. The area by their girl is super greasy so watch your step!",

I was impressed that there was no smokey scent, despite the restaurant's location inside a casino. Tiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Tamale - Shrimp was cooked to perfection. The spices were full of flavor in the creamy sauce. The sauce was rich, but I know that this was an appetizer meant to be shared. I ate it as an entree. New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich - The pork was very tender and had a flavorful crust on the outside. I enjoyed the chewy bread and the crunch of the onions. Very well done! Mesa Burger- The sauce on the side was very unique and tasty. I thought the fries on the side were delicious and well seasoned, but not too salty. They had a nice crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. However, it was quite pricey for a burger. We have had better burgers for less. There are other dishes on the menu that intrigued me, and I will be back to try them!",

I went in with my guy and we had a great experience, even sitting at the bar for our meal. Sidenote: those bartenders are on point constantly squeezing fresh limes and shakin' up martinis.  PRICKLY PEAR CACTUS MARGARITA: It's bright pink. That was my reminder that this is the same marg they have on the menu at Bobby's Burger Palace. It's fresher here, and my BF really enjoyed it, but I would have picked the white peach version instead. LOBSTER TACOS: $20 for a trio of mini tacos, super fresh and flavorful. The blue corn tortillas are a nice touch, and there was a good amount of acidity. Wish there were more seafood options on the menu. CORNMEAL CRUSTED CHILE RELLENO: My main complaint about usual chile rellenos is that they are overbreaded. Using cornmeal negates this issue! The chile is large and packed full of manchego cheese and roasted eggplant, served in a roasted red pepper sauce with balsamic vinegar. I really enjoyed this and would get it again!  CHARRED POBLANO SWEET PEA RISOTTO: DUHLUSHUS. I didn't pick this and didn't expect it to be very good. I inhaled it. Subtle flavors, great texture, creamy and comforting.  PISTACHIO BROWN BUTTER CAKE: The cake initially seemed dry, but upon combining the ingredients of the dish, this seemed to be a strategic decision. Bites that combined the ginger caramel, white peach ice cream, and/or fresh fruit were artfully balanced.  If you are considering this spot to dinner, I highly recommend reservations: I popped by on a whim on a Wednesday evening at 6PM and they were full until 9PM. I lucked out and sat on the couches to order a drink and two spots opened up at the bar right away.",

    "text": "I had wanted to eat at Mesa Grill for quite some time. I'm a huge Bobby Flay fan, and I know several people who had eaten at this restaurant and told me it was fabulous. So, when we recently traveled to Las Vegas I knew this is where I wanted to go. Unfortunately, on the night we had reservations I had a terrible headache, so I didn't get to eat as much as I would have liked. Ideally we would have tried one or two appetizers, each had an entree and at least one side, cocktails, and a dessert. However, due to my headache we stuck with entrees, sides, and cocktails only.   The meal started with a delicious bread basket. Mesa Grill offers several types of bread, including their signature blue corn jalapeno corn muffins, and each one was delicious; but, my favorite was by far the asiago jalapeno bread. It was phenomenal. I could probably eat half a loaf of that bread alone.   We each wanted steak, and would have gone with the filet mignon, but neither of us really wanted coffee crusted, so we both ordered the Black Angus New York Strip Steak. I ordered mine medium-well (I know, I know.. the chef anywhere you go never recommends above medium; but, that's how I like steak and that's how I want it cooked), and unfortunately it came out well done. I mean, all the way cooked through thoroughly well done. In the restaurant's defense I didn't mention it to the server, so they were never aware of the issue, but I still feel like a steak cooked at a restaurant, especially an upscale restaurant like Mesa Grill, should come out the way you requested it. I'm not really the type to make a fuss about food anyway, but on this particular night we had show tickets following dinner, so we wouldn't have been able to wait for another steak anyway, so I just didn't see the point of mentioning it. At that point there was nothing we could do to fix it. B had ordered medium and his steak was cooked to perfection for me. I had a few bites of his, but left mine on the plate. At the end of our meal our server did ask if I would like to box my steak up, but she didn't ask if it was ok or if there had been something wrong with it.   We shared the Roasted Corn, which is served with chipotle aioli, lime cilantro, and cotija cheese and the Cilantro Mashed Potatoes. Both of the sides were great. We finished them completely. B had the Mesa Grill Margarita and I enjoyed the Cactus Pear Margarita. Again, both cocktails were fabulous and we drank them completely.   I really wanted to love this restaurant. I had waited to eat here for so long. But, unfortunately, the over-cooked steak made my meal far less enjoyable than it could have been. If we ever make it back to Mesa Grill I'll be sure to ask for my steak to be cooked less done than I actually want it.",

    "text": "I took my beautiful wife out on a date, and since we decided to be adventurous and go to the LV Strip, we chose Meza Grill inside Cesar's Palace. I was a bit reluctant to go back to this restaurant because of a lousy experience at the Mesa Grill in Paradise Island in The Bahamas. But...since we live in the Entertainment Capitol of the world (Las Vegas), I decided to give it another go.   We arrived to an enthusiastic staff who immediately greeted us upon arrival and there was no waiting, even on a Friday night around 8pm. We were seated and the staff was very attentive and pleasant. Our waiter knew the margarita menu as well as the dinner menu like he designed it himself. Very well done, and yes, they have a margarita menu that won't let you down. We both ordered the house margarita with a floater of Gran Marnier. Absolutely excellent! Whomever made those margaritas has some very well renowned experience, or Bobby Flay himself must have taught them.  My wife ordered the chicken, which came with cilantro mashed potatoes. I order the 22oz bone in ribeye. We added a side of the corn. Let me tell everyone, that isn't just any ol' corn. That is like the best Mexican street corn, but kicked up so many levels it makes you forget that it's corn. There is some spice to it, but that spice doesn't burn, just warms ya up.   Disclaimer: I rarely order any steak at restaurants because most of them are so terrible it makes me want to throw them out, mainly due to my local butcher shop and my charcoal burning Big Green Egg that allows me to sear at 800 degrees with no problem. So with all that in mind, my expectations were high.   When I ordered the steak medium rare, the waiter cautioned me that due to the excess marveling and fat content of the prime ribeye, the chef recommends medium, so I agreed as long as it was on the lighter side of medium. When I cut into that steak, it had an excellent dark crust on the exterior and the inside was a bright pink. Perfectly cooked. Perfect.  The steak was pillow soft, full of flavor on every sense there is. Mesa Grill completely exceeded my expectations. The best steak I've ever had in Las Vegas, and I've lived here since the late 1980's. My wife and I shared bites of the steak/chicken. I gotta say, that chicken was moist and full of flavor, not just the outside, but the interior meat was juicy and exploding with flavor. Definitely some kitchen talent getting chicken to explode with flavor like they did.   Go to Mesa Grill. Hands down the best steak in Vegas. Zero disappointments here folks!",

I was seated facing the kitchen and noticed some kitchen staff just standing watching the big screen TVs out in the casino.  As far as food,  the tiger shrimp tamale was outstanding. My husband had the pork tenderloin which was very tasty but there was not enough sauce on the plate to help the dryness of the pork. I had the tuna steak and it was full of flavor but it was so saturated with peppercorns and it's not pleasant biting into those. I also ordered the Brussels sprouts and gate to say it Bobby, mine are better.  Also we were seated elbow to elbow with other tables so it was not possible to engage privately, let alone the lady next to us complained about everything with the food and I assume it was the manager who came over to talk to her but his butt was in my face that's how close the tables were!",

Not a problem with reservations one month in advance - we were seated promptly. The restaurant is beautiful inside. The staff were friendly and the service was nearly perfect.  We split appetizers. The blue corn duck was very tasty. The tiger shrimp tamale was just ok. The rough cut tuna nachos was absolutely delicious. Nothing was that spicy despite frequent warnings from our server while ordering.  Our friend got the pork tenderloin and was happy. I had a bite of it and thought it was indeed excellent. I got the blue corn crusted halibut. Good sized portion, flaky and delicious. My wife's filet minion was to her liking.  We all enjoyed our drinks; sidecar for our friend, cucumber something for the wife and I went with the margarita. My only complaint was that the margarita came in a martini glass and the portion was too small - I had three with my meal. In no way did I feel as though I had drank three margaritas. Just saying...  For desert we split the banana cream cookie thing. Totally forgettable, we didn't eat half of it.  Bottom line: I'm glad we went and would be happy to eat here again. But, with all the other fine dining establishments available in Vegas, probably wont'.",

    "text": "Seriously, very, VERY impressed by everything this place had to offer. I originally thought going in, that it would be very small portions, limited menu, and really expensive. However, this place impressed me astronomically. The appetizer we got (the warm goat cheese spread with corn chips) and the bread basket with all baked assortments was a pleasant surprise. We ordered the lamb chops and the veal, amazing. The sauce and aioli just make everything on all of Bobby Flays' dishes, and you can tell when you're eating, that he put a lot of his effort into what's on your plate in front of you. The veal was a 16oz veal, which we didn't even know you could get that big..and once again, amazing. I believe each plate comes with a special tamale as the side dish, each one is different though. Although I'm not a big tamale fan, my boyfriend chowed his right down (so it must have been that good). Overall, I was definitely impressed by the portions, much bigger than expected (we were most definitely full leaving dinner). Not as expensive as I would have guessed either, good surprise. Also, I believe the menu does change from time-to-time (as all big name chef restaurants do often) but not too often that you'd be upset that you couldn't get what you got last year. I was very satisfied with every aspect of the restaurant and our waiter was also very helpful, he explained all of our questions we had on the menu. We will definitely be putting Mesa Grill on our \"must go\" list every time we come back into the city.",

So she agreed that it was overcooked and took it back, but by now she was pissy.

So, I showed the waitress my steak (now she was visibly angry...at me???) and told her that I'll just skip the steak. I got a lame, half hearted \"sorry\" that was more like an \"oops\".

MAINS Chile crusted rabbit was excellent - serving portion is manageable, plated with toasted couscous (excellent pairing) and fava beans. Rabbit was perfectly roasted and flavorful, slightly gamey. There are only 3 steaks on feature - black Angus NY strip, coffee-rubbed filet mignon and bone-in chipotle-glazed ribeye. Coworker enjoyed the coffee-rubbed filet.  SIDES Cauliflower gratin with roasted poblano was delicious and creamy. Double-baked potato with horseradish, scallion had a subtle horseradish note, which was a good complement to the meal.

    "text": "Came here for my friend's birthday on April 3rd and left not satisfied. Our group was only a four top and being that we are all in the industry we are extremely flexible. We had an hour to eat and we immediately let the server know that we did not mind if the meal was not coursed out. We ordered the chicken quesadillas and tiger shrimp tamale to start. One of our guests is unable to eat cilantro and we asked if the kitchen could omit the cilantro and she immediately said no, that it was their signature dish. I understand if a first wants to add something to a signature dish they would alter the flavor however just omitting cilantro shouldn't have been a problem. So our guest could not have one of the appetizers.   The same guest then ordered the chicken and asked if that could be done without cilantro. The server said okay, however when it came out it was covered in it and she could not eat her dish. The rest of the party that did not have cilantro in their dishes offered to trade, so we got through it.   My lamb chops were ordered medium and came out rare to medium rare in parts. Same for two of the steaks the were ordered medium rare came out either extremely rare or well done in parts. I know that we  rushed our meal but this still does not explain the overall preparation of our meal and how short it fell.  Definitely not the best celebration experience for the money. Would've been better off at stacked which I went for my two year anniversary and was extremely wowed.   Service: horrible Food: good, not amazing Chance of returning: not likely",

Our waiter seemed mildly annoyed serving two mid-20s girls. We are both in the service industry so it was unfortunate he regarded us this way. We had the white peach margaritas, which were great. Not too sickly sweet. Everything on the menu looked so good, I had a hard time deciding what to get. Our waiter excellently described the use of heat and mentioned his favorites on the menu. I chose the mango crusted tuna steak with walnut cous cous and green chile sauce and it was excellent. The cous cous had a great nutty flavor that complimented the mango and green chile. The lady next to us complained that it was 'over the top salty' but she was off her rocker :)  My friend had the duck breast which was also very good. We had an excellent meal and I would most definitely go back. The only downside was that our waiter seemed as if he was annoyed and it was a pain to come back and check on us. We still left over a 20% tip as we are in the industry, but would have left more if he didn't disregard us immediately because we were young.",

    "text": "Maybe brunch isn't the best way to sample Flay's menu, because I left thoroughly unimpressed. My party split the crispy bacon and smoked salmon quesadillas, both of which were incredibly ordinary. The waiter (more on him in a bit) strongly recommended the spicy chicken + sweet potato hash, which I would only recommend if you like eating baby food. While the presentation and flavors were all there, the hash was more of a mash and when you combine that with really tender chicken, you get mush. The creamy grits were a winner, but I really regret pairing that with the mushy chicken/hash. A little bit of textural contrast may have made this good. Well, at least I left full.  Good service might have made this a better experience, but the waiter was too much of a salesman. I'm not sure I've ever had a waiter try to push certain dishes so hard, it seemed as if he wanted to order our meals for us. From this single sampling, I'd say that Mesa Grill does not live up to the Bobby Flay hype.",

Brunch: Spicy chicken + sweet potato was absolutely amazing.  the sauces in the mouth exploded with flavor and everything was just cooked to perfection.  O my god it was good.  the dish is extremely extremely hearty and filling.  i could only eat half.  it was fun to have all the wonderful textures and flavors on my tongue.  the heat could have been turned up, but i am a big big fan of heat.  Dinner: I had a coffee rubbed filet done medium rare.  It was a big deal for me to order a filet, as i don't think i've ordered a filet since i was 13.  But the idea of something rubbed in coffee sounded really good and interesting.  The flavor of the dish, unsurprisingly was very bitter.  But i wouldn't say it was bitter in a bad way, just very different.  The steak itself was cooked really well, so i have no complaints about the meat.  It was an interesting entree.  it might not be the most delicious thing to order, but it's definitely worth trying.  There was also this amazing pea/chile soup which they no longer have on the menu.  it was one of the most delicious soups i've ever ever ever had. The soup's color was also a vibrant green and for some reason green is always appetizing in my head.    Apps: i thought most of the apps were only ok.",

    "text": "When I lived in New York I always wanted to go to one of Bobby Flay's restaurants, but at the time they were way out of my budget. I'd thought about going when I went back and visited, but never did. So, when we were visiting Vegas and friends asked if we'd like to join them for Thanksgiving lunch at Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill in Caesar's Palace, we said \"for sure!\"  Mesa Grill was featuring a Thanksgiving menu, but we decided not to order from it. It would have been nice to actually have turkey on Thanksgiving, but we came to try the food that Flay is known for, and so we ordered from the regular menu. This is what we had:  - Tiger Shrimp + Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale: Corn-Cilantro Sauce - Goat Cheese \"Queso Fundido\": Rajas + Blue Corn Tortilla Strips - Oyster Special: Can't remember exactly what was in these, but they were cooked oysters put back in the shell with some sauce - New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin: Bourbon-Ancho Chile Sauce, Sweet Potato Tamale + Crushed Pecan Butter - Southwestern Spiced Duck Breast: Carrot-Habanero Sauce, Chorizo-Goat Cheese Tamale + Thyme Butter - Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops: Tangerine-Roasted Jalapeno-Mint Sauce + Plantain Tamale with Molasses Butter  I really liked the cheese appetizer, of course. Unlike other fundido I've had, the addition of goat cheese added a nice tanginess to the appetizer. I also really liked the tamale. For the entrees, I had the duck, Friend1 had the pork and Friend 2 and Friend 3 both got the lamb. We all tasted each other's food and everyone agreed that the pork was the tastiest. We all enjoyed the duck as well. It was agreed that the lamb was a disappointment. It didn't taste bad, but it wasn't flavorful at all. Overall, I was glad to try Flay's food, but I wasn't head over heels.",

I could not understand all the complaints about the service... just could not see Bobby Flay owning a place with low standards.  The service was awesome... from the hostess to the waiter.  I'd expect it to be so... I just had to log a good experience.  The food, by the way, was delicious.  My son and I both had Tiger Shrimp Tamales as appetizers, based on Michael Symon's \"Best Thing I Ever Ate in Vegas\".  They lived up to the hype.  I really enjoyed the Pork Tenderloin Sandwich... but not nearly as much as my son loved the Smoked Shrimp Tacos.  He wasn't as excited about coming to Mesa Grill in the first place, but he raved about these.  So,  yes, this is a pricey place... but it was absolutely worth it for us.  The service could not have been better.",

While there are a few nuisances like some of the tables being too close together for my taste and the fact that the bar has no TV, which I like when I'm alone, the food still wins out in the end and brings me back.  On this trip I discovered a new favorite that I absolutely will find the recipes for....the chicken taco's.  Delicious rub on the skewers of grilled chicken, grilled achiote, fresh cilantro, and a peanut-barbecue sauce that simply makes it all sing.  Paired with a fresh-tasting Mesa Grill margarita on the rocks caused only one regret that I will remedy next time.  A double order and 2 margaritas.  Fifth star withheld because they do not accommodate to go orders.  I wanted a Bobby Flay burger instead of room service, but was told it's in house dining or nothing.  An odd choice to say the least.",

    "text": "Ever since our first visit we had been longing for a second try.  Finally got to go to Vegas for vacation again and we reserved for Mesa right the way.  Their food is great as usual.  I couldn't resist ordering the ribeye again medium rare, and it's terrific as ever.  Very nice crust on the outside, juicy meat on the inside.  And the sauce pairs so well with it.  My wife ordered the salmon this time, very moist and juicy, she loved it too.  For appetizer we ordered the shrimp tamale and duck pancake.  But was done very well and very tasty.  Mesa Grill food are always on the strong side, but you never feel food being too overpowering and I could definitely have more.    However, food aside, I have to say we were not as impressed about their staff services this time around.  On our first visit it was fabulous.  This time our server was very nice but not top notch by my book.    The staff at the front though really left us some bad taste.  First of all, when we made reservation, my wife clearly said 7 people, 4 adults and 3 kids.  When we arrived and checked, they said no only 6 people.  Fine, things happen and I consider that innocent mistake.  But the staff didn't show any \"concern\" or \"eagerness\" to help fix the problem.  Ending up my wife stood there for a few seconds and asked \"so is this going to be OK?\"  The male and female staff stood there, looked at each other, talked a bit, and said \"yeah it's fine\".  My wife then said \"OK, thanks.  We will be waiting outside because of the kids\".  Both staff did NOT even acknowledged her, not even looked at her once.   Seriously?  To me it's very basic customer service to at least acknowledge your customers.  I don't even we were even asking for the unreasonable.  Mesa is not the most expensive restaurant out there but still on the high side, so I personally expect better services overall.",

    "text": "Sadly  I can only give Mesa grill 5 stars.  This was our second time there.  We had two appetizers: Goat Cheese \"Queso Fundido\" Rajas + Blue Corn Tortilla Strips and Yucatan Chicken Tacos Grilled Red Onion + Peanut-Smoked Chile Barbecue Sauce. Both were amazing.  I had the 22 OZ Bone In Chipotle Glazed Rib-Eye Red + Green Chile Sauce. This is the best rib-eye I've ever had.  It's enough for two.  The center was less well-done then I normally prefer, but cooking this steak anymore would have ruined the marbling.  Naomi had the Pork Tenderloin.  We both agreed the Rib Eye was much better.  The pork tasted, well like pork. nothing special.  The Mashed Potatoes + Green Chile Queso Sauce were excellent, and the perfect side to the Rib-Eye.",

She had a la paloma (tequila and grapefruit soda cocktail) and the scrambled egg enchiladas with creamy grits. We both agreed that her drink and meal were fantastic.  I had the cactus pear margarita (not sure of the name) and the pork tenderloin sandwich. The drink was good, though a bit tart for my taste, and the sandwich was delicious.  Overall, the meal was a good value, our drinks were tasty, and our entrees were exceptionally flavorful. We both felt like our meals really would've originated from Bobby Flay, and we'd love to go there again, perhaps for dinner next time.  By the way, if you're not into casinos, don't be put off by the fact that the restaurant is in a casino. When you're inside you don't notice it at all. In fact, the restaurant's decor is top notch.",

The best thing thats ever happened to him though, is the Food Network - because I would have otherwise never have given him or his restaurant a second thought.   The 2 bites I could get of our spicy tuna tartare with the tasty avocado relish appetitzer was divine. But seriously, thats all i could get because the dish  was just way too small for 2 people. Sophie's salad was 'ok'. Basically your typical chopped salad...but i kind of expected something with more creative flair from a food network chef.  The grilled tuna steak made up for it though. It was juicy and flavorful, though at the same time, very natural tasting.  The decor of the restaurant itself was nice, but nothing lent itself to making you feel like staying longer to soak things in or chit chat.  I guess thats how it is in Vegas. Always time to move on to whats next!",

    "text": "Overall, I was disappointed by this Iron Chef America restaurant.    Just so everyone has full information, I do not like Bobby Flay.  On Iron Chef he is so cocky, and I bet you nine times out of ten, his dishes will consist of the secret ingredient plus some blended sauce made of tomatillos and habaneros.  But, I have also watched his throwdown show, and people seem to like his food.  And the guy looks like he can grill up some mean meat.  So I was excited to try his restaurant.           On to the review:  My friend made the reservation for six people and they took her credit card down because if you're late or miss the reservation, they will charge you $50 per person!  Needless to say, we were on time.  Bread Basket:  The free bread basket they bring you at the start of the meal was really good.  It is an assortment of muffins, coffee cake, and breads.  I must say that the jalapeno cheddar bread was damn good.       Appetizers:  The rough cut tuna nachos were good, but small portions.  7 tiny chips to be exact.  I know because after each of us only took one chip, there was only one left on the plate.  The fish was fresh and tasty, but the sauce may have been a little bit too sweet for me.  The bacon and hashbrown quesadilla was nothing special.  Entrees:  I though Bobby Flay, have to get a meat dish, right?  So my friend and I both ordered the pork sandwich.  I wouldn't order it again.  The sandwich was dry and just didn't do anything for me.  Very little pork for such thick bread.  French fries were good with a nice little spice to them.  The steak tartar was good, the best entree in my opinion.  The spicy chicken and sweet potato hash was just weird tasting.  I did not like it all, but maybe that's just my tastes.  The egg and steak dish was bleh....steak, eggs, tortilla, salsa, sour cream, and guacamole, it wasn't baaad per se, just not great.  My other friend ordered the spicy egg dish which I did not try because I don't particularly care for goat cheese, however, the ham that came with it was pretty good, but not spectacular.    Dessert:  We got the chocolate cake, which was good, but I've had way better at other places.  Nothing transcendent here.    Everyone in my group felt the same way about the food...disappointing.  I wouldn't return back there to eat.  Our waiter was really good, and the decor is nice inside.  (But isn't the decor nice in all Vegas hotel restaurants?)  I would give it 2 1/2 if we could give 1/2s.  My advice:  skip it (at least for brunch).",

My gut says you could find a better price for a similar-quality meal in Vegas but it also says \"I am fat and happy, so stfu and feed me good food again.\"  It's been a little while, and the details of the meals are starting to fade, but the small plates really shine.  Get the (raw) tuna nachos and the chicken quesadilla.  You won't be disappointed.  Most dishes are spicy.  Some are too spicy, to the point where the pepper dominates the flavor.  Maybe that's the point.  Somehow, I don't think so.  On the other hand, (once we managed to sit -- we waited about 15 minutes even with a reservation) our service for a table of 4 was nearly impeccable.  There seemed to be an argument between our waiter and the sommelier on the size of the dessert wine bottle we were recommended (it was too small, and another was suggested), but it didn't detract from the meal, and it was kinda funny to see the collision of two egos...",

The decorations were fine and I liked the set-up. We had reservations and we were seated very promptly. The tables were decent sized.  The server was attentive, but sometimes way too much. I understand fine dining, but you don't want a pushy server. She was just overly attentive. I dug the way she threw in the merchandise they sell at the restaurant.  It's a hard thing to do at a fine dining place.  The menu... I personally thought the appetizers they had available were mediocre at best. I'd like more of a selection. We ended up with the Queso Fundido and it didn't disappoint. Even the bread that came out beforehand was quite yummy. I liked the cranberry type one.  For their entree's I was happy with the selections they offered. I was kind of stuck between the Salmon and the chicken. I usually don't order chicken when I eat out, but this time. It just sounded very good. WE both got it and wow. It's this 16 spice rubbed chicken with pest mash potatoes. It knocked my socks off! It was sooo good. And the portions were overwhelming. I got 2 acutal chicken breasts. I couldn't believe that! The 16 spice rub was delicious. The mash potatoes were delicious. I can't complain.  We took home half of our meal because we were stuffed. We skipped dessert.  There was no way I could eat any more.  I'm buying the 16 spice rub online at their store - that's how much I liked it.  Ate the chicken the next day - still good, but a little dry. I can't complain.  I'd go back!",

The husband ordered the New Mexican spice-rubbed pork tenderloin and I had coffee-rubbed filet mignon.  Both a little spicy but not overpowering, and perfectly prepared. The server recommended the corn side dish and we both were pleasantly surprised by its flavor and texture. Corn isn't  something I'd typically choose when dining out.  Glad I trusted the server.

The first thing I noticed was that the waiters- all of them- were men in their 40's or 50's. Seriously. Such a lack of diversity is bizarre. Doesn't seem like a coincidence. Our server was nice, but not very helpful. We got the usual that everyone else on Yelp orders: tuna nachos, shrimp tamale and pork tenderloin. The food was all delicious, but not \"spectacular\" and I wanted it to knock my socks off. Maybe since we had Ramsay's the night before, my expectations were too high? Hubby had a margarita, that was probably the most exciting part of the meal.

Fast forward to the finger food (muffins) and it's only making your stomach quake with anticipation.    I went with a starter of soup and wow, this corn chowder is amazing, so amazing that anytime I am in Vegas I will make it a point to stop in and get it.  For the main entree I must admit I spaced and ordered *gasp* a burger (I did and while it wasn't bad it was defiantly not showcasing what Bobby can really do, sorry bro I'll pick the rib eye next time).

Directed us to anfew appetizers - as seen on the food network - so we ordered blue corn pancake and shrimp tamale. Pancake was ok- sauce was much too sweet and tamale was lacking any serious flavor. Meanwhile our waiter wouldn't leave us alone, it seemed like every bite he was asking is how it was. Seriously, let me eat in peace.

    "text": "So I have to start by saying I'm a big fan of Bobby Flay's....shows. As for the food, well...I would have to say good but with the variety of options to choose from in Vegas and our limited time there (4 days) I feel like my visit to the Mesa Grill wasn't worth it.. For appetizers we decided to share the Yucatan Chicken Skewers, it was 3 with 2 flour tortillas and one lettuce wrap. Pretty decent start to the meal. For entrees I ordered the MANGO + SPICE CRUSTED TUNA STEAK, hubby ordered the CASCABEL CHILE CRUSTED RABBIT. I asked the waiter how I should have the tuna steak prepared and she said medium however it came out way over done for a medium, kind of a gray squishy mess :( And there was absolutely no mango or spice :( Husband liked his rabbit though. We also ordered a side of the Roasted Brussels Sprouts with Pomegranates + Toasted Walnuts. My first time eating brussel sprouts and I guess it was the hot item of the night because the couples on both sides of us ordered it. Overall, it was an ok meal in my opinion, a tad overpriced, I believe for just the food (no drinks or dessert) we were at $125. Would I go again, probably not, although that doesn't mean I won't stop watching him on TV.",

The food, service and selections were great. There are about 6 Brunch appetizers and 12-15 entrees available with a couple menu items not on the menu that the server will tell you about.   We ordered the cactus infused iced tea to drink (non-alcoholic). I ordered the Spicy Chicken with Sweet Potato Hash and Southwest Potatoes. This dish is spicy but not overly spicy and has a great hollandaise sauce made with green chiles over poached eggs! 10/10   My girlfriend ordered the Blue Corn Waffle with Creme Fraiche and BlackBerry sauce. She also ordered a side of their Mango Glazed Bacon. She loved both of these and I had to try them as well :) The waffle was light, crisp and sweet and the Bacon was crispy and thick. 10/10   My dish was $18, the waffle was $14 and side of bacon was $5. The meal was about $48 with the drinks and tax not including tip. Another great dining experience at Mesa Grill - Great job Mr. Flay, your restaurant did not disappoint. I'm a huge fan of Bobby's cooking style and find him to be a great food personality. Try this restaurant for great service and top quality food at Caesars.",

Lunch time \"Death by Appetizers.\"  Instead of ordering 3 entrees we ordered 4 appetizers and split them between us.  We started with a few margaritas,  I had the Cactus pear and my my had the one with pureed peach and agave.  Delicious and smooth and just right with the food and atmosphere.  For our appetizers we had the shrimp in the corn tamale... We ranked this our favorite of the four we order.  All of them were great but to rank them the tiger shrimp tamale should be an entree.  My second favorite was the duck.  So sweet and tender with a mild heat.  Then there was the the queso fundido.  So oowee gooey with red and green peppers and chillies so warm with a bite.  Mmmmmm with long strips of blue corn chips.  The last was the tuna nachos.  Bright and fresh with contrast from the capers.  A delight with several sauces that add some heat, served with yellow and blue corn chips.  Once again a fantastic experience, this is one of the few restaurants that we go to every time we visit.",

Spicy chicken with sweet potato hash: it was so good and the spicy level was on point. There were two big about one cup size of sweet potato hash with poached eggs on top. The entree presentation was amazing and I feel all presentation really brings out my appetite. I highly recommend this dish.   Pulled pork sandwich: The sandwich was made perfectly and had just the right amount of crunch from the bread. This meal came with seasoned fries and it was quite delicious   Salmon Entree: The piece of salmon was just simply amazing. It had the right amount of sauce and seasoning that the fish just melts in your mouth. I chose to have it well done and it was just the perfect salmon.   Also, for starters they provided free bread and it was not just cheap white bread. It was home made muffins, mini corn muffins, and different type of bread. This place really does set a high standard because food presentation and quality.   I was fortunate to try this place for free but with the prices it is a pricy place to eat. For vegas, I think its definitely a place to try especially since it from one of the chefs I enjoy watching on the food channel.",

Service was excellent for us!  1) For Brunch there is a delicious bread basket that comes out with blueberry cake, corn-jalapeno muffins, and small jalapeno-cheesy bites. They were all scrumptious.   2) Green chili hamburger- it was great! I'm the type of person who gets it well done and I really liked it.  Still juicy.  I would ask for more green chili salsa on it because it really made it delicious.  It comes with southwest fries which were good- but the spice on it didn't really add anything to it because you could not taste the \"southwest\" part of it.  3) SPicy chicken and sweet potato hash - Super tasty! The hash and chicken in it was spicy and there is a poached egg on top and a habanero sauce which was all very good.  Its like an eggs benedict. Highly recommend it if you like spicy food.  4) Spicy tuna nachos - do not get! Flavorless. Its basically ceviche with tortilla chips but the ceviche was not very flavorful. No sense of any sour, sweet, spicy or anything. It just tasted like raw fish and thats it.  I would not get this dish.  5) Cactus Pear margarita- Loved it! Sweet and pink in color but not too sweet with a good tang. I simply enjoyed this drink and would recommend it.   I gave this review 4 starts because the appetizer was not good. It was Spic",

All superb.  The sauce for the mahi mahi had a definite kick, but the cool, refreshing mango salsa balanced the spice.    We were stuffed, but we had to try some of Bobby Flay's desserts.  We figured we'd take a few bites and get the rest to go.  But the cakes were so delicious, we devoured every crumb.  The delicate coconut cake was filled with a light creme anglaise.  The chocolate cajeta cake was rich and moist but not too sweet.  It had a chocolate toffee topping and a luscious caramel sauce.    Service was prompt and friendly.  Portions were generous but not disgustingly huge.  The meal was pricey but worth it.",

But regardless of my personal affinity for this Food Network iron chef, Mesa Grill lives up to it's reputation.  Honestly, if I just ate the bread from the basket, I would leave a satisfied customer.  It's a mixture of blue & yellow corn muffins,  jalapeno corn muffins, and crispy rolls dusted with cornmeal -- i just can't get enough.  It seems like with the 2012 restaurant week, everyone is yelping about dinner options so I'll write about my choice for breakfast/brunch.  SPICY CHICKEN + SWEET POTATO HASH - my absolute favorite breakfast/brunch menu item here.  What a perfect combination of spicy and sweet.  Topped with some benedict style poached eggs & hollandaise sauce on top -- salty and savory.  It's a contradiction of all sorts!  But it's good.  I also recommend the House Ground Hominy Grits as a side.  Mmm... Bobby knows his flavors.  Yes, I know.. my heart hurts from all this artery-clogging talk of eating poached eggs, spicy chicken, and grits .. but when in Vegas... go all out! Or as they might say at the tables, \"All in!\"",

    "text": "I have an image of Bobby Flay through Food Network as a Southwestern chef. Because of this, when a dish says it is spicy - I expect some heat. Everything we ordered that was described as spicy was far from it - good flavors, but no heat.  I ordered an item I didn't think was described well on the menu - spicy chicken and eggs. It had items in it not included in the description that I do not like. Hubby loved his dish - steak and eggs. We also shared the shrimp tamale appetizer.  The dishes seemed well executed and looked nice when they arrived at the table.  The service was impeccable. We were very well taken care of. Great iced tea and selection of biscuits/breads on the table (we were there for brunch).  Definitely the most we ever spent on breakfast.",

Everything seemed quite similar to the Manhattan version, but on a grander scale, as expected - exceptional decor, trendy crowd and solid menu. Quite overpriced (well above NYC prices), but I hear all the nice spots in Vegas are like this so that when the high rollers get comped they feel like they got a great value haha.  Food maintains the highest standard, starting with the awesome jalapeno bread and cornbread. I got the grouper topped with crab meat and cherry tomatoes, simply phenomenal. Chorizo/goat cheese tamale was a nice side.  My boss and a co-worker enjoyed the tuna immensely (medium rare).  Shrimp appetizer was also very good.",

This time I learned something and made a reservation so had the whole dining experience instead of packing in at the bar ..... Go figure I'm a little slow on the uptake.  Anyway, started with the blue corn lobster tacos.  Cute little tacos with big taste.  Loved the spice offset with the tart pickled red onion.  My entree was the New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin.  The pork was perfectly cooked and very tender and juicy.  It comes accompanied with a sweet potato tamale with crushed pecan butter.  That part was ok, a little bland to my taste but to be fair I'm not a big fan of sweet potatoes and I certainly didn't leave any behind.  I ordered an Anaheim chili relleno on the side that I was happy with as well.  Margaritas were good.  For dessert I had a chocolate cajeta cake.  It was a bit much for me.  Way bigger than I needed and too rich for my taste.  Cake was a bit on the dry side.  To be fair I had no business ordering dessert anyway but I just wanted to try.  As always a great experience other than a few nitpicky points.",

If I can find something without cilantro I am good unfortunately here I think they sneak it in a lot.

    "text": "One of the best dining experiences I've ever had.  Located in Caesar's Palace at the heart of the Strip, this is one of several restaurants owned by celebrity chef Bobby Flay and the only one in Las Vegas (as of July 2014).  The dishes here have a Southwestern theme, but the flavors are richer than what many might associate with Southwestern cuisine.  We made reservations for dinner, and between four entrees, four sides, and two appetizers, there was just one side (the double-baked potato) that our party of four considered less than superb. My very expensive steak was an outstanding cut and cooked to perfection. Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the menu, and he painted an excellent picture with his recommendations.  He was also on top of refilling our water all evening, which after a day walking around in the Vegas heat was definitely appreciated.  I did not find the atmosphere at all stuffy or snooty, nor is it particularly glamorous given its location, but make no mistake, this is still an upscale restaurant.  Expect it to make a major dent in your wallet.  On the other hand, no one in my party left feeling we had overpaid, which says a lot about the quality of the food and service.  Mesa Grill is one of those places you eat at to enjoy a \"dining experience,\" not just to grab a good bite to eat, so make it part of a special day or night in Las Vegas.  It's certainly an experience I will never forget.",

We went there for lunch early on in our trip and loved it so much we returned for dinner on our last night in Vegas. To start off, the service was impeccable...gotta love the knowledgeable and friendly waitstaff!   The bread basket that comes with the meal had a DELICIOUS blue corn muffin, cheese and jalapeno bread and walnut bread. I seriously could have eaten just the bread for lunch and would have been happy and satisfied.   For lunch I ordered the shrimp and corn tamale (appetizer). Holyyy amazing. The fresh corn and perfectly cooked shrimp went well with the tamale and cream sauce. I also got to try a bite of the blue corn pancake (super good), burger (juicy and delish) and pork sandwich (good). To finish off, we shared the panna cotta with berries (yum!).   For dinner I ordered the chile relleno. SO GOOD! The crunchy outside, melty cheesy inside and super awesome sauces combined to a great dish. I didn't want to share!   Overall, I was truly impressed with Mesa Grill and will definitely return every time we go to Vegas!",

I am ignoring things like location and atmosphere since when in Vegas you have to give up on all of that anyway.  At least that's my experience (I'm not a Vegas fan)   If an opportunity to go to Vegas comes up I usually accept it so I can go eat at Mesa Grill again. I love it that much. It's my favorite place to eat in Vegas BY MILES. Even the bread is amazing and makes me cry.   One dish that has blown me away every time is the Shrimp Tamale appetizer. I usually share this then irritated because I should have ordered it all for me. It's so good I think about  from time to time then have this longing inside...like the longing I had for certain men in my 20's and 30's. Ha!   Pork Tenderloin is a must for me as well.   I'm sure everyone out there knows this by now (but if not) Pork Tenderloin is leaner than chicken breast. Yes, that's right, it's diet food. My only compaint from last week was the pork was undercooked. They did not ask how we wanted it cooked and I didn't think to request it as I thought Pork was 'well done' by default? I guess that's not True anymore, so next time I'll be sure to request well done. This is the first time I didn't clear my plate.  But then I asked for more bread and started to cry again.  The food at MESA GRILL is FANTASTIC!  I wish Bobby would open a Mesa Grill here in Orange County.",

I had the New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin and it was worth every penny. The flavor was outstanding and the pork tenderloin was tender. The sweet potato tamale with crush pecan butter was a perfect side for the tenderloin. The portion sizes were also good. I was satisfied and a little full when we left the restaurant.   A couple of notes:  1) Reservations are NECESSARY at this restaurant. We made the mistake of showing up for dinner at 7:30pm on a Tuesday night, only to find out that we would have to wait until 10:30pm for a seat! So we had to make a reservation for the following night, which threw off our agenda a little. Just be sure to make your reservation at least a day ahead, and they will secure it with a credit card.  2) if you want to have dessert, you may want to skip the assorted bread basket that they bring out before your entree arrives. It's hard to resist, but you won't have room for dessert if you eat the breads. They are filling.",

The hubby and I flew in to Vegas in the morning and were starving around noon and decided to try MESA grill again. I opted for the prix fixe menu while the hubby chose the New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin. I started with the Blue Corn Pancake which consisted of barbecued duck wrapped in a blue corn pankcake and it was absolutely heavenly. I could have totally ate like 3 of them for lunch alone! Then I had the Yucatan Chicken Tacos which were also really delicious. The smoked chile barbeque sauce with the peanuts was divine.  The hubby really enjoyed his pork tenderloin sandwich as well. He said it had a lot of spice and flavor to it. I can definitely say that the french fries that came with his sandwich were some of the best fries that I have ever had. They were perfectly seasoned, not too crispy and not soggy either!   The only reason why this review didn't get 5 stars is because the panna cotta desert didn't really wow me. To be fair, this was the first time I had actually had panna cotta, but I'm pretty sure I won't be getting it again. The texture just wasn't very pleasing to me. So If I could, I would give MESA grill 4.5 stars this time around :)",

    "text": "Mesa Grill The restaurant decor is absolutely stunning. The wait staff is abundant and the place was teaming with high rollers and gorgeous people, then again why not, it's Bobby Flay's place, and it's in Caesars Palace. We only had appetizers; I plan on going back for dinner later this year.   $14.00 Goat Cheese \"queso fondido\" It had rajas and blue corn strips. I've had better goat cheese, but the idea of goat cheese in fondido sparked my curiosity, unfortunately the dish did not satisfy my curiosity. The rajas were rajitas, meaning they were sparse. The blue chips were too thin, they broke when you dipped them into the fondido. Did I mention the presentation was awesome.   Next we had Crispy Squash Blossoms $15.00. Filled with Ricotta Cheese, Corn and basil with yellow Haberno sauce. I think I remember 3 or 4 on the plate. It was the only appetizer we completely devoured. They were fresh, crisp and very tasty. Wish we had two orders of Blossoms. They reminded me of chile rellenos without the pepper. Encore!!  Next was the Blue Corn Pancake $15.00. It had BBQ Duck and a habanero Chile -Star Anise Sauce. Nice idea, but someone spilled the Hosin sauce into the Habenero sauce and ruined the whole concept. The duck was on the dry side and the pancake tasted like a corn pancake. A little oil and butter in the batter would have done wonders to the pancake. Nice try, but it needs to be re-worked or change the price to two bucks.   Wild Mushroom Quesadilla, came with white bean hummus and white truffle oil. $14.00. Not a home run, but I would say at least a double. It was tasty and moist. Had some magic chile powder sprinkled on top of the tortilla that needs to be reformulated. A call to McCormick should remedy this. I think a little garlic-butter instead of the chile powder would have earned a triple with me.   I'm looking forward to going back sooner than later. The appetizers were good, but I can't wait to try the steak or lamb. I really love their open kitchen and the action behind the three dedicated grills in plain view for all the customers to witness their food being grilled fresh.   I'd estimate this place does 15 to 17 million in annual sales given the number of tables, the bar and the advance notice we had to give just to get a reservation.  Great Job Bobby! Rock On Dawg.",

Since that's the mood Scott and I were in, it was perfect.  Our bartender/waiter (Beefy Greek Guy) was fun, engaging but not intrusive.   The fried green tomatoes with lump crab was fresh and delicious.  The corn off the cobb with Cotija was delicious and I didn't want to tell my friend how good it was in hopes that he wouldn't want to have any and I could have it all for myself.  The cauliflower gratin was a bit rich, so I was happy to share that one.  The chicken tacos were good too.    I was hesitant to go in here because I'm wary of the TV chef status of Bobby Flay.  But after this meal, I'm totally won over.   Best food I had in Vegas.",

    "text": "Everyone knows Bobby Flay.    In my twenty some-odd adventures to Vegas, I've eaten at pretty much most of the big named places.  So one Sunday morning (which translates to like 2PM Vegas-time), we decided to do brunch at Mesa in Caesar's Palace.  I was totally expecting to be underwhelmed, but this was probably one of the most surprisingly good meals I've had in Vegas.  Bobby Flay is known for big bold flavors.  It sounds cliche - but it's more than hype.  The first thing that stood out was the bread offerings before the meal. This isn't your standard loaf of bread and butter - there are some truly delectable and spicy treats in that bread basket.  Finally I ordered my meal - a chicken and sweet potato hash with a green chili hollandaise.  Honestly one of the best breakfast meals I've ever eaten, and I love breakfast food.  Such a wonderful meld of sweet, spicy and savory - I've tried with varying degrees of success to replicate it in my kitchen, but I can't recommend this dish enough!  I will be back!",

    "text": "Being a born-and-raised Californian, I grew up with Mexican and Southwestern food.  I don't think I'm quite as blown away by Flay's dishes as people in 1990's New York City must have been, just because I've been eating the stuff he bases his ideas on my whole life.  That being said, this is probably the best steak I've ever had so far.  Even aside from his awesome spice rub, my filet mignon was so tender that I quite literally could have cut it with my fork (not that I would in a place like this).  The twice-baked potato that I ordered as a side was excellent as well, but the sauteed spinach was a little plain.  Maybe it'd have been a little better with some vinegar or something, but it wasn't bad by any stretch, just a little plain in contrast to everything else.  The other people I was with had the NY Steak, the veal, and the lamb. The NY Steak was a little more traditional; seasoned only with salt and pepper, unlike most of the dishes.  Very juicy and tender.  I don't remember too many specifics about the veal and lamb except that they were both excellent as well, and came with tamales as a side.  I'd say the tamales were about on par with what you'd usually get from your Mexican buddy's mom; which is to say, very good.  The sommelier was very helpful in selecting a bottle of wine and did not mind in the bit when I sheepishly admitted that one of our stipulations was \"sub-$80 please.\"  He recommended an excellent, bold syrah that paired well with all four dishes.  Our waitress was also helpful in choosing a tequila to enjoy neat as an after-dinner drink.  After tax and 30% tip, the bill came to about $350; about what we were expecting and certainly reasonable for a meal and wine of this caliber for four.  We only had enough money in our vacation budget for one fancy dinner all dolled up in our best clothes, and this did nicely.",

So I only give this 3 stars just so anyone reading this (I know a lot of people jump to bad reviews because that's what I do) can get a warning about all the spicy on the menu.

    "text": "My affinity for Food Network television stars has waned since Mario Batali's show was canceled. Bobby Flay now enjoys the esteem that comes with being one of the few actual chefs on the channel.   Due to an array of constraints - Bradley Ogden and Restaurant Guy Savoy are closed on Tuesdays and my mother's show was at Caesar's Palace - we were prodded into Mesa Grill's direction. Going in to dinner, I could not help but hope that Ben Bernanke et al. would backstop our bill - as he did for Jamie Dimon when JP Morgan stepped in to rescue Bear Stearns - if the meal turned out to be \"toxic.\"   When walking into Mesa Grill, one is bombarded by the variegated interior - blues, greens, oranges, and reds. It seems like something straight out of a Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas acid trip. And yet, it makes sense, for once the food arrives, those same colors recrudesce in the form of blue corn meal, pea risotto, Ancho chili sauce, and assorted seafood.   While my dining companion decided to go with the prix fixe menu, I hopscotched over the appetizers, ordering two entrees instead: the cioppino and rabbit.   At the risk of sounding querimonious, let me start with the cioppino's deficiencies. First, it was oily. Second, I have heretofore never understood what people mean when they said that lobster can be chewy if poorly cooked. Just to cut through the tail meat required quite a bit of effort; not even Fletcherizing would have helped. Third, while the lobster claw provides a dramatic presentation, removing the meat meant that I would have to drench my fingers in the aforementioned oily liquid. Chief among the dish's auspicious elements was the sinus-clearing broth. Coriander balanced the sweet scallop and mussels. Both the blue corn stick and the walnut and raisin-studded bread also served as a palate emollient.  As for the rabbit, pardon the untenable Rachael Ray reference, but yum-o. The meat on the rack was, as always, difficult to access. Floating in the jus, the loin and leg were so tender. After finishing the rabbit, I still faced a sizable portion of risotto. Seeing a pile of peas was a thrill, given the paucity of vegetables in the meal, and to my surprise, they were not overcooked. My only gripe was the bean sprouts' length, which made for inelegant eating.  My companion went with the pork tenderloin. This was a well-seasoned and balanced combination. The dry rub on the pork coupled with the ancho chili packed a peppery punch, leaving me no choice but to lunge my fork into the sweet potato tamale.",

    "text": "Mesa Grill is one of my favorite Las Vegas restaurants*.    Why the *? Well, some dishes are definitely better than others and each dish should be put in perspective. I've heard Mesa Grill is the place for spice. While none of my dishes have been overly spicy, they have been quite tasty.  This past visit I tried the Creamy Wild Mushroom Grits w/ Poached Egg. Was the dish outstanding? I wouldn't say it was the best appetizer I've ever had. Were they good grits? They were GREAT grits - in fact the only I've ever liked. So perhaps they weren't traditional grits - if you really love grits you may be disappointed. But now I can technically say I like grits.  Would I get them again? Absolutely. Note the portion is just bit small for sharing than I would like, however.  This trip, the waitress recommended the Lamb Porterhouse Chops. They were satisfying, but I wasn't blown away so I'd pass next time. I also tried the Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin which are fantastic and a nice sized portion.  I've had the coffee rubbed filet mignon in the past and that has left me speechless. Fantastic taste and portion. I will definitely be getting that again (that's how I rate my dishes - I won't repeat the same dish unless it blows me away).  I've heard good things about the Blue Corn Crusted Alaskan Halibut, which is what I look forward to dropping my fork into next time. If it doesn't satisfy? I'll go back for the filet. If it blows my mind? Read about it here.",

My boyfriend had the lamp chops, with a peanut/cilatro pesto which was amazing also.    April, our server was great.  Women, you will appreciate this;  I was wearing a black dress and was a little apprehensive about putting a white napkin in my lap for fear of walking around with white lint on my dress all night.  She must have seen the look on my face when I put the napkin aside instead of in my lap.  We got our margaritas and then noticed that I now had a black napkin!  I thought I was losing my mind, but she had switched out my napkin without my having to ask.  Now that is service!

    "text": "So let me say that we've been here before and it was great. But this time, not so much. The food we did get was good and the service was good. But only my daughter and I actually got our main course.  For our 24th wedding anniversery we decided to go to Bobby Flays Mesa grill. Now I wish we had gone to denny's.  My wife eats her meat just shy of well done and hers came out cut open (they say for presentation) and still raw enough that I wouldn't have eaten it and I like mine rare to mid-rare. So my first problem was when they cut it open they had to see it was still way underdone but sent it anyway. And after it went back to be cooked a little more it never came back. Almost 10 minutes after the kid and I were done the waiter came back and said it would be another 5-10 minutes. We had a show to get to so we told him just get us our check.  I'm still very unhappy about it since it was our anniversery dinner and I had to grab a bite for my Wife somewhere else.  Like I said we've been there before and it was great. Maybe it was a new cook or the cook didn't care I don't know but the overall attitude was \"Sorry, have a nice night BYE !\". So I leave it with this. The service was better at any of the buffetts and we all got to eat. When we wet to Emeril's Delmonico it blew Bobby's away.  Sorry bobby, Love the food, Love the show's but Mesa vgas FAILED that night. Oh, and the table next to us was having a simular issue.  Edited to add : I just went through reading alot of the reviews and found that most of the complaints from the time I was down there are all very simular in the undercooked food department.",

WTH?! FIFTY DOLLARS? uhhhhhhhhhhhh. she was not nice at all. as if she didn't need my business. which may be True, but you shouldn't act that way!  anyways, we arrived a little early the next day and had to wait a couple minutes, which is understandable.  ordered the shrimp tamale appetizer (upon rec of waiter), and my two coworkers ordered the lobster whereas i ordered the ribeye. we also got a side of corn. Cause, if you're going to try something from bobby flay, you've gotta do something with lobster, corn, mango salsa, and/or steak. i believe the only thing we missed out on was the mango?  the shrimp tamale was....... good and bad. great sauce, perfectly cooked shrimp (which didn't come as big as i thought they would), but the tamale was overcooked - it was dry. the price tag was also crazy - $16. four shrimp and corn for 16 bucks. guess we're in vegas.  the bread we received was pretty good. corn muffins with cheddar and jalapeno, and some french baquette business.   when i ordered my steak, i wanted it rare, but the waiter strongly urged i get it medium, as it would not be tough. when has ribeye ever been tough? -.- so i ordered it medium, but i guess different ppl have different opinions on what medium is, b/c it came out pretty pink throughout. however, it was evenly pink throughout, which is difficult to accomplish, and he was right, it was not tough or chewy at all. the steak was a little on the sweet side, which i don't particularly love, but the spice was a great balance.   the side of roasted corn was wonderful, but dinky for $8.  got to try a bite of the lobster - that was bomb. i should've ordered it, but i didn't want all three of us to get lobster. we gotta branch out, right?   we ended up paying $65 each. i'm glad i tried it, but don't know if i'll be back.   between b*tchy hostesses and no bobby (well, that's not really his fault - he's got an empire to run) and the price tag, it's as expected, no wow factor.",

The table bread selection is something worth noting: Jalapeno bread is a definite winner. This, coming from someone who usually HATES hot & spicy dishes!! You can taste that jalapeno flavor and notice that very tiny kick, but I wouldn't consider it spicy at all. The 2nd runner up for bread: Blue Corn muffin - this was the first to disappear at my table of 6 before we discovered the jalapeno bread.  For my appetizer, I ordered the Spicy Tuna & Salmon Tartares served w/ Red & Green Hot Sauces, Crispy Plantains +Blue Corn Flatbread. Who would've thought to serve the fish tartare on plantains?? Being spoiled by the Blue Corn muffin already, I looked forward to the flatbread version - it wasn't a disappointment. ;-) As for the sauces, they were both \"mild\" (FYI: my threshold is \"mild\" to begin with...) at best and gives the tuna/salmon that extra kick when eaten w/ plantains. I never thought Spicy Tuna & Salmon Tartare can be THIS good prepped Tex-Mex style.....  I gotta hand it to the guy, he sure knows know to make a damn good Lamb Chop Cobb Salad, as this was my main lunch entree. Now, I do realize that everyone is a fan of lamb. Me? I love dark meat (no pun intended!) and some of that \"game\" taste. The lamb was cooked a little too well for me, I usually prefer my meats prepared medium. Fresh greens were nice and crunchy. And they didn't skimp out on the avocado! Buttermilk dressing was the perfect amount - not too little and not too much where the dressing would overpower the taste of the dish.  As for dessert, most of us didn't bother since lunch was filling and we had to wait for the rest of our friends to arrive in Vegas for dinner that night. Next time, I'll have to convince my friends to come back here to check out their dinner menu.",

I wanted to try Bobby Flay's famous tiger shrimp with roasted garlic corn tamale $14. It is not available on the weekend. =( The bar tender reminded me that the tartar is available. So, I ordered...  Partida Margarita on the rocks $16 - Fresh had squeezed limes Good Highly Acidity Drink (It work me up from my shopping lumpiness.)  Spicy Tuna and Wild Salmon Tartar $14 - Excellent  Chimay Blue Beer $12 -Great recommendation from our bar tender",

    "text": "A must-eat-at restaurant. My husband and I wanted to eat at a big name chef's restaurant this trip and had already tried Emeril's Fish House (also wonderful). After becoming addicted to the Food Network's competition shows I was excited to eat at a Bobby Flay restaurant - and Caesar's is always fun to walk through.  We had 10:45 a.m. reservations for the Saturday brunch - it's our lunch hour our in our home time zone! We each ordered an appetizer. The Tiger Shrimp and Corn Tamale is worth writing home about - amazing flavors in this unconventional tamale. Also tried the Goat Cheese Queso Fundido as the suggestion of the waiter - another home run. I was in the mood for a burger so I got the Mesa Burger - very good, the grilled Vidalia onions were the secret to the taste for me. The fries were not as good as I had hoped, but by that point I was so full that was fine. My husband ordered off the specials - a six shrimp / two tortilla taco plate served with three sauces - a guacamole spread, mango puree and green tomatillo. We both liked the mango the best. The guacamole was great on the burger.  This visit to Mesa Grill reinforced why Bobby Flay get's the accolades he gets - you must eat here.",

    "text": "Whoa!!!! What happened here??!!!   I guess I waited to long to come through on that marriage proposal-the mushroom quesadilla is now completely off the menu. It must have been pissed off when it left because it took quite a few things with it. The delicious mojito is gone too, its been replaced by a horrible sour mess, that was hardly drinkable. It tasted like cheap sour mix from the grocery store with a piece of mint on top We really should have just left after tasting the mojito and finding out that my main squeeze item, the quesadilla, was gone. We should have thought about the time we stopped in for brunch and the chef refused to fry my eggs instead of poaching them. I'm not a poached egg fan, but its never really been an issue as never in my life has a chef refused to fry an egg, the chef did offer to scramble them, but it felt more like a smack in the face than an accommodation, because seriously, if you can scramble an egg why the hell cant you fry it up over easy? That brunch was upsetting but our love of the quesadilla and perhaps the strength of the mojitos made us brush it aside, however, our last meal at Mesa was just so bad and boring and just so really disappointing. The replacement quesadilla made with chorizo and artichoke hearts was pretty bland and by that I mean almost tasteless, as were the formerly magnificent yucatan chicken tacos. It felt like food you might get at a TGI Fridays or Chili's. Having a bad meal is bad enough on its own, paying a ton of money for said bad meal is even worse, but having bad meal that you paid a ton of money for in Las Vegas where really great restaurants abound is just heartbreakingly sad. It is a frustrating waste of money and stomach space that momentarily makes you envious of those lucky anorexics who only need a hair clip and two sturdy fingers to say bye bye to a bad meal. I'm looking forward to my next Vegas trip, but I dont think Mesa grill will be a part of it.",

The bread basket is free and filled with jalapeno poppers, blue corn muffin, chocolate chip scone, and chocolate bites...each time just a little different, depending on the time of year - last time a to-die-for cranberry bar!  We started with Pear cactus iced tea ($4.00), and coffee ($4.00) brought promptly out. Always love that.  I had the seasonal soup, a bit pricey at $13.00 but oh so tasty - this time it was sweet potato with a touch of peanuts on the side. Then Sophie's chopped salad - romaine (not my favorite kind of lettuce - I prefer kale), black olives, a few bites of cheese, and tomatoes ($13.00). My husband had the Chiliquiles ($16) eggs, tortilla, jalapeno and cheese. Spicy but not not enough to make you sweat.  They will bring you more bread, of any kind if you ask ...don't files up because his food is so tasty...I never make it to dessert! Next time!!!",

Exit concert enter Mesa Grill.  We've been to MG and it was great the first time... BUT you know about 2nd times right?  Well this put up an awesome repeat performance. They did have a sign saying they were closing early that night?  Was Mr. Flay making an entrance tonight?  Was that why everything was polished perfect?  I really could care less, everything was perfect and that's all that matters (after our lovely Olives evening - this was refreshing).   Patrido Margharita - awesome, strong, no syrups Tiger Shrimp Tamale -  Perfect, no other words Coffee Filet - perfect spice, perfectly cooked.... ummmm Perfect Chile Crusted Pork Tenderloin -  another P for AWESOME Crushed Blueberry Tart - surprisingly light, very tastey great ending   The fact that the last 2x i've been there have put consistantly great dishes makes me give 5 stars.  For those that think i have a mancrush on BF, you got that wrong.  Every time I see him on a television show I want to throw something at the TV..... I turn it off and walk away instead.

So I walk up and they tell me just a minute.  It is like panic-mode or something because one person is like \"seat everyone\" and then another person comes and is like \"don't seat anyone until 5pm!\" and there is just madness going on behind the counter where you place your reservations.  Finally, someone looked up at me and asked if they could help me.  I asked for a table of one.  They said they could seat me at 5:15pm.  WHAT?!  It's 5pm and there are PLENTY of tables that no one is at.  I am ONE PERSON!  I was a little confused.  So I just stood & waited.  Truthfully, I was a little pissed.  But, within 5 minutes I was sat at a table.  I sat for about 5 minutes when finally a waitress, that had been just standing over to the side, talking to another waiter, decided to come over and ask what I wanted to drink.  I only wanted water.  So a couple minutes later, water comes to the table.  I asked her a couple of questions and ordered the Sophie Chopped Salad.    The Sophie Chopped Salad- kidney beans, garbanzo peas, lettuce, olives, chunks of cheese, little blue & white tortilla pieces and a yummy dressing.  I would totally order this again!!  After I placed the order, about 3 minutes later some bread was brought to the table.  There were 3 pieces of bread- a blue corn muffin, a habanero bread and a cranberry (tasted a little sweeter) bread. Then immediately, my salad came to the table.    The salad was DELICIOUS!  OMG!  I really want to go back and get it again!  I loved every inch of it!  The bread was divine too!  My bill came to just under $13.  Awesome!  It was just a little strange how almost all of the servers were standing around talking, a few of them bitching to each other and the madness that was behind the reservation stand.  Totally turned me off.  I would go back to get that salad for sure!  But maybe not at that time again!",

    "text": "As a celebratory lunch for being alive after a near death experience by crazy valet driver in front of The Mirage, we decided to have Bobby Flay grace us with his delicious Tex-Mex creations. Living it up in True Vegas style, margaritas were in order. Ultimate = a simple original favorite. White peach = excellent and refreshing. Pear = way too strong, and why was it hot pink? Everything about this place is vividly bold and colorful. The contemporary decor, the presentation of each dish, and even the drinks.   Bobby's famous blue corn pancake w/ bbq'd duck is a must have. The habanero chili and star anise sauce add a savory sweet kick to each bite. The duck was well cooked and tender, and although a mess to eat, no scraps were left behind. Chorizo quesadilla w/ fried egg was also a delicious starter. Oozing yolk blended with habanero sauce and grated parmesan over a crisp crust never tasted so heavenly.  With my heart set on the spicy chicken & sweet potato hash w/ poached eggs, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I knew it would be good. Two whopping mounds of poached eggs ridiculously drenched in green hollandaise and habanero sauce (notice the pattern?) set before my eyes as I wiped a little bit of drool off my face. I can't recall any other time I've experience such explosive flavors all at once. This dish is a bit on the heavy side, so don't hesitate loosening up a notch on the ol' belt loop. The jumbo lump crab cake isn't on the regular menu, but we were lucky enough to catch a taste of it off the lunch prix fixe. Complemented by a blanket of corn relish and pablano vinaigrette, it would be a shame not to permanently include this on the menu. Typically, crab cakes are made small in size, but this one was considerably well portioned. Definitely one of my more meatier crab cakes I've ever seen. Ended the meal with a dark chocolate creme brulee and pineapple upside down cake w/ caramelized rum, which were both a delightful treat.  Prices are reasonable, but tend to add up quickly. But hey, it's Vegas after all. Planning to check out the dinner menu on my next visit to try the pork tenderloin everyone's been raving about.",

    "text": "I've been watching Bobby Flay for years (ever since his horrific overall clad days on Grillin' and Chillin' on the old school Food Network) so it was about time for me to try his food.  Bobby toes a fine line for me between being a cocky jerk and being 100% awesome, but I was excited to try his food nonetheless.    We went for a boozy brunch on Saturday morning and I thought it was a quality (if not slightly expensive) pick.  I had just finished scarfing down an almond croissant in the hotel room so I opted to go slightly lighter on the brunch ordering with the famed shrimp and roasted garlic tamale.  While it was good, I was a little disappointed that it wasn't packing more flavor.  I know that the description didn't scream spicy, but it's a Bobby Flay restaurant - I guess I was expecting a kick somewhere.  The tamale was among the best I've had, though I wished the shrimp would have been grilled instead of poached or whatever they were - I think that would have really bolstered the flavor profile a bit and may have made me not miss the spice.      Two of my galpals split the eggs and striploin tortilla - that was out of this world.  Luckily for me, my friends like to share.  The steak was perfectly cooked medium rare and I loved the combo with the grilled peppers and onions.  Don't miss this one.    Everyone else had the cactus pear margarita and I ordered the spicy bloody mary.  While it was spicy enough for my liking, it wasn't my favorite bloody mary.  It was mostly spice and not enough tomato flavor.  The margaritas were awesome though - I had orderer's remorse with that one.    Truth be told, this review is probably closer to 3.5 stars than 4 stars but I'm giving Bobby the benefit of the doubt here.",

Before we could even open our mouths, the hostess told us that the restaurant was booked. Then, she flippantly pretended to \"help\" by suggesting the small bar area, which visibly had no seats available. She started to walk away as we stood there flabbergasted.   A male employee noticed us and asked if we needed help.  I told him that we were just looking for a table for two.  He started to pick up menus to seat us and the female hostess rushed back and snatched the menus from him and sternly said \"We. Are. Booked.\"   I was so offended that I can't even put it into words.  I don't know if she just wanted to go home as soon as possible or what, but that's no excuse. I know this isn't Bobby Flay's fault necessarily, but I'm pretty sure this will turn me off from any of his restaurants for the rest of my life.",

    "text": "First I am a celebrity chef fiend. I look for and find all these places they operate/own/are affiliated with and dont stop bugging till my bf takes me.   Mesa Grill was close to the top of that list and finally this year we went. Reservations are very necessary for dinner. It gets packed. Prices are well a little ridonkulous but expected. Their margaritas are strong and good not overpowering and pink! (well some are anyway, at least the one I got was)   We gorged on the bread basket, blue corn jalapeno something and raisin bread and just a bunch of yummy stuff. Well here comes the four stars...it's just my personal taste...I love Bobby, I thought the food was good but the entree selection (like at most of these celebrity chef places) was limited and typically that's fine but I guess none of the proteins stood out terribly and I really wasnt in the mood to pay over 30 bucks for bbq chicken. I'm not a fan of bbq, some other sauce maybe? more poultry selections and less selections of steak by the ounce would have been nice. You can have great steak anywhere I wanted signature stuff.   Well as I mentioned earlier we piggies made the mistake of eating all the bread and when we saw the entrees were limited to like 6 choices other than the 3 sizes of steak we decided to order two apps each and try a bunch of different things. We asked the waiter a whole bunch of questions and let him steer us in the right direction. We ended up getting the two different quesadillas (chicken and black bean and the wild mushroom one) but we both got our own tiger shrimp and garlic tamale. We weren't in the sharing mood.   Big mistake! It was soooo much food! Four appetizers for two ppl and two drinks was more than enough food, plus the bread basket...we couldnt even consider dessert (which makes me sad :( i love dessert but i was about to explode).   The quesadillas weren't huge but they were a good portion I couldnt finish a whole mushroom one b/c it was very rich (cheesy) but sooo freaking good with the mix of cheeses fontina  I think and cotija and this basil/cilantro green chili concoction over the whole thing AND AND a big ass fried egg with a slightly runny yolk that tied the whole thing together. Wow.  Amazing.  My bf's chicken one was really good too but very different less rich and had a great chipotle chili sauce (very mild). I couldnt decide which I liked better though I think you could get through more of the chicken/black bean one b/c it wasn't as rich.   The shrimp tamale.....was.....like my aunt's if she were to make tamales out of shrimp. Yes that means it tastes like food my family could make but that's a good thing. And I'm only referring to the corn meal part of the tamale. It was flavored beautifully not overly lard-y which always happens at southwest places eww. But the shrimp sauce that was 5 star chef stuff all the way. Again after attempting to tackle the entire quesadilla (got through 3/4!) eating the whole tamale was not gonna happen but I made a valiant effort.   In the end we were left very satisfied, aka full and with 4 apps and two cactus (prickly pear) margaritas plus tax and tip we paid about 115....ya it was a special dinner and it was Bobby Flay's place...otherwise ya 4 apps..100 bucks!...ok well 25 of it is two drink but still! you get the point.   But you gotta try this place!",

The waitress knew her product and made several valid suggestions. The wine list was not large but sufficiently diverse to serve almost any taste. We chose a mid priced French pinot noir which was well received.  Cocktails at $15 + were pricey but good quality. Our starters of soup, salads and shrimp were unremarkable but no complaints. The entrees varied from lamb to crusted tuna and were generous portions without the need for sides. I personally chose the tuna and requested as rare as possible - I wasn't disappointed.  With coffee for all and one desert, our bill was $375 plus tip. The $100 coupon I was using was rather loudly announced to my guests which I didn't appreciate.    Overall, a pleasant dinner but I felt a little rushed for a restaurant of this quality.",

I ordered two side dishes, mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts. The potatoes were runny but had an excellent cheese flavoring. The sprouts were amazing-roasted on the outside which created a caramelized surface with the pomegranates and a smoky flavor.   The server was friendly but not available as much as you'd like. I suppose it was busy, but could have been anticipated on a Ricky Martin Saturday night. Incidentally, the bread service did not come out for a while, although the jalapeno slice made it worth the wait.  I was not impressed by dessert. I had the coconut cake, and at least when I was a kid, light and fluffy was the way to go. This cake was soggy and cold-I don't get it.  I paid a fortune for the privilege, but the crowd suggests this won't change soon.",

    "text": "Note:  My experience was limited to the Restaurant Week Menu only.  First of all, I kind of hate Bobby Flay.   He just has a very punchable face.  Anyways, I digress...yes...Mesa Grill.    I'm a bit embarassed to say that I liked Mesa Grill (I still hate you, Bobby).  It wasn't fantastic, but, pretty, pretty, pretty good.  3.5 stars.  My restaurant week menu included the following: (1) blue corn pancake with bbq duck; (2) the New Mexico spice-rubbed pork tenderloin with sweet potato tamale; and (3) mango buttermilk upside-down cake.  I also ordered a prickly pear margarita.  The bbq duck in the blue corn pancake was a bit sweet for me; I found myself struggling to finish it.  Probably wouldn't order it again.  The pork tenderloin entree include three huge portions of perfectly cooked, moist pork slabs.  Awesome.  Unfortunately, the sweet potato tamale that accompanied the pork (and impossible to open) was really dry and added nothing to the dish.  The mango buttermilk upside-down cake dessert was okay but was elevated to good by the delicious rum caramel glaze topping the cake and mango ice cream.  My prickly pear margarita was good but a tad sweet.  I probably prefer a more traditional margarita.  My boyfriend ordered the restaurant week menu with roasted corn soup,  Yucatan-style grouper, and key lime pie.  I took bites of his food and wished I had ordered his menu.  So, if you decide to try the Restaurant Week menu, I'd recommend you order his choice of dishes.  Bonus points to Bobby for not including any kokopelis or pictures of cacti in his restaurant.  I still hate it when you win throwdown.  That is all.",

Entree was the cornmeal chile relleno which I had last time and this was even better (the only vegetarian entree) stuffed with roasted eggplant and manchego cheese on top of a delicious red pepper sauce.  Finished with the pear buttermilk upside down cake that tasted like christmas, and the deep dish banana cream pie which is exactly as it sounds. Both perfect desserts.  Oh and about 5 glasses of their cactus pear iced tea.",

I had the new york strip steak. A solid steak, but nothing fancy. You're Bobby Flay, you're supposed to bring some heat or something like that. The house sauce with the steak was a nice touch. Maybe you're just trying to keep it simple.  The girlflriend had a Cornmeal Crusted Chile Relleno, with roasted eggplant, manchego cheese, sweet red pepper sauce and balsamic vinegar. It tasted like a \"Hot Mess\", which is not the \"Heat\" we were looking for.  Sides:  Smoked Chile Collard Greens; mashed potatoes w/ green chile queso sauce. Two thumbs up for the Mashed potatoes. But the collard greens weren't very smoky, weren't very spicy, and were just kind of mushy. Really underwhelming.  So all you aspiring Mesa Grill patrons, ask yourself this: are you ready for a Let Down?",

    "text": "Sooooo, my lovely girlfriend and I decided to check this place out.    It was pretty much what I had expected from a well known chef.   We had the concierge make our reservation for us, and arrived a little earlier than we had expected.  This was apparently no problem, as we were seated immediately.  Our waitress was pleasant and explained everything to us fairly promptly after we sat down.   I ordered the pork tenderloin and my sweetheart had the Stuffed pepper.  We were probably expecting to wait a little bit for our food to arrive after ordering, but surprisingly we were served somewhat quickly.  I'd say within about 10 minutes of ordering our food, it was sitting in front of us.  Both of our entrees were really well prepared and very tasty.   If I had to complain about anything, it would be the ice cubes.  I had expected that maybe for once (in vegas) that when I ordered up a bourbon on the rocks, I'd actually, finally see a real ice cube. Especially in a restaurant where people are supposed to know about these things.  It was pretty disappointing to have three slivers of ice, that had basically melted by the time I was served.  Honestly I'm only really complaining about it since on the dessert and drink menu they list a glass of a nice bourbon for $35.  I feel like if you were to order the higher end stuff as an after dinner drink, you would be pretty disappointed if you ordered it on the rocks.  I know that this is a small detail to most, but I think many people that drink scotch or bourbon would agree.  If you're ordering a drink on the rocks, there is a reason for it.    Overall the experience was great, and I would definitely stop her again sometime, though I think maybe for lunch, and hit up someplace a bit more high end for dinner.",

We went for lunch, restaurant had a 30 minute wait.  We ordered: Mesa grill margarita. Very good Corn tamale with shrimp.  Good but not blown away..  Green chile burger....good burger but no spice, could not taste the chile Pork tenderloin sandwich. Bread was a bit burnt,  bland Fries with both sandwiches...best thing we had,crispy  We did not get a bread basket..I feel a bit cheated..by the time I realized no bread we were done eating.  Service was okay. But not getting the bread , I have to deduct a star.. I really wanted to be impressed but was disappointed.",

I just sat at the bar but tried different things on the menu. The service was attentive, professional and friendly, and above all, the food was very  very good (and I can be picky about dining out!).  I am big fan of carefully crafted cuisine, and the food at Mesa was one of the best I've had in a long time. Looking fw to going back.",

I was very pleasantly surprised, the staff were great, very knowledgeable and very welcoming.   The food was delicious, we had the Ahi Tuna and the green pepper cioppino as well as the brussels sprouts as a side dish. Being a big lover of good cioppino the green pepper base really intrigued me, venturing out of the traditional tomato base, and it was brilliant! I do not know how to describe it without not doing it justice so I will just say go eat it, it is the best cioppino I have ever had, the fish, scallops, and lobster that were in it were cooked perfectly and the green pepper broth was so delicious, so so delicious! Aside from the cioppino the Tuna was also very good, and the brussels sprouts were cooked with pomegrante seeds which was seriously tasty.   All in all, when in vegas there are a ton of options to eat at, but you should eat here!",

    "text": "Corn soup - oh my yum. And I really liked the chile relleno. Say yes to the Margarita and the bread!  That said, here's a bit more detail: The corn soup was creamy - crunchy (not sure what was in it, but it gave it a great texture) and delish! Perfect - could eat it all day. Margarita - also perfection, and their was a variety of bread - sweet and savory.   After all this, I did still have room for my Chile Relleno. The breading was a little too hard / crunchy in my opinion, but it wasn't so off-putting that I didn't thoroughly enjoy what was underneath.   We did not get dessert - the coconut cake was being touted as the \"specialty\".  And that's where I think the negative is with Mesa Grill - there was far too much \"this is our specialty\" for every course. The menu is not overly huge, and I find it a little cheesy to be telling people what to choose (unless they ask!). I did not choose any of the \"specialties\" and I thought my choices were perfect. Also, the service was a bit too fast. It was fine, but it felt very much like there was a focus on turning tables as quickly as possible. Ambiance was typical of a Vegas celeb restaurant - in this case, very open and comfortable seating arrangements.  I would go back for sure. I might even order the same thing, and perhaps try dessert!",

The pork tenderloin was very perfect and tender, but it's a bit on the spicy side, so only get it if you like it with a kick.  After that, we were full, so we didn't get to try dessert.

The cheese appetizer was delicious anything with goat cheese is a winner for me.   Other hits amoung the table were the chicken, salmon, and pork tenderloin.  We finished the night with churros which had awesome dipping sauces.  Can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "Whenever I'm in Vegas I just have to say that there are few times I'm able to wake up early enough to go anywhere for breakfast or lunch, especially on a Sunday. BUT I WILL make an exception for this restaurant. Hopefully that speaks volumes.   This restaurant (owned by Bobby Flay) is located on the casino floor of Caesar's Palace. It's easy to miss unless you're really looking for it. I feel like this restaurant is underrated and can be easily overshadowed by the many restaurants that Caesar's Palace offers.   One of the main reasons why I come here is the breakfast/brunch menu. I seriously cannot get enough of their Smoked Salmon and Dill Quesadilla. It has the perfect amount of smoked salmon and cheese and the creme fraiche is delicious. Their Tiger Shrimp and Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale is fantastic as well as their Wild Striped Bass and Ancho Chile-Honey Glazed Salmon. I would definitely like to try the Scrambled Eggs Chilaquiles (a somewhat new discovery from my Mexican friends) and the Spicy Scrambled Eggs. As if you couldn't already tell I'm a sucker for spicy foods...as well as smoked salmon. I was also told that the Blue Corn Buttermilk Waffle is to die for as well.   I honestly haven't had anything that doesn't taste good at this restaurant. The service is prompt and attentive, the drinks are great, and the food is fantastic. I haven't had a complaint yet. Try this place out and you won't be disappointed! Good job, Bobby Flay!",

The decor was nice, not too loud like most other Vegas establishments. The brussels sprout salad was great. The pork chop was amazing and the churro for dessert was the piece de resistance.   It was well worth it. It was a very good meal and Mr Bobby Flay has another winner here.",

    "text": "I wasn't expecting much from this restaurant because famous chef's restaurants tend to be a let down. However, Mesa grill was an exception. The service was friendly and quick, the food phenomenal, the drinks so-so.  The food:  Bread basket was filled with walnut bread, asiago cheese bread, and blue corn muffins. All were tasty, but the corn muffin was crumbly.  Appetizer: shrimp tamale! Omg! The shrimp were perfectly cooked and enrobbed in a cream sauce. The Masa dough tasted like delicious corn bread with a hint of sweetness.  Entrees: seared tuna over a bed of the best couscous I have ever eaten. It was buttery and the right amount of salty. It contained toasted pine nuts that added the perfect crunch. My Sig other ordered the spice rubbed chicken served with cilantro mashed potatoes. The meat was perfectly cooked: tender and juicy. My Sig other's mother ordered the ribeye which came with flays signature adobo sauces. The sauces were winners: perfectly tangy and sweet and hot. Incredibly balanced.  Dessert: I ordered the pistachio brown butter cake with strawberry ice cream. Omg! The ice cream was some of the best I have ever had. It tasted like concentrated strawberries. I usually only like cookie or candy ice creams, but this was so smooth and creamy. The cake itself was moist and rich. I don't regret those calories at all. My sig other's mom had the coconut tres leches cake--it was rich and decadent but at the same time light.   Drinks: nothing to write home about. I was expecting something a little more playful from Bobby flay. Maybe some spicy cocktails.   In sum: go to this restaurant! You will have a memorable meal.",

I don't eat meat, my menu options were pretty limited but it did not disappoint.

    "text": "**breakfast review**  I had absolutely no expectations at Bobby Flay's Mesa Grll, I don't follow his TV persona or his shows. All I know is that he grills and invades peoples' restaurants for a challenge, how freakin' humble.. But I could honestly say this is one of the best breakfast (or actually brunch) places I've had in a very long time!  I started off my brunch with a Spicy Bloody Mary, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=g_DhgA5vwnDyojJ5hAg00Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbu...</a> Honestly not worth the $9, but I appreciated the unique olive & chile pepper on the side, and the drink didn't taste like straight up tomato juice + vodka, there were a lot of spices in there!  Warning, it was quite spicy for a morning drink. I thought \"Hey~~~ Whatever, I'm in Vegas,\"  but boy, did it kick my @ss that morning.   Their impressive \"bread basket\" is breakfast alone! <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=Sy-fdjtW7Drd-6LBJ-i3ww\">yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbu...</a>  You must get the one and only soup Mesa Grill serves, the Grilled Corn Soup. Delicious and the consistency reminded me of soupier porridge, which made me feel warm and homey :*) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=0UI-AK7kH_DvUWgjOce34g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbu...</a>  I admit I was regretful while ordering a salmon dish while Mesa is known for Tex Mex, but my Honey Glazed Salmon w/ black bean sauce was amazing. You can request the salmon medium or even medium rare! <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=Wz2EFRR4Kt-uZfR6WPjoPg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbu...</a>  My girlfriends also ordered other breakfast staples like a Sweet Potato Hash (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=u4pq7PFOPYytWEhfxCxQ0w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbu...</a>) and the Jalapeno scrambled eggs with Ham (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=8YIzCO87s62KyKgqNedm5g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbu...</a>). I can easily say these dishes were impressively satisfying breakfast dishes, and definitely exceeded my expectations.  BREAKFAST FOOD SUCCESS!",

So delicious I went back the next day to eat there again despite all the Vegas food options.  In total, I had a brunch and a dinner there.  The decor is great too: modern, colorful, with a semi-open kitchen.  Of particular note were: the chilaquiles, which were full of flavor and the perfect combination of crispy and soft; the tamales, which were really well steamed/moist, and delicious; and, my favorite, the brussells sprouts, which were unexpected and superbly conceived and executed.  The drinks were well made too.  I also wrote a review for the NY Mesa Grill, which pales in comparison to the Vegas outpost.  So if you're in Vegas and thinking, \"well, I'll just go to the one in New York when I'm there next (or when I get home, or whatever),\" don't pass the opportunity up to head over to Caesar's and eat at this one instead.",

Ok, I thought, let's see what you got Bobby Flay....  First of all, to my disappointment, only the brunch menu was available (at 1pm? really?).  Ok, it's Vegas I guess.    First they bring you a bread basket w/ a nice assortment...poppyseed blueberry muffin, cornbread w/ jalapeno, a crumbcake, etc.  Great while you are waiting for your appetizers/entrees.  I ordered the ANCHO CHILE-HONEY GLAZED SALMON with Spicy Black Bean Sauce and Roasted Jalapeno Crema...this was really good.  The flavors came together really well.    The BF had the cuban sandwich w/ adobo fries.  The fries were really good.  The sandwich was ok.  I was basically disappointed b/c I expected better.  I would have preferred to come here for lunch or dinner...much more choices.  Also pricey.  We were also warned that all of the dishes were \"spicy\" b/c that is Bobby Flay's style, BUT it wasn't spicy at all.  Some spice would have been nice  :-)  I would give this place another try....for dinner.",

Many of the other \"famous chef\" restaurants in town suffer from quality let-downs.  Bobby Flay's Mesa is the one exception to this.   I have been to this place five times now in the past 5 years and it always wows me.  My two favorite appetizers are the tiger shrimp and corn tamale (a wonderful combination), and the blue corn pancake with BBQ duck.  For entrees, you can't go wrong with the spice rubbed pork tenderloin - very tasty and tender, with a bit of zing.  The fresh fish is also good.  On my last trip we had the grilled dorado - which was tender and flavorful.  For sides, you have to try the grilled brussels sprouts with toasted pecans - even if you don't like brussels sprouts, you'll like these.",

    "text": "Like others, I had really looked forward to eating here.  I was not thrilled I had to leave a credit card with my reservation, but got over it.   Lovely decor, but nothing spectacular. Having been in Vegas and eaten here at some other celebrity chef restaurants, I was expecting the high prices.  The food did live up to my expectations here.  Big, bold flavors (I had the pork, others at my table had the veal chop and the venison, and the same for those), perfectly cooked pork, delicious tamales, although a little sweet, went well with the very spicy pork and delicious sauce.  Portions were great here, almost too much.  Unlike the apps - small portions big prices.  Duck \"taco\" - 1 small blue corn soft tortilla with about 3 tablespoons of duck -$16.00.  Hard to share with 3 other people - about a tiny bite each! Hard for me to understand the price,although it was tasty.  The corn tamale with shrimp was delicious, a little better portion, but was described as having 4 jumbo shrimp - they were hardly jumbo, although we each did get one, and the flavors were good. Again, overpriced at $14 or $16 I can't remember. Biggest disappointment was service.  Friendly and knowledgeable, yes. We ordered a pretty pricey bottle of wine, and when we ordered apps and told the waiter we would like to hold off on entrees for a few minutes, he basically informed us that we had to order everything at once, they were busy, yada yada yada.  There are few things that aggravate me more at a high end restaurant than when they dictate when I have to order what.  What is this, Dennys?  They can't manage a simple delay of ordering entrees?  Mostly, i just felt they were rushing us so they could fill up our table again.  Big no,no for me.   If you are a Bobby Flay fan, and want ot see how close you come to making his food at home, eating here is a must. (It's not that hard to duplicate his recipes, they are fairly easy, and from this experience I see I can do it spot on).  The real True test for me of any restaurant is would I go back? Nope!  There is a lot of great places in Vegas I would go back to, and have, BUT this is not one of them.  Easily duplicated, and very pricey, combined with Dennys mentality on the service make it a ONE TIME ONLY EXPERIENCE.",

My expectations were low, as most celebrity chefs' restaurants are more fluff than substance, but I was cautiously optimistic. We were pleasantly surprised.  The white peach margaritas were very refreshing and refreshingly strong, especially after not realizing our reservation was made on a fight night. Both Caesar's garage and valet were full, and we ended up having to use the self park at Mirage and walk all the way through there and the Forum Shops.  She had the blue corn pancake appetizer, and I had the cornmeal chile relleno side. The sauces drizzled over the top looked the same, and I'm still not convinced they weren't. For entrees, she had the spiced pork tenderloin, which came in three \"medallions\" that were about 2 1/2\" thick, and perfectly cooked. Mine was the fire roasted veal chop, which, while a little fatty, was very flavorful. The sage tamale was just how I wanted it to be: PACKED with sage.  We'd definitely eat there again, but I'd be more inclined to go on a weeknight when there are fewer people around, and go earlier so we wouldn't hit the pre-club crowd. Although, given what the bill came to, we might just buy the cookbook instead.",

I had been crushing Corona's all day so I decided to go with another and was quite pleased as it went well with the tex-mex style dishes. For apps we ordered the tuna and salmon tartare and duck pancake. The tartares were good but the duck pancake was straight rediculous. Both were topped with a delicously smoky brown sauce.   For dinner I got the Cioppino which is a great variety of seafood. It contained a lobster tail, lobster claw, mussels, scallops, and halibut. It was on point. My friend got the bone in ribeye which was even better. It contained a salsa on top and two sauces on the side. All of which made me want to rip of my shirt and rub on my chest and belly. It was so good that my buddy gnawed on the bone for a few minutes which,  although socially inacceptable, was one of the better decisions hes ever made.",

My girlfriend was dissapointed by the pumpkin soup because it tasted a lot like pumpkin pie mix.    For the lunch entree, we ordered the Mesa Burger and the Sixteen Spice Chicken salad.  The burger itself wasn't memorable because...I really can't remember what it tasted like, but I loved dipping the fries into the horseradish sauce that came with the burger.  The salad disappointed my companion; the leaves were whole and were as big as your head and the dressing wasn't that great either.",

My friends and I got a great circular booth in the corner after waiting only 10 minutes for a table. I ordered the tuna steak which I thought should have been a little more spicy and lacked some taste. The polenta which was on the bottom of the bowl was delicious and mixed well with the sauce and other tastes. My friends' pork tenderloin apparently was awesome so I guess I missed out here. One problem we had with the service was that our waiter specifically said our food would be out in 3 minutes. Well, we thought that was specific enough that it would probably be exact. But we waited over 10 minutes before it actually came out. That was kind of annoying.  The food, overall, was good. I was slightly disappointed but this is definitely a place you should probably give a try.",

I had no idea what was on the menu, I thought it was a standard steakhouse. Negative.   Sat at the bar, tried a scotch that the bartender recommended. Had never tried it before, was smoky and delicious. Started out with an appetizer of \"Tiger Shrimp and Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale\" in a corn-cilantro sauce. Out of this world delicious. The tamale was flavorful, the shrimp seemed fresh, and the sauce was awesome.  For a main course, I had the Fire Roasted Veal Chop. I haven't been a huge fan of veal until lately, and this was a well prepared dish. Top marks for the meal, the price wasn't so bad, and I'll 100% eat here again.  I came in to eat around 10:30PM and the place was still busy, so take that for what it's worth as well.",

    "text": "My roommate and I love the Food Network and had already decided to go to Mesa Grill before we even got to Vegas. We made a reservation the day before for 7:30 on a Tuesday night. We got there early and had to wait for a few minutes but we were early so no big deal. The decor of the restaurant is very colorful and the wood hanging from the ceiling was a cool touch.  Being from Chicago, I felt that the prices on the menu were reasonable. We heard that they have great margaritas but we decided to save cash for going out later and didn't order drinks. We started with the smoked chicken and black bean quesadilla. It was fabulous! It has a sweet guacamole on top with a drizzled smokey/spicy sauce. So good! The blue corn muffins in the bread basket were crumbly but very good as well.  Then it came to the main course. I order the duck with a spicy sauce, cilantro oil and a goat cheese and chorizo tamale. The duck was really good. The sauce that it came in was just okay. My tamale was pretty good as well but nothing compared to our appetizer! My roommate ordered the yucatan chicken tacos off the apps menu for her main course. She really enjoyed it. Overall very good!",

    "text": "This place is phenomenal. It was my favorite meal in my entire trip to Vegas. Its not cheap, but the food is well worth it. I ordered the pre-fixe menu with green pea and green chile soup, grilled scallops, and vanilla ice cream with protiferoles. My bf had the blue corn pancake and ancho chili-honey glazed salmon. AMAZING. Everything was great. The serrano ham gave it a little kick, but even without it, its still delicious. The scallops were grilled and served on top of tortilla chips and guac. Two scallops for the lunch portion. The blue corn pancake with duck was SO good, with a little asian influence. The salmon was awesome. Probably the best salmon we have ever had. Great balance of savory and sweet. I'm not a huge fan of protiferoles because they taste so stale to me. The dessert is nothing to write home about. But who cares!! Everything else makes up for it.  The atmosphere is fun and lively, but still able to maintain intimate atmosphere. The portions were perfect for lunch and we also ordered margaritas. I had a virgin white pear margarita and my bf ordered their organic margarita, which he said was good, but not great. Service was excellent, except for one detail. Maybe I'm spoiled, but in a restaurant like Mesa Grill, I expect the servers to always clean up your crumbs before each meal served. We made reservations for lunch, but from what I noticed, you don't need to. We did come on a weekday though.  I'd love to come here again for dinner next time!",

Very cheesy and fun, but honestly I could see being served this at a number of lesser known and cheaper (even chain) restaurants throughout the US.    But...the Cuban Burger.  Wow.  This was a 5 star burger.  Chef Flay will only allow the guys in here to prepare it Medium Rare (fine by me), so don't order it if your culinary pallet calls for all ground beef to be cooked to the color and texture of a hockey puck.  For those of us who like meat on the pink side- this is for us!  Love the mustard, pickles, etc on the burger.  Really one of the top 5 burgers I have ever had.    Too bad the margarita's were week (no buzz after drinking half of it on an empty stomach??) and the appetizer was just good (not great), or else this would be a 5 star review.",

I got the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin and it wasn't good to me. I asked how the chef recommended it be cooked (rare) and I thought that it was too raw/red for me. I would not recommend getting this dish although lots of people on Yelp say to do so. The Chile Relleno was really good and the margaritas we ordered were yummy as well. Ask which drinks are popular.  Service was excellent and the atmosphere is nice. I guess since I've been waiting to try this place for so long and after hearing about how yummy it is, I had some high expectations so when I finally got to try it out, no expectations were met and I was sad. Oh well--feels good to check this off my list though.",

One thing to note is that on the weekends, they only serve brunch and not a typical lunch menu. That being said, the brunch menu still has a good variety of breakfast and lunch options.  For brunch, I ordered the Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash. It was the perfect amount of spicy with the rich hollandaise sauce over the poached eggs and hash combo. It was a nice twist on the typical corned beef hash, with chicken as the meat and a switch to sweet potatoes. I would definitely recommend for a hearty breakfast that is much different from traditional options.   Another favorite was the plate of mini breads, muffins, and scones that came complimentary before the meal. There was a chocolate scone, something that resembled a jalapeno cornbread, cheesy roll, all were delicious!",

This was recommended by the couple sitting next to us, who had just shared the appetizer.  They were right,  so so SO glad I ordered that.  Entrees ordered at our table was the tenderloin and chicken.  Both were great!  The tenderloin is super spicy, but it hits your palate a little later.  All the food was incredible.  And oh my goodness, the bread!  I know, what's exciting about bread?!  Blue corn muffins...yes please!!!  The others were raisin bread and a jalapeno bread.  Awesome!!  My husband and I were still talking about it the next day!  Serving staff was friendly and attentive and never let our water glasses go empty.  The only complaint I had was that the person taking the plates away actually took them while we were still eating on them.  My example: we finished off the goat cheese appetizer and still had about 5 or 6 chips left on the plate.  The guy (not our waiter) came over and took our plate while I still had a chip in my hand, clearly it was still eating.  Now, granted I wasn't assertive and didn't say anything.    Overall good experience!  I would visit again if I come back to Vegas!!  (Love Bobby Flay's recipes on Food Network!)",

    "text": "I've eaten a Mesa Grill during every trip I've taken to vegas in the last 4-5 years and it's always been top notch from making a reservation to the great steaks, but my most recent visit on January 21st was disappointing.   We needed to change our reservation at the last minute and since we were staying at Caesars we first went through the concierge, but when we needed to speak with someone about a time change we were transferred directly to a hostess.  I've worked in restaurants for years and I know it can be stressful and people ask you to move mountains sometimes but I was just trying to add 2 people to our party and try and keep the reservation time as close to what it had been as possible. When I was told we'd need to come an extra hour later I needed to check with everyone first so I said I'd call back in a couple minutes. I called back using the same number 2 minutes later and the concierge said I didn't need to be transferred back and that they would move the reservation.   Speed forward to 8:45 and the hostess finds our reservation moved but only for 4 people not 6. She IMMEDIATELY cops an attitude and tells me that she remembers my call and she knows that I needed a table for 6 not the reserved 4 and I can't just show up expecting them to add people AND she specifically told me I'd have to change the reservation to a later time...which I had done. I felt it necessary to point out to her that why would I have moved the res. an hour later if I was keeping the original party size. I was then told that the concierge isn't able to change reservations and I should called her back... I had tried to do just that and was told by the concierge they were capable.   Long story slightly shorter this hostess was a total bitch and could use a lesson in customer service.  The customer isn't always right, but drop the attitude until you know you're right, ok?   This whole experience really put me off of Mesa Grill especially after I ate later that week next door at Old Homestead and it was AMAZING. I'll spend my money where I'm getting the total package and not somewhere I'm getting the stink eye from some stuck up 20something",

Its easy to forget you're in the middle of a casino. However, the meal itself just didn't measure up to my expectations. Yeah it's in Vegas & owned by a celebrity chef so we expected to spend a few hundred dollars but we also expected it the be a great meal. It wasn't. I'd say somewhere between okay and pretty good but by no means great. Of the dishes that I remember...  APPETIZERS Bread Basket - not an app but still worth mentioning. it's full of different kinds of bread and the jalapeno cheese corn bread it good. grab it before someone else at your table does.  Blue Corn Pancake with BBQ Duck - pretty good. the BBQ sauce carried most of the flavor and you couldn't taste the duck. still pretty good though. Tiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale - good flavor combinations. proly my favorite item overall. kinda small though. Looking at the name I was thinking they were serving Tiger Prawn but these are just regular-ass scrimps.  Tuna Nachos - Meh. pretty creative but didn't come with a lot of flavor  ENTREES Filet - filet was good but I wouldn't put it in my top 5 & considering it was $50, I feel like it really should have been better. The temperature was right on the money but it was just missing something.  Grilled Chicken - i thought grilled chicken would be way to boring for a Bobby Flay restaurant but it's on the menu. It's exactly what you think it is...grilled chicken. It was juicy but again nothing to get excited about.  Pan Seared Sea Scallops - These were actually pretty good.  I also ordered 2 margaritas and they were on par with everything else...so so. I really wanted to luv this place but the items we tried just didn't live up to the hype. Would I eat there again? Maybe for lunch. Dinner wasn't worth $325 for 4 ppl in my opinion.",

My husband and I started with the blue corn lobster tacos.  Who knew you could shove so much flavor into three little tacos?! There were decent chunks of lobster and the balance of spicy, sweet and tart was spot on.  It was $20 for three tiny little tacos, but I can say with some certainty that I would definitely order them again.   Okay, on to the entrees--I ordered the grilled lamb porterhouse chops and they were phenomenal.  They were tender, perfectly cooked to the recommended medium. A preserved serrano chile sauce and mint chimichurri accompanied the lamb and it was a combination of sauces that you pretty much want to put on everything. The blue corm tamale with basil butter was also pretty tasty, but I liked the goat cheese tamale that came with my husband's veal a little better.  Overall, I thought my dish was slightly better than his, but he devoured his plate easily and with no hesitations, so I doubt he felt the same.    Oh did I forget to mention the bread basket?  Also delicious of course.  The jalepeno corn bread was my favorite, but you really can't go wrong with any of them. The crusty french bread and blue corn muffin was also just ridiculous.  We were so full after all this food that we skipped dessert.  This was probably a huge mistake as I imagine the desserts were probably equally as mind blowing.  I suppose this just gives us an excuse to go back the next time we're in town.  Don't miss this place.",

We had the spinach and cauliflower for sides, both went well with the steak. We didn't go for desert because the portions were very good sized. The decor of the restaurant was very inviting and nice. There is no background music which made it easier for our table to have conversations through out the meal. The service was on point as everything has been in Caesars Palace so far.

Lobster tacos for app, good but barely a mouthful, literally each taco was the size of my thumb. and 3 of them for $21 is gougingly pricey. My steak was good,my wife loved her Mahi Mahi. Pesto mashed potatoes were great and the sauteed spinach was OK. We ordered a chocolate pudding sticky toffee for dessert and the ice cream that came with it tasted so bad we couldn't finish our dessert. Lastly the coffee they brought with dessert was burnt and unpalatable.

The menu isn't extensive but has pretty much something for everyone as far as proteins go.  If you hate spicy food, you may not love it here as they don't hold back on spice and flavor.  I was torn between many of the appetizer and entree choices so took recommendations from my bartender who also made me a killer margarita. The complimentary bread basket is tough to not fill up on....so good.  My ahi tuna nachos were very fresh and a unique spin on \"nachos\"....not so much nachos and more of a \"create your own bruschetta on corn chips\" type situation.  The signature pork dish was absolutely delicious.  Very spicy rub, cooked perfectly, with a sauce on the side that I could have even with a spoon for weeks.  Pushing 5 stars for me if I didn't feel the price per item was a major stretch...but I guess, when in Vegas...",

    "text": "Now that I've been here a couple times I feel I can dole out a fairly balanced review. I'm not a huge fan of Cesar's Palace but a few years ago while I was in Vegas I found out my aunt and uncle were in town. Needing a break from partying with my friends I decided to rendezvous with family for a quiet dinner. My aunt asked me to meet them at Mesa. I was immediately impressed with the space and the decor.   Since I wasn't too hungry I ordered a soup. I believe it was the pumpkin soup and it was delicious because I recall telling them I wish I had more room in my tummy for a second serving of the soup. My uncle ordered some fish dish and my aunt ordered the cornmeal encrusted Chile relleno. The chile relleno looked so good I knew I would have to return one day to try it for myself.  Fast forward a few years and I'm back with my husband. We ordered some cocktails and shared a delicious salad. I ordered the fire roasted chile relleno stuffed with manchego cheese and he ordered the rib-eye. When his steak arrived I thought they had accidentally brought him a porterhouse. It was huge. Although he had ordered his steak medium, it arrived medium rare and was so fatty he wasn't enjoying it. I felt bad, I knew he wouldn't send it back because he loves Bobby Flay and was raving about the Bobby Flay steakhouse in Atlantic City for years until he finally got a chance to take me. I guess I wasn't the only person who noticed his situation because our waitress came over and said she sensed he didn't like his meal. She offered to take it back to the kitchen and bring him the filet. I couldn't believe it. She was so astute! Now, that's service! He gobbled up the coffee crusted filet and loved it. We both left very satisfied with our meals.",

We started with a white peach margarita for me, and my husband had the Prickly pear margarita.  Both were very good, but I preferred the lighter taste of the white peach.  We were fortunate to dine here when there was a Summer Prix Fixe menu available which was a very good value.  $50 for an appetizer, main course and desert.  I had the signature appetizer of garlic shrimp and corn tamale.  It was very, very good.  The masa was light, and the shrimp were perfectly prepared-not over cooked.  It was very tasteful without being too big or too heavy. For the main course, I had the ancho chile glazed salmon.  Again, it was cooked perfectly (medium as I ordered it).  It was so tasty without being too heavy in the glaze.  For dessert I had the coconut cake.  It was very light with toasted coconut on the top.   The service was attentive without being over-bearing.",

    "text": "I feel like I have finally brokered a lasting peace with the brussel sprout. They were the bane of my existence as a child. One of my English father's favorite side dishes and they were usually cooked beyond recognition in our home. As part of my master plan to enjoy and appreciate all foods, especially those I've avoided since childhood, I've started ordering it every time I see it on the menu.  This has worked very well at the Farm Cafe in Portland, but not so much at Aureole in NYC. There they served it as a puree and boy that was some rough going. But Bobby Flay and his team managed to move me from toleration to adoration of this long avoided vegetable. Maybe it was the addition of toasted pecans and pomegranate seeds?   Vegas is a weird mix of upscale and low rent, but this restaurant managed to walk the line as a casually nice place. Expensive, but not ridiculous in the context of the Vegas price scale, and I felt the food and service made it feel like money well spent. Aside from one flickering light above our table (that they were very apologetic about) our service was wonderfully attentive.  We started with cocktails and I enjoyed the house Mesa Margarita and Mr. K upgraded, per usual, to one of the higher end variations. Both were nice, especially when coupled with our Crispy Squid appetizer and the wonderful selections from the bread tray. Three diverse choices, but I especially enjoyed the walnut bread.  For our entrees, I chose the Grilled Mahi Mahi and Mr. K had the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin. Mine was filled with subtle flavor and texture, but the pork had a nice kick. Enough that you probably want to think twice about ordering it if you like things mild. The sides are served family style and in addition to the brussel sprouts, the chili relleno was very good, but the mashed potatoes weren't memorable.  Of all the places we dined, this was a place where we were contemplating returning for dinner the very next day.  And our dining companions managed to do just that. I'm jealous.",

We got a brunch menu at 12pm on a Friday. Was expecting lunch so I had to readjust my decisions. They brought a bread basket to the table but it was all muffins and weirdly butter-heavy brunch items that I did not care for. Ordered a burger medium rare. It was medium, a sloppy mess to eat, and had no flavor. The avocado it came with had too much pepper on it and, while the fries were crispy how I like them, they were overly salty. On our way out we walked past the guy grilling burgers. He had 15 hockey pucks in a tray below the grill. And by hockey pucks I mean overcooked burgers that are NOT MADE TO ORDER. You are a disgrace to the food world Bobby Flay, I lost ALL respect for you- how can you put your name on this disaster of a dining establishment??",

From the moment we walked into the restaurant the reception desk was genuinely nice and made us feel VERY welcomed. Genoa was our server and she was top notch knowing the cocktail and food menu inside out and she and the rest of the staff did a perfect job.  I was concerned about the food being too spicy for my husband because he is not a fan of \"southwestern\" food (but I guess we really never had True southwestern food before)  Nothing was to spicy everything was delicious, perfect...done right! I had the New York strip steak and brussel sprouts. The steak was one of the best I've ever had, cooked perfectly, so flavorful with Flay's homemade steak sauce. Brussel sprouts were perfectly cooked and delicious. I think they were cooked with bacon and vinaigrette but again nothing overpowering...it just enhanced the  sprouts!  We split a baked potato that had creme fraiche and horseradish IT WAS DELICIOUS! (I don't even know what creme fraiche is but I want more!!).  My husband had the salmon and spinach and he LOVED IT (very rare for him to rave about his food!) We also had a margarita from the very extensive margarita menu and they were excellent too. Bread was fresh and delicious. Some bread had jalapenos but again it wasn't overly done and my husband gobbled it up (what? who is this guy, he doesn't eat jalapenos lol!) The table next to us ordered the double pork chop...OMG it looked unbelievable and the man eating it was a very happy diner! His wife had the 16 spice chicken and she loved hers too! Though our meal was quite expensive we left there very very happy and certainly didn't mind spending the buck$ on a genuine gourmet meal with an outstanding staff.  Thanks Bobby Flay! you really are at the top of your game, better than any other! We look forward to returning.",

    "text": "This review is for their Spring Las Vegas Restaurant Week 2014 Menu.   There's a lot of hype surrounding Mesa Grill, and it lives up to it. Mesa Grill has a reputation for its food having rich, Southwestern flavors, and its impeccable service.   Appetizers - Sophie's Chopped Salad: Not the best introduction to my dining experience, only because the salad had chickpeas and olives -- not a fan of these -- that weren't mentioned on the menu. A coworker had me try her Blue Corned Pancake with Barbecued Duck, now that was good! If I hadn't known it was duck, I would've thought the meat was pork.   Main Course - Smoked Shrimp Tacos: Our waiter praised these tacos and strongly encouraged me to order them, which I'm glad I did. Along with the tacos there were three condiments: guacamole, tomatillo salsa, and a mango habanero salsa that wasn't burn-your-tongue-off spicy. The shrimps tasted fresh and were well-seasoned that the sauces were unnecessary and just made eating a little messier --- the mango habanero salsa will make your white napkin turn orange before you're done with your meal.  Dessert - Chef's Choice Chocolate Pudding: A chocolate pudding topped with chocolate mousse, topped with chocolate toffee -- yep, that's a lot of chocolate! The pudding reminded me of the Jello pudding cups that you can buy at the grocery store. Adding more chocolate toffee pieces or even some fresh berries would've saved the dessert from being just average.   Service - Exceptional and attentive.  Overall - Even though there were some slight disappointments with the food, they're not enough to discourage me from returning.",

    "text": "Overall entrees were good. Expected more of an experience as a whole from this restaurant though. Entrees 4 stars, experience 3 stars.   Complimentary bread (1 star): Very DRY. The only one in there that was okay was the corn muffin, and that still wasn't even that fresh. Other than that the jalopeno cheese and walnut bread were super dry. Scared me at first cause I thought I chose a bad restaurant just from how the bread was. Good thing the rest of the meal turned out better.   Grilled Chicken (5 stars): Very moist and flavorful. Mashed potatoes were great too.   Lobster Out of the Shell (4 stars): Lobster itself was bomb. The hominy cakes underneath it, meh could have done without them on my plate all together. Very dense and not very flavorful. Lobster and sauce on the other hand was so good, but really, those cakes were just horrible! Try changing them to mashed potatoes or something.  Came for my birthday but they don't do anything special for you!! )= They will only put a candle in whatever dessert you order. But come on with the money you spend here you can't bring out something small that's complimentary? It just makes it feel more like a celebration when they do that. The desserts didn't sound that great either. Probably wouldn't choose this for a special occasion dinner because of that.  SERVICE (3.5 stars): Our waiter was nice, hard to find at times, and just really busy with all the other tables he was helping. Took long to get things we requested, or he'd forget and we had to remind him.   I don't know if I'll be back here. The entrees were pretty good, well half of the lobster dish was good. Maybe I'll try appetizers more. But the overall experience was just bleh. And that bread...aye...make fresher bread! Or better bread if it was \"fresh\", bad first impression right when you sit down.",

They had my new quesadilla out in no time and removed it from my bill. I wish I could say that it was delicious.. but I can't. It was not even so so. It tasted like something that was previously frozen and re-heated. It breaks my heart to write this review.  The one positive... the bar staff was a 10!!",

Both times I've eaten here I have opted for the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Tenderloin. I believe they boast this as one of their signature dishes and it's for good reason. The tenderloin has great chile spice flavor and is the most tender pork dish I've ever had. The sweet potato tamale on the side is the perfect pairing with the chile tenderloin.   The bread basket served before the meal has a variety of breads and all are tasty. My favorite is the blue corn cornbread. The appetizer that sent my taste buds in a spiral was the Tiger Shrimp & Roasted Corn Tamale. The flavors in this appetizer are out of this world and the sauce is good enough to eat alone.",

Better be good for me to give this a decent review.  DEAR GOD DOUBLE HUGE ..... They chops were big enough for four people so at first I was in shock. Nothing this size called lamb could be tender right? Holy lamb these were melt in your mouth tender. The combination of mint an Chimichurri and pumpkin blew my taste buds away. I NEVER take prepared food back, but there was so much left - yep I ate them again at 2am. Don't judge lol  The wait staff was so sweet when my husband had to abruptly leave.

We never needed to ask for a refill of water, the waiter was constantly there refilling our water before it even got low...ordered the Tiger Shrimp and roasted garlic corn Tamale appetizer and it was mouth watering!!! The masa was so moist and flavorful, not to mention the sauce on the tamale was \"the cherry\" on top. Just when I thought it couldn't get any better my salmon came and it was cooked perfectly and it was seared to make a crust that had a nice crunch...Ancho Chile-honey glaze on top was absolutely delicious!!! Ended dinner with the Chocolate and Berry Shortcake...couldn't get any better than that!  On top of the food being spectacular, the service matched it...John was our waiter and he didn't let us down, checked on us often and offered after-dinner coffee...All the other servers were friendly as well. We received and greeting from everyone and also a thank you when we left. AH-mazing",

We ordered the pork tenderloin sandwich with the fries and the tiger shrimp tamale. Both of them are amazing! Bobby takes the tamales to another level. It's so tasty! The meat on the sandwich are just superb! My boyfriend does not usually eat sandwich, but he loves it!! The size is pretty huge.

We showed up with eventually 9 people and was seated pretty promptly so good job to host. But we only ordered the salmon to share and the chicken quesadilla. And the salmon didn't come with ANYTHING. We had to separately order a side of asparagus. Salmon was small and the quesadilla was...ok. Not too many ways you can jazz that up. Without....without drinks and the bill came to over $70 without tip! WTF?? What kind of whore is Flay? Trying to afford all his ex wives and girlfriends? Holy crap! The rest of our party was \"ok\" wit their food and they didn't drink either but ended up paying over $250! Way over priced and not very good food. We were expecting so much more and we're just disappointed at every turn. I'll never come back nor patronize any other Flay location. Robert Irvine at Tropicana is 100 times better...not cheaper but at least you get what you pay for.",

    "text": "This place is amazing. Bobby Flay has outdone himself. The decor and ambiance is great. Very welcoming when you first walk in. Came here with my girlfriend for some lunch.   We ordered the tamale as an appetizer. The dish was amazing. Large pieces of shrimp. Creamy sauce. Just the right amount of heat (wouldn't be a bobby Flay dish if it didn't have heat). Everything just meshed so well together. We also tried some bread from the table bread basket. Even the bread was delicious.   She had the Cobb salad and I had the hash. Both dishes were amazing. The egg on the hash was perfectly cooked. Nice and runny. Good amount of heat. But the flavor was just incredible. My mouth is watering as I type this review and reminisce about this dish. Yup, it was THAT good.  The Cobb salad wasn't anything to dismiss. It was amazing. Yes, for a salad. Large strips of bacon, crumbled cheese. I'm not a salad type of guy but I would eat this again for sure.  I will be back here next time I'm in Vegas, you can count on it.",

Everything food-wise was very good, except for the mahi-mahi which was truly amazing -- the best I've ever had. Overall, I ordered the Ahi Tuna nachos a glass of mescal, and the mahi-mahi. It also came with a really nice Bread Basket.  The decor is bright and open, and there's a lot of natural energy. There is a dress code -- no hats :) but aside from that it's pretty casual.  Overall highly recommended, I'd say a must visit if you're in the area.",

    "text": "So I've been to Vegas three or four times in my life and each time, I've eaten at Mesa Grill. I tried the Spicy Chicken + Sweet Potato Hash on my first visit and I was instantly hooked.  It goes without saying, then, that when I found out I'd be coming to Vegas for my birthday, I immediately booked a brunch reservation at Mesa Grill.  We arrived right on time and were seated at a small table between two loud tables. Really? I booked this reservation months in advance and this is where you choose to seat me?  But okay, fine. I'm willing to overlook a questionable choice like that if the experience is otherwise perfect. It was not perfect. Not even close.  My dining companion and I decided to start with a cocktail each, and my dining companion also took the opportunity to ask the waitress what she recommended on the food side of things. Said waitress immediately pointed out the most expensive items on the menu. Annoying, but forgivable.  By the time the waitress returned with our cocktails, we were ready to order. My dining companion decided to go with the Smoked Salmon Quesadilla, which provoked a bit of a face from our waitress and a declaration that it wasn't big enough to work as a main meal (even though it costs as much as most of the mains). Extremely annoying and not terribly forgivable, to be honest.  But fine, we plowed ahead. My dining companion decided to go with the Blue Corn Buttermilk Waffles, to which we were told that the kitchen had \"run out\" of this item. So that's two things my dining companion attempted to order and twice she was shot down. Not surprisingly, she said she needed a minute to pick something else.  Finally, my turn had come. The reason I had booked this reservation so far in advance. I proudly told the waitress that I wanted the Spicy Chicken + Sweet Potato Hash. A distressingly sour face ensued and I was told the kitchen was unable to make that, either.  Really. You're a professional kitchen run by a celebrity chef and you don't have TWO items available on a fairly limited menu? Even if I were willing to accept that, I absolutely cannot accept that we weren't told about these unavailable items the second we sat down or, at the very least, before we ordered our cocktails!  Fuming, I choked down my cocktail and asked for the bill, assuming the drinks would be comped. No such luck. Instead, our waitress amazingly, brazenly asked if I wanted another drink to go! She just might be the most boldly money-hungry individual I've *ever* met, and I know quite a few lawyers.  What a horrible, awful experience and on my birthday no less. Bobby Flay, you are dead to me.",

MESA grill by Bobby Flay definitely stands out not only as one of the tastiest steak houses, but also for the reasonable prices compared to other steakhouses.  The service is exquisite, friendly staff, and willing to assist with any food allergies or other preferences.   Definitely try the NY strip steak, quesadillas, side dishes were good too. Just overall a great spot! 4.5 stars! Been there for 5 times already, and definitely not the last.   Trust me, I know food.",

The restaurant is very spacious and pretty big, situated in Caesars palace next to the sports book.   Was served complementary bread which were unique.  Jalapeno, cornbread, and walnuts and cranberry.  They were all very good!   Order a rough cut tuna nachos which comes with avocado crema and mango habanero hot sauce.  The tuna was very flavourful, nicely seasoned, the chips were home made and very crispy and both sauces paired very well with the tuna.    Also ordered a Cornmeal crusted Chile relleno with sweet pepper sauce.  It had eggplant inside, with a nice spice and vinegrette that added just the right tang! The spice wasn't too overwhelming but just enough to add a small kick!   The service was great too, had my water topped up many times!!   Would love to come back during dinner after our meal today!!",

When our main courses arrived one of our guests was not served. Being polite we waited 10 minutes for our remaining guest to receive her dinner. Of course all of our dinners got cold while waiting.  Our waiter saw us waiting and did not seem to care.  I ordered a steak. I was told this restaurant was known for great steaks. What I received was a piece of meat so tough and tasteless it was beyond poor. It was so hard to chew I only ate part of it. At no time did the waiter inquire if our food was satisfactory because, had he done so, I would have made my dissatisfaction clear.  As I said this was my first visit and I don't plan to return. Maybe it was just an anomaly for us, but all seven guests at our table unanimously expressed dissatisfaction.",

The most memorable dish was the lobster taco appetizer, just small enough for me to eat it in one big bite.  The explosion of flavor was great, everything in balance.  The other apps were the tiger shrimp, which was nice but a bit sweet.  Tuna nachos with sweet hot sauce again.  You get the feeling here that it's all about the hot and sweet on every single dish.  Entree was the spice rubbed pork tenderloin with yeah, sweet, sweet, sweet everything.  Bourbon in the sauce, sweet potato, pecan butter (sweet) and ancho chilis.    The meal just got monotonous.  Nothing wrong with it but only the lobster tacos were impressive.  Oh and the margaritas were more sweet than sour too.",

That's what I order now everytime we eat here. We also tried the filet mignon which I was a bit skeptical at first because of the \"coffee crusted\" part but for some reason it works. Haha! The mashed potatoes with the creamy sauce in the middle is delicious and so is the tamale that goes as a side. The mango crusted tuna was good too if you're not a red-meat lover. The only thing I wasn't a big fan of was the pork. The presentation of each dish was beautiful and all the waters each time we have gone have been kind and knowledgable.  A bit pricey but worth it!",

Very nice. They also have a selection of specialized margaritas to supplement the flavors on the menu.  The food itself was exquisite, perfectly prepared, and delicious. The Queso Fundido (goat cheese dip) was creamy and robust. The mahi tacos were unbelievable - the fish was perfectly cooked, the slaw provided a great crunch, and the trio of toppings (black beans, avocado dressing, and a honey mustard) were the best balance of flavor.  The staff was unbelievably friendly, warm, and attentive. The atmosphere was exactly what I wanted and the food was perfect. Highly recommend this place.",

We had brunch here (no lunch on weekends..just brunch) to avoid paying $$$$ for dinner. Cheap I know. Given that Mr. Flay is an iron chef I just HAD to try out his cooking. The restaurant is tex-mex so keep that in mind. I read that the shrimp tamales are the best thing to get here...but sadly I did not get it.  The bread basket was a nice perk as its not filled with your usual baguette or French loaf. It had blueberry bars, cookies, and mini biscuits. The dishes were carefully thought out and plated beautifully.  I personally felt that the home fries (which are not french fries, btw) were a little tooooo salty.  I admit that this place is pricey. You'll pretty much be spending $20 or more per person. But you are in Vegas! Splurge a little!",

The wait wasn't terrible, the ambiance was warm, earthy and classy, very warm and comfortable. Went here for a special occasion, was seated with a reservation around 7 I believe within a reasonable few minutes. The cheddar or asiago cranberry bread in the assorted basket was yummy. The cactus something sweet unsweetened tea was amazing! The portions were more than generous. Try the sweet potato tamale and the chipotle pork tenderloin or the bascobel blackberry sauce grilled lamb. It made it exciting to try the burger bar a few months later when we visited NYC.",

    "text": "\"This is the best thing I have ever put in my mouth\" A common sentence used when Nickole and I dined here last Monday. Christine the bartender is AWESOME and made the best recommendations for us. Started our meal off with a house Margarita on the rocks with salt. Made up of Hurradurra Tequila, fresh squeezed lime, and agave syrup it was so good. Nickole had a White Peach Margarita and that was amazing as well.  For an appetizer we had the Tiger Shrimp Tamale, wow. Honestly the best thing I have ever eaten. With garlic corn, and a cilantro sauce that makes you want to cry... this Tamale was sculpted by gods, i swear. I could eat this dish every day. Drink #2 Pear Margarita. YUM Not too sweet but with a slight hint of pear. Very good... and strong! For the entrees we both split the Smoked Shrimp Tacos and Ancho Chili Honey Glazed Salmon. wow x2. The Tacos were perfection. With grilled corn tortillas and a cabbage slaw the shrimp being so juicy and perfectly marinated this dish was to die for. The Salmon was perfect too. Cooked at a medium temp and on a bed of a house made black bean sauce and a cilantro oil the honey glaze complemented the salmon perfectly. Both amazing choices.  Drink #3 Pomegranate Martini a little on the strong side but pretty good Desert- Sticky Toffee cake. Being gluten free I only had a small bite to try it and If my allergy was mild and wouldn't cause me severe pain i would have eaten the whole thing. wow was it good! and with a side of house made ice cream it was truly the cherry on top to our meal.  I highly recommend this place to everyone. It will not disappoint! I cant wait to come back",

For starters I had the blue corn pancake with barbecue duck and the tiger shrimp with a garlic corn tamale. The tiger shrimp and the tamale was very awesome, perfect combination of flavors. I found the pancake and duck however to be a little too sweet, if they could fix the sauce it would be awesome. For our main course my friend and i shared the spicy chicken and sweet potato hash, which was splendid. For being on the Strip I didn't think the prices were too bad either.  Biggest downside: It is in Caesar's, which is not my favorite place to be on the Strip.",

In both sittings, the food was outstanding.  Another review talks about the shrimp corn tamale, no kidding, it's great.   Night one, we ate from the appetizers guided by the bartender Donna.   Holy cow, what a great guide.   Seriously, saddle up to the bar, and let Donna steer your dinner.   What a wonderful guide and ambassador for the restaurant.  She explains the dish, subtlety, the .... she was nothing short of great.     Night two was my wife's birthday and our server had some bigger parties than us that he paid attention to.   It was a bit of a turn off as he knew it was her birthday- no happy wife, no happy life.  Despite being a table of two compared to his other tables, the food still outstanding and I was awfully happy to have the tuna / mango.   Good grief, that was wonderful.... the mango sauce is something I need to master.  Too bad we didn't sit at the bar.  For me, this is a no brainer repeat and easy reccomendation",

First, I was a little surprised that it was \"build your own taco\", but whatever. The shrimp were cooked fine, but they were over seasoned and so instead of flavor I just tasted sodium. The cabbage slaw topping was really tasty and the condiments were fresh and tasty. The bread basket was very good, especially the jalapeno bread.  The price was a little steep for essentially 6 shrimp, some cabbage and bread (I just had water for drink) ...30 after tip.",

I am partial to the cornbread.  It has little pieces of jalapeno baked in.  For my entree I chose the Cascabel Chile Crusted Rabbitt.  It was great.  It comes as a tenderloin and a leg.  The meat was tender, and the sauce added great flavor.  Even the toasted cous cous was tasty.  This place is always busy.

So we had 5pm dinner reservations for 6ppl. 3 of us arrived a few minutes early and checked in, the host advised us we wouldnt be seated until all of our party arrived and that our table wasnt ready. Thr waiting area was packed and we sat at the bar. There were a ton of empty tables, but whatev. We ordered 2 Partida margaritas and I asked for a frozen one but it was either straight or on the rocks... Ok, when anyone thinks of a margarita they think of a yummy frozen drink. This was the second fail.    The rest of our party arrived and we let the waitress know... But we still ended up waiting another 20mins. Finally we get seated and our waitress gives us our menus and 2 mins later asks if we are ready to order, ahhh! No way man!  I look at the menu and first im in price shock, but then I was like \"is this all?\" The selections werent impressive at all. I usually only eat chicken and here they had only one dish!!! They had a ton of meat and a lot of fish. The entree prices are 25$ and up. We ordered a few apps: the shrimp tamale, the chicken tacos, the chorizo meatballs, and some salads.  Ok so heres the rundown!  The apps: ok so for 12$-18$ for apps I expect not just 1 tamale or 3 small balls... But this is what you get. The chorizo had a smooth texture, which I am not used to, and were sooo small! Basically each of the 6 of us got half a ball. We also had to share 1 measly tamale and 3 chicken skewers and soft tortillas... Ahh!   Dinner: I ordered 16 spice chicken. I noticed that the sides were 8$ each... What!? Whatever we ended.up ordering 2 mashed potatos which to me were creamy and bland &Some brussel sprouts. My chicken came and it was a piece of dark and light rubbed in what seemed like adobo spices. I tried it and it def needed salt imo and towards the middle it looked a little pink so I stopped eating it. Sad face for sure. I ended up just eating some jalapeno bread and the dark piece.  My gringo friends love it here; I am not a fan. Its a small amount of food for the price which was whatever. I didnt like that we had to wait for a reservation and my friend had to ask twice for items he ordered. The waitress was ok, a lil weird : ) we dropped 600$ with tip and they were acting like we were bothering them by asking them for things. Oh well! I did love their paper towels in the bathroom!",

The dinner wait can go up towards an hour, so plan accordingly. The second time we went, we strategically chose to come during lunch time and there was no wait at all. SUCCESS!!!  PROS: - Shrimp and corn tamale - best freaking tamale ever. You HAVE to order this. - Complimentary bread basket -  southwest corn muffin, jalapeno and cheese bread, and cranberry and walnut bread. Everything was delicious. - Ambiance and decor - that wood panel ceiling is incredible. - Service: attentive, kept our water and bread basket refilled.   CONS: - They make you take your hat off! It felt a little intrusive, but I guess Mesa Grill is a nice enough place, where they can request such things.  - Depending on what you order, the food can be SO HEAVY, my cousin and I were in a food coma for HOURS, and we only shared an appetizer and entree.  - Spicy chicken and sweet potato hash - more an appetizer to be shared than an entree on its own. I got tired of it towards the very end of sharing, so I couldn't imagine having it all for myself.",

I'm holding back one star overall just because of value, although admittedly it's hard to find good value in Vegas where everything seems overpriced. The food here is great and the service is excellent.  The tuna and veal chop are both delicious. The lobster tacos were a little underwhelming as an app, especially for $20. The mashed potatoes with cilantro and pesto were great, as were the plantains in molasses butter.  Great joint, I just felt the $200 spend for two people with one app, two entrees, a couple sides and a few drinks was a bit much.",

But seriously, it met every one of my expectations and more.  My best friend and I ordered the shrimp tamale, the blue corn crusted halibut, and a peach margarita to share.  First, the peach margarita. Super strong. With just half the drink (admittedly on an empty stomach), I was buzzin pretty hard.  The tamales. Oh god the tamales. We had been dreaming about this dish for so long, and it surpassed all of my expectations. The sauce was so amazing delicious. Rich, but not overtly so, and perfectly seasoned. The shrimp was succulent and the tamale itself was delicious, not too dry and a bit sweet, with little pieces of corn studded through out. The sauce was what really pulled this appetizer together though.  The blue corn crusted halibut paled in comparison to the tamale, but it was delicious in its own right. While not the best thing I've ever had, the blue corn crust was unique. The halibut itself was flaky and wonderfully moist. The tomato based sauce was really yummy, and went surprisingly well with the fish.  Lastly, the bread basket. Mesa Grill has the best bread basket I've ever had. The jalapeno and cheddar bread was my favorite, with the sweet dessert bar coming in at a close second.  Service was good, if a bit pushy with the drinks, the atmosphere is wonderful, and the next time I go to Mesa Grill, I'm getting 2 shrimp tamales as my entree. :)",

    "text": "So, here the Wolfpack and I are, staying at Caesar's Palace and hungry as all get out after a gloriously long day of gambling and debauchery looking for a place to get a good steak. And because we're in Vegas, we know we have an impressive selection to choose from. But regardless of all of the other 5 star grills and restaurants boasting the greatest menus in town, we find our hearts set on Bobby Flay's place and have to pay it a visit.  I wasn't sure what to expect out of Mesa Grill, but I was totally in love with everything about this place. The style - a relaxed yet elegant and modern space with warm lighting and beautiful decor - exactly what I'd imagine coming from a restaurant that Bobby Flay has anything to do with.  We were seated right away in a cozy booth toward the back of the restaurant, giving us ample opportunity to people watch and enjoy each others company on our first big vacation with just the three of us.  Our service was great, albeit a bit slow. But, to be fair, it was a bit of a busy night and we were seated in a section with a couple of larger groups, so I can excuse the wait times for refills and for our checks. But hopefully, next time everything will be a little bit more prompt - I'd love to give that last star - I know this place deserves it.  Now for the main event - the food.  Let me start off by saying that if I had been in pretty much any other restaurant and seen a steak that was over a pound, I would have rolled my eyes and moved right on down the menu in search of something a less ridiculous. But, because I all three of us were going all out, I just went with it. The description of the Chipoltle Glazed Rib Eye was too enticing - despite the fact that this monster was 22 ounces of beefy goodness. I don't have words for how amazing this cut of cow was. Cooked to a PERFECT medium rare (what else would you expect from a place like this?), I probably ate an impressive three quarters of it. I just couldn't stop. Do yourself a favor and fast for a majority of the day to eat this whole thing, because trust me - it's worth every last, heavenly bite. The side of cilantro pesto mashed potatoes that I ordered, however, was not forgotten. I nearly finished all of those, too.  Of course, by the end of our entrees we had absolutely NO room for desserts. We'll just have to wait for next to delve into that mess - I mean, banana cream pie? Churros? Man. Looking back in retrospect - maybe we should have done it anyway.",

Coming from Southern California, where we have an abundance of  excellent, inexpensive Mexican food, it's not easy to justify spending a lot of $$ for \"upscale\" Mexican, but I'm really glad that we decided to give it a try.  The decor and vibe is classy but still casual. Service was friendly and professional. Food was absolutely delicious! We had the goat cheese and blue corn chip appetizer. An amazing blend of flavors! I had the pork entree and my husband had the 16 spice chicken. Both were fantastic. We only wished we weren't so full, because everything tasted so good, we wanted to keep eating! The spices were blended perfectly and the heat was just enough to tingle, but not overwhelm our tastebuds.   Definitely give Mesa Grill a try if you're visiting Vegas. It is worth it.",

    "text": "\"Not Mexican and not Chinese.\" Those were the parameters set by Beau S. when he asked me to pick a restaurant for a \"late lunch/early dinner\" yesterday  (4/13/11) before I had to head to work.  Somehow, we ended up at Mesa, which, according to Beau, isn't Mexican, it's Tex-Mex, which is just \"spicy American food.\"   Upon walking in, it sorta looks like Guy Fieri had free reign to liberally apply as many \"flame\" touches as possible - from the sconces to the ceiling, there were flames...and cowhide backed chairs, and toile backed chairs, and rainbow tea jars, and various other curious design choices throughout the restaurant.   When seated, the waiter asked if I would like anything to drink. I said \"water, no lemon please\" and he walked off. Apparently it didn't matter if Beau wanted anything to drink, because he, by default, would get what I was getting, regardless of what he wanted. Never mind that he was the one paying.  We were given at least 5 menus between the two of us. I couldn't decide if I should have the spicy beef tenderloin tartare appetizer or the barbecued lamb cobb salad. I decided to have my second cobb salad of the day so I went with that. Beau went with the spicy chicken and sweet potato hash.   Being a native Texan, and therefor quite familiar with Tex- Mex cuisine, I found it curious that a restaurant that billed itself as \"Tex-Mex\" had two semi-Tex-Mex offerings on the lunch menu: Tacos and a chile relleno. All other offerings may have the inclusion of \"New Mexican spice blend\" (whatever that is) or a green chile sauce atop American fare but that's kinda... not really Tex-Mex.   Our waiter delivered us a bread basket containing the following: -2 slices of jalapeno French bread. -1 blue and yellow corn muffin. (The blue corn part had the consistency of Moon Sand and fell apart when I picked it up.) -2 slices of (Pepperidge Farm) raisin bread. (Yeah, I have no idea what that's about.)   When the waiter brought out the food, he accidentally stepped on my foot and about had a heart attack, thinking I was one of those money hungry crazies that threaten to sue if so much as an eyelash is found on their napkin. It really wasn't that big of a deal and didn't even hurt. No biggie, but I guess he had no way of knowing I wasn't going to demand his termination to the manager for the gaffe.   My salad was good. Not $17 dollars good, but tasty none-the-less. The lamb was perfectly rare, just how I like it. The frisee definitely needed to be ripped up because the pieces were huge and I looked like The Beast, from Beauty and the Beast, when he was trying to learn to use a spoon, when I was trying to wrap my mouth around my fork filled with this mini frisee tree. Beau's hash looked like baby vomit on the plate once he deconstructed it and picked out the chicken. He left the sweet potato on the plate because he said it was too sweet.   After spending most of the time talking about the bizarre documentaries we watch on Netflix, it was time to go. When the waiter came with the bill, I told him there was no way we were paying after he assulted me by stepping on my foot. (haha) He said if that was the case that he would need to finish the job. I like it when waiters can play along like that. Beau took care of the bill and we left.   Was the food good? Yeah. But there's no way that it's worth the prices they're charging. It was nice to try but it's no where I'd be tripping over myself to go back to.",

I had a refreshing lime citrus martini while waiting and a couple minute prior to service, we were seated.   For appetizers, we ordered the delicious tiger shrimp roasted garlic corn tamale which had a beautiful balance of flavored. For dinner I had the Ancho-Chile Honey Glazed Salmon that was delicious but I have had salmon taste a bite better than what I had. There was not enough seasoning and the salmon was slightly over cooked.   My husband had the grilled porterhouse lamb chops which he absolutely could not hush about. He just had so many good things to say about it from the sauce to the accompaniment dish of plantain tamale. He had said that if he were to visit again, this would be the meal on his mind without hesitation.   We finished off with the crushed blueberry line tart which was a little to tart for my taste. I like subtle and balanced flavors so probably would have enjoyed it with maybe a bit of coconut milk. :)",

They told us that they are closing in an hour and the last call from the kitchen is in 30 mins, and we said that's fine, we'll make it fast. However she made it seem like it was a bother taking us in. We definitely didn't feel comfortable.   However the food was absolutely delicious!!! We got the steak, Lamb chops, and Lobster dish to try them all out. Steak was cooked perfectly and has lots of southern flavor. Lamb chops (hardest to cook this right) was cooked perfectly. The lobster dish had lots of flavor that just flows.   Would definitely recommend!!!! Maybe nicer hostess that will greet people properly and if you don't want to take anymore customers just say so in a nice way people will get it. Don't take people in and make it seem like we're a bother... Overall Great Food!!!",

The waiter was extremely pushy regarding the drinks and I felt as though he was constantly rushing us through ordering and our meal.  Appetizers were blue corn pancake with duck & blue corn lobster tacos. Both were OK. The duck was covered in a lot of sauce for my personal taste buds and was a touch boring. The taco was OK but very underwhelmed.  I ordered the filet medium and husband ordered the NY strip medium. It was explained to us that medium was PINK. My steak was medium rare. I told the waiter and he said that was what he told me. OK waiter person, whatever you say. I just wasn't in the mood to fight with him.  The sides were very good. The horseradish twice baked potato and the corn cojita.  Was disappointed in the dessert after just one bite.  Credit Card was authorized for the total of the bill $194.00. After tip the total was $244.00 and that was also authorized on the credit card.  The $244.00 was charged on 06/09/14. The authorization for $194.00 is still on my credit card as of 06/11/14.

All of us agreed that they were the best lamb chops we've had. We all agreed that next time we have to try different dishes. If the yare all as good, this place deserves six stars.",

    "text": "Review is for Spring 2012 Restaurant Week dinner:  I've been waiting awhile to try Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill and Restaurant Week seemed like the time to do it.  The appetizer and main course are on the regular menu.  Dessert is not listed on their website menu so this was a good sampler of the real thing at Mesa Grill.  On being seated, I was given the regular menu, a wine and cocktail menu, and the Restaurant Week menu.  My server, Rodil, was great with ordering and everything thereafter.  I ordered an iced tea and it was brought quickly followed by bread basket with a nice selection--two slices of jalapeno bread with a nice kick, a corn muffin, and two slices of raisin bread.  Accompanying the bread was softened butter.  I also tried the corn muffin.  It was good but a little dry.  The best thing about the muffin was the number of corn bits baked into it.  Still the jalapeno bread was my favorite.  For the first course, I ordered the blue corn pancake.  It was filled with duck and had a habanero chile-star anise sauce.  Rodil had alerted me that this wasn't spicy, but for a starter, I didn't care.  The second course was Flay's signature dish, New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin with a bourbon-ancho chile sauce and a sweet potato tamal which had a round of crushed pecan butter placed into the sweet potato/corn mixture to add liquid.  The pork was tender and cooked perfectly.  The spices rubbed on the pork gave it some great flavor and zing, and the ancho chile sauce was excellent--dark, rich, and very flavorful.  Rodil noticed that I was almost snorting the sauce and he asked if I wanted more, the pusher.  He brought a small round dish with extra ancho sauce.  I dipped my tenderloin in the sauce with abandon and joy!  The tamal was superb.  What an interesting twist on the common tamal.  My choice for dessert was Chocolate Bread Pudding with toasted bourbon marshmallow squares and graham cracker crisps on top.  The chocolate was semi-sweet and this was a fine ending to the meal.  It wasn't as sweet as most desserts and it complimented the flavors from the pork.  I had the best seat in the house in my mind.  I was near the back of the restaurant seated along a railing where I could watch the chefs do their work.  I had a good view of the grill where the steaks were cooked, and I could see into the salad/dessert preparation area.  Right near me was the staging area where two people oversaw the distribution of food.  When an order came in, they each got a copy and they both checked to see things were correct.  The person working on the outside nearest me wiped the dishes to remove any stray food so presentation was perfect.  I enjoyed the meal.  I was not hurried but things moved along at a good pace.  All the staff was efficient and pleasant.  This was a great meal to kick off the Spring 2012 Restaurant Week and I will be back!",

Nestled inside the Caesars Palace, Mesa Grill is one on Bobby Flay's establishments that has been around for quite sometime and the menu has changed quite a bit for its original. The steak and the chicken are delicious and the mini tamales are ridiculously good. Overall, a great restaurant in Vegas that I'd recommend trying at least once.

My group seemed to enjoy the place quite a lot so I'd still absolutely recommend it.  What I took exception to was that the New York strip I ordered was completely full of cartilage, super tough, and honestly, just a very bad strip. I've eaten all types of steaks from dozens of steak houses and the quality of this strip was no better, and maybe even worse than something you'd find at Outback or Applebee's. Not what you want to see at that price point.  My advice would be to go here, get the apps, get the desserts, and even get a steak. The ribeye looked great, the filet looked great (though spicy), but don't get the strip.",

For an appetizer I would recommend the Blue Corn Pancake.  It is barbecued duck and is quite yummy.  At bit costly for what you quite but your taste buds will be singing.      Best entrees are the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin, Chipotle Glazed Rib Eye Steak, & the Ancho Chile-Honey Glazed Salmon.    If you love southwestern cuisine, This place is a must try while in Vegas. You will not get any better then this.    Tip: This place is not normally a walk in type of dinning, you will need to make reservations to assure you can enjoy their great food.",

Portions are a bit small, but I expected that out of an establishment like this.  ________________________________________ Gala Apple Salad - literally little chunks of apples  Smoked Chicken & Bean Quesadilla - yum!  Yucatan Chicken Tacos - the chicken was smoked & flavorful. plus it's paired with a peanut smoked bbq sauce which is out of this world!   Rough-Cut Tuna Nachos - think of tuna tartar, its a platter of tuna and then a little bowl of chips. Honestly though the tuna is amazing by itself, and it a has a spicy kick to it. (I highly suggest ordering this one!)  Chorizo Meatballs - honestly, anything with chorizo is amazing  Cremini Mushroom Quesadilla - fontina, ricotta cheese, salsa verde and too top it off... a fried egg! (I highly suggest ordering this too, beyond flavorful, juicy & makes your tastebuds go crazzzzY) _________________________________________ Our server Michael rocked! Apparently he has been there since the opening of the Vegas establishment, so he is VERY informative of items on the menu, drinks and what not. He will even give you a mini story of Bobby Flay and answer any questions you may have. All the employees were so kind and helpful with all our needs & requests. I will be coming back here next time I'm in Vegas for some more appetizers, it's just enough to get your night started!  Side note: They only hold reservations for 15 mins & your entire party must be there to be seated.",

In other words, exhausted and ready to pass out (exactly how you should feel on the final morning before you fly out of Las Vegas).   I ordered the Sweet Potato hash, which resembles an egg benedict with a side of the mango glazed bacon and the creamy grits. The bacon was thick and cooked perfectly, but in the end bacon is bacon and there wasn't much reason for this bacon to cost what it does. But the grits were subtler in their spice level (I loved it). The spicy chicken eggs hash was the star of the show - spicy, sweet, and savory depending on the bite. I ate it as slowly as I could - heaven.   Lovely upscale decor with almost every table having a view of the \"kitchen show\" is a nice touch. But the tables are positioned too densely and strangely despite the restaurant being nearly empty another group was sat directly beside us.   It goes without saying that you are going to be paying quite a bit for the experience, but that's Vegas!",

At the end of it we were happy to pay the bill and add a generous tip as we felt we got more than our monies worth!  We were seated immediately having made reservations prior to our trip. Our request to be against a wall and not in the middle of the restaurant was granted, as we were in a corner with a view of the grill area and most of the establishment in front of us.   Our waiter Rodil arrived moments after we were seated providing information, water, and guidance with the menu. Turns out he was there as a server from day 1 in 2004.   Our appetizer came as advertised, and our dinner choices were excellent. Everything was well cooked, the wine pairing we decided upon almost perfect, and the service impeccable. The small details were all there, our water glasses topped up often with cold water and lots of ice.   Our wine was topped up many times, but never too much so that you felt that they were pushing another bottle your way to jack the bill up.   Overall our dinner at Mesa Grill was one of our favourite dining experiences to date.   They serve brunch and lunch as well. We went for brunch the day after our dinner and were just as impressed by the service, the food and the staff!  Five stars well earned. We wish we could add another review of our brunch as it was excellent.",

    "text": "This review has nothing to do with the service, wait staff or employees.  We were in Las Vegas for Thanksgiving and the place that we had planned on eating Thanksgiving dinner at didn't work out, so our family decided on eating here.  A Thanksgiving menu was offered for $39 per person...it consisted of turkey, chorizo stuffing, sweet potato and kale.  My mom and I both ordered it.  You could get mashed potatoes and gravy but it costs extra, in fact all the other side dishes cost extra. We also ordered a Cadillac margarita to drink.  Our Cadillac margaritas arrived and they literally tasted like sweet and sour mix, we tasted no alcohol and they were $16 each served in a small glass. Strike 1  Our turkey dinner arrived and it was gross! Extremely small portions.  The turkey was DRY, the cranberry relish had so many thick chunks of herbs, it was inedible, there was one tiny scoop of chorizo stuffing (it was just ok) , the sweet potatoes were this layered casserole style thing and flavorless, finally the kale...and I love kale but it tasted weird. Too many flavors going on in one dish. Strike 2  When we got back to the hotel room, I became very ill and the porcelain god was used. I will spare you the details.  Strike 3  Our other family members ordered other items off of the regular menu and had the same complaints about over seasoning and flavors that simply did not go together.  We won't be back.  I now realize why we were able to be seated right away.  That's because no one else in Vegas wanted to eat Thanksgiving dinner there.",

Sixteen spiced chicken with cilantro pesto mashed potatoes- hmmm...it was good.  And Chocolate + Berry Shortcake-  It was ok... not too sweet.  So a perfect end to a nice meal.  I think it was value priced.  I will probably go back on my next trip and try something else different.  The bartender Efram was a pleasure to chat with and very informative.",

The restaurant also features a surprisingly terrific bread selection. Prices are not cheap, but by Vegas standards are fairly reasonable.

    "text": "First off, no beans ad hats inside the restaurant. As the name brand, food here is great overall as expected. We ordered Mesa burger, spicy chicken+sweet potato hash, crispy bacon+hash brown quesadilla and new Mexican spiced pork tenderloin sandwich. Mesa burger was juicy and tender right to my taste (4.5/5). Spicy chicken+sweet potato hash had an excellent texture, it was moist and creamy. It was very nicely plated (5/5). When I first saw the crispy bacon+hash brown quesadilla in my table, it looked dry and kinda roasted to me. However, that was deceiving as it tasted just the opposite. It was crispy yet bit of a moistness was there (5/5). The last dish new Mexican spiced pork tenderloin sandwich was not to my taste. For my taste, meat was undercooked; I wished they would have asked me how I like my meat. Lots of herbs on this dish; I don't like arugula and all. I know bad order on my part! Not for the herbs but for the meat and overall taste I'd give 2.5/5. By the way, the fries that came with the burger and sandwich was the highlight!! I'm drooling now at the thought of those fries. The chef told us that they use a special spice on their fries which is Bobby Flay's secret recipe and even the chef doesn't know.:)  For a restaurant inside Caesar Palace and Bobby Flay's name, imo they are reasonably priced. I must say their service was exceptional. The chef kept checking on us, and made nice friendly conversation with us. Really loved the whole experience.",

    "text": "4.5 stars! By far the most awesome meal I had during my previously weekend visig in Las Vegas.  I have had secret infatuation with Bobby Flay on Food Network for a while now. Although he's a little bit older...his bad boy look and abilities to cook+entertain impressed me. Aside from his unofficial fling with Giada, I still wanted to give him a chance during my visit in Law Vegas...so my SO and I booked a spot to check Mesa Grill out while we were in town.  We opted for tiger prawns and tamale for an appetizer and chose the veal chops and cuffed rubbed filet mignon for dinner (added on a side of cilantro and pesto mashed potatoes). It didn't hurt that the waitress also have us a complementary basket of yummy bread, too (the corn/jalapenos muffin was devine!). The meats (veal and filet mignon) were cooked perfectly. They were both very tender. Although we tend to eat our steak medium rare..but because the waitress let us know that their chef tended to cook on a rarer side...we asked for medium for our meats instead...and just like what we expected..the meats came out perfect...still juicy and tender!  Overall, the dinner was very pleasant. We finished our meal with banana cream pie and it was a good choice for yam it wasn't too heavy and still enough to share between the two of us.  Overall, I would definitely want to return to this place again. It also does help that Bobby Flat hasn't remarried yet either :p from what I overheard from the waitress was that he comes visit his restaurants in Vegas about 6 times a year..so hopefully next time we will be able to get a glimpse of him!  -0.5 stars for just plain ok sides and desserts. Their appetizers and main courses were great and had a variety of selection. For the side dishes to complement the entrees...as well as the desserts though...the choices seemed too plain to me...but then again..Bobby isn't exactly known as a dessert guy either! Highly recommended!",

    "text": "3.5  After a fun typical Vegas night, our party of four craved a casual and sinfully \"fatty\" place for brunch but not a fast-food restaurant. I'm not usually into cheeky TV celebrity chef restaurants, but was pleasantly surprised by a couple of items at Mesa Grill. Caesars Palace is also not our cup of tea, but the location worked with our schedule that day. Off to Mesa Grill we went!   Browns and golden tones rule the decor with minimal pops of primary colored accents added for interest. The white tablecloths formalize its look. Note: my husband was asked to remove his cap upon entering. Not a problem, I'm cool with that, but be warned.   Our party was seated immediately upon arrival, but then it took forever to iron out drinks and our order. Quality table service is not Mesa's strength. Ultimately, the food mostly turned out to be what we needed. We started with the savory complimentary biscuits, muffins, and jalapeno corn-bread as well as the GOAT CHEESE QUESO FUNDIDO. Loved them all! I had the SPICY CHICKEN & SWEET POTATO HASH with the poached eggs: just the level of hot I enjoy by the green chile hollandaise. Our friends ordered the GREEN CHILE CHEESEBURGER which came correctly cooked at the temperature requested. They raved about its taste and loved the fries as well. Only the RANCH STYLE EGGS TOSTADA fell a little flat compared to the rest. The \"fresh\" orange juice tasted as if right out of a carton, so we, unfortunately, sent those back. Lastly, the double espresso arrived piping hot and as bold as I like.   I wouldn't go out of my way to return to Mesa, but I would be open to giving it another go if in the area or if one opened near me.",

It was outstanding and had a nice kick with the dabs of habenero sauce. Probably the best pork tenderloin dish I've ever had.  A friend got the famous chicken dish there and it was terrific as well.

He needs to take a page out of Daniel Boulud's book.    D- $16+ for a margarita in a half filled martini glass, can we say rip off?  E- $96 for lunch is ridiculous, even in Vegas.  This was Bobby Flay, NOT Joel Robuchon.  ----- Part of me feels like I have really high expectations being from NY and getting to experience REAL Flay at its best.  But next time I'm in Caesar's I will be hitting up Spago.  The wait staff was attentive, and nice.  The hostess was unattractive, and had quite an attitude.    If you have never been to a Flay restaurant, I suggest you give it a go when you come to vegas, but if you're looking for mind blowing food- and something to write home to, this is not it.",

Service: 5 stars They were attentive and removed plates properly. When my BF didnt touch his entree they noticed and took it off. Cost: 4 stars. way pricey yo.    Ordered: Sophie's Chopped Salad with her own Special Dressing + Crispy Tortillas 12. This was good, but hell, i can get this anywhere Spicy Tuna Tartare with Blistered Serrano Chile Hot Sauce + Avocado Relish 14. one of the best  ive ever had. this one was demolished in 3 minutes, fer serious. New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin with Bourbon-Ancho Chile Sauce + Sweet Potato Tamale with Crushed Pecan Butter 31. This was my dish. good portions. love love love the tamale. it was sweet and moist.  Yellow Corn Crusted Chile Relleno Filled with Wild Mushrooms + Goat Cheese + Served with a Salad of Grilled Vegetables with White Truffle Oil 23. this was instantly rejected by my BF and he loves chile rellenos. Southwestern Fries-$7  these were tasty enough but $7 squash blossoms- deepfried and gooood. only came with 2 or 3 not enough to share. Quesadilla- overly cheesie. strangely sub par.  Pros: the sweet potato tamale. great pork tenderloin, tuna tartare  Cons: pricey, not many veggie options.  Overall: we couldnt wait to return. i dream about these tamales at night.",

    "text": "I rate restaurants on four things: the food I eat, the way I am treated, how comfortable the environment is while I'm eating, and how much all of this costs.  This means I don't eat at a restaurant because a celebrity is associated with it, and therefore any feelings I may have - positive or otherwise - in regard to said celebrity, don't mess with my meal. Good food is a serious business.  It should never be adulterated with bile.   THE FOOD After consulting with the waiter, I ordered a cocktail... a Cactus Pear Margarita, a Blue Corn Pancake appetizer, and the Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash.    The Cactus Pear Margarita (Herradura Silver Tequila, cactus pear syrup and lime juice) had a strong background flavor of grapefruit, which was not to my taste.  The replacement drink was a White Peach Margarita (white peach puree, Herradura Silver Tequila, lime juice).  It was exquisite.  A perfect balance of flavors.  Not too sweet.  Not too sour.  Not excessively fruity.    Meanwhile I had the bread basket to explore. It included three breads; a jalapeno cornbread muffin, a slice of nutty whole wheat, and a few wedges of light as air foccacia.  Okay... the muffin was actually the highlight of my entire day.  Maybe several days.  Crumbly, salty sweet, just spicy enough to be interesting.  I immediately wanted a dozen more, and my appetizer hadn't even arrived.  Later I sampled the whole wheat - which was somewhat pedestrian after the muffin, and the foccacia - another delicious surprise.  I could have dined on bread alone and gone away full and happy.  But more was to come.    The Blue Corn Pancake is just that, a blue corn pancake filled with barbecued duck, topped with at least three sauces, including the habanero chile and star anise listed on the menu.  The blend of flavors was powerful, exotic, and extremely rich.  People who cannot or don't care for spicy foods should avoid this dish.  The heat of the smoky sweet barbecued duck was balanced with the mild blue corn, then kicked again into high gear with the sauces.  Wow!  The Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash was... well, interesting.  Topped with a poached egg the combination was relatively mild.  The consistency of the whole dish was soft, almost deceptively so, because the sauces drizzled over the dish were quite spicy. I ate half and brought the rest of it home to Los Angeles to eat later.  It was actually better tasting when I heated it up the next day.    Since I was taking leftovers home, I went ahead and ordered a dessert.  The waiter and I spent some time talking about what would travel well, eventually settling on the Smoked Vanilla & Toasted Walnut Flan.  Actually, it was a coffee flavored flan with a smoky vanilla caramel top and some candied walnuts on the side. I may sound more blase than I feel, but the description on the dessert menu just did not do it justice.  Even after being hauled onto a plane and stuck in a refrigerator for a day, the flan was creamy, subtly flavored, and absolutely splendid.   In fact, the whole meal was a five star experience.  It takes a truly superb kitchen to create the effortless complexity of flavor and presentation I got at Mesa.  THE SERVICE I had my luggage with me when I came into the restaurant and the Greeter immediately offered to put it aside in a private locked closet. Although she didn't give me a claim ticket, she did recognize me when I left.  I did wonder how that all works when the restaurant is particularly busy.  As you can tell already, I take up a waiter's time.  I expect them to be knowledgeable about the menu, familiar with the dishes, and to have an opinion (their favorites).  I did not order the waiter's favorites, but any really good waiter appreciates fine food and WILL have at least one dish on the menu that they rave about.  Great restaurants hire great waiters.  Mesa Grill gets five stars here as well.  Not only did I have a great waiter, I had two, plus a busboy who might as well have been a third, and a personable bartender who brought me my second drink ... AND STOOD THERE waiting to make sure I was happy with it.   Mind you, I was there at 1:30 in the afternoon on a Monday.  So most people should not expect to get quite this level of attention, but I have no doubt that these guys are steller even at the most hectic of times. I really put them to the test at the end. I asked to have the hash and a couple of those amazing muffins packed along with the flan.  Then I had them repack it so that I could fit it into my carry on bag.  No fuss.  No looks.  Just whatever help I seemed to need.  (many thanks Joel, Dario & Adam!)   I would write a longer review, but I have run out of room.  Let me just say that the environment was excellent (quiet, light enough to see, but not too bright, and the bathroom was clean), and the bill, including tip was under $75.  For this level of restaurant, that's dirt cheap.",

Also, your entire group needs to be there before they seat you.  The hostesses aren't the best, but whatever.  It's rare that I find a hostess station that I would say has great service.    The steaks are enormous, so I like to find someone willing to share.  The Jalapeno Cheese Bread is so good you have to hold back to save room for the actual meal.  This time I had the Wild Mushroom Grits.  It was spicier than I anticipated, but I love spicy foods so it was a pleasant surprise!  And the pork tenderloin was wonderful, and cooked to perfection. Oh and the Red Apple Martini, so yummy!    Our server Michael was fabulous as always!  He is definitely part of the reason we keep going back!  I love a server who can make us laugh and seem to be having just as good a time as we are!",

I ordered the New York and it was ok nothing special i also ordered the $8 sides the corn which was great and the twice baked potato that was terrible i didn't even finish it there was horseradish mixed in it and some orange sauce across the top which really threw me off.   My man ordered the pork loin and it sucked the sauces that they put on the meat is all you can taste and it made it nasty the same thing with the filet mignon. The cioppino was in a green cilantro sauce and all you get is a little bowl.   I would never eat here again it is definitely a rip off it didn't even taste good at all i was not impressed.",

I've been here twice, let me break down the experiences.  1)  Had the 22 ounce bone in rib eye.  Meat = perfect(I got medium), Sauces = perfect complements, and pre-dinner bread = bomb.  There was a side that I'm not too sure if they still serve for dinner, but it was some kind  of corn dish, and it was AMAZING.  All in all, worthy of the 60+ $ spent to enjoy high class cookery.  2)  Had to hit it up for some BRUNCH, YO! A group of us all ordered different things and all dishes were amazingly unique for being brunch type dishes.  I got the Burger, and for only a couple more bucks than a Denny's burger, it was worth it.  Friends got the chilequiles(bomb) and enchiladas(bomb).  Others ordered too but didn't get a chance to try them all.  Again, the bread was very good to start out with.  One con... PEPSI is served here... =/  A coke would have made this meal exponentially better.  Anyways,  I recommend it completely if you have not experienced it!",

Shared the pork tenderloin with 8 rubbed spices, extremely tender and flavorful.  Side of grilled sweet corn off the cob with a cream mixed in that was yummy!  Dessert was churros dusted with anise with a dark chocolate dipping sauce and a coconut dipping sauce. Great way to end the meal! Definitely recommend this restaurant!",

    "text": "A group of us travels to Vegas each year in search of old NAB friends and dining fun.  We have had many superb lunches, but this dinner fell flat.  The appetizers were fine, which made the main courses that much more disappointing.  Our group ordered:  The chile-crusted rabbit with a bedding of cous-cous -- the rabbit was cooked perfectly, but the natural flavor of the protein could not be discerned.  I've had a fair bit of rabbit and red squirrel in my day, and enjoy the flavors; our dining companion did not get that chance, the flavor was lost in his dish.  Another of our group had the Mahi-Mahi and declared it well cooked but under-seasoned.    The third member of our table had the evening's special, the arctic char.  It was perfectly cooked with the skin crisped expertly and presented skin-up to preserve the texture.  The flavor of the protein was the star of this dish and we declared this the only success of the night.  I had the pork tenderloin.  Eager to ease into the palate of flavors (boubon sauce, a touch of the habenero drizzle) I started with just a piece of the pork.  The rub utterly masked any porky goodness and left a sort-of spicy dirt aftertaste.  By cutting a piece of pork, ensuring a light coating of the bourbon sauce and a dash of the habenero sauce, I could \"get\" what the creator of the recipe had in mind.  Sadly, you could have rubbed a piece of soggy cardboard and then dipped the sauces to pretty much good effect.  Unfortunately, I wanted a wonderful protein to be the star, enhanced by some clever sauce choices.  The sweet potato tamale needed something to cut the cloying sweetness (yes, I know they're called sweet potatoes for a reason).  This might have been a one-star event, were it not for the skilled wait and bus staff and the wonderful arctic char.  For at least these reasons, we'll be taking Mesa Grill off our dining destination rotation in the future.",

When we asked the host, he was extremely rude telling us that the sign says 10pm. We informed him that we called ahead and he stated once more for us to look at the sign, even though over the phone 2 hours prior we were told something different. Never again will I recommend this establishment. Bobby obviously doesn't care as much about people and customer service as he does being on TV.

Despite one of my friends disdain for Bobby Flay's personality as it appears on television, I was able to convince her and two others to join me for lunch at Mesa by promising an incredible meal.  Unfortunately Mesa didn't deliver that incredible meal, so I failed to follow through with my promise.  Possibly the most disappointing was the bbq duck crepes.  On paper it sounds marvelous, but it actually tastes like an Ar-B-Q sandwich from Arby's -- honestly indiscernible.  There were more failures however.  While glazing things with miso has recently become popular, Mesa would not be a reason for this, as their miso-glazed salmon was absolutely terrible.  It has an odor reminiscent of ammonia, and a flavor that nearly matched.  We continued with our gastronomical hopes of grandeur but were continuously let down.  Some items were so forgettable, that I've actually forgotten all the different dishes we ate.  One dish in particular comes to mind as probably the second most disappointing of the meal; the sweet potato and duck hash.  Appealing in name, but the final product does not deliver.  The texture of the sweet potato was closer to baby food than to that of a hash, and the duck's flavor was smothered by the remnants of sweet potato suffocating my taste buds.  Overpriced hype.  Bobby Flay, I challenge you to a throwdown.",

    "text": "After eating at Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill in Ceasar's Palace, I'm pretty sure I would allow Flay to \"throwdown\" on me anytime he wants. His food a seriously sexy and  unforgettable \"explosion\" of flavors in my mouth again and again. Woowee! It's getting hot in here, and it's not just because of his masterful use of spices. But let's move onto the food.  I went to Vegas this past weekend, and was excited to find that the people I went to didn't want to just go to the plethora of buffets that Vegas has to offer. Instead, our group ventured into the culinary adventures that Vegas had to offer, and our first stop was Mesa Grill.  Three things about me: 1) i love spicy foods 2) i typically do not like bloody mary's (in fact, i detest them) 3) i never get red meat past medium. (pink is where its at)  We ordered our drinks first, I ordered the margarita (which was just ok, BUT when I asked for extra tequila, the server hooked a sister up!) My other fellow food goers both ordered bloody marys. I tried a sip, and I swear I was in spicy tomato heaven. It was the best bloody bloody mary I've ever had, and I actually REGRETTED not ordering one for myself. Score 1 for Bobby Flay!  Next, our server set down a bounty of delicious baked goods. (good thing because we were starving) Now usually, the bread is usually just ok and filler food til the meal comes. The basket alone could have made up a meal, and I would have been perfectly content. (just goes to show you how serious they take food) The assortment came with jalepeno corn muffins and biscuits, cranberry scones, blueberry coffee cake, and the best part was that they gave us three of each because there were three of us! Now that's dedication!  Next, the three of us ordered the Mesa Burger, Scrambled Egg Enchilada, and the Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash with Poached Eggs.   My burger came with fries dusted with a southwestern seasoning (ancho chili powder, and probably some cayenne). The fries were delectably spicy and the burger was cooked medium (with the perfect pink center) score 2 more points for Flay.  The burger was HUGE accompanied by tasty grilled onions, swiss cheese, and a side of horseradish mustard. I could have stopped here, and Flay would have exceeded my expectations, but he was definitely not through with me yet.   Next the Scrambled Egg Enchiladas. Scrambled eggs with chorizo and goat cheese rolled in tortillas, and assembled on top of three different sauces. The great thing I loved about this was that it was not drenched with sauce like your typical enchilada. Instead, there were three intricate sauces (all sure to stimulate your taste buds), that went well with the delicate eggs. Scrumptious!  I was perfectly satisfied, but Flay insisted \"to keep on going\" and make the experience \"last a little longer.\"  I had to try the Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash. I was unsure about the dish- thought the sweet potatoes might have been overkill. However, I took a bite, and I was in food heaven. It was everything you want in a meal. Well balanced flavors, perfectly seasoned, and not too heavy.  I was so full, but I couldn't stop eating. I wanted more. I needed more. It was the perfect climatic end to a delicious meal.   As Rhett S. said, if you go to Vegas and have not made it to Mesa, you havent really experienced Vegas at all.  I would drive 4 hours just to try it again!",

Hubs is always down for din-din.)  We thought \"Hey, it's a random Monday night, we won't need reservations.\" Well, we thought wrong. We got there at around 7pm and their first available seating for 2 was at 9:30. No thanks. (Note: Next time make reservations) Our option was to eat dinner at the bar, so we decided to do that. This was a good choice...about 30 minutes later the bar was totally full and we would have had no choice but to wait.   Any-hoo, we loved our meal. I had a mojito, we split the Tiger Shrimp and Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale as a starter. It's one of my boyfriend Bobby Flay's signature dishes and it was supper tasty. Then for dinner I had the Sixteen Spice Crusted Chicken (I don't really eat fish or red meat. Yet, I really wanted to eat here. It's amazing what a crush will make a girl do.) and hubs had the Mahi Mahi. He's bummed he didn't get a steak...I don't know what his problem was, but he said he didn't see the steaks on the menu. WTF?! Oh, and we shared a side of corn as suggested by the bartender.   We loved ALL of our food. The flavor in everything was amazing and we were pretty much licking the plate. I'm not a foodie by any stretch of the imagination. I don't know how to describe all the flavors. For me there is bad, okay, good and really good. This was all really good. Mmm.   I also enjoyed the decor of the place. Hubs and I had fun spotting the subtle flame decor spattered here and there.   My crush is now worse than ever. Maybe I'll start eating fish and red meat just so I can eat there again and try something new.",

Some of the best service I have ever experienced. This is including the bus boy.  We started with the Prawn Tamale appetizer which was cooked to perfection. The masa corn mix was perfectly flavored.  I ordered the 15 spice chicken with mango salsa. This was tender and a large portion. My sides were mashed potatoes and the blue cheese corn side which was so so so delicious.  I had a view of the kitchen, it was hard for me to tell how the dishes are transfered from the kitchen to the wait staff, it looked confusing to me. Last time we were here something happened and while I was served my pork loin dish after 20 minutes and my hubby was served his steak dish which turned cold. Its almost as if another waiter took my dish for another table at the time and his dish sat awhile.   They handled the situation well at the time. This is why I waited for my second visit to review it, I love the food.",

    "text": "Became a fan of Bobby Flay when he challenged Iron Chef Morimoto in the Japanese version of Iron Chef. :)  fun, corny show and it always made us hungry.  Flay's southwestern style made us curious enough to pay the celebrity chef premium for lunch.  Husband had the Mesa Burger and didn't think it was very Bobby Flay.  I very much enjoyed the pork tenderloin sandwich.   It reminded me of watching Bobby on his Throw-down challenges.  The sandwhich could have been very Americana, or Asian fusion, or whatever.  At Mesa Grill, it was fresh, tender, and southwestern.  I'd order it again if we return.  The bread basket was great.  My favorite was the jalapeno corn muffin, which apparently also had blue corn on the bottom half.  Very moist and flavorful.  My son didn't like the raisin walnut bread so I got to try that too....great, especially with butter.  Dessert: disappointed to learn the churros with assorted dipping sauces  were not available at lunch. Had the sticky toffee pudding (like eating bread pudding) with salted cajeta and vanilla bean ice cream.  It was delicious.  Husband said the salted cajeta adds too much salt for his taste.  I liked it, but I also like sea salt cupcakes and salted coffee more than he does.  Kids had \"kids' cheeseburger\"   They were both impressed with it's size and double cheese.  They both took at least half back to our resort to finish at dinnertime.  They've never had $12 kids' burgers before.     I also had the specialty margarita.  Expensive, but I'm glad I invested in the treat.   Our lunch bill was just shy of $100, plus a decent tip, as the service was very good.  I agree with another reviewer who said the host at the front was very indifferent, but our server was quite the opposite.....attentive and good with our kids.",

Very knowledgeable about the menu and what was safe for us to eat.  Kudos to Bobby Flay and the cooks for making Mesa Grill a VERY celiac-friendly restaurant. We had great salads (chopped and apple), a few fantastic custom margaritas, a NY strip, pork, sweet potatoes au gratin, sauteed spinach, shrimp and lobster tamales, chicken skewers and banana cream pie. Yikes. A great blend of sophisticated flavors.  Second time here. Excellent both times.  Well done. Really great food and excellent service.",

Just watching the place operate was exciting.  We wanted to try a few different things so instead of getting a big entree we shared two apps, the Tiger shrimp and roasted garlic corn tamale (awesome), the Blue corn pancake with barbecued duck (good but I found the duck a little tough) then a side of their roasted corn chipotle aioli, lime, and cotija cheese (amazing).  Everything came to the table piping hot which I love.    The only thing that stops me from a 5 star rating is the cocktail.  I ordered the Mesa original margarita.  I wasn't able to finish it because it had way too much lime juice.  I couldn't even taste the tequila so that part was a bummer.",

    "text": "I normally don't go to big restaurants in Vegas. Usually we eat cheap (because we lose and have to dish it out at clubs) or we go to the buffets for the grand experience.  This will be the first of many.  We went in a party of 7 around 530 to beat a rush (if any). Though there dress code is pretty casual, sleeves are a must (no bro tanks here). We had a reservation that was made a couple days prior and got seated right when the last one of us had arrived. We were greeted by our waiter who pretty much gave us the lowdown on the menu. As someone on our group said, there probably could have been a whole powerpoint presentation on the information he gave us.   No complaints about the service. Waiter came around early and often. He even brought backup just to refill water.  Food: Was great. To be honest, I haven't tried pricey steaks so often but that New York strip was good. I tried my friend's rib-eye and DO RECOMMEND that one over the strip. Overall, you're paying that much for a steak so it better be good, right? We also started with the blue corn pancake (with duck inside). I would have liked to be bigger, but it seems like its a trend that the appetizers are appetizer size. The duck was very tender and flavorful though. I do recommend the tamale. It will be unlike any tamale you have ever eaten...trust me on that one. As for a side, the waiter recommended the roasted corn chipotle aioli which was fantastic.   Price: Well it's Bobby Flay. \"Pay him. Pay him his money\"  Bobby Flay did it right. Iron Chef, we'll meet again someday.",

    "text": "Despite being curious about Bobby Flay's food, we'd stayed away from Mesa Grill for years because of that dreaded adjective: BUSINESS, as in Business Casual. Mike likes his jeans. I like my comfortable shoes.  So I had to do a triple-take when, in the course of scouting out Michelin-rated restaurants, I saw that Mesa Grill's Yelp entry had been changed to just \"Casual.\" Really? Get your jeans on, honey!  Now, if only I had done a triple-take at my Michelin list and realized that it was from 2008. Mesa Grill lost their star - Chef Bobby Flay's only Michelin star - in 2009. Oops! Oh well, here in 2012 we like Yelp stars better anyway, don't we?  Lunch (12:30ish) was busy, with many patrons looking like they were brokering some kind of big shoulder pads deal at the table, but there were also plenty of tourists wearing \"ordinary\" clothes - nice jeans or pants, nondescript shirts, etc. One guy at the bar had a baseball cap on. A woman at the bar was dressed for a Pussycat Dolls audition. The typical range of casino couture.  We only had to wait a few minutes before we were seated at one of the many two-tops on the upper elevations in the restaurant.  \"Remember those tables on our last cruise?\" Mike asked. He meant the ones where you could hug the people at the next table without hardly stretching. The closeness of these tables at Mesa Grill was disappointing, and next time I'd wait for something a little more to the side, or for a four-top when things are less busy. Being distracted by our neighbours' conversations as well as repeating ourselves in \"safe to be broadcasted\" murmurs is not part of my ideal dining experience.  The good news is that the food is so delicious that I can't wait to go back.   Our meal started with a complimentary bread basket: Jalapeno Asiago, Corn Muffin, and Raisin Bread.  I figured the corn muffin, a yin-yang mix of yellow and blue corn meal, would be the best. Mesa Grill specializes in southwestern cuisine, after all.  Meh, it was okay. A bit flat. Maybe a tiny-tiny bit metallic? Then I tried the jalapeno and asiago slice.  Oh-Em-Geezers. A-MAAAA-ZING!  How could this unassuming white, porous, fluffy bread pack so much sharp and sour flavour with a crusty edge?  I only had a little nibble of the raisin bread (sweet crumb, very bitter crust) because our appetizers arrived. Chicken and Black Bean Quesadillas for Mike, Cremini Mushroom Quesadillas for me.  Two words I could just copy and paste 100x into this review would be \"subtlety\" and \"layers.\" With every bite of everything we ordered at Mesa Grill there would be a new flavour to discover. I'm sure I ate half the meal with my head cocked as I tried to taste everything that had gone into the dishes.  Nobody adores cheese more than I do, and I know some people have criticized Mesa Grill for not offering very cheesy fare, but my quesadilla was perfectly \"cheesed.\" In fact, I kept peeking inside until I could figure it out, but the cheese was melted in such a way to completely cover and blend with the tortilla to create what I thought at first was just a thick bottom tortilla. Harmony: Mesa Grill does it.  Contrasting this pillow bottom was an overall crispiness. Crispy, but not burnt whatsoever. (I don't like even a suggestion of burnt taste.) Between the perfect cheese, the crunch, the light layer of mushrooms that didn't dominate the dish, and the yummy dollops of cream on top of each quarter-slice, how is there any praise left for the fried egg on top?  Oh, but there must be, because this was genius. The fried egg just added a very simple \"edge\" to the quesadilla's taste without interfering with any of the flavours already going on.  My stomach was full and my heart was broken that I couldn't eat my last three bites, but we did have main courses coming. Gah! (Next time I'll just get a starter and dessert and skip the corn muffin. There was absolutely no room for any of the exciting dessert options on this trip.)  Mike had ordered the Yucatan Chicken Tacos, which are an interpretation of satay sticks with tortillas and peanut-chile sauce. (I'll let him talk these up in his own review.) I ordered the only vegetarian item in the \"main dish\" section: the Cornmeal-Crusted Chile Relleno. (Note: there are more vegetarian appetizers.)  Often I find chile rellenos too greasy or samey or gloopy, but they can be good. I wanted to see what Flay's people would do.  Short version: it was the best chile relleno I've had in my life... and I say this even though I thought the cornmeal coat was absolutely bland if not a bit yucky. (If there was any seasoning, I couldn't taste it.) But once I peeled that back, the chile itself (and all the complex cheesy yumness inside) was delicious. With the herbs on top and drizzled sauces underneath, every bite was just as intriguing and new as with the quesadilla.  Yelp says I'm out of characters, so I'll just say this: Michelin needs to bring back the Las Vegas guide and bring back Bobby's star.",

For $30 dollars I got 3 semi-decent tacos.  I am from California and can get tacos of the same caliber for $2 a piece.  However I will admit the corn flavored sauce that accompanied the tacos was amazing.  The salmon was very good but not equal in comparison to the price charged.  I understand this a gourmet restaurant but for the price charged I could easily find a hole in the wall restaurant that serves foodies just as good.

It was about 630pm and we were a walk-in party of 4 and were seated at the last open table available. The party behind us were told they would have to come back at 9pm. Once seated, our waitress asked us if we had a show to get to or any other time commitments. We told her we had a show at 8pm. She told us that she'd try to get us out in time and that we could probably only order an entree.   A lot of the items on the menu were tex mex or some rendition of a Mexican dish. A lot of them also had a spice rub or something on the side with a kick to it. We ordered the lamb chops, veal chops, the sixteen spice chicken and the tuna steak. I had the lamb chops and they came out just right. The tomatillo on the side was a great addition. The cuts of meat were just enough, not too much and not too little. Cooked perfect to my liking. Although I'm not a big fan of spicy foods, the balance of flavors and spice was tolerable. I wasn't overly impressed by our meal but I was also not disappointed. I recommend checking it out if you like this type of cuisine.",

    "text": "We were gonna have sushi, but someone recommended this place before the Celine concert and we LOVED it.  We started with the Blue Corn Pancake appetizer and though a bit small, it had enough flavor to dislocate your jaw.  The flavor was rich and the duck portion relative to the pancake was generous, so it didn't feel starchy.  I had the Mango and Spice Crusted Tuna Steak and it was cooked perfectly (the less cooked the better) with a light crust and a delicious mango cous cous bed.  The portion was a hefty portion considering it was a slab of sashimi grade ahi.  My girlfriend had the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin.  The dish was served as three pillars of tenderloin, each cooked and seasoned perfectly with a slightly spicy south american spiced rub that you would expect from a dish of that name.  The only down side was when we found out that the waiter had charged the entire bill and didn't take into account the $50 dining credit we had.  We only became aware of it because we got an email about the charge from the credit card company after it went through.  When we asked the waiter to clarify, he said he only charged the remainder of the bill even though the email from the credit card company clearly showed the entire bill amount.  I thought it was pretty lame on the part of the waiter to lie, but the credit card company said it was documented so we didn't have to worry above and beyond the receipt that showed the accurate amount.  Happy Eating!",

Whenever I was seated I was disappointed to get the brunch menu instead of the normal lunch menu.  That meant no chile relleno that I had picked out earlier.  Instead I decided upon the 16 spice chicken salad with a side of chorizo. The salad was plated beautifully and the first bite of chicken provided my palate with the many spices.  Sadly I soon lost those spices in the rest of the salad.  It had a green onion  vinaigrette dressing on top with goat cheese and fancy lettuce.  Overall, I really enjoyed the salad.  The chorizo was also good but a bit overcooked.  It started out with a slightly sweet taste before finishing off spicy.  The bottom line for me is that I will head back here again in the future the next time that I am in Vegas.  All of my previous meals here I would have given 5 stars but this time it was only worthy of 4.",

    "text": "I brought my honey to Vegas last week and introduced him to the Mesa Grill.  He liked it so much that he asked me to cancel my reservations for the next evening and to just make another reservation here.  So, we ate there two nights in a row.  We have no shame.  The first night, we had goat cheese queso fundido and the lamb porterhouse, with cactus pear margaritas, and shared two desserts - the coconut cake and the chocolate bread pudding.  The queso fundido was even better than I remembered it.  I *love* this appetizer.  I could not get every little bit of cheese off the iron dish and that made me sad.     The lamb was probably the best lamb we've ever had (and I'm a connoisseur of lamb, it is one of my favorite dishes.  The marinade was perfect - just a hint of mint and a hint of vinegar, not overwhelming at all, and I kept trying to sop up every little bit from my plate.  You get two thick steaks with the order, quite red in the center but absolutely delicious.  It comes with a goat cheese / chorizo tamale which is pretty good (not as good as the shrimp tamale appetizer but still good).  The margaritas were good, but aside from being pink I didn't discern any particular flavor other than your normal lime margarita flavor.  Of the desserts we liked the coconut cake a lot but weren't too keen on the bread pudding as it was very bitter.  The coconut cake was a very large portion, easily split between 2-3 people.  Our server on the first night was excellent.  The second night we ordered the queso fundido again along with the duck pancake for appetizers.  I had the lamb again, my honey had the ribeye.  We skipped dessert and drinks.  The duck pancake we didn't find that exciting - it reminded my honey of barbeque pulled pork that we had recently but for much cheaper.  It tasted fine but you can do much better here.  The ribeye was good, honey was happy with it - though we both preferred the lamb.  Our server the second night was fine but nothing standout.  I think he actually disappeared partway through the meal and got replaced by someone else.  I am upping my rating to 5 stars even though there were a few duds on the menu because between the lamb, queso fundido, shrimp tamale and the coconut cake one can get an amazing 5 star meal.",

    "text": "Have dined here two other times, both of which included Bobby Flay burgers which are very very good!   This time we were on East Coast time, starving  with the fall-back time change, we had an extra long wait for them to open on a recent Sunday morning.  Finally they opened and we got in the line that had suddenly cropped up hoping we didn't need reservations.  After a short wait, we were led to a small table for two.  Our waiter was very friendly and efficient, but I don't know that he actually HEARD what we said to him.  After explaining the difference in their three signature margaritas, having had the peach one before (which he described as sour), I ordered that, and husband went for coffee.  Waiter was very very right...this drink tasted like pure sour mix.  I couldn't taste the peach at all, unlike the past when I've had it and it was very peachy.  I even questioned him about whether he had brought the right drink.  He assured me it was the right drink and I drank it doggone it...it was my duty!  Although I do remember what it USED to taste like.  Just sayin' Bobby!  TIP TIP TIP:  SHARE meals here.  Share appetizers/meals/salads whatever.  I wish we had done that, but we were both so hungry that we each ordered entrees.  I opted for:    SP I C Y  CH I C K E N  + SW  E E T  PO T  A  T  O  HA S H P o a c h e d   E g g s     +   G r e e n   C h i l e  H o l l a n d a i s e  $18  Husband went with:  RA N C H   ST Y L E   EG G S   TO S T  A  D A C r i s p y   F l o u r   T o r t i l l a     A n c h o   C  h  i l e   -   T  o m  a t  o   S a u c  e     +   W h i t e   C h e d d a r   C h e e s e  $16.  We were brought a basket of great baked goods that included adorable and delicious tiny jalapeno biscuits, Bobby's usual blue cornbread muffin (which always falls apart when try to eat it, but is more moist than it used to be) and a delicious blueberry baked something.  Husband's coffee was excellent!    And out came the entrees.  Both were HUGE.  If only Husband did poached eggs maybe we could've shared, but he doesn't so all I got was a taste of his, and he took a taste of mine then dove back into his.  Mine was really good, but Waiter had said it was the spiciest thing on the menu (6 out of 10 he said).  I had said bring on the spice.  I would give it maybe a 2 out of 10 on the spicy scale.  It was good, but would've loved a small amount of it along with something else.  It was too much of one thing.  Husband's dish that sounded so plain and ordinary was fabulous!  (at least the one bite I got).  In hindsight, I would recommend sharing a couple different things.    Am still a fan of Mesa Grill and would not hesitate to go back, but would order differently in the future. And sincerely hope they fix the peach problem!",

Mesa has in my opinion declined since my last visit a few years ago.  My steak was dry.  Although cooked to perfection it was just dry.  I had to keep dipping it in the sauce to eat it.  Our server was also not on her game.  We had to flag down the bussers a couple of times and that is not cool in a restaurant of this caliber.    My daughter ordered the pork chops and said they were perfect.  She also had the Tiger Shrimp appetizer and loved it.     I've had better meals here before and better experiences.",

    "text": "My friend Jeff and I alternate taking each other to new restaurants. He often talked about Mesa being his favorite restaurant so when he offered to take my wife and I here for dinner I was really excited! I always watch Bobby Flay talk about balanced flavors on the food network and I was eager for an opportunity to taste food that met that description. If there was a word I could use to describe the experience, balance would be the word.  I started the evening with the barbecue duck and blue corn cake. The duck was sweat with a great depth of flavor that hits different parts of the palate. The duck was tender with and forward with a Smokey and sweet meat that finished with a mild heat. I didn't care for the blue corn cake. I thought it conflicted too much with the flavors developed in the duck and the sauce.   I also tried my friend's shrimp tamale. The tamale was terrific and the accompanying sauce was again phenomenal.  My wife had the 16 spice chicken which came with apricot butter mashed potatoes and a chili Mango salsa. The name of the game again is balance. The rub on the chicken supplied the spice with the sweetness from the mango salsa.  The best bite of the food was the pork loin. The pork was exceptional with what was an almost bbq like smoky sticky sauce and a beautiful orange spicy sauce that all tied together with the sweet rub on the pork loin. As much as I liked the pork loin, I didn't care for the sweet potato tamale. I think I took the sweetness over the top for the dish and I could have done with something a little brighter to add that next level of depth. I could eat that pork all day.  As for high end eating on the strip, this was reasonably priced with good service. The quality of food definitely meets the price point. I wouldn't be opposed to going again, but I felt like the dishes were consistently sweet. That I was waiting for relief from the sweetness, but it continued to find me. Each course on its own was delicious and balanced, but as a whole the sweetness was too much on some components.",

The service was excellent and the food recommendations were spot on.  We got the Shrimp Tamale Appetizer which was absolutely delicious.  The creamy sauce was ridiculous and we literally could have licked the plate.  Perfectly cooked shrimp, and lovely tamale had just enough sauce to dip in for each bite.  This dish is a \"must try!\"    Then as recommended we had the pork tenderloin and it was the best pork we have ever had!  Hands down!  The meat was so tender and was bathed in 2 gorgeous sauces.  There was some heat to the dish, but not overpowering.  The sweet potato tamale was a nice side to cut through the heat.  We also had the Brussels sprouts which were another great recommendation.  They had just the right crunch, and the sauce was heavenly.    We split our dishes and came out at around $75.  But for real, try this place!",

    "text": "I haven't been here in over 10 years, but I'm so glad to have a chance to come back and enjoy this food now that I'm a real foodie and restaurant goer. Unfortunately I was brought here on Valentine's Day which if you know anything about being a server, is the absolute worst day to eat out. It's all two tops and basically amateur hour for the patrons of the restaurant, which can make any good server lose patience quickly. I didn't have this experience, my server was excellent and extremely helpful to us. However it was extremely crowded for a Thursday night, and the two top tables are sat very close together so there was not a lot of privacy or table space.  I Brought my own wine, as I wanted to share some of my collection with my date. The corkage fee is $50 and there is a table limit of two bottles. Pretty standard for this caliber a restaurant.  The food was wonderful. I was able to try many different things, and enjoyed them all. Innovative ingredients, and high-quality execution. The kale salad was simply to die for, nice and light, citrusy and fresh. More like a slaw, So it match perfectly with our barbecue duck that came on top of a blue corn fritter. We then moved on to the chili crusted rabbit on top of couscous, which was just mouthwatering and wonderful. Also the fillet mignon and a side of mashed potatoes and a plantain tamale. The tamale was so good I can't even tell you. I would order a few sides of those just because!  For dessert, we got the chocolate sticky toffee pudding and a few dessert wines to accompany it.  The service was very attentive, kind and reflective of the price. The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was the more casual ambience and close fitting tables, which in my opinion does not match the quality or the price of the restaurant.",

Their rabbit entree intrigued me. Husband and I came in on a Sunday night at 5. We didn't have a reservation and we were sat immediately.   Our order was mostly apps with one entree that we split between us. We got:  Bread plate - Okay, this came with the meal, but there were definitely some intriguing breads. Although I try not to fill up on it.  Margarita - I'm not much of a margarita person, but husband said it was one of the best he had! Not too sweet and good flavor.  BBQ Duck - Very disappointing. I had high hopes and it was waaaaay to spicy for me to enjoy. If you're a spice wimp like me, I recommend getting this sauce on the side.  Black Kale Salad - I thought the kale would really be black, but it wasn't. It was just dark. This wasn't really as interesting as I would have hoped, and was really just an overpriced salad.  Mushroom quesadilla - I'm not a quesadilla fan, but this was pretty good! Very unique take and very creamy. Plus, I like the egg on top.   Rabbit - This wasn't bad at all but was sooo small for the price. I wish they would have given us just a little more. I feel like the entrees were more substantial.  A lot of the previous reviewers complained about the food being very salty and I have to agree. On some of the entrees it did feel excessive.  So overall I'm glad I went because I had been curious for a while, but I don't think I'd go back for food. I think if you a drinker, this place isn't too bad and their drink menu is worth a look.",

    "text": "Having heard great things about Mesa Grill for years, I was so excited to finally get to go for dinner this past trip to Vegas. We made our reservation on Open Table ahead of time to ensure not having a long wait as this place gets full quick.   Unfortunately the dishes I was hoping to try that evening were sold out including the baby romaine Caesar salad with chorizo, garlic croutons & Cotija cheese, as was the smoked chicken and black bean quesadilla with avocado and a toasted garlic creme fraiche.   I opted instead for Sophie's chopped salad and was pleasantly surprised by it. The menu doesn't say what comes in it, so I fully expected your typical chopped salad ingredients like bacon, chicken, hard boiled eggs, avocado, etc. What I got was a bed of romaine dressed in a zesty citrus vinaigrette and loaded with chickpeas, red beans, cucumber, tomato, cubes of Monterey Jack, and fried corn tortilla bits. Delicious!   Along with our bread basket which had Asiago jalapeno bread, cornbread muffins, and a walnut raisin bread, it was more than enough to fill me up for dinner. My husband ordered the mango spiced tuna steak and could not stop raving about how much he loved it.   He also got a side of the cilantro pesto mashed potatoes for us to share and wow. Even if you aren't a huge lover of cilantro I bet you would enjoy these. It's a very subtle flavor and honestly we could taste the butter and garlic more than the herbs.  I couldn't let us leave without trying a dessert however and since we couldn't decide between the banana cream pie with hazelnut praline or the churros, we got both! I assumed I would like the churros more because, fried things rolled in sugar, but we both proclaimed the banana creme the winner.  The churros were super dense and heavy in the middle. I guess I'm used to a lighter batter inside, and honestly neither dipping sauce did it for us. The star anise chocolate sauce was bitter & chalky, and I didn't enjoy the combo of coconut with dulce de leche.   That banana pie though! Perfectly caramelized and creamy, with the hazelnut praline giving you a much needed crunch in place of a pie crust. Utterly phenomenal; would 100% order that again.   I also recommend any of their famous margaritas. I had the white peach and it was perfectly tart and not overly sweet. We already can't wait to come back, but maybe for lunch next time before all the dishes I want sell out again ;-)",

    "text": "This place was delightful. Delightfully garbage. The generic \"we cater to high profile clientele\" faux atmosphere. Scripted, hollow husks for waitstaff. Children's portions of less than exciting food, all under the guise of being something fancy. I can't honestly say the food had any more charm or flavor than something obviously half-hearted and mass produced. Whilst dining, I had a moment of displacement, as I wasn't sure if I was in a Bobby Flay restaurant or a Del Taco. But let me tell you, the salmon drizzled in Del Taco hot sauce? Nailed it. Nice try, but you're not fooling anyone.   I'm currently enjoying cereal at home after this waste of time/money. And what's with the rule about headwear? Draconic. Get with the times. Your restaurant was *not* bougie enough for me to have to remove my hat.",

    "text": "Came to celebrate nothing. Just our love for food. My gf made a reservation from Open Table 3 days ago and we got seated right on time. 6:30pm on a Saturday night, no extra wait.   The waiter was very attentive and well trained. He asked if we had a show to catch and we did at 8pm at Bally's (across from Cesar's) and he made sure all our food came on time.   We started with some of the waiters recommendations (w.rec) and some because they plain looked delicious:   -Tiger Shrimp Tamale $19 (w.rec). You get ONE tamale that is light and fluffy, with plenty of freshly ground corn and 4 big shrimps. It was great and not filling (good or bad thing?). We finished this app and were then given the standard basket of bread. We thought they had forgotten the break but better late than never. The breads were soft and fresh. Extra points for that.  -Filet Mignon $52. This was the highlight of the night. Excellent, nicely charred outside but even though it looked burnt, it wasn't at all! juicy, delicious, definitely coated in wondrous Mexican spices (ancho chile sauce, mushrooms). A must get!  -Steamed Halibut $38 (w.rec). Lean large piece of clean protein. Definitely good for when you feel like eating light. I liked this a lot but the halibut might've been a minute overcooked.  Thankfully the sauce (guajillo chile posole broth) it rested on came to the rescue. I found this great although my gf thought it was dry.  -Side of Sweet Potato Gratin $12 (seasonal). Wow, this was really good. Beautiful layers of sweet potatoes topped with sticky sugars from broiling.  -Since we are huge fans of Gordon Ramsay's insane bread pudding, we gave this one a try: Chocolate Sticky Toffee Pudding $12. It was NOT good, overly sweet, strange chocolate and salty cajeta mix that i didn't find exciting or exotic. It was a miss.",

I've been to Mesa Grill many times and Everytime I go there I come out impressed by how great the food is. A must try dish is the Tiger shrimp tamale which is a signature of what Mesa Grill is all about. The combination of the sweet corn tamale with the delicious garlic sauce and perfectly cooked tiger shrimp will make you fall in love with this dish. So delicious!   This time around we ordered the sixteen spice chicken which I've always had my eye on to try out. It didn't disappoint at all! Perfectly cooked chicken that more tasted like a sweet and sour type sauce that tasted so good! Now the apricot mash potatoes was something I was very curious about. Thinking it was going to be a sweet tasting mash potatoes, but they are perfectly blended potatoes with a good helping of apricot butter that isn't that sweet at all. I could eat those everyday!  My friends also ordered the Filet with the twicw baked potato which I tried a few bites. The Filet was an absolutely perfectly cooked steak that was soft and juicy that you know it's a great cut of meat that you can cut with a spoon. The twice baked potato was awesome! It was a mash potato in a potato skins that has a sour cream horseradish that was over bearing on the horseradish taste. Really good!  Overall one if my top restaurants to eat at in Vegas and always delivers good food at a fair price in a really cool designed restaurant. Go here to eat!",

    "text": "It is so amazing to go to a restaurant and enjoy it completely!  I will have to be overly picky to give any negative feedback but overall this place is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to and will definitely return. Dinner on a weekend for a party of 2 review ahead, everything was shared.  1. Service is phenominal. Waiter (wish I remembered his name) was perfection in every way. Funny, easy going, honest, prompt. Food comes out so quick!  I was absolutely shocked.  2. Atmosphere is excellent. Not too fancy shmancy, but just enough to feel you're in a high class place enjoying quality food.  3. Food. Omg this will be long and I'll start from the very beginning. Bread service is quick and a basket of 3 different breads come. I wish the bread was warm, but it was still good. Not mind blowing good which isn't a terrible thing because I can get nearly full on yummy bread and ruin my meal. I had no intent to do that with this bread sinve it wasn't THAT good,  which is fine. Ordered BBQ duck for appetizer which truly should be made into an entree of its own. The flavor was bold and duck was cooked perfectly. My husband wiped the plate clean with bread at the end. I could have eaten it all for a meal and leave completely content. Washed the food down with some great Malbec, feeling like a queen. Then came the rib eye, a 22 ounce piece of heaven, sitting next to 2 sauces looking gorgeous. Sides of roasted corn and pesto cilantro mashed potato which must have had a kilo of butter was creamy and decadent. A teeny bit more salt to the potato would be stardom level, but I'm really being picky here. The steak was a gorgeous medium rare seasoned to perfection. A steak that represents Bobby, to me, in a way he deserves. Cut the steak for an absolutely consistent juicy reddish color and it just melted in my mouth. Melted and I really felt like a star getting some special meal made just for me. The corn had this awesome heat and paired perfectly with the steak. Another half bottle wine, waiter! No desert this time because we had enough and to ruin that taste with some of the options for dessert they had would be blasphemy.  3. Cost is what it should be. Not overpriced which a lot of these food star restaurants are. Not here. The hype is real, deserved, and price was appropriate (~$200/couple).  4. Location is great, in Caesars Palace, convenient.   Don't hesitate. This place is amazing from start to finish.",

After watching a ton of his shows, it's always been pretty obvious to me that he's a legitimate chef and not just some TV personality. I mean, he clowns amazing chefs on the regular, so I was expecting some big things at Mesa.  The breads served are pretty interesting; my favorite was probably the sweet raisin bread because simply it made raisin bread actually taste good.  I got the pan-roasted pork chops with yellow pepper mole sauce as recommended by my waiter, and it ended up being a solid choice. The color and presentation was beautiful, and the pork chops were perfectly cooked at medium; so soft! The pepper crust was sweet yet spicy--surprise, surprise, Bobby's M.O.--and the sauces didn't immediately jump out to me until I started to really dip the pork in them and let the flavor build with every bite.   I honestly did not think the sweet potato tamale was fabulously noteworthy; I guess it does its job as a second fiddle on the plate pretty well, but it doesn't stand out on its own.   Overall, Bobby didn't disappoint! Can't wait to come back and try other dishes.",

It was more like a yam casserole with a little heat to it. The dessert was the weakest to me. The texture of this cake wasn't what I was expecting. Thus the one star off. I saw the other desserts and my friends said the same thing. But I would try this place again. A very solid eating experience.",

They have 2 hours free but it ain't enough time if you're shopping and having a nice dinner. They should at least validate people if you spend a certain amount of money. Other than that, Mesa Grill is a must try if you're at Caesar's Palace.",

You'll be hard pressed to find a bottle under $50 though, so beware.  For appetizers, we tried the tuna nachos, which were REALLY GOOD, and the goat cheese \"queso fundido,\" which was EH. The queso didn't even taste like goat cheese and it was really oily and reminiscent of what happens when I microwave cheese at home with nachos.  For my entree, I went with their only vegetarian option--the chile relleno. It was good, but, at the end of the day, it was cornmeal-encrusted chile stuffed with cheese for $25. I guess what I'm saying is this place is really pricey for what you get.  The ambiance is nice, but the windows look right out into the sports book betting area, so it's not easy to forget you're in Vegas with a bunch of weirdos.",

Chef Bobby Flay is known for sassy and bold flavors, and Mesa Grill has never disappointed me.  My favorite entrees are spicy-rubbed pork tenderloin with mushroom couscous and wild rabbit with sweet potato stuffed corn tamale.  Both are perfectly cooked with just the right amount of spicy on the tenderloin, and wonderful flavors.  The jalapeno corn muffins are out of this world.  If any had been remaining, I'd have stuffed them into my purse.  The service is superb with good wine list.  Reservations are highly recommended for dinner.  Mesa Grill is the only reason that I visit Caesar's Palace except to gamble of course.",

The shrimp were very well seasoned, the tamale filling was slightly sweet and had corn for a nice texture contrast. As much as it pains me to give it a 5 star since Bobby Flay isn't my favorite person this restaurant definitely deserves it for the food, ambience and excellent service we got. Price point is expected for being a signature restaurant.",

It's perfect in size so you won't end up taking a nap after lunch. Cooked to a perfect temp. with melted cheese, green chiles, cilantro, and the best tasting red onions I have found on a burger today. While Caesars has since opened their new food court and managed to stuff a smash burger in there I still think it's worth the wait and not much more money to sit down and enjoy one of bobby flays burgers.",

Go here because the food is fantastic.  Right on the casino floor, Mesa Grill is right behind Ceasar's huge sports book area, adjacent from the popular Pure night club. Behind its huge glass windows you'll find amazing upscale southwestern food. Tons of flavor (lots of peppers, spices) and a very nice variety.   First off, dig into that bread basket as it has some killer cornbread in it.  Must-try items: goat cheese fundido -- c'mon. how are you not going to not love this? Pork Tenderloin -- amazing. CRAZY good shrimp and grits -- satisfying Tiger shrimp tamale -- tasty Blue corn pancakes -- delicious and fun Roasted corn -- it's a side dish, but really hits the spot.  I tried the dessert churro and didn't dig it, but otherwise, very good food!  One thing: Nothing here is mild. If you're on, say, a date, and want to avoid spicy, bold food, this may not be the best place for you.",

What I am trying to understand is how the casino cafes can get away with charging more than Bobby Flay for a burger that doesn't even come close to what you get at Mesa Grill.  If you look at the guides, Mesa Grill is listed as semi pricey - well in comparison to the mediocre food at many of the casino restaurants, this should be listed as inexpensive!  A burger costs $16 and it's worth every penny for the way the cheese is perfectly melted into the meat and the onions are caramelized to perfection.  Fries are seasoned really well too.    The barbecued lamb salad was delicious and not gamey.  They know how to make a pretty good Bloody Mary - but not as good as Old Ebbitt Grill in DC - Bobby ... go check it out and you'll see what I mean!   Service is always great.  Thanks for another delicious meal.",

If you just get a couple drinks (maybe not the peach margarita, which was my fault for ordering when everything else was too sweet), get the free bread & appetizers. I would go back for just that, but not for the \"real\" food... Sorry Bobby!",

The staff is always pleasant and knowledgable, food is served in a timely manner and the ambiance is fun and upbeat without being overwhelming.   I am not one to pick to eat goat cheese pretty much ever, but we went for the goat cheese queso and polished it off in record time. So so good. They also bring you a great assortment of bread that has chiles baked into it that's kind of perfect for dipping as well.   We made a reservation (I'd suggest doing that regardless of what night of the week it is) but arrived a bit early and grabbed a drink in the bar. Bartender was super friendly and attentive and was slammed so I was impressed. We were seated right on time and service was prompt from there on out.  This time I had the chile relleno which is always yummy and my friend got the pork tenderloin which I hadn't had before. She let me try a bite -- I could cut it with a butter knife and it pretty much melted in my mouth. So delicious.   This place will continue to be a staple for me in Vegas so I hope it doesn't go anywhere anytime soon! Definitely put this one on your list.",

Grilled salmon - great presentation and flavor with sauces on plate... I think it was a really good poblano sauce.  Excellent flavor and loved the tomatillo salsa on top of the fish.  Note to self (or whoever wants to listen): order fish well done.  I ordered mine medium this time and it was a little too underdone in the middle for my tastes.  Sophie's Chopped Salad - eh, I could take it or leave it.  Big chunks of cheese in the salad and the dressing was good but not OMG good.  Pork tenderloin sandwich - OMG good.  Spicy sauce with expertly seasoned and tender pork, great bread.  Roasted beet and grapefruit salad - EXCELLENT.    Service was great for us, but that is such a subjective thing because someone two tables over from us was hard-core bitching.  They had ordered appetizers, ate the appetizers, then put their order for lunch in and were whining because they saw that we had gotten our salads before their lunch order came out.  Wah, cry about it.  The manager came over and handled that little situation, but we were not disappointed with the service whatsoever.  Our server's name was Miguel, and he was really a very good server.  He made some great recommendations, which I always appreciate, and was, in general, pretty darn smooth.  For me, this is definitely a repeat.  I would love to do it again.",

I got the salmon with black bean sauce which was also great.  Very odd that the waiter asked how I wanted my salmon cooked - always a first time for everything!

My companions' entrees were in a similar vein - it was all just a little overdone. Next time, it'll be apps for sure - as well as seconds on the AMAZING blue corn muffins. Weirdly, Mesa Grill also had some of the best coffee I've had in a long time....or maybe it just tasted good for my post-New Year's hangover?",

Let me explain why, \"Oh yes Dad, I'll be checking in every day, right around dinner time! Would I like to meet you at Bobby Flays Mesa Grill, twist my arm\" Hello free meals in Vegas, I have to take what I can get!   Where do I start? Maybe Ill start by saying it was amazing! We were lucky enough to walk in without a reservation, only because it was 4pm. When we left around 7pm I am guessing we wouldn't have stood a chance coming in with out one at that time because the place was packed. We started with the southwestern and chopped salads. All three were so good, i kept wanting to eat my Dads and step Moms too. Our waiter must have though I lacked table manners because the whole time I was sticking my fork into my parents plates, but I couldn't help it! Everything was so good! The bread, oh the bread! So yummy! Everything here has this south western flare to it even the breads. One bread had jalapenos and cheese in it, a match made in heaven. There were little corn muffins too and assorted breads all fantastic as well. I ordered a fish dish and of course it was nothing short of spectacular. My favorite was the pork tenderloin and sweet potato tamales that that my step mom had ordered, they were to die for. The meat was falling off the bone!   This was possibly the best service ever, hands down! They wait on you hand and foot. It seemed like we had a server and about two bussers per table. Whenever we needed anything or even started to look like we might need something one of them was right there to take our order, order more drinks, or clear our plates. I'm definitely going back again even if my parents aren't there to pay for it this time.",

I know another reviewer (Chris O) had a terrible experience this week but for my fiance and I..it was wonderful.  The location is in Caesar's Palace.  The smart thing they did here was enclose the restaurant in glass so those noisey gambling machines do not interfere with your eating.  The wait staff are sharply  dressed in pin strip vests and gray shirts.  Our waiter and bus/getting-the-bread-to-the-table guy both were well informed about the specials.  The \"bread guy\" even explained the type of bread we were about to consume.  What other restaurant does that?!  My fiance ordered the Mesa burger and I ordered the chicken skewered tacos.  Both were absolutely delicious.  What I liked most of the tacos were their portion sizes.  Perfect for lunch so would not feel \"stuffed\".  I forgot to mention they had a peach martini.  Very tasty and cute.  My fiance said he wished we had taken pictures of our food prior to eating.  We shared plates and the burger was quite juicy and thick.  Be careful of the ketchep.  Bobby found a way to spice that up too!  The fries were phenomenal.  Sorry Chris O but I have to totally disagree with you here.  Mesa Grill is a place you should NOT avoid.  If you are in town for business and want a place to have a lunch meeting, Mesa Grill fits the bill.  Also a great place for couples.",

    "text": "This place was really good. I read mixed reviews and was nervous to give it a shot. I came for appetizers and liked it so much we came back for dinner the next night. The restaurant is very colorful, in my opinion a little bit cheesy, but appropriate for Southwestern restaurant. The food was great! We had:  Sophie's Chopped Salad - amazing! very simple but bursting with flavor and crunch. I ordered it on both visits.  Tiger Shrimp and Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale- Excellent! Came with jumbo size prawns and a heavenly corn sauce. Each bite was heaven! Spicy Tuna and Salmon Tartares - This was good, but it was exactly what you would expect of a tartar. It wasn't bad by any means, but many of the other dishes overshined this standard plate. Grilled Lamb Poerterhouse- Tasty and huge but I like my lamb a little more muted in flavor. My hubby loved it though. Blue Corn Crusted Halibut - this was my entree. It was delicious!!! The corn crust added a new texture to the juicy tender halibut. The tomoatoe oragano gave a great kick with it's spiciness. Halibut needs big flavors and this dish definatley reflected that.  New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin- Really flavor full and not dry at all. Chorizo-Goat Cheese Tamale - I wanted this to be good, but it was very bland skip. This worked better in theory.   All in all we had a wonderful time at Bobby Flay's restaurant. The service was excellent, the flavors did not disappoint. While this was a spendy restaurant there are much more expensive restaurants on the strip. I would go back.",

I tried the steak that my friend ordered and it was really really good.  I'm not a big steak person, but it definitely blew me away.

    "text": "Went with 3 friends and shared a taste of 4 different dishes and several appetizers. We were all wowed by the experience. The appetizers were the real highlight: the shrimp tamale, chicken quesidilla, and chicken taco, and blue corn pancake were all one of a kind taste experiences with so many amazing flavors. The bread basket was also great with three unique flavorful varities. On to the entrees the Chile Relleno was admittedly forgettable. The New York Strip Steak was excellent quality but not uniquely flavored more than other excellent steaks at Morton's, etc so if you are going for the unique experience you should not just get the steak, though perhaps you can split it like we did. The Grouper and Cioppino were both excellent and the sauce in the latter was so good we were all dipping our bread in it at the end of the meal. I tried the Mashed Potatoes with white queso sauce and they were good too, but you can only do so much with mashed potatoes and the appetizers were better I think. We had a great dining experience here and so can you, just be sure to try a few different appetizers, share your entrees to get all the flavors, and trust the chefs with all the intriguing combinations offered on the menu. The margaritas and the service are great too and it was well worth the experience to go. I can't wait to go again and try more of the items on the menu, as everything was a new experience.",

If you like grits the blue corn grits is to die for. We had the halibut - great; the wild and farm raised salmon - just as great; 16 spiceed chicken - great; and a fall back of steak with green and red pepper sauce - great; and the pork tenderloin - also great. The red and green southwest peppers sauces were fantastic. Las Vegas can buy anything and they spent their money wisely to bring Bobby Flay to Caesers.",

    "text": "I have got to say Mesa and Flay did not disappoint! I am not a huge Bobby Flay fan, don't really watch any of his shows on Food Network, but the man can deliver on flavor! I had very high expectations going into this meal (based on Yelp reviews) and they were all met! Me and Ms. Mega went to Vegas in August for our Anniversary and MESA was our anniversary dinner.   Reservations were for 7:30pm for Monday and the place was full, always a good sign I guess! We were sat at a table close to the open part of the kitchen so I was able to see all the different dishes coming out. They bought us a basket of bread, and they were quite good, I enjoyed the jalapeno muffin the best. I ordered a Pear Margarita and it was strong! It tasted good but just a bit too strong for me, at least you can't say they're stingy with the tequila!   I had the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin and Ms. Mega had the Southwestern Spiced Duck Breast. I have to say this is the BEST Pork Tenderloin I have E V E R had! The first bite was just amazing, the spices were just right, it wasn't too hot but at the same time you knew it was there. The pork was so tender and moist, it was cooked perfectly. The flavors combined for a PARTY in my mouth, usually I inhale my food but this meal I really took my time to enjoy the spices. Even my GF enjoyed the pork and she is not the biggest fan of the pork. My GF enjoyed her duck, I had a piece and thought it was ok but I think I was a bit biased because of how good my pork tenderloin was. By the time I was down to my last piece of pork, I was cutting my bites smaller and smaller, trying to savor the last of this heavenly pork.   We were full but I really wanted to try the Toasted Coconut Layered Cake, and it was good! The slice we got was pretty big, and was very very rich and delicious. We tried to finish it but we tapped out with 3-4 bites left.   The service was very good, our waiter was very good, not overbearing and our water glasses were continually filled.   Overall this was an awesome tasty experience, the total bill was about $130 with tip and I felt it was worth every penny. I will definitely eat here again when I come back to Vegas next year!",

    "text": "Ah, five-star service, literally impeccable from the time you enter the restaurant until you leave, but the food is truly disappointing for the price, three stars at best.  I will give them five stars for the cocktails as well.  The food is the problem.  Four of us sat down for dinner.  My wife and I shared the \"porterhouse\" lamb chops, which came with a tamale.  We also ordered a chile relleno side.  The lamb chops were excellent, though a tad overcooked.  We had ordered medium-rare and were told that the chops would be red to red-purple inside.  They arrived a strong pink inside.    The tamale was absolutely awful, stuffed with what seemed like Jack in the Box taco filling.  No one at the table cared for the tamale.  My wife and I tried the chile relleno.  I don't know what Bobby Flay knows about Southwestern or Mexican food, but the relleno arrived coated in an extra crunchy cornmeal batter.  The filling, which is why the chile is called a relleno, was undiscernable.  One companion ordered the filet mignon and ordered it medium.  It arrived medium-rare.  Maybe the cooks had mixed up the lamb chops with the filet order.  At any rate, the filet was returned to the kitchen for additional cooking.  The filet was outstanding, rubbed with a chipotle mixture, which gave the meat a smoky, spicy kick.  The final person of our foursome ordered a New York steak.  He was disappointed.  The only seasoning he could taste was salt, which he said was a little too heavily applied.  The meat was good, but that's what it was: heavily salted meat.  They shared herbed mashed potatoes, which we all tasted.  They were good, but nothing that would merit a better review.  All in all, the meal was good, but, I believe, for the money I would go someplace else.",

The main courses range in price from $40-55 or so and for two people to eat (with an appetizer and a few drinks) and the bill can get in the $175 or more range.  Instead of ordering two meals, we ordered 5 appetizers which were reasonably priced and more than enough food for the two of us.  It was a fantastic meal and we got to try a number of dishes without breaking the bank.  Sure, we probably missed out on an incredibly steak but we left happy.  Only reason for not giving 5 stars was the ambience.  The restaurant has all windows around the exterior and is right next to the sports book.  It was very distracting with 4 giant screens of horse racing behind my wife while we were talking.",

    "text": "First time experience at the Mesa Grill in Caesar's Palace. Decided to try lunch on a Wednesday and thought that it might be a good idea to go in on Tuesday and make a reservation. But once we found out that we would be charged $50 per person if our group of four cancelled after 9:00 a.m. on Wednesday monring we decided to just take our chances and show up as walk ins. ( I mean really, it's Vegas! I won't even be awake until noon so how could I call and cancel before 9:00 a.m.?) Don't know if that would work on a weekend, but we did fine walking in at 1:30 on a Wednesday.  First, the service: wonderful! Attentive without being obtrusive. Friendly without being overly chummy. Obviously a restaurant that puts some time and energy into training the wait staff, which I appreciate.   Next, the food: also wonderful! I had the fixed price lunch menu for $29. You get a choice of one of two appetizers, one of two entrees and the chef's special dessert. Price-wise it's like getting dessert for free. For the appetizer I had the Blue Corn Grilled Duck Pancake which was like a soft taco with shredded duck in the most delicious barbecue sauce I have ever tasted. Buffalo burger for the entree - quite good though a little dry. That's the buffalo meat tho' which is very lean. The dessert was warm chocolate cake which was excellent - not overly sweet, just the taste of good chocolate. And they had great coffee!  My husband had the pork tenderloin sandwich, which he expected to be hot but was served cold. Very tasty though. Two young adults with us had the coffee-rub steak sandwich which was very good - tender meat that was easy to eat sandwhich style and french fries with a slightly spicy seasoning.  The menu has so many interesting sounding dishes that we will certainly be back to try more. I thought the prices were fair for Las Vegas, particularly on the lunch menu - things are a little pricier at dinner. Except for the idea of charging people $50 each for missing a reservation, I thought this was a great restaurant.",

    "text": "I loved this place! And I am saying this without considering my love for Bobby Flay.  I really liked the decor of the whole place. Little flames on the ceiling and BBQ pit looking things all around you made me feel comfortable yet classy.  I always like to check out the bathroom of any place, because I feel like the bathroom has it's own little niche in decoration process of a restaurant. Flay did not dissappoint. I mean the paper towles themselves must have cost a fortune!  I ordered the salmon (delish!) with the corn (also delish). The salmon came out perfectly! I loved how I could take each layer as a bite and really enjoy the flavor.  The boyfriend has halibut with mashed potatoes. I don't know what Flay did to those mashed potatoes, but I never had better ones. They were so creamy and delicious that I would probably just go there for those again.  We also had wine, and although I do not remember the exact name, I can tell you that it went very well with both of our fish.",

We also ordered a side of mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach.  I can't say it was anything special and I've definitely had better on all fronts.  My main issue is that I'm a big fan of lamb but the citrus sauce that they used pretty much killed all the gamey flavor.  I guess that's fine for people who don't want a gamey taste but then they probably shouldn't be ordering lamb anyways.  For the price, I would definitely recommend going elsewhere.",

Server took 7 minutes to get to our table and when he did never introduced himself or gave us his name, just jumped straight in to \"What can I get ya?\" All horrible by any restaurant standards. He seemed either overwhelmed, poorly trained or distracted. I'm a service freak so it usually sets me on edge when someone can't concentrate on the most important function of their role.  Then we received our meals and all was well with the world. I had the lamb with Serrano chile sauce that was so good I wanted to throw my plate across the room! All meals excellent. Server inattentive and never swung by the table to check on us. We had to flag someone else down for drinks and refills.   Then, in keeping with the evening, the server, though our plates were cleared, didn't come back to the table for a very long time. We again flagged someone down to find him so we could get our check and leave. At that point we were frustrated and skipped dessert.   I have the utmost respect for Mr. Flay. The food was fantastic. The service unfortunately lived far below the reputation his name should engender. I'll consider it an anomaly and hopefully the server has moved on and is working somewhere else. Food 5 stars, service 1 star. 4 stars out of respect for Bobby Flay. We'll try it again and hope to have good service.",

Finally, we get a celebrity chef who can cook a great burger the way you specify it.  Most chefs reheat a Sysco burger two rareness levels below your criteria.  I like my burgers very well done, and it came out that way.   They didn't have full-bore Budweiser or regular Miller beer, or even XX in the green bottle; so I chanced it on some shit European beer which tasted like shit - and bitter shit at that.  Rather than suffer through it, I drank a little, cut my losses, then ordered a Miller light which was near perfect.  All these specialty beers from Europe are shit; they exist for frauds who need to position themselves as avant-garde connoisseurs of beer.  They are fooling no one.  The world laughs at them.  Service was excellent.  I left a slightly higher than 20% tip.  Like MacArthur, I shall return.",

We decided we wanted something formal but comfortable and last minute changed our reservations and came here instead!  Cocktails: I had the traditional Mesa margarita on the rocks, it was a bit tart but very well made and delicious. My husband decided to get the mint julep. Strong but a gem!   Appetizers: Goat Cheese Queso! You die and go to cheese, poblano heaven.   Bread basket: even the bread basket was outstanding. Southwestern flavors at their best, showcased in the best form possible, bread.   Entree 1: the New York strip steak, medium rare. One of the best seasoned, flavorful cuts of meat I've had.   Entree 2: my husband had the 16 spice chicken, I couldn't believe how Bobby accomplished to incorporate 16 spices yet have them develop in a lovely way without being overbearing. This came with our favorite, the cilantro pesto mashed potatoes.   Sides: my steak did not have a side, this is where the cilantro pesto mashed potatoes complimented it very well.   The roasted corn: I didn't realize this was seasonal, but every time I have this I'm actually upset that I don't have 3 stomachs to be able to finish and eat way too much of it.  Server: she was so sweet and made our dinner a lovely experience  Bottom line, I love this restaurant way too much. It is consistent and well priced, relaxed but still formal. Perfect dinner experience.",

I'm chipping off one star because $30 is pretty steep for half a chicken and some mashed potatoes, but food is always pricey in Vegas.  I've eaten at a lot of terrible places in Las Vegas.

    "text": "Ugh. So disappointing. So so disappointing. I love Bobby Flay so I was really excited to go to his restaurant while in Las Vegas. My Husband and I didn't get a chance to go last time we were in town, so I cancelled a reservation I had at another restaurant (big mistake) to go here.  The night started off well with nice and professional hostesses and the decor is really cool and interesting but that's about where the good ended. Our server Sheldon was absolutely horrible. A server can easily make or break a meal, and Sheldon really hit the nail in the coffin for us. We didn't see him for the first 10 minutes or so after sitting down, and then he came over to take our order. No introduction, small talk or overview of the menu or specials. Nothing. We then didn't see him until he was ready to give us the check. I say when he was ready to give us the check because it took about 10 minutes for that to come after we were done eating. He never even checked on us during our meal. Not once. No smiles or friendliness or anything. So disappointing to spend good money on a meal and get Taco Bell service.  I'm a Vegetarian so I ordered the one Vegetarian entree on the menu; the Chili Rellano. It was pretty bad. It was colorful, but very very bland. I could tell Bobby Flay www trying to be creative with the different sauces, but nothing worked together. Everything was very weird and I suffered through a few bites. Yuck.  My Husband had their Sweet Potato Clam Chowder which he thought was OK, and the Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin which he suffered getting through as well. The pork was tough and not a good cut, and the tamale that came with it he couldn't even eat. We also ordered the Cilantro Pesto Mashed Potatoes which were just that, mashed potatoes with some pesto. Lame.  We will never come back. The entire meal was so disappointing. I want my $100 and hour of my life back. The only reason I gave it two stars is it didn't make us sick.",

    "text": "Heard about this place from a friend and thought it would be extremely expensive since we're talking about a restaurant owned by a world renowned chef (Bobby Flay) in Vegas. So I checked out the menu online and to my surprise, the prices were totally reasonable. Far less than I expected. Entrees ranged anywhere from mid $30's to mid $50's. I'm in.  I ordered a skinny marg, shrimp tamale appetizer, and lamb porterhouse. But tried each of my friend's dishes too cause they looked goooood. My thoughts on everything:  BREAD: 4/5. The jalapeno bread is BOMB. The other two breads were decent. MARGARITAS: 5/5. Tried 4 different types and they were all top notch. SHRIMP TAMALE: Easily the best tamale I've ever had. This item was expensive ($19 I think) but worth the try imo. LAMB PORTERHOUSE: 5/5. One of the best lamb dishes I've ever had. The filet side was melt in your mouth good. PORK TENDERLOIN: 5/5. Best pork tenderloin I've ever had. NEW YORK STEAK: Cooked to perfection. Nice medium rare with a slight char on the outside. Sauce was bomb.  Service was great as well.  Mesa Grill is perfect if you want some high quality food but aren't in the mood for a super fancy or expensive dining experience. I will be back for sure.",

    "text": "It has lost its Michelin Star rating. But.. I may be the last person on earth who's not eaten at a Bobby Flay's joint. I'm ambivalent about celebrity chefs as a whole but some are really good: Thomas Keller and Marcus Samuelsson come to mind.  Food is surprisingly good. Blue corn pancake and shrimp to start. Rabbit on green pea cous cous blew my mind. It was really phenomenal. Rib eye was super yummy. Fish was decent.  It's a lot less expensive than Masa or Robuchon.  It's got great service. The spiciness was just right, subtle but carries punch.   This is what I think about celebrity chef restaurants. Some can be very good (Red Rooster in Harlem), and some can be impressively bad (Paula Deen's the Lady and Sons in Savannah), but most of them are going to be somewhere in between.   What's unusual about Mesa grill is that it's quite a different type of southwestern restaurant. The side corn reminded me of Mac and Cheese. Bobby Flay took something ordinary and made them into extraordinary. Few people can get rabbit right. He did. This restaurant did.  Seeking a mid price range restaurant in the casino that guarantees a full basket of carbs shortly after you order, and serves up 22 oz rib eye to curb your steak craving? Seek no longer.",

An almost baseball-like hand shaped charcoal grilled patty, sits under two melted cheeses, grill-smothered white onion tomato and leaf lettuce on--surprisingly--an untoasted, fairly bland bun. Clearly the flavors within (and everything augments the juicy, smoky burger, nothing overwhelms) don't need any help.   I recommend you request the crispy, slightly spicy \"Adobo fries\" which normally come with the (sloppy, confusing) Media Noche burger, instead of the \"Southwest fries\" which usually come with the regular burger.",

The spicy chicken was average but was cooked well.  The blue corn pancake with barbecue duck was so  drowned in barbecue sauce I could not taste anything or enjoy the duck.  Also the pancake was paper thin and technically a crepe.  The sides were small, and the mashed potatoes were.....well, just plain mashed potatoes - nothing special.  The service was average.  The restaurant is right off the casino so be prepared to smell plenty of cigarette smoke as you try to enjoy your meal.   And, the tables are way too close for any sense of intimacy - be prepared to hear every word the adjacent table discusses and be prepared for them to hear your conversation as well.  Lastly, the desserts were great - otherwise this would have been a one star review.  Kudos to the pastry chef.  For the restaurant as a whole though: Celebrity Chef - no so celebrity restaurant.",

There was about an hour and a half wait for a table so we decided to sit at the bar.  I actually love dining at the bar...  Service is always great and bartenders usually make for good convo...  We had the apple salad to start. OMG!  I've never had anything like this before. Spicy but sweet...  And the cheese in it was to die for!  The portion size was good. I made a comment that I could probably eat the whole thing by myself and be full!  Oh the bread!  How could I forget!?!?!  The jalapeno bread and the muffin were so good!  I ate the whole muffin myself.  I ordered the pork tenderloin.  *DROOL*. It's rubbed with spices and has a sweet BBQ like sauce with some hot sauce drizzled on top...  The cornbread tamale complimented it perfectly. The portion size was HUGE!  Two people could have shared the plate and have been full... maybe room for a bite of dessert.  We also ordered the chicken which was so so so moist and cooked perfectly. It came with chive mashed potatoes which were light and flavorful...  I really enjoyed dinner. I had flavors which I've never had before and was pleasantly surprised!",

You can't go wrong with the deep dish banana creme pie.  I'd probably go again to try another dish based on the fact my date's lamb dinner was quite good from the sample she let me have.

    "text": "I'm doing the unthinkable.  I'm giving Bobby Flay five stars.  I didn't want to like Mesa Grill. I saw it on the Las Vegas Michelin guide and told the boy, \"I can't believe they gave Bobby Flay of the Food Network a star. How can simple Southwestern food compare to the complexity of French food?\"  Well, I was wrong.  Mesa Grill is many things, but simple is not one of them.  Starting with the bread basket, you could tell this was going to be something interesting. Amidst the bread lay a yellow and blue corn cornbread muffin, filled with little pieces of corn and peppers. The boy had problems buttering his cornbread so he didn't enjoy it as much, but I really liked it. Even the white bread had bits of jalapenos in it, adding a definite kick to the start of your meal.  Next, the appetizers. We ordered the blue corn pancake with barbecued duck (sort of like a BBQ peking duck) and a goat cheese chorizo tamale. Neither did it for me, but who cares about the appetizers? I was too distracted by their margaritas.  Here's a word of wisdom to everyone who is thinking about coming to Mesa Grill: ORDER A MESA GRILL MARGARITA.  After trying a Mesa Grill margarita, I'm not quite sure if I can drink anything else. Their margaritas are what a margarita should taste like - top shelf tequila (it was smoother than some vodka I drink!), fresh lime juice, quality salt...it was totally light, totally refreshing...If only they made yard long drinks of THAT.  Anyway, back to the meal - the boy ordered the dry rubbed pork tenderloin while I had the pan seared halibut. The boy's pork tenderloin was tender. Actually, tender doesn't even begin to describe it - every time I took a bite, it had the texture of filet mignon. Just the way they prepared it was mindblowing. My halibut was flakey and moist, but if I could have done it all over again, I would have ordered the tenderloin too.  The thing I think I love the most about Mesa Grill is that the whole experience is unlike anything else I've tried. You can't compare the flavors to anything else - everything we tasted was in your face, upfront and bold...  ....Almost like Bobby Flay's personality.  Wow. I've been converted.",

My husband and I, my niece, brother and sister-in-law were vacationing in Las Vegas when we decided to meet up with my stepmom and stepbrother there to have dinner at the famous Mesa Grill. Too bad we had eaten at Studio B in the M Resort just a few hours earlier so I wasn't really that hungry. But I had a bunch of appetizers, and shared a salmon dish with my sister-in-law. It was so good that it melted in my mouth! The salad I ordered was pretty good too! The ambiance is nice and the food on the pricey side. Good thing my stepbrother paid for everything! Thanks so much for that Randy! It missed the five star rating because we had to walk a long way to get there because it is inside Caesar's Palace, and because there was one dish I tried that was more of a 'miss' versus a 'hit'. But I would definitely come back one day to try more entrees.",

Fresh, crispy tasting, and served with two really awesome sauces splayed beautifully across the plate.  Big winner appetizer here.  Rough Cut Tuna \"Nachos\" - Can probably pass on this one.  Chunks of moderately bland/unseasoned raw tuna are served with about 20 absurdly tiny \"nacho\" dipping tortilla chips (think mini tostitos bite size rounds, with half of them blue corn and half regular)  Sixteen Spice Crusted Chicken - This was pretty delicious.  Tender, juicy, spices crisped on the skin... it was a very nice piece of poultry.  The buttermilk mashed potatoes were also killer.  Mango + Spice Crusted Tuna Steak - Yes its True they like mango and spices here.  This was by far the most delicious thing on the table.  The tuna was just overflowing with an awesome spice crusted exterior.  It was perfectly seared.  As you bite into it, you get that fantastic full tuna taste and texture at first.  Then the spices kick in a little more slowly, intensifying in flavor throughout the bite, with a real nice spicy punch in there at some point as well.  Wow this was an awesome piece of tuna.  Somehow we got out of here for under $100 a person despite ordering entrees, appetizers, cocktails and wine.  Good times!",

The fries were very good. My partner got the Southwestern Spice Chicken Skewers. There were 3 skewers per order. The first 2 skewers were fine, the third was raw just under the surface. When we told the waiter he at first said \" We use pink salt so that is probably what this is\", this chicken was RAW! Once the chef saw the chicken, the manager came to the table and apologized profusely and offered to fire another order which we declined, they did insist on comping the chicken. One of the things I really wanted to do in Vegas was to eat at Mesa because I have made many of Bobby's recipes in the past and love his flavors. I have to say I wasn't wowed and I was very surprised at the chicken. I am definitely going to Bar American in NYC to see if the quality is better. I sure hope so.",

Then she said \"first come first serve.\"  She didn't bother to offer that when asking about availabilities.  I'm not sure of her name but she has black hair and wears glasses with plastic frames.    We sat down in the bar area.   It was a couch with two small tables.  Our waitress was very nice and helpful in ordering food.  The food:  Bread Basket:  -the best bread basket I have ever received at any restaurant.  It comes with corn bread, raison bread, bread sticks, and a corn scone(?)  They were all delish!  Blue corn pancake: - It was really good! The pancake complimented the spiciness and flavors of the duck.  It was very different than anything I've ever eaten.  Spice rubbed pork tenderloin - good portions.  They give you three pork tenderloin.  The best part was the sweet potato tenderloin.  Cioppino - It was good, but not extra ordinary.  Crushed Blueberry Cream Tart: Very tasty!!!!  Recommendations: blue corn pancake appetizer, pork tenderloin and any dessert! (they all look so good)",

Bobby Flay saved himself with his grilling skills. The steak was seasoned with a southwest spice flavor to it. It literally leaves spicey-ness into your mouth. Maybe that's why our waiter (Richard) waited (I actually had to reminde him twice) for my house margarita...which I had to pay for.

We stopped in last Saturday for their brunch menu and I all of us were astonished at how lacking the service was.   But let me talk about the good eats first... Two of us ordered the Mesa Burger, which was excellent. One medium/one medium rare, both of which were grilled spot on. Two of us ordered the Chicken Hash, which was another good choice and an interesting combination of flavors.  The grits that were served with it were some of the best I've ever had. Our burgers were served with fries, which while weren't bad, paled in comparison to the duck fat fries we had the night before at StripSteak.  The extras: They provide a complimentary assorted breads basket, which is well down and was scarfed down by us quickly.  Three of us tried different margaritas, which were excellent.   Why service was terrible...very slow, we had to wave down servers on more than one occasion (if we were taken care of, why would we ever have to do this?!), one person, who had just ordered a diet Pepsi, was out of drink for a while until we had to flag someone down for a refill. At $4 a soda we expect a refill.  Our server actually started talking once before ever getting to our table (couldn't hear him) and started walking away while I was talking to him. Kinda rude buddy. Especially if you're serving at a restaurant of this caliber.   The total, for the four of us, excluding tip was $122.15",

    "text": "Bobby Fley, I've don't know if it's because of the crowd I run with, but each and everyone of my foodie friends all tell me the same thing when they describe to me their dinning experience at your restaurant.  They all usually start by saying something to the effect of, \"I don't care for Bobby Fley's TV shows\" or \"I'm not the biggest Fley fan..\" and then is always followed up by the same but: : \"...The meal was amazing\" or \"...You have to try it when your in Vegas\"  And if you are constantly bombarded by hearing statements like these over and over again, it's hard to avoid coming in with your expectations raised.    For those looking for the cliff notes version:  It didn't disappoint.  Here is the long version:  First things should note is that the service here was simply exemplary, our server (Brian) was attentive and but was able to keep it from feeling stuffy and overbearing, and considering we were in the middle of dinner service and the place was buzzing with energy, for some reason things didn't feel quite that way with him taking care of us.  Talking to him about the dishes, his personal recommendations and even his check ups on us came regularly but he managed to not disrupt the mood of our dinner conversations.  Busers, were circulating constantly and kept refilling my water (I drink alot of it) without the need for me to keep asking and they kept the bread coming.  Oh man, the yellow/blue cornbread with bits of pepper in it with the creamy honey butter was so damn tasty...  They kept that coming too, but it took my g/f and a knife to keep my advances on the bread bowl at bay since we had a ton more food coming...   Starter - Blue corn pancake with Barbecued Duck and a Habanero Chile-Star Anise Sauce:  Such a mixture of complex bold flavors, really bold.  The duck was moist, richly seasoned, the sauces hit every single taste bud:  heat, smokiness, the anise provided a very deep level of different flavors, the blue pancake was super thin, light and fluffy and in texture reminded me of a Chinese pancake/roast duck dish I was familiar with, but the similarities ended there, the flavors totally scream to me what Flay is all about.  Superb.  New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin in a Bourbon-Ancho Chile Sauce and a Sweet Potato Tamale + Crushed Pecan Butter  My g/f ordered this dish, so I got to pick at it a bit, from the bites that I got in I have to say the meat was superb, well seasoned, nice char on the outside and the meat was perfectly cooked.  The sweet potato tamale with pecan butter was rich and sweet and was a nice change of pace with the rest of the dish.  Chipotle glazed in bone rib eye with a currant chile reduction sauce and a Pumpkin tamale + thyme butter  The two little rib eye pieces were also perfectly cooked, the sauce had a very subtle sweetness to it with a touch of heat.  The meat had a nice smokiness to it, and there was a nice char to the meat on the outside with a bloody awesome in the middle.  The pumpkin tamale provided a sweetness to the dish, personally I liked the sweet potato tamale more.  A side of a Chile relleno  A stuffed chile deep fried, anything tastes better when it's stuffed and deep fried.  Tres Leches Flan  Rich creamy texture, the caramel sauce and the light crisp cookie on top was just....  (I'm running out of words and synonyms to describe something as good)...  Each bite was absolutely intoxicating.  Each bite had a little bit of caramelized sauce, creamy vanilla infused flan and cookie crisp.  So to sum up, fantastic food, great drinks and amazing service.  The evening was perfect and more importantly it lived up to and surpassed my expectations, and considering Vegas is home to a number fantastic restaurant, Mesa grill is definitely a worth-while stop.  I'm pretty sure I will be making a stop off in New York sometime soon and check out Fley's other restaurant.  Because hell, Ill say it, I like Bobby Fley!!!",

    "text": "On a recent visit to Las Vegas the Mesa Grill was selected to check out. We were familiar with the Chef/Owner Bobby Flay from television and the fact we were staying at Caesar's Palace were contributing factors. The reviews on YELP made the decision a little easier.   We arrived a little early and our table was being prepared. We sat in a waiting area and were immediately approached by a young lady to see if we would desire a drink. Of course we did and just as she delivered the libations the table was ready. We had a strategically place two top in a corner that would have been my choice if given the opportunity.   Our waiter was Arnel and the sommelier was Bernardo. Both made our multi hour meal one of the best. We found wines at a wide range of prices but we decided on a somewhat reasonable priced Stags Merlot. The service and attention was as good as it gets and without interfering with dinner and conversation. Arnel will be requested on any future visit to Las Vegas.   Our plan was for a long culinary experience tasting and sharing as much as was reasonable. What is also helpful is the servings are not large. The Tuna Nachos and the Shrimp Tamale were very scrumptious and flavorful. The hotness was just right for New Orleans' type of diners.  Permit me to mention that we noticed as soon as we sat down and entered into a conversation about the food and its' preparation with Arnel that there were no salt and pepper shakers on the table. We were hoping that meant we would be served food seasoned properly and we were.   For what I will term our entrees for the evening were the Scallops and the Pork Tenderloin. Scallops have to be cooked perfectly and they were. The Pork Tenderloin was just too good. Our taste buds were in ecstasy. To find a Five Star restaurant in Las Vegas and one in a casino even if it is Caesar's took us back a little.   One side dish has to be mention and that was the Mashed Potatoes. My wife made comment that she will not be able to eat any of the potatoes without additional seasoning. After tasting a fork full I informed her that would not be necessary. She tasted and agreed. Some of the best mashed potatoes I have consumed in a restaurant were at the Mesa Grill.   We ended with decadent Banana Pie and illy coffee that made us so pleased that we did not have far to go to return to our room.  The Mesa Grill has My Seal of Approval.",

    "text": "Oh my god.  Are you serious?  This is a restaurant?  I got so sick here, I felt like I was on my death bed.  Let me detail what happened here.  Firstly, try and call to get through to them, to make a reservation.  Good luck!  I think, out of a total of ten times calling them, I was lucky to get through once.  AND, THEN, these high faleuentant assholes want to hold a credit card for the reservation.  If you don't show, that's right!  $50 a pop!  Lord only knows how much money they would hold in the account area, before it clears.  Their dry ass corn bread biscuits fall apart in your hand, from their overdone bread presentation.  Why in the hell is raisin bread served at a tex/mex style place?  And, it wasn't that good anyway.  From their limited menu (What?  Does Bobby Flay have a limited imagination?), we weren't all that hungry, so my other half - Ralph - and I decided to order the lamb.  It came as two chops.  He likes his done one way, and me another.   Now, the waitress was very nice, and tried to accommodate us.  So, she asked the chef.  That stupid idiot refused to cook what his PAYING CUSTOMERS wanted.  ARE YOU SERIOUS??!!  I have NEVER, EVER gotten that from ANY restaurant!  iN THIS ECONOMY??!!!  The issue was with one chop being cooked well done.  She had both of them done medium well, and then sent the other back to be done to my liking.  The potatoes were goopy, and tasted like they were made from a mix worse than Jiffy.  My prickly pear virgin drink tasted like the sourest of lemons.  Why did I have to add four packs of raw sugar?  The collard greens were overly spicy, as this isn't the traditional recipe.  Actually, nothing about this restaurant is traditional.  Had it had an ounce of French tradition, it would have been far better.  That same night, I came down with food poisoning, and was sick for the next two days.  We immediately called the restaurant, and complained.  Now, any other establishment worth it's salt wouldn't have blinked twice, and would've given our money back immediately.  Did idiot Flay?  NO!  We got referred to their chicken shit security team, who has to take a report, and him haw for over a week (while I am dying).  WE STILL DON'T HAVE A RESOLUTION FROM THEM!  DON'T EAT HERE!",

Less than awesome menu items: -the ribs (eh...wouldn't order again. Ate the other half of my hubby's burger instead of finishing my ribs lol) -Chicken skewers (standard chicken skewers, nothing I couldn't get anywhere else)  Also, I've never had a bad dessert here.

    "text": "I have heard many good reviews about Mesa Grill. I made a reservation a month ahead. The interesting part is that Mesa Grill required the customers to provide their credit card numbers. If the customers didn't show up on their reservations, they would charge the credit cards $50. That is interesting, but I don't mind it. I think if people really want to go, they would be willing to go through the trouble.  I love the ceiling with the flaming painting. Nothing would match better with Bobby Flay's cooking style, chili peppers and spices. Before going to Mesa Grill, I was very worried that I couldn't get anything to eat, because I don't eat spicy food at all. When we got there, I talked to the server. He said that most of Bobby's food is not that spicy, and the chili add flavors. He gave a couple of suggestions, and I went with the WILD STRIPED BASS. My husband got the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin. And, we shared BLUE CORN PANCAKE for appetizer.  The BLUE CORN PANCAKE is served with shredded pieces of duck. The first bite definitely reminded me of the Chinese Peking duck. The duck was good and juicy. Even though there was Habanero (one of the most intense chili pepper in the world), it wasn't spicy at all. It was very flavorful. My husband loved it! His pork tenderloin was placed nicely on the plate. The rubbed was definitely spicy. Bryan said it was a bit spicy for him, but it was edible. The side SWEET POTATO TAMALE was sweet and delicious. It was a perfect balance with the spicy pork. My WILD STRIPED BASS was crispy on the outside, and cooked perfect on the inside. My favorite was the Piquillo Pepper Clam Chowder under the bass. It was packed with different layers of flavors, and it was not spicy! Fantastic!  The meal was great. For the two of us, our check was about $120. The food was very good. Bobby has lived up to his reputation. I definitely respect him more. I would love to go back again. This time, I will save some rooms for dessert!",

The place was busy but they still managed to sit us at our table right around 9:30.  The hubby and I started out with some cocktails (the mesa grill margarita and the white peach margarita).  Both pricey, but delicious.  For apps, I had the shrimp/corn tamale and the hubby had the mushroom quesdailla.  And OMG, soooo tasty!  For our entrees I had the 16 spice chicken and the hubby had the chipotle glazed ribeye.  Our meal did not definitely disappoint.  My chicken was so moist and flavorful.  I was full about 3/4 of the way through but just had to finish it because it was that food.  The hubby thoroughly enjoyed his entree.

    "text": "Located inside the massive compound that is Caesar's Palace; Mesa Grill is brilliantly juxtaposed between the Corinthian columns and marble statues of ancient Greece and the impressive sports book and gaming tables of modern Vegas.  The restaurant's facade is cool, it is elegant and refined, yet laid back and calls to mind the island feel of the Caribbean.  We arrived a few minutes early for our reservation and were invited graciously to sit at the bar.  We promptly obtained drinks from the bartender, and were ushered to our table without issue.  However, our server seemed displeased that we had ordered drinks from the bar thus lessening his sale for our table.  We ordered two of the Tiger shrimp tamales which arrived at an unsettlingly fast pace.  Any hesitation by the \"fast-food\" speed with which they appeared was soon dashed by the overwhelming deliciousness that sprang forth from the plates.  Having eaten at many superb restaurants I feel compelled to say that these are some of the best starters I have yet to experience.  After the table was cleared I sat in anticipation for the main courses to arrive.  Our table had ordered two of the Coffee Rubbed Filets, one of the Black Angus Strips and one Chipotle Glazed Ribeye as well as an order of collard greens, mashed potatoes and, upon recommendation of the server, an order of Brussel sprouts.  My steak arrived and I noted how truly pleasing it was to the eye; however, I was disheartened that such an exquisite piece of meat seemed over powered by the bountiful amount of sauce on the plate.  Once I had cut into my steak and taken a bite I was instantaneously reminded that this was Chef Bobby Flay's house and his cooking was inextricably linked to him.  The protein on my plate was classic and refined and delicious, yet it had been arrogantly and flamboyantly altered to meet the needs of a Chef's personality.  The two sauces on the plate competed with the beef and reminded me of an episode of \"Throwdown\" except no one won, and my palate was an innocent bystander.  I looked for solace in the sides on the table and it was then I noticed that the recommended sprouts were missing.  After some time, we got the server's attention and asked him to forget the sprouts since we probably wouldn't need them or have room for them at this point.  He blatantly disregarded this request and demanded that we try them, because to do so would somehow be a personal affront to him.  We yielded.  When the sprouts arrived they were undercooked and over-seasoned to the point of sheer carelessness.  We each sampled one for the humor of it but left them on the table as a comedic reminder of how far off this meal had gone.  In summaton, this restaurant has the location, the ambience and the kitchen to be elite.  Yet when given an opportunity to let the cuisine evolve into greatness, it seems the staff from the highest to lowest get in the way of their own success.",

I had the 16 spice chicken, and it was a tasty entree. Though, now that I am writing this review a while down the road, nothing particularly stood out to me though.  However, if you want to dine in a big restaurant, owned by a big chef, and Southwestern is your thang, I'd say check it out.",

    "text": "We have been wanting to try Mesa Grill ever since I have been watching Bobby Flay on the Food Network. We finally decided to make it a point to try it the next time we were in Vegas and so this is how it went...   I made reservations for two at around 1230pm the same day for dinner at 930pm on a Thurs night, no problem, they use a service to take the reservation and take a credit card number to hold the reservation. They charge a $50 per person holding fee if you back out of the reservation after 300pm. No problem with that; this is to discourage anybody from simply calling to make reservations and not showing up. We showed up a little early at 900pm and they were able to give us the next table for two that opened up; this was significant since there was a party of 4 who arrived just before us who didn't have reservations and they were told that the wait was going to be an hour.   We sat down at the bar to wait and ordered a couple of drinks: a Partida margarita and a cactus pear ice tea (nonalcoholic). The margarita was good but it also tasted a bit on the tangy side; the ice tea which was unsweetened tasted like an ordinary unsweetened ice tea without any seeming cactus pear taste (maybe it's not meant to be since this is the only ice tea that they offer). After about 10 minutes our table was ready and we had our drinks transferred to our table.   They have a pretty extensive list of wine but we skipped it since we already had our drinks and I don't drink very much anyway. The waitress was very friendly, attentive, and helpful the entire evening. She took her time and explained everything about the menu and even made some recommendations based on our preferences.   We shared an appetizer of Rough Cut Tuna \"Nachos\" with Mango-Habanero Hot Sauce and Avocado Crema. This was a mound of tuna tartar on a bed of the two sauces flanking either side with regular and blue tortilla disks stacked and layed out like pringles. Surprisingly, the avocado crema had a slight kick to it and the mango-habanero was mostly sweet, I was expecting it to be the other way around but after watching Bobby Flay on tv, I remember that he likes to offer surprises in his food in unexpectedly tasty ways. Although I'm sure that the fish dishes are good, I didn't want to come to a place called Mesa Grill and order a fish dish, I wanted to order something off the grill like beef or pork and sample his renowned southwest flair. The tuna was tasty and was a perfect compromise to get a sample of his fish and still have room for the main course.   For entries, she ordered the grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops, two generously thick medium-rare shoulder chops served with a Jalapeno-Mint sauce and a well made plantain tamale. Tasty but a little tougher than expected, maybe we were expecting Frenched lamb chops like a rack of lamb but in any case we both liked what I had better: the Fire Roasted Veal Chop. This was also a generously large single veal chop with a horseradish-maple glaze that had a slight kick to it but didn't interfere with the taste of the tender flavorful juicy veal chop. The exposed bone was leaning on top of a beautiful little wild rice filled tamale with sage butter. Wonderful melt in your mouth tenderness and flavor.   We needed something sweet to finish off all of the various flavors and textures we just experienced and so we shared a banana creme pie served upside-down with crispy thin vanilla(?) wafer on top of it. A perfect combination of sweet and crispy texture to finish the meal.   The atmosphere was casual but nice with elegant touches but understated and not stuffy at all. The food was a little pricey, especially the main dishes, but actually not too bad considering how satisfied we were. I would like to come again to try some more dishes.   Entertaining side story: My wife excused herself to wash her hands when we were done but came out of the ladies room and told me that she would wait and use another restroom in Caesar's... the reason being that when she entered the ladies room, she could hear someone else in one of the stalls driving the big ceramic bus and puking her guts out! Eeeewwwwww, Gross! I guess even a fancy place like Mesa Grill can have someone who was probably inexperienced and drank to excess at the bar... 'what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas...'",

    "text": "I had dinner this evening with my family at the Mesa Grill, celebrity chef Bobby Flay's restaurant at  Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. I had made reservations on Open Table prior to coming to town, but was running late because the traffic on Las Vegas Boulevard was pretty bad. After I pulled into the Coliseum Valet (which is free, by the way), I told the attendant that I was running late. He pointed out to me where the restaurant is located (it was my first time) and told me that he would call the restaurant to let them know that I was coming. Much appreciated!   It was an early dinner reservation, even though I was late, and the restaurant was about half full when we arrived. By the time dinner ended, however, it seemed like the whole restaurant was full.   We had lamb porterhouse chops served with two sauces (preserved serrano sauce and mint chimichurri) and a blue corn tamale, coffee rubbed filet mignon with roasted corn, black angus new york steak strip with mashed potatoes, and baby romaine salad with roasted garlic dressing and hominy croutons (how unique). Every single entree was cooked perfectly, and each bite was delicious from beginning to end.   The service at the restaurant was top-notch. We were promptly seated when we arrived (we had reservations), our orders were taken quickly, and our food was delivered to our table within 10 minutes of ordering. Our waitress Brenda was wonderful, and all of our servers were very attentive. As we left the restaurant, we were greeted by at least half a dozen staff members.   The food was bit pricey, but well worth the culinary experience. My family and I don't come to Vegas often, but I felt that since we were here, we might as well indulge a bit and enjoy ourselves--we certainly did that at Mesa Grill.",

We came here for lunch in regular street clothes.  The female waitress/server was extremely smug.  I'm guessing she was just flat out stereotyping us due to the way we were dressed.  I saw another table that she was handling and the men were dressed in business attire.  I just find it pathetic that she looked down upon us bc we weren't dressed.  By the way this was on a Tuesday during lunch hours.",

    "text": "Ate here after the 1/2 marathon!  Here's the rundown of the dishes I ate, and what I thought: (First off, a well-deserved cocktail:  I had a margarita, of course!  It was good.)  Bread basket - I only ate one slice since I didn't want to ruin my meal, but I thought the bread was average - the butter they served with it was noticeably good, though.  Appetizer - 'Rough Cut Tuna Nachos':  I have no idea what is 'nacho' about this appetizer, but if you like tuna tartare you will love this appetizer.  The capers, the mango puree, the little chips they served to scoop it up with - all super delicious.  The tuna was high quality.  Entree - 'Coffee-Rubbed Filet Mignon' - delicious!  My steak was cooked perfectly, was a great cut of meat, and the coffee and ancho chile on the outside really added a lot of flavor.  This was a big win for me.  Side - 'Fresh Corn Tamale + Jalapeno Pesto Butter' - I was not a fan of this.  The tamale was not very moist, and basically tasted like a plain corn tamale that you would get at any regular Mexican restaurant - I didn't really get any flavor from the jalapeno pesto butter that was on it, either.. I can't believe I paid ten bucks for a crappy plain tamale!    Dessert - 'Churros' - not so great.  These churros were pretty weak - they were not fluffy, there was no slightly gooey center and crispy outer.  The sauces were also not very good - there was barely any sauce served with the churros (dunking was impossible) and neither of the sauces had strong (or notable) flavor - I would have preferred one small creamer pot of good mexican chocolate for dipping.  Service was very good - our waiter had the right frequency of checking in, and was very tolerant of us being one of the last people in the restaurant.  Really, I want to give Mesa Grill 3 or 3.5 stars because of the inconsistency in quality of dishes across all parts of dinner, but on the strength of the appetizer and main dish, I will go ahead and give them 4 stars..  I found the pricing to be appropriate to slightly on the high side (but not so expensive where I felt like the food was overpriced).",

I like the rabbit is cooked well and juicy; the sauce complements it well.  Bill came up to $150 without tip.   I guess I expected a lot.

The perfectly cooked shrimp with the sweetness of the corn mixed with the creaminess of the tamales and sauce was pure bliss to my taste buds. I almost wanted to order another for my entree.   Cornmeal Crusted Chile Relleno: Nice smoky flavor with a spicy kick to it. The cornmeal added a nice crust that contrasted well with the eggplant and gooey cheese inside.   New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich: Disappointing. The pork was tough, dry and lacked flavor. Nothing in it stood out and my husband only ate half of the sandwich.   There were some issues with the seating that tainted our overall experience. We brought it up to the management and they did their best to make it up to us. Unfortunate situation since I had high expectations for my first time eating here but the food speaks for itself and the majority of what we ordered were unique and flavorful.",

I was finally at my favorite chef's actual sit-down restaurant. Once again, kudos to the designer!!!!.... From the warm colors to the motif made by the wood work above the bar, the floors, even the bathrooms were NICE!... I was impressed. My wife had actually been here before. It was my first time.  Okay, we sit down and place our orders with our server Arnel E. He definitely had a good grasp of the menu. Instead of typical bread, they leave this pancake/muffin-ie bread basket!!.. HOW YOU START ME OFF LIKE THAT BOBBY!... I knew this going to be  GREAT experience!!.. All I could do was shake my head, close my eyes and enjoy. My wife got a good laugh out of that!... WOW!!!... We started with the roasted shishito peppers, which can never be done wrong. The char was just right and the cheese added a real deep and nice smokiness to them. VERY good. My wife got the ancho chile honey glazed salmon. O.M.L. IT was FAN-TASTIC!!!!... We both were like WHAT!?... The spicy bean sauce, tomatillos and jalapeno crema!!!.. What else is there left to type!?. NOTHING!. I had the grilled lamb porterhouse chops.  Wait... Okay. Like on the t.v. shows the presentations were OFF THE CHAIN!... Like Emeril's place the crew of servers work like a well oiled machine. They worked a CREW for real!... Okay... the chops were SOOOO freakin good. I started eating remnants from the bones by hand!!!!!!!!!!... THE BEST SET OF LAMB CHOPS I have EVER-EVER! EVER-EVER HAD/EATEN/DEVOURED!!!!!.... HANDS-DOWN!. Even the freakin corn was GREAT!... WHAT!...... We finished the meal with churros. They were a perfect bite to finish a FANTASTIC MEAL!!!!.. The chocolate sauce was not too sweat, but nice and warm, like velvet!...   This was by far one of the best food experiences I have had in my adult life (thus far)... My hat, shirt and boots are off to the chefs, servers and ENTIRE crew!... If I ever get back to Vegas this WILL BE a spot I will hit again!.  A+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++A",

    "text": "Big fan of Mesa Grill, especially for lunch.   Their menu is very reasonably priced for a fancy casino restaurant and although their menu isn't extremely extensive, they have quite a few dishes to choose from. On this occasion, I shared a Mesa Burger and a Swordfish club with fellow Yelper. The burger was extremely moist and delicious. This was lunch date's favorite dish. The sandwich was really good. Filled with tons of avocado, bacon and swordfish between two (slightly too thick) slices of bread. The french fries were perfectly seasoned.  We finished our meal with a slice of coconut cake and the mango rum upside down cake. Both were fantastic as well.  Service was great. Our glasses never went unfilled and the waitstaff was extremely attentive. I highly recommend this place.",

I had the Lamb Porterhouse with Tamale and sides of Spinach and Sweet Potatoes. All was delicious - we first sat at the bar to wait for table. Bad thing no draught beers here - only bottles. The bartender handed us breadsticks, which had a nice spicy element. After a 45 minute wait, we finally were taken to our table. The waiter was nice however did not give us the lowdown on the fare, as a typical establishment of this type is expected to - maybe he was too busy?  When the food arrived, the lamb was cooked a little under, however seasoned well and had a nice spicy kick from the serrano peppers on top. The sweet poatatoes were sweet and had a nice firm bite, not hard or raw. The spinach also was good.  Overall the food was good but not impressive as you would an Iron Chef restaurant to be.",

So we came here without reservation and were seated immediately. So I think it is absolutely no sense to make reservation.   Interior was comfortable and designed well. It has very nice and colorful bar. The space is divided into areas. We had our seats in the dining area. Ambiance was restful. Nice place to have a rest with friends and talk a little.   We took blue corn pancake BBQ duck, smoked salmon, tuna nachos and shrimp tacos. After all these got inside us, I can't say I am impressed with food. Food look and design were more impressive. I was impressed with margarita as well, I really loved it.  No claims to service. It was good, servers were attentive and helped us with info about dishes on the menu. Thanks guys.   Next time if we decide to come here, we definitely will come fed and sit in the bar area and enjoy margaritas.",

CIOPPINO So very good. I thought the green chile sauce was phenomenal. We finished every bite. The mussels are a bit small, but very tasty nonetheless. The shrimp is amazing, and the linguistini was also delicious.  HOT SAUCE We asked for hot sauce and they brought out two kinds. The red one was just ok, a little smoky, but that's it. The green one has the perfect kick of spice, not too much that it kills the taste of the steak/seafood, but just enough to make a little zing.   HEFEWEIZEN The one we got didn't taste like a hefeweizen, but it was still good nonetheless. They come in huge glasses so drink up!  IPA  My friend got the IPA and really liked it. I didn't get to try it, but it's a nice big tall glass of beer.",

    "text": "You know, I've always been conflicted about trying this place. On one hand, Bobby Flay has annoyed me ever since he offended Morimoto on Iron Chef. On the other hand, I really like southwestern style food, and he's supposedly good at coming up with versions of it.   So there we were, my boyfriend and I, in Vegas a little earlier than expected because we made most of the drive ahead of time to avoid a snowstorm. In fact, we were here in time for lunch (instead of just to St. George). We couldn't decide what to do with our extra meal, so we moseyed into Caesar's and were greeted by the Mesa Grill. We were curious, so we went in.   It was Saturday afternoon, and therefore brunch time, so my boyfriend started with a mimosa. However, I couldn't resist our waiter's suggestion of one of the margaritas. I can't remember what they called it, but it was as smooth as he said it was supposed to be. I don't usually like margaritas, but I was down with this.   For our entrees, Alan got the Spicy Scrambled Eggs and I got the Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad. Both were very good. The chicken in the salad was perfectly seasoned, and the dressing and goat cheese complimented it nicely. The eggs also had a good amount of goat cheese, and the combination of spices gave a great unique flavor. The ham the accompanied the dish was probably the highlight, though.   Service was pretty slow, but our waiter was very nice when he did come by. Prices were high, but it's Vegas.   I guess I'll forgive Bobby Flay for his Iron Chef ills for now (it's been long enough, right?), and I'll even go as far to say that I'd love to try this place for dinner sometime.",

I'm going to contact the restaurant, but haven't yet as we just got back.  I had the \"Spicy Chicken, Sweet Potato Hash with poached eggs, green chile hollandaise\".  It was decent but not exceptional. The waiter said it was the spiciest thing on the menu, but it didn't seem spicy to me at all.  I'm wondering if the poached eggs is what made me ill.    My cousin had the burger, and she liked it.  My husband had...well, I forget.    Anyway, I was very disappointed by my experience here.  I had looked forward to having lunch at Mesa Grill, and being sick for nearly two days because of a meal was not a rewarding experience.  I can't think of anything other than food poisoning given my symptoms, which I'll spare you.",

    "text": "MESA Grill gets 3.5 stars in my book.  3 of us came here for brunch on a Saturday around 12pm and was told that there'd be a 10 minute wait.  I said to my friend -- there's a table right there, why do we have to wait? 10 minutes later, lo and behold -- which table do they give us? the one that has been empty this whole time.  Maybe they just wanted to make it seem crowded with their lounge full of people waiting for a table.  Service: Service was slow but decent.  It took a long time to get water refills but we did get everything that we asked for.  The 3 of us drank a ton of mimosas and quickly got really rowdy.  The server didn't seem to mind.  Food: TIGER SHRIMP ROASTED GARLIC CORN TAMALE: we shared the tiger shrimp tamales and it was the best thing that I ate at MESA Grill.  The sauce was spot on, spicy and tangy and the prawns were cooked to perfection.  I believe the dish came with 4 prawns.  CRISPY BACON + HASH BROWN QUESADILLA I wish I would have enjoyed this dish as it sounded super appetizing on the menu.  However, it was just OK in my opinion.  The bacon really wasn't crispy and the quesadilla was on the dry side.  SPICY SCRAMBLED EGGS The eggs in this dish were prepared well.  It was decent, but nothing to write home about.  GRITS surprisingly, the grits was one of the most flavorful items that came to the table.  We joked that we don't even know why we ordered grits but in the end we enjoyed it.  I probably won't be returning to MESA grill since there are plenty of restaurants in Vegas.  However, I would recommend it to someone who was looking for tex-mex with signature flavors that tends to be on the spicy-tangy side.  Lunch was expensive but I think the prices are fair when compared to hotel cafes.  P.S. they have a delicious chocolate tequila on their dessert menu!",

I made reservations 3 weeks in advanced and upon walking in, we were seated within 2-3 minutes. We were greeted by our server who was very nice and went over the menu for us.   We got a complimentary bread basket with an assortment of breads. The blue corn muffins were my favorite.   We ordered the lamb posole, pan seared halibut, black angus new york strip steak, coffee rubbed filet mignon, 22 oz bone-in chipotle glazed rib-eye, and they were all great! But the best was the rib-eye. It was rare, fatty, juicy, huge, and melted in your mouth. Drool. The filet mignon and new york strip was also very tender and delicious. The lamb posole had a lot of flavor and was really good, and the fish was light and also had a lot of great flavors.   This restaurant is worth coming back to for sure.",

We started out with the cactus pear margarita--it was a gorgeous pink color and definitely tasty. A little bit too sweet for my taste, but still good and fresh tasting.   We had the tuna nachos and goat cheese fundido as appetizers. I don't eat seafood but the three other people in our party loved the nachos. I personally loved the goat cheese fundido--really flavorful with bell peppers pieces mixed in.   For dinner, our table ordered the rib eye, yucatan chicken tacos, and the chile relleno. Oh man, does Bobby Flay know how do flavor! The sauces on each dish were intricate and absolutely amazing. I've never had such a good chile relleno. I don't like eggplant usually,  but I couldn't even tell it was there. The tacos were great as well, with a great mixture of mint and cilantro to top them with (who knew those two mixed so well on tacos?!. The boys loved their rib eye.   Our server was perfect, which made the meal even better. We ended dinner with some Don Julio tequila, great for sipping. Thanks for a wonderful dinner, Mesa Grill!",

I kept finding myself trying to pick out things instead of eating it as a whole... not impressed with it at all..  Also, had the mesa burger last time i came here.. wasnt impressed with it either.

Our visit started out a hit when we got to watch Bobby Flay himself filming an episode of Throwdown in the kitchen!!  We weren't allowed in the restaurant yet, but watching through the windows was fun :)  Dr. S started out with a cactus pear margarita (I think) that I totally drank all of because it was so tasty!  We had the corn soup with fried okra and green chili oil to start, and it was heavenly.  I wanted to lick the bowl clean.  I remember the sweet potato soup I had on the prior visit was just as delicious.  He then got the cuban burger with fries and I got the blue corn crusted halibut with tomatoes, capers and olives.  I liked the burger more than my husband did but refused to switch because the halibut was even better!!!  We kind of split both dishes and each bite was more delicious than the last.  The fish was cooked absolutely perfectly, not fishy, not dry, just beautiful succulent white fish.    I convinced Dr. S that we NEEDED to get dessert, even though we were both stuffed.  The buttermilk pineapple upside down cake with caramel sauce didn't disappoint!!!  It's actually one of my favorite desserts because my mom used to make it for me when I was younger.  This version, of course, blew hers out of the water, but it definitely brought me to that warm fuzzy place.    We have had some good food in Vegas, but honestly on this last trip, I left the most satisfied after this meal because everything from the service to the food was just executed perfectly.    Thanks Bobby!!!  Next time indulge me in a damn picture please!",

I guess I've taught them too well because they use this place as one of their benchmarks where ever we go. the tamale is great and can be a desert but it's a side dish!!!! We had the churro for desert and oh wow!!!!! It beats a lot of good churros from the neighborhood back home in east la and Pasadena. The deserts are sooooo good, they make you want more!!! They must have laced it with crack or something because man I'm still thinking about it several weeks later now as I write this review. Cheers to the staff and all the chefs in the back! You guys all rock! See you next time hopefully #bobbyflay will be there.",

Mesa Grill didn't disappoint -- they start you off with a bread basket with various breads and muffins. The jalapeno cornbread was my favorite.  We got the tuna nachos appetizer, and it was what you typically expect from an ahi tuna tartare. Not really anything special there, aside from the fancy-cut chips. They were good, but not mind-blowing. I probably wouldn't get them again next time, and go for a more adventurous app.  The Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash was great. It had great depth of flavor and spice -- it also had kind of a vinegar-y kick to it that balanced out the starchy sweetness of the potato. Awesome dish.  The New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin sandwich was also a great choice. The pork was perfectly cooked, and the sauce and arugula complemented the tender pork.  Great meals both times I've been here -- and worth the slightly high price tag to say you've been to one of Bobby's restaurants.",

So much so that I decided to host a 50th birthday lunch for my husband and our 15 guests in their private room at the rear of the restaurant.  Our special menu items included Sophie's Chopped Salad, New Mexican Spice Rubbed Tenderloin or Sixteen Spice Chicken, and Toasted Coconut Layer Cake.  The chopped salad was tasty though I could've done without the large cubes of cheese.  I didn't try the chicken but guests who ordered it said it was very good.  The pork tenderloin was juicy and flavorful.  The rub was not so spicy (for me) and paired with the sweet potato tamale made it a perfect combination.  The coconut cake was moist and just the right amount of sweet.    James, our server, was wonderfully attentive and knowledgeable.  Side note...get the sweet potato clam chowder, too...even if you don't necessarily care for clams like me.  And the don't eat too much from the bread basket if you can.  They are delicious but will fill you up fast.  Oh...and can't forget the margaritas...get one!",

It was our first night and after winning a grip of change form the slots at Caesar's, my friend suggested eating at Mesa Grill for din din.  I wasn't too familiar with the restaurant but when I realized it was Bobby Flay's joint, my interest was certainly piqued.    Truth be told, i'm not a Flay fanatic by an stretch, but a little star power never hurt anyone IMO.  With that said, there's always the pressing issue of hype over substance which in turn had me proceeding with cautious optimism.    As we made our way across the bustling casino and stepped into the restaurant, I definitely felt the warmth of the contemporary Latin theme throughout the communal dining space, which was flanked with rich reds and soft golden hues.   Within moments, the hostess greeted us and proceeded to lead us to our seats.  Our server wasted no time in taking our orders, as well.  In record time, we got our beautifully plated appetizers and entrees.  Let's just say my doubts melted away with my very first bite! Wow, this food had big, bold flavor and the quality was incredible!   Here's a rundown of what we had:  Shrimp tamale - Plump, juicy and mouthwatering gulf shrimp in a fresh corn meal that was both rich & flavorful. Outstanding!   Tuna nachos - Fresh chunks of seasoned ruby red tuna in a sweet & tangy sauce that had a pleasant citrusy finish. The crisp corn tortilla added a nice contrast in texture to this refreshingly vibrant dish! Lip smacking goodness in every bite!  Pork tenderloin - This dish was absolutely phenomenal!!! The meat was like a perfectly cooked filet! It was soft, buttery and rich. Perfectly decadent and oh so flavorful! Honestly, the meat was so tender, i kept asking my friends \"Are you sure this is pork?\"   Spice Filet - Buttery, tender and succulent beef filet with a pleasant kick from the house spices! Scrumptious!  Lamb chops - Beautiful crust and perfectly pink inside. Boasting a magnificent charbroiled flavor that was absolutely addicting! Seconds please!  Corn - Fresh cuts of corm kernels with explosive flavor and fantastic texture. This is a side you don't wanna miss!  After consuming all that delicious food, we simply had no additional room for dessert. Besides, wehad our minds set on some chocolate decadence at Max Brenner's afterwards (review forthcoming)  Overall, service was attentive, friendly and fast. The food, of course, was incredible and most importantly, it didn't break the bank either!  Why? Because this birthday boy didn't have to pay...lol  Happy Eats!",

I ordered the scallops and they were good, but I really enjoyed the sweet potato side dish. It was very flavorful. Quite impressive, considering I usually don't much care for sweet potato dishes.  Other standout items were the Tiger shrimp. I traded one of my scallops for one and it was an excellent trade.  Because my Aunt and I were both eating Gluten free they brought out some blue corn chips for us while the others noshed on bread. It was a nice touch.   Service was excellent and the decor is nice.",

Tuna tartare nachos served uniquely with tortilla rounds and fresh tuna tartare, mind blowing appetizer. The bread basket wth blue corn muffins and sourdough with jalapenos and raisin bread were all signature Booby flay, had immense flavor with a slight kick to it. Now to the real reason for the five star rating . The Chile cheese burger , My Oh My ..... !! Loaded with roasted  poblano , pickled onions and Mexican cheese makes this the best burger on the planet. It's flavor profile is indescribable . The southwest fries was icing on the cake . This food has hat eclectic South west flair . Don't miss this place not coz of the food but coz Bobby is best !",

Something in this place just seems old and dated... the service was fantastic though and I absolutely loved my house margarita.",

It's obvious this place is a tourist trap with no integrity behind its food.  I'm guessing that the positive reviews are from so called self proclaimed \"foodies\" that want to show off that they ate here.",

The food was incredible but the sauces took our meal to a new level. We started with apps. Squash blossoms and the grilled shrimp tamale. Then main courses of the chipotle rib eye that melts in your mouth. The ancho chili and honey glazed salmon as well as the spiced rubbed pork tenderloin. There is nothing bad I can say about anything we had. The entire dining experience was wonderful. Deanna, our server, was great. We will be back to try other menu items and work our way through the margarita menu too.",

I sat at the bar and had the MOST unfriendly women bartender I have ever met. She barely spoke to me and made me feel like I was an interruption to her day. I tried to make conversation and smile, but she wanted nothing of it.   When seated for dinner, they brought a bread basket. Was excited to try to the cornbread that is featured in reviews.  So not impressed. Taste was good, but it had no structure and just fell apart when I tried to eat it (have you never heard of eggs to hold muffins together???).   A friend told me about the Shrimp tamales and that they were to die for.  Not so much.  It tasted like a chain restaurant meal. Nice presentation, but not a remarkable dish. No flavor.   Won't be going back. Thought I would have an experience and it turned into just a meal.  Sorely disappointed.",

    "text": "Once again, Bobby Flay did not disappoint! We have been to Mesa Grill before, but probably not since over 5 years ago, and I must say, our experience this time was just as great as the first!   We actually arrived about 45 minutes early for our reservation because we overestimated how long it would take to park and walk from the parking garage with my 84 year old grandmother. The staff was so accommodating upon our arrival that no longer than 5 minutes after we checked in for our reservation, they seated us!   After ordering drinks, the server brought out a bread basket with some absolutely lovely little samplings! The cornbread muffins had just enough spice and were not too crumbly, and the blueberry coffee cake was perfectly moist with a nice crunchy streusel topping. My one complaint was that because the restaurant is tucked into the casino of Caesar's Palace, the cigarette smoke from the surrounding areas wafts into the restaurant and it became pretty noticeable while we were beginning to eat. Not overpowering, just a minor inconvenience.   We tried 5 different entrees from the Sunday Brunch menu and would definitely recommend any of the 5! They were phenomenal! The 5 we ordered were: 16 spice chicken salad (lots of smooth yummy goat cheese! So good) Spicy scramble (not THAT spicy, has very thinly sliced jalapeno peppers in it) Spicy chicken sweet potato hash (comes with two deliciously runny poached eggs!) Mesa Burger (Bobby Flay is rightly called the Grill Master. Excellent burger) Spice rubbed pork sandwich (Large portion and so yummy!)  A word of caution: the spicy chicken sweet potato hash is AMAZING and full of flavor but was too spicy for the person in our party who ordered it so I ended up swapping dishes with them, but I thoroughly enjoyed it because I love spicy food.  Service was great! No complaints there. Drinks were filled without prompting any time they were starting to get low, and our server checked in many times to make sure the allergies we had discussed with him upon ordering were properly handled by the kitchen.  All in all, the food is extremely reasonably priced considering the portions and how truly satisfying and delicious it is, and we can't wait to go back!",

We had a group of 4 for brunch and everything was going well until our check arrived.  Our server after we asked if we could get our bill split looked at us like children and said, \"I could but it would take 15 mins and my manager would have to do it in the back room.\"  Really? What modern day POS system doesn't allow split checks?   We had been in Vegas two other nights with larger parties with no issues, but we dine at mesa grill and have a road block?  With Vegas being a Mecca for foodies you might as well skip this place and dine where you feel more welcome, and not talked down upon.  We have been here two other times before but this is our last.  Sorry Mesa but one server rubbed our group the wrong way.",

The customer service was excellent and our waiter would always check up on us if we needed anything else.  I ordered the steak with side of corn and mashed potatoes.  I love the way they cooked the steak because it had a little burnt crust to it.  I had it medium rare and it was perfect.  The sides were delicious as well!

    "text": "Came here with my girl for a friday night dinner before a show. I have wanted to try this place for a long time and just never had the chance. Although I am a pretty big Bobby Flay Fan, that wasn't the main reason for coming here. We came because the menu looked good.   I am from so-cal, so we have a lot of mexican(ish) food choices, from taco trucks to high-end restaurants, so I came well-versed in the cuisine. I'll admit I had pretty high expectations.   First, the service was great. We were on a schedule because we had to see a show in a couple hours and our waiter was very nice in making sure that we had enough time to enjoy the meal, but was also conscious of our needed departure time. He was very quick with drink orders and food ordering. He was not hovering over the table every 5 seconds, but did make sure our drinks and water were never empty.   We started the fundido, which although a little different, was fantastic. Really worth a try. I like Javier's version as well, but this quite the kick and unique flavor due to the peppers and goat cheese.   Wife had the spiced chicken and I had the chile relleno. The chicken was very moist, cripsy skin and interesting flavor. I didnt love it, but I didnt hate it either. Definitely different. The relleno was just OK. In my opinion it shouldn't be listed as a entre. It would be a good appetizer. It was BIG, but just fell kinda flat in the taste department.   We both had various kinds of margaritas, which were just OK. Not bad, not the worst i've had by FAR, but nothing that would make me say \"We should go back there for those margs\".   Prices are high, and I understand it's the vegas strip, everything is expensive, but I just kind of felt like it was too high for what we got. I dont mind paying high prices for great food, but this was just ok.   I am giving 4 stars because I felt like it's a \"different\" option for Vegas (cant eat steak every night!) which is great and nothing was really bad, just not spectacular. Service was spot-on.   Is it worth a try? YES, and I'm glad we came. Would I go back? Probably not, but that's mainly because there are SO many good food choices in Vegas.",

Our waiter was as nice as could be, but it was very obvious that he was overworked.  He was covering an entire section of about 10 tables (all with 4+ guests) and he had a hard time providing enough attention to each one.  This was not his fault, but management's.  We ordered the Goat Cheese Queso Fundido the second we sat down--it arrived nearly an hour later with our entrees.  Our drinks took about 30 minutes to be served.  All in all, brunch with 5 people took nearly 2.5 hours.  Be prepared to wait...and wait.",

They had a separate room set for us so it just added to the experience. Everything from the drinks to the food is perfect. Both times we've been here we've never been disappointed, from the food to the service. But the food! This is where I fell in love with sweet corn tamales. The chefs really know how to balance the heat of the chilies, you get a little zing but the flavors in the food are just right.

Ok, if you're expecting to see some Thomas Keller or Michael Mina action here, don't be fooled, you ain't gonna get it here. If you want a fine dining experience, go to a Keller, Mina or Ogden establishment.  With that being said, the price point for brunch was spot on (below Payard's) and the food looked and tasted good. Loved the bread basket! My fav: the jalapeno biscuits.   Inquiry: What's the difference between cactus pear iced tea and regular iced tea? Both looked the same and I wasn't sure if I even got it.  Bobby's version of Scrambled Eggs Chilaquiles is amazing. I recommend it. Overall, brunch was solid. If you can't get into Payard's, Mesa Grill is another good option.",

I swiped my meat with the cranberry compote that came with my friend's lamb dish ( OMG SO GOOD... i only had a bite, but i wish i had ordered it - it was juicy, tender and cooked perfectly and i liked the cranberry sauce that came with it)   Dessert -- dessert sampler --- i liked teh empanadas teh best because it came with yummy ice cream.  the chocolate cake was ok at best, i've had more decadent ones... and i didn't care for the burnt orange cheesecake -- just tasted like burnt sourness.

BREAD: Cornbread, Jalapeo bread, raisin bread. I would of liked it more if it was warmed especially the cornbread.  RESERVATIONS:  We made reservations at 8pm and we were promptly seated.    ATTIRE:  Mixed.  Some wore fancy business suits, some showed up in slippers/flip flops.  APPETIZER:  TIGER SHRIMP + ROASTED GARLIC CORN TAMALE Corn-Cilantro Sauce. $16.   Fresh tasting popping corn.  Tamale was slightly cold.  Well presented.    ENTREE:  FIRE ROASTED VEAL CHOP Horseradish-Maple Glaze Wild Rice Tamale + Sage Butter 42. (D really enjoyed it whith a side of wild rice tamale)  NEW MEXICAN SPICE RUBBED PORK TENDERLOIN Bourbon-Ancho Chile Sauce Sweet Potato Tamale + Crushed Pecan Butter 36. (I'm not sure if I tasted the bourbon but it was definitely flaming)   AMBiENCE:  Colorful.  A lot of loyal fans ( I witnessed two parties sitting alone and just purely enjoyed the food).    RUMOR has it that he will be at the restaurant April 2nd or 3rd.  DESSERT:   I was disappointed.  They did not have:   Toasted Pecan Vanilla Tart Carrot-Apricot Sorbet + Ginger-Vanilla Syrup 12.  So we tried the Warm Caramel Pineapple Empanada Orange-Pineapple Ice Cream + Caramel-Tequila Sauce 11.  which I thought was so-so.  Nothing spectacular.   Would I come back? Probably not.",

The waitstaff was not only nice, and professional, but really funny as well (maybe it was the cute six girls).   The only complaint some of us had (not I, dear ones) is that the beverages took awhile to appear.    The food was delicious.  Even the tough critics enjoyed their meals.  We particularly liked the pesto mashed potato,  the wasabi baked potato, the black bean chili relleno, the ny strip and the duck.    See ya soon Bobby!   Dinner and a couple of drinks $430 for six people.",

Got the New York strip with a side of mashed potatoes (holy crap it had pesto in it?!?!?) and had the flourless chocolate cake for dessert.  Best food I've ever had.  Service was ridiculously good.  Never had to ask for anything, they sensed my desires.  Went #1 and when I got back they had folded my napkin.  Wow.  Only peeve about this place was that we had a party of 10 and had 9 people and they wouldn't seat us until the 10th got there.  Lame.  I say what the hell we're gonna spend almost 1k here just seat us and get over yourselves.  But, overall, I see why Michelin rated them so high on their list.  Great food, great service.  It's what I use as a bar for other restaurants, and honestly it isn't even fair.  In one sentence: Mesa Grill is the place to go for food orgasms.",

Wanted to see if it's all TV smoke and mirrors.  It's not.  Based on the meals our group of four enjoyed, Bobby Flay is the real deal.    Three of us ordered the prize fixe menu and the fourth ordered the halibut.   Everyone enjoyed every course.   Standouts include the Tiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale, the New York strip steak and the Cilantro mashed potatoes.  The Dulce chocolate pudding was delicious decadence on a plate.   Also notable is the drink menu which includes a wide selection of margaritas and tequilas.  The service was top notch.   I highly recommend this place.   The only thing that could have made it better was if Bobby Flay had been there.",

I love Bobby flay's take on southwestern cuisine, it's fun and never lacking on flavor! I did the  summer prixe fix menu which offered a couple of the most well known dishes; the tiger shrimp with roasted garlic corn tamale and the New Mexico spice rubbed pork tenderloin with the dulce chocolate pudding for dessert. Everything tasted amazing, except for maybe the dessert which was a little lacking but the other dishes and the excellent service were far worth it!  Another highlight was the corn soup which my wife had, the smoky flavors were soooo good!!! Till next time!",

Both were very detailed plates that were DELICIOUS and made with perfectly cooked fish. Lunch was soooooo freaking amazing that I didn't eat all the bread I wanted too and saved room for dessert.

Perfect patty, charred just right on the outside, very good quality meat. Nick the bartender offered great customer service and a good (simple) Bloody Mary. This is about the burger though. GO HERE. This is one of those places I would say \"judge my tastes based on this recommendation\". Very, very solid meal. Very good fries.

We ordered the mahi mahi with jasmine rice, pork tenderloin with sweet potato tamale, churros, hot tea,  and of course drinks. Complimentary bread was brought out as well. Jalepeno muffins & jalepeno bread with a tab of butter.  All of the food was plated beautifully. The tenderloin was very nicely prepared. Table constantly cleared. Service is very courteous answering all questions and offering suggestions.   Interior is very modern. Plenty of seating from tables to table/ booths. Reservations are recommended however they take walk ins as well.   Location is Ceasars Palace- ample parking for a fee,  unless you choose other casinos.",

    "text": "Bobby Flay is one of girlfriend's celebrity chef crushes ever since she discovered Food Network and I have always wanted to try out his food because of his Southwestern flair and bold flavors. We were having a family reunion and had lunch with my brother.   ATMOSPHERE  The ambiance was modern, trendy and romantic. Lights semi dimmed which sets the romantic mood. Customer service was great, the waitress came to check on us frequently and was very attentive.    FACILITY I can't really give this place any less than 5 stars. It's Bobby Flay. It was definitely a great opportunity to gain an experience from a great chef.  INSIDE Since I'll probably never be fortunate enough to actually eat anything prepared by Bobby Flay himself I'll have to settle for eating at his restaurants thus Mesa Grill was an obvious choice for dining in Las Vegas. Located in Caesars Palace near the Omnia Nightclub - this is not a restaurant to pass up. Even the complimentary \"bread\" basket had some Southwestern flair in its biscuits and muffin of which we took   OUTSIDE There is no outdoor seating.   SERVICE  Friendly, efficient.  FOOD Great food, amazing service! We are from California and depend on Yelp reviews when out of town. This was a no brainer and boy, we were not disappointed. First time dining here with my girlfriend and they've definitely earned our business. Since we came at 11am on a Saturday, we were given the brunch menu. I had Spicy Scrambled Eggs. The flavors are just what you would expect from Bobby. The meal was beautifully cooked and just brings your breakfast to a new level. Helen had Crispy Bacon Hashbrown quesadilla. What an experience this was. It was great!",

The ice kept them nice and cold but did make getting those last sips next to impossible...catch-22. Oh I docked a Star as we sat at the bar while waiting for our table and the bartender ignored us...made initial contact but seemed put off and never acknowledged us again to take our order. Luckily our table was ready soon after. I wonder as I write this if the bartender was confused and thought we were using the seats to wait vs wanting to order a drink...regardless we were there to do both!  We shared the goat cheese queso fundida which was sooooo yummy and perfect amount for 4 ladies as it was rich. We enjoyed the blue corn chips with it as well. I was torn between a few dishes and settled on the Rabbit with Green Pea Couscous. So delicious and perfect amount of food. Being a rabbit virgin I noted the taste was reminiscent of chicken and texture more lol pork tenderloin so take that as you will. Another round of margs had us happy as we left full and ready to hit our next stop!",

    "text": "During a family ladies trip to Vegas, there was a good mixture of planned and unplanned times throughout the weekend.  Our first evening in town was an unplanned moment and I'm really glad it turned out that way because we ended up at Mesa Grill by default. After the long 5.5 hour drive to Sin City, unloading the car, checking into our room, and unpacking, we realized we were starving and hadn't a clue what we were going to do for dinner other than we knew we wanted to stick to our hotel (Caesar's Palace). After perusing our dining options, I went to Open Table only to find Mesa Grill with an availability that would fit into our schedule. The menu had my mouth watering, but I was even more excited when we found out upon arrival that it was actually Restaurant Week on the strip!   Mesa Grill is actually a Bobby Flay restaurant, so it's a pricey place to eat. Not only were the Restaurant Week menu options great, but the set price for an appetizer, entre, and dessert meal was a steal! Not to mention that a percentage of each Restaurant Week menu purchase donated meals to the homeless in Las Vegas.   After a tough choice, I opted to try the Caesar Salad, Grilled Salmon, and Chocolate Cake with Caramel drizzle (I really wish I had taken a photo of the menu for more detail). The Caesar Salad was pretty standard, but my salmon was absolutely amazing. The chef recommended it to be cooked medium to medium well, which is interesting because when I was at a high end restaurant in Washington DC last year, my salmon was recommended to be cooked at medium rare. I much preferred it cooked to Mesa Grill's suggestion. I was a little concerned because I like my steak to be medium rare, I don't like overly cooked meat, but the salmon came out so flavorful and flaky. When I ordered it medium rare last year, I remember thinking it was just a little too chewy and pink, which reminded me of un cooked sushi (not my cup of tea at all, yuck!). The chocolate cake was also delectable with soft cake, smooth icing, and a crunchy bottom exterior.   The highlight for me though, were the sides of roasted corn and cilantro pesto mashed potatoes that we ordered as table shareables. While Mexican food is my favorite type of food overall, mashed potatoes are my favorite dish. Any way a potato is cooked really, I'm such a potato head, but mashed potatoes are just heaven to me. I also absolutely love pesto and greatly enjoy the flavor of cilantro, but never thought about putting these three things together.  Doing so though, was a burst of flavor that my mouth didn't even know how to comprehend. And with all of that said, somehow, the roasted corn somehow blew the pesto mashed potatoes out of the water! The waitress said that we'd be fighting over who got the last spoonful, and she wasn't wrong! I know there was cotija cheese on them, but otherwise I have no idea what seasoning and other ingredients were sprinkled in and honestly it really doesn't matter.  Just do yourself a favor and order the side of roasted corn!   I also opted to try a white peach margarita. I love peach margaritas and perhaps love the white peach version of this drink even more. It was so refreshing and added the perfect amount of sweet flavor to balance out the Spanish spice of my food.   There are so many great restaurants in Las Vegas that I have yet to try, so I don't generally like to go to the same place twice, but I might have to make an exception for Mesa Grill!",

I am a total food network junkie and ALWAYS drool over bobby flay's food since it's right up my alley [love spicy and bold flavors]. was going to come here last year but never got the chance, so Paul and I were determined to make it this time. we came during brunch and without a reservation, only a 20 minute wait.    the interior is nice, as expected. I opted for the spicy scrambled eggs and Paul absolutely had to have the burger. you get this amazing ass bread basket with mini jalapeno cheddar biscuits [DE-FREAKING-LICIOUS], mini scones, and blue corn muffins. I had to stop myself from filling up on it.   on to the food! my eggs were perfect. tons of fresh jalapenos and a drizzle of some light green sauce, and goat cheese. the goat cheese was the perfect creamy accompaniment to the spicy jalapenos. love the fact it was actually spicy, as I hate ordering spicy food that turns out to be weak. the grits that came with it were the best I have EVER had, I don't know what he does but they have this distinct and strong corn-y taste. I miss them already.   Paul's burger was also on point. it's a HUGE patty, and inexplicably is not greasy yet still super tasty. the bun didn't get soggy at any point, not even a hint of soggy, but the flavor and texture was all there. definitely a place to check out when you're in sin city!",

Mesa Grill was my favorite place that we ate when we went to Vegas on our honymoon 2 years ago and it was just as good for brunch!    We were seated almost immediately - a pleasant surprise and ordered Bloody Mary's.  They had a kick but not too spicy.  Bread basket came out - jalepeno corn cakes, blueberry coffee cake (soooo good!), and candied berry scones.  I loved the variety in the bread basket.  Too bad we didn't think to ask if we could bring it home.   My husband had the Mesa Grill burger cooked medium (barf!) and fries and I had some egg dish that had a green chili sauce that was layered on crispy blue tortillas.  It was heavenly.    Our server seemed like he was kind of having a bad day but he was handling it like a champ and having a sense of humor about it.  He was a sport and kept our drinks refilled and food out on the table as soon as it was ready (or so it seemed).  I can't wait til next time we can go to Mesa Grill.",

Our group was very impressed by the quality of food {4 appetizers, 11 entrees, 2 sides, 6 deserts, 6 bottles of wine.} Not one person unhappy with their food. Our service was exceptional.  Since there were 11 in our party they considered us a \"group\" and wanted us to order from a limited menu. We picked Mesa Grill based on reputation and so wanted to order from the menu. The Mesa Grill staff worked with us and gave us a great experience.   I personally had a great and well aged fillet mignon with an enjoyable coffee rub. My dining partners were particularly outspoken in favor of the 22 ounce ribeye, and green chili cioppino, and pork tenderloin. A side dish of roasted corn was exceptional. A very enjoyable Willamette Valley Pinot Noir topped off the evening.",

    "text": "Bacchanal line was too long! But this was a great back-up. You get served some complimentary carbs to start--coffee cakes, jalapeno bread, blue cornbread, etc. The fresh-squeezed orange juice was delightful. Blue corn-crusted halibut was simple and great. Clean taste with a bit of a kick. Capers and grape tomatoes in the sauce. Mmm... the boy ordered goat cheese and jalapeno scrambled eggs with honey ham. The ham was very juicy and soft.  The entire meal, all my bf and I could say is \"that's interesting.\" Such an interesting mix of flavors all around, which I guess is expected of this kind of restaurant. The service was great. I think the brunch menu is rather simple, so in reality I'm giving 3.5 stars (rounding up because it was a pleasant meal all around) but I'd definitely like to try their lunch and/or dinner menu, which is probably more of an experience.",

I am a fan of Bobby Flay and his food on Food Network looks amazing, but I would never recommend this restaurant to someone visiting Vegas.  The hostess was rude when I informed her that our original group of 8 was now 10, which should have been a sign to go somewhere else to eat, but we soldiered on.  They split us up into a table for 4 and a table for 6.  The server had a thick accent and was difficult to understand.  The service was poor and the food took too long to come out.    Highlights:  bread basket- all of it was really good, especially the jalapeno bread, quesadilla was perfection ... the bacon, cheese, onions and bacon were amazing.  Everyone at the table enjoyed it.  The ribeye steak, which was off menu, was excellent.  The home fries were also good.  Low lights:  All of the egg dishes were really bland. The tiger shrimp tamale was bland and the sauce was too thin.  The mimosa was weak.  Everyone hated the hominy grits ... our table was full of Southerners, so grits have a high bar to meet and it failed miserably.  Very disappointing and truly the culinary low light of our Vegas trip.",

The bread basket could of made me full - a few kinds of unique. corn muffins and sweet breads. We started with the ahi tartare app, which was amazing. Served with a few Flay sauces and homemade tortilla chips - it was fresh, savory and creative. I orders the tuna club: thick bacon, spicy aioli, sourdough bread... Every detail was good. Hubbs got a bacon burger which he devoured and deemed one of the best burgers ever. We both loved our fries. The place was hip, our waiter was awesome and we left full, impressed and warmly tipsy. We'll be back next time we're in Vegas FOR SURE.",

And the tables are long so I couldn't even comfortably hold my husbands hand across the two person table.  The scallops were so delicious that I cut each bite small so that I could savor it longer...very good!  We were warned that the pork tenderloin was spicy but it don't even have a little tinge of burn to it.  The pork was extremely tender but the flavor was just mediocre.  The brussel sprouts that were raved about by the waitress were a lot to sweet for my taste.  The biggest disappointment though must be the drinks.  Do not waste your money on the margarita menu at all!  $14 for a margarita that doesn't even have a little kick???

We were extremely excited to go to one of your restaurants for the first time but I don't think we'll be back anytime soon.  We went for lunch and I had the barbecued ribs for an app. They tasted like something you'd find at a school's cafeteria lunch. They looked like they had been sitting under a warming light for a few hours to add insult to industry.  Next up were the \"smoked shrimp tacos.\" I wasn't aware smoked means charred/burnt. They lacked any remnant of palatable flavor. The two tortillas were quite generous of you.     The service was just as horrendous. The waiter pretty much never came by and I cleared off the table myself to make way for the food.  Lastly, another reviewer had it right about the location inside the casino. You're sitting right by the sports betting so you can hear people screaming and cheering every now again. The biggest issue for me was the cigarette smoke. It wafts in from the casino floor and make the eating experience that much more gross.  Suggestion: go to Gordon Ramsey's restaurant instead. Maybe Iron Chef's just shouldn't have restaurants and stick to the Food Channel.",

Not only did  our waiter roll his eyes at us when ee ordered water to drink, he was absent the entire time we were there. We had to flag him down! The worst part were the napkins that left white lint all over my black pants. The waiter didn't apologize or offer to bring me a lint roller!

    "text": "I am a huge Bobby Flay fan and was so happy to finally try his food firsthand.  At first, I was really turned off by the \"tex-mex\" concept and even the name \"Mesa Grill\" didn't sound too appetizing, but we took a risk... and Bobby delivered.  We came here for my husband's 27th birthday and he had a wonderful time.  SERVICE:  5 Solid Stars!  The hostesses sat our party right away even though not everyone was there.  We were immediately served water and asked if we wanted any cocktails.  I really loved our waiter.  He wasn't just polite and attentive, but he was also engaging us in wonderful conversation throughout our meal.  He talked to us about how long he had been working there, and what Bobby's like... and he knew the menu like the back of his hand.  It was like having a new friend dine with us throughout the duration of our meal.  I wish I caught his name so I can give him props!  FOOD: Bread Basket - 2 stars.  They start you off with a variety of breads.  There was a jalapeno one, another one with some blue corn in it, and a third one that I can't recall.  All were very unique, but unfortunately, I wasn't a fan.  I didn't think the bread was very soft or moist, and the flavors didn't do it for me.  Kudos for thinking outside the box though.  The butter also wasn't the soft, spreadable kind.  Blue Corn Pancake - 5 stars.  This appetizer came highly recommended by our server.  There was barbecued duck inside pancake (like a glorified taco), and a habanero chili star-anise sauce drizzled all over it.  The flavors all worked so well together to deliver an explosion of flavors in my mouth.  Spanish Chorizo Quesadilla - 4 stars.  This was larger than expected!  It is pretty filling and could easily be substituted for a meal as a filler.  Or you can split this between 2-3 people and share it as an appetizer.  It's a pretty heavy dish and hard to eat too much of.  There's a large fried egg on top of a tortilla.  Embedded in the tortilla is smoked tomato salsa, grilled green onion, and crispy artichokes.    For our entree, my husband and I shared the New Mexican Spice-Rubbed Pork Tenderloin even though I was realllly eyeing the 22 ounce bone-in Ribeye.  The waiter said the pork tenderloin was their signature dish so that's why we ordered it even though I'm not a huge fan of pork.  It wasn't until the dish arrived that we were convinced we had made the right choice!!  WOW, that was one tender, delicious, savory, melt-in-your-mouth piece of meat.  The spice rub added a bit of heat, and I can easily say this is the best piece of pork I've ever been served.  It came with a side of the most amazing tamale.  I can't even begin to describe how good it was.  You just have to try it.  5 Stars for this entire dish!!!  I sampled some of the other dishes from my friends, but the pork dish was the definite standout.  My friend ordered the lamb chops, but they tasted a bit gamey and weren't as tender as they could've been.  The pan seared Halibut was tender and flaky paired with a lovely curry spice reduction.  I'd give both these dishes 4 stars.    All in all a wonderful experience.  Glad I finally got to try one of Bobby's restaurants!",

My main course for lunch was a cold thick cut pork sandwhich that was not very good at all. Very little flavor (I was warned it was going to be cold) and nothing unique about it. The Fries however were the biggest disappointment with \"special spices just dumped over the top of them and were very cold. I would like to give another try but $50 for lunch for a local is a little steep so I might have to save for a date night someday.  Well my second chance at Mesa was not any better than the first. I had the Spicy chicken and sweet potato hash. It looked nice in presentation with an egg on top 2 bright orange circular mounds. However it was anything but spicy and very sweet. It tasted good but felt more like a desert. The bread basket was good but that was it.",

Food is not hard to find in Vegas, a place to get drinks is not hard to find, and you can even find several places to sit and talk, but why not just go to Mesa Grille and get all three?   The Mesa grill is a friendly upbeat establishment in the dreary heart of Caesar's Palace. It is a welcome sanctuary of fine dining without the explosive price tag or pomp.   The food is a down South seafood kind of thing, but it is safe seafood for the faint of stomach (no fried fish heads or anything). We started with several appetizers, but I only really remember one: the Tiger Shrimp and Roasted Garlic Tamale... wipe the drool off your keyboard. What an incredible appetizer... even the name is appetizing. My entree was the Ancho Crusted Sea Scallop, and oh my I am glad I got that. The meal had such a rich flavor and was wonderfully complimented by the Cornmeal Crusted Anaheim Chile Relleno and, believe it or not, the Roasted Brussel Sprouts with Walnuts and Pomegranates.  Insanity!  I also really enjoyed the emphasis Mesa puts on their Tequila selection. They have over 30 brands of Tequila in Blanco and Anejo styles to fit your taste, and since Tequila fits my taste it was quite a nice way to try new styles.    At least go for tequila and an app or two. At most go all out because this place has great food, wonderful service, and a light tasteful atmosphere.",

I have to say that it was a excellent choice tho!  We were running late to our reservation because our show ran a little later than we thought, and so we called to inform the restaurant we would be a little late - the lady was so nice and said that it's fine.  We get seated immediately when we arrive and are greeted very promptly with the BEST server (although I forgot her name because I went here a few months ago).  Everyone in our table ordered a beverage, but one guy decided not to, but she gave him half a glass of wine just because she didn't want him to feel left out. =]    I ordered the mahi mahi but it was ok... BUT, my bf's pork tenderloin was so good it made up for it!  Our server recommended it to be cooked medium for the best outcome, and it really was perfect!  The portions are pretty generous and definitely satisfying.  After our delicious meal, we decided to splurge and order dessert.  We were all full so we decided to share one dessert among the 4 of us. We decided that our server was pretty on-point with everything we ordered, so we decided to have her choose our dessert.  She recommended the coconut cake (which none of us really looked at) but it was the BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Even my bf's friend who doesn't even like coconut devoured that.    Excellent service, excellent food, and excellent dessert!",

    "text": "On a three-day work trip to Las Vegas, I joined my team at the Mesa Grill for lunch on the first day. It completely embodied how I feel about Vegas in general.  The walk to the restaurant through Caesar's Palace forum shops was long, twisty, and needless. Made me wonder if there were a more direct route, or the people I was with just wanted to go shopping. The walk was OK in that it did increase our appetites.  Once at Mesa, The hostess sat us down, gave us some menus, and we waited for the rest of our party to show up before being shown our table.   Our table sat a dozen comfortably as it was long enough. The waiter had give his speech twice to cover each end of the table. I was looking forward to the meal; I've seen Bobby Flay on Food Network countless times.  I started with the Gala Apple Salad (baby spinach, Maytag blue cheese, toasted pecans with a spicy orange vinaigrette). The salad was spicy, but lacked enough spinach to really enjoy it as a salad. the vinaigrette dominated everything to the point where you couldn't really taste the individual ingredients. There was too much of it. I did like the texture. I wasn't wowed.  Next up was the Mahi Mahi fish tacos. Again, the food was good. The sauce dominated. And with a serving size so big, why did I have to ask for more tortillas? When has two ever been enough?  I ordered off menu for dessert. I did enjoy the egg shaped scoops of toasted pecan ice cream.  For a meal I didn't pay for, it was good. The company was great. The service was attentive for the first 3/4 of it.  There's no way I'll be clamoring to go back anytime soon.   And all of this is how I feel about Vegas. You look forward to these things you've heard about for years. There's a lot of waiting and wondering. There glitz and super-sized overshadows everything. Without good people, it's not really that enjoyable.  Not disappointed. Just should have known better.",

    "text": "Date: June 2007 Who: 1 adult Bill: ~$85  I realized that I was subconsciously avoiding all Bobby Flay restaurants up till now. Dunno why, maybe the whole looking like a dork in the first Iron Chef deal vs. Morimoto thing but I had no desire to eat at his joints.  The wife suggested I try during my last trip it so I gave it a shot. I was pleasantly surprised. I went in without any expectations and came out a happy camper.  Everything here as flavor. Big flavor. The caesar salad has sausage bits, the creamed cauliflower is loaded with tasty, creamy, delicious cheese, and the ribeye is served with a nice spicy sauce. The duck pancake was surprisingly good. A bit heavy on the bbq sauce but the habinero gave it a nice kick.   The ribeye was also perfectly cooked. I get annoyed these days because everyone always seems to overcook my beef but they did it just right. That being said, I don't necessarily think the cut of meat or preparation was all that great. Did that make sense? They cooked it great, the sauce was great, but it didn't seem like they started with something all that great or aged it at all so the meat wasn't as tender as I would have expected. It was really good but I've had better.  I enjoyed everything and would probably take the wife here if she ever stepped foot in this land of debauchery. I thought the price was in line with other restaurants in the same class.",

    "text": "I am one of those people who couldn't care less about Bobby Flay.  But during my last visit to Las Vegas, I didn't want to go do the same old routine: eating at one buffet after another.  So I decided to look up the restaurant that has good ratings in Vegas.    Found the review on Mesa Grill and it just got me curious, I asked my hubby if he wants to try it and he said yes (he enjoys watching Bobby's Flay show on food network).  So we went.    We went for lunch, the menu was short and sweet.  My husband ordered Tiger Shrimp Taco, I ordered Salmon, my father in-laws ordered Chiile Rellenos, we also got the Goat Cheese appetizer and a Coconut Cake.    The food were wonderful, I would have to say it's one of the best meals I've ever had!  My 18 months old daughter ate 3 dishes out of the 5 (she didn't try the chille because of the spice, and she couldn't try the Tiger Shrimp Taco because her dad inhaled the entire thing so fast!).  She is a very picky eater but she loved all the food there.    I would definitely go there again.  Just have to save my pretty penny first, the food at Mesa Grill is not cheap, but you pay for the quality of the food!",

    "text": "This is a place in Vegas that lives up to the hype of the name behind it without being *too* ridiculous.  Given the Bobby Flay tag readily coupled with the mention of this place, I was sure it would be all press and no substance.  I would recommend this place for brunch.  Yeah, you'll probably be looking at roughly $30 for two people not including drinks, extras or tip but I think the atmosphere and food make up for the price.  They bring you a nice array of baked goods as the \"bread\" while you wait.  All of the egg entrees are served with grits or home fries.  I ordered the scrambled egg enchiladas (eggs, chorizo, goat cheese) and they were delicious, paired with an interesting mix of sauce to provide enough spiciness to give the dish some authenticity.  My dining partner had the ranch eggs tostada which was surprisingly large and equally as tasty.  The grits were a little heavy but so tasty that I couldn't avoid eating them.  Probably the only knock is that the drinks are kind of expensive (11.2oz bottle of Chimay Blue = $12) and our waitress seemed a little condescending when we told her we didn't want appetizers.  Otherwise the service was actually quite good with the waiters being right on top of refilling waters and coffee.  Given the prices you pay in Vegas, I think you could do a lot worse on price and food quality, making Mesa a pretty solid choice for any meal.",

    "text": "A great dining experience but not the best Vegas has to offer in the grill category. I confess that me and my friend were seduced by the star name on the name to make reservations here for dinner but although it artificially raises its prices because of a vague association to Bobby Flay its dishes retain the famous chef's signature style. Which basically means that they are slightly spicier and over-sauced than you'll probably find at home.   Price was MESA is \"spendy\" but not ridiculous like some of Caesar's other offerings (Ie. Homestead Steakhouse). The ambiance is trendy and upbeat;  I was actually surprised by how bright and colorful the decoration inside was. For dinner we had a decent bottle of burgundy for about $90-100 and:  Rough Cut Tuna Nachos ($16) Lobster Tacos ($20) Roasted Veal Chop ($48) Chile Crusted Rabbit ($38) Collard Greens and Sauteed Spinach ($9 each) The whole dinner came to around  $300 but it would have been closer to $200 (with tax and tip) were it not for the bottle of wine. For me the highlight of the dinner was the Rabbit which is perfectly seasoned and prepared in 2 distinct styles. My friend enjoyed his entree and desert as well but we both found the side dishes disappointing. They were bland and the collard greens did not taste at all fresh. However the side dishes are unnecessary I think: the entrees all come with some vegetables and the serving of rabbit in particular is too big for one person. I could only get through 2/3 of it before surrendering.   A final somewhat strange note: The hosts like to arrange the seating so that people who are dressed similarly are next to each other. This leads to the restaurant divided into several clusters: 1) filled with men in Hawaiian shirts and polos, 2) trendy ladies in cocktail dresses, 3) those dressed to impress and those elderly gentlemen with young trophy wives. In a way it's nice because no matter how you dress you shouldn't feel comfortable because the people around you will probably be dressed in a similar style.",

I decided to have my birthday dinner her with knowing that this was as close to Bobby Flay as I would get.  The atmosphere is nice because you can see the kitchen in action and the overall place is huge!  The staff here is a bit on the snobby side I have to admit.  I slipped twice across the restaurant floor and no one even stopped to see if I was ok.  Talk about a law suit waiting to happen.  The food here was ok.  My mouth always salivates when I watch Iron Chef or any one of his hundreds of shows.  I even saw Mesa's grand opening on the Food Network.  Unfortunately, this place just didn't meet my expectations and doubt that I will ever go back only because the food did not have me wanting to crawl (off the floor) for more.  We ordered a three course meal and could not recommend any of the dishes that I ordered since they weren't that memorable.  The taco appetizer was good, but not OMG good.    TIP: Don't believe the hype.  Skip it.",

Mesa Grill was on my radar before arriving in LV so my boyfriend and I decided to make reservations for dinner at around 9:30P on a Friday evening. I'm sure there's SOME room for walk-ins, but I would definitely make reservations in advance if you're planning on going during prime dinner hours.   Bobby Flay really put together an incredible menu from start to finish. We started out with the roasted tiger shrimp + corn tamale which kicked off the meal perfectly. All the flavors in the dish just worked together perfectly. We opted to nab two sides instead of a second appetizer and decided on the roasted corn and the cornmeal-crusted chile relleno to go with our entrees. The corn could quite possibly be one of my favorite foods ever -- beyond delicious and seriously a MUST if you're ordering a side. The chile was great, though didn't quite have the same impact. Being a pescetarian, the tuna steak was a pretty natural entree selection for me and it couldn't have been a better choice. A surprisingly big portion and all-around amazing plate. I should say though that we had entirely too much food. We could have JUST had our entrees and I would have been satisfied. One app + two entrees for two people is probably enough unless you're particularly hungry. By the end of the meal I was at the point where I was beyond full but couldn't seem to stop munching because it was SO good! Dessert wasn't even an option for us after over-ordering. When you pop in keep in mind that the portions are actually pretty good-sized (which is a pleasant surprise) and order accordingly. All around amazing. I would definitely come back again next time I'm in Vegas!",

So much so I didn't even want to take a bite! A relatively small portion for 45 bucks...but that I didn't mind so much compared to the tough, chewy lobster on soggy masa cakes. Yuck!

The chile relleno didn't leave me wanting for more and the tamale was rubbery and I didn't finish it.   Other than that, the restaurant had a hip ambience, but wasn't too noisy that you were hoarse from talking loud or couldn't hear what your tablemate was saying.  Again, I may have been more impressed if I ordered a \"real\" dinner, but hey, shouldn't I be impressed even with appetizers and side dishes if it is a good restaurant?

    "text": "This was my third luncheon visit to MESA which is a restaurant I have been smitten with in the past. Twice before I had the pork tenderloin sandwich with french fries and I have recommended it to friends who have also raved. Thus, six months later I returned with friends and ordered a pork tenderloin sandwich. The waiter got busy and I could see the food in the window so long that they took the fries away and replaced them with another batch. Eventually, other waiters brought our food to us. The sandwich was good but the portion of pork seemed smaller and the fries were not as good as I remember. Honestly, I may be splitting hairs but I truly believe that the care and attention to detail in the front and back of the house has declined. With so many options in LV and even at Caesars, I will think twice before returning. Bobby are you listening? I'm a former restaurant professional, extreme foodie and a big fan!",

    "text": "i have nothing bad to say about this restaurant, highlight of my foodie experiences in vegas. we started off with the goat cheese queso fundido, which was somewhat greasy but so warm and creamy with the blue corn tortilla chips. i ordered the white peach margarita, which is the perfect \"girly\" drink - sweet and fruity, just to my liking! now for the entrees. our waiter recommended the new mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin, which comes with a sweet potato tamale. i don't even like pork, and this was amazing. so much flavor, and the pork was cooked to perfection! we also had the cornmeal crusted chile relleno, filled with roasted eggplant and cheese. a different take on your classic chile relleno, mine was a bit salty but still yummy. we ordered the double baked potato as a side item, creamy with a kick from the horseradish on top.  unfortunately, we were too full by the end of the meal to order any dessert. but our experience here was wonderful! our waiter was helpful, ambience was trendy, and food was superb. only other tip to add: please make a reservation before you come here, it's a popular restaurant!",

When we were seated for dinner we all couldn't help but feel like we were an irritation to our server.  After all we were seated for a 10 pm dinner, James, the server, if you don't want serve people than don't work the dinner shift.  When he came over to take our orders, he didn't even bother to find out what we wanted to drink, he just took our entree orders.  When our food came out it was alright.  But I think our experience there was definitely affected by our mediocre service.",

    "text": "As one can tell based on the high ratings of others reviewers this place is good. Real good. I've only been here twice, but the fact that I went back at all considering the fact that there are so many restaurants in Vegas to still try is something. My first time here I was pleasantly surprised. I like things simple. real simple, so when I saw the menu I freaked. This place is not simple. But I am getting ahead of myself here. Lets talk about walking in. My little brother and are look the same age despite the 4 years age difference, we look 17. SO imagine the look of disdain of the hostess seeing who their 9 pm reservation was for. We were told to wait (stand by the door) for 15 minutes with reservation at 9pm. Then we were led to a complete bs table. We ordered drinks. I was still under 21 order roy rogers ya just get me my drink and be gone. They thought we were cheap, and then we ordered. My brother had the duck pancake, I had the ahi tuna... appetizers. We split a salad... veggies. He had the coffee glazed steak, I had the pork tenderloin something.... main course. I had coffee, he had espresso... warm up. He had something delish for dessert and I had small scoop of ice cream... I was full.   The bill was close to 3, without tip. do not ever underestimate age. I gave a fatty tip... yes our parents paid but still.   I like this place. Even though we were dressed slummy and we looked young the waiter was kind enough to answer all of my questions. (simple food gal)  The food was spectacular and made me think of nothing else for the next three months till we were back. My second time here was still good, but something went awry. I got deathly sick later that night. So sick that I cannot even bear to go back.  But still I have fond memories of this place.",

No complaints regarding the food. My only little complaint is about the temperature of the restaurant,, it is freezing in there.  The nice touch is that they will bring you a wrap to wear while dining.  Our waiter said this is a frequent request.  While it's nice that they provide the wrap, why not just turn the air conditioning down a bit.  I needed booties too, in sandals my feet were freezing. Great food, service but bring a coat.",

We have been hitting the usual places that we always go to when we visit Las Vegas (Sushi Samba, Julian Serrano Tapas) and a few new places (Sage, Central by Michel Richard) to name a few. We asked for a table for 2 as we walked in.  The hostess plainly informed us that I need to take off my hat to be able to seat in the dining area.  I was taken aback since we have been dining in much more upscale places and never was asked to take my hat off.  MInd you this was late afternoon not dinner time.  I asked what was the dress code and the hostess informed me that it was casual.  As I looked around to the 4 or 5 occupied tables, the majority of the clientele was wearing t-shirts, shorts and slippers.  I was informed that those were casual wear but not a hat and the restaurant is trying to keep their high standards.  I was stunned by the pretentiousness that was permeating infront of me.  So I took my hat off and proceeded to our table hoping that the food would put me in a better mood.  The server was trying so hard to suggest several dishes and we accepted some of his suggestions.  The appetizer was good but too bad we can not enjoy this since the main dishes arrive as we took our first bite.  The servers then slammed the rest of the food in our small table and left.  The rest of the dishes were mediocre, bland (salt & pepper anyone?) and pedestrian.  Over all I felt like I went to a chain restaurant like Chevy's or CPK and was insulted and served avarage food.  Too bad.",

I know for sure both of us had the filet with the coffee rub, and I remember thinking it was good but I wish it wasn't coffee.  Don't get me wrong, it was good quality cow, and it was cooked well, I just personally thought the flavor combo was a little strange (but I'm not a coffee drinker either).  And unfortunately mom won't try anything even resembling seafood and I'm not into mexican/tex-mex/southwestern much, so that doesn't help.  Other than that, I like the overall layout of the restaurant, though it was MUCH smaller than I thought it would be.  It was a good thing we opted for an early dinner that night, because they had a line all the way out the slot machines by the time we left.  I liked how you could see the action of the kitchen, but we weren't close enough for me to get a detailed view.  And it was a pleasant place to dine with good service.  So I'd go back and give it another shot, maybe try some of the grilled seafood or yummy sounding appetizers",

Thought about the pork tenderloins but got talked out of them by the waiter so I ordered the ribeye. I love a good ribeye; one of my top favorite foods. This was the worst ribeye...actually the worst piece of meat I've ever eaten. Totally undercooked (and I like a good piece of rare meat) and worse: absolutely no flavor. I enjoy the fat on a ribeye but this had way more fat than usual. The honey glaze and the other sauces were okay, but I wasn't even interested in the meat. Service was slow (which was fine, we weren't in a hurry at first) but by the time I bit into that meat I was ready to leave. I didn't bother complaining to my waiter because I knew it would take too long to bring out something else and by that time we were ready to get back to the craps table. Found it interesting that the waiter didn't ask if something was wrong when he cleared my plate and there were only 2 bites taken out. Maybe I hit this place on an off night but I don't think I'd be willing to go again to find out. Too many other good places to eat in Vegas. Skip this one.",

The apps were all great, I had pan seared scallops as mine, and got Veal for my entree , truly melted in my mouth. the side dish was i guess the standard for the restaurant as everyone at the table ,whether they had seafood,beef, or chicken got the same breaded corn tamale thing, which tasted ok but i think we should have been given the chance to mix it up, wasn't really an option on the menu. The dessert was very good as well dont remember what it was called because i was being adventurous but tempura bananas figured very heavily into the equation. The only other  turn off besides the all for one side dish was our waiter who was kind of creepy, he wasnt rude or anything but was really prissy and like the nerdy scientist from the simpsons  (ahem mmm yess)as he spoke all nasally to you. haha sorry im being rude now.",

Both were good but I actually really liked the Raw tuna nachos and the Pork tenderloin even better. I also recommend the cilantro mashed potatoes. The only thing we had that wasn't so great and was seriously gross was the tequila ice cream. I love tequila, so I was pretty open to this, but all I can say is \"Yuck\"!  Anyway, we were there for quite a while (I think we actually closed the place) and the wait staff was great. There was a pretty extensive wine list, so naturally we had to have a few bottles, and when we needed a pointer on a bottle our waiter was really cool and helpful. This was a nice evening with great food and wine and I was relieved to find out that the Southwestern influence on cooking far exceeds the Southwestern influence on interior decorating.",

    "text": "I am not a big fan of tex mex food but Mesa Grill reflects the creativity in Bobby Flay which i guess, makes Bobby Flays food different from the norm.  I have to admit, even though im not a big fan of Bobby Flay himself, his use of big flavors and for some reason vibrant colors with his southwestern flare does indeed comfirm his bold and cocky style.  Mesa Grill did not dissapoint, but anyways, ill jus cut to the chase, this is what i tasted  goat cheese queso fundido- probably not so good if you dont like the taste of heavy nutty cheeses, very strong goat cheese flavor raw tuna nachos- famous dish, the mango and avocado sauce is a good combo pork loin sandwhich- the ancho chile mayo is spicy, actually not so bad, pretty tasty, the arugula and chiabatta bread complements it well, its served cold but for some reason, i think it would taste better hot mesa burger- a decent burger, served with seasoned fries spicy chicken sweet potatoe hash- probably the best taste, sweet potatoes with eggs and hollandaise, did not taste as heavy as i thought, notbad honey glazed salmon and the new york strip- not great, not bad, nothing very special, or i guess wats special was the bbq sauces they use for the meats, didnt really ruin the flavors of the meats another thing was i heard mesa is famous for their breads, i was lookin for to the famous corn bread, but it was dry and it was cold, it seemed like it always broke apart and didnt hold together well, but the little jalopeno biscuits were good  3.5 stars",

My server was incredibly nice, helpful and thoughtful. I started with the tuna and salmon tartar. It was ok - tasted fresh and The spicy cilantro sauce was good but I've certainly had better ahi. Then, on my servers recommendation, I ordered the Filet with mushroom black pepper and red wine reduction. I planned on ordering something more \"Bobby\" with chipotle and the like, but I'm glad I didn't. The filet was fantastic. Perfectly cooked, wonderful flavor, overall extremely good. I also ordered the grilled corn, and must say it was one of the best side dishes ive ever had. Really. Sweet, spicy, crunchy and velvety all in each bite. Wow. I finished things off with cinnamon sugar churros and star anise chocolate dipping sauce. The churros were crisp on the outside and soft on the I side. The star anise in the sauce is interesting, certainly adds interesting depth to the chocolate. So... This was not a cheap meal, but it was one if the better meals I've eaten and I would certainly go back. I would have given it a perfect five if not for the ahi.",

    "text": "Reserved via Open Table for dinner with my husband while in Vegas for the weekend for our wedding anniversary. It was Friday night but we got seated pretty quickly even though we were about 5 minutes late due to a bit of a miscalculation on our flight arrival time. Place was busy but they were definitely moving people in & out pretty quickly.   We choose this place because we wanted to experience a Bobby Flay restaurant after seeing so much of him on The Food Network. We weren't disappointed!  Their bread basket had a nice cheese bread, corn muffin & a walnut raisin bread. All were good, but our favorite was the cheese bread with peppers. We then started out with these mini (& I do mean mini!!!) blue corn lobster tacos for an appetizer. After laughing about the size (maybe 2\"x1\" tacos) we split the 3 tacos. We weren't laughing then!  We were licking our fingers!  Very delicious.  One of our servers was joking with us about how they had tastings of them when the tacos were introduced & they all had the same complaint... They wanted more!  We agreed, yummy!  Then we ordered the Ancho Chile Honey Glazed Salmon & grilled chicken to share. We honestly thought we'd like the salmon better, but both really liked the spicy tangy sauce on the chicken. Plus it had this yummy corn tamale on the side. Salmon was good & was cooked very well, but I guess we just thought it was not especially different tasting than what we could get somewhere else. Strangely enough, it was our side dish of Roasted Corn that we liked the most!  What a burst of flavor from the aioli & cheese on it!  At first I wasn't sure I'd be able to finish it because I wanted to save room for dessert, but I couldn't resist because it was great.   But the absolute best part of the meal (it had us talking about it all weekend long!) was the Sticky Toffee Pudding!  OMG!!! It's sweet, yet salty, sticky but not too much & the texture of the cake/pudding was firm but moist. Sooooo good!  I didn't have any of the vanilla ice cream it was served with cuz I'm lactose intolerant, but my hubby said it was not really anything special. But he ate it anyway!    Overall, the food was great, the servers really were on top of everything & very friendly. Not at all snooty or aloof.  Had a great time & would do it again...especially the dessert!",

The goat cheese queso fundido was recommended by the waiter; it was chunky cheese that was halfway cold by the time it got to our table.  I ordered Bass.  It was so soggy, almost inedible.  AndI couldn't believe that the food at Bobby Flay's restaurant was BLAND?!?!  So odd!  The after-dinner cocktails were super, super strong.  I like to drink, but I don't usually do pulls of Hawkeye Vodka on the rocks, and that's what it tasted like to me!  I would try another restaurant; there are plenty of them on the strip!",

Of course I went sans my sons. Gave them McDs money and strolled in right before the lunch crowd hit. I dropped a star because the hostess immediately asked if I wanted to be seated at the bar.  I declined but she only offered me a table closely arranged to other tables with couples and groups. I asked for a table somewhere else where I wouldn't feel like I was a third wheel but the hostess claimed nothing else was available.  So I settled for the bar, the bartenders were very nice and offered suggestions of the white peach margarita. It was very nice and strong-should be for $13. I had the BBQ lamb Cobb salad which was flavorful and filling except for the lamb all ingredients were routine. Finally the banana cream pie was delicious, light creamy with fresh bananas, custard,whip cream topped with a delectable toffee crisp cookie.  I hope Mr Flay opens a restaurant in northern California somewhere, Napa maybe?",

I was very excited to try Mesa Grill during a business trip to Vegas.  Sadly, it was a terrible experience due to Mr. Flay's arrogance.  I asked our waitress if she could recommend a menu item that could be easily modified for a vegan diet and she said .... in the kindest way possible that \"Mr. Flay does not modify his food for any special diet - he says you must eat it as it comes.\"  Excuse me, but I'm not at the French Laundry, and Bobby Flay is not Thomas Keller, so if I want a damn meal of plants I should be able to get it.  Fortunately there was a salad easily modified to leave off the cheese and it was quite delicious.  My coworkers enjoyed their steaks and scallops and the margaritas were decent.  It was just such an off-putting experience to feel like I wasn't welcomed at this restaurant - we won't be back.",

My mom took me for my birthday present while we were in town because I love Bobby Flay (one of my favorite Food Network chefs). We were a bit early for our reservations so we had to wait a few minutes, but we ordered drinks while we waited. Such delicious margaritas! The appetizers we got (the duck pancake and goat cheese dip) were delicious ways to start the meal. I got the halibut and my mom got the pork tenderloin. Both were amazing! We were not going to get dessert but we were intrigued by the spicy peanut butter ice cream on the chocolate pretzel tart. So glad we got that, it was delicious.  I definitely want to go back the next time I am in Vegas!",

The restaurant is warm and inviting with color. They will ask gentlemen to remove their ballcaps (as well you should) and seat you promptly. The waitstaff are clearly in this for a career and it shows in their manner and care. The complimentary bread basket is amazing but the food...wow. We ordered the tamale, goat cheese queso and Mesa burger. Easily a top 5 dining experience that we can't wait to enjoy again.",

    "text": "The wife and I were in Vegas for a few days, and we always enjoy indulging in some of their great restaurants when we visit.  We had both been to Mesa Grill once before for lunch, but we decided to visit for dinner this time around.  For anyone that doesn't know, Mesa Grill is one of Bobby Flay's restaurants, and is located inside the Caesar's Palace Hotel.    We made a reservation for 8:15, and the place was hopping when we arrived.  Living in St. Louis, I'm not used to restaurants being packed at this time, but this is par for the course in Vegas.  We were seated quickly after we arrived, more towards the back of the restaurant.  The table we had was pretty small, and was close to a few other tables.  It wasn't bad, but you could tell they were trying to get as many tables in there as possible.  I don't blame them, but I'm just stating how things are set up.  The food here is more of a southwestern/mexican style.  They offer several different appetizers and salads, but we decided to skip out on these. They do bring out some bread, which includes a cheesy type with a hint of jalapeno, corn muffins, and wheat bread.  The bread was outstanding.  I could have eaten several pieces, but I didn't want to get too full.  For our meals, I ordered the veal chop, while my wife ordered the tuna steak.  Mine came with a blue cheese type of tamale.  I thought everything was great.  Lots of flavor in every bite.  I tried my wife's food and hers was excellent as well.  We decided to order dessert, and got a pumpkin pie type of dessert.  It had caramel on top, and it was excellent.  Overall, I thought Mesa Grill was a great choice for dinner in Vegas.  I've been to a few of Bobby Flay's restaurants, and have been impressed each time.  Dinner for two here will cost you around $100.  I'm sure we'll be back here at some point.",

This is our third time to Mesa Grille, and we love that they change up the menu from time to time. We also love the bread basket, specifically the blue corn muffins!   Today, I decided to try Sophie's Chopped Salad .. it was okay .. not bad, not great .. just okay. Nothing I would order again though.   Mom had the Blue Corn Pancake with BBQ duck .. which she enjoyed and said was tasty. She still likes the Tiger Shrimp Tamales the best though.   I opted to try the Smoked Shrimp Tacos which were delicious. Just the right amount of smokiness and just the right size for lunch. (Six nice-sized and perfectly seasoned shrimp and two tortillas.) I would have to say I will have a tough time deciding between this dish and the signature Shrimp Tamales the next time we come.   For dessert we decided to share the Sticky Toffee Pudding .. which is one of my all time favorite desserts. Unfortunately this one fell way short. It smelled right, and looked right, but the taste was not right. The pudding part was kind of dry and tasteless and the sauce was overly sweet. A disappointing end to an otherwise great lunch.",

I was impressed with the wine list and enjoyed a Pinot...but mom took a recommendation and ordered a house Margarita.  She was not disappointed.

Mom ordered an over the top New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin - even though I was loving my selection...I was envious of her's as well.

Also the bread basket is YUMMY! Sour dough, tomato  and Corn bread oh my! Todo we are deeeefinately not in Kansas anymore!    Just one word to the wise... This is not your typical \"Tex Mex\" restaurant. Sure i SUPPOSE it does have Mexican flavors and some Texan influence. But, you will not be getting refried beans, chili con queso and 5 dollars nachos.  After all people.. This is a Bobby Flay dining experience and he would NEVER allow such typical dishes that lack innovation.   In short, yessss i am a fan. My favorite restaurant in the world? No... But still one i go back to over and over again. If you are a foodie, this is 100 percent worth at least a meal or two.",

Poached eggs, grilled chicken, cubed sweet potatoes, bell peppers, salsa and green chile hollandaise was insane.   It came with their complimentary bread basket medley, which is divinity in a basket. By now your taste buds are working full throttle. The raspberry coffee crumb cake squares were my fav, but the jalapeno cornbread muffins and tequila berry scones were all delicious!",

    "text": "My husband and I had lunch at Mesa Grill last week and we loved it!  I started with a Cactus Pear margarita.  It was a beautiful color and tasted great.  We got an appetizer of the Tiger Shrimp & Garlic Corn Tamale.  It was awesome!  We could have eaten several more.  The sweet corn is so tasty and the sauce is incredible.  For our entrees, we split the Chile Relleno and the Spicy Chicken & Sweet Potato Hash.  Both were very good.  The chile Relleno covering was crunchier than I am used to, but all the tastes blended well and the cheese just melted.  The hash was very different, but quite tasty.  It was pieces of chicken and sweet potatoes basically mashed into wash other and covered by eggs and hollandaise sauce.  I was a big fan of both dishes.    I couldn't resist dessert even though I really had no room.  We had the Layered Coconut Cake.  Scrumptious!  I would describe it as a tiramisu with coconut flavor, rather than a coffee-like flavor.  The cakes were soaked in some kind of cream like a tiramisu. It was great!",

    "text": "In a word, bummer.  I had high hopes but mixed feelings about eating here. I love Bobby Flay and have always wanted to eat at his restaurants. So when I learned I would be vacationing in Vegas, I knew this place was a must but after reading the reviews on Yelp, I was skeptical.  And I had every right to be.   We went in early in the afternoon, around 1:30pm. First of all, when we got to the Forum Shops/Caesars Palace we weren't sure where to go. We checked the directory and Mesa wasn't on it! So we asked a girl at a gellato stand. She directed us to go all the way down to the bottom of the Forum Shops. When we made our way there, we still couldn't find it and had a man tell us we had to go all the way back! Frusterated, we went outside and walked to the front of Caesers, went inside and finally found it. But when we finished and took a left, we walked right into the Forum Shops where we first started out, right by the gellato stand where we got directions the first time! I don't know if she wasn't educated on the layout or simply was tired of having people ask for directions and sent us on a wild goose chase. Either way, it was very frustering.  As for the actual restaurant, we were seated right away. Like previous reviews, the seating/tables are very close to each other, I'm sure so they can pack in as many diners as possible.   Service was okay, nothing to write home about.   Now, the food......oh, the food. I ordered the famous Pork Tenderloin sandwich, as I LOVE spicy food and the server told us it was probably the spiciest dish on the menu. Um, really? It had almost NO spice, and really no flavor whatsoever. The fries were overdone and just not very good. My boyfriend ordered the burger, which was WAY better than what I ordered and I ended up finishing it for him. He also was not impressed with the fries.  Before I forget, the bread basket was very disappointing. I was looking forward to the jalapeno bread and it was soggy and not spicy even though I could see the bits of jalapeno in it. The rest of the bread was also meh.   Overall, I'm glad I had the experiance but I won't be back to Mesa Grill. Sorry, Bobby.",

Every time I go to Vegas I make sure to eat at least one dinner at the Mesa Grill.  My go-to dish is the coffee rubbed filet mignon.  As usual, it was perfectly prepared and was so tender you could cut it with a fork. The seasoning was also perfectly applied.  I have his cook book and can approximate the seasoning, but it isnt as good as the real thing.  I had the roasted corn as a side dish for the first time and I could have eaten it as a meal in itself.  It was delicious.  Working my way backwards, I had the blue corn pancake as an appetizer.  The duck was delicious in the chili sauce, I only wish it was a little bigger.  Overall, it was a great meal.  I'll be back next time I'm in Vegas.",

The hostesses were very nice because I had to change my reservation time and number of our party about 3 times but they didnt give me a hassle and were most gracious every time. They were the best part of this restaurant.   We were sat right in front of the main kitchen which was nice to see them grillin and cookin. We were given ONE small basket of breads, muffins and cakes since it was lunch time. For a party of 9, I didnt think it was enough but we just shared. The jalapeno biscuits were the best item in the basket.  The food: One common ingredient throughout....SPICE! I ordered the pumpkin soup which had great flavor, but was spicy with pepper and cumin. Good, but too much spice for me.  Most of us ordered the Mesa burger which was, nothing special. It was large but thats it. They serve it with a horseradish mustard which I dont like but pretty much other than that there was a piece of lettuce in it.  The fries that come with it were completely overly spiced up. I couldnt even see the fries! Gross man, it was like eating a jar of mixed spice. Yuck. Two others got the Salmon and it was just okay.   Then the biggest flop by Bobby Flay ever. The pineapple upside down cake was so gross I had to force myself to swallow it. Im so sorry but pepper does not belong in this dessert. This guys spices everything but not in a good way. We also ordered the chocolate cake dessert and it was not that great.   I wouldnt recommend this restaurant with all the other choices in Vegas.",

We asked of course, if Bobby Flay was working that night and he was!  We got to take pics and stuff with him which was cool and she sat us near the kitchen so we could watch him make our food.  I had the 16 spiced duck breast and a goat cheese/artichoke dip appetizer which was absolutely amazing.  Do not go to vegas and not check this place out. Incredible",

They were only serving their dinner menu, which looked delicious so it was perfect.  We started off with a prickly pear margaritta and a white peach margaritta, the peach one was delicious and not to sweet,and my huband enjoyed his pear drink too.  We decided to order a couple appetizers for our meal.  We had the lobster tacos, duck pancakes, goat cheese queso, and mashed potatoes.  The goat cheese queso was AMAZING so delicious and gooey.  They are served with chips, but I also put some on the bread that was delivered to the table.  It was really a great dish.  I was really disapointed my the lobster tacos, first they are one bit, literally.  At least you get 3 but still for $15 I wanted more than 3 bites.  Also, I couldnt taste the lobster, there was way too much going on in that little taco!  The duck pancake was very flavorful and the sauce was delicious.  It was a think pancakes, more like a crepe and there was plenty of duck.  The mashed potatoes were to die for!  They put a queso sauce over them they makes them sooo tasty.  Very wonderful lunch with great service!  p.s the bread basket had some of the best bread I have ever had!",

    "text": "I really liked Mesa Grill.  Yes, I went here because of Bobby Flay.  No, I don't think he's pretentious (but maybe he is, I've never met him :P).  They first brought out some breads -- blueberry spice muffin of some sort, jalapeno corn bread, fruit scone, coffee cake.  I was surprised that it wasn't just regular bread and butter but I liked it more!  Jalapeno corn bread was a bit bland though so it could use a little something.  The blueberry spice muffin thing was a bit strange.  The coffee cake was pretty good!  To drink, I got the cactus pear iced tea.  The waiter wasn't hesitant to recommend this one, and I'm really glad I got it.  Tastes mainly just like iced tea but has a subtler sweetness from the pear, though I have to admit I didn't taste the \"cactus.\"  They also brought out liquid sugar and knowing how much I love sugary iced tea, this was ideal!  Free refills too :).  Next, I got the pork tenderloin sandwich with Southwestern mesquite fries.  The pork wasn't pulled pork (don't know why I expected that), but it was juicy and tender (not dry at all) and had a good kick of a spice to it!  Bread was grilled panini-style and the sandwich was really good!  The fries were well-seasoned but still needed ketchup.  Ended with a chocolate corn bread pudding and it tasted pretty good, good amount of spongey-ness to the corn bread pudding and was drenched in some chocolatey sauce, though I have to say I think I tasted a bit of cheesiness to the sauces (like a cheesecake thing) and I didn't like that too much since I don't like cheesecake, but maybe that was just me.  I didn't finish most of my fries and didn't finish half my sandwich and had to force myself to eat the dessert and I was sooo full.  It's pretty pricey for a sandwich and fries ($16) and dessert ($11) but I'm really glad I went.  Definitely more affordable for brunch than dinner.",

The food is delish, although the prices are a bit steep!    For starters, we've tried the bacon & hash brown enchilada and their tiger shrimp and roasted corn tamale.  I'm not a big fan of enchiladas, but this one is pretty good to eat...comes with an egg on top as well.  The tamales are bomb, but man, they need like 2-3 more shrimps on there!    I love their Pork Tenderloin sandwich.  The pork is served cold and comes on a ciabatta like bun with arugula and some ancho chile mayo sauce.  On the side, you have these great southwestern french fries that compliments the sandwich just perfect. As much as I love this place, sometimes when I get the sandwich, the fries are hit and miss.  The last time I was there, there were almost rock hard.    My hubby gets the Mesa Burger from time to time and says it's really good.  It's a big burger and be ready to get dirty cause it looks a lil messy to eat!    For dinner, we've also had the steak, chicken and duck plate, I believe it was.  Again, all that we've tried have been really good!    Oh, how I crave the pork tenderloin sandwich now! :)",

The New York Strip is by far the best entree I've ever had in my entire life. Cooked to absolute perfection (medium, exactly how I asked for it) and crusted with little bits of heaven (a multi-pepper ground crust I believe) I sliced it as thin as thin as I could so I could enjoy it as long as possible to the dismay of my now wife. It came with a roasted red pepper sauce that must have been the best sauce I've ever had to accompany steak.  Maybe someone slipped me some ecstasy before I walked in the door, but this place transcended the steak for me into a magical experience I'll never forget.  What's unfortunate is that I'll never order anything else when I return (which I've done since, and it was just as magical.)",

So yes, we did have to have a reservation because if we didn't we would be amongst the many hungry smoke stenched patrons waiting to be seated. But it was worth it!!  For starters, we had cocktails at the bar. The bar menu didn't list all their beers, just the imported foo-foo ones which had my husband scratching his head until the bartender told him the domestic beers weren't listed but they do serve them. I started off with their hot-pink cactus-pear margarita...it was fresh, tangy and just mouth-watering! Could I say, THEE best margarita I've ever tasted? I proceeded to throw back two more during dinner.  Appetizers: Yucatan Chicken Tacos - Absolutely delicious! The Peanut-Smoked Chile Barbecue Sauce was reminiscent of Pad Thai Sauce...after the tacos were done, my husband sopped up the remaining sauce with the YUMMY dinner rolls...Overall, I highly recommend you try them!  Our waiter was awesome! The customer service at MESA was just as good as the food. I had on a black dress and the server returned back with a black napkin so the white fibers wouldn't get on my dress (I mean really? This ol' thang?!). He did the same for my husband as well. It was a fairly busy Saturday night and he made sure he was readily available to us. Huge Plus for me :)  Dinner Entrees: I have been dying to try their pork tenderloin since I had seen so many reviews gushing about them. I don't usually eat pork so I chickened out at the last second and got the Southwestern Spiced Duck Breast. Once again, I fell in love with the sauce, Carrot-Habanero Sauce. It complimented the meat beautifully! There was a side of the Chorizo-Goat Cheese Tamale and it melted in my mouth. The dish was awesome....however, halfway through the dish...my husband and I split...to truly appreciate the dishes :) As soon as I tasted the Pork Tenderloin, I felt an orgasm in my mouth. I kid you not. That dish was as perfect as it could get.  Dessert: We were so full after that but my taste buds couldn't get enough. We ordered dessert to get the full experience. We ordered the Cafe con Leche Flan (Espresso Caramel) and it was so light and perfectly sweet. A calm ending to an overall amazing dinner.  MUSTS: - Cactus-Pear Margarita - Yucatan Chicken Tacos - New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin  BUSTS: - Wow...none huh? I was in heaven...MESA is the reason I created a yelp ha",

    "text": "I went to Vegas last weekend with my little sister for her 21st. She had never been to a fine dining restaurant, so we decided to go to Mesa. We weren't starving, so we skipped the prix fixe menu and just ordered one entree each.   My sister ordered the salmon. I saw the disappointment on her face when her plate was placed in front of her. The plate consisted of a very small piece of salmon without accompaniments. I expected a micro green salad or puree since it was one of the more expensive entrees on the menu, but it was just a lone piece of salmon. The salmon was good, but not worth the price.  My entree was a different story. I ordered the chile relleno and I give it four stars. The chile was large; filled with cheese and eggplant; and covered in a nice, crunchy corn batter. It was pretty satisfying.  I recommend going to Mesa only if you plan on ordering the prix fixe menu, because it wont be such a let down if one of your dishes doesn't shine like it should.  I still feel bad that my sister's first fine dining experience was such a let down. Chef Flay should put more thought into ALL of the items on his menu. I felt like the salmon was hastily created and was not worth the money that my sister paid.",

I have to hand it to Bobby for his innovative dishes such as The Blue Corn Pancake which is served with barbecued duck in a habanero sauce to his Blue Corn Crusted Squid.  The sauces are very nice on the palate.  The New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin did not come out hot although overcooked; you would expect more from a dish with a bourbon ancho sauce.  Perhaps if Bobby were in the kitchen the dishes would have impressed.  The Chipotle Glazed Rib-Eye was good although I wish it were a bit rarer.  The desserts are definitely a must try with the Warm Chocolate Cake with dulce de leche or the Warm Cornbread Pudding.  The mixed drinks were nice although a bit on the weak side.    The style and decor was nicely done with a view of the casino floor in the distance.  I would recommend having your hotel make a reservation for you should you decide to grab lunch or dinner at this popular destination.  The service can be a bit slow and the staff pretentious, but overall a nice experience.  Hopefully you won at the tables or the slots as you're bill is bound to put a crimp in your gambling.",

Thee tuna and salmon tartar, the burgers, the blue cheese salad, the spicy chicken hash - all were to die for. The fries (humble though they may usually be) were fantastic. The bread basket alone was worth coming for - although we were so stuffed on the muffins and the blueberry walnut squares and the jalapeno cheese bites that we couldn't eat dessert, which I am still sad about.",

    "text": "Wow. This place is out of control. I ordered the tuna steak. It had some couscous on it and a green sauce.  The tuna was perfectly seared, and all of the flavors worked really well.  I also ordered a pear and cactus margarita after watching the bar keep make one, and a vodka press, cuz that's what I drink.  I was surprised at how well the margarita tasted since I don't normally do tequila. I know, how ironic. And the vodka press is pretty hard to make not taste good.    I did have to make reservations, but the wait wasn't very long so I was fine with that.  And I was given the option to sit at the bar or lounge for a full menu if something opened up before my rsvp time.  So I sat at the bar.  The bartender was pretty cool, and the food came out pretty quick which was surprising considering how packed the place was.    In conclusion, I recommend this restaurant to everyone who likes to eat good tasting food, and drink drinks made just right.  The prices are a little high, but then again, it's pretty much the going rate for a quality eatery in this godforsaken town.  Also, I hear Bobby Flay likes to go in on occasion to help out the pastry chef.  Chances are you likely won't see him there, but I hear this place is a gambling town so you never know...",

Plus we had to wait extra for a bigger table.  Thus the hostess kindly told us that we could split up, and she found us tables right next to each other, which was really nice of her to do so!  The food was very good as well.  I didn't expect much from an apple salad, but it was exquisitely made, and lots of flavor. :)  It was about serving of about 2 small ice cream scoops for about $17 with tip.  Not much of a fan for the price, but it was well made, so kudos to that.   The place is also very casual so you don't feel like you need to be all glam'd up galore for the restaurant.    Down to earth place, down to earth people, good Tex Mex place. :)",

    "text": "First of all, I must say the food was good overall.  Normally, it would garner a 4 star vote.  However, when combined with the prices, I got less bang for my buck.  I was told the steak here was well worth the trip and price, but I did not have it.  The restaurant is very tastefully orgainzed and decorated.  The serving staff was cordial and informative.  The restrooms were clean, and had awesome paper towels.    The food arrived in a timely manner and was well presented. The bread is just delicious, but the cornbread muffin was too crumbly.  I would have liked a firmer muffin.  I had the blue corn pancake with roast duck.  The sauces and pancake were very satisfactory, but the duck was tough and stringy.  In addition, it soaked up a lot of sauce and it ended up reminding me of Panda Express BBQ pork.  My entree consisted of the pork tenderloin sandwich with fries.  The fries were nicely seasoned and crispy.  Lots of places can pull that off.  While the pork sandwich was very tasty, I was still disappointed considering the establishment.  I could have made this at home.  The bread was this ciabatta bread like Jack in the Box or Costco.  It was warm and fluffy, but very available.  The pork tenderlion was nice and juicy, and went well with the rest of the sandwich.   While the food quality was very good, the fact that I've had just as good and better at places that charged less drove me for a 3 star review.  That being said, I can easily give the Mesa Grill a 4 star if they paid better attention to not overcooking the duck, making the pork sandwich a more decadent experience, or just dropping the price 5 bucks across the board.  Great food, bleh value.",

I had the pork tenderloin sandwich which was sliced cold pork tenderloin on a hearty bread with nothing else except arugula leaves.  For $16 it was lazy and uninspired with a few fries.  I have had a better sandwich at subway. My wife was excited to go to a Bobby Flay restaurant but was completely let down. I only gave it 2 stars because of the atmosphere food only gets 1star.",

    "text": "Food was OK at best, service was horrible!!!! A few minutes after we were seated the waiter came over and asked if we wanted drinks we said no because we had just had a few while in the casino and wanted to enjoy our meal...he then really pushed the margarita menu and walked away annoyed that we didn't want one.  A few minutes later he came back and asked what we would like to order, I had a few questions about the menu items and once again he was annoyed. My husband ordered the pork tenderloin and I the smoked chicken quesadilla, I asked if I could get some lettuce with my quesadilla and he looked and me and sharply said \"NO\"!!!  I asked if I could have my quesadilla easy on the black beans and he said no the beans are already \"pre-pasted\" at that point I wanted to change my order but worried if I did he would spit in my food! We also ordered the corn with cotija cheese. SERIOUSLY no more that 7 minutes after we ordered our meal was delivered to our table, great if you are at casual eatery but the look and feel of our meal was VERY manufactured. My husband said the first few bites of his tenderloin were good and then the heavily salted and spiced taste got old. My quesadilla was slightly burnt on the bottom but was edible. The corn was sooo salty we had to send it back and we never send food back, but we thought since our waiter was being such a jerk...why not. We exchanged the corn for the asparagus and that was much better. We ate fast an just wanted to get out of the restaurant! It is literally the WORST dining experience we have ever had in Las Vegas",

Overall the food was decent but nothing really amazing, although the tamale that came with the meal was out of this world.  But to have something like a tamale be the thing that I remember the most is a bit disappointing.  While the pork tenderloin was good, it wasn't super special, or at least to me it wasn't.  Maybe because I am not a huge fan of pork in general but I expected more from it because of all the reviews about how amazing it was.  The filet was decent as well but not too memorable either.  Overall if you have the money to spend this place is worth a shot, you make enjoy it better than I did.",

    "text": "I was extremely excited to try Mesa Grill during my recent trip to Las Vegas and I must say I was NOT disappointed. The iron chef blew my mind!   My boyfriend and I made lunch reservations and we were promptly seated even though we got there about fifteen minutes early. The service continued to be wonderful. We were being very clumsy that day - I accidentally spilled my glass of water and my boyfriend dropped his knife on the floor and each time they ran over and replaced the things we needed. I kept apologizing for spilling but the waiter was very nice and told me not to worry about it.    Both of us decided to order from the prix fixe menu, since that would give us the most bang for our buck (three courses for $30). My boyfriend ordered the sweet potato soup topped with smoked chiles, maple crema, and marcona almonds for his appetizer and the spiced pork tenderloin sandwich for his entree. I had the tiger shrimp, roasted garlic, corn tamale with cilantro sauce for my appetizer. I have always lived in places that have given me the best access to fresh seafood, but this was seriously the best shrimp I have ever had in my life! Then I had the pan seared wild striped bass with roasted yellow pepper grits and yellow pepper romesco. All the flavors were so complex. There were so many sauces - spicy, sweet, salty, creamy - it really made the food exciting! We topped it all off with vanilla bean panna cotta with macerated berries. They let the berries soak in grand marnier for two days. YUM!   We were so stuffed by the end that we practically had to roll out of the restaurant, but the deal was so good that we could not resist (plus we did not need to spend money for dinner that night). Definitely eat here! You will not be disappointed!",

My past two experiences here were five-star but tonight I rate it four for two reasons: 1. when we arrived the hostess was unfriendly and appeared put off that we were there. We had an 8:00 reservation and checked in at 7:45 and were told to \"try coming back closer to your 8:00 reservation time.\" Definitely not a good idea to have that reception be your customer's first impression. 2. I asked for the salmon well-done and it arrived rare. I know medium to rare is the desired temp but I'm paying $32 and should get it the way I prefer. We also had the pork tenderloin, never a wrong choice. Don't pass on the coconut layer cake. We were seated at a small table right on the main walkway; good for looking into the kitchen, but awful for all the patrons passing by. Our server, Joel was friendly and very attentive, making our seating situation tolerable. If not for the pork, coconut cake, and Joel I would have rated this two stars.",

I admit I got lost with the wine and which one I wanted. You get a quick taste of a wine you chose and if you approve you're supposed to nod in approval which I almost pulled off. Trust me though, I don't think I would have scoffed and chosen another wine because the first wasn't to my satisfaction.

I was famished and really didn't want to look for another place so we decided to give it a try.  We started of with a few cocktails and they were yummy.  I had some kind of corn soup, It was delicious.  We had a few other appetizers like the tamale, quesadilla, a chili relleno and a few more items.  It was all really good, the only thing we didn't care for was the tamale, which was a bit dry.  The service was fabulous.  We were able to get a table in 15 minutes without a reservation for dinner (cause it was a weekday night).  Bobby Flay does not disappoint.  It was a bit on the pricey side, but reasonable for a nice restaurant.  I will be back again when I am in Vegas next time.",

I asked the waiter if this is how the quesadilla suppose to look like and he replied \"yes...it comes out toasty.\"  I asked, \"by toasty you mean burnt?  Seriously?\"  his answer was \"yes.\"  I should have send that pile of charcoal back to the kitchen.   -Tiger Shrimp & Roasted Garlic Corn Tamales-I was looking forward to this dish.  However, major disappointment.   The tamale was dry and not much of it either.  Flavor was just not there for me.  -Spicy Chicken & Sweet Potato Hash: This came with your choice of creamy grits or southwestern fries.  I was super excited to get a taste of home with the creamy grits.  It came out and I was like What the F is this cream of wheat looking bowl???  Eek...I do not like it whatsover.  The spicy chicken & sweet potato was different but was decent to consume.  Service may be good, but the server that attended us that day is one lazy person.  Shame shame.",

I should add this.... we went there at 3. 15 , well beyond lunch hour but the staff were very helpful and we still got our food....i had the asparagus salad and chile rellino and my partner had spicy chicken.....  I do think they should add another veggie entree....But what i had was gooood.....  Also, most other places would have refused service...not this place...... I do appreciate what the staff did for us ...Also, we did not have a reservation...However, i do recommend a reservation  The reason i gave this place 4 and not 5 stars even though i badly wanted to was for the lack of veggie entree options.....hope ur reading this Bobby Flay",

Bartender was great, we ordered two real margaritas and they were nomnom- lots of tequila, not too sweet. Went down way too easily.  We were seated by our reservation time, even on such a busy weekend.  We ordered the Queso Fundido- omg so good. Flavorful, creamy, and the chips were crisp and salty. Yum.  My husband and I both ordered the Chile Relleno, which had a crispy outside, crunchy skin, and cheesy filling. Absolutely perfect.  We also ordered two sides: the brussel sprouts and the mashed potatoes. Brussels were cooked but still crisp, and had a great flavor. The potatoes were creamy but still had the potato \"lumpiness\" and did I mention the creaminess? Um, yes. Order those when you go.  I had the advantage of the view while we were there- our server (short male) was quite the little diva! He was the entertainment of the evening. Seemly a gossip, but I don't think about us or any other patrons.   We will be back next time we are in Vegas!",

    "text": "Not quite sure how this place is pulling in so many five star reviews.  The only way I can see it is if you are ordering beef or lamb chop.  We were a party of 8 people and the 4 people that ordered the fish dishes were all disappointed.  I had the lambchop which was pretty good but did not blow me away.  Our friend who's 40th bday it was and is a BIG Bobby Flay fan loved his pork tenderloin and that was the most important thing since it was his birthday.   In terms of service, they definitely lose a star ( or more ).  Was not impressed.  Our waiter was friendly enough but just going through the motions, this is Vegas buddy, there are a million places to eat, you gotta step it up !!  There was nothing terrible about the service through out most of the meal but nothing that stood out as good either.  The real kicker came though at the end of the meal when birthday boy went to the bathroom and I asked the waiter if he could bring out a piece of cake or something with a candle in it for the bday boy.  He said \"if you buy a dessert we can stick a candle in it \"  Excuse me!?!? We just dropped $800 and you can't splurge for a piece of cake, he came out instead with a ramekin with whipped cream and a candle stuck in it, was actually embarrassing.   Yes, we could have bought a piece of dessert but at that point it was the principal of the matter. The other annoyance ( which happens at most places these days ) Is the automatic 18% gratuity for groups of 8 or more.  We were forced to tip this amount for sub-par service and spotty food.    Having been to Vegas 9 times, I would say that I would not rush to eat here, there are soooooo many other better choices.  I have walked by this place about 50 times and never had an urge to go in, my hunch was right.",

    "text": "Let me preface this by saying I enjoy dining at upscale restaurants.  Additionally, when I planned my Las Vegas trip, I knew I wanted to eat at a celebrity chef's restaurant (or two...).  Seeing as how Bobby Flay is one of my all-time favorites, it was pretty evident that Mesa would be the restaurant I wanted to choose.  Not to mention, I've heard and read great things about it.    I had called earlier in the afternoon to make reservations for that evening and was excited to hear that they had a few reservations available for a Saturday night (12/1).  However, I was attending a show at 10pm and the two reservations available were 5:30 and 8:30.  The hostess who answered the call was kind enough to tell me that the 8:30 time slot was going to be cutting it close for us and informed me that we could dine at the bar, with a full menu.  I thanked her and figured those were my plans.  The restaurant ambiance is awesome.  The table layout gives each party their own little area to feel cozy, but not alone in the restaurant.  The vibe is energetic and hip.    Upon arrival, we told the hostess that we were planning to dine at the bar because the wait for a table was 45-50 minutes.  She pointed out that a few specific guests sitting at the bar would be leaving to go to their table shortly.  I appreciated the tip.  Within maybe 15 minutes, the seats became available and we hopped up to the bar.    The bartender greeted us and I didn't order a specialty drink, but my Ketel martini was made perfectly.   I had already eaten a lot earlier that day, so I ended up only ordering an entree: Black Florida Grouper.  My expectations were extremely high for this restaurant and unfortunately, the entree fell short.  My grouper was way overcooked.  It was tough and it didn't flake at all.  It was dry, but some of the sauce made up for that.  The flavor was definitely there -- the execution was not.  My friend ordered the Cornmeal Crusted Chile Relleno, which she said was delicious.    Additionally, being that I work in the service industry, I do not complain a lot and chose not to with this dish.  But I was very disappointed when our bartender didn't even ask how our dishes were.  In fact, we were pretty much ignored for most of the meal after our entrees were dropped.  I had to ask for the check myself after my empty entree plate sat in front of me for 10-15 minutes.    All in all, the food was mediocre and the service was as well. The only positive notes were the helpful hostesses.  Very disappointing for me to say the least, especially since this was the one part of the trip I was looking forward to.",

We waited 15 minutes while several walk ins were sat before us. The host was rude when our table was ready and acted like he didn't want us threre. The server had no personality and made us feel like it was an inconvenience for him to have to answer our questions about the menu. We waited an hour to get our food while people who were sat after us got there food. We ended up leaving because we felt that this staff really didn't want to serve us. Walking out there was no apology at all and a group of the wait staff had gathered around to giggle at chat amongst each other. The  host who had originally sat us didn't question why we were leaving and didn't show any concern for our dissatisfaction. We just asked to pay for our beverages he said our waiter would bring us the bill. The waiter brought the ticket again with no apology and told us that well done takes a long time to cook. Not even the manager came to check on why we were leaving which really solidified our fellings of being mistreated. I'm so bummed because I look up to Bobby and really wanted this experience to be amazing, rather it's put a terrible taste in my mouth about who he has representing him. I never do these reviews but really hope that something is done so that nobody ever has to feel like we did ever again.",

    "text": "My two friends and I wanted to go some where nice since it's gonna be a mini reunion for us. I decided to try Mesa Grill cause it would be fun to say we tried a restaurant of a famous chef we all know from food network, Bobby Flay.  First off, I was slightly annoyed that we had to wait to be seated at our reserved table because not all members of our party were there yet. Our party was ONLY 3 people. My friend and I had to wait in the lounge for over 30 minutes because only one person was late, due to the crazy traffic on the strip. Really? Couldn't we just sit at our table that we reserved and be more comfortable to chit chat? I'd understand if our party was like 6 people and only two people were there to check in to sit in the lounge area.  We got drinks in the mean time, which were very good, the classic margarita and the mojito.   For dinner, my friend ordered the pork tenderloin, which is a popular hit. The waiter will suggest that the pork loin is best when served pink, so my friend went a long with his suggestion. When the pork loin came out, it was REALLY pink, rare pretty much. She is not the person to really say anything and toughs it out usually, but she actually had to ask them to take it back and make it well done. The server was nice enough to take it back to the kitchen and served her a well done version, which did not disappoint. The meat was still very delicious and tender. Then towards the end of our meal, we noticed that table next to us had to send their pork tenderloin back too because it was too rare. So quick tip for this is to not get the pork loin rare or ask for medium well, its still very good well done. I had the lamb chops which were very good. The tamale that is served with it is to do die for. My other friend had the salmon. All our meals were very tasty. It was still a fun experience.",

Both the pork tenderloin and ribeye are top-notch, spicy, sweet, perfectly seared. The buttery sweet potato tamale with pecans is awesome! Better than the side of blue corn basil tamale. Even the bread basket is awesome - chili asiago cheese, walnut raisin, blue cornbread... Yummy. We had some chocolate pudding that was delicious, creamy milk chocolatey. Service is friendly, helpful and responsive. My son loves the cheese quesadillas they will make for kids.

    "text": "Dear Bobby, I have been a very long-time fan of yours and I have long anticipated eating at one of your restaurants. I was thrilled to get the chance to eat at your place in Caesar's Palace. While I enjoyed very much the cactus pear margarita and the goat cheese queso fundido, I was very disappointed by our server as well as the quality of the Mesa Burger my husband and I shared.  Let me start with our server. If his presentation style was anymore negative about what WASN'T available on the menu that afternoon, we might have left had we not really wanted to try your food and been as hungry as we were. It's one thing to be out of something but it was the WAY he said it. \"Just so you know and don't get your heart set on it, we are OUT of the ribs. They aren't that good anyway\" was how it was presented. Hmmm. Not good. He then described the Tuna \"Nachos\" as being more Tuna tar-tar with a side of tortilla chips and said \"unless you like raw tuna, this isn't for you\". Um...ok. You get the point. This guy clearly needed some training. And I won't throw him under the bus and name him here but email me if you want to know more. As for the burger. I'll go back to our server....we ordered the burger to share and ordered it medium well. He repeated it back to us, medium well and confirmed we wanted to split the order. When the burger arrived, it was all on one plate. I figured he didn't tell the expediter or just didn't note it on the order. We wait a couple minutes and he finally appears with 2 plates and a knife for us to split the burger ourselves. Um...ok. I cut into the burger and it is rare. Ok, rare is an understatement. It was raw. Blood raw. Definitely NOT medium well like we ordered and he confirmed. So we had to flag down a waiter as ours had conveniently disappeared. He came back and said that we had told him medium rare. Um...no we didn't. We never eat anything rare and he had repeated back to us what we wanted which is why I knew he knew what we ordered and just wanted to put it on us. So a new burger came a few minutes later and while that wasn't medium well either, it was a lot better than the raw that we got initially. Unfortunately, your chefs feel the need to ridiculously overseason the burgers to the point where you can hardly taste the burger itself. And the fries? Ugh. An over-seasoned, over fried mess. There was a coating on the fries that totally took away from the potato flavor of the fries.  Quite honestly, this first visit to one of your restaurants was a huge disappointment. I expect more from someone of your caliber and while you didn't cook any of this yourself, this was a representation of your brand. I don't know if that is fair or not, but I guess if you are going to put yourself in the position of being on a pedestal by being on television, you need to hold those who are running your brand to a higher standard. If this is what your restaurants are putting out, I think that you need to spend less time at Food Network and MORE time in your restaurants.  Please read my review on Holsteins and visit their restaurant to see how to really get things done.  Thanks for reading this and I hope you will take it to heart....even though I figure you'll probably never see this and those who really should see it won't really do anything about it. Good luck...",

In fact, there are better tuna steaks in the frozen isle of Trader Joe's.   And of course because it's Bobby Flay's place, the price was outrageous. Maybe it would've been worth it if the place had lived up to its high profile, pretentious, reputation.",

I ordered the sixteen spice chicken salad and my husband ordered cobb lamb salad. My salad was delicious as was my husband's. The food was wonderfully flavored and felt it personified Bobby Flay with all of those southwest flavors. We also had some awesome margaritas. They were so good, we went back the next night and each had one before we went out again that night. Getting thirsty just thinking about them -- yum! Highly recommend Mesa Grill.",

    "text": "While in Vegas I had to try Mesa Grill. I'm a huge Food Network fan, and I've always seen Bobby Flay work so much with chipotle peppers, that I had to see what this place was about.  We went for lunch on a Monday afternoon and the place wasn't that crowded. We were sat promptly and our server came to ask if we had ever been to the restaurant before. Nope.... That we haven't. He explained the menu items and the favorites everyone orders. There was also a three course special they were offering, but that sounded like too much.  Boyfriend and I ordered the Mesa Margarita and it came out in a heart beat. This is def one of the smoothest best margaritas that I've had, but I thought it needed some \"kick\". Figured it would come out with a chipotle salted rim or something. I mean it IS Bobby Flay. But overall really happy with my drink.  As soon as the waiter came back we ordered. Boyfriend got the Salmon and I got the Mesa Burger. It was really tough for me ordering off this menu, because all the menu items are so complex which is why I guess many people love it here. But I'm more of a plain Jane, so the burger seemed fail proof. After ordering we were given a basket of bread with blue corn muffins, raisin bread, and a jalapeno bread. Jalapeno was right up my alley, but the rest weren't hitting the spot. Not a fan of blue corn, not a fan of raisins, so that's really MY fault. Shrugs.  After the good components of the bread were gone, and the margarita gave me that nice little buzz everyone needs when they're in Vegas eating lunch, we waited... and waited.. and waited....  A family of 5 set down next to us about 10 minutes after we arrived, and got their food well before us. Actually finished it before ours came out. Another couple ordered after us as well and were gone before our food came out. We spent a good 1.5 hours there, and most of that was waiting on our food. Something like 45 minutes? The server came out a few times letting us know that it would be 'right out'.... Not sure what happened. Maybe someone lost the ticket.. but I think the server was pretty irresponsible for not checking with the back after the 20 minute wait mark.  All in all I think this is a great little get away in Vegas. If my pallet was more up to par, I would have enjoyed my food more. Horseradish mayo = ewwwie. My boyfriend's salmon did not have any sides with it, and for $22 I expected more from his plate. My favorite part was my chipotle salted french fries. Not sure if I'll be back for an actual meal, but next time I'll get some chips, salsa and a few margaritas.",

    "text": "This place had a lot of hype and my sisters were going to see Celine Dion so we decided to check it out. Upon entering I really appreciated the layout and decor of the restaurant, plenty of bright colors and a lot of people who looked to be having a great time.   The host was pretty full of himself, we did not have reservations and he made it pretty clear that we should have. But upon looking down at his reservation list we were immediately seated. I understand that the place is popular, but there is no need to be arrogant to customers just because you are working at a high-end eatery.  Our server was definitely a step up from the host, but his voice definitely let us know that it was not OK for my sisters to order appetizers for their entrees. My sisters both ordered quesadillas, my dad and I ordered the pork and rib-eye. Everything tasted great with the exception of the homemade steak sauce on my rib-eye. Perhaps I am the exception, but I don't want what tasted like A1 on a $46 rib-eye, the steak itself was awesome, but the sauce was definitely lacking.  4.5 stars for the great food, margaritas, and atmosphere... dumped to 3 stars for typical Vegas service that I would expect from a bouncer with a group of 10 guys trying to get into Marquee.",

    "text": "I had brunch here with 7 other friends. The order was as follows (Best to Worst, 1-6):   Bread Assortment (complimentary) There were about four different kinds. A couple of them were a little spicy with jalapeno, very good overall.   (3) Queso Fundido $12 A light goat cheese fondue with bits of peppers served with blue tortilla chips. I've had this one before at the NYC location and it's consistently good.  (1) Spicy Chicken + Sweet potato hash $18 Great breakfast dish. It came with with poached eggs and a green chile hollandaise sauce.  (1) Scrambled Eggs Chiliquiles with Roasted Tomatillo Sauce White Cheddar Cheese + Creme Fraiche $14 Another great dish. It came with one of the same sauces as the chicken dish, but it was a solid sauce. I had no clue what Chiliquiles were, so here's the wikipedia for your reference:  Chilaquiles is a traditional Mexican dish consisting of fried or dried tortilla chips, bathed in green or red salsa or mole and broiled or grilled with a cheese topping. Sometimes chicken strips are mixed into the sauce, or the dish can be served with a fried egg on top or a strip of meat alongside.  They are most commonly eaten at breakfast time, served alongside with fried or scrambled eggs or a Mexican style grilled beef. Moreover, chilaquiles are often lauded as a cure for the common hangover.  Unlike nachos, which are served as a crispy snack, chilaquiles are a main dish and are not served until the tortilla chips are thoroughly soaked and softened by the salsa. This makes them a popular recipe for stale chips or those with a bad taste as the other flavors mask the chips'.  (5) Mesa Burger $16 The most memorable part of this dish was the price. The fries were pretty good; crispy outside, seasoned well. But, nothing special about the burger.  (6) New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich with Grilled Red Onion, Arugula, and Ancho-Chile Mayonnaise $15 I thought this was the worst of the dishes. The beef was tender, but it lacked flavor, was too thin, was initially served cold and the bread was too thick for the sandwich. The waiter said the previous bakery burned down and they were testing new bread. The ancho mayo was good, but the flavor was overpowered by the 2 lbs. of bread.  (4) Grilled Mahi Mahi with Roasted Pineapple-Cascabel Chile Sauce and Caramelized Pineapple-Green Onion Salsa $24 I was hung over, which is the only way I could why I order this dish. The sauce was good and the fish seemed to be lightly scented with honey. The texture was a little dry. Overall, not worth $24. The waiter said it was the best thing on the menu, maybe he meant the priciest thing on the menu.  My friend got a bloody mary. I'm not a fan of tomato juice or blood for that matter, but it looked of pretty good quality.   Service Very slow. Starting with the water, to the other drinks, to the bread, to the starter, and ending with the entrees. They were consistent with it, at least. And still kind of pissed that he recommended the mahi mahi.  So, what did we learn? For brunch, stick to the br and stray from the unch. Based on my experience in NYC, you may want to try dinner also and stick to red meat.",

This review is written sober but I sure had my fair share of their excellent Margaritas. We had such great service that day. They had prix fixe menu that day aside from the regular brunch menu. They didn't have the crab cakes on the regular menu but we asked the waiter and he was nice enough to ask the Chef and he made an exception for us! The crabcake was amazing. Just enough crunch on eat side with big chunks of crab along with their sauce. I can't rave about it enough because I am already a big crabcake person.  Bobby Flay is always make tamale this tamale that on his shows so I had to try his tamale. It's say it was pretty good but not the best tamale I've ever eaten. Lastly, we had the special taco and that was just ok.   All it all it was a fabulous meal!",

We ended up getting a loaded baked potato and tamale filled with goat cheese. Ok, forget about the sides, the salmon was amazing!

Amazing-foodtastic-gasmic-succulent-filling-mouthwatering-dishes that lines your tummy with happiness to fill the void of all the money you've lost gambling and to satisfy those alcoholic taste buds.   I'm a Vegas Veteran...or so I like to think so... and since I've turned 21 and experienced Vegas like never before (all 10ish times since then), I've made a vow to only club at the finest of clubs and eat at the finest of places the city has to offer. Honestly, PASS on the endless buffets and make a reservation for Mesa Grill. I don't know how everybody else does it with a full on 3-course meal--appetizers, side dishes, desserts and all--but the entree alone had me STUFFED and knocked me out cold once I got back to my hotel (it could have also been the Cactus Pear margarita I got...) PORK TENDERLOIN, that is all you need to know when ordering and don't even think about second guessing yourself. It may look like 3 itty pieces of meat, but trust me, those 3 bites go a loooong way. Every single bite of the perfectly marinated piece of pork topped with bourbon and ancho chile sauce was another step closer to heaven. And yes, I ultimately reached that heaven at the end of my meal because I haven't stopped thanking the Iron Chef gods for blessing Bobby Flay with an outstanding recipe. My boyfriend's chipotle glazed rib eye was also generously served fresh out the kitchen and had grill marks that left a beautiful shine to the meat and even a better taste in my mouth! Oh, and the side of mashed potatoes we got? Freakin' delicious. Literally reminded me of buttered popcorn that's been softened and beat to goodness!   Thus, save that money you might lose gambling anyways and spend it towards dinner here. The odds are, you're gonna have a winning meal! Mesa Grill. Las Vegas. Place your bets. NOW.",

    "text": "I love Mesa Grill, and it's really just as simple as that.   Every time I go to Vegas I will end up here one way or another. My last visit to Vegas I ended up only at the bar as I forgot to make reservations so my boyfriend and I just came for mojitos. Yes, just mojitos. And you know what, they're worth the $14 a piece for them.  So over the years this place has progressively increased their prices which sucks, but the quality of food has always been top-notch. Plus, it's rare that I have good Tex-Mex cuisine. What I get is always California washed out Mexican food. This is a fantastic change while keeping the integrity of so many familiar ingredients.  My favorite appetizers are a tie between the goat cheese queso fondidu and the the blue corn pancake with BBQed duck. Now, many years ago the queso fondidu used to be melted goat cheese with a poblano salsa which I actually preferred over the rajas they serve with it now. That's just my personal preference though, but I still really like it a lot. With the blue corn pancake I've had inconsistencies with the amount of duck, and how they've plated it. Mixed in --- or sliced on top --- I'm assuming maybe it was just the quality of the duck, or from where they got the meat from. Breasts slice nicely, so that goes on top. Thigh not so much, so that get mixed in? Ok. Still good. I love duck in any way, so no complaints on my end taste-wise.  From the most current menu, I'd have to say the pan roasted venison is my favorite and a close second would be the New Mexico spiced pork tenderloi. I've never ordered the 16 spice chicken however I've had it a couple of times over the years from picking off of other people's plates and the chicken has always been consistently good and never dry.   There used to be a spiced steak on the menu a long time ago and I wish they'd bring that back. :( The last two times I haven't ordered a steak so I don't know if any of the new steaks even compare. The ribeye looked fantastic, maybe next time I will order that.   I'm sure next time I'm in Vegas I'll be back again, like I always am, even if it's just for a mojito. I love Mesa Grill.",

    "text": ":o)!!!!  Bobby Flay.... you son of a bitch...... Here I am, thinking that you're some asshole that's famous based on your looks and cockiness.  Boy was I WRONG.  You made me eat my words and boy were those words DELICIOUS!  Ladies and gentleman.... this man knows how to cook!  I walked in here thinking that it was all hype, but the four of us were HIGHLY impressed with all our dishes and bread basket.  The food: Bread basket - There was a good mixture of sweet and savory breads.  I should have taken notes but some of the stand outs were the coffee cake, corn bread, and what we named the jalapeno cheese \"popper\", so basically all the breads they were offering.  Crispy bacon + hash brown quesadilla (fried egg + spicy tomato salsa) - The cheese was nice and melty with the perfect crunch of bacon to go along with each bite.  Spicy chicken + sweet potato hash (poached eggs + green chile hollandaise) - I just about died tasting this dish.  The sweet potato was a nice twist that was added to a normally savory eggs benedict dish.  Every bite I stole from my friend just made me melt with happiness.  So do yourself a favor and succumb to the understanding that this dish is highly recommended for a reason.  Blue corn buttermilk waffle (blackberry bourbon syrup + vanilla creme fraiche) - OHHHH MY GOSH!!!!!!  I love waffles, but my god... I LOVE THESE WAFFLES.  The vanilla creme......*drool*.... just about slapped me across the face.  One bite of this waffle made me bow down in shame and made me realize that Bobby Flay is the shit!    Mark my words, I WILL be back to try out the dinner service and hopefully that meal will be amazing and leave the same lasting impression, if not, better one than my spectacular brunch.",

    "text": "I was in town for a convention at Caesars and was staying at the hotel.  I made a point of making a reservation a few weeks before arriving to eat at Mesa Grill while there with some co-workers.  Plus, I'm a big fan of eating well when I can bill it back somewhere.  And boy did we bill a nice expensive 300 dollar 3 person meal.  The restaurant is a very fun festive atmosphere.  Its right in the middle of the casino.  If I had one non menu related criticism, it would be the location within the casino.  It's right next to the sports book and its a very hectic location.  Having said that, they do a good job isolating you from it once inside the restaurant.  We had dinner reservations so we were ordering from their dinner menu.  I personally had the venison entree.  Venison seems to be something you like or you absolutely avoid.  Others at the table voiced their lifelong dislike for the dish.  I honestly don't discriminate when it comes to meats, so I was all in.  The dish comes with the venison filleted into three pieces and then you get a garlic tamale as a side.  The venison was nothing like the gamy meats you often encounter when eating venison from backwoods hunting trips.  The fillet they served didn't have any more or less of a strong flavor than beef would have had.  The venison was topped with a smoky sauce to compliment the meat.  The garlic tamale was good, but it was a ho-hum side.  It wasn't terribly memorable.  I also sampled the Jalapeno Pork Chops that another person dining with us had.  It was nice lean pork and the jalapeno flavor was great spicy addition to the flavor that really made it pop.   Its great to see a menu that wasn't scared to add some spice to the dishes.  We should have gotten one or two sides to share between the table.  There were others that were convinced we didn't need it.  I think that was a mistake in retrospect.  They're less than 10 dollars and would have complimented the smaller entree portions.  It was a great meal.  Its the type of meal I wouldn't seek to have all the time but once in a while when I'm in town for a convention its great to endulge.  I would like to sample the lunch menu next time I'm in town.  If you're really looking to spend some money on a great meal don't skip Mesa Grill.",

    "text": "I've been back in SF for a few days and have been talking about Mesa Grill non-stop to anyone who would listen.  The Pork Tenderloin was the best piece of pork I've ever eaten and everything leading up to the entree was amazing.    We started out w/the corn soup, salmon & tuna tartare (unbelievable - and I really loved the spice) and squash blossoms all of which were excellent.  The pork was my favorite entree but the bone-in ribeye was also a delicious choice.  I could go on about all of the other entrees we sampled but the praise would get redundant.    The only negative was the sommelier who had a terrible attitude and was not excited about pouring a bottle of wine under  $70.  He kept recommending magnums andy bottles over $100.    If you're in Vegas, book a table at Mesa Grill...don't get sucked in to Mortan's or Ruth's Chris...you'll have a better meal at Mesa.",

I was looking at the prixe fixe menu, at the buffalo burger in particular, and the waiter, a super cool dude who has family in Duxbury (or DELUX-bury, as I like to call it) and knew all kinds of hockey trivia - I will always remember that Gretzky started out with the Indianapolis Racers, I promise - suggested the Mesa Burger as being the better of the two, and it wasn't like he was steering me towards a more expensive selection.    The Margaritas, though pricey, were damn good - not shy on the booze, and after two I was really starting to feel that drink.",

    "text": "We had a 7:30 reservation, but they were a little backed up, so we sat in bar area and had a pre dinner cocktail. I ordered a Gimme A Lemonade, which was probably meant to be equal parts Green Tea Vodka and Lemonade, but was mostly vodka.  Nothing wrong with a strong drink, especially when shelling out 12 bucks for it, but I don't think it was worthy of being a featured cocktail. Should have gone with the Black Widow Mojito.   We were seated after 10 or 15 minutes.  There were 5 of us total, and we each ordered appetizers. The Sea Scallop Ceviche and the Blue Corn Pancake were standouts. The pancake was wrapped around tender BBQ duck  and drizzled with a Habanero-Chile Anise sauce. Amazing.  The Ceviche was so good I literally had to stop myself from slurrping it up like Campbell's Chicken Noodle. Sometimes sharing is no fun.  Also noteworthy was the Beet Salad.   I ordered the New Mexican Spice Ruibbed Pork Tenderloin, with Bourbon Ancho Chile sauce and a Sweet Potato Tamale. It was a huge portion, cooked to a perfect medium temp.  It was delicious, but I kept pilfering from my friend's Fire Roasted Veal Chop, so I could not finish.  I also tried the 16 Spice Duck, which was as good as the Blue Corn app.    Mesa offers a fairly decent wine selection. The 2006 Ken Wright Abbot Claim Pinot Noir  recommended the wine steward worked with every entree.  Our service was very good, and the only reason I am not giving 5 stars is that I felt that the dessert menu left something to be desired.   After dinner we headed straight to Payard for dessert.",

    "text": "As I write this, I can hardly move.  I blame Bobby Flay.  Last night we dined at Mesa Grill and the food was amazing.    I'd planned for this meal all day - akin to preparing for the civilized version of Nathan's hotdog eating contest.  A small breakfast of oatmeal, half a sandwich for lunch, plenty of water.  (Yeah, this is probably how I should eat every day...but we'll avoid that topic for now).    I've had lunch at Mesa Grill before, and that meal had me excited for the dinner.  Back then I had the Southwestern Spice Chicken Skewers.  Think of it as a build your own taco.  The chicken is traditionally grilled on wood skewers (hence the name).  You build it yourself with \"special lettuce\" (a blend of mint, butter lettuce, and cilantro.  Genius.) and a New Mexico Chile Sauce that tastes more like a mole sauce that a chile sauce.  I love good food, especially good Mexican (excuse me, Southwestern Cuisine), and I was clearly really looking forward to another opportunity to dine at Mesa Grill.    No surprise to anyone who knows me, I arrived on time for dinner.  My guests did not.  But the staff was pleasant and courteous none the less, even though they had to refer several people to the \"first come, first served\" bar area as they were booked for the evening.  When my guests finally arrived (OK, they were only 15 minutes late.  'Traffic\"), we started with mojitos (five stars), and the self explanatory Tiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale (a little dry, but tasty none the less).  For dinner we had:  Cornmeal Crusted Chile Relleno with eggplant, manchego cheese, and sweet red pepper sauce.  I love the presentation on this dish.  New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin with bourbon - ancho chile sauce, sweet potato tamale, and crushed pecan butter.  It was really spicy.  I mean REALLY spicy.  I had this medium - pink in the center, delicious.  And the tamale (yeah, another one.  let's not count the calories) had chunks of pecan in the pecan butter.  Happiness.  Finally the Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops with blackberry - cascabel barbecue sauce (brilliant!), and collard greens with smoked chiles.  It didn't disappoint.   The meal took us an hour and a half.  It felt like 15 minutes.  It was a great experience and time literally flew by (mainly because there are no clocks in the casinos).  If you're planning on seeing a show after dinner, give yourself an extra hour or so.  You'll probably need it.   The meal was a bit pricey ($200+ for three), but well worth it.  I've noticed that the lunch menu had many of the same items as the dinner menu - just smaller portions and priced accordingly.",

We got a lot of appetizers: calamari, goat cheese nachos, ahi tuna/salmon tartare, sweet corn tamale and they were all AMAZING! This is obviously more fine dining than a place to grub on so expect to pay a lot for smaller more savior portions.  My boyfriend got the pork tenderloin and it was cooked beautifully, just melted in his mouth. If you're a bobby flay fan, which my bf is, then I'd say check it out! The decor sets the mood for a great date night!  The big negative is that you HAVE to make a reservation.  Food- * * * * Service- * * * * Ambiance- * * * * Price- * * *",

For dessert someone asked for a bowl of choclate ice cream, once again, it will only be served with a ganache of nuts and chocolate(allergy issues be damned). I had a seared tuna that was excellent.

The design of the restaurant was really modern, clean, and had some really great artistic details.  I really liked the rocks on the wall around the bar.  The mojito was really tasty, but I was really here for the food.  If Bobby's gonna \"throw down\" with local chefs around the country, I expected some knock me off my feet food.    While waiting for the rest of the party, my friend L and I had drinks and ordered a mushroom quesadilla with truffle oil.  It was delish!  Complicated flavors. It definitely lived up to my expectations.    For dinner, I ordered the pork tenderloin with sweet potato tamal, which the server said was a specialty.  When the entrees came out, we were all blown away by the presentation.  So artistic and pretty!  But when I took my first bite... I was underwhelmed.  The tenderloin was too salty!  The tamal was tasty, but a little cold.  I much prefer my local neighborhood cart's tamale.  Overall, mixed experience.  Drinks, appetizers, and ambiance were great (4.5 stars).  The entrees (2 stars)... and add to it the expense of dining here... disappointing!",

The brunch menu is mostly several variations on scrambled eggs. It did not have any of the tamales that Bobby Flay is know for. We had to wait a little bit for a table since we had a large group and they had to push some tables together for us. The place has a nice feel with an open kitchen, although the set up made it a little hard to see the kitchen. The guy at the grill seemed to like that we were paying attention to him and kept looking up and smiling at us. In fact, everyone at the restaurant was friendly. The service was really good. At one point, one of the bussers dropped a fork and all three employees in the area went over to pick it up.  I went with their version of steak and eggs. Actually half our group had that and the other half had the Mesa Burger. One person had scrambled egg enchiladas. The steak and eggs and burgers were a decent sized portion and we felt pretty full after, however I think my friend that got the enchiladas was a little disappointed as it cost as much as the burger, but you only got two small enchiladas.  You do get a basket of delicious bread with your meal.  I'd like to try Mesa Grill again, but next time for lunch or dinner. A few notes: the dress code is relaxed in the day. There were several people in tshirt and shorts, myself included. However, they won't let you wear a hat. The table next to us had a very young child with them who was a picky eater and they were happy to make something special for him.",

Walking around the hotel on Sunday early doesn't give you many choices and we blindly stumbled into Mesa Grill (didn't even check Yelp reviews).   We were seated fast and taken care of from the second we sat down. Sadly the brunch menu didn't have the dish I was craving (their version of a Cuban) but I found up trying this southwestern steak sandwich item that was top notch. I special ordered a side of grits and they were to die for. I ended up ordering another side of them because I couldn't deal without more of that. Properly made grits west of the Mississippi is pretty amazing in itself.   The price was a tad steep for what I received which led to the 4 star instead of 5 but it is Vegas and we were at Caesar's so it is to be expected. I just think it notched the place a little back to reality for me.",

My drink (pink margarita I think? that says a lot right? lol) was super delicious!!! Oh I could have sat there and keep drinking that all day long.  Unfortunately I wasn't too wild about the appetizer queso fundido, I mean it was good, but it's melted cheese. Ok i get it.   I had grilled pork tenderloin that was decent but not great, and the bf had shrimp tacos suggested by the waiter. I thought the shrimp was really good but a rip off since the plate had only 6 shrimps and 2 tortillas!!!  Wow, really, Bobby? That's an appetizer size, not entree size!

Maybe it was because of the food. Everything we had was delicious, each with its own memorable thing.  Appetizers: -Roasted corn soup- tasty. I enjoyed the hint of avocado and salsa in the center of the bowl. It complimented the soup. -Blue Corn Pancake with BBQ Duck - the hit at the table. It came highly recommended and one of the signature dishes on the menu. The thin blue corn crepe wrapped slices of AMAZING BBQ duck. And the sauce had a very nice spice to it.  Entrees: -Lobster Out of the Shell - yummy yummy especially since I didn't have to fight with it getting it out of the shell. The butter sauce was delish (who doesn't love butter?) and the crispy hominy cakes were a nice contrast in texture. -Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops - mmm. cooked to perfection. Nice flavors and the sauce  -Spiced Rubbed Pork Tenderloin - the meat was nice and tender and the rub on the outside of the pork gave it a really nice spice. -Pan Seared Halibut - it didn't taste bad, but it wasn't as memorable as the other dishes.  Side dish: Double baked potato- had a light horseradish flavor, and overall a good baked potato.  Dessert: -Pineapple Buttermilk Upside down cake - disappointing. The caramelized rum sauce was very strong and I didn't enjoy it. However, the accompanying pineapple vanilla ice cream was very light and refreshing. -Creme brulee - a nice large portion topped with fresh berries. A good standard creme brulee. -Churros- i had high expectations for these since I had just seen Samantha Brown dipping churros in chocolate in Spain. haha. They weren't bad.",

The sauce was spicy and pork soft but the bread tasted like cardboard. I don't know what happened there. The bread they gave us before our meals were great.  The fries were dry and tasted leathery.   My bf ordered some lamb salad with bacon. The salad was okay but nothing exciting. (this was not part of the pre-fixe)  The dessert was a key lime pie ice cream with two cookies. I guess this was a decent dessert but a little bit plain.   I guess seeing Bobby Flay on tv made me think that he was creative with food. I guess that's only for tv. Wish his persona on TV came out in his restaurants.",

    "text": "Upon arrival we studied the menu.   My 32 year old daughter is allergic to many spices.  Her lips grow huge for a couple of days.   Because of this, she eats simply.   There was not anything on the menu that would accommodate her.   She asked for the chicken quesadilla without the chicken (spices are usually used in cooking chicken in Southwest restaurants).   We were told the Mesa Grill had a policy of keeping the integrity of the recipes intact.  I must say we try and keep the integrity of our family's health intact.  But the polite wait staff said it really did not matter because the quesadillas were made ahead of time, and this in an expensive restaurant (Taco Time does not even do that).  My daughter then tried to order the children's quesadilla, but she was told we would need to get special permission from the manager.   I told our staff she could charge us whatever she wanted.  Can you believe this? Could they be any less accommodating.   At that point the 6 of us had just had our drinks delivered and informed our wait staff we needed the bill and were leaving.   Now we were in a large section of the restaurant with only two other tables occupied.    One person at one table, two people at the other.   I think our wait staff realized how incredible our lunch was becoming (and saw her best tip walking out) because she said she would make the children's quesadilla herself.  Boy we sure worked for that concession.  I was really surprised, because we eat out a lot at home in Seattle.  Restaurants are always very nice about allergies there. I think many restaurants know this is a risky way to run a restaurant.   Most people know you do not play with allergies.  They are scary to best.  On to the rest of our food!   I did order the chicken quesadilla.   It had 3 flour tortillas and was very dry.   Guess that is what happens when you make them ahead of time.    My husband ordered a steak salad.   He left most of it, because it was so spicy he did not like it.  They used all the sharp lettuces (no romaine).  The lettuce was also cut in such large pieces you had to try either to cut it with no place to cut, or twirl it onto your fork. Bite size pieces would have been much nicer.   The cheese was aged too long and completely overpowered the salad.   There was nothing special about the rest of the food.  It was very mediocre.  So sad to waste your time and money on a trip.    Oh, and did I mention that we were all looking forward to guacamole.   They only had guacamole jam and refused to serve it in a larger portion as an appetizer.   Way to go.   You are doing a great job in alienating your customers.     I truly liked our wait staff.   She just had to follow some very bad directives.  In our line of business (which is not food) we try never to say \"no\" to a reasonable request. We believe that when  it is the customers money they are usually right.    We try very hard to make sure the customer leave our establishments happy and hope they enjoyed their experience.   I think Bobby needs a new business plan.",

We have really enjoyed some of his cooking shows so we had high hopes for our mean.   The pros are that they managed to create a unique new-age Spanish atmosphere in the middle of Caesar's. The second is that they know how to cook meat PERFECTLY. My boy got the pork chop and was blown away by spice and tenderness. The last positive was that service was stupendous. There was never a moment where are drinks weren't full or our requests weren't immediately answered.   The OKAY aspect of Mesa was their specialty drinks... each one had unique flavor combinations but come on people... add some really alcohol here!!! I mean we are in Vegas baby!  The negatives were that everything else we ordered was BLAND BLAND BLAND!!!! We started off with the Queso Fundio. I ordered their stuffed pepper and all the side we shared were boring as well: double baked potato, corn bread and the collard greens. I was so disappointed I wanted to warn people walking in the restaurant that is wasn't worth our money.   Summary... BLAND overpriced food overpowered the good service and atmosphere.",

Ok, so this restaurant is not so small, in fact it's huge!  But not in size, in popularity and for good reason!  The service was fantastic, the design of the place is spectacular, and the food?  OMG!!!  The food is some of the best we have ever tasted in a very long time!  Everything that we ordered was perfect and yummy!  We started off with appetizers:  Yucatan Chicken Tacos Grilled Red Onion +Peanut-Smoked Chile Barbecue Sauce  Goat Cheese \"Queso Fundido Rajas + Blue Corn Tortilla Strips   OMG!!  Amazing!!  I ordered:  Mango + Spice Crusted Tuna Steak Green Peppercorn-Green Chile Sauce + Toasted Pine nut Cous Cous   My husband ordered:  New Mexican Spiced Rubbed Pork Tenderloin Bourbon-Ancho Chile Sauce Sweet Potato Tamale + Crushed Pecan Butter   The Tuna was cooked to perfection as was the Pork Tenderloin.  The sauces that went with these dishes were amazing and I can see why Bobby Flay is one of the best Chef's in the World!  My Tuna came with Couscous which had a taste that was indescribable and cooked to perfection, and My husbands Pork Tenderloin had a Sweet Potato Tamale that came with it that was so delicious it was like eating desert along with your main course!  We shared desert.  A Banana Creme Pie!  Yummy right?  Not as impressive as the rest of the dinner, but good at that.  Wasn't real sweet and seemed to be lacking something.  But all in all our time spent at the Mesa Grill was a Fantastic one, and we will go back again and again",

    "text": "After thinking about the good food from Mesa Grill for a month, I finally had a chance to go back to Las Vegas.  Needless to say, I opted for Mesa Grill again.    Again, we were there for lunch so we can avoid the crowd and the wait.  We were promptly seated and our waiter, John, even offered to snap a few pictures inside the kitchen for us.  That was really nice of him since we were very interested in what is like behind the scenes.  My wife ordered the Honey Glazed Salmon again and it was even better than the first time.  I went for the prix fixe menu items and ordered the corn tamale and the pork tenderloin sandwich.   The corn tamale is still my favor and the pork tenderloin sandwich is very unique.   Tips: - For lunch, there's always the prix fixe menu.  You'll get to choose one of five appetizers and one of three entrees, plus dessert!  This will save you a bit of money.  - The pork tenderloin sandwich is meant to be a room temperature sandwich, so if you like hot sandwiches, this is NOT what you want to order.",

First off, it's less expensive than some of the other restaurants on the Strip, but it is far from cheap just to let you know.  I ordered a margarita, with my choice from a bewilderingly long list of tequilas, with some kind of other liqueur in it, which was pretty good, but definitely don't get the shot of liqueur... couldn't taste the difference.    But that steak I ordered?  Rubbed with chipotle flavored seasoning, and red and green chile sauce?  Uhh- mazing.  And not as expensive as a steak at STK or the like.  I had some awesome spicy collard greens with it as well, which required me to devour that delicious jalapeno cornbread that came with it.  All in all?  Try this place.  It's not crazy expensive, but it is crazy good.",

    "text": "The only reason this place gets business is because it is a Bobby Flay restaurant.  I was not impressed with the food at all.    I had a prickly cactus margarita (it was a delicious reddish pink color and was amazing) and Hubs tried a mezcal (which is like tequila but isn't).  For starters, we went with the server's recommendation. She said it is the most \"popular\" appetizer - Tiger Shrimp with Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale and cilantro sauce.  This was SMALL.  There were four medium sized (I think they were smaller than they should have been) shrimp with a tamale on the side. It really looked like the tamale was the main part of the dish and the shrimp were the side garnish.  There was nothing special about the shrimp. They looked like four cooked and peeled shrimp. I was pretty disappointed.  For the mains, Hubs had the rabbit  - Cascabel Chile Crusted Rabbit with toasted chile cous cous, almonds, currants in a smoked red pepper sauce and I had the Halibut with green chile curry sauce and corn and cactus salsa. Originally, this was supposed to be Wild Stripe Bass, but there were some weather issues back East so they didn't get their fish shipment in that day.  My halibut was good. Nice crunch on the top of the fish and the green chile curry sauce was mild.  I liked it. It was a huge portion of fish.  Hubs' rabbit was just ok - most people don't like the gamey flavor of rabbit, but that is what the rabbit lacked. It tasted more like chicken than rabbit.    For dessert, we had the banana cream pie.  It was pretty light and a good way to end the meal.  The service was ok. At first, the server was very attentive and quick but after we got our appetizers, she was quite slow. Having experience in the food industry, I did notice that her section filled up quickly and she had small tables like us but also parties of 6 or more. She was friendly enough though.  I believe there are better Mexican restaurants in Vegas.  Mesa Grill is known for grilling so maybe the steaks are better?",

    "text": "Mesa Grill is a Bobby Flay restaurant so there are lots of chiles in everything. Not that this necessarily makes everything spicy, but you should know in case you have a pepper or spice aversion. I arrived late one evening to Vegas and after checking in to my room at Caesar's Palace I decided 1, I needed dinner and 2, I didn't want to go far so Mesa Grill answered my needs.  I've said it before but I'll say it again so no one thinks I ate all this food by myself - I'm a sharer so when I go anywhere I like to order lots of stuff and share it with my dining partners. With this in mind we started with a Caesar type salad that came with chorizo as the meat and it was definitely an interesting take on this basic starter. One that I definitely enjoyed. We then ordered the black bean soup, grits with poached egg, and the pork tenderloin with sweet potato tamale as our main course to sample.  The black bean soup had just the right amount of spice to it and so I slurped most of it up. The pork tenderloin was indeed tender and the sweet potato tamale that accompanied it was amazingly good. But, the real highlight of the meal was the grits topped with a poached egg. Coming from the South I've had my fair share of grits, sometimes they are made sweet with butter and sugar, sometimes they are made savory with spices and bacon, but I'm going to start suggesting they always come this way from now on. It was an item of food that would be just as comfortable at breakfast as it was at dinner and I wouldn't hesitate to order it again.  Our service was also marvelous, the man who served us told us he'd been with the restaurant since they opened and his expertise in suggesting certainly made it seem so.",

I love Bobby Flay and am addicted to his shows on the Food Network so I guess my expectations were a bit higher??? Really Bobby...Really?! I thought if he is going to put his name on this restaurant then it's gotta be awesome...wrong!  My friend ordered the Ancho Chili Honey Glazed Samon, it was good, nothing I would rave about. Better than my dish.  I ordered the coffee rubbed filet mignon (sounds exciting right?!) Wrong again. I thought the robust flavor of coffee with a filet would be an interested and unique flavor combination. NOPE. Just put a bunch of stale coffee grinds on top of a filet and there you go. The filet was basically raw as well-not the way i ordered it.   The service...OY. Horrible! she didn't even check on us after she took our order. Didn't even care that i didn't eat my raw piece of meat. I'm really not that harsh but I've been in the service industry for years so I really wasn't pleased.

    "text": "I must confess that the main reason I came to Mesa Grill (out of all the restaurants in Las Vegas) is because I have a cowboy brush on Bobby Flay. Despite most negative opinions of celebrity chefs, I think many of them can cook well. Personally, I enjoyed dining at Mesa Grill.   My friend and I came on a Sunday afternoon for brunch. We were both impressed by their staff's cordial and professional service. There was a complimentary bread basket which I was very impressed with and a wide selection of water, YES WATER, to chose from. So service receives 5 stars. Based on the number of parties I saw in the restaurant, reservations are probably not necessary for lunch or brunch. But it might be otherwise for dinner.  We started off with Chef Flay's famous Tiger Shrimp and Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale. I think this appetizer was definitely True to Flay's southwestern stile and is a must try. The shrimp was cooked perfectly, tender and sweet; corn tamale was fresh and fluffy and the his signature sauces were extremely flavorful. Each bite has a familiar spice kick.  Then, we ordered the BBQ Lamb Cobb Salad and the Eggs + Aged Strip Loin Tortilla. The cobb salad and lamb were divine! I loved the buttermilk dressing, so good!  The tortilla dish was on the mediocre side and made me wish I ordered the Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash (which has been on the menu for the last 8? years) However, I was mainly looking for a steak for lunch so it satisfied for cravings. Honestly, I could have gone without the egg and myriad of relishes (very beautifully plated) because the strip loin was cooked really well (medium rare, which I think is how all good meat should be cooked). It was incredibly tender and melts in your mouth. I will definitely have to come back for dinner to try his Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin.  ALSO, I LOVED the complimentary bread basket. The waiter describes what each bread piece is and each was delicious on its own. :)",

    "text": "We were doing some strolling through Ceasar's Palace on New Years and, after some light shopping, started to work up a nice appetite. My boyfriend would probably challenge me on my definition of \"light\" gauging by his lack of jubilance in my shopping endeavors. But this is Ceasars Palace we're talking about here...a shopper's mecca!! Sorry, I digress... now on to the brunch.  My boyfriend has been to Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill NY location and he recommended we try his westcoast counterpart. Sometimes him and I depart on our culinary appraising, but in this instance are thoughts and assessments were in full-fledged alliance.   There was a 30 minute wait, which wasn't too bad considering it was New Year's weekend and home of culinary/restaurateur extraordinaire, Bobby Flay. I was blown away by their Saturday Brunch (which is served till 3 p.m. on Saturdays & Sundays). Mid-meal, ( I just couldn't wait till the end of brunch) I was already singing -- well, actually texting -- Mesa Grill praises to a few friends and family.  I went with our server's recommendation and a Mesa Grill favorite brunch item -- the Spicy Chicken & Sweet Potato Hash. It was unforgettable! The blend of poached eggs, savory grilled chicken, sweet potato cubes, bell peppers, salsa and green chile hollandaise was staggering. Pair that with one of their savory bread basket medley items, which is divinity in a basket, and your taste buds will be working full throttle. The fresh-baked jalapeno cornbread muffins, tequila berry scones and raspberry coffee crumb cake squares were delicious! My boyfriend said the scone was the best ever!   My boyfriend orded the Lamb Cobb Salad and one of their specialty drinks, a whiskey & champagne concoction. A real rarity for my boyfriend to order a salad but I think he gravitated toward the fusion of barbequed lamb, avocado, blue cheese and bacon & buttermilk dressing. He loved it!  Mesa Grill is truly worth experiencing if you're in Vegas. The swanky southwestern decor and dishes are sensational.  I will sing, text, write and dance Mesa Grill praises for some time to come. Maybe one day I'll try the New York or Bahamas location :-)",

Like most awesome popular places, be prepared to pay for it...especially in Vegas.  I went with a buddy and we split the steak and lobster tacos.  Lord those lobster tacos were little as hell! They definitely serve small portion apps to get you to the higher prices entrees.  Nonetheless, they were both amazing tasting.  I paired my dinner with a top shelf margarita, which was fabulous and strong.  Service was pretty good.  All in all...thumbs up Flay! I'll be back.    Cheers.",

We were a party of 4 business people in Las Vegas for a food convention.  All of us know our food.  I am going to address what I ordered--Corn Tamales and Short Ribs.  The tamales were made from a fresh, chunky (whole corn) masa.  If my memory is correct it was filled with pork.  Small portion, but very rich and fulfilling.  My short ribs were the best I had. They were served over a polenta-style base.   The deserts were a little weak.  The Chocolate Strawberry Shortcake was not fulfilling at all.  The rest of our party was pretty impressed with their aps and entrees as well and felt the desserts were in need of improvements.  Great service from the hostess to the server to the busser.",

Menu varies for lunch & dinner. We chose to go for an early dinner - around 5-ish. We were seated right away in the back part of resturant in a round table. Was a nice \"view\" of the resturant, cooking stations, and other tables. Perhaps a little less noisy than the rest of the place. We were able to talk amongst ourselves just fine. (Even share a bit of conversation wtih members of the table right next to us.)  Adults had the Tuna steak. (I really enjoyed it medium-rare. My husband had it med-well.) The poblano-peppercorn sauce was tasty and married well with the couscus. Our portions were a good size, I thought. We also had an order of the lobster tacos - good flavor. I agree wth Cat P. that the asiago cheese jalapeno bread was the best of all the breads in the bread basket ;-)   We initially were going to order a couple apps for the kids - but our waiter suggested a burger or cheese burger for them. (Nice touch! And worth the $12 for a grade-A burger w/ fries.)  They enjoyed refillable sodas/lemonaide. While the adults drank tasty margaritas - go ahead, try the signature White peach Margarita!    Desert... ah, the finishing touch on a great meal. We shared 2 deserts: toasted coconut cake and banana cream pie. Not too sweet and hit the spot.   Service notes: Our waitstaff was attentive, knowledgable about the menu, and were delightful with the two kids.  What we might do differently next time: Say no to the mineral water ($8.50 per bottle was a bit too spendy.)  It was a good meal that came with a price. It could be considered your \"big spend\" item while visiting. We would consider coming back (just with Adults).   Save a Margarita for me.....!",

From the drinks to the appetizers to the main courses- everything was delicious and impressive. The goat cheese fundido appetizer was to.die.for and the chilaquiles (that I ordered as my main course) were some of the best Ive ever had (and I like to think of myself as a chilaquiles connoisseur; its one of my favorite brunch items and Ive had them all over California, in Chicago, Austin, and now Las Vegas).  Im not really one to drink margaritas (they're much too sweet and they typically contain crappy ingredients), but Mesa Grill's \"skinny\" margarita (the Partida Margarita) was delicious and, thankfully, not overly sweet since in was only sweetened with agave nectar instead of simple syrup or plain sugar or other questionable sweeteners.   Overall: I would highly recommend dining at Mesa Grill if you have the chance. Great service, wonderful food, impressive margaritas, and conveniently located at Caesar's Palace.",

Everything was sub par except for the lobster which was also disappointing as they consisted of 3 bite sized tacos.  Everyone left disappointed expecting a Bobby Flay restaurant to wow us. Sub par at best. That started our vacation and we've told everyone how awful it is and that they should never go there. In all honesty the food court smokes this establishment.

We shared the goat cheese queso, which was deliciously creamy and spicy and served with blue corn chips, the tiger shrimp and tamale, and a crab cake special, which had cilantro and jalapeno I believe. Everyone enjoyed their main courses, but my mother, sister, and I are not meat people, so preferred the appetizers. My husband and dad really loved their steaks! No room for dessert, but everything on the menu sounded delicious. The atmosphere was great and service was everything you would expect from a high end restaurant. Would definitely recommend.",

    "text": "We came here for the Mesa Burger and that is what we got.  Let me say 1st that beware making a reservation via Open Table. We did and the cancellation policy states that if you don't cancel by the time they say, you will be charged. Well, that time that was associated was the day before! WTH?! Yup, if we didn't cancel the reservation over 24 hours before we made it, we'd get charged. Go figure. Warning, you do have to leave a credit card to make a reservation.  I talked with the manager and he said the cancellation policy was not so. Well, I showed him i-Phone shots of our reservation (which I did NOT make) and he was astounded. He said he'd look into it.  Anyway, without a reservation, we got a table for two immediately, just before a convention let out across the hall and the restaurant flooded with people. Beware this point. I don't know how you would check, but if a convention is in residence and a seminar lets out, it's going to be tough to get seated.  So, onto the food.   1st, the margarita. WOW!...just WOW! outstanding! Beautifully done and tasted great. In fact, I could go for one right now! :)  Next, the MESA BURGER * Double Cheddar Cheese Grilled Vidalia Onion + Horseradish Mustard served with Southwestern Fries. It, too, was great. A definite keeper and something I'd go back for again. The meals around us looked equally delicious (my wife is a particular fan of meal stalking others, afraid she might miss the better dish).  Lastly, before we got out meal, we were served with beautifully baked bread and spicy corn muffins. A real treat.  So, the downfall? Well, it's extremely noisy since it's open to the casino and you can smell the cigarette smoke lingering.  All in all, a great burger is what we came for and that was what we got....with a bonus superb margarita and bread. YUMMY!",

Tuna nachos were good but I wasn't expecting a mound of tuna tartare on a plate by itself with a small bowl of tortilla rounds on the side. That said, the flavor was very good. The NY strip steak was cooked perfectly and was seasoned same...right on the money.    The restaurant was nice, it's trendy upscale and a little pricey. Caesar's is full of upscale places but I felt like Mesa's had the flavor to back it up.",

Service is friendly and attentive and turned things over fairly quickly. The drink menu is margarita focussed so don't expect much in the way of beer or wine. The good news is that the margaritas are quite tasty. The food is really tasty with a nice level of spice but not overwhelming. The southwestern style focusses on grilled flavors and mild peppers, not super hot ones. The only problem is that the entrees don't come with sides, so you will be tacking on expensive sides at the price of a full dish other places to complete the plate. Still, it's a worthy indulgence here.",

The menu always changes but some of their popular dishes like their 16 spice chicken (meal or salad), all of their appetizers and any fish dish is prepared amazingly.  I personally don't eat red meat or the other white meat so I can't speak on those dishes.  Their bread baskets are so fresh and so good, especially their brunch bread basket.  It's to die for.  Don't leave without tasting their famous cactus pear margarita.  Enjoy!",

I've always liked Bobby Flay, and when my friends raved about Mesa Grill in Vegas, I knew I had to give this place a shot. The first thing you need to do... get a mixed drink. Their mojito is incredible, but try any of the margaritas and you won't be sorry. I have eaten here at lunch and brunch, and the shrimp tamale is outstanding. Just order it.   On our last visit we had the tuna nachos, queso, and two different egg dishes as entrees. All of it was amazing! I love that the recipes use a variety of spices and seasonings, and really, anything you get here is going to be delicious. It's Vegas, and expensive, but this is a case where you get what you pay for. Mesa Grill is an excellent dining option in Vegas!",

This visit we got the tiger shrimp tamale and split it. It has a delicious creamy sauce and the masa has corn pieces in it and a sweetness. It has 4 shrimps and this appetizer is of a size to split with one other. In the past we got Mesa Grills version of cheese dip and it is fabulous and also easily split by two. For our meal my hubby got the veal chop, it was tender and served medium and comes with a sweet corn and goat cheese tamale. He said it was better than our last visit when he got the same thing. I got the coffee rubbed filet and a side of Brussels sprouts.  My dish was cooked perfectly and I finished every bite! I can also recommend the Frenchy Drink, it's made with fresh grapefruit juice and grapefruit vodka and a Splash of cranberry and lime juice! Very refreshing!  I have been to Mesa Grill many times, as I said on every visit to Vegas and I have had most items on the menu. The pork tenderloin is also delicious but small portion and served medium so if you have issue with pink pork let them know. The eggplant stuffed relleno pepper is an unusual dish but is good for those that prefer no meat.  The 15 spice chicken is a nice size serving and is very flavorful as well as the mashed potatoes it comes with. I also can not forget the bread plate that is brought to you after your drink order. Blue cornmeal muffins are great as well as a sweeter bread with raisins and my favorite is the jalapeno bread.  It's served with soft butter.",

Mesa Grill was not kid friendly, but I should've known that. They don't really make adjustments to their dishes (less spicy, for example). Our waiter recommended the quesadilla for my 2 year old, but it was still too spicy for him. The adults had no problem devouring it though.  Had to take away one star because I did not care for their signature pork tenderloin at all.",

I have never left a review before, but read others' reviews for guidance. The quality of the food was top notch and the presentation was first class. My husband ordered the spicy loin sandwich and rated his meal five out of five. I ordered a side of the mango glazed bacon. Delicious. I also ordered the tiger prawn tamale without the tiger prawns as I don't eat shellfish. When they brought the food, the tamale came with the prawns. The waiter was apologetic and yes, mistakes happen. They fired it again but took a while to receive the correct one.  When I received it, it was a half tamale. I was starving after my meal and I'm smaller framed and don't need a lot to get full. The plate was worth $11 but charged $19. For the price charged, a full tamale would have been more appropriate. The dish was delicious but me having to eat something after my meal was disappointing. Going to go back to give them another chance but will order something different. At the end, the waiter didn't check how we liked our meal and when we asked to add points, he used the points to pay for the meal even though we had included cash plus tip. Hmm.  Decided the three stars was for everything else.",

Got the 3 course lunch special for restaurant week. Started with the duck pancake, AMAZING, tasted just like it looked, and I definitely had dreamed about it everytime I watch his show. The 2nd course was the shrimp tacos with 3 different kinds of salsa. The tacos were pretty average, but the salsas were definitely flavorful and unique each in its own way. The last course was my absolute favorite: caramel cookie and creme, crispy cookie with pecans set on top of salted caramel cream mousse. Heaven!  The service was decent, the restaurant was packed on a weekday lunch time, and I was only able to get a seat by the bar. Service was spotty, and overall lacking. The bartender was very nice, but absent. I highly recommend the food, and suggest making a reservation for dinner in the dining area.",

Enter the Brussels Sprouts Salad!  Let's start by taking a look at it... <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1kN3ySz&s=cf2e17d2ccce2d8cf973cf66d8b6f24875e46512f8cd4e5da95abf381fcfbbcf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1kN3ySz</a> Pretty, right? Shaved brussels sprouts mixed with thinly sliced gala apples and pomegranate pearls. The Spicy Tangerine Vinaigrette had some kick to it. This usually comes with goat cheese but I think it's very tasty without it. Pretty filling too and totally perfect after a night of drinking.  As for the \"life changing burger,\" I heard no complaints from our table.  Btw, the bread basket looked pretty amazing. It was filled with mini muffins and baked goods, both sweet and savory. While I didn't partake, the other ladies in the group were raving about it.",

To DIE for. We also took his wine recommendation of the 2006 Muga Riega, excellent choice- full bodied and bold enough to stand up to my Filet that was blanketed in a dry rub of coffee and smoky chipotle mixture... the steak was huge, tender and cooked perfectly medium rare. Hubby ordered the New York along with the roasted corn side.... the corn.,... yum, yum, yum...another must have. All in all, it was a fab dinner and would highly recommend it to foodies!!",

They should have been kissing the floor we walked for our business...jeez.  Anyways, onto the Pros: - white peach margarita: not too sweet, but still very tasty.  nice and tart - bread basket: the BEST bread basket I've EVER had.  complete with blue corn muffins, blueberry coffeecake, jalapeno cheddar scones, tequila scones, and some other really yummy scone thing.  they gave us plenty of each so everyone in my group had a taste of everything. - egg chilaquiles: I think I misunderstood what these are supposed to be, but regardless, the dish was amazing!  Think scrambled eggs on top of corn tostadas which were layered with white cheddar.  Everything was covered in this delicious green sauce.  The sauce was soo flavorful, I couldnt stop eating even though I was wayy to full from the bread basket and appetizer.  Cons: - goat cheese fundido:  well, not a con cause it was gooood. but nothing special.   - I had seen this mushroom quesadilla appetizer on their lunch menu online, but since we were there for brunch, they only had these other salmon quesadillas.  I asked them if they could make me a mushroom one, and they refused saying that the ingredients wouldnt have been prepared.  Maybe I'm naive about these things, but um it was 12:30...and they had all the quesadilla fixings put together for brunch anway...just add the mushrooms!!  I'm paying enough to deserve a little more flexibility.  Again, shows you how puffed up they are.  All in all, the bread basket and the chilaquiles make up for not giving me a mushroom quesadilla.",

For an app, we went with the squash blossoms which again were seasoned perfectly; a real treat.  Like most places in LV, you're going to pay through the roof for dinner which was no exception here.

So when my boyfriend and I were about to head back home from our anniversary vacation I just had to get over to Mesa Grill to try that dish, and wow.. it was so good I'm STILL thinking about it a whole 11 hours later. If you love a creamy, buttery dish full of corn and shrimp, you will be a happy person. I cleaned my whole plate. Though they only give you around 4 shrimps, you will still be happy because of the yummy sauce you can dip your complimentary bread into, and the masa, which I could seriously eat bowls of. My boyfriend ordered the blue corn pancake with bbq duck and he was very happy with it. I would definitely love to come back here again and try some more of Bobby Flay's yummy sounding dishes. I should also mention that we were seated promptly without a reservation, and our waiter was great.. knowledgeable about the menu, friendly, and helpful. Oh and the womens' bathroom smelled like watermelon. An odd observation, but I had to share.",

Ordinarily we steer away from any celebrity-named restaurant but quality was terrific as was the service. Reservations are a must. We split the blue tortilla duck and shrimp tamale appetizers, which were quite good. We both ordered the coffee-coated tenderloin, which turned out to be fork-tender and a slight but pleasant kick from the ancho sauce. Desserts were nothing to write home about; the chocolate pudding tasted like something from out of the can and the coconut cake definitely had been baked earlier in the week, frozen and then thawed for the weekend rush. We'll probably go back for a special occasion - it's a bit pricey; our waiter said Mondays tend to be the best night, less crowded. It's also very very noisy and you're elbow to elbow with the next table, very reminiscent of New York City restaurants.",

Our waiter came up every five minutes trying to take our plates, pouring water in between us and our conversations, asking questions... I understand being diligent but this was annoying.   The pork loin was the best thing any of us got. It was definitely very good. So was the shrimp tamale. I think that's actually the best thing on the menu, but quite rich so you can split that and the pork with someone and be totally satisfied as the portions are huge.  One of us had the coffee crusted steak, and the rub was just too spicy to really enjoy the meat. The fish was bland and slightly overcooked. Desserts were awful. Seriously, how hard is it to make good churros? The donuts at a fast food restaurant are better!  If you are a fan of Bobby Flay's other restaurants -- Bar Americain is one of my favorites -- you will be very disappointed here. The quality, service and atmosphere are just so mediocre it really disappoints. Oh, and the price - I think it's more expensive than eating in his restaurant in Manhattan, which is just mind-boggling because this is Vegas, for God's sake.",

Appetizers include lobster tacos, and chicken skewers to name a few, these were two apps that our table shared that were extremely delicious.  Prior to the apps arriving we got an assortment of bread and muffins complimentary of the restaurant and one of the bread choices was a jalapeno bread with warmed butter it was exceptional we asked for seconds.  The entrees were tasty and filling as well the pesto mashed potatoes, spinach, salmon, bbq chicken and tuna steak chip were all very delicious and packed with such flavor.  Prices are definitely worth the robust taste you will experience and the ambiance was very upscale yet casual.",

They have a lot of really good choices, I had heard that one of their signature dishes is supposed to be new mexican spice rubbed tenderloin and I decided to try that. It was cooked perfectly, moist and tender and it packs tons of flavor. It's a little hot but just enough and still have all the great flavors come through.  Our party ended up ordering different desserts and sharing them. We tried Blueberry Cheesecake, Banana cream pie, Chocolate Sticky Toffee pudding, Toasted coconut layer cake and carrot ice cream cake sandwhich. Out of all those, I thought the Chocolate Sticky Toffee Pudding was by far the best, one of the better desserts I've had. The Coconut cake was also good but the others were just OK.  The service was really good throughout the meal. I will definitely come back here again.",

What I got:  Blue corn buttermilk waffle with blackberry bourbon syrup - so fluffy, crispy, the best waffle I have ever tasted! The syrup is already on the waffle and I thought I wouldn't taste it (I am used to gobs of syrup on my waffles) but it was so moist and had the perfect amount.  Chorizo - Freaking holy grail! Okay so I am expecting regular chorizo, the kind that is ground up mixed with eggs. No way no how, and I never want the ground up kind again! This chorizo was grilled as a whole sausage and it had so much flavor, amazing!  Grits - These were okay, garlicky and tasty, but not as mind-blowing as the other two  The cactus ice tea came with simple syrup, along with an array of sugars which I loved!  Overall, I had rainbows coming out of my mouth after brunch, and I thought it was reasonable for Vegas prices. Meal for two ended up being about 75 (with tip).",

    "text": "Dining at Food Network Star/Iron Chef Host/Celeb Restauranteur Bobby Flay's \"Mesa Grill\" during 2014 Las Vegas Restaurant Week was such an unforgettable experience. The rave reviews are justified.  My date and I started with a sizable, complimentary bread basket filled with various artisan breads (not warm) including: cranberry bread, jalapeno bread, & jalapeno corn muffin. They had Bobby's southwestern flair and were all so fluffy, moist and scrumptious.   As our main course, we selected the Tiger Shrimp and Roasted Corn Tamale with creamy corn cilantro sauce. It's to die for! The shrimp was beyond succulent and I couldn't get enough of the creamy, dreamy sauce it was swimming in; insanely flavorful, awesomely rich. We nearly licked our plates! Well, to keep it classy, we scraped it clean with our forks.   We ended our dinner with a creamy vanilla bean flan with fresh mixed berries. The indulgent flan was silky; we were in flan heaven by the end of the evening.  What a delectable dinner from start to finish and to think, I was never really a huge follower of Bobby Flay, but his restaurant turned me into a super fan!   Elevated southwestern flavors, gorgeously modern and clean ambiance and we left feeling extremely starstruck.",

    "text": "I am big fan of Bobby Flay and every opportunity we find,  we visit Mesa Grill. Tonight, my family and I decided to go to Mesa and we called to reserve our table.  Surprisingly,  hostess offered various opening and we made our reservation at 7:30.  I did ask the hostess to please accommodate us with a table that is not sitting in the middle of other tables which makes it very uncomfortable to have  a good family time. Hostess advised she will do her best to take care of us. Upon arrival, the hostess greeted  us and asked  to follow her to our table. Sure enough she showed us our table that was in the middle of bunch of other tables . Interestingly  there was a table five feet  away and we asked the hostess to sit us at that table when she responded that table was reserved hours ago. I asked her how she  reserved that specific table when all these times that we have dined at Mesa, we were never offered any specific table. She responded that this is a very high value client.  I told her if she is not going to assist us despite many empty tables, we will go elsewhere.  She took us back to the front when the other hostess told us we have to wait another 30 minutes to get another table. At this time I wasn't in the mood to argue with her and therefore  I asked to speak to her manager. Few minutes later a tall gentlemen approaches me and tells me the same nonsense that the table I asked the hostess to accommodate  was in fact reserved weeks ago and he will do his best to give us another table. In less than 5 minutes he gives us one of the best table by the window which was far superior to the one we asked and was told it was reserved weeks in advance. Huh I reacted.  What a bunch of crap they were telling us.  The average table was reserved weeks in advance  when the best table became available in 5 minutes   Are you kidding me? Is this how you train your manager to be a bigger liar than the hostess who proclaimed that the table was reserved a few hours ago? Whose lying and whose telling the truth remain to be mystery.  I even advised the manager that Mesa Grill used to have an hour wait time and tonight being a holiday weekend,  the restaurant had no wait time with many tables empty. While the food was good and extremely over priced, perhaps the management and service destroyed our enjoyment as well as  the volume that once upon a time Mesa was producing.  Please remember  people come to dine with a family friendly and caring restaurant.  Customers don't come to $$$$ restaurant to debate a simple silly seating accommodations.  Please train your team to be customer centric before you close your doors down as the famous Olives owned by Todd English did at Belagio.",

Every aspect of our meal-drinks, bread basket, entrees-was excellent. Service was pleasant and efficient.

We decided on the blue corn duck pancake, the queso fundido, and shared the vegetarian chile relleno. The chips were delicious, as was the queso. My friend said the duck pancake was good. And our chile relleno was okaaaaaaaaay. It was definitely cheesy, and I appreciate the variation on the egg white batter with a corn meal one, but I was a bit disappointed in the texture - I'd describe it as merely \"hard\" rather than \"crunchy\", if you will. And the eggplant, which is a vegetable I love, was kinda lackluster in the mess of cheese inside. This whole dish could have used some brightening with some additional fresh salsa or something. We also shared the blueberry cheesecake, which was delicious but nothing special.  Kinda disappointed in the Flay, given how much of a pretentious A-hole he is, starring in all these \"so-I'm-the-shit-and-you-should-try-beat-me\" shows of his. A-hole.",

I ordered the green chili burger (instead of the Mesa burger which is exceptional!!! and my regular order) and a chopped salad. The green chili burger was amazing! It had pickled red onion which was just gorgeous placed on top of the green sauce! I also sampled the crab cake my mother ordered and it was of course delicious. The panna cotta was good thick texture, not too sweet and well complemented by the berries.

This was probably my favorite meal on this trip to Vegas.  They bring this basket with blueberry crumb cake, corn muffins made with blue corn, jalepeno puffs and raisin biscuits.  The coffee was strong and flavorful.  I ordered the spicy scrambled eggs with jalepenos and I believe creme fraiche on top with a side of ham.  The eggs were so fluffy and soft.  The ham was just a little sweet but was best thing on the plate.  There were more biscuits on this plate maybe buttermilk ones, very tasty.  Also got a  choice of grits or fries, I chose the grits.  They were creamy and rich. He got the pork tenderloin sandwich which they press and use cold pork tenderloin, I'm assuming the same tenderloin they may use for the dinner.  It was seasoned with New Mexican flavors, spread with a flavored mayo and topped with onions.  It also came fries.  We split each of our entrees to get more variety.  A lot of people ordered the burger around us and I must say that looked pretty tasty.  Going for brunch still gives you celebrity chef flavors for a lower price tag.",

    "text": "At the beginning i was surprise with the presentation and transformation of mexican food to the trendy concepts. We ordered Yucatan chicken skewers and unfortunately this dish did not bring even the half o the Yucatan uniqueness and tasteful cuisine. For entree we ordered ribeye with chile ancho sauce with brussels sprouts, Anaheim chile relleno and blue corn tamale, the tamale was crap!, dry and lack of flavor, the brussels sprouts as nogada style was just ok. The meat was just ok not the highest quality. The coconut flake very cheap, lack of excitement and flavor, the pumpkin bread pudding is just ok, looks more like a deconstructed s'more . Bobby Flay you really disappointed me! All the critics about your food at food network was made with people lacking in mexican cuisine experience. Thanks for using mexican food but you need to keep learning.",

    "text": "Dear Bobby,  I just wanted to let you know that Mesa Grill is no longer my favorite restaurant in LV. On my most recent visit last week in which DH dropped over $100 on dinner for two, we left unimpressed and unsatisfied with our meal. The best things I ate that night were the corn bread (free), sweet potato tamale and roasted corn (sides). Everything else was kind of an upset.  We had high hopes for the blue corn pancake appetizer, but the lackluster barbequed duck was masked by the overpowering habanero-star anise sauce. For entrees I had the New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin, which despite being huge and tender, was nothing memorable. DH had the Yucatan style grouper, which was light but bland. Where was the Southwestern bam?  There are hundreds of other nice restaurants on the strip at which we can throw our money. Next time we're taking our business to Mastro's Ocean Club. At least then we could have the novel experience of eating in a tree house.  LT",

The food was exceptional, and the service exemplary.   Instead of bread, they bring you a basket of little breads, muffins and pastries. We didn't eat all of them, but got them to give us a doggy bag for late night snacks.   The Tiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale was soooooo good I'm still dreaming about the sauces it came with. 5 star dish all the way!  We also got the Tuna \"Nachos.\" These aren't really nachos - they give you small tortilla potato chips basically you use to scoop up the raw chunks of tuna and the two sauces it comes with - a habanero sauce that wasn't too spicy and an avocado crema.  Also, we ordered the Shrimp Tacos. They were delicious - I don't know what Bobby Flay puts in those sauces (other than copious amounts of butter) but I can't get enough. The tortillas are unlike any I've had before, but they might just be the most perfect tortillas ever - soft and strong so that they don't fall apart.   Will be back for the Mesa Burger next time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "After Food Trucks became trendy in 2010, people loved all things fusion.  Craziness persisted.  We saw stuff like sushi in burritos, we saw french fries with kimchi, and we saw bacon in everything.  Before the craze, chefs like Bobby Flay and David Chang established their names with their creative fusion blends.  Just because foods are creative doesn't mean that they'll be good.  One of the problems with fusion foods is that they tend to be one dimensional.  They're usually spicy or tangy or sweet or bacon-infused to the MAX.       You gain an appreciation for this place as soon as you try one of their dishes.  Take their popular \"blue corn pancake\", for instance.  It looks simple:  you have a thin blue cornmeal crepe and it's filled with barbecue duck.  You take a bite and you notice the sweet notes of the barbeque sauce.  That taste fades and you then notice the tender duck meat.  The dish is small, so it forces you to eat slowly to make it last.   As you chew slowly, the subtle, nutty heat of the habanero sauce begins to rise.       Flay's appetizers are full of flavors that are distinct without being over-the-top.    When I came here for my birthday dinner with my girlfriend, we opted to sample several appetizer instead of choosing one main course.  We knew that it would be the best way to get a good mix of flavors.    You can't miss the roasted garlic tamales with tiger shrimp.  It was a favorite of my girlfriend.  The chef said that it is the most popular appetizer and that the recipe has not changed in twenty years.  My favorite side dish was their roasted corn.  It reminded me of ordering corn at a park in East LA.   You get the flavors of lime, garlic, white corn, various cheeses.  It's great street food, but improved upon.  But their sweet potatoes are good too.  It's served au gratin.  It's creamy - it's very evident that they used a lot of cream here.  But it also has interesting spice that reminded me of pumpkin pie.   It's a nice, flavorful starch to complement their popular pork tenderloin or coffee-rubbed steak.  This is fusion done well.  Its flavor pops in three dimensions, but without the need of glasses.",

    "text": "Oh Bobby Flay, how I love thee!!! lol!  So with that in mind, there was little I would've disliked. I came in with high expectations and expected to pay out the A-hole for a 5-Star dinner.   Did I mention I'm probably the biggest Flay fan out there? My boyfriend too.... seriously - waiting on the Flay channel.   Anyhow, we were alarmed we were able to get reservations on a Saturday night easily, but we made them the night before and I was stoked.   We arrived on time, table wasn't ready so we posted at the bar - cute little bar, quirky little bartender, stiff vodka tonics (LIKE!)  Naturally, since we stalk Bobby, lol, we asked if he was coming in, but to our dismay he was not (sad face)  We were seated within 10 minutes of arriving. Cute little intimate tables, we examined our neighbors cuisine as it came in - immediately wondering if we could buy real estate in LV. lol... yummmm  We ordered Tuna Nachos for antipasto; it came quickly, so did the bread selection. I remember loving the jalepeno bread because it was different, but really it was kind of crappy bread. Bobby, we love you but stop baking - it's not your style. Tortilla's, chips, or maybe some other SW app would've fit.   Tuna nacho's were ok; the oil trio's at the base for garnish were really REALLY good... I would've been happy just eating that.   Boyfriend ordered the side of cow... the most massive piece of beef I've seen. I think it was a Rib Eye Steak (Alton Brown's fav cut), he loved it, and didn't have to pick out much fat. Kinda weird there was no sides with it, but then again it would've gone to waste with my bf anyhow.   I got the braised lamb. Huge cuts, and it came with a brick nasty tamale. It was not a tamale - and WHY would you use corn husks Bobby?? Why?? Use Banana Leaves... so much better. My bf's tia can show you... just let us come visit ;)  Anyhow, it was a great experience, our waiter was nice, the restaurant was nice, and after all that food and four drinks total we were expecting to pay $250+ but to our delightful suprise it was $110 with tax. WOW.   Bobby Flay your the best. Oh and your wife is a good actress too.",

I was under the impression that it was going to be a little more formal than it was. There wasn't anything extravagant about the interior, very simple. Sadly, we have been drinking the whole day and wasn't really hungry from the really late lunch we had.  We ordered the smoked chicken quesadilla and wasn't too amazed. You can definitely skip this appetizer. We then got the Blue Corn Lobster Tacos which was full of flavor and very good! A definite appetizer to get.  Due to us not being too hungry we ordered the crusted Tuna Steak. The tuna was delicious but it too wasn't something we would order again. I think we might of just ordered the wrong plates because a 9 year old boy ordered the rib eye and his dad got the NY strip steak and it looked AMAZING. The lady to my left ordered the cioppino and that too looked AMAZING.  I definitely want to check out the NY location for their brunch menu that they are well known for and try out Bobby Flay's food again... when I am not so full. Till then...",

    "text": "My 200th review! Wow, who knew I ate out so much!! For #200 I have chosen Mesa Grill. I am torn on giving 4 stars...but I don't want to give 3 either...let's say 3 1/2 stars for Mesa.   The service was definitely 5 stars. We had an awesome, attentive, friendly, sweet waiter who really did an awesome job. The restaurant is clean and nicely decorated. The table was large and the seating was comfortable.   When it comes to the food though...I just wasn't that impressed :( I had really high hopes for Mesa...I have heard so many people tell me how much they love it and how it will be some of the best food I will ever eat. I beg to differ.  Let me break it down, we had a LOT of food, so I feel like me giving 3 stars for food is justified:  Appetizers - Goat Cheese \"Queso Fundido\", Tiger Shrimp & Roasted Corn Tamale, Blue Corn Pancake with Duck, Yucatan Chicken Tacos.   We ordered four appetizers for five people. That should be enough, right? Wrong. These appetizers are tiny. And expensive for the portion you receive! The total for just the appetizers was $60. Yes, 6-0 dollars. One appetizer was barely enough for two people. And let me state for the record, I have no problem throwing down money for good food, but I thought it was absolutely ridiculous the amount charged for tiny little bites of food.  But how did it taste, you ask? Okay. The cheese dip was awesome. I will give Mr. Flay that - he can make a mean cheese dip. But, if you didn't eat it fast enough, it hardened. So, eat quickly when you order the queso! The shrimp tamale was also pretty good. The shrimp were large and juicy, the corn filling was nice and flavorful, which a yummy cilantro cream sauce. The blue pancake with duck was alright...I wouldn't eat it again. It was shredded duck in a super rich BBQ sauce, just okay. The chicken tacos were served with red onions and \"chile BBQ sauce\" that tasted just like Thai food...pad thai to be exact.   Sides - Glazed Baby Carrots with brown sugar, Roasted Corn with smoked chile's and Cotija cheese, Sauteed Spinach, Sweet Potato Tamale with Pecan Butter.  I tried all of these sides. This place is like Ruth's Chris where you order your meat, and everything else on the side, your entree doesn't come with anything.  The baby carrots had a nice flavor, but they were a little undercooked for my taste. I prefer softer carrots. The sweet potato tamale with pecan butter - sounds awesome right? Sounds sweet and delicious, right? Well, it tastes like Masa. The sauteed spinach was literally just that. Spinach. Now, I love spinach, and I can eat it plain or dressed up, but when I pay $8 for spinach, I would expect some garlic, or salt...or anything...nope. This was seriously cooked spinach with no other flavors.   The Roasted Corn was the star of the sides. It was absolutely delicious. The corn kernels were crisp and fresh, served in an awesome creamy, cheesy sauce that was spicy, but not too overpowering. Just awesome.   Entrees - Coffee Rubbed Filet MIgnon, Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin.  Three of us had the filet, the other two had the pork. Since I can't eat pork, I don't want to say much about it, but I will say BF said it was good, but not the best ever. Maybe if he ever gets on the ball and starts Yelping again, he can tell you about it himself.  The filet...very large cut of meat, too much to finish. It was soft, it was coffee rubbed, it didn't really taste like anything. The coffee rub was more of a burnt crust. I got a hint of coffee, but mostly I just tasted burn.   It was served on some mushroom, ancho chile sauce. The mushrooms were very good. Spicy and caramelized. I loved the sauce...but the filet? I would rather go to Ruth's Chris. honestly.  After dinner our friends ordered dessert and coffee. I tried the coffee, good flavor. I took a bite of their Pineapple Buttermilk Upside Down Cake - it was very good, rich, sweet, served with a caramelized rum sauce.   Overall, this place was just alright. There were a few things that hit high notes with me, but they were appetizers and sides, and I don't think I would come back just for those items. The majority of the food was just okay, not amazing, not the best I have ever had.   I think I will just stick to making my Bobby Flay recipes at home, they taste better and they are cheaper!",

    "text": "My fiance and I decided to try out Mesa Grill on Valentine's Day, and we were extremely pleased with everything!   SERVICE: Our waiter was friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. He made sure our food tasted great and our glasses were always full. Although the restaurant was busy and our server was waiting on several guests, he made an appearance every few minutes.   FOOD: The food was excellent! I highly recommend the tiger shrimp tamale appetizer. Honestly, I would come back just for that dish and dessert. Our entrees were also delicious--I had the grilled mahi mahi and my fiance had the chile relleno. Both were prepared well, though, we thought the prices were a bit high for the portion sizes (most items are served a la carte).  HOWEVER, if you're eating at a restaurant on the strip, it's to be expected, so I'm not complaining too much. And, the absolute highlight of the meal was the dessert. We ordered the chocolate cajeta cake. Don't let the rather simple description on the menu fool you. This cake is absolutely amazing! It's served warm and covered in a rich caramel sauce with a crispy chocolate topping. If you like chocolate, you can't miss out on this dessert!",

A nice cup of smooth coffee had me bright eyed and ready to go and see a show afterwards.  Service was quick, careful and friendly.  The atmosphere is light and open and full of people.  Not particularly expensive.  Come to Caesars and hit this place up, you'll be glad you did.  The best Vegas celeb chef restaurant,  Bobby Flay you're the man.",

The shrimp tamales with corn is my favorite appetizer! Tender shrimp with sweet corn and the masa is a great combination! The duck appetizer is also awesome. It has a nice glaze that mixes well with the meaty duck! I like to order the salmon for my main course. It's cooked just right with light sauce. The black widow mojito was nice and strong! Bobby Flay knows good food!!",

    "text": "i was extremely disappointed with my experience here - and this is coming from someone who has eaten here before and enjoyed it back then (albeit, that was 7 years ago...).   the menu selection was minimal - barely two pages to cover the entire menu of drinks, starters, entrees, and desserts. i barely found anything i wanted to eat with such few items to choose from. however, i was there with a group for a birthday so i had to find *something* and be quiet about it. i decided to get a soup and an appetizer and eat them both as my meal.  unfortunately, however, i did not end up eating any of the food that was brought to me.  (1) the corn soup i received was cold the first time it arrived, so i sent it back for a warm one. however, it was overly sweet and tasted more like a dessert soup than a starter. it was also too spicy, i would have preferred a milder soup that allowed the natural sweetness of the corn to shine.  (2) i also had a smoked chicken quesadilla that was SO overly smoked that i thought i was eating pork. the chicken was also overcooked and dry. i took two bites and left the rest.  (3) finally, i got the peach mojoto which must have been 4 parts sugar to 1 part mojito. it was like drinking pure cane syrup.  i will not be returning here, and i will not be recommending it to any of my friends, either. my share of the dinner was $50 and i had two spoon fulls of soup, two bites of quesadilla, and a sip of mojito. such a waste...  i'm giving two stars instead of one because our server was a very nice lady, and she made sure our party of 8 was tended to regularly.",

    "text": "The boy is a huge Bobby Flay fan, so he picked Mesa Grill as our \"fine dining\" destination on this most recent trip to Vegas.  I had heard some good things, and some not so good things so I tried to go in with no expectations.  We were running really late for our 8:30pm ressies and they have a $100 ($50/each) no show charge. So I called to move the reservation to 10:30pm and they were very helpful. I was really grateful that it wasn't an issue.  We were a little early and had to wait a few minutes for a table. No big deal since like I said, we were a bit early, but the hostess was just sort of unfriendly. Like you could tell she really didn't like her job all that much.  We were finally seated and placed our orders. We both had the Lamb Chops, which were served with a cranberry sauce along with a pumpkin tamale. The lamb chops were amazing. Perfectly cooked, HUGE and flavorful. The boy also loved the tamale - me notsomuch. I thought it was dry and overwhelmingly flavored with cinnamon. I thought it could have been much more subtle.  The service was good, but did lag a couple of times. Drink orders were forgotten and we had to flag our server down to get our check. But she was incredibly friendly and didn't seem to mind that we weren't going to order 3 courses and just wanted to get in and out.  I give Mesa +3 for wonderful service and making my life much less stressful when I needed to move my reservations. +1 for a really excellent Lamb Chop and for living up to (at least) my boyfriend's expectations. -1 for being a little overpriced, but it is Vegas, so I should probably expect it.  Would I go back to Mesa on another trip? Probably not. There are way too many awesome restaurants to try. Am I glad I tried it once? Hell yeah!",

I guess even in Illinois, they've heard of Bobby Flay. ;) They couldn't wait to text their friends back home that they were eating at his restaurant... and what do all three order? The double cheddar cheeseburger. God love them.   Since it was a Sunday, they served Brunch. I was a little disappointed because I was hoping to order my favorite duck tamale with habenero sauce, but it wasn't meant to be. Instead, I opted for the ancho-chili citrus glazed Salmon with black bean sauce over sauteed spinach.   Let me tell you guys, when that entree was served... I felt like an judge on Iron Chef. I wanted to tell Bobby that the salmon reminded me the mountains that surrounds Vegas valley and the different, beautiful colors, lime green, hot orange, black and white swirls was a like a desert sunset painting. My first taste was like a dream...and soon that lovely painting on my plate was gone!",

The drinks are great too definitely try the Spicy Bloody Mary and the fresh squeezed juices.   Having reservations really helped since we got seated right away and there was a pretty long wait.

I warned her not to fall prey to the celebrity mind-meld, but she would not listen.  Like any dutiful mindless star-gazer, wifey did some cursory research and discovered that Mesa Grill has become one of the most popular restaurants in New York.  Even worse, this rapidly spreading McDonald's-like chain restaurant has spawned another hell-child in Las Vegas...  Caesar's Palace, no less.  Oh how I mourn for America's diners! Star-struck wifey soon made a reservation to this culinary monstrisity hoping to see Chef Flay and his blindingly pasty complexion.    Spicy chicken and sweet potato hash with poached egg... not exactly an earth-shattering combination.  The mahi mahi didn't whet our whistle either.  Don't think that I'm just slaggin' on Chef Flay's cooking because I'm biased.  After tasting his Southwest fusion style, wifey wasn't exactly star-struck anymore.  Sorry Mr. Flay, but your pale as a ghost white complexion and \"aw-shucks\" dimpled-face couldn't save this meal.  Only the service saved this review from the dreaded Yelp 2-star kiss o' death.",

I ordered the honey glazed salmon, Jeff ordered Pineapple glazed Mahi-Mahi (which was to die for!), Liz ordered the most amazing and interesting dish; Chilaquiles with eggs and tomatillo creme sauce.  Oh my gawd! I have never had chilaquiles THAT GOOD.   The bread they served was heavenly. Jalapeno laced corn bread and tiny jalapeno bread bites. Man!!!   I also had a cactus pear iced tea...

    "text": "Looks like I'm the minority reviewer with a lower rating here... but it just wasn't anything special (for the price).  We came here for lunch, so I really do not know about dinner.  Here is the rundown:  First off... the menu is very limited.  I really expected more of a selection.  Points off there.  For the app, we had the queso which was really good.  Great mixture of cheeses.  There were not enough of the blue corn chips though.  Come on Bobby... for another penny or two throw a few more of those on the plate!  For lunch, the pork tenderloin sandwich was very good.  The panini style sandwich was crispy, and the spices were perfect and the pork was tender.  The only real downside was the size... not too much filling the sandwich.  The southwestern fries that came with it were not very good at all... more points off.  Some were soggy and/or oily, and the seasoning was just meh.  Points could have been added if a good dipping sauce came with it.  I stole my buddies horseradish mustard to use.  Service was very good overall with a few flaws.  We did not get the basket of bread until half way through our meal, and they were a bit slow on the response when we needed something.  Otherwise our waiter did a good job and was attentive.  The major points off here are for the price.  It simply was not worth the money.  For 2 burgers, 1 pork sandwich, 1 app and regular drinks... the bill was very close to $100 with tax and tip.  My good was decent with flaws, and the burger was nothing special either (although good).  Do yourself a favor...if you want selection and a decent cost, try somewhere else.",

    "text": "Best bread basket ever.  I'm not a bread person at all, and I tend to ignore the rolls that restaurants usually put out with meals, but I would go back to Mesa just for the bread.  There was an herb and asiago and a corn and chile muffin that were just incredible.  The herb and asiago was subtle but not overly so, with just the right amount of cheesiness, and the corn muffin - oh my goodness.  First of all, beautiful - the color of the chiles comes through in a red swirl that makes an appetizing contrast with the dark gold of the muffin.  Texture is spot on - soft and warm and crumbly but not dry, and when you bite into it you find whole kernels of corn tucked inside that really add a little extra.  And of course, it tastes wonderful.  The chiles really give it the perfect kick - I cannot imagine a better corn muffin.  Needless to say, but my friend and I polished off our bread basket in no time and the thoughtful waiter noticed us picking at crumbs and brought us a second.  Uh...so I just spent a significant fraction of my life talking about the BREAD at this place.  It was just so impressive, and I had high expectations for the rest of the meal.  Amazingly, they were not disappointed!  After devouring the second bread basket sans mercy, we ordered a ceviche sampler to start.  The sampler was very pretty, with four square plates each holding spoons topped with tiny tiny tiny little mounds of various ceviches.  Each ceviche had a different flavor to it, and they were all quite good, and we managed to share through some surgical utensil usage.  This was probably the least memorable course, if only because there just wasn't enough tasting to get acquainted, but still superb.  For our entrees I ordered the pan-seared halibut and my friend ordered the chile relleno.  I think I had the better entree, but both were fantastic.  The chile was a thing of beauty, huge and crusted in cornmeal, sitting on a little pool of colorful sauces.  I tried a few bites and it was goooood.  My halibut was heavenly.  The fish was perfectly cooked, and the sauce was incredible!  The flavor was really deep and rich, almost like a zesty barbecue, and it worked magically with the mild fish.  Sweet red onions were also a nice touch.  This being our last night in Vegas, we weren't about to skip dessert, and we ordered a fresh berry tart with strawberry creme fraiche ice cream and an empanada with peach, mango, and cream cheese filling with a white peach tequila sorbet.  (Seriously, how do you see that described on the menu and not order it?)  Both were exceptional.  The tart was one of the best fruit tarts I've ever had.  It came on a gorgeous puff pastry that was perfect with the fruit and the custard filling.  The strawberry creme fraiche ice cream was light and delicious.  The empanada was like nothing else I've ever eaten, and all those components actually work together like a dream.  And yeah, the place is pretty.  I especially appreciate the colorful decor because of how well it reflects the beautiful colors in the food.  Service is also fabulous.  Pricing - it's expensive, but not overly so.  I'd say the value is great.  And it's Vegas!  I would much rather drop $70 on a meal like this than on a few bad blackjack hands.  To wrap up a rather lengthy and worshipful review - I would go back to Mesa faster than you can say corn muffin.",

The sweet potato tamale was heavenly, although next time I'll get more pecan butter.  My mom got the rib eye without all the sauces and it was one of the tastiest pieces of beef I've ever had.  It was much better than the flavorless filet my dad had, but then if you're looking for a tasty piece of cow, you don't order filet.  I also loved the blue corn muffin and the prickly pear iced tea.    The rest of my family had tickets to see Bette Middler, conveniently located just feet from Mesa Grill, so we didn't have time for appetizers or desserts.  It hurts me to think about what I missed, but I take comfort in the fact that while they were watching Ms. Middler sing her heart out, I was in my hotel room eating their leftovers.  update- I just got the Mesa Grill cookbook from Costco.  It's that good.  I'll be heading back to Vegas just to eat there and see O.",

I bow to his domination of southwestern cuisine and his ability to harness all of its great flavors.    Came to Mesa Grill for brunch and the Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash with Poached Egg.  All the many flavors blended so well into a spicy hot sweet twist on an eggs benedict which left you wanting more.  I also had a large chunk of the Mesa Burger (thanks Michelle T.) which was a ginormous piece of meat perfectly cooked w/ a nice pinkish hue.          The Spicy Bloody Mary was the best I've ever had.  You can tell this \"wake-me-up\" concoction was all muddled from fresh ingredients because...  it just tasted sooo good especially after a late night of gambling and drinking.  The cornucopia of corn breads are to die for (all free w/ meal).  From corn cranberry currant scones to savory jalapeno, sweet pepper, onion breads.  A \"wow\" is the most fitting word to describe.  If you go to Vegas and don't eat at Mesa... you never really went to Vegas (period)  ***Thank you Lauren B. for being the \"purveyor of fine foods on Yelp!\"***",

They gave me a knife to cut it...I didn't need it. Perfectly cooked.  3: Tiger Shrimp Tamale - Again, believe the reviews. It's as good as everyone says and the positive reviews are earned.  4: Brussel Sprouts w/ Roasted Pecans: Never had anything like it, loved it.  5: Toffee Pudding - OMG! Definitely one order to share, it looks small but it packs a delicious punch.  6: Coconut Cake - Just writing this and thinking of it made me crave it again.  7: Service - Once seated it reset my definition of how it's done. 8: Wine: We let the staff pick...they listened and their choices just sent our experience from good to over the top great.  9: Gala Apple Salad - Don't let the goat cheese scare you away from this wonderful appetizer.   Cons:  Decor: I expected so much better. The colored dots on the glass were stickers. The multicolored glass containers above the bar...looked like cheap plastic up close.  Attention to Detail: Chipped Plates. Seriously. In a restaurant like Mesa this was unacceptable.  Service: The staff at the Front Counter seemed a bit clueless and lost. Complete opposite experience of the over the top service we had once we were seated.  Space: Looks like Harrah's / Caesar's Palace is trying to extract maximum revenue per square foot with tables that are very tightly spaced. If anyone in your party is claustrophobic or more than average sized, this will not be a positive experience for them.  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale - Kind of a letdown, but fortunately the other menu items more than offset this slightly bland disappointment.   Pricing: Bring Ben and make sure he's got a twin when you pay and tip appropriately. And we won't even discuss the tab if you really explore the bar.  Would we go back? In a heartbeat. If I didn't have so many cons I'd give that 5th star, but 4 will have to suffice.   One other thing: Caesars's Valet Parking was \"Full\" but explaining we were late for our reservations and a generous tip took care of the parking. Needless to say we tipped them again on the way out because they the valet staff took great care of us.",

He should be grateful he's never met me in person.  But, when going on a celebrity chef tour, you can't reject Bobby Flay. This is the greatest excuse for me to talk shit. We walked in and his books with all his smiles welcomed us. Yes, buy my books before you sit down.   The interior is nice and fiery, a visual representation of what he wants his food to be. It's all good and all, but what the hell is up with the bar being a completely different color scheme and even art style that clashes so horribly with the rest of the place? Another freshly graduated interior designer, it seems.   \"MESA\" is the big name you see no matter where you're sitting, in an oddly half-cut big block lettering. Nick commented \"I wonder if anyone told Bobby that half his letters are missing.\" The logo makes no sense with the interior design either, all of which just says to me \"failure\".  I did not keep the receipt but I still remember a good part of the meal.  Tiger shrimp tamales, an appetizer, is an absolute must in trying Bobby's food. It is an absolute must because he always makes it. So you have to eat it, because it is his signature dish. Obviously it is his favorite, so he better do this right. And it is good. I'd hate to say it, but it's a well-made tamale. Sure not exactly Mexican, but it tastes pretty good. It had all of two shrimps. A spicy mayo sauce is gooped onto it.   A ceviche turned out to be leftover bits of grouper fish tossed in lemon juice. The fish was nice and fresh, but that ain't ceviche.   Two different fish dishes were decent, good ingredients prepared by good workers. Such a pitiful thing that Bobby does is overpower everything by drowning them in sauces. You don't really taste the meat, you taste the sauce. And Tony Bourdain was right. You can tell all too easily that the sauces came out of squeeze bottles. And before then they came out of blenders. Something... that just kills the cooking essense of cooking.  The dessert was at least very good, worth going to Bobby's for. Warm chocolate crepes with strawberries, with plenty of warm goopy sauce around it.  The best part of the meal, and I've had too many experiences like this at \"fine dining\" places, was the free bread that was passed around. Corn bread with actual corn chunks (to remind you that you're eating corn bread), was a bit more crumbly than I would like (it just means crumbs everywhere!!) but it did have the corn flavor goodness. With warm butter (although that made it crumblier) it was better.  I watched a steak being served to another table, and the load of peppers and sauce on top of it made me cringe. As we left the books bid us farewell.",

Others in our group had the goat cheese fundido, chicken and black bean quesadilla, the blue corn pancake with duck (first time trying duck and they loved it!) NY strip (amazing flavor and spice), pork tenderloin (a little pink for my liking, but my husband couldn't get enough of it), and for dessert we split the churros and the sticky toffee pudding. I could eat the \"pudding\" all day long - incredible!! It's more like a dense and uber moist cake smothered in toffee sauce. They also have a tequila crema that we've been searching for since we tried it in Mexico - a tequila version of Baileys! Reservations beyond recommended",

    "text": "restaurant week at mesa grill.  my husband and i dined here a few years ago. this past week, we opted for the restaurant week lunch menu. we started off with the sweet potato soup and tamale. both were very good. it was a tie for me, but my husband liked the tamale better. the soup was spicy and creamy, i really enjoyed it.  between the green chili burger and the pork tenderloin sandwich, the winner was the tenderloin. it was a little messy but reminded me a little of a ban mi sandwich. the fries accompanying the sandwiches were crispy. and we finished the meal with a key lime sorbet. it was way too tart for me, but a good pallet cleanser.  each time my husband has ordered the black widow mojito. very refreshing, but very expensive. next time we're in vegas, we'll stop by and try dinner.",

    "text": "I don't know why, but I'd always been reluctant to try this place.    Maybe it's because it's so close to the casino floor?   Maybe it's the bright colors?   Maybe because I kept thinking it was a Mexican restaurant, realize it wasn't when I actually *was* looking for a Mexican restaurant, and it just wasn't on my radar for steaks/meat?   Maybe because it's sort of in no man's land where it's too expensive for a casual meal and not really in the upper tier of fine dining restaurants on the strip?    Regardless, I finally got around to trying Mesa when it was a friend's choice for dinner.    Took a little hunting to find something that really stuck out on the menu to me.  No doubt it's just personal preference, but quite a few items on the menu seemed to have polarizing experiments, meaning they'd start off sounding great before having a deal breaker ingredient I don't care for.  I'm not usually a fan of substitutions or trying to alter a chef's creation.    When I did finally decide on my meal, it was very good.  Much better than I was expecting.  Portions are on the smaller side though, and I wouldn't put Mesa in the top tier of restaurants on the strip.    3.5 stars rounded up from me.",

The quesadillas stuffed with cheese and bacon with an egg on top, tasted like something I could make at home. Then there was this dish that had steak, tortillas, guacamole and scrambled eggs. All of them were well prepared, but nothing different to make it stand out to match the price they charged for it.  The only thing I could not make at home was the tiger shrimp with tamales. That one had the wow factor and the uniqueness to justify the price. Reminded me of shrimp and grits with tamales in place of grits.  The side of mango-glazed bacon was not crispy. Bacon that is not crispy is simply wrong.  Overall verdict: very good, but bang for buck ratio might be on the \"loss\" column for brunch. I recommend maybe coming for the dinner menu.",

I had the caesar's salad, blue corn tamale, and rabbit.  My wife had a blue corn tamale and the only chicken dish on the menu.  The meal started with a basket of 3 different breads.  The jalapeno cheese bread and the date rasin bread were wonderful.  The corn muffin on the other hand was fairly bland and very dry.  The caesar's salad has warm crutons, made from hominy that had a wonderful crunchy shell around a sweet soft inside, with chorizo slices and parmasian cheese crisps.  Wonderful.  My wife and I loved the blue corn tamales.  They were served in a tied husk, had a great texture, and wonderful flavor.  The only chicken dish was too spicy for my wife.  She said the flavor was good but very spicy.  As I said, I had the rabbit.  I loved it.  It had a crusty outside and was cooked and seasoned perfectly.",

I was really impressed by the menu and creativity of some of the dishes. I'm a big enough food network fan to know of Bobby Flay's reputation and his specialties. The lunch/brunch menu I felt was a little light- not as many lunch options as I would have liked. I had the green chili cheeseburger, knowing that BF rocks burgers. It was super delicious and one of the most melt in your mouth burgers I've ever had. Everyone I was with also enjoyed their meal. My favorite part of the meal was the bread/pastry basket. Not only did we get bread, but also jalapeno biscuits, blueberry scones, and chocolate muffins! Never have I experienced a bread basket quite so wonderful.   Service was great, but the ambiance was lacking. I'm not sure if it was because we were there for lunch, but it just seemed kind of bland and dull. Not too busy and not quite the scene would imagine for a BF restaurant. All in all, great burger though.",

We both had a couple drinks...traditional margaritas and prickly pear margaritas, again, both perfect.  I love this place. The flavors are unbelievable. Now of course I know that is a matter of opinion because not everyone likes the same flavors, but I will say this and this is not opinion. Everything is prepared to perfection.

    "text": "Arrived at Mesa around 2 pm on a Saturday and was greeted by a rather unimpressive \"brunch\" menu.  Three of us started off with the salmon nachos as an appetizer and we quickly realized a mistake had been made.  The \"nachos\" consisted of maybe 4 ounces of salmon tartar with a two ounce serving of tortilla chips.  This would have not been a problem if the dish had not called salmon nachos.  Had it been called \"salmon tartare with tortilla chips\" we could have passed and saved the $20.  Go anywhere and order nachos, and you will be greeted by a giant pile of chips topped with goodies, just not at Mesa.   Then came the burger.  I'm not hard to please, trust me, but this burger was a 3 out of 10 at best, and the \"southwest fries\" were 2 out of 10.  The burger was heavily spiced pre cooking, thus leaving a crusted outer coating that was unappealing.  From what I could tell, there really wasn't a sauce on the bun and the whole burger just felt like it was missing something.  The fries were pretty basic and over coated in seasoned salt.  Worse yet, the dish came with a side of dijon mustard that neither complimented the burger or the fries.   There were some pluses to the meal.  We received a nice basket of mixed breads to start the meal.  The one issue with the bread was that some were sweet breakfast breads and some were savory jalapeno breads and some were a mystery.  Not knowing whether a bread is going to be sweet or spicy can be a little frustrating to the palate.  Our server was also nice.   In the end, I finally made it to a restaurant that had been on my to-do list for many years and my party and I left extremely unsatisfied.  $117 for a burger, 2 ounces of nachos, a couple tacos and a piece of fish, next time we will pass.",

Cooked perfectly medium rare and bursting with flavor.  I originally said no to the house bread basket but the couple next to be insisted I get it.  Good advice.  Its an assortment of different breads, but the one the stuck out the most to me was the blue corn muffin.  All in all I was impressed. Service was prompt and the price reasonable considering the name and location of this place.",

    "text": "I had previously dined at Mesa grill years ago and remember enjoying it so decided to return for lunch. Had smoked salmon club and spiced pork sandwich. Also had a cactus pear margarita. Everything that I had was very good with lots of flavor. Both sandwiches were excellent with good amount of meat to each sandwich. Perfect toast to the bread and sandwiches were both dressed well.  Probably prefer the smoked salmon club, but just a matter of personal preference as each sandwich was done well. I do think the fries that came with the sandwiches were weak component of meal as they were not crisp.  May have been a matter of them sitting on warming tray or perhaps is consequence of the basket that was used as serving dish that did not allow them to breathe.  They were however, well-seasoned w/ some sort of Southwestern spice mix.  The margarita was refreshing but not exactly a bargain at 15 bucks.  I guess thats what happens in Vegas.  All in all, it was a great lunch and I will go back again next time I'm in Vegas.  If they can fix the fries then it would be 5 stars.",

Atmosphere: Dressy and very contemporary. An open floor means you will be seen, or for a show, check out the open-kitchen, a sight to see if you enjoy watching the intricacies of a gourmet kitchen!   Service: Prompt, courteous, knowledgeable, and very attentive.   Food: First course: Goat cheese \"Queso Fundido\", this gourmet spin on the classic nacho cheese dip was an excellent starter to the Southwest-themed main course. Excellent flavor and spice and just the right amount of tang from the goat cheese. For the main course I selected the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin, these medallions were cooked medium rare and had a melt in your mouth taste that are too numerous for words. The sauce added just the right amount of heat, for a side I selected the roasted corn that had all the right combination of sweet, spicy, and a creamy texture that was good to the last bite and worth the visit alone!",

For appetizer, they give you a complimentary bread basket.  There was more than one type of bread.  I really enjoyed the jalapeno biscuit.  We ordered the bacon potato quesadilla - and oh my gosh...  It was like a party in my mouth.    For my dish, I ordered the chilaquilles, which was absolutely amazing!  It's one of those things in life you have to eat before you die.  It really was that good.  The service was excellent.  The staff is amazing.  If you bring your own water bottle, they'll offer to pour it for you in their glasses.  Who does that?  Mesa Grill - that's whom.  I almost forgot, everytime you are done with a dish, they clean up your area and give you new plates and a new set of forks and knives.    I swear I just died and gone to heaven!  Next time you're at the Caesar's Palace in Vegas, don't forget to visit Mesa Grill.",

Mario Batali's B&B Restuarante, Wolfgang Puck's Spago, and of course Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill.  I have to say, Mesa Grill was such a let down. You made me so sad Bobby Flay! What happened to Boy Meets Grill? Because, let me tell you, your burger was whack!  I got the Prix Fix Lunch ($29), which included 3 entrees (blue corn pancakes w/ duck, buffalo burger, and ice cream/cream puff). Gah! That burger was straight up dry and bland! The patty was massive, and I mean thick, it had to have been an inch thick! The thing is, I love my meat, but seriously, there's only so much dry hamburger meat a girl can eat.  So the burger was whack, but the chile relleno ($16) was off the hook! However, paying almost $20 for a chile relleno is ridunkulous! Our bill came out to about $60 with tax/tip for lunch, which I have to say is really steap!  So overally, Mesa Grill was a major let down.",

    "text": "Went to Mesa for a father's day dinner. Party of five and we weren't too too dressed up.  We came in from shopping from the Ceasar's forum and we just had on jeans and casual tops.  They had no problem taking us in without a reservation and seated us within 10 min of arriving.  It had a nice ambiance and not at all pretentious. Between the five of us we ordered:  dad- 22oz bone-in chipotle glazed ribeye   mom- new mexican spiced rubbed pork tenderloin with tamale  bro- wild mushroom qusadilla with white truffle oil (appetizer)  hubby- mango + spice crusted tuna steak with taosted pine nuts cous                 cous  me- blue corn pancake: barbecued duck + habanero chile + anise            (appetizer)  The food arrived after 15-20 min. and meanwhile our server gave us a basket full of bread that had blue and yellow corn muffins, jalapeno bread and raisin and walnut bread.  The bread was ok and my dad and I thought the corn muffin seemed to tase a little bit like seafood flavor. The food arrived and I we all took a taste of each other's food.  For me the clear winner is the ribeye, it was very tender, juicy, very flavorful and my dad ate it all but the bone.  My mom's pork tenderloin was very flavorful and tha tamale was delish.  My hubby's tuna was cooked to perfection, it tasted fresh with no hint of fishines to it. The cous cous that came with it had a good sauce with it and went well with the tuna. My bro's qusadilla was a good size and the mushrooms in it was very tasty.  My own duck pancake was also very good.  I couldn't tell the meat in it was duck, it also could have been chicken but the sauce that it came in was delicious.   All in all the food was great, ambiance was lovely, and service was aaah maybe a 3.  Our waiter was good but his assistant ruined it for me.  He spilled coffee on me when he poured my second cup and got it on my arm.  When he offered to give me coffee to go, he took 10 min.. maybe longer, to tell me that they didn't have any cups.   The meal was good so I guess the last instances shouldn't really be blamed on the whole establishment so I still give this restaurant high markings. Will we come back again?  Maybe not.  There just too many great restaurants to try in Las Vegas and I have my eyes set on Bradley Ogden next.",

    "text": "I'll admit it, I don't like the guy. So when I was told dinner would be here, wasn't particularly impressed to begin with. The food confirmed most of what I thought about Flay. There are moments of food brilliance overshadowed by the notion that whatever is plated is great.   First off, the good.   The prawn and corn tamales which haven't been removed from the menu since opening are wonderful. Very rich, corny, and the prawns cooked absolutely perfectly. One of the better tamales I've had whether or not you like traditional or more fusion type. The blue corn muffins were good, as was the accompanying ciabatta and cranberry breads.   The sixteen spice chicken was good and spicy. Fairly juicy as well. The accompanying tamale was very good. The side tamales all seemed to be done nicely. The steaks were decent, though not spectacular. Each was cooked exactly as ordered, not an easy feat.   The desserts were wonderful. Amongst the group, we basically got the sampler which gave us each and every dessert on the menu. They were all very good and well presented. Particularly tasty desserts were the strawberry chocolate chip shortcake, frozen peanut butter parfait, walnut flan, and coconut macadamia cake.   The service is what you would expect for the restaurant. Friendly and attentive when needed, unobtrusive when not.   Now for the not so good.   The wine list was very unimpressive for a restaurant of this caliber. It was also not priced well as it was very top heavy. The quesadilla appetizers were ok. Each had the potential to be good, however the paired sauces overpowered the interiors.  The mains disappointed several of us. Each of the seafood dishes were overcooked. The orange sauce for the grouper did not go well with char. The salmon seemed to have little spice. The scallops relatively bland. The pork was also overcooked, though the person ordered it well.    I was far from impressed by the food, and I didn't even have high expectations. I admit I was stuffed, but mostly because I ate my weight in desserts. Our group did not leave hungry, just maybe yearning for something a little better from such an accomplished chef.",

The tuna was excellent and I could have used a double portion.  The Goat Cheese Queso was very good, but how could you go wrong with melted cheese.  For dinner, the coffee rubbed filet and the green chili ciopino with crispy squash blossom and mashed potatoes for sides.  The cioppino was very fresh and flavorful.  Getting the shrimp peeled was a little messy,  but worth the added flavor.  My only complaint was that after eating most of the seafood from the dish the green chili base was not quite as visually appealing.  The filet was tender and the coffee rub wasn't overpowering.  Unfortunately, the filet wasn't hot and the plate was cold so the mushrooms and ancho chili sauce didn't come across very well.  The sqaush blossoms where incredibly light and the mashed potatoes were creamy.    I'll definitely be back, but I would probably opt for lunch instead of dinner.",

Don't think twice, start with yucatan tacos they are wonderful deconstructed beauties touched off with a wonderful peanut chili (of course) BBQ sauce, these play like a Southwestern Thai fusion. Now you're ready for your main course, again don't think twice, it's the chili (of course) rubbed pork tenderloin, the recommendation will be that you get it medium rare (but you weren't thinking anything different) this life changing hunk of meat is served with a sweet potato tamale topped with a pecan butter.

Yes, he may be egocentric but I'm giving him this; He has mastered the craft of blending southwestern flavors in ways never seen before!  After deciding to take my old man to Vegas for his 55th birthday, I made reservations at Mesa Grill. Knowing that my father appreciates southwestern spices and flavors, I knew it was going to be an adventure for both of us. 8:15 PM reservations on Friday night (10-10-08) and we were seated immediately. Started with some Black Widow Mojitos and some shots of Patron Silver. The mood of the restaurant was definitely busy and loud (not overly loud...I was able to have a nice conversation with my father). I wouldn't recommend it for a &quot;romantic&quot; dinner between two people. I did love the vibrant southwestern colors that covered M.G.  We ordered up a Smoked Chicken / Black Bean Quesadilla for an appetizer. Cut in four equal slices, these little triangles of taste bud bursting goodness satisfied as well as brought mass excitement to what was coming in the main course. The flavors that popped from the chicken were amazing, very tasty!  My father got the Chipotle Halibut (which he raved about for days after the trip, stating &quot;The best meal I have ever had&quot;). I got the Chipotle Glazed Rib Eye with Green and Red Sauce, which was extremely tender and full of flavors of chills, garlic and grilled aged beef...well worth getting if you are a steak fan (ask for it medium rare!).   After reading some of the reviews pre and post my visit to the Mesa Grill in Las Vegas, I have got to speak from the heart...and from the heart of someone who likes to enjoy a good meal...  - If you can't hang with the high end cost...DON'T GO! I look at a meal like this as experiencing art and taking in everything as an experience as a whole. Food, at this caliber, shouldn't be consumed as a burger from In-N-Out or a Pizza from Round Table. It should be enjoyed bite by bite. Some people just don't understand how someone could drop a C-Note + for a meal...but then again, some people can't and don't understand the arts.   - Small portions aren't necessarily a bad thing, especially if you take it bite by bite and enjoy what you are tasting. Buffets are all good when you are down to get stuffed for a good price. Here, you pay for high quality dishes that will be sure to stuff you if you take your time and enjoy it.   - The dishes I tried definitely brought the heat! Amazing flavors that aren't afraid of leaving some sweat on the brow! (The Black Widow Mojito is really a refreshing beverage when eating some of the more spicier dishes).   - While I heard about the poor service, the staff were on the ball (consider this was on a Friday night from 8:00 - 9: 30 PM). Very friendly and helpful.   2 Black Widow Mojitos 2 Shots Of Patron 1 Smoked Chicken Quesadilla Appetizer 1 Chipotle Halibut Entree 1 Chipotle Glazed Rib Eye  Total W/ Tip : $180.00  Yeah, Bobby Flay has gained some respect from me and I'll be returning to his institution for sure!",

The decor is modern and bright with primary colors decorating the bar and more subtle hues throughout the dining room.  Our waitress was prompt in every way.  She brought us the delicious bread basket, which included a piece of Mesa Grill's cinammon roll, some jalapeno biscuits, and yellow and blue cornbread muffins.    My hubby and I ordered the same dish - the spicy scrambled eggs.  The fluffy eggs came mixed with jalapenos, goat cheese, and green onions, and were topped with apricot glazed ham.  They were served with two wonderful buttermilk biscuits.  The goat cheese and jalapenos combined for the perfect explosion of flavor without either flavor overwhelming the dish.  I am not usually a ham person, but this ham was top notch.  I think we will add Mesa Grill's brunch to our regular stops when we are in LV.  It was really that good.",

Another had some sort of spicy salmon dish they felt was pretty good.  Nothing to complain about--just nothing unique.  And what a shame.    Well Bobby.  After eating your food I'm ready for a throwdown.  Not a throw up though--but a throwdown--sure.",

As much as sometimes I really, really find myself disliking Bobby Flay in all his flair and glory on Food Network, his food is honestly pretty solid. I can't deny that I had some delicious southern / Mexican inspired dining here with a great group of friends.  The drinks were great, the appetizers were plenty and the flavors were spot on. The service is excellent and they're definitely great for a group.  I recommend the margaritas simply because they're good (but pricey, but good!) as well as the tuna nachos and a few other notables already mentioned here. Check it out!",

When you make your reservation, you have to give them a credit card number to hold your spot.     We arrived about 15 minutes before our reservation time, and we were still seated immediately.  I loved how the servers was very attentive and chatty.   The complimentary bread basket was very good.  I loved how there was different selections (jalapeno bread, cornbread, walnut bread).  For an appetizer, we decided to try the chicken quesadilla, and it was really good.  I would highly recommend it.     We decided to order the 22 ounce Chipotle Rib Eye Steak for our entree.  The steak was huge and can definitely feed 2 people.  The steak was cooked pretty well.  I loved dipping the steak in the sauce.   Overal, service was really good here.  I really enjoyed the bread and apps.",

    "text": "I went over labor day weekend with my family that was visiting from out of town.  The restaurant itself has a good feel about it, and is classy without feeling too pretentious.   Our waiter arrived shortly after we were seated to go over the food and drink menus. He left us to give us some time, but came back about 3 minutes later. He asked if we were ready, and I apologized that we were not, and asked him to give us just a few more minutes. Big mistake.  I think he was annoyed that we weren't ready, and after 5 minutes went by, we couldn't find him. Another 5 went by, and he surfaced because the table next to us had just been seated. He did the same menu review, and left. Then, he came back to get their order and my dad finally got his attention. He told us he would be back for us after he went and got the other table's drinks.  Wouldn't you take our drink order as well???   Fast forward another 5 min, and we finally placed our order. The drinks arrived relatively quick, along with a bread basket that was rather impressive. Great selection, and truly unique flavor combinations. They are known to have excellent margaritas, however, I really wasn't that impressed by them. They were good, but not \"I will compare all others against this\" good.   It wasn't long before our entrees arrived. I had the tuna steak which comes on a bed of cous cous. Overall, it was really quite good. The only downside was that you would get some bites that had such a high salt concentration, you wanted to spit. In that respect, the margarita came in handy ;)    3 members of our table had the sixteen spice chicken, which is supposed to be one of their most recommended and popular dishes. All 3 complained that the chicken was dry, and that they were really disappointed with the dish. Another family member had the pork tenderloin, which he enjoyed, but didn't feel was all that impressive.   After we finished, our waiter came over with the dessert menus, and said he would give us time to look it over.  I'd say at minimum, about 10 minutes passed before he returned.  We were going to order dessert, but the lack of service finally made us decide to just leave and go somewhere else for dessert.   My father is a seven-stars member, and has been for well over a decade, so we've been to almost every nice restaurant in the caesar's entertainment family, and have generally received excellent service. On that note, Mesa failed horribly, and the service would still be sub-par even if he wasn't 7 stars.  The hostess and other staff were friendly, but no one should spend $300 plus tip for a waiter that has an attitude and treats his table like they we were an inconvenience to him.   I don't think we'll ever be returning, and will stick to Ruth's Chris, Old Homestead, or Gordon Ramsay's restaurants from now on.",

Lobster tacos - I have no clue where the lobster was.  Didn't taste like anything to do with lobster.  Honestly couldn't make out what was in that yummy black corn shell.  It tasted okay but not something I'd ever order again.  Chile Relleno - it was filled with cheese and grilled eggplants.  I didn't try it but my husband enjoyed it.  Passion fruit cheesecake - delicious!  Carrot cake ice cream sandwich - looked pretty but difficult to eat.  My husband ate the ice cream but had a difficulty with the hard shell.  Brenda removed the soup from our check.  The service was amazing as before (everyone).  The food was not as good as before.  May be back at one point...hope next time will be better.",

I came on a Friday at about 11:45am and it wasn't too crowded, but by the time I left around 12:30pm, it seemed like quite the place to be, especially for business lunches/convention attendees.   I went with chicken eggs benedict, which is supposedly very similar to their brunch dish.  I wanted to try to get a feel for brunch without coming on a weekend.  I did just that with this delicious dish with a nice spiciness that you usually don't get from traditional brunch options.  My meal came with three options of bread as well: raisin, jalapeno, and corn.  The jalapeno was the only one in which I would recommend; the other two were just eh.  My benedict was a very good option.  The other meals at Mesa Grill looked good and portion sizes were excellent.  At $18 for my meal, I think it was probably $3 too expensive, but celebrity chefs are able to get away with that.  Drink options were pretty limited and started at $14 so I didn't even try.    Mesa Grill has some very interesting dishes with a totally different flare.  They also have quick and great service all around.  You will surely pay a little too much for the meal but if you're craving a New Mexican style entree on strip, this is by far your best bet.",

    "text": "Great service. Excellent meal. We started with the Mesa Spreads served with homemade crisps but also good with the bread from the generous assortment that came to our table. So good. Our entrees were the New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin with a sweet potato tamale and Grilled Mahi Mahi with risotto. The server was very attentive and because I let him know that I did not want my food too spicy he brought three different sauces on the side for me to choose from for my fish. Overall this was the best meal we've had in any of the restaurants at Caesar's.",

One with jalapeno, another with raisins, and a 3rd that's muffin like (not sure of the flavor). I wasn't a huge fan. I tried the grilled  mahi mahi as well with mole sauce and it was delicious, if anything I wish there would have been a little bit more of the sauce, I ran out way before I finished my fish. I tried the grilled chicken and it was really good as well. For drinks we ordered the cactus pear Margarita, and the white peach Margarita, hands down go for the white peach Margarita on the rocks. You will not be disappointed. As for dessert, we ordered the lemon tart, it was meh, too sweet. Next time I'll probably pass on the dessert.",

    "text": "Mesa Grill is Bobby Flay's restaurant in the lobby of Caesar's Palace.  Across from the Sports Book, the restaurant tries to make you forget that you are in Vegas.  As long as you are not facing the outside, this is relatively successful (if you are facing the outside, forget it, because the windows are to the casino).  The restaurant is very attractive - the decor is understated and the white tablecloths give a fine dining flair.  The service is a good - friendly but harried (each server has too many tables).  The food is divine.  We had: Baby Romaine Salad ($14): leaves of baby romaine are dressed in roasted garlic dressing and tossed with hominy croutons, rounds of chorizo and crumbled cotija cheese. This is an amazing salad. Each leaf is dressed with the slightly nutty dressing that is not overpowering. The crunchy little cubes of hominy polenta are creamy and surprising. The chorizo is like smoky thick cut pepperoni. Yum! Sweet Potato Clam Chowder ($14): a soup bowl of smoky sweet potato cream soup with little tiny cubes of sweet potato and bacon as well as chopped clams that has a distinct but not bitter chile flavor and is topped with two clams in the shell. Another outstanding dish! This is one of the best soups that I have ever had. Sweet, smoky and spicy with lots of textural elements. Ancho Chile-Honey Glazed Salmon ($25): a spicy black bean sauce with a dollop of a mild roasted jalapeno crema with a drizzle of ancho chile sauce is topped with a pile of sauteed spinach and one of the finest pieces of salmon that I have had glazed in honey with chili powder and topped with minced tomatillos and scallions. Homerun! The salmon was cooked to our request - crunchy exterior with fleshy interior that is my kind of rare. The sweet and spicy glaze, the earthy black bean sauce and the smoky chile sauce are a delight to the tastebuds. One of the best pieces of salmon that I have ever had. Are we going to have dessert? Let's look...OMG.  Carrot Cake Ice Cream Sandwich ($12): two crunchy spice cookies with lots of shredded carrot sandwich 1\" thick slab of cream cheese ice cream and are surrounded by dulce de leche sauce and crumbled pralines and are topped with little cubes of roasted pineapple. Bobby Flay does it again. The ice cream tastes like the best cream cheese frosting ever, but lighter and cold. The cookies are reminiscent of my mom's carrot cake, and the sweet and nutty roasted pineapple cubes bring the whole dish home. I have been a fan of Bobby Flay's for a long time, and this was my first time dining in one of his restaurants. I love that the real experience lived up to my expectations. I highly recommend it.",

Much of the salad was brown and wilted and there was only 4 small lices of chorizo..   The tamale was OK, but very skimpy. Nothing like in the pictures posted..

Great food + great service = happy girl.   What more can I ask ??  I came with a bachelorette party (about 10 total) and we had great service.   This club consisted of avocados ( I loveeeee avocados! ) tomatos, bacon, and chipotle aioli. Also came with a side of fries.   I ate half of it because I was going to a pool party and didn't want my stomach bulging out like the night before when I went to eat at a buffet. Oh man I learned my lesson - I was too full to function. But that's a different story. So I was hoping to eat the other half when I wanted some drunk munchies.   My cousins ordered burgers and other items and they all loved it.    This sandwich was so good that when I came back drunk from the club, all I was kept saying was \"I want my sandwich\" over and over while stumbling and rolling on the bed, according to my cousin.   I can't wait to come back!",

Hand crafted margaritas are featured on the drink menu, and the dinner menu is built on a foundation of corn and chili spiced proteins.  We wanted something with tequila in it ASAP, and were happy with the margarita and basket of house bread and blue corn muffin that arrived.  We started with the Blue Corn Lobster Tacos. Fresh, light, and delicate in texture, the two bite tacos were tasty though perhaps missing their lobster flavor.  For Entrees we tried the Ancho Chili-Honey Glazed Salmon which I asked for medium-rare, and the New Mexican Spiced Rubbed Pork Tenderloin, served medium, with Sweet Potato Tamale.  The salmon was super tender and moist, but unexpectedly mild in flavored, we couldn't really taste the glaze.  The pork tenderloin was incredibly tender and juicy and we used the tamale to sop up the sauces.  The entrees come ala carte so you'll want to get some sides, we tried the Roasted Corn and Collard Greens.  The Roasted Corn is a superstar.  Sweet summer corn is roasted, but still crunchy, creamy and spiced from the aioli, brightened with lime and cilantro, and sprinkled with salty, tangy cotija cheese.  The collared greens were pretty standard, but made us feel like we ate our vegetables.  Overall we liked Mesa Grill.  The food was well prepared and service was attentive and helpful.  This would be a great place to eat and drink with friends.",

Mashers were also great, loved the cheesy sauce on top  Bread Basket-a lovely variety of tasty morsels, especially the blue corn muffin  Service was top notch, nothing else left to say!  Overall Thoughts  Damn you Bobby Flay, you sauce master!",

We're poor, so we went for lunch and thought it was definitely worth the price.  The waiter recommended a margarita that was out of this world.  I'm sure there are other places that are fancier and better, but we're poor.  It was the best meal we had in Vegas!   :)",

The best thing I tried the whole night was the fried squash blossom appetizer-- fresh, tasty and savory with a light batter on the outside and a wonderfully smooth ricotta filling.  The other dishes, however, were too over-seasoned for my palette.  I'm the kind of guy who thinks spices and sauces should compliment the flavor of the meat, not mask it.  I'm fairly sure my pork tenderloin (apparently the \"signature\" dish) was brined before it was cooked, which was totally unnecessary.   The result was an extremely salty cut of meat that was too soft with little texture.  Any hint of pork flavor that may have been left after the brining was heavily masked by a trio of overpowering sauces and a crust of spices (and possibly more salt?).  Needless to say, I think I would slaughter Bobby Flay in a pork tendrloin throw-down.  Also, don't come here wearing a hat, as they will make you take it off.  Don't you know it is disrespectful to cover your head in the presence of the almighty Flay?! (rolls eyes)",

    "text": "Ok, so we just returned from vacation and I think this is the first time I've written a Yelp review on vacation.  My boyfriend is a HUGE fan of Bobby Flay, and tries to emulate his own cooking after Flay's style.  I don't cook and I am a very picky eater, but what an amazing and fun experience Mesa Grill was!  I don't eat meat but I love seafood so I was happy to see spicy tuna & salmon tartares on the appetizer menu.  Every ingredient enhanced the fish, and the combination of various spices and herbs was a symphony of flavor!  Loved the appetizer!  Being the salad person that I am, I ordered the grilled asparagus salad...grilled asparagus, pecans, wild roasted mushrooms and mixed greens, and I asked for no blue cheese crumbles though that is also part of the dish.  It was gorgeous, both in plating appearance and taste.  Rob excitedly ordered the coffee-rubbed filet mignon and I think we took multiple pictures of his dish before he cut into it.  I didn't taste it, but he swears up and down that it was the \"best meal I've ever eaten\".  The service was spot on and the wine sommelier even came to our table to help us pick out a spectacular cuvee that went with our meal.  We're already planning our next trip to Vegas...or maybe NYC or the Bahamas where the other Mesa Grill venues are located.  :)",

    "text": "I have been to this restaurant several times at the Bahamas location and it was always by far the best restaurant I have been to.   I was in Vegas this past weekend with 5 of my girlfriends for a girls weekend away.  I convinced them we had to go here for dinner because it was so amazing.  We ended up leaving quite disappointed and it still makes me bummed out to think about our experience.   First off, our appetizers took a long time to come out, but we just figured oh well, and we enjoyed them immensely.   Next came out our main courses.   3 of the 6 dishes that came out (2 filets and 1 salmon) were barely warm.  We kindly told our server about this, and she took them back and brought out new hot plates.  We are paying plenty of money to have our food come out hot.   The manager came over in the midst of this and gave a good fake \"I'm so sorry, yada yada yada\"   He came off like he was just going thru the motions and could care less about our issues.  Again, just blew it off and went about eating our newly delicious hot meals.   About 3/4 the way thru I noticed what looked to be a dark black hair about an inch/inch and 1/2 long in the middle of my sauce and mushrooms that went over my filet.  This instantly made my stomach turn and I was done.   All SIX of us were done at that point.   We had our server come back over and she took the plate without saying much.   She came back about 10 minutes later giving us the bill and saying the manager took off 2 of the plates and that they went back and investigated the hair and they thought it was a bristle from a brush they used in the kitchen.  Almost trying to justify the problem.  About 15 minutes had passed since finding this hair, and the manager FINALLY walks over again and says sorry and have a good night.   2 of the girls with us had been servers for many years and they said he was so incredibly unprofessional and we were all blown away at how this manager handled our situation.   We definitely fell on the younger side of the crowd, so my feeling was that he just kind of disregarded us since we were just younger and maybe he thought we were just looking for trouble.  Not really sure.  We were all dressed up and looked classy for a nice dinner out.   We all grew up going to nice restaurants, so we know what to expect.   Overall, the food is amazing here, but how this manager handled our situation made our experience extremely distasteful.",

    "text": "This restaurant is a giant let down. I went in last night for my anniversary with my girlfriend and I was completely disappointed.  When you call and make a reservation you don't actually deal with the restaurant, but you go through the hotel. I had to give a credit card number to make a reservation for two. The lady who took my reservation didn't ask if we were celebrating a special occasion or not, which you would expect from a nice restaurant.  When we got there we were sat promptly and ordered some drinks. The drinks came out quick which is the only real compliment I can give this place. The busboy was also adept at keeping our water glasses full.  We asked our waiter for a recommendation for an appetizer. He recommended the tiger shrimp tamale. It was bland and tasteless and was definitely not worth the $16. The sauce served no purpose on the dish, and it seemed sloppily executed. From watching Bobby Flay on t.v. I was expecting a dish with bold flavors. Instead we were served cafeteria food.  For dinner I ordered the 22oz rib eye medium. The steak came out raw, and I had to send it back to the kitchen. After 5 minutes or so I finally got my steak which was still raw, but not worth the trouble of sending it back. Now I've worked in restaurants before. If I or the kitchen made a mistake I would own up to it by comping a drink or desert or whatever. I was given an apology, but nothing more. To me this indicated that they did not care what I thought or if I would ever come back here.  Another thing that made me slightly angry was that no one took the time to ask if we were celebrating a special occasion. In all fairness to the restaurant we might have had a bad server. Attention to detail separates great or even good restaurants from places like this one.  It makes me angry to think that I spent $200+ on a sub-par dinner. Last year we went to Rosemary's and were blown away by their service. If you are going to spend good money on dinner, then the food and service must be executed with a certain level of competency.  This restaurant is over-priced, and not worth the trouble. Don't waste your money here, and don't buy into the hype that is Bobby Flay.",

I thought the chicken slices were too bland and not enough kick. For dessert, we ordered the profiteroles with the Mexican chocolate sauce.

    "text": "I have dined at Mesa Grill four times since living in Las Vegas, and have been very pleased with my meal every time.  It's not often that I enjoy a meal I had on the strip, as most of the strip restaurants are overpriced, and serve average food with a celebrity name on it.  Bobby Flay created a great restaurant, and I think it's very telling of the chef that Bobby Flay is.  Many don't like his conceited attitude, but he makes great food and does it while running many restaurants.    The decor is very unique, and is perfect for it's location.  It is located in the Caesar's Palace, right next to the sportsbook.  The restaurant is scattered with a mosaic of rusty, yet bright colors.  The colors represent the southwestern theme of the restaurant, with influences of South America.   The service at Mesa Grill is top notch.  When your water is even close to done, it will be full.  When your drink is almost gone, they will ask you if you want a new one.  The corkage fee is $35, which is a bit steep for a place like this, but it's not too bad considering it's Las Vegas.  The waiters always have great suggestions, and are very knowledgeable on the menu and the terms of Southwestern cuisine.    There are several signature items on the menu that are must-order items.  One of them is the Blue Corn, Duck Pancake.  BBQ duck is shredded and put into a blue corn pancake, and is topped with Habanero-Star Anise sauce.  This is the best appetizer.  Another great appetizer is the \"Queso Fundido\", a cheese dip made with goat cheese that is easy for the whole table to eat, and is the best cheese dip I've ever had.    The best entree I've had here, and their signature entree, is the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin.  The portion is pretty big, and the pork is cooked perfect every time I've had it.  It is served with a sweet-potato tamale, and a bourbon-ancho chile sauce.  I have had this 3 times, and every time it has been the best thing at the table.   The other entree that I recommend is the Lamb Porterhouse Chops, served with Red Chile, Lime, and Rosemary.  If there was any dish that could be better than the Pork Tenderloin, it's the Lamb Porterhouse Chops.  Although, if you like fish, try the Spice Rubbed Tuna, which is also very good.   If you want a steak, there are 3 steak options on the menu.  All of them are very good, but not as unique as the other menu items.  There is a chipotle-glazed Ribeye, Coffee-rubbed Filet Mignon, and a New York Strip Steak served w/ their house-made Steak Sauce.  If you are looking to sample signature Bobby Flay cuisine, do not get the steaks.  But if you are the person in the group who wanted to go to the steakhouse, this is not a bad second option for a great steak.    In conclusion, do not let your opinion of Bobby Flay steer you away from eating at Mesa Grill.  You may not like the guy, but the cuisine he cooks is a full of bold, unique flavors, and combines those flavors perfectly to show you why Bobby Flay is so popular.",

Bobby, how do you manage to play with Southwestern flavors so naturally and creatively, elevate it to gourmet level, and yet maintain its authentic homey quality? He is the most down-to-earth of all the talented celebrity chefs, and you can feel it in his food.   The restaurant is another story... It's wonderfully trendy and fun, very colorful. The ambience feels more like a fancy bar, but I love it. We came here to start a night that ended at PURE; a really good way to start your night, it has a great energy.  If you're in Vegas and thinking of trying this place, stop thinking and just eat here!  We came without reservations on a busy Friday night. The wait was very long, but they were accommodating and offered to serve us in the bar area. The bar tables are pretty small, and could barely fit our party of four. But the food made up for everything. This is a small restaurant ladies and gentlemen, and it gets PACKED! So please, do yourselves a favor and make a RESERVATION.   I had the ancho-chile marinated salmon, and the cilantro mashed potatoes. The red-sauce basted salmon came plated atop a green tomatillo sauce and a black bean sauce. Did I mention i love sauces?! Everything was very flavorful, which makes me happy, but all well-balanced. The cilantro mashed potatoes were my FAV, I'm a big fan of cilantro.   The best part....wait for it...all the recipes are available on the food network website, so you can make Bobby's dishes at home! I'm not sure if they will come out as good, though. I will be making this salmon (with the sauces) at home.  Price: $42 plus tax and tip for the salmon and mashed potatoes. A bit pricey, but well worth it.  BOTTOM LINE: Brilliant use of southwestern flavors, amazing food. It's a bit pricey, but worth it. Splurge a little, give it a try, I guarantee you won't regret it. Don't forget to make a reservation.",

I have gone here quite a few times on my own and always sit at the bar and meet interesting people, grab a drink, and have an appetizer for my meal.  I like the \"rough cut tuna nachos\" but last night I decided to try something else.  I was looking at the \"green chile crostini salad with anchovies and ricotta\" but the bartender recommended other things.  I ended up getting the grilled octopus salad with smoked paprika, shallots and lime.  It was divine, 2 whole tentacles, and reminded me of grilled octopus in NYC.  I also had a cactus pear margarita and it was great.  The bread basket was great too mmm!!!    I also sit next to some awesome people.  Once, a ticket broker for boxing matches.  Then, a couple who told me about Vegas Uncorked and led me to go to the Grand Tasting last year (and they paid for my meal).  Last night, a law professor in town for a conference.  Mesa is a great place with delicious food, a great atmosphere, and interesting people.",

The scallops and pumpkin soup (when available) are outstanding appetizers.  The coffee rubbed filet and the pork tenderloin are fantastic main courses.  You can't go wrong with the sticky toffee for dessert!",

    "text": "There is a reason Bobby Flay is an Iron Chef and owner of Mesa Grill and other restaurants... he makes simple food decadently delicious!  We had made brunch reservations one month in advance, as we knew they get booked quickly.  We arrived a little early and were warmly greeted and promptly seated. The decor was inviting and the ambience stylish and warm (see our picture).  Having gotten to know Bobby Flay's personality through watching him on the Food Network, it was pleasantly surprising to see that his staff embodies this warm personality too.   Our waitress reviewed the menu with us and explained some of Bobby's signature dishes as well as making some recommendations.  While we perused the menu, the flavorful basket of mini cornbreads and assorted small pastries was brought out to our table as were our drinks (Cactus pear iced tea, cofee and Margarita).  Appetizers our party of 4 shared: *Goat cheese \"Queso Fundido\" with blue corn tortilla chips - the flavor of the goat cheese dip topped with roasted peppers so full of robust rustic flavor - a solid 5 Stars!  *Shrimp and sweet corn tamale -Bobby Flay's signature dish. Well balanced flavors, shrimp was cooked to perfection - another 5 star dish. Though the dish comes with 4 large tiger shrimp it would serve as a good appetizer for 2 instead of 4.  Entrees - our waitress let us know how these were going to be cooked and at what temperature to expect them so we wouldn't have any surprises. *Spicy Scrambled Eggs - served with Green Onion, Jalapeno, Goat Cheese, Apricot-Mustard Glazed Ham and Buttermilk Biscuits - very good flavors. *Spicy Chicken & Sweet Potato Hash served with Poached Eggs & Green Chile Hollandaise - this flavor profile was very delicious  *Grilled Mahi Mahi with Roasted Pineapple-Cascabel Chile Sauce Caramelized Pineapple-Green Onion Salsa & Creamy Green Chile Rice - perfect balance of bright flavors and texture. The Cascabel chile sauce was so good I used the little cornbreads to dip and polish it off my plate! *New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich with Grilled Red Onion, Arugula, Ancho-Chile Mayonnaise & Southwestern Fries - fantastic flavor and the southwestern fries were warm and crispy- not oily at all.  The portions were perfectly sized for brunch but we all agreed we could have eaten more of every dish that we had ordered as every bite was a burst of delicious flavor that tantalized our taste buds.  The service was attentive without being obtrusive. The waitress was knowledgeable and made good recommendations. They have an extensive Margarita menu and the one I had was fantastic.  We added pictures of the food we ordered and I made everyone wait to eat so that I could take some good pictures so make sure to check them out.   We will be definitely coming back here to try their other dishes.",

    "text": "We came here for dinner and were looking for something light to eat since we'd be meeting up with other friends later.  So we ordered two appetizers (the shrimp with garlic tamale and the rough cut tuna nacho), an entree (chile relleno), and a dessert (the banana creme pie).  These along with the bread basket was more than enough food for the three of us.   I can't tell you which was was my favorite, b/c really they were all good.  The garlic corn tamale hit just the right notes of sweet and savory and paired really well with the shrimp.  Def a must order.  I think I like the tuna more though, b/c generally I like my seafood raw.  My husband loved the chile relleno, and said that it was the best he's ever had.  He's eaten a ton of this stuff, so that's saying a lot.  The dessert was a good finisher...it was more like a deconstructed banana cream pie.  i thought that the candied hazelnut at the bottom really added to the dish.   I will be returning for brunch, since this is what Flay is really known for.  Can't wait.",

    "text": "To say this was one of the best meals I have ever had is an injustice to the awesomeness that it truly was. Everything from the service to the food to the atmosphere was top notch.  The service was attentive, knowledgeable, not pushy. The atmosphere was a subtle change from the chaos of Vegas and Caesar's Palace, and I love that they have a very open concept and feature the grill front and center.  For the food, you can't go wrong with anything. Get a Pisco Sour as your drink, a spicier version of a margarita hailing from South America. We started with the prawn tamales and they were heaven -- the quality of the shrimp set it apart from anything you've had elsewhere.  For dinner we split the ancho-chile crusted pork tenderloin (served medium) and it was so tender you could cut it with a spoon and didn't need to chew. Not sure where they get their pork, but I want to shop there.  On the side we ordered a twice baked potato (for the Mrs.) and some Mexican-style street corn with cotija cheese. The corn was easily one of the best side dishes I have ever had a restaurant, crisp, sweet, creamy, flavorful.  We skipped dessert because we didn't want to mess up the flavors we had going on, but in hind sight we should have kept going on that gravy train. All in all, great meal for around $100.",

Salad dressing paired very well.. Except there wasn't much lettuce... Bread basket was amazing!!! You have to try the  Jalapeno corn poppers! And blueberry muffin!!   I sat at the bar.

Nicely toasted and the beef came out that perfect pink.   Does it really set itself far ahead of other burger places... eh well no it is a burger so I guess I should have expected that. I planned to try other items however, looking around it seemed as though everyone within our vicinity was having the burger. I've had this happen way too many times where I stray away from what other people are getting to try something new, but it always happens that I try their dish and wish I hadn't.   Anyhow, I would come back if it was convenient. I would not go out of my way to try the burger, maybe other items on the menu? Although to be completely truthful I enjoyed the burger so much I wouldn't try something else since I know exactly what I'm getting.   It's worth a shot for sure!",

I have gone through about 95% of the menu and I couldn't say one thing bad about this place or any of the items. But my heart will always be with the tamales! That being said, I have tried the tamales at all 3 locations and while NYC had the best in my opinion, they are now closed and this location now holds my heart.

    "text": "Bobby Flay's take on Vegas doesn't have the luster that it does in New York.  Mr. Flay's west coast version was a dream realized only 5 years ago and being situated in a place like Caesars Palace seems ideal.  After all, being the predominant cuisine is Southwest, what better location (aside from Arizona / New Mexico) than Las Vegas?  What is strange to me is that the prices are significantly higher in Las Vegas than the New York location.  A slab of fish of any type could be had for $2-3 less and this includes most of the other appetizers / entrees.  I have no problem paying more for better food, but this does not trump anything that could be had in New York.  The restaurant itself is gorgeous.  A great mix of vibrant colors surround the dining area, with a contemporary feel with an elegant twist.  The funky shapes accompanied by the eclectic decor, which really pounces on the New American theme, while retaining a Southwest element in the food.  I'd give the nod to Las Vegas over New York for ambiance and the overall interior look, however, I expect this since this location is significantly newer.  Service is fantastic.  Our waiters were extremely knowledgeable in the food and were able to make excellent recommendations that were enough to impress our guests.  The menus change often and often times it is completely different than anything offered in New York or the Bahamas.  On a whole Mesa Grill is a real decent place to catch a great meal for business and pleasure.  Most of my business meetings have been during their lunch hour, which I prefer over dinner.  It's not the best in the Bobby Flay restaurant family, but certainly not the worst.",

    "text": "Went with a group of friends.  We're on a celebrity chef kick and were looking forward to trying Bobby Flay's food.  Also, been wanting to trying it as I wanted to take my mom who I suspect is in love with Bobby Flay.  #1, even with reservations, you cannot be seated unless your whole party is there.  We were never instructed/given the suggestion of having drinks at the bar.  Though bar was quite crowded anyway.  The result was a very number of us, maybe 20 or so, standing in the reception area.  A bit of a crowd and much jostling about as people were coming and going and waiters/waitresses were trying to pass by.  Wait staff seated us and gave menus promptly.  No specials mentioned and they seemed frazzled, Sunday night over Memorial Day.  Had the cactus pear margarita.  Very good.  Had asked if bartender could make a jalapeno mojito but apparently he didn't know how (don't have a fancy smartphone to google recipe?).  Bartender was kind enough to get us the recipe for the drink though.  Wait staff continued to underimpress us as a fine dining experience but were adequate if we pretended we were at Outbacks.  So the night before we watched a rerun of best things I ever ate Vegas.  Mentioned was the shrimp tamale.  Wow, it certainly was pretty mediocre.  Sauce and shrimp was cooked well but that was one dry tamale.  We ate the shrimp and left the rest of tamale.  Also had the duck tacos.  The duck was a bit overcooked but the sauce was good.  Onto food, pork tenderloin was tasty, chicken was dry and husband's rib eye steak was mediocre.  I ordered the tuna steak.  I ordered it rare and it came out medium well, there was a light pink center with canned tuna tasting outer layer.  Promptly sent back.  They redid and it was OK but it was obvious the grill master did not have the grill high enough for sufficient crisping of the outer layer. We ordered some corn tamales and corn pudding.  The tamale went mostly uneaten after the first bite and the corn pudding was salty.  We were so disappointed we decided to head elsewhere for dessert.  Total bill was $450+tip for 4 people and drinks.    Having eaten at Rick Bayless's restaurant Topo in Chicago, the difference between having the chef on site vs only their name plastered on the door is remarkable.  On a Wed, Bayless was there with a stained apron, sweating away in the kitchen.  It's been 2 years and I still remember that remarkable restaurant.  I will remember this restaurant only in terms of it's disappointments.  All hype and no substance.  May try his flagship in NYC, hopefully will be better but not much inspired to do so after this flop.",

Because it was Sunday at 11:30am, we were told brunch was served.    The brunch menu was kind of limited  (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mesagrill.com%2Flasvegas%2Fpdf%2Fmesalvbrunch.01.08.10.pdf&s=e854e68cd4a4fc1899213382bb9f8c9a6a91a016035858a7246cd55a4de34adc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">mesagrill.com/lasvegas/p...</a>).  We decided on the following:  1)  TIGER SHRIMP TAMALE with CREAMED CORN (not on the above menu) - $16. (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=bZdGAk4KyioloJNNm9GiIA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbu...</a>) This was quite good.  I'm not a fan of tamale but I enjoyed the creamed corn and the shrimps (total of 4!).    2)  ANCHO CHILE-HONEY GLAZED SALMON in Spicy Black Bean Sauce + Roasted Jalapeno Crema - $22. (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=ZzxIYMiVP3O1osnjdF4Hfg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbu...</a>) I ordered it well done.  The salmon was very tender with good flavor.  However it must have sat on the counter for awhile b/c it was barely lukewarm!    3)  NEW MEXICAN SPICED PORK TENDERLOIN SANDWICH Grilled Red Onion, Arugula Ancho-Chile Mayonnaise + Southwestern Fries - $16. (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=QQ6QbO2CmSWDD7l9OwudAw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbu...</a>) This was the biggest disappointment of the meal.  My fiance gave it 1 star.  Enough said.    Service was spotty.  At first it was really good, but then it just went down hill.  Like I said earlier, our food must have sat on the kitchen counter for awhile b/c my salmon was barely lukewarm and my fiance's sandwich (the pork tenderloin) was cold and hard!  Our iced teas were getting refilled until we were done eating.  Then they took the plates away and didn't bother asking if we would like another refill.  C'mon, even if we're done, we might still like some more ice tea!  I thought the quality and service didn't measure up to my expectation and the prices.  3 stars is all it gets.",

By the time we left 90 minutes later, the place was packed and the line wound outside and around the corner.  And with good reason.    She started with the sweet potato soup.  It was perfection in a bowl. Sweet, creamy without being heavy.  My goat cheese queso fundido with blue corn tortilla strips was cheesy, slightly spicy, with more than enough chips. Really tasty.  She had a Mesa burger, which might be the best burger she ever had.  Cooked exactly as ordered (rare),it was thick, juicy and loaded with flavor.  Even the bun stood out.  My cornmeal crusted chile relleno had a delicious crust loaded with great corn flavor.  The pepper itself could have spicier to my taste, but the cheese and sauce inside blended perfectly-a well presented lunchtime treat.  We both preferred the burger, but not because the chile was bad in any way.  The burger was just that good.  We'd return.",

It took us three nights to get there due to being in Vegas for New Years, but I digress. The Ambiance is stunning.  The chef location is like  the command center of great ship.  Right in the middle for everyone to bear witness to.  The chefs cooking are like a well oiled machine, all the BF Rubs are all right there, the food is cooked in unison.    The waiter were all very pleasant and super helpful with our little ones too.  They were on top of everything. Clearing the table when plates were empty, and adding water to the cups when they were still half full.  The pre-food.  They brought out a few different kinds of bread and muffins.  The jalapeno bread was delicious, the raisin and walnut was magnificent and the muffins were all soft and buttery.   I had the cactus tea which was super delicious!  My wife had the veal which melted off the bone and was so succulent my mouth is still watering for it.  This is the funny part, I was never a fan of beef or meats. However,  I ordered the New york strip steak.  Cooked to perfection, the dry rub was superb and the small amount of sauce that came with it, I savored every little bit.    The desert as a chocolate cake plated with some ice cream drizzled with chocolate sauce and rice crispies..  The cost is out there but every once in a while it's good to splurge on something this good.  Thanks Bobby!",

It's as beautiful as it is tasty. My favorite is the chiliqueles with his savory grits.  My brothers favorite is the salmon dish. My sister in laws favorite is his burger's. The service is great and the restaurant is very clean. I hope by the grace of God I run into him there someday soon. That would be amazing!!!",

Amongst all the food network stars Bobby flat stands out to me because he concentrates more on flavor than fat and meat, like the others do.we ordered the quest fundido- which was out of the world good. The mushroom quesedilla was amazing as well. The chili relleno however felt dry to the palette and the eggplant inside was undercooked plus the plate was pretty on on side and sloppy on the other side, the salmon sandwich was ok, didn't live up to my expectations, I've had better.the drinks were very good! So my rating would be 3 for the bad dishes and 5 for the good ones so averaging it out to 4 :)",

I will say the food is excellent so if you are going ONLY for the food then you are the right spot. The Queso Fundido and the Tuna Nachos were excellent. The steak was flavorful but not to die for.  The service was ok, not great.     My biggest disappointment was the lack of choices for wine by the glass.   Any of the good choices were by the bottle and extremely for overpriced for the labels they offered. If you are the only wine drinker in the group it sucks.  It seemed a shame not to have a really good glass of wine to compliment the dishes.   Lastly if you still want to go after reading this then be sure to make your reservation about a week before you get there or expect to eat really, really late.",

I worked with their insurance company on a small, and I mean very small, claim.  They denied the claim today.  Just a warning, that if you eat there and get food poisoning - please notify the health department and the restaurant management as soon as possible so documentation can be made about the event.  The more documentation the better.  I believe more people get food poisoning that just goes unreported because they believe it was from something else.

Expensive for the portion size, but as expected for its premium location and brand name. I heard other patrons complain about their food as I walked out.  Maybe an off day given all of the great reviews, but I honestly would have gotten better SW/mex from chipotle. My dining companions thought it was OK, not worth the price.",

This is one of Bobby Flay's restaurants located inside Caesar's Palace, and man, he puts some awesome dishes on the menu!  For all you carb fans, the bread basket here is fantastic! It's filled with jalapeno sourdough, cornbread muffins, and raisin bread. Many of the appetizers looked good, but after seeing the portions of other entrees coming out, my husband and I thought we would try to save any extra room we had for dessert instead.   The last time I came here, I ordered the cornmeal encrusted chili relleno, and though it was excellent (and the prettiest chili relleno I ever saw on a plate), I wanted to try something new this time. I opted for the mango spice encrusted tuna steak served on a bed of couscous with mango chunks and pine nuts. Holy deliciousness, Batman! The flavors of this dish just explode in your mouth!  My husband ordered a veal chop, which was equivalent to the size of his head. No joke... check the pictures I posted. It came with a side of blue cheese smashed tamale, which was both interesting and tasty.  What little room we saved for dessert, we decided to go with something seasonal... pumpkin! So we ordered a pumpkin tartlet topped with a scoop of pumpkin ice cream and a dulce de leche sauce. We were both happy we saved room for that. :)  I would not hesitate to come here a third time after two wonderful dining experiences. Thanks, Bobby!",

I had the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin, which is supposively a Bobby Flay signature dish. The flavors were nice, a little spicy but to be honest it was undercooked... They said it's supposed to be served rare, but this was pretty undercooked for pork in my opinion. I wouldn't order this particular dish again and would exercise caution if you don't like rare pork.   I would definitely come back, the rest of the menu looked great and the service was pretty good, a lil slow but we were sitting in the bar/lounge area.",

With that said, the first time I went to Mesa Grill, I was completely ready to have a totally rotten time just to reinforce my opinion of Bobby and give me bitching rights for the future.  Mr. Flay, my humble apology.  You may be a turd on TV, but you have a great restaurant and I've been back multiple times with guests.  The vibe is cool.  Just enough isolation from the casino floor to make dining intimate, but a sweeping and impressive view of the sports book in the background that looks like NASA's mission control.  The tuna nachos and the duck laden Blue corn pancakes are fabulous.  The pork loin and the filet are both must haves as is the side dish of chorizo-feta tamales.  Service has always been punctual, but nonintrusive, that's professionalism.  I've always been accommodated for a late notice reservation, even during hectic CES.  My only, purely selfish, complaint is that you no longer offer those truly wonderful caipirinhas.  Maybe something to reconsider?  You did them well.  Thanks a lot Bobby for making me almost like you!  Your restaurant is the great persuader - Great meals, all.",

    "text": "Maybe I'm just not a fan of Bobby Flay's Southwestern inspired cuisine, but my experience wasn't the most enjoyable. I would give my experience a 3.5, but rounding down in rating because I don't think it deserved the full 4 stars.  The best part about my night was the bread basket. My friend and I shamelessly asked for another basket once we devoured through the first one. The blue corn muffins and the raisin bread was my favorite!  As for entree, I ordered the Chile Relleno. As a vegetarian, in terms of entrees, that was my only choice. I could have ordered 2 appetizers instead, but nothing on the appetizer menu piqued my interest. The Chile Relleno was fairly spicy and I was not expecting that at all. I wish my server had given me a little bit of a warning. Of course, there is some level of spice to be expected when ordering a stuffed chili, but the majority of the heat came from the bed of red pepper sauce. It was so spicy, I could only eat half of it.  My friend ordered the Queso Fundido, which was a Flay specialty, and the Chicken Skewers. She seemed to enjoy her food a lot more than I did.   The service was adequate, nothing extraordinary. My friend and I had to wait 15 minutes at the bar despite having a reservation. Once seated, our (blase) waiter did a pretty good job explaining the signature menu items - but that was the most enthusiasm that came from him for the remainder of the night. I went for dinner on Sunday night and the place was pretty packed.   Personally, I would pass on this place since it was nothing special. But if you're a die-hard Bobby Flay fan, you may enjoy this restaurant much more than I did.",

Started off with the Tiger shrimp +roasted garlic corn tamale which was the bomb to the lobster with the hominy cakes topped with Fresno chile butter sauce which was worth every damn penny! The desserts we ordered was the chocolate sticky toffee pudding cake and the pistachio brown butter cake. If you've ever wanted a foodgasmn, I suggest you try that chocolate sticky pudding cake and the tiger shrimp tamale. We all ate off each others plate so everything from Mesa grill was on point! The filet Mignon, the crusted pork tenderloins, the pesto mash potatoes,the cornmeal crusted chile relleno and the drinks....all delicious! The waiters were knowledgeable and funny and the service was great! We had Paul as our waiter. He was the best! He made everything sound so delicious when we asked him what was in each dish that we ended up ordering whatever he was describing,and it did not disappoint. I've wanted to try this place out for years,and now that I have I would gladly go back and spend my check here . Sometimes it's good to just treat ourselves.",

Had read that the Tiger Shrimp tamale was the favorite Vegas food for Michael Simon and because the restaurant is owned by Bobby Flay, we knew it must be special.  Ordered it as our appetizer and it was wonderful!  At the recommendation of our server we got the shrimp tacos for lunch and they were good as well.  I only wish we could have gone back to try the duck blue corn pancake appetizer and the entree rabbit - ran out of time and free evenings.  Next time for sure!

We ordered the queso dip as an appetizer, which was the best item we tried.  Savory cheese with slivers of marinated jalapeno, scooped with blue corn chips.  That was some good shiznick.    As for the rest of the items we ordered, it was nothing fabulous.  I had a burger, which was cooked well, but lacked a bit in the seasoning department.  I thought that the Southwestern Fries were quite tasty however, but again nothing mind-shattering.    The service here was pretty atrocious.  It took approximately 30 minutes after we ordered our food to see our actual entrees--some burgers and sandwiches.  The place wasn't even packed, so I don't believe that there was any excuse for such a delay in service.  On the upside, however, the slow service saved me from throwing away another $5 in a slot machine (I'm no gambler).  Maybe dinner at Mesa is better--given how much I think about Bobby Flay, I'll probably try this place again next time I return to Sin City.",

I suggest splitting a few appetizers before your entree (blue corn duck pancakes, tiger shrimp tamales). You get a variety of fresh bread and muffins before you order. Good wine selection and strong cocktails. I've ordered the Ribeye twice... once it was the best steak I ever had the second time it was a little too fatty. Filet minon is good as well. I don't normally order desserts but you have to at MESA. Churro's, coconut cake etc are great... The menu choices change with the seasons. If you go with a large party 10 or more you get a private room. PS- Make reservations at least 30 days in advance!",

Okay, so we get there and are greeted with friendly staff and were seated right away.  Looking over the menu we realize it's not exactly kid-friendly. (our mistake for not checking ahead of time). I also notice it's a bit priciey but we are on a budget so we forgo the appetizers..She and I both order lunch on the lower end of the menu. I order the Mesa Burger and she ordered the New Mexican Spiced Tenderloin sandwich.  Trying to decide what to order for her son, the waiter suggested a sirloin steak that was not on the menu.  So we order the sirloin.  (my daughter does ask how much it was but I guess he didn't hear her and she didn't repeat herself. ) My daughter also wanted one of Bobby Flay's signed cookbooks so we added that to our order.  I get the check and almost fall out of my chair!  The steak for my 10 year old grandson was about $48.00 and no, Bobby Flay didn't cook it himself.  (I would pay extra for that and eat it myself)   Ok, so I pay the bill and ditch the book. I was upset that the waiter didn't mention that the steak was as much as it was.  He knew it was for a kid! I took it out on his tip.  I really think he should have said something.    Food was good, actually, food was fantastic but soooo not happy with waiter.",

Update:  I went to Mesa Grill for a 3rd time and had to downgrade two stars.  They removed my favorite dish:  the coffee been rubbed steak, so my steak became average and please don't give me steak sauce unless you're serving me a piece of leather.  I was also disappointed by the sides.  The cauliflower au gratin was gross and the butternut squash tamale is wimpy.",

Entrees:  Spicy chicken and sweet hash-it has two poached eggs on top and itss delicious! kind of on the breakfast side and its an explosion of flavor in your mouth. Little chicken chunks and sweet potatoes. Great sauce, but you could only eat so much, it was really overpowering. Grilled Mahi- Mahi with pinapples - DRY!!! dont reccommend  Mesa burger -- HUGE reg. burger.. Try the Garlic Mayo Steak Sandwhich-- juicy yummy reccommend!  Dessert: my Birthday cake :) Warm chocolate cake--- cake was RICHH, Macroon was delicious(I LOVE MACROONS), Ice cream complemented the cake extremely well and the presentation was beautiful!

My honest evaluation has to be this: I don't know enough about southwest, pepper-grilled food to be a good judge of it.   As it would turn out, the Tiger Prawn Tamale, the Smoked Pumpkin Pie Soup, and the Wet-Rub Grouper would all taste the same. Do not get me wrong, the food tasted fantastic, its presentation flawless. However to my novice taste it all seemed...hot. Having a terrible habit of drinking too much water when eating only made the meal more difficult to enjoy considering every bite was followed by a deep exhale and a slug of ice water.",

I was already hyped about going here during EZ-P and J-Ho's birthday celebration weekend (aka the EZ-Ho weekend).  I was looking for any crack in the hull to sink Mesa Grill's ship but I simply couldn't find one.  Scurrying through the dining area, I peered through the big kitchen windows to see if Flay was in the house (and he wasn't).  I loved that the place was relatively casual, and not pretentious.  Decor was simple, nothing to really distract you away from your meal.  The wait staff was attentive, informed, friendly, and even precognitive a couple times!  Chimay is on the beer list, causing my eyes to well up in sheer joy.  We shared the shrimp tamale signature dish, which was impossibly bold and delicate at the same time.  My lamb porterhouse chops with chimichurri sauce were great, nicely medium rare, seasoned well.  The sauce was well executed though I must say the chops didn't taste as good after I tried EZ-P's signature pork dish which was extraterrestrial far as flavors go.  I will be back and I will have that dish then.  Ehh, what the hell, you had me at Chimay...  I would've loved to see Flay fall on his face, but dammit, I guess not this time!",

    "text": "Hats off to Bobby Flay, I didn't find it overrated...yeah!:  Food - 4.5  stars Service - 4 stars Performace/Cost - 4.5 stars  I was somewhat reserved from going here initially since I've heard just about hundred times from others (including Bobby himself) how quintessentially southwestern delicious the dishes that they offer at this place were.  But I semi-refused to conclude that it was all that before I saw it with my two eyes.  We walked in a little bit after the normal lunch time (totally the way to go if you want to get some decent service at this busy and exposed venue at Caesars) - chilled with some margarita and a basket full of tasty breads (including the jalapeno mini biscuits which are my absolutely favorite).  The margarita was very satisfying - tangy, not to sweet, and just the right zing.    My friends ordered the southwestern burger and the home fries as well as the filet of salmon with the sweet potato cakes.  I ordered the scrambled eggs prepared southwestern style with the fried tortillas, cheese, and the salsa embedded underneath the eggs (oh heavens...).  I'd have to say that all three were equally tasty and cooked just right.  None of the dishes were greasy, salty, or clashing with each other.  It was southwestern at its best.  I was fearing that it'd be just a fancy version on typical mexican dishes...but their interpretations of the classic southwestern dishes were quite impressive...based on the taste of each of the dishes.  Too bad we were too full to taste the mexican donuts (i reckon we could have really done it if we wanted to)...but we wanted to empty our stomachs for the wine and dine at bouchon that night so we held our own at that moment.    Overall a very pleasant experience, I'd definitely come back here to eat and also spread the word that it's NOT an overrated restaurant with the face of a celebrity chef nowhere to be seen.",

For the entrees, we got the pork tenderloin, which was amazing. Super tender and flavorful, and it came with a yam mash. We also got the rabbit, which was surprisingly really good, because I was never too fond of rabbit meat. We also got the salmon, which was good not great, and we also got the 22oz steak, which was good, but it didn't come with anything else like mashed potatoes or anything. So having a huge steak with nothing to go with it was kinda not great, so we got a side of spinach, which was pretty good for nothing but spinach. We also got a baked potato, which was super different from your standard baked potato. It was in between mashed and baked, really soft. It had TONS of flavor; the flavor of horseradish was a bit strong but it was really good.",

    "text": "I came here last Sunday with some friends for brunch as one of them wanted to eat here because he's a fan of the TV show Iron Chef it's by Bobby Flay.  I can definitely say that the food here was good but was it the best thing I've ever eaten?  I don't think so...  For brunch, I went with the shrimp tamale for a started and then rounded out my meal with the pork tenderloin sandwich.  The tamale was really good though a bit pricey at $15 and only came with 4 shrimp.  I guess when you eat at a \"celebrity\" chef's place, things will cost more.  But what if I don't even know who this \"celebrity\" chef is, you ask?  It doesn't matter, you're still going to pay celebrity chef prices but since it was good, I can say that the taste justified the cost.  The sauce they use with the tamale was great - I had to mix in the corn from the tamale with the sauce and shrimp and it hit the spot.  As for the tenderloin sandwich, it was pricey as well at $16 but it was also good.  The meat was really tender and flavored really well.  I thought the ancho chile mayonnaise they used for this sandwich was excellent as it was a combination of sweet, salty, and spicy!!  The fries were also really good with the southwestern spices they used and had the right crunch to them.  The meal was definitely filling and it took me some time to kill all the fries but in the end, they were gone.  I was too stuffed to even try a cocktail but my friend tried one of their margaritas and said it was good and had a lot of alcohol for $11.  Anyways, I would probably come back but not right away as there are so many other good places to eat in Vegas.",

    "text": "By far the worst meal we had in Vegas.  When we arrived to place our reservation in person (after no one answered the phone) we were ignored for several minutes by two hosts who were having a personal conversation.  Our waiter took the rude to a whole new level. He didn't even acknowledge my wife for close to ten minutes, speaking solely to and making eye contact only with me. He actually dropped his \"game face\" before out of eyesight after leaving the table and rolled his eyes.  The meal started off well with decent margaritas (although the bar only accepts cash or room-charges). The meal then quickly deteriorated. After enjoying some good bread and muffin (one muffin for two people) we had a chicken quesadilla for an appetizer, which was tasty, but overly salty. I ordered the lamb medium rare and it came raw and purple. My wife ordered the sixteen spice chicken which was sickly sweet. Tried the cioppino...it was edible at best. Overly fishy smelling in general with mussels that were certainly past their prime. Overall, the food was overly sweet and generally bad.  If you want to experience a good $100 plus meal in vegas don't eat here. There are much better places worth your time and money. I recommend B & B Ristorante in the Venetian.",

    "text": "When I found out that two of my friends were going to be getting married in Las Vegas, I immediately turned to my fiance and told him I was going to Mesa Grill, with or without him. Bobby Flay holds a very special place in my heart, so I was not about to miss a chance to dine at one of his restaurants.  Cut to Vegas: all of our friends were trying to make plans for the first night of what to do in Vegas, and my fiance leaked what our dinner plans were. Oh, Mesa Grill, remember that reservation for 2? Yeah, can you change it for a party of 14? 'K, thanks! But seriously, I love large groups at dinner, it just makes everything so much more enjoyable. We were broken up into two groups (6 and 8), and were across the restaurant from each other, which was okay because we changed our reservations, and they were as accommodating as they could be.  We ordered a variety of appetizers, and hands down, the best one was the tiger shrimp in garlic cream sauce. The entire table could not stop talking about how great it was. Not to say the other appetizers weren't also tasty, it just that I can't remember what they were because the shrimp was so good.  Onto the entree. I don't really care for red meat, and you can never go wrong with chicken, but I figured since I was in Vegas, I should try something new. I ordered the Yucatan grouper with Blue Crab succotash sauce. Deliciousness! The best part was, as each person dish came out, we were all drooling, and literally starting passing our plates around so everyone could have a sample of everyone else's dish.   We were full, but found a way to make some room for this very tasty molten chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream. When we met up with our other table of friends after our dinner, they all looked at me and thanked me for making reservations because their experience was just as satisfying as ours.  All in all, Mesa Grill was the BEST meal I ever had in my life, from start to finish. Bobby Flay has now ruined me for all other restaurants, celebrity or otherwise. Thank you very much for living up to, and exceeding all of my expectations.",

I've been here a few times and I've had both good and bad food experiences here (I feel like I should be specific because the service was always stellar).  Is it that their dinner menu is a tad bit better than their lunch?  The best and most interesting appetizer they have is the blue corn pancake with duck.  It was absolutely delicious, but nothing you can't get at a decent dim sum place.  Sure, it has that southwestern twist but it gets lost in the richness of flavor from the duck.  You can skip the quesadilla here -- it was a really boring food experience.  My favorite entree here is the chicken and mango dish.  It was flavorful and fun to eat.  The steak sandwich I had here for lunch was downright awful, though!  I took three bites, and that's as far as I could go.  What a waste.  The mesa burger here is good, but the chile relleno is average.    Honestly, the food they dish out here isn't worth the high prices on the menu.  But hey -- you're on the Strip so everything is overpriced anyway.  Overall, I suppose this place is a must stop for Food Network fans in the area.  Just don't let Bobby Flay's clout hype up this place for you, or you will be disappointed.",

The mango and perfect portion size of the nachos were just right, the lamb chops were cooked perfect and I loved that they were garnished with mint and jalapeno, a nice little kick. I'll definitely be back! I'd also like to mention that I agree with other yelpers, the hostess staff is pretty terrible, we had a reservation and didn't get seated until about 25 minuets after it and there were plenty of open tables, but can't knock the food or the amazing service from our server for that.",

It had a sauce that was pared with it but the meat itself had an amazing taste.

Now that I have completely allowed everybody reading this review to delve into my immense reservoir of cheapness I will finish the review.  Bobby Flay...yadda yadda yadda.  Food Network...yadda yadda yadda.  Great food at Mesa Grill.  Yes!  Amazing food at that.  First, make a reservation...even if you don't think it will be packed.  For some reason many people believe Flay is actually cooking at this restaurant, which is strange seeing that he has many restaurants around the country.  So...needless to say the restaurant is usually packed with people.  Also, the restaurant is smack dab in the middle of Caesars sports book...so do not make this meal a romantic evening.  Make this meal a meal about the good food.  I can just see myself proposing to my girlfriend \"Will you marry me?\"...with the sounds of \"Run you worthless piece of $#%@!\"...echoing behind me.  But I digress.  Onto the food.  Appetizer.  Get the tuna nachos.  It is raw tuna mixed with pico and cilantro and other spices.  These tuna pieces come with nacho chips.  I know what you are thinking....raw tuna nachos?  I swear this is perhaps the best thing in the entire restaurant...if you forget about the Shrimp Tacos, the Burgers, and desserts.  I HATE raw fish.  I HATE tuna.  I LOVE Mesa Grill's Tuna Nachos.  I don't know why that is. It is one of life's great mysteries...along with UFOs, mind control, and the JFK assasination.    Another great selection is the shrimp tacos.  Cilantro in abundance.  I love freakin cilantro.  Even if you do not like cilantro very much you will notice how the herb enhances the taste of the shrimp.  The cilantro and spices are the star of this dish....not the shrimp.  Although the shrimp are far superior than many shrimp on the strip.  That sentence rhymed and when you begin sounding like Dr. Seuss it is time to end the review.  One other thing.  The statue of the boxer out front of Mesa Grill is actually Joe Louis.  I tried to look like a man's man in front of my fiance by saying \"Look at the Ali statue\" but had to cower in wussiness when she realized I was an idiot when it came to boxing.  I know Tennis and Soccer really well....call me a wuss whatever.  Go to Mesa Grill!",

Lunch started with the Goat Cheese 'Queso Fundito'... which was so good that it distracted me from my entree for about half the meal. But that doesn't mean that my entree - the smoked shrimp tacos + salsas - wasn't also awesome. Wash it down with a couple beers and I was good to go! This would probably be a repeat visit sort of place if there weren't a gazillion other options on the strip.",

We were lucky enough to snag a reservation while we were in Vegas, and I'm so glad we did! Here's the breakdown:   Drinks: A+  Hottie: A Manhattan with Pappy Van Winkle- He was very excited about it! Me: Not sure the name, but it had Charbay Grapefruit Vodka, Cranberry Juice, Grapefruit and lime, refreshing and delicious!  Appetizer: A+ Shared: Goat Cheese and Queso Fundido : Perfect concoction of gewy, salty, and creamy, served with fresh made chips! We had to fight over the last bite.   Dinner: A- (Didn't taste Hotties)  Hottie: Pork Tenderloin with Sweet potato tamale (He ate every bite!) Me: Mushroom Quesadilla and a side of Brussel sprouts.   The Quesadilla was excellent, but very rich.  The Brussel sprouts I didn't like, they had a weird taste to them that made me cringe, can't put my finger on what it was.    Dessert: A+++++++++ Toasted Coconut layer cake: OMG, we can never eat, drink or smell coconut again without thinking about this delicious moist, fabulous cake!  In fact I will never go to Vegas again and not eat that cake...",

The guest at the table next to us took notice and mentioned it to her server who (to her credit) proceeded to try and make up for the lack of customer service from our own server... That being said, we had the sweet potato soup, shrimp tamale, new mexico chili rubbed pork sandwich, deep dish banana cream pie, and toasted coconut cake.

I got their house margarita. It was the best margarita I have ever had! The tequila was amazing, and the tequila mixer was fresh and not too sweet.  For my entree I had the pork tenderloin, which was fantastic. I usually don't order pork tenderloin because it is too dry and tasteless. This one was actually tender and juicy! The sauce was not too overpowering and blended great with the rest of the dish.   This was worth every penny. It is in Caesar's Palace, so if you're on the strip you might as well make a reservation!",

We originally tried to walk in for dinner on a Friday night, but was told they were booked for the night.  The restaurant was almost completely empty, so I didn't really understand.  We returned again the next day to try brunch.  The brunch menu didn't seem very appealing to me, but we were starving and didn't want to go searching for something else.  To start we ordered the hash brown quesadilla.  I thought it was amazingly delicious.  The bacon had a nice smokey flavor and the fried egg just added to the flavor.  For entrees we got scrambled eggs chilaquile, sweet potato hash, mesa burger and the steak and eggs.  The steak and eggs is served with tortillas where you can build your own mini breakfast burrito.  The steak was cooked beautifully with the right amount of pink.  Chilaquile is served on a blue corn tortilla with creme fraiche.  The blue corn had a nice bold flavor and the whole dish meshed very well together.  Mesa burger was nothing special.  I was not a fan of the sweet potato hash, but that might be because I'm not too big on sweet potato.  However, no one was particularly fond of this dish so it can be skipped in my opinion.  The highlight of the meal was the hash brown quesadilla.  Overall I thought the pricing was a bit high for brunch and would not return again for brunch.  I would possibly return one day again for dinner though.",

I've eaten there several times, including this past week.   Reservations were tough to come by due to huge crowds at the CES show that week, but I grabbed a spot at the bar which doesn't require reservations.  I tried the veal chop upon the recommendation of the bar tender.  It was tender, perfectly cooked, and had great flavor.  It came with a goat cheese tamale.  I was a little skeptical of the tamale when I ordered, but it ended up being fantastic and as good of a tamale as I've had anywhere.    I had a couple of margaritas, which were good but nothing to write home about.  The price point is rather high, but not out of line with comparable establishments in Vegas.  On past visits I've also had the chipotle glazed rib eye and coffee rubbed filet, both of which were excellent.",

It made me feel good.  I deliberately decided where I wanted to eat out there for a supper that evening.  Oh, I forgot about the Mesa Grill.  Let me go there without having a hard decision to pick one of the most excellent restaurants in Vegas.  There are so many restaurants inside the Ceasers casino.  I walked all the way to the exact restaurant that I looked for.  It looked a whole woody decor inside the restaurant but it wasnt like a Southwest cultural influence. It's more like a woody cabin.  A Hispanic hostess greeted me to a table where I could sit down.  I looked up in a wine menu and looked for a glass of chardonnay from Napa. It wasn't available but was available for a bottle of chardonnay.  They have offered only white French wines for a glass.  I won't order a glass of French white wine.  I decided to skip it.   I ordered: Tiger Shrimps with corn tamale -- well-done shrimps, along with tamale(crushed corn flours), and sweet corn sauce with red pepper sauce(mild-hot).  And Cilantro Spice Chickens-- well-done chickens along mashed potatoes and cilantro sauce (sweet smoking spice flavor).  They are so delightful.  The breads included some pieces of jalapeno.    I'll go back there again for different kinds of meat and seafood.  Any cost on a dinner menu is expensive.  This restaurant is nothing comparable to other Mexican or Southwest restaurants because a variety of the Southwest flavors is the top-secret recipes.",

Forget for a second the dirty seats that looked like they hadn't been wiped down for quite some time, and the table cloth that was so considerately pre-soiled for us - with hair!  Now to the worst burger I think I've ever had. I did ask for well done but this sucker was cooked to death!  It was tough, dry and totally tasteless. The bun is way too big and might as well have been two hunks of styrofoam. Horrible!  There was absolutely nothing special about the Mesa burger at all and I would never recommend it to anyone.  I've had better burgers at McDonald's! The margs were ok but again, nothing special, especially for $16!  The mushroom quesadilla wasn't too bad but was smothered in way too much salsa and creme fraiche.  Save your money for something better. If you want a decent burger go elsewhere!   Another pathetic celebrity chef crappy restaurant.  These guys seem to care more about the money than the food anymore. (Gordon Ramsay!)",

It was PERFECTLY cooked.  The meat was soft and juicy and the rub had a very nice spicy kick to it.  Dip each piece into the Ancho Chile Sauce and you won't do anything else but smile with your eyes closed.  The plate comes with 3 tenderloin pieces (more like logs).  While they look small, they really do fill you up.  I couldn't finish the entire meal and ended up taking one piece home.  I heated it up in the microwave the next morning and actually ate it for breakfast the next day and it was STILL delicious.  I was extremely impressed since typically when you reheat meat in a microwave it will come out overcooked and dry, but not this tenderloin.  This is definitely a MUST TRY!!!",

The decor was average, however the most important aspects of service and food were outstanding.  The wait and bus staff was considerate to all of our needs and desires.  The actually name of the corn side dish I had is escaping me, however it had creme fraiche and a delicious mix of seasonings.  I didn't think I would ever try to find a recipe for corn online after eating at a restaurant but I did after Mesa Grill!  My meal consisted of a pork tenderloin seasoned and cooked to perfection and a delicious sweet potato tamale that we are still trying to imitate at home months later!  Going back the next time I am in Vegas for sure.",

The pork tenderloin is amazing, and I dont even like pork that much, I just tried it when someone else ordered it, and I might even order it next time I go back.  The rough cut nachos appetizer is an amazing starter, and not to be missed.  Everything else on the menu has always been great.  Even the simple stuff like the chile relleno is delicious.  This is one of my favorite places in Las Vegas, and I will continue to go back.",

The design is interesting and I discovered I only took photos of the bathroom, so think about that. lol. The complimentary breads were a nice touch and didn't taste like anything I had had before. I could care less about it being a Bobby Flay restaurant though, because that just jerks up the price to an unreasonable amount just for him being a celebrity... I mean, when your server first walks up to you and asks \"You know who Bobby Flay is, right?\" without saying hello, you need to sort your priorities...",

My typical process is to inform the waiter that this is my first visit and I would like to know what are the best/signature dishes. Some times I get the typical, \"everything is great\" response. So I follow up with my next question, \"When my friends back home find out I went to Mesa Grill, what is the one dish they're going to ask, DID YOU HAVE THE XXXX?\" With that in mind... we ordered the following  Appetizer: Tiger Shrimp with Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale   Entrees: Ancho-Chile Honey Glazed Salmon  New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin with sweet potato tamale  Sides: Roasted Corn with Chipotle Aioli Mashed Potatoes with Green Chili Queso Sauce  All outstanding",

After check-in, the hostess referred us to the bar while our table was prepared. As soon as we stepped into the bar, our drink orders (bar tab can be transferred to the table, way cool) were taken.  At the table our waiter was very knowledgable, friendly, and professional. We ordered the roasted sweet potato soup, and blue pancake (more like a crepe) with roasted duck with bbq sauce. Both appetizers were great. Our main course was New Mexico Spiced Pork Tenderloin, Lamb Chops, and Roasted Cauliflower Gratin with Pablano Chile, with wine pairing for each main dish. It was an amazing culinary experience!",

I will say, the duck appetizer was fantastic and I highly recommend it and the side dishes were also good, although $10 for a pretty small dish.  My big disappointment was my main dish.  I ordered the veal chop, which was huge.  I was so ready for this, but once I cut into it, it was pure fat.  And at $48 I was sick about it.  After cutting away about half of it, I finally gave up.  Didn't get much to eat.  And our waiter never came back to ask how our meals were, or I would have sent it back.  By the time he re-appeared, they had already cleared our plates, so I didn't say anything.  Needless to say, when my $94 bill arrived, I was not happy.  Don't think I will be returning any time soon.",

    "text": "Went here on Saturday night without reservations which was a mistake .... but the hostess said, \"We serve the full menu at the bar.\" We went immediately to the bar and got a comfortable seat. It was the first time we were at a Bobby Flay restaurant and were looking forward to a good meal.  The restaurant was modernly decorated. The noise level was high because of all the people, but it was still possible to have a conversation without raising my voice. It was really cool atmosphere. You could see into the kitchen right at the chefs doing the grilling too.  The bartender took good care of us and knew the food menu really well. I was joking with my buddy about getting a Flay cookbook and the bartender said \"Bobby will sign it for you. He's here in the kitchen. He was out here earlier.\" I walked over to take a look through the kitchen but didn't see him. I tried later too but no luck.  We started with a chicken quesadilla appetizer. Sounds pretty standard, but with the first bite the flavors just explode in your mouth. Goodness gracious I was not expecting that at all! The guac on the top was so fresh and had a hint of lime in it. There was an orangish sauce on it that had a nice kick and the chicken was grilled perfectly.  Our entree was a the pork tenderloin with a goat cheese tamale. The dish itself was presented artfully and with care. The pork was cooked medium and had a slightly pink center. The outside crust was a pleasant brown with drips of the orange sauce on the 3 pieces. Taking a first bite of the pork was heavenly. The rub on the outside had crusted up just right while the inside was tender. The barbeque sauce on the plate was a little sweet and a little tangy, but paired well with the spic, orange sauce. It was truly and enjoyable dish.  The only problem was that we were too full for dessert. And it would've been cool to see or meet Bobby in person.  The staff was excellent, friendly, un-pretentious. Worth the money and I'd go again.",

    "text": "My husband and I have been here twice now, and have great things to say. I personally loved the Cactus Pear Margarita, queso fundido, and mashed potatoes side with queso. The pork tenderloin is very good and I believe it's their signature dish. I enjoyed it but my husband didn't really care for the sauce it came with so it may not be for everyone. The Veal chop was very good, a little too fatty for me but I am extremely particular about fatty meats, more than most. My husband really enjoyed his rabbit dish during our most recent visit. My in-laws really liked the salmon and lamb they ordered, they weren't raving about their dishes, but they enjoyed and finished them. If you dine here, definitely order the queso fundido, have a margarita, and MOST DEFINITELY get the mashed potatoes. The next time I dine here, I plan on trying the chicken dish, so I will update my review when I do. FYI, the main dishes don't really come with sides, some have a small meatless tamale and I know the lamb comes with collared greens. The actual sides are sold separately.  Be aware, if you make a reservation you will need a credit card, and if for some reason you miss your reservation, you will be charged $50 for doing so. Be sure to not miss your reservation, or take your chances walking in. This place is on the pricey side, the first time I dined here with my husband we each had 1 drink, shared the queso, I had the pork, he had the veal, and we shared 1 order of mashed potatoes. After tip the bill was $150. When we ate here with the in-laws, our bill including tip was $360.  Each time we left roughly an 18-20% tip, the waiters are very knowledgeable about the menu's and always have recommendations. Very good service!  We will be back, but most likely for a splurge or special occasion.",

I liked watching the chefs in action cooking our food that was like free entertainment.  I had the pumpkin soup sorry can't recall the exact name it was smokey and creamy.  The only thing I did not like about it was that it was kind of on the sweet side but that's just me and my palate. It looked beautiful and they didn't skimp either.  I loved loved loved the Ancho salmon it was cooked perfect nice and flaky.  My hubby had the pork sandwich and all he could say was wow this is really good.  We also tried the goat fundio which was the perfect balance of goat and another cheese.  Goat cheese for me can be a bit overpowering so they got the balance just right. My one and only complaint was that our table was just too small to fit all our food and drinks. Hehe I can't wait to go back and try other things.  I was looking at the table next to us and they ordered the shrimp tamales those smelled delicious. Yes my husband is embarrassed of me when I look at other people's food but I can't help it.",

The meat was well seasoned and really juicy but the green chile didnt really add anything to the burger...  Everyone talks about Mesa Grill's Churros... I knew I wanted these but I wanted to check out the rest of the dessert menu too. I guess it bothered the server that I wanted to see the dessert menu before we finished our dinner because he kind of gave me an asshole look and said \"well we usually give those to you after you've finished your meal\". Listen jerk, I'm on vacation and if I wanted to eat dessert as my meal, with my meal or in lieu of my meal THEN I CAN!   Anyhoo they didnt even have the damn churros so everyone lost...  Overall, I was expecting more from this place. Dishes are hit or miss - some were awesome, some not so much.",

I wasn't sure what to eat either halibut or Mahi Mahi. I was gonna look on yelp but my phone died!!! No!!! Well I asked the waiter and he said the halibut. I Was so disappointed because the HALIBUT was SOOOOO DRY and no flavor at all. But the side of corn I got was amazing. Over all I would give it a 3 1/2 stars because of the bad recommendation by waiter.",

Mesa is located just off the casino floor of Caesar's and provides a good, but not great ambiance.  The flip side however is the feel is business casual versus formal, which is great for a Vegas trip where you don't want something too high brow.  Expect a full house, with plenty of noise.  The food is delicious.  We had the queso fundido, the chile relleno, a couple of sides, and a dessert I cannot recall the last time we went.  Everything was cleaned off the plate.  We felt the price was also very reasonable, relative to Vegas pricing.  Overall - for a great Mexican restaurant that will impress - we highly recommend.  PS - don't expect to see Bobby.  I hear he doesn't make it here too often.",

The prices are very reasonable (for a Las Vegas celebrity restaurant), and flavors jump off of the plate.  My most recent meal there was a corn and shrimp tamale appetizer and a chicken and sweet potato hash topped with poached eggs.  The tamale was the best I've ever had.  If you're there, you have to get a margarita or two; they're incredibly fresh tasting, and really make the tequila shine.  I will eat at Mesa Grill each time I'm in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "In Caesar's Palace, down Cleopatra's Way and across from the pirate boat, you'll find Mesa Grill.  If you're a fan of Bobby Flay, you would pay a visit too.  We came without reservations and waited 20 minutes.  We tried our hand at gambling but failed miserably and walked away with $2.  Bobby Flay is the boy next door and is known for his crazy spicy tex-mex dishes.  This restaurant could use a face lift.  I didn't care for the primary colors and the decor but I wasn't here for the decor, just the food.  Boy meets grill here indeed.  We got started with blue corn muffins and an appetizer of chicken tacos.  They were three tiny tacos but absolutely delicious and mouth watering.  The peanut BBQ sauce was delicious and had pieces of chopped peanuts that added a sweet touch to the tacos. Our main course was the Chile Rellano and Pork Tenderloin with a side of mashed potatoes.   The Pork Tenderloin was served with an ancho chile sauce that was hot and topped with a pecan butter sauce and plated with a sweet potato tamale.  My Chile Rellano was a chile stuffed with eggplant and cheese.  It was drizzled with sweet red pepper sauce and balsamic vinegar.  I don't really like eggplant but paired up with a chile and manchego cheese and a superb cornmeal crust; I was in heaven.  The mashed potato side was topped with a green chile queso sauce that was absolutely mouth watering. We devoured that as soon as it hit the table.  Our only wish is that the blue corn muffins were served warm but we can overlook that.  We didn't have room for dessert but we were licking our fingers after a superb 5 star meal.  This is a pricey meal - almost $100 for the two of us but it was worth it.",

Tiger shrimp+roasted garlic corn tamale: 4/5: shrimp was not the plumpest. it was also very salty. however, the tamale was exceptionally delicious. i generally strongly dislike tamales but ordered this due to the waiter's recommendation and despite the overly salty shrimp, i thought it was very good overall.  new mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin: 5/5: i personally didn't love it but i do appreciate that it was an excellently executed dish. pork cooked perfectly. seasoned with a nice ancho chile kick. the tamale, again, to delicious! mesa grill may have changed my opinions on tamales altogether.   side of corn: 4/5: again, well executed, but personally didn't love it. overall, i've had better.   drink: had thier signature margarita...nothing special at all. had a cucmber seomthing drink that was very refreshing.  i highly doubt i would return but i think that's more because of a personal preference, not because the restaurant was lacking in any way. overall, well executed dishes. well seasoned. good service. with exceptional tamales!!",

We were a party of four and our bill (with tip) came to $400 and this is what we got.. We loved the jalapeno bread in the bread basket but the jalapeno corn bread crumbled in our hands and was dry. Sophie's cobb salad (good and different but I would not order it again). Goat cheese dip (loved it) The regular margaritas were okay but the pear margarita was delicious. New York strip steak was dry in the middle and my daughter-in-law left a lot of it on her plate and did not want to take any of it home. Ribeye steak was not a good cut of meat at all.  It was gristly and had a lot of fat. My husband didn't care to eat all of it and said he's had a lot better at other places. My son and I had the coffee rubbed filet mignon and it was excellent. The sides are additional.  The twice baked potato was good. The tamale was not very good and was not finished. The corn and cilantro was pretty tasty.  I so wanted to love this restaurant and am sad that I am compelled to write this review. We think that a fair price for the quality of food should have been about $150. The margaritas were very over priced and small as well.  Our servers were pleasant and professional.  I can now check this off my bucket list and we will not be going back.  :(",

After a long, hard night of drinking the night before, we had some hair of the dog in the form of a spicy Bloody Mary & a cucumber-strawberry cocktail.  Both drinks were well-loved and lightened the mood.  The service was very friendly & the food was excellent.  You must try the Tiger Shrimp (the tamale it comes with is divine).  The grits are possibly the best thing on the menu.  Despite how pedestrian grits may sound, their texture is perfect and they are mixed with some delicious cheese.  UMAMI!  Order them.  One bone to pick with the place:  they don't like to make substitutions because of the way they run their kitchen.  I was able to get the poached eggs w/ green chile hollandaise a la carte, but the waiter told us that it's a rarity for them to do so.  I would absolutely come back, but it might be for brunch again since it's so much cheaper than the dinner menu.",

We had several appetizers, the Queso Fundido and the smoked chicken black bean quesadilla being the favorites, and lots of entrees, with the rib-eye and the duck breast getting the most acclaim. Even the bread was delectable.   But what prevented Mesa Grill from getting five stars? The desserts! We were so surprised when the desserts came out and none of us liked them. We had chocolate corn bread pudding, two warm apple pies, churros and a fourth dessert that I can't name at the moment (I'm staring at it in a picture and I still can't name it).   Out of the four, the warm apple pie was the best of the worst.. The churros tasted more burned than anything else, and the chocolate corn bread pudding was more corn than chocolate or bread pudding.  What happened Booby Flay? Mesa could have gotten five stars, but dessert was a total miss. If new desserts were to be created for Mesa Grill, I will gladly change my rating from 3 to 5 stars. Please concoct new desserts! ASAP!  Good: The bread, the appetizers, and the delectable entrees.  Bad: Dessert.   Final: Bobby Flay! Make some good desserts! PLEASE!!!",

Apple salad with bleu cheese - delicious, but beware: the bleu cheese flavor is extra strong. If you enjoy strong cheeses like me, however, you'll definitely enjoy this dish.   Coffee crusted steak sandwich - the name screams flavor. Unfortunately, the only flavor I could taste was the onion. I was greatly disappointed with the coffee crusted steak because there was absolutely no coffee flavor. The sandwich was unimpressive and something I could make at home.   Pork tenderloin sandwich - now THIS is the sandwich to get. It is much tastier than the steak sandwich. The flavor were much better. I also heard from the table next to me that the Cuban burger was the best burger they have ever had.   The chicken hash (not sure of the exact name but it had egg hollandaise on it) - the best dish on the table. The flavours melded together beautifully and I would get this dish if I return.   The fries that came with the sandwiches were good. Very salty though.   The bread and the corn muffin was super delicious. I would definitely come back for lunch because the prices were okay and not too obnoxious. I would recommend this place but do NOT order the steak sandwich.",

    "text": "Seriously good. I'll start out by saying my ideal flavor profile for food has always matched Bobby Flay's cooking. From the start, the service was great and the waitress had great recommendations and patience (everything sounded tasty). The bread basket contains a mixture of breads (one on the sweeter side, one more savory consisting of cheese and jalepeno, and a corn bread muffin). The veal chop (with bone) and wild rice tamale were excellent. Great flavors and perfectly cooked. The margarita that I had was tasty too. Overall fantastic experience. I'd love to give it 5, but I only upgrade when I've visited multiple times and can test the consistency.",

It was covered in a sweet sauce (similiar to the one on asian salads) that overwhelmed the entire dish.  YUCK!  My friend ordered the salmon and it was not spectacular nor despicable...just ok.  We didn't have to wait long for a seat since it was a slow Monday afternoon. The service was professionaly great.  The bright colored southern modern decor was very Bobby Flay and it was priced like Bobbly Flay too (meaning it was expensive).  I would come back here for burger and nothing else...and get it to go too.",

    "text": "I'm a huge Bobby Flay fan so couldn't wait to try Mesa Grill when we visited Vegas recently. The reservation system is a bit of a pain, you call a central line for everything at Caesars and then have to say the name of the property that you are trying to make a reservation for. I had to call a couple of times because we had to make a change to our reservation, and every time it sent me to the wrong place on the first 1 or 2 tries. I was finally able to successfully connect to the correct reservations folks though and once I got through everything went smoothly.   We had a party of 6 and everyone loved their meal. Our friends were ordering wine by the glass and the server recommended a very nice bottle instead which was surprisingly affordable. Everyone loved their meal.   My DH and I started with the shrimp tamales since there were so many recommendations for them here and they are 1 of the 2-3 items that the waiter said have been on the menu since day 1. I thought they were very good, but wasn't blown away by them. Then we shared the coffee rubbed rib eye and the green chili cauliflower. both were outstanding. The steak was nicely charred on the outside and perfectly medium rare. The rub had a combination of savory and sweet in it and there were 2 sauces. A spicy green sauce and some kind of red sauce. They were both very good but the green on was my favorite. The cauliflower was to die for! I also had tastes of the salmon which was perfectly cooked and had a really lovely sauce and the pork tenderloin which has a very tasty rub. The fish portions seemed to be about average size, but the pork and steak portions were huge. our steak was 22 ounces, which was plenty for the 2 of us.   Mesa Grill is definitely worth a second visit.",

Seafood ciappino with tipper prawns, scallops, grouper and mussels.  And a garlic and a sweet potato tamale, both very good.  Sides were baby carrots and mashed potatoes, both very good, especially the carrots.   Only reason not 5stars is that the appetizers were not as good as the rest or very good value.",

    "text": "My expectations may have been somewhat inflated as I sat down to dinner at Mesa Grill. The food was really good, though I wouldn't say it gave me an apres dinner foodgasm.   We started with the tiger shrimp app with a roasted garlic corn tamale. It was flavorful and well spiced. I dare say it was the most interesting part of my meal. As a main we shared the lamb, which was quite good, with goat cheese tamales that disappointed all around. I mean, points for the intention (tamales AND goat cheese! I expected to be in heaven! What happened?). The mashed potatoes and queso were sinful. The toffee bread pudding was delicious, but I couldn't help but compare it to another restaurant's to-die-for toffee pudding, and it didn't quite reach that level.  Since I'm a fan of keeping it real, my first impression of Mesa Grill is that it would really shine if it were one price point lower and stayed in the mid $20s to low $30s range. Of course, you're paying for the casino experience and the fact that it's Bobby Flay's baby. Maybe I'll get another go at Mesa in the future and try some other dishes. I will say there were a lot of good-looking choices on the menu.",

Being a spinach lover I ordered a side of spinach, worst spinach EVER! I couldn't eat it.

The smoked chicken and black bean quesadilla was super delicious - smoky and cheesy and bursting with flavor.  I had the striped bass and my husband had the pork tenderloin.  Our friends had a steak and the venison.  My fish was my least favorite of the four dishes, but still really good.  The pork was awesome, absolutely so much flavor and our friends went nuts over the venison and steak.  No dessert because we were so full.

Am not a big fan of Bobby Flay - being of the opinion that he is the Ryan Seacrest of the Food Network.  But Mesa Grill did not disappoint - the food was cooked well, tasty and creative.  I was happily surprised by the meal.  Knowing how Bobby Flay likes lobsters, chili, corn and alcohol, I had the paella dish - all the seafood was cooked perfectly and a drink called the black widow - All of which was tasty.  The restaurant itself has great acoustics - for being filled on a Saturday night, you could actually hear the person next to you and not all the conversations around you.  Service was ehh - our waiter reeked of alcohol and was not the most attentive.",

But the next day we ended up eating for lunch, and got in without waiting.  I'm expecting it to be with LOTS of Bobby Flay-esque style and design.  He seems to like the mexican flair, color scheme was of the red, green, white, yellow and orange spectrum...  The waiting area was pretty nice, and the dining room inside was pretty nice...   Food was VERY TASTY...  The blue corn pancake which had barbecued duck was definitely a single appetizer portion.  But even still, it was a small portion.  Then he had the Smoked Shrimp Tacos & Salsas and I had the Mesa Grill Burger.  The Shrimp Tacos was also a small portion.  It barely filled him up.  Luckily I couldn't finish my burger, and luckily I split it in half already.  Funny thing, the other tables surrounding us, had ordered the same things we ordered.  But overall, his food is very tasty...  I noticed as far as accompaniments with main dishes, they all seemed kinda on the spicy side...  I'm not too crazy on spicy...  but what we ordered was pretty good...  Be prepared, prices are on the \"Vegas\" side... A little pricey but pretty average for Vegas...  It's a worth check see, especially if you're a Bobby Flay Fan...",

He's not a \"celebrity chef\" with a tv personality but mediocre culinary skills - he's the real deal. First, the service was impeccable. We were greeted and seated immediately by the hostess and every need we could have had was anticipated and catered to by our waiter and sommellier. Second, the setting was very warm and open (this is the type of place where one is made to feel welcome whether he is wearing jeans or a three piece suit). Third, and most important, the food was delicious. Between my friend and I, we had the Baby Romaine Salad, Coffee Rubbed Filet Mignon (to die for), New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin, Mashed Potatoes with Green Chile Queso Sauce (another favorite), Fresh Corn Tamales, and Toasted Coconut Layer Cake. Every bit of the meal was delicious and I truly couldn't have asked for a better dining experience.

    "text": "We ate dinner at Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill. What a disappointment! To begin with, the walls are not complete (I don't mean \"finished\") and there are purposeful gaps which let a lot of the Casino smoke smell into the dining area. I was seated with my back against a wall and it really put a damper on my food to have the smell of smoke accompany it. The food? Plain bad. Every dish that we ordered was saturated in a strong sauce, rendering the actual \"food\" (duck, calamari, chicken) tasteless. The diners to the right of us were overheard voicing the same complaint. My husband Jon's Venison was overcooked and dry. He complained and we received a coconut layer cake free of charge for dessert. Ironically, this cake was the reason that I had booked a dinner at this restaurant in the first place, and it too was dry and disappointing. I much prefer the European way - where a restaurant IS the chef, and the chef is actually in the kitchen overseeing/cooking and being an active part. Bobby Flay owns and operates this restaurant. Sure, he probably cooks there also, from time to time. But given all that we know he does (Food Network, Cookbooks, other restaurants...) he's a business man, not a chef. And the food reflected that.",

    "text": "I wanted to absolutely love every bite of it. I had some very high expectations even. I set a reservation of 8:15 on a Sunday night. They were very specific to tell me that if I did not show up or cancelled less than 8 hours prior I would be charged $100 ($50 for every person in my party). Wow! This must mean they are so super packed and busy they cannot afford even one cancellation since that is one extra table they turned away. Hmmm, was that the case?? I showed up at 8:15 on the dizot. Hi Mr. Lovil, please have a seat while we prepare your table. Okay I said and I sat with my lovely wife, and waited and waited. It was about 8:45 when I was retrieved to sit. Funny thing was there were plenty of open tables and no one cared when I asked why it took so long. We were seated at a small two person table, okay makes sense we are a party of two. I don't care for the seating arrangement however that places you directly next to another couple trying to have a nice night out. Regardless let's start the service, after poring over the wine list I chose a nice white, eh, or not so nice. The bottle was open, it would have been nice to have a sip of the Francois Pinon but they just poured it. I can however vouche for the wine pourer since I could over hear her speaking to her many friends working at the bar and those friends who were seated at the bar. Apparently she was having a bad day and took it out on the patrons. Sorry to hear about your school issues by the way, hope you get them resolved, sorry to have eavesdropped, it was the 30 minute wait, I needed entertainment. Bread took forever to arrive, it was okay, not great but just bread, what do you expect. We got the Spanish Chorizo Quesadilla which we loved. It was interesting and different and very flavorful, I'd say get it. Also got the pork tenderloin and hacked chicken, again we thought they were excellent. The tamale that comes with the pork is excellent, the tomatillo tamale on the chicken was only so so. We ordered way too much in terms of getting 2 sides with our meal, the corn and the spinach. The corn is phenomenal, if you even remotely like corn you need to get this, it is excellent. The sauteed spinach not so much. They did not season it even slightly, not sure why. Due to this we could not fathom getting dessert and skipped it however it sounded good. Overall the food tasted very good, the service was slow and very disappointing for the amount of money being spent. I don't think I need to go back which I find disappointing.",

    "text": "Being a fan of apparently the disliked Bobby Flay, I was really looking forward to trying his creations at Mesa Grill. Being a chef who has really influenced my own cooking style, I guess I had very high expectations. I tried the mushroom quesadilla appetizer and ordered the NY strip steak with Mesa Grill steak Sauce. the appetizer was different, not what you would expect in a typical quesadilla, it was with hummus and drizzled with truffle oil, above average for sure. Now I will give the benefit that Bobby Flay isn't back there grilling my steak, but I have to say it was a bit overcooked for my liking. I ordered my steak medium-rare, and it came a borderling medium-well. As there was a packed restaurant, I figured the steak was still tender, lets just try it. Flavors were great, and the sauce was amazing, all things that Chef Flay is known for, but again just wish it had been a little less cooked. Overall, I was not disappointed and will be happy to stop by when in town again.",

    "text": "Mesa Grill was OUTSTANDING! I was in Vegas for work, met up with a colleage and we decided to check it out. I knew it was Bobby Flay's restaurant, so I was anxious to try it (I'm OBSESSED with the Food Network.) We started off with an interesting, but tasty bottle of Rioja. I believe it's a Spanish wine. Kind of a peppery taste. Our eyes bigger than our stomaches, we decided to start with the Rough Cut Tuna 'Nachos.' They came out and were almost to pretty to eat. They had the muli-colored corn chips that were cut in perfect circles. Then a nice, rare piece of tuna that was nicely chopped to drizzle the chips. Followed with mango and hot sauce on top. Delicious! The service was great! Our waitress would fill our glasses just as they got a little low. Very friendly and attentive! She even made several great entree suggestions. Everything looked so great, but I guess I was just in the mood for more tuna. I ordered the Mango and Spice Crusted Tuna Steak. I ordered mine rare. It tasted as though it was infused with cinnammon and was absolutely the best tuna steak I have ever had! Then they gave me a side of toasted pine nut cous cous. It had a nice coating of crisp, and cooked to perfection. My colleague ordered the Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin. I took a bite, not being a big pork fan and was hooked. It just melted in my mouth. We were so full, our plates still had more food and we thought this was the best meal ever and never wanted to stop.  Hahah it was a very good choice. Mia even left with a new cookbook. :)",

    "text": "Like many Las Vegas restaurants whose homes are inside the luxury hotels along the strip, Mesa Grill has an impressive space decked out in top-of-the line furniture and decor complete with a seating lounge area and full bar. Our group of 8 made a reservation here for brunch on a Saturday. We waited around 10 minutes in the lounge before getting seated. The menu for brunch had great variety ranging from your typical breakfast items with eggs, to lunch items like hamburger and dinner-like items like salmon and roasted chicken but of course each choice is riddled with Bobby Flay flair. I'm not a big fan of tex mex, so I opted for the Hamburger. LIke my review, this burger was A-OK. I didn't favor the ciabatta bread and there really wasn't anything too special about the meat or fixings. The fries on the other hand was a nice change. It had a chipotle dusting over it and what impressed me most was the horseradish mustard. I've never had anything quite like it before. Other than the food and decor, our service was top-notch. Out main waiter was very knowledgeable about the food and always there to bring us everything we needed. The busboys were attentive with the drinks/water and clearing out the food. I probably wouldn't go here again just because I was not that impressed with the food but it was more due to my own taste. I'd recommend it for others to try though.",

But the thing that really amazed me was just a little side dish -- roasted tomato. It was warm, creamy, sweet, spicy -- just amazing. Best single thing I've tasted all year.",

    "text": "Oh this place kills me. I wanted to dislike it. I was felt myself being overly critical from the second I sat down with my party of 5. I have always been somewhat annoyed by Bobby Flay, for a variety of reasons. Mesa Grill overcame my issues with their no-show celebrity chef.  I had the charred, bone-in, ribeye with a sweet and spicy chipotle glaze with the green chili queso smothered mashed potatoes. The potatoes were very good and cheesy with just the right chili bite. That was fine. Let's get to the main event. The ribeye was almost confrontational in its size and presentation. Everything about the prep and presentation was..., aggressive: aggressively cooked over a very hot charcoal grill, intensely spiced and plated with very little else on the place other than a little bit sauce and garnish. Let me tell you, it works. When you have a prime piece of beef like that, perfectly cooked, I don't know what more you should do to spruce it up. I made the comment, \"I could see Elvis eating this.\" All of the other members of my party were very happy with their meals. The chorizo tamale was a little dry but it was still well executed. The atmosphere is an extremely modern, Southwest vibe. I thought the \"lobby\" looked a little like something out of Barbarella. But I did like that movie... The service was good. It is a little spendy but the quality of the ingredients and presentation more than met my value expectations.",

Went here to meet out of town guests who were staying at Caesar's, 18-20 year old hostess did not greet us, when we stated we were here to meet guests, she told us to look around by ourselves to see if they were here - poor first contact with guest and what is supposed to be a higher-end restaurant.  Found our guests ourselves and joined them at the table.  Tables were very crowded together and wait staff and other guests continually bumped into our chairs - very annoying.  Design of restaurant was interesting - with glass wall facing the casino floor - casino noise did not infiltrate restaurant.  Had drinks and food at their Sunday brunch - I had an eggs benedict type item, with a blue corn base and crab - lukewarm in temperature and unremarkable in taste/texture.  Food of other guests was equally unremarkable.  As this was Sunday brunch, we sat at around noon and visited with our guest until about 1:30-2:00pm (not unreasonable in my opinion for brunch) - they were clearly shutting down for brunch service and setting up for dinner service, we wound up finished out meal while they were turning the restaurant over for dinner.  Little regard for remaining guests - noise and activity was very disruptive to our brunch.  Brunch for 4 with drinks was around $225.  Very unremarkable, poor service, poor layout, mediocre food - had much higher (and reasonable) expectations for Mesa Grill.",

First of all, why does a master chef like yourself need to use so much damn salt?  It's cheating.  Salt does help bring out the flavor, but using too much of it is like how people use too much MSG on Chinese food and end  up making it all taste the same.  I had the egg on a tortilla thing.  I don't even recall what it was called.  It was pretty darn salty, but edible.  The flavors weren't all that interesting.  Edible.  That's the best word to describe it.  My wife,  however, had the cobb salad.  The was so salty,  it was inedible.  So, she sent it back.  Asked them \"light salt\".  So, what did they do?  The still dusted the greens with salt.  Who puts salt on greens???  Thank God I never bought any of his cookbooks.  Apparently, the secret ingredient is half a shaker of salt.  Oh.  Sorry.  There was one plus.  I got to sit facing the sportsbook at Cesear's which everyone knows is the best sportsbook in town and got to watch the Michigan v. MSU football game.  Go Blue!",

I felt the food deserved 4 stars but the service is what brought this review down to 3 stars.  The waiter wasn't very friendly.  He was probably hung over or hated his job.

Let me stop here and mention that when I go to a \"celebrity chef\" restaurant my expectations are a bit higher. It's not just about the food...it's about the overall experience. Fame and television programing has me pre-sold on the idea that this is going to be a very good experience. As a consumer I am not concerned that the beer delivery truck was delayed or that the kitchen didn't estimate what dishes would sell well enough that they were running out of portions by 1:00 in the afternoon. Now the food, I had the pork which was very good, cooked really well and was flavorful. My companion had a specialty burger and said it was very good as well. However, neither one of us were so enamored with the food and experience that we would go out of our way to go back.

The bottle of wine my boyfriend and I shared was moderately priced and delicious.  The goat cheese fundido was large and yummy, and was a nice change from the usual \"queso\" you can get at TexMex restaurants.  And the halibut we shared was large and spicy with really great, complex flavors.  The chopped salad was meh- small with typical ingredients and flavors.  I wouldn't get this here, get something more exotic.  The ceviche trio looked amazing, fyi.  Overall, the meal was a great success and I would go back in a heartbeat.  The odd thing were the tables around us, which prevented us from getting really good service.  The table to our right waited thirty minutes for their appetizer to be delivered, were angry, and were comped on the dish.  The table to our left were hicks (seriously) and were demanding, loud and obnoxious.  The worst part is that they were convinced they had *JIZZ* on their beer glass and were making a big scene about it.  The manager tried to explain to them that the lime on the side of the glass was dripping down and created the liquid on the glass, to which the wife said, \"no thats not lime, I'm a mother\" (wtf?) and the husband yelled, \"if you think it's lime, then lick it!\"  They were given a new beer, and the husband once again complained there was jizz on the glass.  And yes, I mean jizz.  So retarded.  I thought our server (who was their server as well) handled the situation very calmly and rationally, but it was very distracting (and funny, I'll admit, I was laughing my a** off listening to them).  With all the drama, we saw our waiter very rarely, hence the one star reduction (along with the unmemorable chopped salad).  However, in any other circumstance I'm sure he would have been better.  And the busboys made up for our server, as they refilled my flipping camel of a boyfriend's glass at least twelve times.    That couple to our left though... man, I thought LA had all the crazy people.",

    "text": "I have been passing by this restaurant evertime I go to Ceasar's Palace in Las Vegas and we usually use this hotel for accomodation. Mesa Grill is close to the food court and close to the Casino, It is one of those restaurants that have been there for a long time and really made it's mark. For some reason thou, I would always pass by Mesa Grill, look at the menu and move along. To be honest, if you just go with what the Menu says it would not wake up your taste buds, the items listed are so simple and sounds..ehhh.   But time and time again I would always wish I have tried Flay's restaurant when I get back to L.A., especially since I am an avid cooking channel watcher and self claimed foodie. This weekend, me and the wife had a quick getaway and I made it a point to get a table in Mesa Grill, with very high expectations, since I just saw him kick ass in the Kitchen Stadium and throwdowns....I AM GLAD I FINALLY WENT!  Looking at the Menu outside, I decided to start off with  some Tiger Shrimp w/ Roasted Tamale and the wife got Blue Corn Pancake, both tasted wonderful and they really set the mood for the mains. Although browsing the menu, nothing really looked exciting to me, luckily I saw some tenderloins, (the bourbon got me) and I went with it. The wife wanted some fish but all they have that night are scallops and a Cioppino, both were not her likings so she decided on a Filet Mignon, medium rare, and we got some spicy sweet potatos on the side.  Let me tell you that the first bite of the Tenderloin, Mesa Grill had me... the meat was soft, very tender, the spices are there and you can really taste them but does not overpower the meat. It was delightful. The wife's filet is holding it's own on the taste department, the rub and the mushrooms are something to behold.  Somehow the star of that meal is the spicy sweet potato, the way it was prepared is something that I have not seen nor tasted before. the potatoes are cut in a rectanglein thin sheets and piled high instead of mashed. The texture of the potato changed and the spices are unbelievable, something to taste to believe. Bobby did not dissapoint at all with this restaurant and I will continue to cheer on him on TV or up until I come back to one of his restaurant.",

    "text": "The first time I went to Mesa Grill (about three years ago) I ordered a steak that was so over-seasoned, over-cooked, and just plain awful that I vowed to never eat there again. Well, some vows are made to be broken.   Everything we ordered this time around was mighty tasty.  - The blue corn muffins were the stars of the bread basket, although they were a little crumbly.  - The goat cheese queso fundido had a subtle tartness that went well with the green and red peppers of the dish. - Cheese quesadilla. It was just a quesadilla, but it was one of the best I've had. - Rough cut tuna nachos. Fresh, delicious, and a touch of spiciness. - Crispy squash blossoms. Deep fried (think tempura) with a tangy, yummy sauce. Loved it. - New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin. It was indeed tender. And hot. I just wished it had more of that bourbon ancho chile sauce. But it was so delicious that it just re-affirmed my love for all-things-pig related (maybe I need to get a tattoo of a pig like that one Top Chef contestant).  The atmosphere of the place is casual. No need to dress up for this place. It can get loud in there so I wouldn't recommend Mesa Grill for an intimate/romantic night out.",

    "text": "Oh Mesa Grill... I love you. Bobby Flay is wonderful and the flavors that he has created at Mesa Grill are outstanding. If I were ever to be on death row, I'd have Mesa Grill for my last meal. It's ALWAYS a great meal. This is the 3rd time we've been to Mesa in Las Vegas, and it will not be our last. EVERY time we go to Vegas, we make sure we have dinner here, because it is always wonderful. We were there for New Years Eve, so it was a Prix Fix menu for $120 each with app., entree, and dessert. I love the cornbread biscuits, I actually bought the Mesa cookbook and love to make them at home any chance I get. The chef prepared three bites for us which included a surf and turf and a tartar. Wish it would've been more than a bite each! I ordered their classic Margarita, which is made so so well. They have a ton of different Margaritas on their menu, but I always get the classic as it is always good. Our appetizers were lobster tacos and another Mesa favorite, the duck pancake. The lobster tacos were a bit spicy, so I got to eat them all as the Boy doesn't do super spicy foods. The duck pancake was exquisite as always.  For entrees, the Boy ordered scallops, which I had more than one bite of. I don't like scallops, but these were good. I ordered the rabbit which came with a bone in leg and some additional meat. So so yummy. I don't like bone in food, but I made an exception. For dessert we ordered the coconut cake to go (which didn't last into the morning). We ordered it last year so we knew it was good. It is very moist and the icing is not super sweet, but it is such a great compliment to the cake. We also ordered the banana pie for dining in which was splendid. Lots of bananas and great flavor.  I cannot wait to go back and I am always looking for excuses to go back to Vegas.",

    "text": "Bobby Flay is like a Russian Doll that alternates betwixt beautiful, delicate painting on smooth wood and hideous Pollock-esque splotches on roughly carved blocks. Bobby taught me to make grilled pineapple topped with vanilla bean ice cream and drizzled with caramel sauce: plus one point. Bobby then introduced me to a burger courtesy of his Palace that artfully rivaled McDonalds'. He then uncapped another layer and surprised me with a fantastically gorgeous meal at Mesa Grill.   With a brilliant introduction to his culinary prowess, Flay served up the triumvirate of Southwestern breads: a blue and yellow sweet cornbread, a sourdough dotted with jalapeno and a third nameless but tasty glutenous indulgence.  The BBQ-ed ribs were served Kansas City style - fall off the bone tenderness and a smokey undertone was complimented by a viscous sauce dazzled with crushed peanuts.  The King Shrimp tamale proved that seafood and mesa really can combine for a dish so wonderful you'll wonder why your grandmother didn't go fishing in the Gulf (or the Bay of Boston) for fat shrimp...and why she refused to grind her own corn for a thick tamale. But most of all, this King Shrimp Tamale will force you to order a regular tamale from the side menu because they're so damn irresistible...and when you go back to your cozy nook on the East Coast, you'll bemoan the lack of True American Southwestern cuisine. And if you're headed to more southern provinces closer to the border, you're likely to cry fraud at the actually authentic dishes presented at your local digs...because Bobby twisted the tamale flavor in just the right way.  Forget the banana dessert. It looks like bananas...and have another special margarita...because without it, your meal just won't be complete.",

My man lovesthe 22 oz Bone in Chipotle Ribeye.$46.. it was massive.  it took up the whole plate, and it was tender and juicy... and he ate the whole thing!!!!  it was like man vs. food, lol.  our fave dessert: pear buttermilk upside down cake....not overly sweet, and goes perfect with teh spiced ice cream.",

Flay is known for his big and bold flavors and that is certainly what you get here. It is pretty amazing how he can put just the perfect amount of spice. Its not overwhelming, but has a little bit of a kick to it. Ive had all different kinds of dishes here and all have been good. Plus extra points for the sticky toffee pudding desert.  Plus Mesa Grill is not crazy expensive either. Well, everything in Vegas is expensive. So this is not wallet breaking expensive. Just kinda expensive. :P  Mesa Grill always lands on my list of places I recommend to others. And I recommend it to you too... whoever you are.",

When we went to Mesa, it was pretty empty when we stopped by for a late lunch but then again, it was during off-peak hours. There was only one other table of customers besides my husband and me. It was really overstaffed as there was at least twice as many service people as there were customers.   -I ordered Ancho Chile Crusted Sea scallops on salad ($22) and husband had swordfish sandwich ($16). Both of our dishes were just ok. The sea scallops were undercooked and salad under it was just ok. Swordfish steak was thin and couldn't really taste any fish with all the other flavors going on with the club.  -Our entrees were a 3* but I added 1* because the sides are the highlights: They serve a really nice selection of complimentary breads, chef gave us some butter pickles that there were totally mouth-watering. Southwestern fries that came with the swordfish club is so tasty. Fries are very crispy, not too thick and well-seasoned. Not too many places do fries to my liking. They also make excellent margaritas so that's a must.   Lunch prices are decent for the strip ranging from $15-$25 / entree.",

I had the dinner entree chili rellanos which was actually stuffed with eggplant.  Unfortunately tasteless rubbery eggplant.  They totally tried to make it right and brought out some pumpkin soup.  Miss again - tasted like they pureed a pie and added hot sauce.  Bleh!   They took both items off the bill.  Service was great and the place is pretty (thought has a lot of casino smoke).

We ordered tiger shrimp tamales as our appetizer - which was the best dish of the evening. For the main course we ordered sixteen spice chicken and ancho chili. Chicken was nice and moist but nothing spectacular; it came with mashed potatoes which is a whole other story - simply delicious. Chili was amazing - the crust and the sauce were probably the best parts of the dish.  Service in general was ok - glasses were filled with water regularly - we were checked on to see how our food was and such but.... It was my friends birthday and we asked the hostess to bring out a cake as a surprise towards the end (I was obviously going to pay for it). Guess what - nothing! Was really disappointed by such carelessness from such a big establishment especially when we went there only to celebrate someone's birthday! Not sure we'll return after our experience.",

The tenderloin has a pleasant hint of heat and avoids frying your taste-buds so you can enjoy the entree.  Another favorite of mine is the Sophie's Chop Salad, which is another great example of balance.  The salad is visually appealing and has perfect proportions of flavors and textures.

    "text": "I'm not the biggest Bobby Flay fan... not especially on American Iron Chef but I figured I would give his food a chance after my third time in Vegas this summer.  We couldn't get dinner reservations on our first night so we went there for lunch yesterday.  Service was good from the moment we stepped into the restaurant.  It's not such a fancy shmancy restaurant actually.  It's decent... but nothing that'll make you go 'wow!'.  Maybe a little dated?  I don't know.... can't put my finger on one specific thing.  We got a couple of magaritas which were ok... my white peach one was well... peachy and a little like... ummm... cough syrupy lol but I don't think that's the fault of the bartender...   For appetizers, I got the blue corn pancake with duck (probably my first time ordering duck prepared non-Chinese way) and my husband got the rough chopped raw tuna taco.  Yes we had to admit, we were impressed!  They said the tuna would be VERY spicy and while it didn't turn out to be super spicy (we are serious spicy food eating folks) it did have a very nice kick.  My duck was tasty and the combination of the flavors came together very nicely.  I'd initially intended to order the pork tenderloin sandwich but the waitress swayed me to order Flay's signature dish the cuban burger sandwich... plus it came with fries so i relented very easily :)  The husband got the spicy chicken and sweet potato hash (not spicy at all).  Well, they were good but it was kind of disappointing... sort of blah... after the two great appetizers.  Both servings were also very big... so make sure you are ready to share :)  If you like thin crispy fries like me, they have good fries here.  Not the best (Shultzy's Seattle) I've had but good.  It was a good experience.  We left happy but decided it was not a place that left us planning to come back soon.  If it was a group of people and suggested this place, we would come back but we wouldn't suggest it.  ...it is a good menu to please a large audience :)  BTW, if you can't get reservations and they offer you to walk-in and try a table at the \"lounge area\"... DON'T!  It's merely a bunch of low narrow chairs around two low tables... not a place I would have a meal!",

    "text": "I know that some people are annoyed by Bobby Flay being all over the airwaves, but now I firmly believe he can back it up with real cooking talent. (or at least menu making talent)  We ate here twice, both times during lunch and both times very different.  The first time we ate here a long while back, it was a Monday right at opening so there were only a few tables of people. And we had, by far, the BEST service I have ever experienced at a restaurant in my life.  This last time it was a Friday around 1pm and every table in the place was full, everyone and their brother wanted to be there. And our service was still very good although impossible for them to be as attentive. I think the key is that there is a waiter and an assistant, so someone is always filling your glass and available for anything you could possibly need.   Everything we have eaten here has been awesome and I recommend any of them. Blue corn pancake w/ duck and habanero, goat cheese queso fundido, spicy chicken and sweet potato hash, steak sandwich, pressed Cuban burger.   The seating is comfortable and accessible. The decor is really lovely in Southwest colors.   Lunch time is really casual and easy to get a table. Even if its busy, you are seated quickly. No need for reservations.  Although if you do wish to call ahead, please note that you will be talking to Caesars and not the restaurant itself - and Caesars requires a credit card to hold any reservations.   We like coming here so much, we have decided it is our LV ritual now. And I look forward to venturing to the NE region to try some other Bobby Flay establishments in the future.",

    "text": "I stopped in to Caesar's Palace for a quick lunch on a recent trip to LV and found Celebrity Chef Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill to be a pretty decent spot to grab a bite.  I had the spicy chicken and sweet potato hash and could only complain about the lack of crispy crustiness that usually makes hash so delightful.  As far as the flavor was concerned it was really very enjoyable.  A deft balance of sweet and savory and heat that went very nicely with the blue and yellow corn jalapeno muffin from the bread basket that comes with every meal.  The hash is appropriately plated with two perfectly poached eggs sitting on top of the hash, contributing their yolky goodness to the enterprise.  A Hornitos margarita rounded out the meal and while it might have been slightly heavy on the sweet and sour it was otherwise sufficiently slurp-worthy.  It packed the requisite punch and precipitated a boozy smile on my face as I and my arched eyebrow stumbled out into Caesar's 24-hour nonstop cabaret of madcap money-letting bacchanalia.   Res ipsa loquitor, indeed.",

So far, so good. Drinks were big and strong. The appetizers arrived and presentation and flavor were wonderful. The same could be said about the main courses. Everything that everyone in our party ordered was fantastic. The servers were helpful, friendly, and fast. I was a little worried that \"Southwestern Cusine\" might be hard to pull off, but while the flavors were bold, it was tastefully done and not overpowering at all. A great restaurant.",

The restaurant opened before chef Flay sold his soul to food TV so the food, service and overall quality is still great and a great experience to dine here. Most of my visits are spontaneous so we had to wait a while to be seated but waiting at the bar is very pleasant. The food is great I recommend the blue corn tortilla and duck or blue corn lobster taco for starters and if you like steak it's great. They have extensive collection of wine and I have enjoyed some fine and expensive bottles. Service is great and friendly. I highly recommend this restaurant.",

    "text": "A lot of people I know are either fans of Mr. Flay like myself or don't like him at all. Either way, anyone I have gone to his restaurants with have loved the food. This place is my favorite of all of them. I actually ate at the one in the Bahamas first which was a 5/5 and recently I had eaten at the one in Vegas which was almost as good so I had to balance it out with a 4. Let me start by saying the decor in this place is beautiful. I think Mr. Flay and I are cut from similar modes because I like not only his food, but his personality and tastes. The lighting is warm and ambient and I almost like everything but the flames on the walls. That's the only thing that is somewhat corny to me. Everything else I'm all about.   Lets just get right to it. The food. Outstanding. I mean really the amount of thought that goes into the dishes and how ingredients play off each other is mind blowing. I started off with the blue corn pancake with Barbecued duck. Now I have said this quite a few times but if you know me you know if you can get my tear ducts going you have something special in front of me. When I say I've never teared this much from I truly mean it. This was one of the most tasty, delicious things I have ever eaten. Cooked to absolute perfection I ate this appetizer for about 10 min. I really wanted to taste every ounce of this dish. The sauces were phenomenal.   My main course was the New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin with a sweet potato tamale and almond butter. Man, what a dish. That tamale was freaking heaven. I couldn't get enough of it. The pork was cooked so tender i could cut it with my fork. Just a great job. I don't even remember what I had for dessert I think I was too full to eat anything but man, if you are looking so splurge and really have a wonderful meal go to this place. Damn good.",

    "text": "This place is great! I mean great! I have long been a fan of Bobby Flay. Since I am a die hard Food Network fan I have had the opportunity to see a lot of Bobby. I like his style and I really like the fact that he incorporates a lot of different chiles and southwestern flavors into his food.  I came here with my wife Shelly and two of our best friends. So we decided to try several different items.  We started with the appetizer of the Barbecued Ribs that are finished in a peanut chipotle sauce. Lip smackin' good! Very flavorful and cooked perfectly. We next moved to the Blue Corn Pancake with bbq'd Duck and was finished with a habenero star anise sauce. Very good. It was small so we each got one bite but we enjoyed it nonetheless. We also enjoyed the Blue Corn Lobster Tacos. These were fantastic!! The flavors were spot on and this was my favorite appetizer. Last but not least was the Burrata and Grilled Radicchio salad. Not bad but not spectacular either.  For the entrees we ordered three of them. I ordered the Fire Roasted Veal Chop. Shelly and I split this dish. This was finished with a maple-horseradish glaze and got a \"wow\" reception from the entire table. I love veal and this did not disappoint. I ordered it medium rare and it came cooked to perfection. My buddy Dave ordered the Coffee Rubbed Filet Mignon that was finished in a mushroom-ancho chile sauce. This also received rave reviews (I had this on my previous visit) and was cooked to perfection as well. Fork tender and flavorful. Our friend Brenda ordered the Cornmeal Crusted Chile Rellano. This was stuffed with roasted eggplant, manchego cheese and then topped with a sweet red pepper sauce and balsamic vinegar. This dish was outstanding. This may have been the least enticing dish for me but was very memorable for the outstanding textures and flavors. I tend to go more toward meat dishes when I dine out but I would not hesitate to order this on my next visit. It was that good!  For the sides we had the Roasted Corn with chipotle aioli, lime and cotija cheese. Awesome!  We also had the mashed potatoes with the green chile queso sauce. This was spectacular as well.  This was my second visit to Mesa Grill and I was just as wowed as my first. If you like Bobby Flay and his take on southwestern food this place is not to be missed.  As a side note...what made this a most enjoyable experience was the company that I was with. Great friends and great food cannot be overstated.",

    "text": "I was referred to Mesa Grill by the Concierge and surprisingly enough, had never heard of Bobby Flay before this, even though I watch the Food Network (how is that possible??).    Meat was highly recommended by our waiter so I ordered the N.Y. Strip Steak with Mesa Grill House sauce for $48.  Definitely one of the most tender steaks I've eaten in my short life.  The steak was marinated and aged and once I took the first mouth-watering bite, I was glad I ordered the it.  Although it was ala carte, the steak was a good portion, around 20 oz. or so.  I would recommend this piece of meat to any steak lovers out there, but at $50 a pop, I would probably try other things first before repeating.  Sides were $8 a piece.  The spinach was okay, I could've passed on that but I needed some greens.  The garlic mashed potatoes however, were excellent.  I've had better before, but they definitely complimented my steak.  Tried the Tiger Prawns as my appy and although it was good, it was nothing to write home about.    Other favorites at the table were the Coffee Filet Mignon and the Tuna Steak.    To sum up, the food and service were excellent.  Just figure to pay a little extra for the \"Bobby Flay\" name.",

Come on, its not a baseball cap!!   ***FOOD: - They start you off with a basket of bread and this is probably the best thing in the restaurant (sad to say). The jalapeno and the blue berry bread were quite interesting and delicious.  - I ordered the shrimp tamale and it was mediocre. I've had better.  - The Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich was not the best. The bread was quite hard so I couldn't enjoy the sandwich. - The flavor of the Spicy Chicken Sweet Potato Hash was pretty over-bearing in flavor.  - The chicken salad was blah. The chicken was dry and nothing was great about it.  Overall, mesa grill you have disappointed me and you will definitely not see me again.

The front of house seemed bummed to see us arrive, the welcome wasn't warm,  It was a Saturday morning at 11 am, and I expect people to put on a good face for customers approaching.  Our waiter was excellent and helpful though, and the service overall was very good.   I ordered the quesadila with fried cotija cheese filled with crispy bacon and hash browns, topped with a fried egg. It was cooked poorly with one half cooked to an embarrassing crisp that turned into dust when it met my firm fork hand, and the other half plainly under cooked. The bacon was chewy, which doesn't work in this dish, although it was tasty it was clearly undercooked. The topping of a fresh salsa was over-seasoned with salt and tasted like a tomato salt-sa (okay, sorry about that pun)  I also had the roasted corn chowder, which was nice and sweet. A pretty nice brunch offering.  The bread basket was very good, with the jalapeno muffin being the star.   I've had the burger here, and have raved about it after trying it once at the bar-- but on this occasion the muenster cheese had melted into no where land. And, when I sliced into it I could see it wasn't cooked evenly.  When that happens it breaks apart and is a big mess. It was a disappointing  end to my meal.  I won't be back. I wish I had come for dinner, it seems to be more of the chef's game, and it appears the kitchen staff's all-stars work that shift, based on the reviews here.    Not recommended for Brunch.",

The dish was super tender and moist. The sauce with it had just the amount of spice and heat to not overtake the pork. Our desserts were the chocolate pudding and a chocolate cake.

    "text": "Bobby Flay did not disappoint. Mesa Grill exceeded my expectations. The atmosphere is vibrant and colorful...there's a beautiful bar up front and the dining area beyond that. Our server Paul and the other gentleman working with him serving and clearing were extremely attentive and engaging. I was expecting typical Mexican fare and boy, was I wrong. This was upscale dining with big Southwest flavor. My husband and I started out with a couple of margaritas, traditional for him and white peach for me.  The bread service was delicious, a wonderful variety of freshly baked bread. My husband and I share the shishito peppers, charred nicely with a pomegranate salt.  My husband ordered the Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin with sweet potato tamale. The pork was perfectly cooked pink in the middle, full of bold flavor and a generous portion. I had the mango and spice crusted tuna steak with couscous. The tuna steak was huge, so fresh and tender, seared to rare in the middle.  The food at Mesa is absolutely fantastic! I highly recommend making reservations, I highly recommend this dining experience. The only disappointment of the evening was that I didn't see Bobby himself... LOL",

    "text": "Overall: great sauces, good restaurant week deal, amazing cornbread muffins  I've been to MESA grill a few times, both in NYC and Vegas. First thing, everything has a little kick to it, so if you're a wimp to spice, you'll have a hard time here. I am not a huge spicy food fan but I could tolerate it because the food is so good otherwise.  We were here for restaurant week and the lunch was a great deal, 3 decently large courses for $30. And the bread to start. The bread is amazing, they give 3 types, 2 sliced breads and then the blue and yellow cornbread muffins which are crumbly and soft yet perfectly moist. We asked for more muffins because we loved it so much!   We got the tiger shrimp tamale as an appetizer and it was excellent. The size wasn't overwhelming but there was a decent amount of shrimp. The sauce was also very flavorful and we ended up eating the remaining sauce with the complementary bread!   As entrees, we had the smoked salmon sandwich and the jumbo lump crab cake. The smoked salmon isn't regular smoked salmon, its more cooked salmon with a very smokey taste, not the almost raw kind you eat with cream cheese. This threw us off a little bit but it was still very good. By itself, the smokey flavor was almost too much, but when paired with the bacon and avocado in the sandwich the flavors all went really nicely together. The crab cake was nice too, I didn't eat a lot of it because it was quite spicy, but the avocado sauce and aioli that came with it complemented it well and cut some of the heat.  For dessert there was a coconut cake slice. The cake was perfectly moist, there was a nice small layer of frosting that was airy and light, and of course another sauce on top! Bobby Flay does a great job with sauces, and even brought them to dessert. Although I'm not a big coconut person, I did really enjoy this cake.",

I also happen to come with a rather full belly, so not really looking forward to eating.  But what I had (the roasted avocado) was delicious.  It's a small serving (I was warned) but it was delicious.  I might come back when I'm not full, nor rushing to head to another event.

We got there probably about 7pm, on a Saturday, and there were a decent amount of tables available so I'm a little confused. Aside from that everything was pretty good. I went to Mesa Grill in NY years ago, didn't think it was that great. But chef Flay has this Vegas location on point. We started with a couple cocktails: I had a cherry cola old fashioned and the wife had a white peach margarita (pricey in real life $15-16 a pop). Food: wife got the shrimp app as her meal ($20), very good flavors, goes well w the sauce and corn tamale. I got the ribeye w the glaze ($65). I don't know if I was hungry or what, but it was a great steak. Got the cauliflower for a side, I don't really eat that but they had so much cheese on it, it tasted like au gratin potatoes. Good spot!!! Maybe be back one day.",

The atmosphere is open and fun, yet sophisticated. The bread is amazing! The cornbread muffin is very interesting on the tastebuds which leaved us wanting more so we asked for another basket, which came out right away. I got the sixteen spice chicken! The garlic mango sauce was fantastic, along with the mash potatoes. The portion was a great size compared to some places that think it's cool to give you dime sized portions lol came with two pieces of chicken! So filling!! My boyfriend got the swordfish which he thought was delicious. One thing he said was there should be a bit more risotto, he can eat a lot and fast! The service was amazing. The guy bringing water, bread and cleaning up plates was soooo professional and a hard worker! He's the best!! I'll be telling all my friends about this place! Thanks Mesa Grill!",

    "text": "After not having been to Vegas in a few years, we booked a last minute trip due to a free hotel stay at the Venetian.  One of the things I wanted to try was the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Palace.  I put together a plan and even gave ourselves about 2-3 hours extra to get there on time.  Well, the buffet Gods were not smiling down on me this day.  I ran into traffic.  A LOT of traffic.  While I did drive like it was a Cannonball Run race, to make up for lost time, I got there a little late.  Because I always have a plan B when we travel (heck, I even put spreadsheets together), Tacos El Gordo was our back up.    Ok, I know I already mentioned Bacchanal and Tacos El Gordo already.  And you're probably wondering what business you clicked on.  Well, don't worry.  It's coming.    It was late, so me and the wife decided to go check into our hotel, get the kids washed up and into bed, while I was going to pick up those tacos.  However, we did have to get the kids something to eat.  So, since Mesa Grill was open, and it was on my Yelp bookmarks to try, we went in.  See, I told you it was coming.   Anyway, we didn't want to eat too much since we were getting tacos.  We went with quesadillas for the kids and a light snack for us:  Blue Corn Pancake with Roasted Duck and a Corn Tamale with Garlic Tiger Shrimp.  The pancake with duck was great.  The barbecued duck was tender and the 2 sauces, habanero chile and star anise, complimented the flavors perfectly.  As good as that dish was, the tamale was even better.  However, I'm probably a little biased here as I'm a lover of cilantro.  Served with the tamale and garlic shrimp was a scrumptious cilantro cream sauce.  If you've ever been to Luche Libre in San Diego (another restaurant, Jamie?  Stick to one!), then it is very comparable, if not better.  While my doctor probably wouldn't like me to, I would drink that stuff if I could.   All-in-all, a great place to get a snack, but I'm sure it's even better for an actual dinner.  Be aware, this is still Vegas, so the dishes are a little pricey for what it is.  The appetizers were about $20 still.  Service was ok, but it seems they switched off or something because 3 different people came to our table.",

You get a too generous portion of pork tenderloin. A serving of protein is a deck of cards right? You get about 3. Not complaining- it was super tender (tenderloin lol), juicy, hints of bourbon and spice. The tamale was good as well. Sweet, almost like a dessert. A good balance with the protein and a very filling dish. I wish I had the stomach to order dessert but this dish had me very stuffed.   PS I hear Bobby Flay makes appearances so that's cool!",

Its a Bobby Flay Tex Mex restaurant located in Caesars Palace across from the sports book.  It's a fancy kind of place where you have multiple waiters assigned to different tasks.  We get sat at our table and the waiter takes our drink orders.  He sells me on the Patrida margarita, a margarita mixed with organic agave.  It was served in martini glass neat.  It was excellent.  The hidden agave flavor was subtle but made the drink.  The waiter brought us over a little basket of bread.  It had a couple of these little cornmeal muffins that were delicious.  Couple slices of Parmesan infused bread and some other fresh baked breads.  For our appetizer, we ordered the goat cheese fundido.  It came in a small cast iron serving dish with a bed of blue corn tortilla chips.  It was a nice mix of cheeses with a crunchy/chewy crust in the corners.  A nice little appetizer.  For my main course, I ordered the 22 ounce ribeye medium rare with a side of brussel sprouts.    The steak was cooked perfectly, very tender, and had a delicious almost sweet crust.  It came with a green and a red sauce to compliment the steak.  I enjoyed the green and opted for an extra portion.  The brussel sprouts were decent.  Overall, a nice fine dining experience.  A little pricey but worth it.",

    "text": "After waving goodbye to my BF at Caesar's poker room at noon, I decided to treat myself and have lunch at Mesa Grill.  I sat at the bar and was greeted by a very friendly bartender.  After a horrible meal at Red, White & Blue in the Mandalay Bay the day before, I was hoping for something better and was in the mood for a burger.  There were two on Mesa Grill's menu, a standard one and one that was a cuban style burger.  I asked the bartender which was better.  He said he thought both are good but suggested I try the cuban style one for a change of pace.  The burger came on a rectangular glass plate with a side of fries and an aioli.  I liked how the bun was toasted and firm, not soggy.  The beef was very juicy and cooked medium rare.  There was ham in burger.  While it was tasty, I could have done without it, as I think meat upon meat is a bit much.  The fries were crisp and well-seasoned.  For $16 it's not a bargain but after tasting the horrible, but same priced burger at Red, White & Blue, I thought the one at Mesa Grill was worth it.  The only thing I thought was a bit pricey was my lemonade, which was $4.  It was good, but not $4 good.  Nevertheless, I'll definitely go back to Mesa Grill try the other items on the menu.",

Of all our dishes though, I highly recommend the Tiger Shrimp Blue Corn Tamale for appetizer and Grilled Mahi Mahi. The creaminess of the tamale and the sweet/ sour/ slightly spicy pineapple sauce drizzled on the fish will definitely send you to heaven! One disappointment was our drinks. 2 of us ordered \"Gimme a Lemonade\" (green tea vodka + lemonade). It was very bitter and we could not taste any sour-ness of lemonade. It tasted like water down vodka. But maybe it's supposed to be this way? I give Mesa Grill 4 out of 5 because it didn't impress us with as much punch as some other places we tried in the next few days.",

    "text": "I came here after hearing so much about the Ancho Chile flavoring that Bobby Flay uses in many dishes.  We had made a reservation for a party of 3, and were seated promptly once all of us arrived.  It was on a Friday night, during a big convention week, so I was pretty impressed by that.  The decor was very modern and cool.  The food was equally impressive.  The presentation of the food was beautiful as well.  I'm sold on this place!  The one really cool touch I thought they had were the use of agua-fresca jugs in various color patterns on the wall.  First I thought they looked really familiar, and then when I realized that they are the jugs where yummy Horchata comes from, I had laughed out loud to myself.  Onto the food...  For appetizers, we ordered the following:  blue corn pancake barbecued duck + habanero chile-star anise sauce - $15:  I remember this tasting more like really tender pork than duck, and I even had to confirm this with the server.  Strangely, this was not a bad thing.  I was very intrigued by this dish.  We all really enjoyed the slight peking-duck-like flavoring on the sauce.  tiger shrimp + roasted garlic corn tamale corn-cilantro sauce- $16: These shrimps tasted like shrimps. :)  With a more intense flavor than I can remember any shrimp that I've had.  The corn was very tasty as well.  For my entree, I wanted to try the pork tenderloin that everyone's raved about so much here, and all 3 of us ended up doing the same:  new mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin bourbon-ancho chile sauce sweet potato tamale + crushed pecan butter - $36: This dish was amazing.  It had a strong spicy kick, but not overwhelming and lighting my tongue on fire.  The meat itself was tender and delicious.  AND, there was more food on the plate than I could finish.  Since it was sooo good, I had to pretty much force down the rest, just so that I can continue to enjoy the flavoring and tenderness.    I am a fan of Bobby Flay.  I'll have to try his other menu items and locations for sure!",

We were a bit early for our reservation, so we grabbed a seat at the bar to wait.  The decor is awesome, and definitley captures the essence of the restaurant.  Everything is decked out in yellow, blue, red and green and has a very southwestern flair. I started off with the Cactus Pear Margarita, which had a nice zing and wasn't too sweet.   We were starving and very excited to eat.  The complimentary breads and butter were good, but I didn't indulge because I wanted to save room for the real food.  Thanks to our waiters (and yelpers) recommendations, we started off with the garlic shrimp tamale...I swear it kept getting better with each bite.  I normally don't like tamales (not a big corn fan) but this was AMAZING.  I probably could have had it as my meal, it was so filling.  I was pleasantly surprised to find they didn't skimp on the shrimp, and the sauce was so wonderful, I drenched each and every bite of my tamale in it.  We also had the black bean and chicken quesadilla.  It was great, with lots of chicken and guacamole and cooked perfectly...not too soggy and not too crisp.    At this point we were already full, but we weren't about to pass up an entree so we decided to share the pork tenderloins and the pesto mashed potatoes.  OH MY GOD...the pork was tender and juicy, and the cut was just perfect.  The sauce complimented it well, a mixture of sweet and spicy.  And the pesto mashed potatoes?  Well, let's just say...WHY DIDN\"T I THINK OF THAT!!  They were creamy and flavorful, and although we thought we were about to burst, we ate every last bite.  Too bad we didn't save room for dessert, but we will be back!!!!",

It's pretty rich, and I didn't even finish it.   The portions are pretty generous and his sauces are amazing. Everything has just the amount of fire to it! I ordered the pork with the sweet potato tamale. Everyone really enjoyed their meals and we were stuffed to our max capacity!   Cute bartender and really friendly staff.

I personally could not be categorized as a foodie, but I wasn't too stoked about the fact that it was served room temperature. As a toasted hot sandwich aficionado, my sandwich was simply \"a-ok\" as Yelp would call it.  The sandwich was a little cold for a hungry hungover maiden.    The bread and my fries however were amazing. The jalapeno poppers were my favorite in the plethora of carbs.  There was cornbread and cranberry bread as well.   I sampled my friends burgers and they were DIVINE. I should have skipped on the room temp. pork and indulged in the massive beef goodness.   I would have really given this place a 4, but I paid $5 for my hot green tea which was nothing spectacular and my sandwich could have been a little bit better. Too bad I can't give .5 stars. Cuz this place would then be 3.5. (Due to my experience with  that meal).   The deco was fantastic and is in a very good location. Great service all around and next time I go back, I'll try something a littler hotter for my tastes.",

I hear complaints from people on Yelp about quantity and price here.  It is Bobby Flay!  I fully expect small portions, high prices but also quality.  I was happy with the quality of the food we got I was happy with the service as well.  As Bobby, we are on a first name basis now, is known for grilling I will have to come back and try a steak as I had brunch.

    "text": "We've been dining at Mesa Grill since it first opened over 10 years ago. And I'm happy to say that it's just as good every time we go. The only thing that I think this restaurant is missing is some updated dishes. I think after 13 years it's nice to see some new options on the menu.   The best items are on the menu are the appetizers and  think the entrees could do with a bit of an update. I was happy to see that the restaurant was busy, because on my last couple visits it was on the slower side. The major downfall of this restaurant is that the servers, managers hostesses and others don't seem like they enjoy working there.  One of the best things about going out to eat is creating an environment that makes people want to come back. I enjoy servers who aren't too intrusive but yet fun to be around. I also felt like the greeting at the front desk left a lot to be desired, her main concern was that everybody in the party was present rather than greeting us and welcoming us to the restaurant. It really sets the tone for the evening the way you were greeted at the door. I kind of felt like I walked into Denny's. No offense to Denny's.   When we sat down we waited quite a while to be greeted and after our drinks were ordered it took quite a while for the bread basket to be delivered. I just felt like it was difficult to get anybody's attention and that there was a pervasive feeling of apathy throughout the entire staff. Sometimes when a restaurant stays open for a long time people get complacent and forget that you're being welcomed into a new environment and you're paying a lot of money. It's around $100 per person in this restaurant that's definitely not a cheap evening. And I expect everybody around me to be on their toes with a smile on their face, ready to  fulfill any requests. I was wearing a black velvet dress and asked for a black napkin since they were only white ones on the table. I had to ask three times and noticed that there were several black napkins sitting at a busing station nearby.   I also was disappointed with the signature cocktail which was a pomegranate martini. I think Bobby Flay has a great flair for cocktails and unfortunately this cocktail did not represent anything that I think he would be proud of. It just tasted like a glass full of vodka there was no flavor there was no subtlety it was just all alcohol.  Many people in our party ordered the steak and everybody felt the steaks were top quality and very delicious. But at the end of the day it's just a steak I think it would be nice if they updated the side or did something a little bit more creative that reflected Bobby's complex flair for seasoning and ingredients. There's really no Southwest influence in any of the main dishes. So I'm not really sure why the menu was developed with the appetizers representing the theme of the restaurant where the entrees are definitely standard fare. You could have a twice baked potato and pesto mashed potatoes anywhere with the steak. In fact you could probably make it at home pretty easily. I had the salmon with a honey glaze it was perfectly done and delicious but as somebody who dined out very frequently it really was not a memorable dish in anyway. I always come back to this restaurant whenever we visit Vegas a couple times a year, but I think it needs to be reinvigorated both in the service department and a little freshening up with a menu.",

My aunt and uncle were in town, and they are the ones that really exposed me to the finer things in life at a very early age. They took my to musicals, we dined at some of the best restaurants in the bay area (both on the high end and mom/pop end). My appreciation for food is rooted in those experiences. When they visit Las Vegas, we usually take them to a local's spot, and they take us to a Strip spot. Their last visit led us here. I wouldn't normally consider eating at Mesa Grill unless it was Las Vegas Restaurant week, but I'm glad I got to experience it with them. The Southwestern flavors really shine through all their entrees, but I was probably most impressed with the corn bread. The restaurant itself is spacious and you feel removed from the hustle and bustle of the casino just outside. Service is outstanding, as to be expected. I say if you're a local, eat here at least once, and if you're a tourist, consider this a place to head to for dinner before your wild Vegas night.",

The food is pricey but you're in Vegas and in Bobby Flay's territory. The blue corn duck appetizer was tiny and okay. The duck seemed a bit dry but the sauce was good. My lamb entree was AHMAAZINGGG. Super tender- they recommended medium which I got. Two of my friends got the filet and I got 2 completely different reactions. One exclaimed it was the greatest steak of their life (they got it rare) and the other said they wish they had gotten something else (they got it med-rare). Not sure what to make of that. if you're the kind of person that likes your steak super juicy w/ sauce on top, don't get it! If you like dry rubs, this is for you. My friend said the mesa margarita was one of the best drinks he's had- made sure to get 2. I got the pomegranate martini that was so strong it took me the entire night to finish it. Bang for the buck!   We got the cookies for dessert and it was probably the most disappointing part of the meal so I really wish I had gotten something different. Not disgusting or anything but just alright.   Overall it was YUMMY. Brussel sprouts and sweet potato for sides were great. The service was incredible- truly above and beyond.",

As in the past, I ordered the Goat Cheese Queso Fundido.  It continues to be a great appetizer to start off your meal.  Melting cheese served with blue corn tortilla chips can't be beat.  Definitely one of my favorite things to order.  Besides the appetizer, Mesa Grill provides you with a bowl of tasty breads to munch on while waiting for your food.  On this visit, I had the Spicy Scrambled Eggs for my main entree.  It was ok, but not as good as other entrees that I've had at Mesa Grill.  The entree lacked the excitement that I've come to enjoy at Mesa Grill.    The other thing that caused a downer for me on this meal was that they sat us at the 2 person table that is inches from other tables.  I really hate when restaurants do that.  Not because I mind sitting by people, but it makes it hard to have a conversation when you can clearly hear everyone else right next to you.  I'll come back to Mesa Grill again, but I'll definitely make some new choices on what I eat.",

    "text": "As this was our 3rd signature restaurant, I felt we were in a good position to assess how much the restaurant reflects the celebrity chef's point of view and personal style.  Admittedly, Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill, located in the very heart of the Caesar's Palace casino is a virtual retreat from the chaos of the environment just steps outside the door.   With a cool Southwestern decor, we were seated and provided with enthusiastic, if not somewhat pushy service.  Our waiter strongly suggested a margarita as they are the house specialty, which we passed on, honestly due to the exorbitant price point.  The open kitchen provides nice entertainment and the ability to see your dinner being prepared with care is a welcome touch.  For us, we order one entree, three appetizers and two sides.  Everything served was declious, but small in portion.  I would say the secret is in the sauce, as every sauce was worth practically licking the plate.  My pescetarian daughter forewent her devotion and love of the sea to try the barbecue duck in a blue corn tortilla and never looked back.  She could only say, \"Yum!\"  The tiger shrimp appetizer was equally enjoyed for its taste and aesthetic presentaition.  Our other daughter delightfully received a beautiful side of sweet potato gratin, which was served in a small skillet, crisp on the top; both sweet and spicy.  Her lobster tacos were literally the size of three fingers, but incredibly flavorful with a hint of citrus and overall lobster goodness.  Splitting the salmon, which the watier said should be served medium was delicious but a bit rare for me.  He went on to ask about our choice of side, when sides are actually ala carte.  We chose the sauteed spinach, which was fine.  All in all, Bobby Flay should be pleased with the chefs cooking the entrees, as they seemed to devote a great deal of care and Flay style by occasionally dousing the food with a ring of water and/or oil, only to cover it with a metal top to \"steam\" the particular entree dish.  We enjoyed our dinner and agreed that the flavor and ambience were memorable, but wished for a bit more satisfying portion in line with the price point.",

The flavors were fantastic and the salmon was set on a sauce that had a mole flavor! So delicious. I was very impressed with the little bread basket too! Bread is bread. But theirs is filled with these corn muffins and jalapeno biscuits that are amazing. As much as I loved the food, I decided to give them a 4 star simply due to our server. The food came quick and he was attentive. However, he was really pushing us to order alcohol. It was still early and we were seeing a show on top of an early flight the next morning so I didn't plan on drinking and simply ordered water with lemon. He gave me a strange eye roll and at one point looked over at us, put his head in his hand and shook his head while complaining to another server. I'm not sure if he was complaining about us but I saw him look over right at our table. The food is expensive enough, we didn't need alcohol for him to get a good tip, which he did! So that was strange.... The food is a little overpriced for what it is but it's Vegas. However, I love Bobby Flay, the food was exactly what I would've expected from him and I will definitely go again!",

This was a must-stop for me, just reading the menu offered...and I am happy to say that the food exceeded my high expectations!  Starting off with the complimentary bread basket...the corn muffin was very good!  The others were also tasty and eaten up by Little Foodie!  For app, the Tiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale ($18): Corn and Cilantro Sauce. This was highly recommended for good reason...This was perfect lol!  Very large, sweet and tender shrimps, very fluffy, tasty corn tamale with a mouthwatering cilantro sauce! Noms :D  Of course, I went with the Burger for entree!  Green Chile Burger ($16): Queso Sauce, Roasted Poblanos, Pickled Red Onions and Southwestern Fries. VERY good burger...juicy, and packed with flavor from the roasted peppers and onions. The fries were great, with a slightly salty spicy taste. Worth it!  One of the better priced options on the strip that packs a punch!  To finish, Caramel Chocolate Pudding ($11): Malted Whipped Cream. This was good but not amazing...wish it would have finished the meal off strong! The candy bar bits on top were nice to mix together though.  Service was great, prices were fair but a steal for RW menu!  I did have to put down a credit card for my reservation via Opentable for the first time though...not a big deal to me, just keep it in mind.    Put it on your to-do list :P  Pics!  :",

If you don't have tons of money, not the best place for your wallet, but you shouldn't even be reading this review if that is the case. But this is a nice special occasion joint but not too special if ya know what I mean. I believe it was 28-35 a plate. The breads that they serve were incredible. I'd recommend second helpings or even thirdsies.",

I ordered the Spicy Chicken with Sweet Potato Hash and my wife ordered the Smoked Shrimp Tacos. My spicy chicken was super delicious and the cuts of chicken were tender too.  What i enjoyed most about the meal is how flavorful, light and filling it is; but not heavy.  My wife hit a home run with the Smoked Shrimp tacos, I actually preferred it over my meal, I loved the smoked flavor of the shrimp, and it tasted superbly excellent.  For dessert we had the banana pudding which is a nice light dessert to end your dining experience.   The service was excellent and attentive which I would have expected at an upscale restaurant like this.   One of the best meals I have had in a long-time you will not be disappointed.",

Crab cake has good flavor and lumps of crab but cost $24. Tamales tasted like dessert. Skip the churros. The ones at Costco are much better and won't put a hole in your pocketbook. The two star was the poor service. We had to ask for bread 4 times. Our waiter definitely paid more attention to the table next us, engaging in long conversation when we told him we had a Celine Dion show to catch. Will not be back. Left feeling cheated.",

I have been to MG many times and have never been disappointed until my most recent visit. Ordered the Mesa Burger and it was way, waaaaay to salty. I came back the next day for brunch and had the delicious Ranch Style EggsTostada with grits (amazing), the lady sitting next to me at the bar ordered the MG Burger and she complained to the barman that the burger was to salty, informed them I had the same issue the previous day !  That's really the only reason I'm not giving MG a ***** rating, hoping to bring to the attention of current chef & BF the salt issue. Lots of choices in Vegas, but would still highly recommend MG, and will be a repeat diner as long as I don't have the same issue again !",

I expected that Donna would see if the chef would offer an alternative.  Instead we were unceremoniously handed our check.   No offer of the dessert menu.  No offer of coffee or an after dinner drink.  More like Don't want the pudding, get out.      While I won't say this ruined the meal it certainly left us disappointed.",

Brussels sprouts were in syrup, would have much preferred a crisper sautee with bacon. Also didn't finish those.  Blue corn duck pancake was tasty. Spicy pork was also quite tasty.

The shrimp was cooked perfectly, which is a rarity. I don't know what else to say.  Second we got the Pancake with duck, which also comes so highly recommended. It too was delicious, we ranked it second behind the Tamale, but was still amazing.   Third, we got the stuffed squash blossoms. Really good, not something I would normally order, and indeed it ranked 3rd of the three.  Overall, the food we enjoyed was incredible... but $60 for 3 small appetizers, we probably would not go back just due to budgetary constraints.",

We have been here several years ago and had a great experience.  My wife ordered a salad, and asks for a different dressing. The waiter responded by saying \"Bobby Flay is known for not substituting anything\".  My wife responded by saying, \"I understand, but I am lactose intolerant. If you can't substitute, I can't eat the salad\". The waiter said he would ask the chef.  The waiter asked only 1 person at the table what she wanted to drink and brought the rest of us water. Also, we had to ask for the corn muffins after being seated for more than 10 minutes and not receiving them.   In this day and age, we are applied because there are lots of very good restaurants around. That's the main reason that customer service can be used to set a place apart from the rest.

This place is not for the simple eaters.  If you aren't keen on trying something \"different\" or fusion of flavors or consider yourself fairly picky, then I would NOT eat here.   I loved this place but some of my friends had a hard time with the menu as they don't appreciate good \"different\" food. If you're one of those then you're better off eating somewhere else!  I had the corn shrimp tamale for appetizer drizzled with cilantro sauce (HIT THE SPOT.) IT was the BEST tamale I have ever had. My lunch was really good too but Id prob wouldn't order it again. I had the shrimp tacos, but I just ate them right off the skewers instead of wrapping them up in a blando tortilla (However, it did look home-made).  The home made salsas were an added bonus--wish I had some chips with that.  NOt sure why but my DIET pepsi (THANKS BOBBY FOR PEPSI products NOT COKE!!) was really good too--they must change the oxy tanks daily b/c it was the freshest pepsi i had in Vegas..i know..so random.  Overall, I would definitely come here again and try other things. It is a bit pricey but I think its worth it b/c everything is SO fresh and cooked to perfection. Also, the service was outstanding. My sister told the waiter she couldnt eat dairy and he made sure to consult with the cook about her order. Couldn't have asked for a better lunch. Bobby ROCKs.",

Also really enjoy the unique bread selection with brunch, which includes items like mini coffee cakes and mini scones (all with slightly southwestern flavors).    Having been to Mesa Grill in NYC several times as well, this location does not offer quite the same level of food (as one would expect).  Service at the NYC location also tends to be a bit more professional, although the service that I've received in LV has always been exceptionally friendly and attentive so no complaints.",

    "text": "One Star for the service....We didn't dine here.... Read on:   We decided to go to Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill to celebrate my wife's birthday. I've dined and lunched there many times with excellent experiences with both dining and service....except this time.   Using the contact number on the MG website, I called to make reservations for a Wednesday dinner. Once connected, the operator connects me to the restaurant and I request to make reservations for two at 630pm for the following evening. I am now directed to another operator (not Mesa Grill's maybe hotel?) starts with the \"interview\": Are you a hotel guest, do you have a Rewards card, blah, blah, blah. Then the operator asks for my address and Credit Card number!!!! I was informed that I would be charged $50 if I was late or absent for my reservation. When I asked \"what is late?\", the operator's response was,\" if you do not show up at 6pm and they give away your table- one minute or 20 minutes late.\" Are you f*cking kidding me? Before I had to submit my W2 form and personal references, I declined to continue with the reservation process.   Again, I've dined here so many times and enjoyed every visit but this was enough. Mesa Grill is awesome for the food, but this \"leave a deposit for your reservation\" is ridiculous. We dined at another celebrity chef's restaurant without the hassle. Thanks, Bobby, Caesar's LV, and/or Harrah's Entertainment for screwing up the initial contact process for your Diners.",

LOVE it.  this was too much.  i don't know - after seeing some of the amazing dishes bobby's made on tv, it was just expecting more?  it's hard to put my finger on it......  just ugh.  disappointed.",

I got the ranch style eggs tostada. Perfectly cooked eggs! So delicious and great presentation. I think next time I might want to share and entree or skip the appetizers cuz the bread basket they bring is outta this world! The bread basket is filled with like 5 different kinds of breads and muffins. Corn muffins, cranberry muffins, normal bread, jalapeno cheese poppers! Carb heaven!  The decor is very glamorous and trendy. Service is attentive. There was a 10 minute wait on a Sunday around 11am. Not bad at all. You can always go to the bar to wait =P",

    "text": "I chose Mesa Grill after hearing Delmonico's is way overrated. Having eaten at the Bahamas location, and despite my aversion to Bobby Flay, I decided to give the Las Vegas MG a try.  1. Awkward seating arrangement: We had a table of six, and it seemed like they had to put a table in the middle of a seating arrangement in order to fit us. We would've been perfectly fine if the wait staff wasn't continually bumping into my friends' chairs and then asking them to move out the way. That was uncool.  2. Food was great. Everyone was really happy with their dishes. Amongst the six of us, we ordered the duck, ribeye and pork tenderloins. For sides, pesto mashed potatoes, baby carrots, tiger shrimp tamale and sauteed spinach. We had to wait a bit for a couple of the sides because the waitress forgot them, but it wasn't too bad. Food came out hot and tasty.  3. Desserts were okay. I enjoyed my spicy chocolate creme brulee in the Bahamas more than the profiteroles I had. I thought they were really stingy with the iced cream which put me off a bit.  4. Service was alright. Our waitress was chatty and came around a few times to check on us.  Mesa Grill Las Vegas didn't disappoint and I wouldn't be against visiting BF's other restaurants.",

I know it's not fair, but when there's a lot of hype, there's also a lot of hope that there's an amazing experience to back it all up!  I went into Mesa Grill with ridiculously high expectations (hello Iron Chef!) and WOW.. I didn't think they could be exceeded, but the food was a total oralgasm.  The skilled craftsmanship of bold flavors balanced against subtle undertones and lingering aftertastes is absolutely incomparable to anything else I've ever experienced in food.  Damn this man knows how to make an amazing flavor combination!!  Needless to say- the food was absolutely amazing.  The service was even quite impeccable on the day that we went.  The food, while crafty and artistic, was highly understandable and accessible since it played off of American classics.  Last but not least, the decor was crafted just as carefully as the food, blending natural woods and metals into a textural and visual gestalt of sensory pleasure.  I make it a point to visit this restaurant almost every time I'm in Vegas... I can never get enough and I dream about the next time I get to enjoy it again!",

Maybe my experience wasn't so great because my options were limited- but overall- this place was a huge disappointment.   I ordered the cactus iced tea- nothing too special about it.   We had the goat cheese appetizer that everyone is always raving about and it was nothing more than melted goat cheese with some peppers in it which tasted average. It was so rich we only ate about 25% of it.   My husband ordered a breakfast enchilada and I ordered the bacon and hash brown quesadilla (off the appetizer side of the menu). In both items, the tortilla was too hard, undercooked, and heavy tasting. My husband's food tasted no different than normal breakfast food (just eggs and chorizo inside). Mine was disgusting- too much goat cheese grilled on the top, not enough bacon inside (hardly any) and the hash brown with the tortillas didn't taste right at all (bad combination but I thought it might taste ok).   My experience has been that all of the newer places in Vegas have tasted great- because they are still establishing themselves. The other places that have been around for a while no longer care to maintain themselves and have been mediocre to disappointing. The only exception to that has been Nobu.  I wish we would have gone to Mon Ami Gabi or one of the high end buffets at Bellagio or the Wynn instead- it would have cost the same and no doubt tasted better!",

    "text": "Another delicious comped company dinner. Sure, the economy sucks hairy ones..but on the bright side of things, at least I get to eat well when I am hard at work during conferences!  Tonight's selection was Mesa - the fiery headed Bobby Flay's restaurant. It was kind of a last minute decision which meant that all the tables were reserved, so we had to settle for the area behind the bar that is best suited for drinks and appetizers at most.  This was a tad impractical and we had to deal with the constant flow of people traffic that siphoned between our seating area and the bar, but the food was good enough to send me on a euphoric high that I could care less that I had to eat a 5 star meal using my white napkin covered quadriceps as a makeshift table.  To start, we had the goat cheese queso fundido (a.k.a. fancy pants nachos w/ gourmet cheese) and crispy squid (a.k.a. calamari). My main course was the blue corn crusted halibut and a side of roasted corn. I had one of their signature margaritas and it was good - but nothing out of the ordinary.  Everything was so rich and seasoned to create what I can only articulate as a marvelous explosion of flavor overload. The exhibition kitchen was a nice touch, too. This is so not the place for you if you like bland or simple food.  Mr. Flay puts the TA-DOW! How ya like me now! in your plate.",

There was a $29 special lunch menu that seemed to be a great deal, but I decided to order off the normal menu.  Bread: the bread basket was very good. The jalapeno corn muffins were terrific, as was the raisin walnut bread (and I hate raisins).    Appetizer: Had the goat cheese queso fundido, which was out of this world.  I love queso and I love goat cheese, so this was a perfect item for me.  It came with blue corn tortilla chips that were very fresh.  Drink: the Cactus Pear Iced Tea was very unique and tasty, and included free refills.  Entree: I was deciding between the Spicy Chicken Hash and the Peanut BBQ Chicken Tacos.  Ben recommended the Hash so I went with that.  It was spicy chicken mixed in with sweet potato, poached egg, and a green chile sauce.  It was a unique dish and I loved it.  The portion was huge as well- I have a big appetite and I couldn't even finish it.  Overall bill was $36 before tip.  Quite a good value for the amount of food I got, from a place that once had a Michelin star.",

    "text": "First off let me just say that I do not believe this place is worth going to for dinner. For the money, you can get much better food at countless restaurants on the strip. You don't need a white guy from NYC introducing you to Southwest cuisine. If you care about Iron Chef, excited about the idea of paying $18 for a tamale or can't experience something like Yucatan flavors where you're from, then I say go for it.   With all that being said, I have been here for brunch two times and had a decent experience. The prices are reasonable, they have straight forward dishes and I was able to get mezcal, which isn't so easy to find in Vegas. My girlfriend and I were going to be in Vegas for Christmas and I thought this would be a good option for Holiday brunch. I called and made a reservation for brunch and there was no mention made of any changes. When we got there, the restaurant was noticibly empty and we were told that brunch was not being served for Christmas, and only the dinner menu (not even the lunch menu) was available. The waiter mentioned that he was sorry and this has resulted in several walkouts throughout the day. We walked out and I felt terrible because the loss of business affects the wait staff as much as anybody and it was Christmas. However, we came specifically for brunch, was never told that only the dinner menu would be available and as I mentioned earlier, wouldn't pay for the dinner fare. I know this is extremely case specific, but the whole experience was a major letdown and perhaps it is magnified more because it was Christmas. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this place anyways except for brunch.   -JRS",

At 9:30, the lobby, bar, and host area were standing room only as guests eagerly awaited the raved culinary creations of Bobby Flay. Everything was perfect, except two minor flaws in the meal. The pork dish comes with a sweeter, barbecue like glaze on the side that detracts from the peppery rub and flavor of the meat and the house margaritas were too tart. For top dollar, you think they could make a better margarita.",

    "text": "My mother & I went here for dinner on my birthday and were not disappointed. We were hooked from the first bite of the appetizers and the first sip of the margarita.   Our waiter was friendly, informative and made great suggestions.   When the bread basket comes to the table, go for the yellow & blue corn muffin. I am going to make these at home as soon as I find some blue corn meal.  We started with the Crispy Squash Blossoms and the Corn Soup. The yellow pepper sauce for the squash blossoms was spicy but taking a bite of everything together was a perfect harmony. The corn soup, which was a special, was heaven in a bowl. Blended to a smooth velvety consistency and was sweet with a smokey tomato salsa and a drizzle of chili oil.  The dinner portions were larger than I thought they'd be. The only problem this caused was that we still needed room for dessert. Our entrees, New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin, Southwestern Spiced Duck Breast and a side of Roasted Corn, looked like works art. The flavor combinations were amazing. There were three nice cuts of dark crusted tenderloin standing on the plate in a puddle of bourbon-ancho sauce and a drizzle of cilantro oil. What can I say about the duck except who new that carrot and habanero would work together. You can't go wrong with either of these dishes. My only complaint would be that I wish the tamales were warmer, but still enjoyed them. Put it this way, I'll be trying to make these at home too. We really didn't have room for the Roasted Corn but the slight smokey, buttery, cheesy, tanginess was worth it.   Last but not least, the dessert. The Blackberry-Mango Crostada and Cafe con Leche Flan were both highly recommended by our waiter. I love blackberry and mango so this was a no-brainer and the vanilla-blackberry ice cream was the star of this dessert. I also love coffee and this was not your normal custard style flan. This was like eating a coffee mousse with a thin caramel sauce around it and vanilla whipped cream on top.  I will be back.",

Who knew dinner also came with a show?  Our server was a spritely Eastern European who gave us the inside scoop on all the celebrity diners (Girls Next Door, super nice, Simpson sisters, bitches) as well as a fascinating and slightly inappropriate monologue on the price of beauty in Vegas.

Both were excellent and we were very pleased with our meals.   I also had some fancy (must've been for $16!) margarita that the waiter said was some special drink and something about Oprah (I'll try anything that Oprah likes!!).

You can read my Stack review to see what went very wrong there. But we've been to Mesa Grill four times now, and it will always be our must-go-to restaurant in Vegas.    Our dinner was late, after 9:30 p.m., Saturday, Caesar's, Vegas.  Energy level in the restaurant was marvelous, great wait and host staff, terrific sommelier, wonderful wine choice (well, that was OUR choice, but still, to have Fiddlehead Fiddlestix on the menu is amazing in and of itself).    The bread is the best (esp. that little corn muffin with the chilis....we fight over it!).  Great vodka choices for before dinner.  Hubby had the pork tenderloin--it is their killer dish.  I always get something different, so I had the chile relleno and it was wonderful--crispy crunchy crust (not doughy), a poblano chile of top quality, filled with goat cheese, eggplant, yuuuuumy.  Not huge, but just enough and just great.    The BEST.",

Service was prompt, we had drinks and menus and a run down of the best things to order within 2 minutes of being seated. You start out with various baked savory/sweet pastries while waiting for the food. The chilaquiles were really good and i was glad that they didn't skimp on portion size. My friend got the ranch style tostada which was ok but the sauce was surprisingly sweet, almost too sweet. The drinks (mango&carrot juice and the blood mary) were a nice compliment to the meals, I'd probably order both of them again.   This is a great place that's more on the casual-upscale side compared to other restaurants on the Strip and the food is worth going back for, especially because the service was so quick (we finished a full meal in 1 hour)! One quick tip: their napkins are super linty, don't put them on your clothes!",

    "text": "Visiting Vegas means splurging at least once on yourself.  This was my gift to me.  I've long wanted to dine at one of Bobby Flay's restaurants.  Not knowing when I'd have the opportunity again, I hiked all over Ceasar's Palace in my search for lunch.  I like that they had a Prix Fixe lunch menu for those of us who want to tour around the menu and don't know where to start.  I loved my waitress Catherine, who while overstretched and busy, was attentive to a lone diner.  Without even having to ask, she searched out the pastry chef, realizing that there was a nut allergy, so that I could eat my lovely dessert.  I loved that they seated me at a table, instead of the bar, even with luggage in tow.  For the appetizer I had  the blue Corn Pancake, which is a very succulent BBQ'd duck in a blue corn pancake with a habanero chile sauce with a hint of anise.   For the Entree I had the Seared Sea scallops.  I wish I knew what it was, I think the searing and basting method made it taste a little off.  The sweetness of the scallops was missing. For dessert the chef's selection was a Banana's Foster ice cream with a hazelnut brittle.  YUM   I would give Mesa 3.75 stars I think.  Things didn't come off as expected of a Celebrity Chef experience. The bread served with the meal was cold.  My waitress was stretched beyond the limit, meaning I had to wait a considerable amount of time before I could touch my ice cream.  (Deathly allergic to macadamias...I don't mess around).  The appetizer, not the entree, stole the show.",

    "text": "I have been a fan of Bobby Flay for a long time and was really excited to try this place out. I was with two of my friends from Australia and wanted to show them a bit of southwest cuisine. Coming from Arizona, I have very high expectations on southwest food.   We decided to go for lunch, since reading the review that dinner is busier. The atmosphere was pretty laid back, all the customers where in shorts and flip flops. So It was strange to me that the hostess told one of my friends to remove their hat because they had a strict dress code (uh everyone is in shorts and flip flops???)  I knew exactly what I wanted (from reading yelp reviews) but decided to test the waiter. I asked him what he would recommend. He then proceeded to tell me \"everything\" ...OK seriously, what would you recommend? He then pointed to some fish thing and said \"this looks good\" Test failed!!!   My two Australian friends ordered the shrimp and chicken tacos. I decided to order the pork sandwich. The waiter told me that this is a cold sandwich with warm bread. Me: \"Uh can you throw it in the oven or something\" him: \"No\"- I decided to give it a shot, why not Bobby Flay should know what he is doing. The waiter was extremely prompt about refilling our waters, maybe a little to eager, every time I took a drink he refilled.   The bread basket came out and me being a carbholic I was so excited for the bread. I tried the Jalapeno one first and thought it was OK. Tasted like something I could get at my local grocery store bakery. I then tried the \"famous\" blue corn. It was super fragile I lifted it and it fell apart in my hand. The piece I did get was mushy and looked undercooked. I did not finish the rest. My Australian friends took a bite and said it tasted funny.   The food was so disappointing!!   The shrimp tacos came out with literally 3 pieces of shrimp and two small tortillas. Uh where the heck is the rest of the food! Same with the chicken tacos. My two Friends ate them in a matter of minutes. My pork sandwich was considerably bigger. But was so weird being that it was cold pulled pork with pieces of fat. Pork fat cold is not tasty at all. I will give them this- the Mexican fries it came with were tasty- but anyone can throw cilantro on some fries and get the same thing.   I was so disappointed and not to mention my friends were hungry 5 min after we left the restaurant. For being such a big name Bobby Flay needs to reconnect with the local level cuisine. Come to Arizona and experience what real southwest cuisine taste like.   If you want mediocre southwest cuisine go to Mesa Grill - other wise save your money and try a different restaurant.   PS I am no longer a fan of Bobby Flay!!!!!",

I had the cactus pear margarita and it was wonderful!!!  The waiter recommended it.  I also had the shrimp  and tamale appetizer and as expected the sauce was fantastic.  My grilled salmon was undercooked (cold center), but flavors were nice.  Bread basket didn't blend-three very different breads with very crumbly corn muffin. At my table we also had goat cheese fondue - lighter than expected and not too strong; sixteen spice chicken with coriander mashed potatoes - I am totally going to make those potatoes; black bean and chicken quesadilla- too smoky and dry; corn crusted chili relleno - yummy eggplant inside, but cornmeal crust was like sand -awful texture.  My recommendation would be to go for drinks and appetizers.  Try a nice sample of small dishes to share and toast your savvy menu choices with a lovely margarita.",

I arrived at 7:45 for my 8pm reservation and asked if my seat is ready, instead of getting a warm welcome or sort, all I got just a NO from that lady.  Just fyi I work in the restaurant industry for 8 years and I respect people regardless but the attitude i got from this hostess in this level of restaurant, in this kind of location is just unacceptable and it made me lost my appetite.  She also ignored me when i asked her the second time(after 15 minute delay), not only that she actually tell me to move out from her way because there are people behind me waiting....???!!! and that what really flipped me off.  Luckily the server, busser on our table are really friendly and welcoming. They heard about what hppnd and apologiZe to us sincerely and I felt bad because it wasnt their mistake. All and all the mgmt need to be more detail in training their employee regarding manner, stereotyping is a bad behavior, just because  im an asian with my dslr, it doesnt mean im a tourist where maybe you could just ignored me and give me your 3rd world country attitude toward me KELLY.",

    "text": "We are locals, and came down to the Strip for a celebration dinner.  Mesa Grill books up, so reservations are essential.  We arrived at our appointed time and were immediately seated.  We had a nice view of the open kitchen and serving window, so it was easy to spot some of the popular dishes as we were contemplating our order. The assistant waiter promptly came over and offered water. Then, the only hiccup of the evening.  It took 10 minutes for the waiter to stop by and greet us and take drink orders.  Service after that was just fine.  For $240 (inclusive of tax and a 20% tip), our party of two had:  3 really great margaritas.  they have 3 different varieties.  I had the one that was described as part tart, part sweet.  It was pink in color. Really good.  2 appetizers:  tiger shrimp tamale and lobster tacos.  both were outstanding.  as others have stated, the tacos are small.  however, when paired with a complete multicourse meal, they are perfect.  2 entrees:  veal chop and lamb chop.  both came with a side tamale, so we didn't order extra sides.  The veal chop may have been the best I've ever had.  Really delicious.  The lamb was very good, but not as outstanding as the veal chop.  1 desert:  shared the banana cream pudding.  It was good, but could have used a bit more banana flavor.  The atmosphere here can border on loud.  You are adjacent to the casino, and although the windows separating the restaurant from the casino are floor to ceiling, they have a louvered effect, so both sound, and sadly, cigarette smoke enter the restaurant.  The smoke is not too bad, but it is noticeable.  This was our second visit, the first being lunch.  Would definitely return again.  Just remember, for dinner especially, make a reservation!",

Brunch has some AWESOME Bloody Mary's! I thought the menu provided a good mix of choices and loved the huevos rancheros and burger I had on my brunch visits.  The group dinner was for a girls' weekend and it was the first time any of us had eaten here. We had a mix of all types of eaters and everyone loved their meals! We all ordered different things and passed forks around the table to sample each others entrees. It was such a fun atmosphere and great group dinner!  Don't forget to check out the drink specials - there are some awesome margaritas on the menu!",

Maybe the bread assortment could have been a little warmer when it was brought to the table, but that is the only fault I could find. We ordered from the Restaurant Week $50 dinner menu. The roasted garlic corn tamale with tiger shrimp was sweet and spicy with perfect texture. My wife, who usually hates tamales, ate every bite. The ancho chile honey glazed salmon was perfectly prepared, and may be the best salmon I have ever eaten. The creamy roasted corn side was worth every penny extra. The corn bread previously mentioned has layers of yellow and blue corn sprinkled with bits of spicy peppers. Service by Christopher and others was impeccable despite a full house. Mesa Grill has been the top donor to the Three Square Food Bank through the Restaurant Week program for 5+ years in a row. Maybe this Flay guy knows what he's doing after all?",

But hey, it's right by a sports book area in Caesar's Palace.   Tiger shrimp and garlic roasted tamale was extremely tasty. Might have liked it better than my entree. I got the salmon and wife got tuna steak. Both were very good. My salmon had a fantastic crust with a semi-sweet ancho chile sauce. I was jealous of my wife's tuna steak. It was prepared rare as it's sashimi-grade of course and it was bangin! Plating was awesome and the flavors popped with every bite.   We got the Pomegranate Brussel Sprouts on the side. I was nervous because I've never had Brussel Sprouts and hear all the child horror stories. Boy was I relieved. This side was awesome! The pomegranate pairing was perfect and the sprouts were full of this nutty, roasted flavor. YUM-O!  Don't know why he lost a Michelin star a couple years ago but who cares, I give it a Good Year star.",

In the case of Mesa Grill, we didn't really notice Mr. Flay's influence in that the meals we ordered didn't particularly stand out from any other restaurant of this type.  We were a party of six celebrating a birthday.  Overall the service was very good and responsive. Oddly, they don't have salt and pepper shakers at the tables. I asked the server to bring it. She never did. Must have spaced it.  I ordered the $50 bone in-ribeye. Couldn't get much flavor out of it. Gee I missed the salt and pepper.  Others at our table said they enjoyed their meal. No one was \"over the top\" in their praise.  The side dishes were ridiculously small and absurdly overpriced.  The setting was beautiful - lots of glass with casino views.  I suppose Mesa Grill qualifies as a moderate to high priced \"upscale\" restaurant on the Las Vegas Strip. It's about what I expected in a tourist trap town.",

    "text": "Note that when you make reservations they take your cc so they can charge you $50 a head if you ditch so try not to.  I wasn't quite sure what to expect coming here, but overall it was a decent meal at a place where you're paying extra for the star power of Mr. Bobby Flay.  All sides come separately, but is usually enough to share if you want to get a few sides to share among friends.  The decor was interesting.  Lots of  bright colors and had flames all over.  The selection of drinks had a great list of tequilas to choose from.  The cuisine is Bobby Flay's famous TexMex Style.  Random note: no hats haha, I was told to take mine off.  I know it's Vegas so don't count on a hat to hide the fact that you were too lazy to spend 5 mins on your hair just because you were up till 6 am the night before.  Service was decent and friendly.  They told us our table would be ready near reservation time (8:15).  Our table was not.  Haha we waited about another 30 mins.  To be fair the place was pretty packed.  The food! Bone-In Ribeye: Well cooked piece of meat.  The server will tell you the house recommends Medium unless you want your steak mooing near the bone (not quite in those words).  It's a big piece of meat.  You will probably be full haha.  My friend was getting meat sweats eating the thing!  I didn't feel that the random toppings and sauces that gave it the TexMex theme were necessary.  Tuna \"Nachos\": Appetizer dish.  Blue corn and Potato? Chips to handle what was basically some rough cut tuna tartar.  The tuna had some mango habanero sauce on the plate that was quite good.  The tuna itself was good, but seemed a bit bland to me.  The potato chip was flaky and seemed to be created by pressing multiple layers together.  Spinach: Side dish.  Pretty standard sauteed spinach.  Garlic Tamale: Small Tamale with a big pat of garlic butter in the center.  Again, good, but not amazing.  Also I was getting so full from the steak it was hard to finish off the tamale.  Overall, it's not a bad place, but with the gluttony of food in Vegas, I think you can probably do better.  Especially if all you're looking for is a good steak.",

    "text": "Oh Mesa Grill!  How you have swept me off my feet.    My coworker and I came here based on a cab's recommendation and boy was I glad I listened.  Luckily, it was the beginning of restaurant week, so I got to try a variety of things for $50.  The Strawberry Fields cocktail drink was quite lovely with fresh strawberries, mint, and cucumber vodka.  Pink, sweet, and refreshing after walking around all day in the heat! :)    I must say the breads were WONDERFUL.  They were not your average breads.  We were given an assortment of three...I can't remember exactly what they were...but one was almost like a soft corn meal muffin with bits of herbs inside, another was more of a chewy bread with jalapeno bits, the last had raisin bits.  All different and unique.  I had to stop myself from eating the entire basket.  The roasted corn soup was SOOO good.  It was slightly spicy, creamy as can be, and incredibly sweet. The fried okra bits and green chile sauce (?) drizzled on top just made it even better.  I know I should not have ordered an appetizer, but I had the grilled shrimp with tamale and corn. It was a symphony of textures and flavors: juicy shrimp, grainy yet smooth tamales, pop of sweetness from the corn, creaminess of the sauce.   The New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin with chile sauce and sweet potato tamale...ohies..I cannot even finish this sentence as my mouth is watering.  The three miniature columns of tenderloin were juicy and flavorful.  It was interesting to see how the tamale from the shrimp appetizer was savory, but this sweet potato tamale was sweet, almost like dessert with the slight crunch of the pecans.  I was just sad that I was not able to eat much of it as I was already full from the appetizer and soup.    For dessert I had the roasted strawberry-gooseberry shortcake with vanilla whipped cream.  The shortcake is not like your traditional soft spongy shortcake.  Rather, it has a firm cornmeal texture.  It was pretty good, but I can't say it was my favorite part of the meal.  One thing I would have hoped for was for the dishes to be SPICER, but I would highly recommend this place.  It has a wonderful, warm, inviting decor that is not too hip or stuffy so you can choose to dress up or down.  The food is exciting and fun and I cannot wait to go back again and/or visit the New York location.   I never cared much for Bobby Flay before (I like Paula and Giada...lol), but after that night I was completely sold.  Mad props.",

The food was good but in the past it has been GREAT. The service was not up to par either. Our waitress was kind of disinterested, although her bus people were terrific.   We had the pork loin, one of the three pieces on my plate was full of gristle, when I explained this to our waitress she said \"oh, I'm sorry\" and walked away. The filet was great but some of the sides were not served with the meal and were brought as an after thought.   It was kind of strange when I made reservations I was asked if it was a special occasion and I replied it was our anniversary.  The person on the phone said \"we like to do something special on special occasions\" so I'm thinking \"cool, free dessert\".  Well, the best we can figure the \"something special\" is your waiter saying \"Happy Anniversary\".  Not all that special!   Nothing was terrible and we might give it another try next time we are in Vegas..",

While visiting vegas my friend and I decided that if there was one Iron chef restaurant we would make it to might as well make it a Bobby Flay restaurant and go for what he is known for.. some good grilled meat (steak and burgers in our case) with some heat. The burger was okay, nothing to write home about and there really wasnt much of a kick in the salsa they provided alongside of it. And Im a whuss when it comes to heat.. so I should have been able to feel it. My friend ordered the steak which was also good.. but not great. Being from Chicago and having been lucky enough to try some great food from well known chefs, I guess I almost always expect to be amazed by the food coming out of these kitchens..but that didnt quite happen. Plus the wait staff just seemed so disinterested in what they were doing. Not sure if it was just because they're stuck inside a casino all day..or they really didnt want to be there anymore.. but a smile could have changed this experience a whole lot more.",

The stock with the cilantro and peppers blended in left something to be desired.  The seafood was good so it wasn't a total failure but the broth...eh.   The tamale with the tiger shrimp was good.  A big improvement over the dry starchy everyday tamale.   The Yucatan Chicken Tacos reminded me of Peking duck with the hoisen like BBQ sauce and the vietnamese style herbs (more cilantro and mint).  Messy but good.  Pan Seared Squid = Fail.  It wasn't memorable except for the fact that I remember not enjoying it when I was eating it.    Oh and the cocktails are lovely.  I think that is why I can only remember four dishes, though I believe I had more.   Just to vent - this is a popular restaurant in Las Vegas so they should assume that some people do not have the foresight to make reservations and will inevitably opt to eat in the bar/lounge area.  Maybe they should make the lounge tables more conducive to eating...like make the tables more than 18 inches in diameter when each plate is more than 12 inches wide.",

When I went back I got the GOAT CHEESE \"QUESO FUNDIDO\" and the Mashed Potatoes+ Green Chile Queso Sauce and both were great.

Had a hard time deciding between 4 and 5 stars, Mainly because the appetizers, salad, and sides are all 5 star but the entrees I've had are 4. I usually get a salad, app, and a side or two. I end up here on most of my Vegas trips and it is one of my favorite spots. You need reservations as it is always booked. I've snuck in and eaten at the bar a couple times but there is usually a wait for that. I LOVE the Sophie's salad and get it every time. For me it is the perfect salad, with baby romaine, garbanzos, kidneys, sharp white cheddar cubes, tiny toritlla pieces, kalamatas, cilantro, fresh chives and the dressing is a sweetish balsamic. Love the tuna nachos and the tamale side, but all the apps and sides are perfect. The specialty margaritas and mojoitos are ok but I like to get the beer.",

    "text": "Not much to add that hasn't been said before so I will reiterate what I found helpful. I've been for both brunch and dinner - equally amazing whichever way you go, but brunch is a serious fraction of the dinner cost (less than half). First tip: share everything.  It means you can experiment with more foods, and the portions are pretty crazy (especially the steaks).  Personally, for my husband and I we do 2 apps, 1 steak and 2 sides for dinner.  For breakfast, we did 1 app and 2 entrees.  Second tip: order the margarita that they advertise as the perfect margarita (it's pretty close).  Third tip: order the tiger shrimp tamale appetizer, the one that was featured on the Best Food I Ever Ate (it is that good).    Only drawback is that the place is popular, which means a few things you have to just accept and move past so they don't ruin the experience: reservations on popular weekends have to be made weeks in advance (on Halloween weekend we had to reserve with a credit card and $50 no show commitment), the reservation time doesn't always correlate to the time you will be seated (on busy nights the place is definitely overbooked), bar area is small so waiting for your table with a drink in hand is harder than it should be. Lastly, while the servers have always been very knowledgeable, cool and have a pretty iron clad spiel to pump you up about the impending awesomeness of your meal, the front desk is a bit snotty (especially for a place with cowhide covered seats) and you just have to brush off the attitude.",

So, we had brunch hoping to like it as much as our dinner. No such luck. The breakfast bread basket was average - the variety was exciting but none of the items were actually very good. We shared two average dishes - the Tiger Shrimp and Garlic Corn Tamale and the Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad.   The tamale was average and smothered in so much corn. The salad was actually very good a variety of lettuce and lots of chicken, but way overdressed. The dressing hung all over the lettuce the last few bites weren't edible.   The only thing we really loved was the Mango Glazed Bacon - it was $3.50 for four slices and was by far my favorite part of the meal.   The service dropped off after we got our food and we spent too much time waiting for our plates to be cleared, then to get a dessert menu (we declined), then to get the check, and then to have our credit card picked up. Ugh. Nothing impressive and nothing like what we remembered from our dinner visit to Mesa Grill.",

    "text": "This was our first time at Mesa Grill and after such a bad experience it will also be our last. We'd made reservations well in advance, seated no problem. My wife is diabetic; we asked our waiter if my wife could simply substitute out sauces; he steamrolled over our questions, telling us which sauces would be fine. Ok. She ordered the swordfish, my son and I both ordered the pork tenderloin. We both sub'd the chorizo & goat cheese tamale for the sweet potato version.  When the food came out (different waiter) we explained again that my wife could not have some of the sauces; he was super, swapped in more tomatillo salsa. However, the tamales were just so sweet that I told the waiter we had gotten the wrong ones. They were cloyingly sweet, and there was no goat cheese detectable, absolutely no taste of chorizo. So then he started arguing with me, pointing to one or two 1/4\" size pieces. I told him there was no way this could be the chorizo tamale. So what does he do? Brings out two more. Same thing, dessert sweet, tiny piece of  goat cheese added on top. I tell him the same thing,  Finally, manager comes over with two MORE tamales (one of each). I tell him there's no need, just that we can't be getting the right one. He goes to check with the chef and sure enough, he says they add sugar to the masa. Manager was very gracious, told him we'd had nothing but attitude from waiter. Again, apologetic, but our meal ruined by now so I pass on dessert that's part of my meal.  They don't swap waiters. Check comes, no break at all. I left 0 tip which I never do; but if the manager reads this, he knows which waiter needs to be blamed for this bad dining experience. Huge disappointment.",

The pork tenderloin is my favorite, I have had it 3 different ways, all equally great. The prices are reasonable for the strip and what you get, but if price is your concern go in for lunch.

    "text": "Was very excited to try this resturant out. Like some of other reviewers, am a Bobby Flay fan. There were 4 of us in our party - 2 adults & 2 kids under age of 10.  Menu varies for lunch & dinner. We chose to go for an early dinner - around 5-ish. We were seated right away in the back part of resturant in a round table. Was a nice \"view\" of the resturant, cooking stations, and other tables. Perhaps a little less noisy than the rest of the place. We were able to talk amongst ourselves just fine. (Even share a bit of conversation wtih members of the table right next to us.)  Adults had the Tuna steak. (I really enjoyed it medium-rare. My husband had it med-well.) The poblano-peppercorn sauce was tasty and married well with the couscus. Our portions were a good size, I thought. We also had an order of the lobster tacos - good flavor. I agree wth Cat P. that the asiago cheese jalapeno bread was the best of all the breads in the bread basket ;-)   We initially were going to order a couple apps for the kids - but our waiter suggested a burger or cheese burger for them. (Nice touch! And worth the $12 for a grade-A burger w/ fries.)  They enjoyed refillable sodas/lemonaide. While the adults drank tasty margaritas - go ahead, try the signature White peach Margarita!    Desert... ah, the finishing touch on a great meal. We shared 2 deserts: toasted coconut cake and banana cream pie. Not too sweet and hit the spot.   Service notes: Our waitstaff was attentive, knowledgable about the menu, and were delightful with the two kids.  What we might do differently next time: Say no to the mineral water ($8.50 per bottle was a bit too spendy.)  It was a good meal that came with a price. It could be considered your \"big spend\" item while visiting. We would consider coming back (just with Adults).   Save a Margarita for me.....!",

    "text": "We arrived at Mesa at exactly 5:00 pm, ready to just pop in with no reservations as if we owned the place.  Not so much.  The place was already booked well in advance (damn) but lucky for us, we were able to secure some great seats at the bar.  Frankly, I think you get great (attentive) service at the bar because you're right in the face of the bartender - hard to be ignored right?  I came here with my partner on the recommendation of a colleague.  She was right.  I really liked it.  Okay, the prices were a bit ridonkulous but I'm a foodie and will pay up from time to time.   We started out with the tiger shrimp tamale - an appetizer large enough to share.  Tasty, yummy, damn fine masa.  My partner got the filet (he asked everyone).  It was an expensive but expansive cut of meat.  The crusted exterior softly cut through to a medium rare center.  I don't think I've seen a filet mignon cooked as close to perfection as this one.  The spicy crust was incredible.  As for me, I went vegie, which I never do, but was really thinking that the chile relleno with eggplant looked interesting.  It was and is was good.  It's hard to describe this monstrosity of goodness.  It was huge and I ate every damn bit of it.    We felt compelled to get a side dish (twice baked potato) but really upon reflection, it was unnecessary.  Our bill capped out at close to $200 with drinks but the experience was worth it.  I'd give it five stars but the location inside Caesers left a (lot) to be desired.  You can't really truly away from the casino vibe even in a well-appointed restaurant.",

    "text": "$200/person? I'm not sure what the previous reviewer ordered, but for 3 appetizers, 4 entrees and 1 dessert our total came out to just over $200. I always thought Bobby Flay was kind of douchey and I never really had any interest in going to one of his restaurants, but Throwdown came on when I was really hungry and I was hooked and made a reservation for my bf's bday dinner at Mesa Grill.  I must say, I was pretty impressed. Everything we ate was delicious and the service was top notch. We started out with the tiger shrimp with tamale, the blue corn pancake with duck and the wild mushroom grits. I don't know what kind of sauce they put on the shrimp but it was soooo good. As were the wild mushroom grits with a perfectly poached egg. If they threw some bacon on that I could eat it for breakfast every day! The only slight disappointment was the blue corn pancake. I was expecting something more along the lines of a large blini and instead it was like a soft taco.   For our entrees my dad had the chicken, which I don't know if it was fried, but it had a very different crust on the outside. The bf ordered the fish, I think it was halibut and he didn't really like the accompanying sauce which he said was like bbq sauce. They also thought the portions were a bit small and their dishes didn't come with any sides. My mom had the veal with a wild rice tamale and I had the pork tenderloin with a sweet potato tamale, both of which were very generous portions and very tasty. Ok, now here comes my one gripe...yes, corn is southwestern, but if you notice, I swear everything here comes with a cornmeal-something. We started out with cornbread, then there were tamales with the shrimp, blue corn pancakes, grits, more tamales with the entrees, and if you wanted, there was even cornbread pudding for dessert. I don't think we gravitated toward cornmeal everything, but there is just a ton of it on the menu.   We were stuffed by the time dessert rolled around and we split the banana hazlenut sundae. It had these tiney bruleed bananas on top and a fig sauce. Very nice.  I would love to come back here again, but there are many more Vegas restaurants to be tried and tasted first!",

I ordered scallops for my main course and they were too salty for me.  There were 4 jumbo scallops on the plate but I could only eat 3 because of the saltiness.

Keep in mind the place was empty, literally only the 6 of us and few folks at the bar.. So we sed we would wait at the bar til the restuarant fully opened.. we did so and when the restuarant finally open we were told there was no tables available for us again the restuarant was empty just us and patrons at the bar so we decided to eat at the bar. food was made and delivered quickly, steak was made under par, chicken also made under par for a place of an owner with such caliber we at least though the food would be decent.. sadly food, price, fail, ambiance is only plus everything else FAIL!!  oh if I give them anything, the drinks are made well, other then that go to wolfgang pucks restuarant at least you wont be shunned there by the waitress.  food - * 1/2 & im being nice i could of went to sizzler and got better prepp'd meat service - negative 5 stars if the waitress dont want to help folks find another job like a pole dancer haha ambiance **** the place is awesome the look and feel to it, but the service makes the experience all negative",

I ordered the fish and it was good while in the restaurant.  I did not have any alcohol or dessert or anything else after dinner, since I have an early flight out and wanted a light dinner.  So much for my uneventful night.  It is a real disappointment, especially since I really enjoy southwest cuisine.",

The quality of food, service and facilities was truly surprising especially in Las Vegas where everyone seems to be out to take your money.  Service was absolutely 4 Star without attitude.  The staff at our table seemed genuinely friendly and their performance was spot-on.  The flavors layered in the food were incredible and I found myself continuously amazed at the creativity.  The pork tenderloin is a thing of beauty...fork tender and delicious.  This is a place where the line cooks have really been taught to recreate something fantastic.  I pushed away from the table and left hoping that I could return again quickly.",

A salad made with five cents worth of food for eighteen bucks. Service that disappears if you have a comment that is not what they want to hear. Bobby Flay needs to get in there and raise some hell...the quality is crap. Any Michelin should be a tire mark. Substitutions of fish types without telling the customer. Will never go back.",

I could have ordered the wrong thing, but seriously, shouldn't everything on the menu be amazing?  I ordered the spicy chicken and sweet potato hash.  The sweet potato was diced and mixed in with diced chicken.  I barely had any chicken in the mix of my dish.  Flavor wise the whole dish was average.  It seemed like everyone was getting the steak and eggs, so you should probably go for that if you ever try this place.  Dont get the chicken and sweet potato hash or else you'll be disappointed like me.  I will probably never come back to Mesa grill because of that dish.",

I originally ordered a bottle of wine my wife and I like....HOWEVER the waiter was INSISTENT we order some Spanish wine he was recommending. It almost seemed like a contest they were having to see who could move more of that wine out the door. I went ahead and ordered \"his recommendation\" and is was just OK. NOTE TO WAIT STAFF - BRING THE CUSTOMER WHAT THEY ORDER! For food we ordered the Pork Chop and Chili Glazed Rib-Eye. BOTH were FABULOUS! I'd love to give Five Stars on the review but the service is lacking / odd. We'll probably not come back and try other restaurants on the strip for future visits (like all of those by the Venetian).",

    "text": "The restaurant is tucked away on the Casino floor and has a sort of wide open, airy, cheerful layout and feel. Very friendly staff and some of the best service we have experienced. They were genuinely interested in telling us about the menu and the dishes and the attention to our needs was simply top notch.   We started with the Tomato soup which was really good with a slight twist. With that we were given three types of bread! Not generic off the shelf stuff, these were really delicious and offered great variety with the soup. Nice start to a meal.  The main course was Chile Releno and Spicy chicken Hash. Superb presentation is key and these did not disappoint, they looked clean and perfectly laid out on the plate. In a sea of generic Pasta and meat, here were two unique takes an seemingly common dishes. The Chile Relleno was stuffed with chewy eggplant and a delicious red pepper sauce. The only criticism is that the portion is rather meager and for a main course Vegetarian dish, they should consider doubling it up. The chicken with potato hash was superbly put together with a perfectly cooked egg. It all came together with some delicious sauce on the side. A+ in coming up with something different with sensible flavors. Again maybe the portions are probably a bit on the lighter side for heavy eaters.  We ended with a carrot cake Cream cheese ice cream sandwich that was okay, while not A+ it's certainly a good dessert to share. I would work on the proportions of the dish a bit and maybe consider something to go along with it that offers some tangy/zesty type flavor.  Overall though our experience was stellar, we even saw Bobby himself walk in towards the end of our meal. If you don't like the experience when the Master himself is in the house, then it's just not worth it, but in this case its quite the opposite.   Maybe it was his presence but hopefully they are always this good. The overall experience was one of the best we have had in Vegas and a fine example of creative thinking in a sea of generic \"upscale\" dishes. Kudos Bobby we will be visiting again next time.",

    "text": "Several years ago I went to the Mesa Grill for Lunch. It was OK, but nothing special. I went again the other day for Dinner and was blown away. We were shown to our table by the very courteous staff. Then our server came over and answered all the questions we had about the menu. We asked a lot of questions, and she had answers for all of them and never seemed in a hurry to move away from us.  As an appetizer I had the roasted corn soup. It was so wonderfully creamy and tasty that I would have been happy with two more bowls as my entree and desert. It was that good. For my main course I ordered the New Mexican Spiced Rubbed Pork Tenderloin. This had a nice spice rub that had a bit of heat to it. If you don't care for spicy foods you need to stay away from this one. But, if you enjoy a bit of heat then this dish will give you a taste sensation you have probably never had before. The meet was tender and cooked to perfection. The Bourbon and Ancho Chile Sauce complemented it very well and gave it more depth. I ordered a side of mashed potatoes with a Green Chile Queso sauce. This was tasty as well and complemented the pork very nicely. My wife had the Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chop and loved it.  For desert my wife and I shared the Toasted Coconut Layer Cake. This was a little slice of heaven. The coconut was a nice brown and not heavily caked on the outside. It was just lightly applied. The cake to frosting ratio was nice. There were four layers of cake and the total frosting was about the same as one of the layers. It was nice and thin.  We both enjoyed ourselves very much. I know we will be going back again.",

If you are in Vegas, making the trip through the maze in Caesars Palace to find Mesa Grill is 100% worth it.  My husband had the coffee encrusted filet mignon with a side of spiced sweet potatoes.  He swears it was probably the best steak he has ever had! (This from Mr. \"Always orders the steak\"). I wasn't as hungry, so I opted for an appetizer.  I thoroughly enjoyed the tiger prawns, roasted garlic tamale, and cilantro sauce.  The food was amazing at the tables on either side of us as well - we could hear them exclaiming about it!    As good as the food was - the service managed to equal it.  I've never had my water refilled so often, the waitress be so knowledgable (we had wine questions), or the bus boys be so efficient.  Amazing, and all without ever feeling like someone was hovering over our table.  Go to the Mesa Grill.  Even if Bobby Flay didn't personally cook our meal, the people there on a daily basis are infinitely qualified!",

The service was impeccable, it got the point where it was borderline creepy how on-point the entire waiting staff was. All I can say is, the nice guy charged with watching my water glass better get a raise ASAP because he redefined the term \"attentive.\"   Due to several factors (okay fine, one factor: Vegas taking more money than expected), I ended up dismissing the many delectable looking meat entrees and ordered the Ancho Chile-Honey Glazed Salmon. And holy mother of food, was it sublime.   On a more minor note, the bread is also a gamechanger. It might not be the gaudiest or most hyped restaurant on The Strip (or Caesers for that matter), but Mesa Grill is a top-notch option for anyone looking for a quality fine dining experience.",

Also tried the peach marg and it was good too.     Apps:  definitely get the queso fundido and for a bigger group, the smoked chicken quesadillas were excellent. The names of the items sounded regular but the quality of the food and ingredients made it very special. The quesadilla had toasted sliced garlic and also avocado that was really good. The romaine salad was dressed with the perfect amount of dressing and the Parmesan crisp was really cool.   We all got different entrees and I got to try a bit from everyone's dish.  My favorite was the salmon dish. It was cooked perfectly and the ancho-chili honey glaze formed a slight crispiness that was also sweet and savory.  It was perfect!  The new york strip was large and also cooked perfectly.  Another unique dish was the halibut. It was crusted in blue corn which gave a slight crunchiness to the outside and the sauce it was sitting on had capers and olives among other goodness that was delicious.  The pork tenderloin was also delicious and the burbon and chili sauces were great to dip in.   Side dishes are quite pricey. For 10 bucks a side, we got mashed potatoes, corn, and spinach.  My favorite of the three is the corn.  It was prepared with sauces that complimented the corn perfectly.   For dessert we split a deep dish banana pie which was amazing.  If you like banana pudding, you cannot go wrong with this dish.   Overall, the quality of the service and food was outstanding.  This restaurant is a lot pricier than I can swallow so I would only come back on a special occasion, otherwise I will go bankrupt.",

I'd recommend setting up reservations before going though as this place gets very crowded quickly.  The house salad came cool and crispy, and had warm freshly made croutons. Wow. I've never had that before on a salad. I could've just eaten a giant bowl of salad for dinner. It was awesome. My first ever review of a salad. Geez.  Dinner: My gal got steak, I had chicken, both were out of this world and the portions were nice and healthy. Not too big, not at all small. If we could've eaten our plates, we would've eaten those too.   Nice drink menu, nice overall experience and was a shining hidden gem in Cesars Palace. Great job by all of the staff we encountered as well as the chefs there. Just a little pricey, but like I said, it was worth every penny.",

For a large party, we had to order duplicate dishes, cuz there wasn't anything on the menu other than two dishes for us to try.  Ended up with soup and salad. Which tasted great.  Main dishes only left us with the tigon of a poblano chilli and a mushroom quesadilla. See? Not much variety.  I guess this is a place for meat lovers, but if you're vegetarian, be weary of trying one or two things only. Cuz that's all they have.",

The queso-cheese sauce is so runny that it forces you to eat with a knife and fork.    The staff were everywhere, and we were told about the special menu three separate times, asked to order a margarita by four different waiters, and offered dessert menus by no less than three waiters.  I can understand wanting to maximize every purchasing opportunity to increase revenue, but it became ridiculous.  We were having a business lunch on a Monday, btw.",

Must-tries: -blue pancake duck appetizer  -white peach margarita -cactus pear margarita -jalapeno bread (which comes in the basket....ASK FOR MORE!) -cojita cheese roasted corn side order (oh my jesus)  Eh, fine but won't make you want to dance on the table: -shrimp tamale -lobster tacos -mashed potatoes -salmon (sauce is way too sweet imo) -pork tenderloin (to be fair, i'm not a huge pork guy but I just wasn't as wowed as others have been with this)  For the entrees, you MUST try: -coffee rubbed filet (i've eaten at over 30 steakhouses and this is my favorite).... -NY steak: always perfectly cooked and incredible sauces -rib eye (I just started crying while typing this)  Service has always been great when I've gone. I don't get why people lower their rating to 2 or 3 stars because their water didn't come fast enough. Get over it people. The food is delicious, the servers are usually busting their tails (you're in Caesar's Palace...that doesn't make you Caesar) and your'e in VEGAS!   Definitely try this place. I can't say enough about it. We've tried maybe 8 other steakhouses in Vegas alone and we're always left wondering why we didn't just go back to Mesa",

From the quesadillas to the tuna steak, all of the flavors were interesting and worked well.  The mango rice on the side of my dish had almost gummy pieces of mango in it, which did not impress me texturally.  My boyfriend wasn't as impressed with the food.  He's not a huge southwestern cooking fan, and Bobby Flay's menu is chock full of southwestern choices.    Some other positives:  I had perhaps the best dirty martini I've ever had and the server was spectacular.  He asked if we wanted dessert but was not pushy in any way when we declined which I love.    Negatives:  I didn't love the atmosphere.  It kind of felt like another cheesy restaurant right in the middle of a hotel.  And the really drunk guy that puked all over his coworkers next to us really put a damper on my evening.",

Located right in the middle of the casino, you can easily walk by this place and think nothing of it.. However the next time you pass through Caesars Palace casino and see this restaurant make sure to give it a second or third glance because you need to try this place out.. For those foodies out there that watch the food network 24 hours a day, like me.  you probably know Bobby Flay and it just happens this is one of his establishments... And Mr. Flay has trained his chefs well, for they can sure put out tasty plates of mouth watering goodness..  Southwestern flavors are what you are going to get here so expect some kick in the spice department and you can't be afraid of some heat as well, as the chefs here know how to wake you up but at the same time make your taste buds beg for more.  Lunch has samples of all the basic lunch entrees you would find at any typical restaurant however the plates here come out as sculptures and have very unique tastes that make you understand why Mr Flay is becoming such a big name..  Prices for lunch are closer to the lower $20.00 range and the restaurant seemed to be well staffed however service was slow.. I have visited this place a few times over the years and service is always friendly but I did have a very slow experience this time..However this is quickly forgotten once the food comes out..    If you like your spicy and need a wake me up with flavors come check out MESA you won't be disappointed.. My visit was without reservation but I think we got lucky for it quickly filled up and there was  line when leaving...",

The food was not all that .... 26 items is mornings compared to what Flay makes on his shows. No one wants to eat a chefs already made can't change menu .... Come on.  If your with friends don't come here, on a date...... Maybe. Once a year or so.  Come on Bobby ! Make some food normal people can eat not this mini sized portion servings ....

But along the way, we called and informed them and the host accepted it as calm as can be.   So getting there about 30 minutes late for our 8:30 dinner reservation, we had to wait about 5 minutes till our party was complete.   Right then and there they led us to our table and offered for drinks on the spot.   Hello tequila!   Yes, they have a great selection and the margaritas are just golden.   Mixed sweet and it's got the kick.   Our waiter introduced himself and informed us about the wine list. He even pointed out some of the specific details of the tequila list and explained some of the items on the menu. The bread basket was good, but I was mostly impressed with the customer service and the interior.   We skipped the appetizer and decided to go for the entree since we had to catch up with our schedule for the club.   I opted for the Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops.   This is where BF's talent in his signature sauces come in.   Simple presentation, just grilled with a side of Tamale and the meat in the center.   The flavors come together and heaven came down to earth.   It was a balance of meatiness, salt, sweet, spice, and a tang of goodness. It looked like I can finish the plate, but wow was I wrong.   That portion was a lot for one person to conquer.   Next time I'll try the seafood.   I'll be back Mesa, I'll make sure to leave my hotel an hour before considering the strip traffic and the parking.   There are three places to valet park and the best one is all the way in the back closest to the restaurant.",

Even the bread basket we started with was delicious, made up of a fresh cornmuffin, a sweet bread with raisins baked inside, and another bread with jalepeno pieces baked in giving it a tiny bite. Dined here with my hubby during our Vegas weddingmoon and we were very pleased. The lobster tacos are fresh and yummy as a starter, comes w/ 3 bite size tacos. The tiger shrimp appetizer is a must. The creamy corn sauce with fresh cilantro goes so well with the shrimp. For an entree I got the pork tenderloin, something I typically wouldn't order but it was highly recommended by a frequent diner. It was the perfect portion size for me. The meat was tender and delicious, complimented by flavors of black pepper and some slightly spicy orange sauce that was awesome. Also got a side of the queso mashed potatoes sprinkled with fresh herbs (maybe chives?)...very creamy and delicious. Only complaint is that I ordered a mixed drink that tasted as if it was made with cheap, bad alcohol. If I'm paying an arm and a leg to wine & dine in Sin City, it's pretty disappointing to be served a poor quality cocktail.",

After a week of eating at high end places, we finished at Mesa Grill, and it was the best meal all week, quite possibly the best service I've ever had at a restaurant.   I left the restaurant angry at my small stomach, cursing it for not being able to accept more of the amazing food. I had a tamale and the pork tenderloin, which was amazingly tender. For dessert I had a chocolate banana dish (forgive me, its been 2 months since we ate there), which was amazing as well.   If I ever own a restaurant I think I'd have to take my employees to this place and tell them \"Here, this is service, be like these people.\" Honestly, the staff was incredible, well trained.   The food was spicy of course, we're average eaters I think, we don't choke down jalapenos on a regular basis, but don't mind heat. The thing is, the food was so incredibly balanced, I think even my parents who don't like heat at all would have probably liked it.  I cannot recommend this place enough. I will be back, every time I'm in Vegas I'm sure.",

Here are some recommedations: Brunch -  *the BEST THING on the brunch menu is their SPICY CHICKEN AND SWEET POTATO HASH with poached eggs.  It's goooie! *MESA BURGER is tasty but nothing extraordinary *BLOODY MARYS are made just right with a little extra kick  Dinner - so many excellent choices *RED AND BLACK PEPPER ENCRUSTED FILET MIGNON cooked perfectly *NEW MEXICAN SPICE RUBBED PORK TENDERLOIN the spiciest thing on the menu, pretty spicy but I couldn't stop eating it. YUM! *GRILLED LAMB PORTERHOUSE CHOP best lamb chops ever and so perfect with cranberry/jalapeno sauce.  Dessert: They don't disappoint.  We had the sampler and all of it was good.

The shrimp tamale was to-die-for and the mojitos were fantastic! Well, I just went with a couple of friends to LV a couple of days ago, and I nonchalantly suggested we eat at Mesa Grill before hitting the clubs. Dinner was fabulous. (The ritas were tasty too!) Most of us had huge filets (like double the usual portion size) that just melted in our mouths. I wasn't impressed with the cornbread (little dry) or my side, a blue corn tamale that was just blue cornmeal, nothing in it, but other than that, it's a great place for a great meal.  Dinner is entree only, sides are separate so it's pricey, but what worth doing/eating doesn't cost a pretty penny in Vegas?  1 drink + filet + 1 side = $85 (inc tax + tip)",

Service was wonderful, food presentation nice, bread basket unique!  Appetizers: \"Rough Cut\" Raw Tuna Nachos - $15 for a rather small portion, but each bite was full of flavor and a looming unexpected, but anticipated, spice. Came with only 6 pieces of nacho chips!   Tiger Shrimp and Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale - $16;  very tasty, bigger portion than expected. I didn't get to eat too much of it.  Entrees: Pork tenderloin - not as spicy as I thought it was going to be, slightly disappointed from that. However, the pork was really tender, and portions were just right. Really good use of vibrant orange sauces.  New york strip steak - this didn't come with anything. The menu didn't mention it'd come with anything..but I guess I just assumed? It was a large plate with a hunk of meat, ontop a drizzle of vibrant sauce. The steak was very good. But...it was just a piece of steak, nothing more.  Dessert: Sampler, which included warm chocolate cake, burnt orange cheesecake, and warm caramel pineapple empanada. All of them were good...but the empanada...I guess I just wasn't a fan. It kinda reminded me of an apple turnover. =(  Overall though, this place was very good. Each plate of food was very solid; explosive flavor, nice sauce. The 7 of us left extremely full.",

It came with ham which was okay.. but I don't really like ham to begin with. It also had two small buttermilk biscuit which was so cute and really one of the best biscuits I tried. I also ordered fries with my meals but it was just potatoes. My friend ordered pear cactus drink which smelled really strong but it wasn't. There was bread basket which came before the food which we practically devoured in minutes. There was blueberry coffee cake, jalapeno bread, and cranberry scones, and something cornbread. The jalapeno bread was our favorite. Nice place to try sometimes. The service is also very good.",

The atmosphere is nice, we went for lunch and it had a somewhat upscale feel to the place- very southwestern. I liked the comfortable dining chairs as well.   The service is where they lose a star! My husband waited far too long for a refill on his soda, I would have loved to order one of their famous margaritas midway through our meal, and would have also liked to have another piece of their delicious asiago bread. I love bread and I can now consider myself a connoisseur after trying so many different types and this asiago bread at Mesa Grill is amazing! We waited a super long time for our entrees, but after our meal he was quick to pick up the payment. Hmph! I tipped generously regardless. It was pretty busy in the restaurant and I think they could have been understaffed, there is a possibility that our poor service wasn't entirely the waiter's fault. The bottom line is that we'll be back on a night when we are feeling patient. We'll be sure to order everything we want straight away in case they get too swamped and are unable to check on us.",

    "text": "Let me first start off by saying that this was one of the places that I was more excited to visit than any other place because I think Bobby Flay is a bad ass.  I like watching food network and I Bobby Flay always tries to bring the heat. bring the flavor.  Bobby Flay, I would be embarrassed to have my name associated with this restaurant.  We were seated to our table, and our waiter came out to speed read us our menu and his recommendations.  I started with a bloody and when my wife stated that water was all she wanted, the waited ignored her and showed her the drink menu, gave more opinions of what he would have etc etc.  When she reiterated that all she wanted was water, he glared, yes folks, glared and walked away.  So our food came out real fast... too fast... As in yeah we had this made already and just warmed it up a touch.  I don't need my food made from scratch each and every time, I just don't want it to taste like it was made days ago and reheated.  So I had the  Mesa burger. Double cheddar cheese. Grilled Vidalia onion. Horseradish mustard.  Asked for medium rare/medium.  got medium well/well.  if you are going to ask me how I want it cooked you should try to adhere to that level of \"cookedness\" ;-)  The burger was lack luster from bun to burger to onion to my mouth.  Nothing about this burger was good aside from the horseradish mustard, which had a nice kick.  If I wanted a mediocre burger I would go to applebee's or something like that.  At least there I would not be let down with a bad tasting burger, I would expect it.  Tiger shrimp and roasted garlic corn tamale is what my wife had.  Oh course I ate some too, sharing is caring.  We agreed that the shrimp was overcooked.  I think that this dish would have been pretty good if the shrimp was not overcooked.  It surely had the potential.  The tamale was great, soft moist flavorful.  No wonder this dish has been on the menu since the opening of the restaurant. So overall this place was a let down.  I was looking for flavor and heat, really did not get any of that here.  I was so rushed through my meal and my waiter was so rude that it made me feel like I was at a fast food restaurant.  It seemed, however just an assumption, that once we declared only one cocktail per our table, hey we drank all day gambling and needed a break, it felt like the waiter saw us as a low profit table, and treated us thus.  Really wanted to like this place. ;-(",

Came here because I love the grill, the Southwest, AND Bobby Flay, although I'd never been to one of his restaurants and I'm a little skeptical of whether celebrity chefs' places can live up to what they do in person.  In any case, we missed lunch on Friday, so came here Saturday.  I was a little bummer that they were only serving brunch (I'm not a breakfast person at ALL, save for my love for bacon).  I got the burger, which was very go and the meat quality was high.  But my girl got the chicken with sweet potato hash and poached eggs.  This was really different, delicious, and had a nice kick.  Flavors were bangin'.  Also the iced tea was good.  Overall I felt like I as paying for Flay's name, which is a little silly.  I mean, $60 for brunch is a little outrageous, but it was good.  WOuld I go back?  Eh, not before going elsewhere, but the food WAS good and the whole things was enjoyable.",

What I got: Tiger shrimp tamale Honey glazed salmon Sixteen spice chicken  The place itself is very nice, obviously you know it's in Cesar's palace. The staff is very friendly and our serve was friendly and very helpful as well. They give you a bread basket when you first sit down and bread has some peppers and jalapenos in it. I personally, didn't really enjoy it. It tasted more like corn bread, which I'm not a fan of. We stared off with the tiger shrimp tamale, it was good, but not great to me. The shrimp and the sauce were very tasty. Then the entrees came out. My dish the sixteen spice chicken was uhhhh-amazing. The chicken was so tender and juicy! I'm drooling just thinking about it now. I love how the mango sauce had a little kick to it. The mash potatoes were also delicious. Honestly, probably one of the best dishes I've ever had to date. The second entree dish the honey glazed salmon, I don't really enjoy salon that much it was pretty darn good. It was crispy on the out and moist and juicy on the inside.   Overall, I would definitely come back! Must try.",

Then I had the coffee rubbed filet w mushrooms-cooked to perfection!  My husband had the NY Strip-he loved it and it was quite a generous size too.  As sides he had the twice baked potato w horseradish & I had the carrots.  We shared both-the carrots were good but probably my least favorite part of the meal but I also wanted to try something different, we both loved the potato.  Excellent anniversary meal!

Of the options we had in Caesars, Mesa Grill sounded like the most unique.  However, it was Sunday brunch time, so I felt like our menu was limited.  We were still able to get the tiger shrimp corn tamale which was amazing, and probably the best thing we had.  That's what got me really excited.  The food came out and looked amazing.  I ordered the spicy chicken sweet potato hash, and my friend got the chilaquiles.  They came with sides of fries and grits, and of course there's the insane bread basket you see in the pictures.    However, after a few minutes of eating all this delicious food, I started to feel that it was really heavy and came to a halt.  I didn't even finish my cactus pear magarita which I was also really excited about.    I'll chalk it up to the time of day and say the food isn't really fit for a brunch, but delicious nonetheless and I probably would have scarfed it all down for a real lunch or dinner.",

I ordered the Roasted Corn Chowder which was offered for a limited time and let me tell you it was out of this world. Next up was their famous Tiger Shrimp Corn Tamale, I almost licked the plate clean.  For our entrees, my wife went with the Chicken & Black Bean Quesadillas. Those were crazy good. I went with their famous Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin, it did not disappoint. Cooked perfect with a spicy BBQ sauce drizzled over it. I've had it before but tonight's was amazing.

They were prompted! Selection of items on the menu were a wide range from tamales to rabbit. I decided to get the Chile Releno. Very delicious. Good job BOBBY FLAY! Dish was prepared very well! The taste and the crisp of the outer shell was great! If you are looking for some Mexican fusion this is the place to be!",

    "text": "Being from Texas and finding a place that does Southwestern food SO right was like a heart melting moment. The taste of tamale in my mouth sends me straight back to my life in Dallas. Yum-my. Nothing better.  Went in and sat at the bar and was waited on by a fabulous bartender named Christine. She's a mixologist of the highest order. You MUST try her drinks, they are fabulous. But be careful, they're potent too! We had the cactus margarita (can't remember the full name) and the white peach. Definitely try both, they were delicious!  For an appetizer me and my girlfriend shared the tiger shrimp with roasted garlic corn tamale. It's supposed to be Flay's best of. I don't doubt it. It was a flavor explosion that really rocked my mouth! Creamy flavors, sweet tamale, large shrimp. You'll regret not trying this.   For our lunch I ordered the smoked shrimp tacos and salsas. My gf ordered the ancho chile-honey glazed salmon. My mouth, personally, was on overload with all this flavor.   The tacos came out with two skewers of three large shrimp, two flour tortillas and three salsas and cabbage slaw that was delicious. The salsas were mango, avocado and one other that I'm not sure of, but trust me, you will eat all three and love them.   The salmon was HUGE. I couldn't believe the difference in size. Mine was two dollars more and half the size. I was crushed. The salmon was flaky and covered in this creama sauce that was to DIE for. I would definitely recommend this for sure.   For dessert we finished it off with the sticky toffee pudding. Wow! Sweet and dense with a really great flavor. Was really impressed. We wanted churros, but they don't serve them at lunch, which we found odd considering that churros are a staple of southwestern cuisine. Anyway, we'll go back for those at dinner soon!",

The food here is fantastic. The portions are large, and it's reasonably priced for Vegas standards.   We came here on a Saturday night after a show, and even at 9:30 PM, our reservation saved us a pretty long wait. Started with the tiger shrimp and had the lamb porterhouse chops for the main event. The wife got pork tenderloin and loved it even though she hardly ever orders meat. The lamb was also very tasty with a serrano sauce that gave it a kick that one would expect from Bobby Flay.   Overall a great meal in a great atmosphere for a good price. There a lot of options for famous chefs' restaurants in Vegas, but Bobby Flay has got a great thing going at Mesa, and for my money, it's well worth the trip and a must try.",

The bread basket had variety with cornbread and jalapeno bread.  Quality was OK.  The 13 spice chicken was well presented.  The outside had a good flavor, but the chicken inside was dry though.  The accompanying mashed potatoes had a nice creamy texture, but nothing out of this world.  The ahi tuna was a large chunk of tuna.  They drenched the exterior with sauce. However, once you dig in, the middle just tasted like raw tuna, and lacked any flavors.  The cous cous was okay.  Service was alright.  I remember my first experience where everyone would greet you when you walk in.... Now no one hardly greets you.  Overall, just an okay experience.",

I guess they are known for margaritas ($17), so I figured I would try one of those, I had them make it with Mezcal instead of tequila and it was really good (and strong).    They give you a bread basket with a few different types of bread in it, all of them were good, but the best was this little muffin with blue cornmeal in it.  I could have ate about a dozen of those alone.    For an entree I had the 16 spice chicken, it came pretty much deboned, minus one of the wings, over some mashed potatoes.  The dinner version of this was $36, but I would still say it was worth it. Not a place you are going to go eat at all the time, but if you are in town it's worth your time.  Sometimes these celebrity chef restaurants end up being a disappointment, but this place lived up to its repuation.",

Tasty, tasty items on the menu but my buddy and I went with our server's recommendation of the Burgers (Sorry I forget their names but there were 2 different ones and we got both)  All I can say negatively about this place that removes a star is the price.  Now before you scream, \"Man, it is Vegas!! Everything is expensive!\", hear me out.  I expect a mark up on items in Vegas, I do.  I also expect a mark up when a restaurant has a celebrity chef attached to it such as Bobby Flay to Mesa even though he doesn't step a foot in the building.  That being said, the burgers were already $18 which is FAR too much for a burger, but then the server asked if I wanted bacon (who wouldn't) and then brought out 2 slices of thin Hormell like bacon to me..which ended up being $4 on the bill.  Ok...there is expensive, and there is a $2 slice..SLICE of bacon.  If it was a thick, pork belly style of bacon or something..then I can understand...but this was legit what you get at a breakfast diner.  So I left with a slightly bad taste in my mouth after the bill...but overall it was a delicious and pleasurable meal.",

It was delicious, yes, but for the cost I could have made about 15 of them myself and the would have been comparably delicious and had not shrimp on them.  I also thought the sauce was a bit salty.   I then had the chicken hash.  Very important note, it was all very Mushy. Not like how I expected with bits of crispy chicken and potato with crispy corners, NO.  Mush.  Texturally a big mistake Bobby.   I didn't dig the hollandaise on it either.   I left unfortunately wishing I had just gone elsewhere in Caesars instead.

The bar was busy with a few seats open, just not 3 together. We asked the host if we could sit at a lounge table and he said yes, but we would need to order at the bar. Fine, no big deal right?   For ten minutes we looked for the elusive bartender. We finally asked the host if he could locate her. He brought us menus and went off to find her. We sat at the bar lounge table (directly across from bar) and made our selections. Two of us walked up to the bar to order and the bartender refused to serve us because we were sitting at a table not the bar.   It got uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. She basically argued with the host. The one who told us we were fine in the first place. Several people offered to switch stools to accommodate the 3 of us. What never happened was an apology. Nothing was said by the beyond rude female bartender nor the host as we walked out stating we didn't feel welcome.   It is also interesting to note people were sitting at restaurant tables at this point.   Never have I ever experienced anything like this. In a town like Vegas, where options are literally EVERYWHERE, this should be a sign to go anywhere but here.",

My boyfriend had the chicken dish with garlic mashed potatoes which was perfectly cooked as well. We ordered a few appetizers which came out quickly, and ended up being PLENTY to share between the 4 of us. What really stood out though, was the excellent customer service. We walked in with our t-shirts and shorts, looking haggard from a long day, but we were treated like we were dressed to the nines. Our server, Tina M, was delightful and extremely helpful. When we wanted to know what was in the ricotta cheese dish, she went above and beyond by bringing us the ingredient list, highlighting exactly what we were looking for. Overall, this was the best place we ate in Vegas, and will definitely be coming back on our next trip.",

    "text": "The place is my favorite restaurant, but unfortunately deserves a 4. As a place that runs the pocket well into fine dining, it doesn't merit any additional stars. While the design of the restaurant is elegant, the narrow spacing between tables really destroys the decor and feel of the restaurant. Standing only 5'9\" I was already feeling cramped at their two person tables.   Mesa has the best appetizer of any restaurant I've been to (shy of Picasso). The appetizers on the menu are why I keep coming back. While their steak was lackluster, the Veal and Pork options on the menu are the stars on their entree menu. The seafood, while excellent, do not deserve to stand in the same light as the earlier entree options. Dessert has always been a hit or miss for the location as many of them are seasonal; if you ever cross the pound cake with a peach compote, I highly suggest you get it. As for alcohol, the place is very heavy handed (I am a lightweight though).  Service is abruptly standard fare; while I have not had any problems, there have been no spectacularly amazing incidents either.  While they are among the cheaper fine dining options in Las Vegas, their Mexican fusion is one of my favorites regardless of their flaws.",

Not a good start Bobby.   Ok now about the service and food. My salad was ok. Chicken was ice cold and very dry. Nothing to write home about. Others seem to enjoy the food at our table however the initial contact with the hostess set the tone. Won't be back. Do not waste your money here. Head over to Gordon Ramsey's place.

Yes, their complimentary bread was that good - the cornbread, the scones... everything in that basket - and they give free refills.  The waitress was sweet and friendly. For brunch, she recommended the raw tuna nachos (aka tuna tartar) dish which was delicious, though a bit pricey. Their sea bass was good, but my favorite was the spicy chicken and sweet potato hash. It was like an eggs benedict, minus the muffin, plus spicy chicken and hash. It's nothing you'd find at your typical Mexican breakfast joint.  JONASAPPROVED!",

Boo. My hubby and I were disappointed that we couldn't have the full dining experience, since we ate at the bar.  I love the appetizer breads. My favorite is the corn muffin. Yum! Since we didn't have breakfast, I was practically full from eating bread.   I had the Grilled Mahi Mahi with the roasted pineapple chile sauce, carmelized pineapple - green onion salsa and green chile rice ($24). The mahi mahi was overcooked, so I didn't like the dish too much. In addition, the fish wasn't that large. Way overpriced for lunch. At least the sauces were good.   My hubby ordered the Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash with the poached egg and green chile hollaindaise ($18). Yum! This is a very savory dish due to the sweet potato hash. There is some spice to the chicken. I love the presentation of this dish. The texture is a bit mushy due to the shredded chicken and sweet potato. It is like eating baby food. However, the dish is tasty!   I would try this place again for dinner. Hopefully the portions are larger at dinner.",

The decor is nice and modern and very comfortable. We even had a table between to other couples and did not feel at all intruded upon. For drinks, we could not resist Bobby's margarita selection, which has it's own menu. I had the Cactus Pear, the lady had the Peach. Mine was good, but the peach was way better. I switched for my 2nd drink!  I started with the Corn soup as an app which was fantastic. For entrees, I had the grilled lamb porterhouse chops served in a tangerine roasted jalapeno mint sauce. Served with a plantain tamale with molasses butter. The fiancee had the blue corn crusted halibut with salsa cruda, served with sweet 100 tomatoes, capers, Nicoise olives, basil & oregano. Both dishes were as delicious as they sound, cooked to perfection, and served not a minute too soon. My chops were cooked to a perfect medium, bursting with a juicy deliciousness that was both expected and unexpected all at the same time. A+. Her halibut was equally as good, many notes of incredible flavor all on one plate. Bobby's the man!  Portions were adequate, good enough for us to skip dessert and feel perfectly full. I'm glad we finally took the opportunity to go here, and look forward to our return!!",

But a was a little worried that Mesa Grill could be one of those \"just marketing\" or \"just name\" kind of restaurants, as Bobby Flay owns this. That was not the case.  Mesa Grill delivers the goods. Located in Ceasar's Palace, it does look a little unassuming from the outside, but once you go inside, you get the full perspective, sections and layers of levels make the most of the somewhat limited space. I strongly suggest you make reservations first.  The service is quite good, with a very knowledgeable waiter, who knows the menu by heart and can guide you and help you make the right decision.   We started off with the Yucatan Chicken Tacos, the rough cut Tuna Nachos, the Tiger Shrimp with the Roasted Corn Tamale, and a Crab Cake. They were all good, but the Tuna Nachos and the Tiger Shrimp were just superb.  Our waiter told us that there are two dishes that made this restaurant famous, the Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin and the Coffee Rubbed Filet Mignon. My friends ordered the Black Angus New York Strip Steak and I ordered the Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin. My dish has to be one of the top 10 dishes I've had, period. You would not believe this was pork if they didn't tell you, it was tender and juicy, cooked just right.  We ate so much that we couldn't finish our dishes even though we tried to.  I must say, that this place is on the pricier side, but this is Vegas, and this was a memorable meal.  Make Mesa Grill a stop on your next Vegas trip.",

    "text": "I have to say, we were a tad disappointed with our Saturday brunch at Mesa Grill -- and we really didn't want to be.  The host staff was able to get us in without a reservation within 15 minutes -- so kudos to them, even tho' Caesars' was rocking with the Saints - Cards playoff game.  We were seated & greeted by our waiter in a timely manner, who did a nice job, overall.  He gave us the time to peruse the brunch menu & ask a few questions -- he, too, made a few suggestions -- the Mesa Grill margarita & Mesa Grill burger.  Hubby ordered a MG margarita (Loved it!) -- I stuck with water for brunch.  Then service slowed down,  I guess the kitchen was backed up, and our waiter was relatively attentive (until \"bill\" time -- when they all seem to disappear).  We ordered the Tenderloin Tartar for an appetizer -- great flavors -- capers & a nice amount of acid with a creamy caper aoili on top, with grilled bread as a side.  Nice flavors -- hit the spot -- set a high standard.  We also received the typical breadbasket with some hits & some misses -- the blue corn muffins were so dry they were almost inedible, but the blueberry crumble bar was divine & the little corn muffins with fresh jalapenos were delicious.  The cranberry & fruit/nuts muffin was ok.  Our entrees, however, were not up to par.  Hubby got the MG Burger, ordered medium with a pink center.  Flavors were good, bread was nice, tomatoes were fresh; but, even though the burger was pink in the middle, it was incredibly dry -- almost inedible.  Not sure why?  Pulled off grill to sit & wait during the rush?  I ordered the spicy chicken with sweet potato hash w/ poached eggs and green chile hollandaise.  The eggs & hollandaise were great -- would order again if I could have them on some other starch.  The chicken-sweet potato hash was incredibly sweet -- not enough savory or heat to offset the sweetness.  It was way, way beyond the average sweetness of a baked sweet potato -- not sure what was added to make it so sweet.  I ended up eating the eggs, etc. off of the hash & leaving the rest.  Then, it was time to leave -- and our ever-attentive waiter disappeared.  We ended up doing the \"leave the credit card on the table\" trick to get his attention, so we didn't even look at the bill before he took our credit card -- but, we were just happy to have him swipe the card & get going.  The Tendeloin tartar was all Chef Flay can be, but the signature MG Burger was so far short of our expectations and. I'm sure, of Chef Flay's expectations, that I would have to believe the burger was a fluke.  The chicken-sweet potato hash needs reworking as far as I'm concerned.  Not enough heat or flavor profile to offset the sweet.    Go back?  Probably not -- Las Vegas has enough other wonderful restaurants that I'm not inclined to start repeating until we've gone through most of the other ones.  It's a shame -- I do like Chef Flay's cooking, even though I like to joke about the plethora of chipotles.  Chef Flay -- please look into these comments -- I realize you have restaurants all over the country -- but when your line cooks can't get your signature burger right -- you have to wonder.  I truly hate to give you 3 stars, I had hoped it would be an out-of-the-ballpark 5 star brunch; but with high expectations and the high standards that I'm sure you set for your kitchen staff, I was more than slightly disappointed in the quality and character of the food we received.",

Almost all the dishes I had here were drawn with sauces, I think the sauce should enhance the dish not over powering it. The only dish I would recommend is the Spicy Chicken+ Sweet Potato Hash on their brunch menu@ $16.50(with Avocado, Tomato, Maytag Blue Cheese + Buttermilk Serrano Dressing), the dish was very nicely presented and was also hearty and filling. The other good thing here is their complimentary mini blue corn breads.  I sincerely feel that the chefs at this location should step up to the plate, and really refine their dishes and cooking skills, inorder to meet the standard of the one in NYC.",

The absolute only reason I have taken one star away is because of their reservation policy. They make it so, if you miss your reservation, you must pay $50 a person, however, when we showed up for our reservation at 8:45pm we were not seated until nearly 9pm. I understand that people are busy, but I wonder if they would afford us the same courtesy towards our reservation if we had been late?",

    "text": "This place is Bobby Flay which btw is one of my favorite chef's.  For a white cat he definitely has a great sense in the mastering of southwest cooking.  Definitely stop by this place if you are in Vegas and want a moderately priced place that will produce great food.    I have eaten here for years and have to admit it never gets old. The appetizers, you have to try the queso fundido which is one of many you can enjoy.  Maybe the chorizo meatballs to complement the cheese with a nice wine pairing.   Dinner here is always a new dish for me the last I tried was the Mango Spiced Tuna which was pretty amazing, I need to find this recipe and impress on the next home dinning experience.  Note to self, Bobby loves spice so if you notice most of the items on the menu will have a kick.  MY ALL TIME FAVORITE drum roll please..... definitely has to be the porterhouse chops, one of the best dishes in vegas.    Deserts are probably the only area that leave you a bit sad after the great dishes you have experienced before a night out.  Definitely leaves you wondering why Bobby why?",

I admire Bobby Flay and I have had some of the dishes he inspired and like what he does with flavors.  I figured Mesa would be a safe bet when I was asked to choose the place for a group of six.  It was better than safe, it was excellent.  The service was excellent.  The gruop wasn't in a rush, and the waitress didn't rush us.  She spent a lot of time asnwering questions without a hit of annoyance.    I had the coffee rubbed Filet Mignon and it is probabyl the best steak I have ever had.  I didn't need a steak knife, it fell apart.  There was something about the coffee rub that is going to compell me to go through hsi cookbooks in hopes I find what exactly is in it.  Other notable items on the table were Goat Cheese Queso Fundido, heirloom tomato salad.  Both were excellent.  The side of mashed potatoes was really good.    This is a top notch restaurant!",

The dish... well, it was two mounds of mushy, mashed up sweet potato with tiny cubes of chicken mixed into it, topped with two poached eggs, and completely drenched in hollandaise sauce. In my mind, you can never go wrong with a dish with poached eggs. Well, they've proved me wrong. This dish had no texture, and no bold flavors at all. Well, other than the sweetness emanating from the mounds of sweet potato. I'm usually a huge fan of sweet potato, but it was just way too much that it completely overpowers anything else on the plate. I did not taste any hint of spiciness at all. I felt like I was just eating a plate of sweet potato puree, which felt kinda sickening after a while. Needless to say, I did not finish the dish.  The one redeeming factor: the bread basket. The jalapeno bread was yummy. I'll give them that.  Another minus: the waiter felt the need to explain to me what a poached egg was after I placed my order. Really?",

We went on a Saturday night which of course was busy but I think this place is most likely busy on all nights.  We were able to obtain a reservation for 9:30PM.    I thought it would be slow by then.  Wow.  The place was still packed and they quit serving around 11PM.    Everything was delightful.  Nice and warm with the Southwest flair.  We were excited about the prospect of ordering dessert as well, however, the appetizers and the meal filled us up so perhaps next time we will order dessert first.  :)  It was an enjoyable time.

Our server knew the menu well and had recommendations, the service was very good.  We both had the Mesa burger and fries. The burger itself was cooked perfectly. I did not care for the horseradish mustard that it came with, it was overly spicy. The burger was very large and a little awkward to eat. Even cut in half it was hard to bite into it without everything falling out. It was an average burger. I did not care for the fries at all. They had  a spicy little kick to them which I really enjoyed, but the fries were very crispy, not soft at all. I only had a few of them, it was more like eating potato chips.  Overall the service was good, but the food was nothing special. Being a big fan of Bobby Flay's I've heard him speak of this restaurant many times so I was excited to go there, but I won't be back.",

    "text": "After wandering around Caesar's Palace for a while trying to find Mesa Grill, I asked an employee, who sent me in the opposite direction of the restaurant.  Then I asked another employee, who had me turn right, when it should have been left.  The THIRD employee finally gave me accurate directions.  And, of course, this meant a lot of walking through the smoke-filled (cough, hack, wheeze) casino.  Ugh!  (Pro tip: If you want to get to Mesa Grill without inhaling too much cigarette smoke, enter Caesar's Palace from the front rather than the parking garage in the back.)  Fortunately, once we found the place, the hostess helpfully seated us as far away as she could from the smoke of the casino.  Our waiter was also very helpful.  My wife has a low tolerance for spicy heat, and he was able to help her find an entree that wouldn't be to spicy for her, the Blue Corn Crusted Halibut, but leaving out the jalepenos that are normally part of the dish.  When she tried to order the Plantain Tamale as a side dish, he sadly shook his head and said \"You don't want that.\"  (It sounds rude written out like that, but it really wasn't.)  At first, we thought he was joking, but then he explained that it was too dry.  He recommended a corn-based side dish instead, which she was very happy with.    I, on the other hand, was looking for some spice, and was very happy with the New Mexican Pork Tenderloin, with an Anaheim Chile Relleno on the side.  The pork tenderloin also came with a sweet potato tamale that my wife gleefully stole.  An unexpected benefit of where we were seated was a good view of the kitchen.  We particularly enjoyed watching the woman in charge of keeping the steady stream of dishes from different orders organized.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I went to Las Vegas last weekend for her birthday. As soon as we got to our room in the Monte Carlo, we naturally began searching Yelp for nearby restaurants. When we found out that one of our favorite Food Network Chefs, Bobby Flay, had a restaurant at Caesar's Palace, it instantly shot to the top of our list.   We went to Mesa Grill for our last night, after going to Wolfgang Puck's, Lupo and Emeril Lagasse's Table Ten the nights before. The location was very convenient since Caesar's Palace is in the middle of the strip and the restaurant itself was absolutely gorgeous, very clean and modern. Everything you could possibly want for a classy Las Vegas experience.   Personally I still had some doubts because Tex Mex is not my girlfriend's or my favorite type of cuisine, we never seek it out, but I would say I don't have much knowledge about it either. I didn't find the whole idea of Tex Mex too appealing.  I started getting even more concerned when I found the wait staff to be a little pretentious and more than a little snooty. Our main waiter in particular made me feel like we didn't belong since we're a young couple blowing all our money on this short getaway and not some rich established older people who can really afford to got to a place like this without worrying about making rent. Anyway he seemed rather annoyed at our amateur etiquette overall ignorance regarding such extravagance. But I think we won him over with our charm by the end.  The man who took our cocktail orders was by far the best, giving us all kinds of knowledge about the menu, making friendly conversation, sharing his personal preferences and just really making time to stop by a few times just so see how our drink experience specifically was going. The drinks were absolutely delicious.  Be excited about some pretty good free bread to help prepare you for the journey ahead. The bread grew on me as I ate more, but it was nothing to  We actually tried to save money by getting two appetizers, the Tiger Shrimp Tamale and Blue Corn Pancake, and only getting one entree, the Chile Relleno (one of my favorite dishes in life that was conveniently the most inexpensive entree on the menu). But when we tasted the appetizers, we instantly ordered another Entree, the Pork Tenderloin. The Tiger Shrimp Tamale especially was like tasting heaven. It the shrimp was zesty and bold pairing perfectly with the creamy garlic sauce. The texture of the tamale was very pleasing and the consistency  was tender, but still substantial. The Blue Corn Pancake was also delicious, the flavor was more simple, the duck was very juicy and was smothered in a succulent dark, deep, rich, velvety sauce. It was very aromatic, just a truly seductive dish.  The Chile Relleno had the most stunning presentation in my opinion. The cornmeal crust is that perfect amount of golden crisp, not oily. It's satisfying cracking it open like Creme Brulee and unleashing the cheezy melty, spicy explosion within. There are so many textural layers that make the experience of eating it so dynamic and just adds to the diversity of flavor. I've never had anything like it; by far one of the best dishes I've ever tasted in my entire life. It was like eating art.  The Pork Tenderloin was also breathtaking to look at, and my girlfriend would say it was the prettiest presentation, but we would both agree it was the best dish of the whole meal. I never knew that meat could be prepared in such a way where every nuance, every single note of flavor possible to achieve in the universe can sing in harmony together so immaculately. Every single flavor that has ever excited my taste buds came flooding back and brought back friends I never knew existed and we danced, danced, danced! Pure ecstasy. After that is kind of a blur. All I know is that I had eaten the best thing I have ever tasted.  And that wasn't even the end. We were so drunk on the pleasures of food and drink that we ordered dessert, the Toasted Coconut Layer Cake. The coconut shone throughout the dish, the cake was incredibly moist, the icing was soft and delicate and the Creme Anglaise just took the cake to another level of decadence.   Overall the meal was one of the best in my whole life. The experience was also one of the best in my entire life, but I wouldn't call the restaurant experience perfect because of the service. In general Las Vegas service lacks in attitude. They do all the right things technically, but their attitude, personality, and what they say always leaves a lot to be desired. There's is rarely genuine friendly service and this restaurant, sadly was no exception in that area. But I still give the restaurant five stars for just being so breathtakingly delicious, the restaurant's atmosphere was beautiful and clean, and the service was still professional, fast and insanely efficient (when we ordered another entree, they still came out at the same time only minutes after we told them). Yes, go here! The end.",

    "text": "Spring Restaurant Week 2013:  Day 5:   Mesa Grill is known for a handful of dishes and usually Restaurant Week tends to be the showcase for their best items. I have eaten here a few times in the past couple of years. Each time I have had a great experience. The must try items are the tiger shrimp tamale, the rough cut tuna nachos, crab cakes, spicy chicken sweet potato hash, the chile rellenos, and their desserts.  There is a reason why Mesa wins every year when it comes to the most money raised for our local food bank. They put out a well balanced menu that gives the guest the biggest bang for their buck. The portion sizes are scaled back, but leaves you feeling full. I started with the rough cut tuna nachos for my appetizer. It is served like tuna poki. The fish is sashimi grade and served raw. Tosses with chipotle puree, cilantro, capers, and placed on top of a mango habanero puree and avocado crema. The blue corn and tortilla chips are the only utensils you need to scoop up all of this deliciousness.   I got the crab cakes last year when they ran this special which lead me to order the green chile burger this time around. The meat tends to lose it's form and crumbles easily. I ended up using a fork and knife halfway through. The bechamel cheese sauce is delicious. Paired with the pickled onions and pablano peppers gave it a range of depth. If given the choice again, I would have gone with the crab cakes.   The desserts changes ever day depending on what the chef chooses. We got the deep dish banana cream pie. The Frangelico cream only gives hints of the alcohol. The surprise comes from the contrast in textures. The dense custard differs from the soft cream which compliments the bananas and praline disk on top. I am a huge fan of Bobby Flay's desserts. The sticky toffee pudding is not a traditional version, but it is so good. I also like the strawberry shortcake. Pastry changes their offerings seasonally, so keep an eye out for these dishes.",

    "text": "This was our second visit to Mesa Grill over the years ,and it didn't disappoint. Service is great. Had reservation and didn't have to wait long to be seated. Our server Michael P was very nice and courteous. Their Margaritas are great, strong and not overly sweet. Their bread basket is awesome , warm and fresh corn muffins, Asiago bread , all delicious! My husband had the sweet potato clam chowder , this was surprisingly one of the best dishes we tried, smoky, spicy , not as sweet as you might expect from the sweet potato. My only complain with the soup is that It wasn't as warm as I like, and the portion was tiny :(, but really good, left us wishing for more. The shrimp corn tamale is delicious and so was the Mahi Mahi with spicy risotto. My son ordered the langostinos, and these were perfectly cooked and gigantic! Our daughter had Sophie's chopped salad, and she enjoyed it very much! Since we were in a celebratory mood we let the kids choose some desserts: chocolate cake, coconut cake and cheesecake, they were all really good but my favorite was the cheesecake.",

    "text": "This place is a family favorite for us, especially for brunch! We have tried pretty much everything on the menu with few disappointments. Prices are very reasonable for being on the strip. Cactus pear iced tea is a must; I probably go through a whole pitcher :P  For shared appetizer we like the rough cut tuna nachos (basically a poke), queso fundido, and for something different the smoked salmon quesadilla.  Bread basket is a treat with both sweet and savory muffins, scones, biscuits, and bread. For entrees we usually stick to hot dishes - spicy chicken sweet potato hash, chilequiles, salmon. Grits and the bacon are favorite sides. I'd say skip the tenderloin sandwich (cold deli style), and the salads unless that's what you are in the mood for. Steak and eggs is a make your own taco dish which is huge, more than enough for one person. Salmon is another great treat! Also note that you can only get the churros at dinner time for dessert.",

    "text": "We went here a couple of days ago for our 11th anniversary. We had planned to go last year for our anniversary but had to cancel as my wife was found out she had to have surgery and wasn't supposed to eat red meat in the meantime. Now that she's all better, we decided to give it a try this year.  I ordered a Mesa margarita, and my wife ordered a prickly pear margarita. Both were very good. I liked the taste of mine a little better, but the prickly pear was prettier. It had a pretty magenta color.  While we were waiting for our appetizer, we were given a bread basket with three types of bread: corn bread muffin, jalapeno bread, and a nut bread. They were all very good. The corn bread was half regular corn and half blue corn which gave it an appealing appearance. My favorite was the jalapeno bread. It had a nice consistent flavoring of jalapeno without being overwhelming.  For appetizer we split the tiger shrimp tamale. The shrimp was perfectly cooked. It was like a deconstructed tamale. The shrimp was laid on top of the cornmeal. The sauce was very flavorful, and the dish was well-balanced.  For our entrees we had the pork tenderloin and the veal chop. The pork tenderloin was perfectly cooked and tender. The sauce wasn't quite as flavorful as I had hoped for, but it was still delicious.  The veal chop was also perfectly cooked and tender. The seasoning was spot on.  Both entrees were served with a cornmeal tamale thingy that was presented like a baked potato. It was very good and was an interesting presentation.   For our side, we split the Brussels sprouts with pomegranate seeds and pecans. It was an interesting mix of flavors and colors. I never would have thought of combining Brussels sprouts and pomegranate seeds, but it definitely worked.  We took half of our meals to go and were too stuffed to order dessert, though there were definitely some appealing selections on the dessert menu. Maybe next time.  While we were waiting for our entree my wife asked if there was a celebrity behind her. I thought that was an odd question and asked her why she asked. We were sitting near the kitchen and she said all of the kitchen workers were looking at someone behind her. I glanced over and saw Tyra Banks sitting a few tables over. Apparently she was at Caesar's for Celine Dion's rehearsal show as we later saw her in line to get into the show.  The service was a little slow, and even though we got there before the evening rush, we had a lengthy wait between our appetizer and our main course. Because of this, I'd give Mesa 4.5 stars. As we can't pick half stars, I'm gonna round-up and pick 5 stars.",

We went for lunch on our last day and I tried the 3 course $29 pre-fixe menu.  The appetizer was Blue Corn Pancake with Duck. Wow, this was fabulous!  The spices were right on and the texture was perfect.  Unfortunately, the rest of the meal wasn't as great. My entree was the Pork Tenderloin Sandwich.  The waiter mentioned that it came cold and I was fine with that.  But I wasn't fine with how tough the meet was.  I could barely chew it.  The dessert of the day was panna cotta.  I liked the flavor but it wasn't the best dessert I've ever had.  Some of the other people in my party ordered burgers that looked juicy and delicious.  Other than the burgers, all of the other entrees were failures.",

The food is consistently good and the service is great.  The servers are professionals and super knowledgeable.  I like the open kitchen where you get see them grilling your meat!  I like to get a specialty cocktail before the meal and have a glass of wine with dinner.  I got the strawberry fields this time.  It was good, but I think I will stick to the peach margarita.   We always start with the shrimp and corn tamales.  I feel like that is the must have dish on the menu.  It's so good. I asked the server to pick out a glass of white wine for me and he picked exactly what I was looking for.   For my entree this time I had the lamb.  It was tasty and cooked nicely.  The portion size is pretty much double than what I could eat.  I took the other piece of lamb home and actually ate it a few hours later!    I had the squash blossoms as a side which i think i might have let sit on the table too long before eating.   Dessert was ok...Churros with dark chocolate dipping sauce for dessert.",

We ordered appetizers and cocktails which was all delicious. We ordered the Queso Fundido, good but nothing to write home about, the Tiger Prawn Tamales, A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!, and the Rough Cut Tuna Nachos. I love anything with tuna so I was blown away by these! For drinks we each ordered different margaritas, which were all delicious and well mixed.  I think that over-all the prices are pretty steep but we are talking about Vegas here. A lot of things in that town are over-priced but it's more about the experience that you're getting. Our waitress was lovely and patient even though she probably knew that we were not big spenders considering we all look under 21... she even recommended some stuff for us to check out while we were in town and answered our questions about Bobby Flay. I loved every moment of being there because it totally jived with the personality Bobby Flay projects in all of his shows. He seems like a cool and relaxed guy and that still comes through in his over-hyped restaurant. All of the wait staff is friendly and welcoming and it never felt stuffy or pretentious. But next time I'll go back with my parent's so I can experience more of that yummy menu!",

It was one of the best tamale I've ever had, and the sauce was just fantastic.  I've seen Bobby make tamale on Iron Chef dozen of times and finally had the chance to taste it myself.  Now I see why the judges always go \"wow\" when they eat the tamale.  For entree, I had the bone in chipotle glazed rib-eye, medium rare.  It was cooked perfectly to medium rare THROUGH OUT the whole steak.  There are so many steakhouses that can't cook bone in steaks right.  I am never a fan of steaks with sauces, but the red & green chile sauce was really good.  I also got to taste my fiancee's NY strip steak which was done perfectly as well.  The service was great, the waiter was attentive, and the sommelier was willing to waive the corkage since we bought another bottle of wine there.  Overall a must if you love steaks.",

    "text": "Mr. Flay, you are a culinary genius my friend.  There are really four simple rules to dining at Mesa Grill. The first is quite obvious.  Make reservations. Next up, order yourself a wild mushroom quesadilla with white bean hummus and white truffle oil. It can be shared, but be selfish about it and get your own.  It's that good!  Next rule.  When ordering your entree, look only at the cornmeal crusted chile relleno.  For the fourth and final rule, order yourself the mashed potatoes with green chile queso sauce.  I've got no clue how Mr. Flay does what he does so well, but that man knows what he's doing.  Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable and knew what she was talking about when it came time to answering questions about the menu.  A wonderful dining experience.  We'll be sure to go back on our next trip to Sin City.",

    "text": "I was a bit wary of eating in a celebrity chef's restaurant... the tourist trap aspect, etc. Not here... We were blown away from start to finish. Great ambiance, impeccable service, knowledgeable staff, perfectly cooked food, amazingly complex and delicious sauces... and quite possibly the best margarita I have ever tasted (and believe me I have tasted quite a few!!) -- their signature Cactus Prickly Pear Margarita... I'm drooling on my desk just typing about it.  We showed up on a Sunday night a few minutes early for our reservation and were seated immediately by the stunningly gorgeous hostess. Our server's name was Brian and he was very helpful and attentive without being obtrusive. The bread basket had three different and equally amazing temptations -- an asiago sourdough, a wheat bread with raisins and walnuts, and a marbled corn muffin made from yellow and blue corn meal, with bits of infused pepper, and a great little ramekin of delicious butter formed into a perfect little cylinder. The margaritas came out, delivered by another server, a drink runner I suppose. My buddy ordered a regular margarita and I tried their signature drink, the cactus prickly pear margarita. We were both stunned at how delicious the drinks were. I've had hundreds of margaritas all over the country, and I can't think of another that tasted as good... Margaritas are all about proper proportions of ingredients, and these were spot on. I can only surmise that fresh squeezed juices and masterful mixing knocked these out of the ballpark for us.  Our starters came out -- I ordered the grilled asparagus salad with toasted pecans, maytag blue cheese, roasted wild mushrooms + red chile-mustard vinaigrette. Perhaps the weakest link of the food we ordered, but still very good. My buddy had the crispy squash blossoms with ricotta, corn, sweet and hot yellow pepper sauce. This was the bomb and I was kinda jealous though I did manage to steal a few bites. Portion sizes were good, fairly generous, and the presentations were nice. Go squeeze bottle!  Next came the entrees. I got the New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin with bourbon ancho chile sauce and sweet potato tamale with crushed pecan butter. This plate really knocked my socks off... so tasty, so delicate, so beautifully and creatively presented. And quite a generous portion of perfectly cooked tenderloin. The sauces were complex -- a perfect balance of sweet, salty and spicy. I'm not a huge sweet potato fan, but the tamale, topped with the savory, nutty butter was so delicious. My buddy had the 22oz bone-in chipotle glazed rib-eye with red and green chile sauce. He ordered it medium rare and charred, and it arrived at the table exactly as ordered. It's huge! It reminded us of the steak that tipped over Fred Flinstone's car. I tried a couple of bites and it was amazing. I'm not one who usually eats the gooshy fatty parts, but the charring give it a very pleasant melt-in-my-mouth texture that made me rethink that tendency. For us, both entrees were home runs, knocked out of the ballpark. We also split a chile relleno, which I believe was filled with white cheddar. It was great.  We were absolutely stuffed and though curious about their desserts, decided to pass. This was a memorable and exciting culinary experience for us both, and I absolutely have new respect for Chef Flay. To the servers and cooks who made this meal so perfect and memorable, I salute you! I'll be back the next time I'm in Vegas, for sure. Keep up the good work!",

    "text": "Good: 5 Stars, the most amazing meal I've had in ages - thought Bobby Flay's restaurant would just trade on his celebrity status, but really the food was phenomenal. Also reasonably priced for the quality of the food:  Bad: Service - we had a waitress who just wanted to chat it seemed like. I don't know why, but it seems as if she spent half the time just standing over us and talking about Los Angeles, what we did, etc...   Ugly: Our group tipped $50 on a $300 meal (which is just north of 15% which we thought was generous considering the service and the non-stop chatting) as we were getting up to leave she says to us \"did you mean to only tip $50?\"   Normally the last encounter with the waitress would have ruined the evening for us, but the food was just that good!!!",

    "text": "Mesa Grill has an upbeat, modern vibe to it. Lots of glass, light woods, and metal. The bar is off to the side as you enter and has a warm and inviting look about it. Of course you have Bobby Flay swag for sale right in your face as you approach the hostess stand. I get why it's there, but it upped the tacky level more than I'd usually like (even in Vegas). There were a fair number of people waiting, but we had reservations (party of 7) and our wait was less than 10 minutes.  Our server was fairly prompt to the table to take appetizer orders, but I had to tell him we needed a drink menu and the wine list first (sorry, this is something that should be noticed by a server). The wine list was decent, but nothing exceptional. Prices ranged from 2.0x - 3.0x retail. We opted to do two bottles: one was a Joel Gott Zinfandel and the other was a central coast Syrah that carries the restaurant's private label. Both were about $60 each. The Zin was lovely, with a deep color, soft tannins, and all the mouthfeel you'd expect from a nice zinfandel. The syrah had nice flavor, but was a tad tight on its own. I figured it would shine with some of the meat dishes and it did pair very well with the entrees.  Noise levels in the dining area were pretty loud, but it was also a Friday night in Vegas and the place was busy. As for the service after we ordered, well it can be summed up with one word: s-l-o-w. Our apps took a while to appear and the entrees took even longer after that. Close to 30 mins between app plates being removed and entree plates being brought. The server really wasn't checking in very often either and was pretty much invisible after our entrees came.  The menu is all about showcasing Bobby's flair for all things southwestern and you won't find much that doesn't have at least some corn, chile, salsa, and/or spice. Appetizers were all in the $10 - 16 range and entrees started at about $30 with most meat dishes over $40. Sides are separate (of course) and they're $8 a pop. We ordered a lot of food for seven people, so I will only get into the highlights and lowlights of the dinner:  Menu Highlights      * Spanish Chorizo Quesadilla - This was by far the best thing on the appetizer menu (and arguably on the whole menu). It is served up with grilled green onions, artichokes and a smoky salsa. A fried egg adorns the top of the totrilla to complete the package. This was awesome. The flavors all work together and the chorizo had nice bite without overpowering the dish.     * Coffee Rubbed Filet Mignon - This was a nice sized filet, cooked perfectly to the requested medium rare. It came with a mushroom reduction sauced spiked with ancho chile. It was very tasty and the coffee rub added a nice nuance to the dish. The person eating it was kind enough to share some of it with us. I knew by the size of the smile on his face that it was a winner before I even tried any of it.     * Roasted Corn - Yes, this is a side dish, but it ranks as one of the better options on the menu. The corn kernels were crisp-tender and then tossed with cactus & lime. Some cotija cheese is sprinkled on top for good measure, too. Very tasty and worth the $8 for a bowl.   Menu Lowlights      * Tiger Shrimp & Roasted Garlic Tamale - I figured this dish was a no-brainer in this restaurant, maybe that's why it was such a huge disappointment. The shrimp were a nice size, but overcooked and the textured of the tamale itself seemed way too dry. This went mostly uneaten.      * Green Chile Ciopinno - Flay is known for award winning ciopinno, but let's say that this was not the finest example. Most of the seafood was overcooked, which was such a downer because the green chile broth was amazing (I'd order a bowl of the broth by itself if I could).     * Salmon with Ancho-Honey Glaze - This was a nice sized piece of salmon and, as opposed to the other seafood dishes, it was cooked perfectly. It was served with a spicy black bean sauce and a jalapeno crema. It all sounded like it would go well together, but it really amounted to just too much going on. On top of that, it was extremely salty. It all added up to a dish I wanted to forget about after a few bites.   Final Take   Mesa Grill was kind of a mixed bag for us. It did some things really well, but there were a lot of things that were 'meh', too. When you're talking about a place that was $100+ per person, I expect a bit more in the food and service department. If I had to do it over, I'd probably stick with having a drink and an app at the bar, then go get dinner elsewhere. My apologies to Bobby, but this is one throwdown that he lost because this foodie feels you can do far better on the Strip at this price point.  Overall Grade = C+ (Average)  The EV Foodie",

So the first thing you'll notice at this restaurant is that they love chili peppers...there are pictures, carvings, embossed logos of peppers everywhere...the doors, the mirrors, the tables, the roof etc.   Sounds good because i love spicy food.   However, the sad fact is nothing was really spicy at all.  I came here for brunch with a fairly large party and pretty much everyone was not impressed with what they got.     In fact I want to give this place ZERO stars because they did the impossible!  They messed up breakfast food!  I mean eggs? Bacon? Potatoes?!  Those things practically cook themselves!  And they are inherently so delicious I could put them in a bowl and microwave them and they'd be good!  Well,  this place has completely turned me off to anything Bobby Flay.",

    "text": "This review is based just on the weekend brunch. For me, this was one of those spots where it was really good the first time but was ehhhhh the next time.   Food: Plenty of great choices on Bobby Flay's brunch menu. The food has high-end Chef written all over it.. small servings, high-priced, but amazing flavor. As you are seated, you are given a basket of different breads and muffins that are super tasty and different. The YELP popular smoked salmon quesadilla is fantastic. At first glance, it looks like a simple dish that's bound to disappoint but no, this is some quality smoked salmon on top of a well-grilled quesadilla.  The chilaquiles is okay.. nothing special and was kind of cold.  The Spicy Chicken Sweet Potato Hash was pretty good. Loved the hollandaise sauce on it.  Ambiance: A colorful, classy restaurant with a wide-open space and views of the casino on one side and the kitchen staff doing their art on the other. Located in front of the giant sportsbook/pokerroom area of Caesars, this is a pretty restaurant with lots of appeal just from the outside. A good place for a social brunch whether you're with your significant or with a group of friends.   Service: Servers are very professional and friendly. They come by our table frequently to check on us. The food takes a lonnnngggg time to be served. I don't know if it's because they take their time to cook the food perfectly but the restaurant wasn't crazy busy and it was a bit of a wait.  Tips: If you're here for brunch, you HAVE TO try the smoked salmon quesadillas. Come earlier for brunch because the restaurant tends to get very busy during the peak of lunch.",

It was $20. It was, no exaggeration, 3 bites. 3 small tacos. One bite each. The flavor was out of this world, but I left feeling as if I didn't even eat.

I understand that since I was dining along that the hostess directed me to eat at the bar. However I was none the less put off as I saw there were plenty of empty tables throughout the evening. Maybe I am being picky but I don't really enjoy having my dinner sitting at a high top as I'm fairly short and my feet barely touch the bottom bar. Overall the food was fairly decent and a lively place to dine with friends. Noise level is about average. I ordered a glass of white wine, queso fundido (would be great for groups), honey glazed salmon, sauteed spinach, and a late harvest tokaji for dessert. Food was delicious, the queso fundido is a bit heavy and I would imagine it would be good to share. I would say attire shift from business casual to a bit more formal as the night wears.  I would definitely dine again the next time I am in town for regular dinners but maybe select another place for special occasions. Four stars for food and 3 for service.",

    "text": "After many years of watching the Food Network and seeing Bobby Flay mention his Mesa Grill I finally got a chance to stop in and try it out.  The place was packed, but I was on a business dinner so I am sure that they made reservations.  I found it funny when they said that our table was not ready and motioned that we can sit in the bar area and get drinks, but the second we ordered the table was miraculously ready.  I see this a lot so no worries.  I started with the queso dip and OMG it was liquid gooey crack.  So damn good and I couldn't stop eating it.  I wanted a steak but passed on it and got the lamb chops only because it came with a tamale side and the steaks had a side extra for $10.00.  I did notice when others ordered that when you get a side it is enough for two people.  The bread was really good especially the blue corn muffins, I could have stayed there and ate the whole basket.  The meal came and it was very good with perfect portion sizes.  It was busting with flavors.  My only complaint, or more like a warning and if I could take a 1/2 star away I would is that there are too many flavors.  Remember this is Bobby Flay that we are talking about.  If you are in the mood for a nice basic steak, go somewhere else, if you want a piece of fish with a basic cream sauce go somewhere else.  Here you will get spice, seasonings and peppers, not bad at all but just depends on what your mood is.  The service was some of the best that I ever saw and the crew was very helpful.  I am glad that I had a chance to visit Mesa Grill!!!",

Yes - Mesa has Pappy Van Winkle, which for bourbon connoisseurs is like drinking a unicorn.  We were lucky enough to be here for Restaurant Week, which meant we got a 3 course meal for $50. Not cheap, but honestly not bad compared to the rest of the high end strip restaurants. The chicken taco appetizer was nice and spicy and had a zesty little sauce. I went with the pork tenderloin for the main course. Good Lord. It's as tender and juicy as a filet, but the flavors are so bold and out of bounds. Insane.   Dessert was just as amazing and unique - chocolate and caramel salted pudding. WOW. Just the right balance of sweet and salty.   Bottom line: If you're a Karl Welzein bold flavors man from way back, Mesa is a must.",

    "text": "I'll just go ahead and get my main gripe out of the way: Mesa Grill is one of the most unimpressive looking 'fancy' restaurants that I have been to.  If it wasn't for the fact that it is in the middle of Cesar's Palace, I would have guessed that it was just your average South-Western/Mexican restaurant.  It was when the hostess asked me to remove my hat when I realized that they take themselves pretty seriously here, and thanks to the food, rightfully so.  My meal was delicious! I ordered the Tiger Shrimp Sweet Corn Tamale as an appetizer, the New York Steak as my main entree, and mash potatoes as a side.  I actually had a difficult time selecting what I wanted, because although the menu is small, most of the items were unusual dishes that I wasn't interested in trying.  The menu consisted of a lot of seafood and less traditional meats, and I just wanted something basic.  Thankfully everything that I ordered turned out to be really good.  The highlight was the shrimp appetizer.  It was ridiculously priced for how tiny it was, but the combination of flavors was outstanding.  The theme of the meal in general was flavor, and everything from the bread to the pear margarita that I ordered pack a ton of it.    In addition to my food, I tried my date's Pork Tenderloin.  It was amazing!  I would highly recommend it as a main dish, and it is most likely what I would order the next time I am here.  Mesa Grill is not a place that I could eat at all of the time, nor is it a place I would take someone to impress with ambiance.  However, they have superbly flavorful food that was well worth the visit.  It will not be one of my 'go-to' places when I visit the strip, but I can see myself coming back from time to time.",

    "text": "Classmates of mine worked at Mesa Grill when I went there for a private dinner banquet on May 13, 2009.  So with the help of one of them, we were able to get a very good package at a reasonable price, especially compared to the quote we received from the banquet's department at Caesar's Palace.  The waitstaff were great at taking our orders and during the meal service.  The back private banquet room was fairly large and accommodated our large party (can't recall the exact number, but we had well north of 60 people, all seated in 3 long rows of tables).  The Tiger Shrimp + Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale with Corn-Cilantro Sauce was simply delicious.  The tamale was top notch, and the Flay-concocted Corn-Cilantro Sauce will pair up nicely with other seafood and poultry dishes.    For my entree, I selected Bobby Flay's signature dish \"New Mexican Spiced Rubbed Pork Tenderloin, Bourbon-Ancho Chile Sauce + Sweet Potato Tamale with Crushed Pecan Butter\".  It was cooked perfectly and the flavors was very unique and complimented each other.  The sweet potato tamale was the best I have ever had.  I tried a sample of my friend's \"Coffee Rubbed Filet Mignon, Mushroom-Ancho Chile Sauce\".  Filet Mignon was good, but aside from being tender (which is why most people order it) it lacked the flavor I crave from beef, but the accompaning Mushroom-Ancho Chile Sauce was super!  The Blue Corn Crusted Alaskan Halibut + Salsa Cruda, Sweet 100 Tomatoes, Capers, Nicoise Olives, Fresh Basil + Oregano was also a nice fish entree.  And highly recommended.  I know this review is based on a banquet experience instead of the more typical restaurant dining experience, but the food overall was good to great.  Service was superb, and the price we were able to negotiate for the event was unbeatable (big thanks to Mitch and the restaurant GM!!!)  Decor: 4/5 Service: 4.5/5 Food: 4/5  Looking forward to going back for more.",

It was a full house on a Saturday afternoon, but we were seated right away.   CONS: They have a friendly staff but I have to say our food server was a space cadet.  She could not read our order she wrote down, so we had a long wait time for our food. Have to ask repeatedly for different things.  BBQ Lamb Cobb Salad was nothing special. Extreme little small pieces of lamb meat. The greens were too wet and limp. $17  House plain margarita in a short glass filled to the brine with ice for $14 was a rip off. The taste was rough. Tasted like premix margarita mix not fresh  ingredient.   PROS: Shrimp Tacos were a 5 star! $25 for two tacos but the best shrimp tacos I ever had in my life! Bursting with favor. We don't mind over paying for food If it is a party in my mouth.   Muffin basket was fantastic! Corn bread muffin, we're tasty. But my favorite was the Blueberry Coffee Cake. I asked for seconds. Our server said the recipe is in his cook book.  I will be looking for that recipe!  Cactus Apple Ice Tea  was serve with a side of simple syrup, nice touch.",

For an appetizer we had the tuna nachos. They weren't really nachos, but they were very good.  For my main dish, I had the spicy chicken and sweet potato hash.

The brunch menu at Mesa Grill was a bit limited.  I ordered the Scrambled Eggs Chilaquiles with roasted tomatillo sauce, white cheddar cheese, and creme fraiche.  The scrambled eggs were fluffy and not overcooked.  The tomatillo sauce had a nice background heat that didn't overpower the sauce.  The eggs sat atop blue corn tortillas that surprisingly maintained their texture and didn't disintegrate while cutting.    The presentation and flavor were just good; nothing extraordinary.  The portion was a little on the smallish side.    I recommend you try their partida margarita (which was notable), but go elswhere for food.",

I had the grilled lamb and poblano chili. Magnificent. Probably the most beautiful and best tasting meat I've ever eaten. The waiter was good too. Beverages were excellent: perfectly made margaritas and mixed drinks.  The cons are the fact this place is surrounded by old smelly Caesar's Palace. My eyes were burning with cigarette smoke by the time we got to the entrance (which is easy to walk past, if you hit Muhammed Ali coming from the north you've gone too far.)  Also: Two people and four drinks were $260 after tip. This is not a cheap place to eat, but totally worth it. Service was excellent.",

So if course a margarita and coffee rubbed filet, with tiger shrimp enchiladas, and cilantro mashed potatos it is. At first, I wondered how one could find a coffee rub on a steak appealing, but I found out. Words cannot describe the flavors in that steak .... well I guess if I were on death row and got my last meal, I would have to have this steak.

Service was a tad better than In and out Burger in California.

    "text": "Bobby Flay's Mesa is on our \"must go\" list every time we are in Vegas. The service is always good, and the food is incredibly flavorful. The complimentary bread basket is always very fresh. Based on our multiple dining experiences these are my suggestions:  Order a margarita...any margarita. They are all fantastic!   For starters I recommend the shrimp tamales, tuna nachos, or either of their salads. I do not recommend the tomato soup...it is very marinara like, and more of a bread dip than a soup.   As for the entrees I highly recommend the salmon. I always want to try something different, but I love the salmon so much I never can bring myself to stray. My husband can't part from the coffee rubbed filet.   You may not realize it, but most of the entrees are a la carte, so it's a good idea to order a side or two. The corn is a must try! I have tried (and failed) many time to replicate this dish. It is absolutely delicious. I have also had the twice baked potato and sauteed spinach, but they were both very underwhelming.   Mesa is the perfect spot for an upscale yet casual dinner! Do be sure to make reservations ahead of time as they tend to fill up fast.",

You can taste a complexity of his signature sauce, close your eyes and enjoy party in your mouth. I didn't expected the best as from Bobby Flay cooks for us, so all is great and the best execute.",

They served these lovely bite sized bread as appetizers and they were to die for.  These tiny morsels of treats came in 3 different varieties and we devoured it.  Our waiter told us that during certain weeks they would change the kind of breads they serve too.  I can't wait to return and try the other treats they have to offer.    My husband had the grouper meal for $24 and I had the mesa burger for $16.  It was a juicy burger and I opted for a side of fresh greens.  They cook their burgers to perfection and it tasted good even without cheese.    There wasn't anything on the menu that did not sound mouthwatering. I think they have a great knack in mixing incredible ingredients together and they mesh so well to create a fantastic dish.",

The night before we ate at another well-known chef restaurant and left dissatisfied with the food and the bill, so there was some hesitation to try another chef dining experience. At Flay's restaurant everything from the service to the food was exceptional. I had the pumpkin soup starter and the chile relleno as my main entree. My husband had the salad and the smoked shrimp tacos. Both of us were incredibly pleased and the prices are very reasonable! We would definitely eat here again!!",

Mesa has the most amazing service I've ever experienced at any restaurant, EVER! The servers work together as a team. It's not just one single server to your table, we had different staff refilling drinks, changing out utensils and asking if there was anything we had needed.  With that said, the food was amazing! I had ordered the chef special, which was 30$ or a three course meal! What a steal! And 5$ was donated to helping the hungry in Las Vegas... What a great cause.   My meal included: for my starter, the raw tuna 'nachos' (amazing) the main course, a blue corn tortilla crusted halibut (so flakey and buttery) and for dessert a hands down best cake I've ever had, coconut cream 4 layer cake!  Epic meal! I'd come back every time I visit Vegas.",

    "text": "It was an easy choice to have dinner at Mesa Grill since we were staying at the Caesars Palace and the fact that it was owned by the chef Bobby Flay.   We arrived around 6 pm on a Wednesday evening and seated promptly.    We ordered tiger shrimp corn tamale, coffee rubbed filet mignon, pork tenderloin and Brussels sprout salad.     The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the fresh tasting corn tamale was delicious.   The filet was very tender; however, it did not have much flavor.  Actually after we added tobacco sauce and it tasted better. This was the first time we had medium rare park tenderloin and it tasted great.  The Brussels sprout salad had lots of flavor and we loved it.    My husband had two martinis with a few cheese stuffed olives for $38.  We thought it was pretty stiff.    Overall, it was a good dining experience.  Will we return?  Probably not.",

    "text": "Sadly this place only get's 2-stars and here's why.  The place is beautiful, clean and well staffed. We explained to the hostess that we were in a bit of a time crunch so we couldn't take a leisure lunch. We had a plane to catch and needed food first.  We were seated promptly after a brief sit in the lovely waiting area.  Our waiter greeted us and informed us he was aware we were in a bit of a time crunch.  He asked if we wanted waters and would bring the drink menu for us.  We got our waters and ordered drinks. I ordered one of their signature margaritas - the waiter explained the different between the (I think) 4 of them.  I choose the one he indicated was the sweetest some sort of cactus.  I found it to be less sweet than expected - but it was very good.  He then took our food order.  There were three of us and I'll list all our food and comment on those items I tried.  SOPHIE'S CHOPPED SALAD - with Her Own Special Dressing + Crispy Tortillas --- 13.  My friend ordered it and she loved it - I also tasted it and it was very good, seemed fresh, and had a bunch of interesting things in it. I loved the dressing.  YUCATAN CHICKEN SKEWERS - Peanut - Smoked Chile Barbecue Sauce, Flour Tortillas, Pickled Red Onion + Mint --- 16.  Beware - the peanut smoked chile barbecue sauce is very spicy - while I enjoyed it - my friend felt it was just a bit too hot and didn't really come with a \"warning\". She's not a fan of spicy food and avoided dipping her chicken into this. This dish was served with the tiniest flour tortillas.  MESA BURGER - Double Cheddar Cheese, Grilled Vidalia Onion + Horseradish Mustard served with Southwestern Fries --- 18.  You like cheese? Then you'll love this burger. It was ordered medium well and it came that way. Meat was very tasty - but I am NOT a fan of cheese.  The Southwestern Fries were a bit salty.  HOT SMOKED SALMON CLUB - Bacon, Avocado, Tomato, Arugula, Chipotle Aioli + Southwestern Fries --- 18.  This is what I ordered. I love seafood and was excited to try a smoked salmon club.  It came cut in half (thank you!) and was piled high with a cold smoked salmon mixture like the way tuna salad is mixed. You could taste the smoke and it reminded me of Alder wood smoked salmon from the Pacific Northwest. The bacon was thick and cooked to perfection. Lots of avocado. Basically all the toppings were fresh and yummy and the sandwich oozed out from all angles. I loved the Chipotle Aoili sauce and actually used it to dip my fries into. I also felt the fries were a bit salty but dipping into the sauce sort of muted the over saltiness.  This sandwich is not a HOT sandwich.  Here's the reason Mesa Grill only get's 2 stars - Within an hour after eating my Hot Smoked Salmon Club - I became sick ... I was in the cab on the way to the airport when it started to hit me and I was like OH GREAT! I'm about to have to wait in lines and my luck there would be NO bathroom for miles!!  I warned my friends and one offered some Imodium - which I promptly took without water (YUCK)!!  This same friend ate the other half of my sandwich on the way to the airport - so I warned her to be careful.  Sure enough while loading onto the plane - she told me she wasn't feeling well either ... So that being said - 2 stars. You made me and my friend sick with your bad salmon!  I subtract a star for each time I had to run to the restroom with Salmon revenge!!  The decor was beautiful and like I said waitstaff was terrific. Serving bad salmon is no BUENO!",

I could've sat and just had those.   The tiger shrimp roasted garlic corn tamale.  Yes, it tastes as good as it sounds.  No more description necessary; rough cut tuna nachos (tasty tuna tartare) with a tangy habanero sauce.  Roasted corn in a chile aioli cheese meld. Spectaculous. for the coupe de gras, a rib eye that was cooked (again)  just right.  Do it.",

The free jalapeno muffins and brunch bread basket was a nice touch and really unique flavors.  We tried the the tuna tartar with mango and chips as an appetizer.  The chili relleno had an amazing filling with eggplant, cheese, and other veggies.  The bf had a huge swordfish sandwich that he loved.  We were impressed and stuffed.  This is a huge location in Cesar's Palace .  Attentive and pleasant service and delicious food.  Definitely add it to your Vegas culinary adventures list!",

They had Bobby Flay's books, spices and other items. To start off, we had their bread basket. I've had better. We also ordered the yellow cornmeal crusted oysters for appetizer, we liked this one.    For our main dish, we ordered NY Strip Steak a side of sauteed spinach (more like steamed) and Cioppino which is a combination of seafood with butter sauce. I was kind of disappointed on the menu selection. I thought the food was a little salty, too much spice. We also had espresso and coconut cake for dessert which was recommended by our server. Coconut cake was not great, but it will do for my sweet cravings.   Chances of coming back, neh! I'd rather go to Emeril's.",

Came for brunch and ordered the quesadilla appetizer to start with a Bloody Mary. Quesadilla was good, but not worth $16. Not hard to make something with bacon taste good. Bloody Mary was good too, but once again again not worth $10. For the main course I had the chiliquiles . . . He needs to review what a chiliquile is. What I got was a very dry corn tortillas, dense scrambled egg on top and some sauces drizzled over . . . Was more of a poorly constructed tostada if anything. Also, the grits were appalling, way over seasoned. The best thing about my visit here was the waiter. Polite, personable and attentive. Will not be coming back to this extremely over priced establishment.",

    "text": "This is the first time that I have been to Mesa Grill.  I have been to Bar Americain in New York City so I already somewhat knew to expect at a Bobby Flay restaurant.  My dinner when I went to Bar Americain was exceptional and I was expecting the same at Mesa Grill, but I think that my expectations were a little high.    What we ordered between the two of us: - Tiger Shrimp Tamale - Sophie's Chopped Salad - Mesa Burger - Pork Tenderloin Sandwich - Buttermilk Pineapple Upside Down Cake - Chocolate Chip Strawberry Shortcake (dessert of the day)  Positives.... - The tiger shrimp tamale was amazing.  By far my favorite thing that I have had at a Bobby Flay restaurant.  The shrimp was almost undercooked but was done enough to eat.  The filling of the tamale was sweet and there was an under tone of Flay's famous heat in the sauces.  The corn-cilantro cream sauce was perfect to accent the tamale. - You could taste the quality of the meat of the burger.  It was exceptional and cooked perfectly.  You can hardly get your mouth around it because it is so large!   - The cake itself in the pineapple upside down cake was moist and delicious. - As always, the fries and Flay's restaurants are great!  We had the southwestern fries with our meals and then were spicy but good!  Negatives: - First off the server was an absolute snob so we got unlucky there.  I would have given this post 4 stars but took one away because of the server.   - The pork tenderloin sandwich was served with the meat freezing cold.  I was very surprised by this.  The sandwich would have been much better if the meat wasn't cold. - When our server brought Flay's \"famous\" bread basket to our table there were only two cold muffins in it that were clearly left from the night before.  One of my favorite parts of my Flay meal in the past was the variety of breads in the basket.  The tables around us got a variety like I expected to get.  I attribute this to our sucky server.  Overall the meal was a positive one but I don't know if I will be back to Mesa Grill in the future but I definitely recommend the restaurant to any Bobby Flay fans that would like to experience his southwestern flavors.",

    "text": "Had to try this place being that it's one of Bobby Flay's.  There was a 45 minute wait so we sat at the bar.  Even with the bar staff, the service was solid.  The food as has been well documented is fantastic if you make the right choices.  The blue cornmeal muffins that come out with the bread are excellent.  I started with the tiger prawn tamale.  The tamale itself was done perfectly and not over spiced, instead letting the subtle maza mix with the sweet and smoky corn veloute served under it.  The prawns themselves were succulent and extremely fresh.  My main course was the grouper.  It was very good, but nothing too original or mind blowing.  The highlight of my meal was actually the side of corn I wittingly ordered.  I usually have a knack for picking the best item on a menu (or at least the one that sounds like they really know what they're doing on that also fancies my taste buds) and this corn was another prime example of that.  The roasted corn is done in a cream stock with nopal (cactus), with hints of lime and topped with cotija cheese.  The result is a perfect balance of a rich blend of sweet, sour, and salty.  All in all, the food lives up to the billing, though I think it's better to stick with the signature dishes.",

Getting reservations was a challenge (did I really need to be transferred to 3 different people just to make one..?). Upon entering and being greeted, the ostentatious attitude of the staff was a bit much.. I mean, come one, it's just a restaurant at Ceasar's.. I'm not in Paris, San Francisco or the like... What was the worst part was the insensitivity of one of the hostesses. She really needed training. I wrote a letter to the corporate office some weeks after our visit with no reply. I guess they don't care if their staff offends an occasional patron, but that will be the first and last time I eat there. We had way better service at the Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill.. and it's a much more casual environment. Bobby Flay, you might want to investigate.",

The wait staff is very friendly, and knowledgeable, our waiter spaced out the appetizers and main entree perfectly, I hate when they bring everything at once.   For an appetizer we got the corn crusted fried oysters and the Tuna \"nachos\" both of which were insane. My girlfriend got the lamb chops and I got a steak both of which again were insane. The price was a bit steep but nothing more than we expected, it is Bobby Flay's restaurant afterall. I would love to go back for lunch to see what else he's kookin up back there.  Oh yeah get the house margarita one of the best I ever had. Side note I asked the waiter if Bobby Flay ever comes in and cooks for patrons?She said \"sometimes but  when he does come in he almost always cooks for the staff.\" Way to go Bobby!!!!!",

    "text": "*3.5*  (this review is for lunch only)  so, my fiancee and i had just dined at Bradley Ogden the evening before; act two, enter Bobby Flay...  no wait, we were seated right away.  nice.  our server was a chippery asian fella.  he was very informative and full of energy.  he also almost put his hand on my fiancee's shoulder when he first walked up to our table but quickly diverted said stranger hand just in the nick of time.  smart move buddy!  they brought out a little bread basket w/ some goodies.  YUM.  probably the best part of the meal.  jalapeno biscuits, crumb cake, and some other pastries that got me excited about the entree's to come.  first we had our \"grapefruit mimosas\" we ordered off the menu.  they were quite tasty but at $12.50 a pop, i should have gotten a bloody mary or something.  i had the burger.  i got it medium well bc our server said their \"medium\" was more on the medium rare side.  well, as i bit into the burger, parts of the patty were well done while some parts were sorta pink, i guess.  eh, it was still pretty tasty.  the pickled vidalia onion was a nice touch.  i'm a huge fan of mustard but i think i would have liked a more sweeter, tangy-er sauce to balance out the pungent, sharp cheddar on top.  the fries were OK, a little too cooked for my taste.  they had a nice cajun spice sprinkled over them that wasn't overpowering.  my fiancee had the salmon.  the description sounded better than it tasted.  i was expecting an explosion of sweet, spice, savory, etc., etc., especially from Mr. Flay.  but the fish, albeit fresh and cooked properly, wasn't very flavorful.  oh well.  w/ tax and tip the lunch came out to a little over $80.  not sure if we'll be back.",

Had I known of the Food Network association beforehand I would have worried about things like over-priced, over-hyped mediocre food that plagues many \"famous\" Las Vegas establishments.   Having said that, this meal was a solid 4 stars. We had the Smoked Chicken and Black Bean Quesadilla for an appetizer (although our server really tried to push the Tiger Shrimp on us... maybe next time) which was good, although I would have preferred the flour tortillas a little less burnt. For the main course I had the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin and it was phenomenal. I ordered the pork medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. The dish itself was a little too spicy for my tastes, but I can definitely still appreciate it. The main attraction for me was the Sixteen Spice Chicken which my boyfriend got. This was hands down the best chicken I have ever had in my entire life. I don't really know what else to say besides that.   The entrees really brought up my opinion of this restaurant. I will say the margaritas were just decent - the white peach was my favorite, and the house was way, way too sweet. Skipped dessert too as nothing really looked good to me (and I never skip dessert), but then again I'm not usually a fan of Mexican inspired sweets so that's definitely not Mesa's fault. And at ~$100/person, we didn't need dessert anyway.",

His suggestions were great because I had no complaints about the food and the food was amazing.  For an appetizer we had the Garlic Shrimp Tamale. It was delicious, the shrimp were perfectly cooked and the sauce went so well with the shrimp. Also the tamale really went with the shrimp.  We had 4 things, the Pork Tenderloin, Veal chop, Lamb chop and the roasted Brussels sprout salad . The Pork tenderloin was very soft and the sauce went well with it. I also liked how all the meat dishes came with a tamale, each with a different taste to go with it. It's been a quite a while since I ate at Mesa grill so I forgot what went with the Pork Tenderloin, I think it was a sweet Tamale. The Veal chop was so moist and soft. The ratio of fat to meat was perfect. The reason I really liked the Veal chop was that it was really juicy, but the juices don't flow out of the meat, but instead stay in the chop. I think the tamale I got with the Veal chop was a cheesy one. The Lamb chop was also really good, which is saying something as I don't normally like the taste of lamb. The brussel sprout salad was also delicious. The brussel sprouts were perfectly charred, and the pomegranates added a nice sweet touch.  I highly recommend eating here",

Nothing against them, but they're busy living celebrity lives and not on the line yelling out orders or cooking the actual food. Mesa Grill was not that-ok I mean no Bobby was not there unfortunately, but for how good the food was, you could've fooled me!  To start they bring out a bread basket. It's got four offerings. The first two- a savory little jalapeno bread bite and a dried fruit scone- both good but not mind blowing. The other two were very good though. I loved the corn muffin- it had a mix of yellow corn and blue corn giving a two toned effect- very creative! I also absolutely loved the pumpkin cranberry coffee cake. So delicious, I may need to re-create this for thanksgiving!   For my meal I ordered the spicy chicken and sweet potato hash. WOW. This was the quality southwest inspired food I'd expect from Bobby Flay. The hash was composed of pieces of smoky chicken, soft sweet potatoes and some veggies like peppers. It was topped with perfectly poached eggs and a green chile hollandaise. That hollandaise...so good. It also had some other saucy elements- a signature Bobby herb oil along with what I'm guessing was a romesco sauce (don't quote me though, it's not mentioned in the menu description so I'm not 100%). Everything came together in such a harmonious way. Definitely recommend this dish/restaurant if you're in Vegas. Brunch at Bobby's will not let you down!",

Hubby has sampled several dishes, and has enjoyed all of them (I think he's had every seafood option) but I order the pork tenderloin EVERY time. It is SOOO good. It is always perfectly cooked and tender, and the two different sauces along with the spice rub on the meat all work together to create a wonderful flavor combination. (I always ask to switch out the sweet potato tamale for the goat cheese one that is usually paired with a different dish. I like the goat cheese version much better)  For an appetizer, I love the queso fundido, which is unlike the queso fundido that you will find at any mexican restaurant, but is delicious in it's own unique way.  Good margaritas and excellent, attentive service as well.",

We waited for a few minutes before the hostess came out to greet us and show us our table. We asked our waiter for recommendations,  but he kinda said well it depends on what you like ... . Anyways to cut it short, he couldn't give us any good recommendations because the items he recommended us doesn't taste great.  The mesa steak was overly salty.  The halibut, pork loin burger and the Chile burger (which he claimed award-winning) was nothing to shout about. We complained about the salty burger but the waiter didnt offer to take the item off the bill.  We forced ourselves (yes forced as we didnt want to waste food) to eat the steak.  We asked for a discount since the steak was so bad but instead of acknowledging the steak was bad, he chose to argue with us over why he would not give us a discount! Overall it's a really bad experience!  Sorry Bobby Flay, I was a fan but not anymore!  I wonder if we were treated this way due to racism!",

Smoked shrimp tacos were a very satisfying lunch. The shrimp were cooked perfectly and came with the toppings of guacamole, mango salsa, and tomatillo salsa.  All worked great with the cabbage to fill the taco.  The portion size was two tacos with three shrimp in each.  Also, the margarita was an actual margarita made with fresh ingredients and not a sugary mix.",

Flavors were balanced, well placed heat that had flavor without blowing out your mouth. (Btw-we do love very spicy food. We asked for a side of a spicy vinaigrette for some extra heat but that wasn't truly needed) it had just the right amount of everything. Not overly loaded with cheese or drowning in sauce but just enough. The complimentary bread basket was amazing- a variety of sweet to savory baked goods. Our meal came with grits or potatoes- both flavorful. This meal for under $40, was more satisfying and memorable than the $400 meal we had at michael minas. Great for vegetarians that like flavorful meals (as opposed to a salt,pepper, some herb of the day buttery sauce most chefs can't seem to think beyond in a vegetarian offering)",

Their complimentary bread basket was good. I especially enjoyed the corn muffin. I loved how it was baked with half yellow corn and half blue corn. I thought that was pretty cool. However, I wished that the corn muffins and the cranberry wheat bread were served warm like the jalapeno bread. They were served room temperature and after awhile it became very cold. Bread is just so much better when it's hot and warm!   For an appetizer we shared the tiger shrimp and roasted garlic corn tamale. It was soooo good! This was my favorite dish of our meal. The only thing was that for a $20 appetizer, you would expect more than just 3 pieces of shrimp.   For entrees my boyfriend got the Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops and I got the Mango + Spice Crusted Tuna Steak.   My boyfriend really enjoyed his lamb chops. I thought my dish was just okay. I thought that there was way too much flavor going on. The cous cous that came with the tuna was spiced way too heavily. The tuna was already seasoned with a lot of spice, so there's not really a need to serve it with heavily spiced cous cous. The flavors of the tuna and the accompaniments were too intense and it didn't go well together.   Overall, although my entree wasn't satisfying, I don't regret coming here because I finally got to try one of Bobby Flay's restaurant. However, because of the price and the just okay food, we probably won't be back. It was a one time experience for us.",

    "text": "CAESARS PALACE SWEEPSTAKES WINNER ADVENTURE #4: SECOND COMPED DINNER  On my second night of three free nights staying at Caesars Palace, Mariah Carey was performing at the Colosseum. As a sweepstakes winner I had a free ticket to the concert. That same night before the concert I ate at a celebrity chef restaurant to make the evening a celebrity-themed event. Several months before my vacation at Caesars Palace I looked at two celebrity chef restaurants at Caesars Palace that I ate at before in 2014: Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill and Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill. Of the two I had a mixed experience eating at Mesa Grill. For the amount I paid at Mesa Grill the dinner well was below expectations. So the obvious conclusion would to eat at Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill again correct? No because of the $600 dining credit I received as one of the winners of the \"I Am Caesar\" Sweepstakes I decided to eat at Mesa Grill again. The first time I ate at Mesa Grill I paid for dinner. This time dinner at Mesa Grill would be free.  One of the conveniences of Mesa Grill is that it is across from the Colosseum. So there was no need for a quick dinner at Mesa Grill. I can enjoy the pleasures of dinner before Mariah Carey concert, which started at 8:00 PM; my dinner reservation at Mesa Grill was 6:00 PM. Unlike the first comped dinner at Rao's the night before, I decided to be more aggressive with the dining credit of $200 for that night. Looking at the menu I noticed I can order a lot of appetizers that can help me use much of dining credit. I ordered the appetizers as tapa dishes. The items were the burrata tostada, tiger shrimp tamale, and barbecue duck on blue corn. The burrata tostada resembled the southwestern version of caprese salad with its burrata cheese and tomato. The shrimp tamale is slightly heavy because of the corn however the combination of the shrimp and corn add sweetness to the dish. I ordered the barbecue duck because it was on blue corn, which is a staple ingredient of Mesa Grill. I liked the duck as it had a smokiness flavor to it. The duck had a similar taste to ham so this dish reminded me of pulled pork.  Last time I ate at Mesa Grill I ordered the New Mexico pork tenderloin for the entree as that was the signature dish. This time I ordered the fire roasted veal chop. Normally I like my beef medium rare but at the recommendation of my server I had it cooked medium. What's the verdict of the fire roasted veal chop? This dish is the winner. It was much better than the New Mexico pork tenderloin. The presentation looked like a pork chop however the meat was very soft to cut through. A quality of a good, cooked meat is that you don't need any sauce because the meat is delicious. That was the case with the fire roasted veal chop. The thyme butter on the veal chop was all the seasoning that was needed. The veal chop at Mesa Grill is better than any pork chop or lamb chop I've had at any restaurant. I ended the meal by having the chocolate toffee sticky pudding. The dessert was a good end to satisfying dinner but it didn't make me bloated before the Mariah Carey concert.  The dinner I at Mesa Grill was better than I had in 2014. In addition my dinner at Mesa Grill was better than my dinner at Rao's the night before. Of all the 3 comped dinners I had while I was at Caesars Palace the dinner at Mesa Grill was the best. I guess Bobby Flay is in my good graces. What also helps is that I didn't have to pay for dinner. As with Rao's my dinner at Mesa Grill had a limit of $200 to comp for the night. Did I fully use it? I uploaded a picture of my comped receipt. For not paying dinner for 2 straight nights I'm reminded of a quote from a Mel Brooks' movie - \"It's good to be the king.\"",

    "text": "The Vegas Strip is littered with eateries by famous Food Network and other TV chefs. Some are solely in business due to their name and others stick around because the food can stand alone. This place is the later. The food was thoughtfully prepared, flavorful and absolutely delicious.   We came in for brunch and got to taste a view of Chef Bobby's dishes. I got the tostada. The tortilla was crisp and covered with cheese and eggs with a mole sauce and chili drizzle. It had a slight kick. I ordered it with crisp home fries that were served diced and perfectly fried. I would highly recommend this dish for a simple yet flavorful brunch.   The rest of the table tried the spicy scramble and the salmon. The spicy scramble wasn't too hot unless you got a pepper in your bite. The salmon was cooked tender. Even at well done, it was very soft.   We ended our meal with a sticky toffee pudding. It was a good mix between decadent yet still not too heavy.   The thing about this place that's so great is the blend of flavors in each dish. There are so many tasty Tex Mex flavors that are delicious. Check it out in the Caesars casino.",

    "text": "My brother informed me we would be going to Mesa Grill for my father's birthday... First thing I did was check out the menu cause I'm obsessed with food (but really it runs in my DNA cause my whole family loves it). Well, after reviewing it on line I was SOOOO UNDERWHELMED. Everything sounded disgusting to me and I just crossed my fingers HOPING the waitstaff would be able to doctor my order for me (ie - no sauce, naked, etc). Now I am not just a picky eat for picky sake, I have to be for food intolerances and allergies, thus naked it generally the route I take with my food...   So when it was my turn to order, I had our waiter Sheldon (who kicks ass by the way!! Seriously, awesome guy), come closer to me so we could create a dinner I'd be excited to eat! And guess what?! We were able to!!   I ordered NAKED Salmon, with NAKED roast Brussels Sprouts and Steamed Spinach... Oh and I got double the guac from the appetizer menu and paired it with my salmon. While the guac was delicious, I honestly ordered it just in case the same turned out dry and bland (because when walking to our table, I saw them grilling fish and it looks over cooked), alas it was NOT! It was moist AF, I could have eaten three more fillets, no joke! What was also no joke, their Brussels sprouts. HOLY WOW YES! Sooo perfect! So so so perfect! No need to get sauces and cheese on them, naked is the way to go (with oil). I have to admit, I totally could have and would have ordered another side of Brussels Sprouts if we had time for dessert, sadly we didn't! THANK YOU SHELDON GOR GETTING MY WHOLE DOCTORED DINNER ORDER RIGHT!!!   So it sounds like my rating should be 5 stars, right? Well, while my meal gets 4 (maybe 4.5)... And Sheldon gets a 5+... The reason my review is only 3 stars is because the rest of the table was a tad bit mixed on whether their food was good or not. I'd like to specifically talk about my husband who went outside his comfort zone and had the shrimp tamales and the steamed Halibut. He really loved the shrimp tamales but I had a sneaking suspicion that he would hate the Halibut and I even asked a few times WHY he ordered it, ha! And guess what? I was right. He was NOT A FAN. That being said, he mentioned that if people like Halibut and Food STEAMED, they could very well like it but he... DID NOT. My mom got the same thing and while she's a Halibut lover, I know she had serious plate envy when she saw my Salmon and my sister's Ahi Tuna! I asked her how she liked her dish and she simply said, \"eh\".   I highly doubt we will EVER go back to Mesa Grill, however, I'm really glad my dinner turned out tasty, otherwise I would have been super bummed!!!",

The menu has soooo many options, you can find Salmon, duck, chicken, baby vale, halibut and more. Very unique and amazing options to choose from.   I ordered the pork tenderloin that came with a sweet potato tamale on the side. FYI almost all of the entrees do not come with sides, have to order separately. The tenderloins came out tasty and the sauce complimented it just right. However, I had to ask for a better knife, I was unable to slice the pork...I was having a tougher time than I expected. I thought it should be more moist and soft, it was not. The tamale was dry and the texture was too gritty. No flavor at all, I hate to be harsh but it's True.   For an appetizer we ordered the pancake duck, absolutely my favorite! It was moist, a kick of spice, sweet, not fatty at all, and flavored all around just right. It had figs in it too, which was really unique but oh so good.   The ambiance was modern, trendy and romantic. Lights semi dimmed which sets the romantic mood. Customer service was great, the waiter came to check on us frequently and was very attentive. I made reservations about 2 hours ahead and got a table without a problem for a party of two.   Overall, the place is beautiful, the options on the menu is amazing. I would try it, because, we'll it's Bobby Flay's restaurant lol even though my dish was good, I want to come back and try other options on the menu.",

We were seated right on time and our waiter was quick to come over and go over the menu as well as the special of the evening.  We decided to split the red Chile barbecue duck as an app. I ordered the 16 spice chicken and the BF ordered the ancho Chile honey glazed salmon. The bread that they brought to the table was delicious, 3 different types. The BF really liked the duck, I was just kinda so-so with that dish. We both really enjoyed our entrees. I'd give the slight edge to the salmon in terms of flavor, though both dishes were cooked perfectly and both were delicious.  I realize it's Vegas and the norm for the strip, but, I thought the portion sizes were rather small for the price. That's really the only negative I'd report though. Don't know how soon we'd go back, but we definitely would.",

We started with a round of Partida Margaritas that blew us away.. They were the perfect combination of sweet and tart. Next, we had the tiger shrimp and roasted garlic corn tamale. The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the corn tamale had a spicy flavor. They also brought out a basket of cornbread, jalapeno & cheese bread, and raisin bread. All were yummy and a different assortment of flavors!! For dinner, I had the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin. The seasoning was the perfect blend of spicy and the pork was so tender. It was so filling, but I could not stop eating it. The sweet potato tamale that comes with it was also full of flavor. So much goodness.  The decor is modern with bright, bold colors all over to match the brand. It is dim, giving it a romantic feel. Our server was great, offering awesome recommendations and checking on us frequently.   We made a reservation on Open Table ahead of time, but it wasn't too busy at 6 p.m. on a Sunday. I highly recommend stopping in!",

I have only one con, it's an open restaurant and the seating is very close to each other and it's very loud.   The food and service by far exceeded our expectations.   Appetizer: Bread was brought and it was mixed basket of bread with different flavors. We ordered the \"Charred Shishito Peppers\" and it was very good either sauce it came with and it's mild in the spiciness level.   Entree: I got the \"Sixteen Spice Chicken\" the mango on top was really good and a tad spicy. The chicken was a good proportion and tasted really well with the garlic mango sauce. The mashed potatoes was a good complimentary item.   My fiance ordered an appetizer \"Tiger Shrimp and roasted garlic corn tamale\" along with a side of \"Cilantro Pesto Mashed Potatoes\" the shrimp was really tasty and well done. She didn't finish the corn tamale. But her favorite was the mashed potatoes.   We were absolutely stuffed and passed on the dessert, but we did get two glasses of Rose.   It's a pricey restaurant with a more casual atmosphere.",

Fortunately, our friends recommended Mesa Grill - and we were not disappointed.  Truly, every aspect of the experience was awesome.    The venue itself is beautiful with cozy round tables.  The service was impeccable.   And the food, it was ah-mazing.    First, we were able to order a bottle of wine for under $50 --- that's challenging anywhere, more so on the Strip.  Our server dropped off a basket of bread with three different types - all of which were delicious.    For appetizers, we ordered the tuna nachos and the bbq duck - the flavors and textures really popped.  For dinner, I had the salmon that just MELTED in my mouth.  My husband had the halibut with a sauce that I'll dream about for months.    While I don't frequent Las Vegas, if I find myself there again -- Mesa Grill will be on the must-visit list.",

The ceiling is cool and the colored fixtures at the front are neat. 8 of us were there at 2pm so the place pretty empty. The server was fair. She had a bit of a condescending attitude and wasn't pleasant,  just got the job done in s matter of fact way. The lunch menu is SMALL, not a lot of choices at all. The food came out in a good amount of time and looked beautiful. The food was very good, high quality a bit over priced on many of the items. The iced tea came with simple syrup which was a very nice touch. All in all, I'm glad I went but its certainly not on the list of \" must return.\"",

    "text": "When trying to find the best choice to use a Caesars food comp sometimes I'm left scratching my head. I've been to most of their dining options and I'm usually disappointed half the time. So after a very discouraging last trip to Gordon Ramsay Steak, we settled on an oldie but goodie, Mesa Grill at Caesars Palace.  Mesa is one of the first absentee celebrity chef restaurants to come to Las Vegas. Caesars operates the establishment and Bobby Flay shows up once or twice a year to make it look like he's involved. These are his recipes but that's about as far as it goes. With that being said, Mesa has stood the test of time and has been there since 2004. It had been almost 5 years since my last visit for dinner. For a restaurant to stick around this long continuity and consistency must be present. Mesa can still deliver a delicious southwestern style meal with the best of them. We started off with a few stiff Cadillac Margaritas made with Partida Tequila, and they were tasty. Bobby Flay's 16 ingredient Blue Corn Muffins make up possibly the best bread basket on the strip. We decided to stick with tried and True Mesa Grill classics so the appetizer of Tiger Shrimp with Roasted Corn Tamale was the perfect spicy starter. I had the Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin and it couldn't have been cooked any better. It did pack a punch of heat along with great flavor. My friend had the Fire Roasted Veal Chop, also cooked perfectly with a Chorizo, goat cheese tamale. It was excellent, and  a dish I will go back to get. An outstanding accompaniment was the Roasted Brussel sprouts with Toasted Sesame and Guajillo Chile and Cotija cheese. The portions were huge and we took plenty of food back to the room and stored it in the fridge for a nice next day snack. Service was on point and friendly, plus I have always liked the vibe of being just off the casino and being able to see the massive sports book tv's from our seats. Mesa Grill is still a colorful vibrant spot after all these years. Very much recommended. -- at Mesa Grill.",

    "text": "I was so full after leaving this restaurant that I was almost uncomfortable. But it was so worth it.   We decided to do the summer prix fixe menu, which included an appetizer, entree, and dessert for $50. I also decided to do a cactus pear margarita which was sweet, refreshing, and the perfect strength for me, as I usually don't drink tequila. For the appetizer I went with the roasted corn soup, which was creamy and perfectly warm. I could've eaten a quart of the corn soup, it was so good. For the entree, I decided on the sixteen spiced chicken, which was topped with a kind of spicy mango relish and served with cilantro pesto mashed potatoes. The chicken was blackened, but also tender and juicy. I really enjoyed the mango relish paired with the chicken and I liked having the mashed potatoes to cool down my mouth a bit from the spice of chicken and relish. For dessert I chose the chocolate and berry shortcake, which was warm and rich, but was also very fresh feeling from the berries and cream and the perfect size to not be overly rich.   Overall, we enjoyed the meal and we're looking forward to coming back in the future to try out some more menu items ( I had my eye on the queso but it wasn't part of the prix fixe menu). I'd recommend giving this spot a look for lunch or dinner, the prices of items on the regular menu did not seem out of line for strip prices and the food was amazingly delicious.",

Having never been to Vegas before, the location inside Caesar's Palace threw me off a bit. To me, Caesars Palace is just....tacky. But it's Vegas so that's the look they were going for I guess.   Anyhow, they were of course totally booked so we ended up getting a seat at the bar. I thought this was actually better than sitting at a table and we had plenty of room. We started off with a White Pear Margarita which was easily the best (albeit relatively overpriced) cocktail I had in town.   I wasn't particularly hungry but wanted to get a taste of the menu so I ended up getting a bunch of appetizers. The Barbecue Ribs were out of this world -- peanut chipotle sauce, garnished with some green onion and peanut relish. The Lobster Tacos were very yummy but so tiny. I was warned, but for 20 bucks I thought it'd be a bit bigger. Literally every bit of everything else was equally outstanding though.   I would highly recommend making a reservation and not coming too hungry.",

Our appetizer, Goat Cheese \"Queso Fundido\"  was creative and very good. Daughter ordered Spicy Chicken + Sweet Potato Hash. This too was very simple, creative dish as expected with Flay perfection.  Wish I had been more adventurous, went with a Mesa Burger.  Burger was ordered as 'medium'. Got served with cold fry's and they replaced it in a timely fashion. Very disappointed with the Burger...... it was way over cooked, heavy char-grill. Now running out of time to leave for airport, did not bother calling server. Left it uneaten with couple of bites. Told server of my order and he just ignored it with no apology not did he offer to take it off the bill.  Taking it off the check is not an issue, in my opinion, prices are very reasonable. other wise it was a good experience, but the burger and the server's attitude left a sour note.",

The restaurant definitely lived up to the hype for me. The appetizer the Glazed Ribs and Tiger Shrimp and Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale was tasty. The glaze on the ribs was unique.The corn tamale complimented the shrimp very well. For my entree, I decided to try the shrimp and grits. Growing up in the south, I really enjoyed this dish. The flavors from the shrimp and grits were unbelievable. This dish definitely hit the mark. I had a hard time choosing a dessert. All the choices on the dessert menu sounded delicious. I decided to go with the Toasted Coconut Cake. I made a good choice because the cake was finger licking good. The coconut cake had just the right amount of coconut flavor. The service was good. The waiter was attentive for a packed restaurant. Reservations are highly recommended at Mesa Grill. I got into the restaurant late in the evening. Although Mesa Grill is located in Caesars Palace, the restaurant has a nice romantic atmosphere. Mesa Grill is a good restaurant to enjoy Bobby Flay inspired dishes.

You can't forget about his remarkable and created sauce to compliment the dishes. Every time (5 times now) I've been impressed by the food. Great food cooked to perfection. Here are my recommendations:   Appetizers: -Tiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Corn Tamales - Oh my gosh! The tamales just melted in your mouth topped off with a cilantro sauce.  -Blue Corn Pancake - All I wanted to do is to love the Bbq duck down since it was soft and tender infused with the Habanero Chile sauce.   Main Course: -22 oz Bone In Chipotle Glazed Rib-eye with a red and green chile Sauce - You know when you come to Bobby's place you have to order a meat dish. In the words of Usher, all I can say is \"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, You make me wanna say, oh, oh, oh, oh Oh My goshh!\" The meat was Orgasmic, juicy with lots of flavor from the chipotle glaze.  -Pork Tenderloin had a nice rub and the meat was tender and flavorful. The roasted tomato tamale with key lime butter complimented the dish.  Side Dish: -Roasted Corn with Grill Cactus, Lime, and Cotija  All the flavors combined in your mouth will have your taste buds dancing to the tunes of Usher's song \"OMG!\"",

Albeit a bit reluctant (being not a huge fan of kale), I could not believe how good it was.  The kale and shaved Brussels sprouts were finely cut and shredded and very tender. Coupled with the seeds, cheese and dressing -- it was incredible!  I then opted for the long standing signature pork dish (one of 3 suggested dishes) which gave new meaning to pork; it was coupled with the perfect tamale side dish--sweet potatoes and pecans.  I paired the pork with a glass of lovely Spanish wine (again my server's suggestion) and it was an ideal accompaniment to the dish.  This was definitely a wonderful evening for any \"foodie\" and wine lover.  Kuddos to Chris, (my server) who turned my evening into a culinary delight with his suggestions and outstanding service!  (And btw, although I am on a low carb diet, I did try all the breads which were equally good --although I only ate ALL of the corn muffin.). Thank you Bobby Flay and Chris!",

Luckily, although we had reservations at 8:30 and arrived early at 8, we were seated right away.  I wasn't feeling to well so I asked for a hot water with lemon and honey. I was pleasantly surprised when the bill came and was not charged for it.   For my appetizer, I ordered the pan seared scallops, which were cooked to perfection. Every bite pretty much melted in my mouth. I ordered the pork tenderloin, cooked medium, for my entree and it was perfect. After both dishes, I was too full for dessert.  My bf ordered the lobster tacos for his appetizer and it was AMAZING. The shell was so crispy, and the lobster filling was very flavorful. It came it 3 pieces, but were very small, pretty much bite sized. For this entree he got the cascabel chile crusted rabbit. I wasn't very impressed with this dish. I've had rabbit before, and enjoyed it. But, the  rabbit here was very tough. This was the only dish the was a disappointment.   Overall, the service was impeccable, and the food overall was good!",

Maybe it was tinted by the fact that we had a few days of such wonderful meals elsewhere (Craftsteak at MGM for dinner and MOZen at the Mandarin for Sunday brunch were awesome) but this was really mediocre.   Lobster tacos were just fine, my husband had the salmon and had the same response. The best selection would be mine which was the vegetarian chili relleno and I'm not a vegetarian. It was very flavorful and crispy; we both liked it best. My $16 margarita was so tasteless I ended up not finishing it. We realize that when we come to Las Vegas it is expensive and we expect that. When we went to Craftsteak, we spent $300 including the tip (we don't drink much) and we felt it was well worth it. But we left Mesa after spending $150 with tip and felt robbed. The service was good though.",

I love chile rellanos when they're done right, and I thought to myself, \"who better to make a kickin' chile rellano than Bobby Flay?\"  So imagine my disappointment when my cornmeal crusted chile rellano had a dense, flabby crust that teetered on the edge of gross.  I'm not usually a sender-backer, but I made an exception here.    The S.O. had the coffee rubbed filet mignon, which I will say was cooked perfectly.  But if you're a person who likes subtle flavorings that allow the natural deliciousness of the protein to shine through, this is not the place for you.  The coffee rub was about as subtle as a smack with a two-by-four.  For the hefty price, meh.",

We enjoy sharing small plates so we chose from the appetizers and side dishes. Lobster tacos ($20 for 3 tiny tacos) were tasty but overpriced. \"Sofie's Salad\" was a major disappointment, anemic oxidized lettuce with canned beans and mealy chopped tomatoes, cold from refrigeration. Blue corn tamale side dish was like dry cornbread stuffed into a corn husk. Chile relleno and cauliflower gratin were the best dishes we tried but nothing special. I love coconut cake but Mesa Grill's version didn't have any coconut flavor, it really didn't taste like anything. The ambiance and service get 4 stars, the food 2 stars at best. A huge disappointment. Was it a bad night for the kitchen ? That shouldn't happen at a high caliber restaurant in Las Vegas.",

The peach margarita I got was very strong. Our table got great service. As other reviews mention, it's right by the sports betting area so you WILL hear loud cheering going on when touchdowns etc. are made--didn't bother us too much.  Food: quesadilla appetizer was delicious but beware it's filling. We tried one of the specials--Brussels sprouts with a marmalade dressing. Really tasty. We also got the sweet potato appetizer, SO good. Salmon we would pass on next time--it tasted unusually fishy. The toffee bread pudding was a perfect end to the meal. Would come back!",

    "text": "Being in Vegas makes me always want to do something up whether its betting high, hitting a good club, or splurging on a one damn good meal. This trip we chose to do it up by going to Mesa Grill because 1) we LOVE Food Network and 2) we enjoy watching Bobby Flay.   Upon arrival, we were greeted warmly by the host and within 5 minutes were seated. Our waiter then came to take our drink order and provided the house recommendations.   For drinks, we went for the Mesa Margarita which was very nice and refreshing.  For appetizer, we ordered the house specialty Blue Corn pancake with BBQ duck. It was VERY good and it made my wife a duck eater now which she wasn't before having experienced duck at another restaurant but didn't like so much. It had a great BBQ flavor and the blue corn pancake looked like a crepe and worked nicely together. It was great but $15 for one duck pancake was a little steep.   For entree, I ordered the house specialty Pork Tenderloin which was absolutely phenomenal. I'm so happy I ordered this dish because it was banging with flavor throughout the entire dish and every bite...melt in your mouth tenderloin!! Smokey and full of flavor!   My wife ordered the chipotle bone-in rib eye medium rare which she enjoyed but she definitely liked the pork tenderloin much better.    For a side, we ordered the roasted corn that had cotija cheese aka mexican cheese, a creamy sauce and OMG it was sooo DELICIOUS and a great compliment to our dishes. Again, lots and lots of flavor in this side dish!  We really enjoyed this restaurant and would definitely be back...after we try Gordon Ramsy's Steak restaurant. ;)",

    "text": "PRESSED CUBAN SANDWICH for the win! My friends and I came here on our last day in vegas for some good food. After seeing there were 752 reviews on yelp, 4 stars, we had to try it.  2 things I absolutely loved:  Pressed Cuban Sandwich - the patty is thick and SO JUICY!!!!! It has to be ordered a little pink, so be ready for that. Bobby Flay's thing is mixing up the spicy with the sweet, and sour. It's a perfect combination. I wasn't expecting to be blown away by southwestern food, but I really was. You also get to dip this delicious Cuban Sandwich into an aoili dip that makes the sandwich even better.  Not to mention, it comes with canjun fries which you don't even need ketchup for. Perfectly fried, crispy, crunchy and soft at the same time.  I also loved the: Spicy beef tenderloin tartare  (appetizer). It comes with a little potato salad that you can taste the quality in. The beef tartare has capers in it, and has a lot of flavor in it compared to other ones I've had at other places. It's truly delicious.   We also ordered: Rough cut tuna nachos - they were spicy, and it was a good portion to be shared amongst 5 people. It had mango sauce in it, I'm allergic to mango so I'm a little biased on this dish.  Spicy chicken + Potato hash - it's basically an eggs benedict, southwest style. My friend ordered it, and it was good, but it gets sickening after a while because of the hollandaise sauce. I wish they served this with some veggies on the side or something, just to balance it out.  Grilled swordfish sandwich - If you really liek the taste of cooked swordfish, then go for it, I wasn't really impressed with this.  Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich - served cold, but great flavors and the pork is soft. Surprisingly, it taste a lot better than it looks. However, it sounds a lot better than it tastes.   Thanks Mesa Grill, we'll be back on our next trip!",

    "text": "I haven't tried their dinner menu.  The 2-star rating is only for their lunch menu.  In summary, this has NOT met my expectation of how Tex-Mex should taste like.  I had much much better Tex-Mex food at San Antonio (Rosario's, for example).  I wouldn't not take another lunch at this place.  I ordered the aged tenderloin tortillas (~$24).  Thin sliced, and yes, the tenderloin was aged, great quality meat, nicely cooked to the way I want BUT the size was like... 4oz only?  The beef slices were occupying less than 1/4 the size of the dish and the rest was covered by chopped and diced mango, avocado, pickles, etc, and 4 tortillas each folded twice in a quarter circle.  Other than the tenderloin, the rest is about what you can get at Acalpulco or other local Mexican restaurants at half or cheaper price.  This make it an overpriced dish.  The BBQ Lamb Cobb Salad is good though.  Pretty strong lamb aroma and flavor from the meat and the goat cheese.  But other than that, I don't see how \"Tex-Mex\" this dish is.  The spicy chicken + sweet potato hash.... Nice sweetness as an appertizer dish but too sweet as an entree.    We liked the spiced pork tenderloin burger.  Served after seated, the muffins, corn bread, and the bite-size jalapeno biscuit were good, especially the jalapeno biscuits.   Finally there was something new and tasted good.  Again, this place does not live up to be a good \"Tex-Mex\" restaurant.  I would rather visit Texas again (if I found cheap flight deals) for real good Tex-Mex food.",

The Prix Fixe came with the Tapas and Shrimp which we shared, it was very good but we ate only the shrimp.  We were still full from lunch.  The shrimp was fantastic.  The Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin was so soft, so moist, so... OMG I've never eaten pork that is as nice that this.  Again, we didn't eat the tamale that came with this entree.  I'm very very impressed by this entree.  The coffee-rubbed filet mignon again was very juicy, very tender, and cooked just right.  The taste was very good although I must say the Pork beat the filet mignon because I think there are many others who can produce a filet mignon of the same quality but I doubt there are many out there that can produce a Pork tenderloin of the same quality.  I ran off to the airport without desert.  (:  I'll be back for sure.",

I can get better at my local taco stand. We had the churros for dessert and the delicate anise flavor was just right. It should be noted that I typically will avoid this flavor but in the churros, it worked. If you are looking for the best dang margarita you have ever had, then order the signature marg at Mesa....one will get ya going.

You know how most Mexican restaurants have a page on the menu for \"Combination\" dinners. We decided we wanted to create the ultimate Mexican restaurant combination dinner.  And we did! Two of us ordered threes dishes each and shared.  Blue Corn Lobster Tacos  Tiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale  Yucatan Chicken Skewers  Smoked Chicken and Black Bean Quesadilla Blue Corn Pancake Cornmeal Crusted Chile Relleno It would not be fair to compare this to any Mexican restaurant food. Every dish exploded with flavor combinations that were as good as anyone could expect food to taste. It's really hard to describe how unbelievable this meal was. To be honest, I would say that for a palate pleasing meal, this was probably as good as anything I have ever eaten anywhere. If this isn't my favorite dinner, it is in the top three. This dinner was orgasmic. (I know that sounds like hyperbole, but it was pretty close!)",

Tried the Black Widow mojito, and I didn't really love it.  The cola bit was a little strange, but I did like the grenadine in it.  I never got the famed bread basket :(.  Next was the blue corn pancake with the duck.  It was room temp, neither hot nor cold, which was confusing, and the duck was a little overdone.  Otherwise tasty.  Next was the New Mexico pork tenderloin.  It was really nicely cooked at a medium; the rub was tasty, but the spiciness took over my mouth and numbed it to the other tastes that were going on.  Dessert was the Autumn fruit tart with buttermilk pastry cream.  The pastry cream tasted only of regular cream and not buttermilk, and the fruit was nice and tender and not too sweet.    Nice spot to people watch, defintely.",

We still had to wait about 10 minutes but that is not out of the ordinary on a Saturday in Vegas.   The decor of the place is...unique. It's like some kind of post-modern-meets-old-southwest looks with colorful window tiles and earthy toned walls. Odd but cool. Anyways, the food was simply amazing. I can't remember anything I ate except for the Coffee Rubbed New York steak. That's because nothing else really mattered. It was a unique experience for steak and it was simply amazing. The sides that it came with were also amazing...wasabi mashed potatos and aspragus I believe. I loved it.  The one complain was with the service...it took our waiter about 40 minutes to bring us our check at the end of the night..which was enough to ruin it for most of group (I was still happy with the steak). Looking at other reviews, maybe this was a one-time blunder or a rare occurance, but I can only speak to what I saw.  Regardless...good center-Strip location the Caesar's...good decor...and awesome Bobby Flay food!",

Roasted pumpkin soup: creamy, smooth, and delicious. the pomegranate and pumpkin seeds were an especially nice touch. good contrast of crunchy seeds + velvety soup.  Blue corn pancake with bbq duck: if you've ever had Beijing duck and the sweet duck sauce in white bun, you'll have tasted this dish. my hard-to-impress asian mother was unimpressed and so was i. the sweet star anise sauce was too sweet and too lathered on.  grilled sea scallops: smells like THE SEA and i mean this in a bad way. the plate carried with it a horrible fish-y scent and doubt clouded my heart. luckily, the dish tasted pretty good. however, realize that the majority of this dish is comprised of glorified chips + guacamole  pulled pork sandwich: DO NOT GET THIS. DO NOT GET THIS. it tastes like it was mass produced and heated up from costco.   hazelnut ice cream + biscotti: pretty good but if you mess up ice cream, you pretty much fail at life.",

    "text": "I took my husband to Vegas for his 40th to fulfill two great desires - see Love (the Beatles Cirque du Soleil show) and eat at Bobby Flay's restaurant. I also made a reservation at the restaurant at the top of the Stratosphere which is one of the highest rated restaurants in Vegas. We canceled so we could eat at Mesa Grill again.   Yes Bobby Flay is all over Food Network, but he cooks to the flavor profile we prefer (and he's disdainful of Rachel Ray which makes me happy because she annoys the heck out of me).   Ambiance: Modern with an nod to the Old West. Good for a romantic dinner, a professional meal, or an upscale meal with friends. They also have a private dining room.   Service: Best waiter I have ever had in my life. He could speak intelligently about the menu in the way a hardcore foodie or critic could (an accomplishment in an establishment that frequently changes their menu). He was present when you wanted him, an absent when you wanted some privacy. He was awesome.   Food: Sex on a plate. In the realm of appetizers we had pumpkin soup and a lovely tartar plate of tuna and salmon with these AMAZING sauces. For entrees we had a 44 spice rubbed steak, lamb, chicken, and pork - all perfectly prepared and exquisitely seasoned. One of my favorite bites was a side dish of a sweet potato and chile tamale.   Pricing: Not cheap, but worth every dime. I've paid more for less enjoyable fare. I've rarely had more enjoyable food.   This place is in my list of top dining experiences of my lifetime. In fact, when we drive to New Mexico for the holidays, we are going to drive 4 hours out of our way just to eat dinner at Mesa Grill.",

Though I tried to converse and was just there to have a good time, the bartender had a more \"business oriented\" attitude, although it was really an empty bar.  Her tip reflected her attitude  The food, however, was fantastic.  First, they start by bringing a variety of complementary breads. I had three kinds, one with walnuts and cranberries and another an olive sourdough.  The lobster tacos, although extremely small, were satisfying with every bite.  The lamb porterhouse chops were incredible as well.  Cooked to perfection and the sweetness of the blackberry in the sauce is a great compliment.  I would have given it more stars if it weren't for the mediocre service.  Also, you definitely pay for what you receive.  No real bargains, but then again, this is Vegas baby!  Pay to play!",

I probably would have splurged more on apps, desserts, and drinks but after walking in deep in the hole from failed adventures at the craps table, blackjack table, sportsbook and an awesome trip to the spa, I stuck to the cornbread and my entree.  Regardless, everything I ate was delightful: the jalapeno cornbread, filet mignon with mushroom ancho-chile sauce, cornmeal crusted chile relleno, and cilantro pesto mashed potatoes.  The margaritas were also excellent and pretty strong...muy bueno!  I loved the colorful decor inside as well!",

Apparently, Bobby Flay as some music company in NYC that compiles the mix and puts it into an iPod and ships it to each of his restaurants regularly.  hmm, how do I intercept that shipment ....   As for the food.  I've been here both for dinner and Sunday brunch.  The food was good, but maybe I'm just not the TexMex kinda gal.  The brunch basket was really yummy, I wanted to take that with me.  The grits were also really good.  Actually, if I had just the bread basket and the grits I would have been just fine.  The goat cheese queso fundido was also fabulous.  Just make sure you don't let it cool down too much before you dive in.  I was really hung over, so the cactus pear ice tea with the liquid sugar was my poison of choice.  The spicy chicken + sweet potato hash was good, but I don't see me craving it.  Same with my dinner selection on a previous visit.  I ordered the New Mexican Spice Rubber Pork Tenderloin, it was good, but not very memorable.",

I thought it was kinda mushy and not really a \"hash\", and too sweet for my taste.  Gobs of tabasco didn't help much either.  I also had some of my cousin's egg scramble tortilla thing, which was ok as well.  Nothing to really rave about.  But the cheesy grits were soooooo good.  Had I known how good they were, I would've gave up on my entree and just ate the whole little bowl of grits.  I did like the goat cheese fondue with tortilla chips.  And my Bloody Mary was tasty and spicy, just the way I like it.  But overall?  I expected more from a Bobby Flay restaurant.  Maybe I'll go back to try dinner.",

Yes, the restaurant is gorgeous...but your jalapeno corn bread! So moist and flavorful. Sure the service is impeccable and impressive...but your appetizers! Did you get the recipe for the goat cheese queso fundito from the gods themselves? Did the idea for a wild mushroom quesadilla with truffle oil come to you in a moment of pure genius? Please. I can't even THINK about your stuffed squash blossoms or your corn. So simple in concept and yet executed with such brilliance, an explosion of flavor nearly knocks me unconscious. I could stop there but you have entrees. Unbelievably delicious entrees.   OK, Bobby, where is this crossroads in which you clearly made a pact with the devil at? Don't even TRY to deny such a deal was made. I have tasted your food many times. You cannot fool me!",

For my app, I had the Goat Cheese Queso Fundido.  OMG.  I could've eaten this all night long.  Smokey, melty, warmy goat cheese with those little charred bits clinging to the edge of the toasty-warm bowl.... and a nice serving of blue corn chips to make yourself more presentable when devouring the cheese.  For my entree,  I had the grilled mahi mahi with carmelized pineapple + green onion salsa.   Siouxie had the 16 spice chicken.  This is weird, but I totally loved the chicken way more than the mahi mahi.  The chicken took the flavors better.    The interior is warm, nicely done.    Get reservations.",

There definitely were highlights, but I can't say that I would go back. Here's the breakdown... Party of 3 on a Saturday night.    Grilled tiger shrimp special:  Great flavor and perfectly cooked.  Blue Corn Pancake (with BBQ duck):  Too much BBQ sauce, overpowers the flavor of duck meat  Cornmeal crusted chile relleno:  Best chile relleno i've ever had.  If you ever watch \"Throwdown,\" this is an example of how he takes a classic and modifies it to his own style.  Excellent flavor, texture, and heat.  Grilled Mahi Mahi:  Best main entree of the night.  Very light, flaky fish with a nice mango sauce.    To summarize:  Some great dishes, some not so much, and most of it too pricey.  (The price thing may be due to the fact that we ate at Buchon for ~30% less $$$ the night before).  Southwestern duck breast:  The southwestern sauce wasn't meshing too well.  The skin wasn't crisp.  Okay.  New Mexico pork tenderloin:  Again, nice dish but nothing spectacular.",

I came here before with a party of four and I think we actually had 2 orders for 4 people and we were able to finish it. The food here is all very intense and unique in flavor, maybe more than I'm used to. Don't come here expecting traditional Mexican food- you will be disappointed. Just come here expecting a lot of flavor.  This restaurant is always busy and one of the harder places to get a reservation in Vegas. The service is okay here, nothing spectacular, more on par with a semi-casual restaurant than fine dining.  I always find myself watching the cooks in the kitchen. They always seem to be hustling so I gotta give them props for that. Definitely a place I would recommend trying.",

    "text": "We attended a time share presentation and received $75 in restaurant vouchers that were valid at Mesa Grill. My wife loves Bobby Flay and wanted to eat here, so we did. We had to get a reservation more than 24 hours in advance, and the place was packed when we arrived.  While waiting for our table, I used the restroom. There was a little bit of \"number two\" on the toilet and on the wall! When I told the guy at the front desk he immediately called someone to have it taken care of. So that was impressive.  We sat and waited in a comfortable and contemporary couch. We were called almost exactly at our reservation time.  At our dining table, we were served bread which was unique and delicious. The corn meal muffin was slightly dry and very crumbly. We ordered a second basket of bread.  Entrees range from $32 to $50. Steaks are on the high end. We ordered Salmon and Duck. We did not have appetizers and we did not order drinks.  Both of our entrees were absolutely outstanding. The salmon was not farm. It was fresh, moist, fatty, and perfect. The duck was glazed, medium rare, and great  For dessert, we split a coconut crusted piece of cake. It was very light, and very sweet. Really good.   We left the restaurant stuffed and satisfied with great food. Total came to $85. I left $75 in vouchers, $10 cash, and another $15 tip. So $100 total for two dinners and one dessert. That's a little on the high side for me. I imagine the price would double if we'd had an appetizer, a couple of drinks and one extra dessert.  Only down side was the service. It wasn't bad, BUT for these prices you expect better and faster service. They should fill your water almost as soon as you are at 50%. They should pull out your wife's chair, and give you or napkin. They should take your empty plate faster, and take your empty bread basket faster. Just better attention would help a lot.  Overall, great experience, with opportunities in the waiter area.",

One tamale was $16 (I think), but it WAS good!  I thought there wasn't nearly enough sauce, so I asked for more, which the chef made up special for us at no extra charge.  I used half of the side of sauce and mmm'd my way to the last bite of that delicious appetizer.  My husband ordered the same tamale and before he was halfway through it, he called the server over to order a second one for himself.  The server brought my husband extra sauce without a second request!  Awesome!  We drank a delicious Cactus Pear Margarita with our \"dinner,\" which was trickily sweet... it went down VERY easy!  We split a third.  In all, we would go back for the tamale and margarita.  But the bill... ouch!  3 tamales & 3 margaritas added up to $100!  You'd better win a little gambling before eating here!",

    "text": "Lets start by saying that if I could give Mesa Grill 6 stars- I WOULD! Much to my surprise I see that many of my fellow yelpers did not have the same experience that I did! How unfortunate because I left Mesa dizzy with epicurean pleasure, and hey... I only had ONE glass of wine!  Last trip to Vegas we regretted not stopping in at Mr. Flay's so we were sure to pop in on our first night, while wandering the city. Still full off a ridiculous meal at The Burger Bar we opted for appetizers and drinks at the bar only. The bartender was friendly and knowledgeable about the food and I saw her whip a hot pink cocktail, something I have never seen.. I believe it was a cactus something or other... anyway we ordered some wine and 2 apps; Chicken Tacos and Goat Cheese Queso - WOW~ The food was so good, surely beyond my expectations!   In short, I can say we will absolutely hit up Mesa Grill each and every trip to Vegas!",

So I had high expectations and Mesa Grill did not disappoint. First of all, our waiter was excellent, although I forgot his name otherwise i would've gave him a shoutout on here.  He gave us some good recommendations and he really knew the menu.  Based upon his recommendation we ordered the duck pancake.  I've only had duck at Chinese and French restaurants, never at an American restaurant. The duck pancake was WOW!  It was in some type of BBQ sauce and the flavors just exploded in my mouth!  Thank you waiter! For the entree, I ordered the Mesa burger.  I figured Bobby Flay has a whole book on grilling, so he must make a mean burger!  My burger was succulent, juicy, huge, and oh so flavorful.  This could be one of the best burgers in Vegas?!  For $16 it was a deal!!  They are served with Southwestern fries, probably the best seasoned fries I ever had. For dessert, we had the chocolate bread pudding.  I'm a big fan of bread pudding regardless so it was a perfect way to end a perfect meal.  Thanks Bobby Flay for the keeping my taste buds satisfied.",

I have always been at odds with big celebrity chefs.  namely ones that are famous because of TV and not necessarily because the food network made him big -- like bobby flay. so i went with trepidation.  took the 9 girls in vegas for the weekend and i must say best meal of the trip!!  the space is open and modern, makes you almost forget you're in the middle of a casino.  everything i tasted from the girls around me to my own dish was awesome!  I guess flay really likes goat cheese, because it's all over the menu.  - scrambled egg enchiladas with chorizo:  a very simple dish but made complex by the delicious red chile sauce on the bottom, and the accompanied goat cheese and sprigs of cilantro made it a very well balanced dish!  could hardly taste the chorizo which was fine.  - tiger shrimp corn tamales: many girls at the table had this which was AMAZING!! apparently it is the specialty on the menu.  large shrimp in a cream sauce which was poured over an amazing corn tamale.  perfectly made and flavors spot on!!!  - spicy chicken with sweet potata hash: had a bite of this dish; basically it is a large mound of sweet potato with chicken cooked in, topped with a spicy hollandaise and a poached egg.  the one bite was pretty tasty.  others at the table had his burger which looked perfectly cooked.   overall a great experience.  we even had a few desserts - would definitely go for the espresso flavored flan?    do it! brunch. go.",

In fact all the food we ordered were fantastic and full of flavor.  My pork tenderloin was perfectly cooked and seasoned well.  The lemondrop martinis are also to die for.  The best lemondrop I have had.  I also tried the lemondrop with greentea infused vodka.  Although interesting sounding, the regular lemondrop was better. Service was okay.  A bit scatterbrain-ish and not as well synched with the servers and the busboys seemingly on different pages.  For example, the busboy started to take my plate away when I was only half done.  I guess I must have hesitiated in my efforts to finish the huge portions.  Then it took the server a bit to bring us the dessert menu....but overall service was friendly enough.",

We ordered the salmon and pork tenderloin for our entrees.  I personally thought the salmon was better.  Now that I think about it, I think I should have had a steak considering that's what you see Bobby Flay cooking on TV all the time.

I was tempted to cancel my entree and get another one of those! 16 spice chicken was loaded with flavor.

We had reservations for a 1:30 lunch on Satruday, when we called in, the person on the phone failled to mention that they were not serving any lunch or dinner entree's.. only breakfast.  Ok, fine, we'll make the best of it, it is afteralll Bobby Flay's place, I'm sure breakfast will be great....WRONG.  It was inedible!  I has the sweet potato hash with poached eggs and spicy hollandaise.  The hash was like no hash I've ever had before it was more like a puree.  It was mushy and wet and the sauce was, for a lack of a better word, yucky.  To top it all off the server didn't check on us once.  When he came to clear away my barely touched plate, he didn't even ask why it only had 2 bites taken out of it.  So many other things went wrong, but I won't go into it.    We did however go back for dinner the next day (fingers crossed) and it was back to it's old self.  You must get the yucatan chicken tacos (we ended up ordering 3 servings) and the sweet corn tameles with shrimp and the the special was crab and avacado something.. it was really good too and the service was much better.  A 1 point one day and 5 the next, so it's gets a 3. Moral of the review, don't go for breakfast/brunch here.",

The tamale had no Goat Cheese and was sticky and a glob of cornmeal. I asked the duck be cooked more and it took forever. The tables are so close together you may as well have just one big row of cafeteria tables like in grade school. I was cold, and the woman right next to me at another table commented twice to the waiter that the air could be turned down. We both asked. It remained cold. A young woman in a sundress sat down, after the cold middle aged woman left, I mentioned to her she might be chilly, and the waiter immediately offered her a SHAWL. Draped a lovely black shawl around her shoulders. Interesting. Under whelmed by the whole experience, I found it disappointing and overpriced. I recognized none of the dishes from the TV show. I'll not be recommending this restaurant .",

    "text": "This was the one thing I was really looking forward to in Vegas so my expectations were very high.  Three of us went for dinner with reservations at 5:45pm. I was the only one in our party that knew who Bobby Flay was.  I consider myself a foodie but the others not so much. The dinner menu was somewhat limited but to be expected if the food is done well. All en tree's were $35-$48 with the sides about $8 each (yeah, entree' does not come with sides.) OK, paying for a big name but not super expensive a la Robuchon. I wanted to try several different tastes from the menu so I ordered 3 appetizers at about $15-$18 each.  The bbq duck on blue corn cake was fantastic in a really sweet bbq way, however it was more like a tapa in that it was tiny and not enough to share a taste with my companions.  All the appetizers were really, really tiny - tapas style.  The mushroom quesedilla was unremarkable and so salty, I had to send it back.  I love salt so for me to send back a salty dish, it has to be nearly inedible. I have no idea how this could have happened. My companions had the salmon and she felt underwhelmed with the dish. The other had the rough cut tuna nachos which was basically like Hawaiian poke' served with a side of chips...tasted this and nothing remarkable in any way.  The bread was fantastic and interesting. The sauces were good.  The staff was attentive and professional. I left hungry and annoyed that I payed so much for unimpressive food. I think my companions were a bit annoyed with me for forcing them to go to Mesa.  Apparently, some folks here have had a good experience so maybe my expectations were too high.  Given this, I highly recommend having lunch or brunch here first as the prices are more reasonable.",

    "text": "Without price being an issue, the food was awful.  Taking price into consideration, the restaurant is an abomination.  I had the Black Grouper with avocado, which wasn't a great combination.  The avocado was a nice balance to the blackened flavors, but the meat itself was too bland to stand up to the flavor of avocado.  My wife had the pork tenderloin, which was awful in flavor and texture.  The baked potato side ($8) was the worst of it all.  I seriously would have preferred a baked potato from Wendy's.  It was terribly overcooked.  The wine list was bizarre and overpriced.  I work for a wine distributor, specializing in the restaurant industry, so I am familiar with the general price levels of many of the wines on the list.  The markups were higher than I have ever seen before.  The by-the-glass selection was limited to only about 8 wines, and many were indigenous European varietals or other obscure grapes that don't have a place on such a small by-the-glass list.  There was also a serious shortage of merlots by-the-bottle, which I thought was odd since at least a third of the menu would have paired greatly with a merlot.  I think the wine director probably watched a little too much Sideways.  I also thought it was interesting that the servers don't really do anything at Mesa Grill.  He introduced himself, took our order, and brought our check...literally nothing else.  After we finished, he asked us if we were done with our plates (presumably so he could take them away).  When we said yes, he politely said he would send someone to get them in a few moments and quickly walked away.  Bottom line, my wife and I spent $130 on 2 entrees, 1 side, 1 beer, and 1 cocktail (I couldn't bring myself to order wine from such an awful selection).  After this, I'm even more certain that the concept of superstar chefs is a joke.  They work so hard to be original and the end result is food that's just not very good, but very expensive nonetheless.  You would be much better off getting the steak and eggs across the street at Bill's for $5.99.",

The bar was mostly full, waited behind a woman who was buying 5 margarita's and she stood there sipping on one for some reason while her friends sat a table. Luckily 3 seats became available at the other end and the 2 of us sat. And waited and then waited some more. The bartender on our side never once acknowledged us. Not even a glance for almost 10 minutes. She was getting a bottle of wine for man to take out somewhere. Going into detail about how she could not give him the Mesa glasses. I understand helping customers but sometimes a small glance to let one know you exist is all it takes for good service.I don't mind waiting but I do want to know we will be served at some point. But after 10 minutes of sitting there when she only had the 2 of us, the wine customer who already had his wine and a single man who was already served well that is not acceptable so we left. I am certain she did not notice or care but her attitude made me question another visit.",

    "text": "First of all it was awesome to be able to eat at one of Bobby's Flay's restaurants. Secondly, the restuarant did NOT dissapoint.  What we ordered:  1. tuna tartare nachos- the tuna was so incredibly fresh. The sauces and chips that accompanied the dish were so flavorful.  Only complaint is that the tuna seemed a tad bland.. like it needed to be accompanied with avocado chunks or a little more seasoning to break up the texture of the big chuck pieces of tuna.  2. chicken tacos- that peanut BBQ sauce was HEAVENLY. The grilled red onions were perfection. I would definitely order this again and would love to learn how to make that peanut sauce at home.   3. the shrimp corm tamale- honestly, it was good but not amazing. The corn pieces were so sweet and plump, one of the best corn I have ever had but the tamale itself wasnt that great.  4. Lamp Chops- AMAZING, OUSTANDING, INCREDIBLE. One of the best lamp chops I have ever had. I highly reccomend them.  5. Filet Mignon with Coffee Rub- Such an amazing combination. The flavor of coffee with high quality meat just melts in your mouth. Such cool flavors. Such a nice feeling when you think to yourself that you have never tasted anything like this before. We also ordered the mashed potatoes to accompany this dish and those were just heaven. Creamy, buttery goodness.  Very nice romantic meal in Vegas with the boo. I would definitely like to come back here.",

More specifically when ordered with the rough cut tuna nachos, absolutely the best thing on the menu. Order it!  Not too pretentious, fairly casual, great place to stop for a quick drink while walking thru Caesar's.  Cant say the entrees are anything really great, but they are good. I've had cioppino for dinner and the shrimp tacos for lunch. Had better for less cheddar, but they are still good dishes and the vegas vig on food is expected.   All in all, try this place as you are walking thru the maze of caesar's palace trying to find your way to the forum shops.  Have a margarita AND the tuna nachos at the very least.",

    "text": "Service was great, we were greeted as we walked in and immediately taken to our table without any wait whatsoever. This is what I expect when we put down a $100 deposit to keep our reservation, the promise to show on time has to be honored by both parties right? We were greeted along the walk to our table and our server immediately introduced herself to us. She was very pleasant with taking our order, timing was perfect for the intervals between each visit to the table. She wished my fiancee a happy birthday multiple times (I mentioned it when I made the reservation).  We started trying some bread from the basket. I personally loved the jalapeno bread, not every bite had chunks of jalapeno in it, but every bite had the flavors. The blue corn bread was also good. I tried the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin. When it first came out I thought the portion of meat was a bit smaller than I expected, however as I progressed through the meal, the portion was actually perfect and I typically eat a decent volume of food. The meat was cooked perfectly, so juicy. The side of sweet potato tamale was ok, didn't add much to the dish though. My fiance had the coffee rubbed filet mignon. The meat was tender and well seasoned, although the coffee taste was very very subtle if noticeable at all. The mushrooms in the sauce added to the flavors. She also had a white peach margarita, this was delicious. Has the tartness you would expect from a margarita but the added aromas of white peach made it much more enjoyable.   Decor was fitting for the southwestern style that Bobby is known for. We wanted to try this place since it's the only US location open as of now, ever since the flagship in NY had been recently displaced. However, considering all the other celebrity chefs that have restaurants available in LV, we probably will not be back anytime soon until we've had the opportunity to experience some of the other options. Worth 1 try though!  TIP: only come if you have made reservation, otherwise the wait seemed to be quite long as we walked out from our meal.",

I've never had one before, but I was scurred it was going to be overwhelmingly cheesy. I was impressed that it wasn't! Maybe it's because they use manchego cheese, not something too heavy. The crispy cornmeal outside was a nice touch and the sauces complimented the overall taste.  Yum and yum.  The only bad things was we went for lunch, so the menu was very limited. There were 8-10 appetizers and 6-8 entrees and that's it.   The other limiting factor is there was only that one vegetarian dish so.. technically I didn't have any other entree option.",

So they very kindly made me one of those offerings with vodka instead. When I noticed my knife wasn't clean and looked over for my waiter, I realized he was standing just a couple of yards away, awaiting my call. He swiftly came to my aid, and went to find me another knife. On his way back, I saw him thoroughly inspecting the new one. When he saw that it wasn't perfect, he ran back to grab a third. So funny and awesome at the same time.   I ordered the pork tenderloin, and ate every last bite. The sweet potato tamale was a special treat. Of the sides, I think the corn was my favorite. The recipe isn't something I've tasted before, and it was tasty! Of course, everything was pretty pricey, but if I had the budget, I could definitely see myself returning.",

As the night went on it felt like our waiter was forgetting about us. The service got really slow and we waited nearly an hour for our entrees. I had the lobster tacos and they were delicious. I tasted the grilled chicken and it was not good at all. For dessert we had the blueberry cobbler with ice cream. The ice cream was melted and it just all around wasn't very good.   We were there for over 2 hours not by our own choice. Some food was great some was not so good but ultimately the service is what ruined it for me, especially since it started off strong. I probably wouldn't come back.",

Service was attentive, but not intrusive, just right. Water always filled. No long wait for ordering, service, cleaning, or bill.   Bread basket was full of VERY moist and warm biscuits, muffins, bread. The Jalapeno muffins were a perfect little mouthful! We had the Queso Fundido which was delicious, cheesy, velvety. A nice start.  Buttermilk waffle was flavorful, warm, with a crispy exterior. Bourbon sauce was good. I usually ask for maple syrup. But this waffle and sauce was so sweet none was needed.  Spicy scrambled eggs were cooked well with a nice flavor profile, but not near spicy enough to have \"spicy\" in the name. Change the name and it is a 9. But I expected more spice from a SW type cooking.  A tip I would give is to put a HOT margarita on the menu. This is SW after all.  Overall we really liked Mesa, and will be back again.",

    "text": "We kicked off Restaurant Week 2010 at Mesa Grill. When we arrived at 5 o'clock there were very few diners, I'm pretty sure it was just us and two other couples. But as our meal went on the dining room quickly filled. We noshed on the bread basket while we waited for our appetizers, the blue corn muffin wasn't too appealing the bottom looked moldy. The fruit bread was the favorite, and I expected to like it least.  Then, we got started on our first course: Roasted Corn Soup Smoked Tomato Salsa and Blue Corn Pancake Barbecued Duck + Habanero Chile-Star Anise Sauce. The soup was decent it had an unusual hint of flavor, I thought squash maybe, but my husband thought it tasted more like seafood. Obviously, we weren't on the same page. The blue corn pancake and duck were very tasty. Again, the blue corn does nothing for its appearance.  For the main course we had Blue Corn Crusted Halibut with Salsa Cruda, Sweet 100 tomatoes, capers, jalapeno, Fresh Oregano, Basil and New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin Bourbon -Ancho Chile Sauce Sweet Potato Tamale Crushed Pecan Butter. The fish was nicely prepared, the presentation was different - thanks to the blue corn it looked liked it had asphalt glistening off the filet. The pork was flavorful as long as you had the crust in every bite. The tamale was unlike your traditional tamale, still tasty, however.  Lastly we finished with Coconut Layer Cake and Banana Cream Pie. Both were good, but nothing particularly memorable.  Service was very good throughout the meal. All in all, it was a fine meal, it's just that nothing was particularly notable. I can't say I'd return, but I'm happy we took the opportunity to finally give it a try.",

The bf & I walked in at 10:30m p.m. without a reservation & were seated promptly. The restaurant was still about 30% full.

After a day of watching sports in an electric environment it is a luxury to be able to sit down for an extraordinary dinner without missing a beat.   The food is classic Bobby Flay. A mix of NYC and Southwestern flavors balanced to perfection. The interior of the restaurant is modern and chic, but not overly formal.

    "text": "Overpriced and overhyped for what you get.   We arrived at 6 pm and the place was half-full (optimism).  We asked for a table for two, \"You'll need to come back at 8:30 pm\" was the response. Why we couldn 't be seated then was mind-boggling considering we were the only ones in line to get a table.  When we did return we were seated promptly just to the right of another couple.  I could have put my hand in his back left pocket if I wanted - we were that close.  Not very romantic - \"pack 'em in and churn them out\" was the feeling I got.    I ordered a 22oz steak for a cool $48. You'd think for that price you'd get a side of some sort - nope, nada - that's an extra $9. The steak was big and looked appetizing and was prepared well with a nice char on the outside. After a few bites it was soon evident that this piece of meat was fattier than the kid in the new Ted movie. Maybe 1/3 of it was edible. My partner ordered the chicken breast - it was better than my meal because of the balsamic glaze, but nothing special.  The best thing we had was the appetizer, cheese fondido.  The sweetness of the chilies combined with the creaminess of the goat cheese was very delightful.  Add to the so-so food that the restaurant is in the casino  allowing the stench of chain-smoking gamblers to overpower the smoke from the grill in the kitchen and you have a big fat failure - just like my steak.   Bobby might want to have a throwdown with himself and reinvent that menu, and the ambiance.  Save yourself the time and money.",

Deep dish banana cream pie-Like eating a cloud of banana with a delicate brittle cookie delight. Interesting and tasty cocktails. Our server was the nicest most helpful guy.

Thank goodness we came here because it was awesome! We came here for brunch and the staff all greeted us with warm smiles and immediately we were seated. We came in around brunch time so we had the brunch menu. I ordered the spicy scrambled eggs and my friend ordered the blue corn buttermilk waffles but before all this came an assortment of bread. All of the breads were warm, soft, and delicious! Both entrees  were outstanding. The ham egg and biscuits in the scrambled eggs were phenomenal and the Waffle was crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside, and the portions and prices were extremely good. The waiters and waitresses were also awesome and always refilled water and bread without us asking. It was definitely worth the 40 dollars we paid for such good food. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas and this place does not disappoint!",

    "text": "This place was pretty fantastic. Thank you Bobby Flay for bringing your food creations into this world.   Started out my meal with the tiger shrimp tamale...sensational. I have never tasted anything like it or even heard or anything like it. I was pleasantly surprised by its taste, which was a little sweet with the tamale and savory because of the taste of the shrimp. Perfect flavor and unique combination.   Ordered the lamb porterhouse chops. The flavor of the lamb was also a little sweet but over all delicious. This is where I had to take a star off though - the lamb was over cooked. I had asked for medium and received medium well. I didn't complain because the seasoning was delicious, but I would hope that a place that capitalizes on grilling would grill meat how they said they would. We spoke with the waitress afterward and she said that some of the cooks in the back were getting orders that were either overcooked or undercooked. I don't care how amazing the flavors are...that isn't cool.   The service here was exceptional, I came here with a large group and there were no mix ups with our orders and they knew exactly what they were doing. Friendly staff who were willing to listen to us and really cared if we liked the food. One person in our party had a steak that was very overcooked and before he mentioned anything the waitress saw his disappointment and had a new dish made up for him. My dish wasn't bad enough to send back and I was starving by that time so not too much complaining about my lamb.",

Our waiter was a dick (wish I knew his name so you could avoid his douche-ness) and the menu was less than innovative. Watching Bobby on TV, you'd think his dishes would have a little more spunk and creativity involved but it was all just blah.   -Goat Cheese 'Queso Fundido': Very good, but then again how hard is it to screw up melted cheese? Not super creative or special.  -Chile Relleno: 'cornmeal crust' was very dry, pepper was undercooked and tough, sauce was only redeeming part.  -Coffee Rubbed Filet Mignon: If you don't like cumin, you will hate this. It's LOADED on the outside with cumin like someone dumped a whole spice jar of it on there (which I hate and wasn't mentioned or I wouldn't have ordered it). Mushroom-Ancho Chile Sauce is VERY spicy and I like spice. Between cutting off the outside to avoid choking on the cumin and not being able to eat most of the mushrooms, it was wasted. It was, however, cooked perfectly as I ordered it medium.   We didn't have cocktails, only wine so I can't speak about the mixed drinks. The whole experience was a total letdown. There are so many better places in Vegas... would not waste my time or money on this one again.",

We started with the Rough Cut Tuna Nachos, which were not bad, pretty tasty, and with a little bit of a habanero kick. Since our dinners were taking a bit of time, we also had an amuse bouche courtesy of the chef. It was a similar tuna appetizer.   For main course, I ordered the 22oz bone in Chipotle Glazed Rib-eye. It was cooked to perfection. The only thing I didn't like was that they don't really let you have it your way. I like my steak a little more rare, but they suggest that you have it medium, as that is the chef recommendation. Nevertheless, the medium was good.   I polished the whole thing down and then... for sides there was the roasted corn with grilled cactus, lime and cotija. This by far is THE BEST THING on the menu. While we got other sides... we only really finished this one and were licking the bottom of the bowl it came in.  For dessert we had some delicious churros and a cake that I can't remember now. But the churros really stood out.   Overall a great tasty experience. I would go back for the corn alone.",

    "text": "My boyfriend had previously tried this restaurant, as had my mom's coworker, and both parties said this place was great!  I've always wanted to try this restaurant since then.  My family and I were lucky in that we happened to come during the Las Vegas Restaurant week, which means a special menu for a good cause.  For appetizer,  I ordered a blue corn pancake, which was BBQ duck inside a crepe, drizzled with habinero sauce and something sweet.  It wasn't spicy like I anticipated but instead very sweet.  It was also paired with arugula, which was so delicious.  Another thing to mention, the bread that Mesa Grill gave before the meal was very unique.  There were 3 different kinds, one being a cheesy one, another one was a cornbread.    My entree was the pork tenderloin that was mentioned in Zagat, so I had to try it.  I really enjoyed it; the pork was very tender, and had a good flavor to it.  I remember finishing almost all of it, which was pretty difficult. It also came with a sweet potato tamale, which I also liked just because it was so different.  Super tasty, but after a point you can only take so much starch!  For dessert, I had the mixed berry creme brulee.  This dish was lovely; not too sweet, super silky, and not too floppy.  Service of this restaurant was probably one of the best I've ever had.  I remember my dad had just finished sipping his Coke, and right as he placed the empty cup on the table, our waiter was behind him handing him another Coke!  Also upon entering the restaurant, there were about 5-6 waiters just on \"stand-by\" waiting on the stairs, which stood out to me.  The only reason why I wouldn't give 5 stars is because I'd probably not go back.  Wasn't my type of restaurant, I'm not too big on Southwestern food.  More of a personal thing than a Bobby Flay issue.",

    "text": "BY FAR ONE OF THE BEST DINING EXPERIENCES IN MY LIFE. Unforgettable!  Even if Will Smith \"flashy thinged\" me like in Men In Black.. I would remember the pear cactus margarita and the rabbit entree I had at Mesa Grill.  The flavors are unlike anything your average home cook can put together. AND THAT MY FRIENDS is why people should be dining out in the first place. How many times do you go out to eat and think \"I can make this at home\". I know I do, a lot! Most of the time its about being waited on and the atmosphere. Well at Mesa Grill, it is about all of the above.   The duck quesadilla was split and I literally only got one bite (as did the other 2 at the table with me) but it was so worth it. All of our eyes lit up when we put the fork into our mouthes. The coffee rubbed steak, the pork tenderloin as well as my rabbit was all so delicious.  Word to the wise: just dont cancel your reservation, there is a $75.00 fee if you need to cancel the day of past 3 pm. We didn't, just were warned. :)",

    "text": "I went to Mesa Grill last Sunday. It's a good space with friendly wait staff. The food didn't impress me though.   My favorite part of my 3-course meal was the roasted corn soup. Strange, but True. It had a great consistency and a strong corn flavor with some heat.  For my entree, I had the spicy chicken salad. There just wasn't anything particularly good about the salad - and trust me, I've had salads that wow me with their ingredients.   For dessert, I had the upside down pineapple cake.  The sauce was tasty and so was the pairing of ice cream with the warm dessert, but it just seemed like an afterthought.   As I said, if I ever had to eat at Mesa again, I'd get the roasted corn soup, but I don't intend on going back in Vegas or elsewhere.",

There were some hits and misses but overall this is a place that me and the fiance would like to frequent more often. I have yet to try their burger but the fiance likes it very much. I tried their famous blue corn pancake barbequed duck, It was quite a long time ago so I dont remember the flavors distinctly but I was not impressed (obviously if I can't even remember how it tasted) It was forgetable at best. I do remmeber the Bacon Hash Brown quesidilla being scrumptious however and we ravaged the dish. Recently I had the sweet potato Hash, it was a mix of spicy and sweet mixed in one. It wasn't the type of spicy I particularly like ( it was more of a Kick type of spicy). I give it four stars despite the misses because the taste is innovative and unique to the palette so its quite enjoyable.",

We went for the bf's birthday as fans already of Bobby Flay and thought it would be good but are happy to say it was GREAT.   To start we each got a margarita only because it is their specialty drink .... Yum. Wow! And for apps the fundito quest and duck pancake which were both truly fantastic and recommended by our server as favorites. The quest dip was hot and spicy and gooey ... Served on a little skillet, bubbling at the table, we smiled big. \"CHEESE.\" For supper he got the rabbit and I got pork. From the cornbread at the table to my side in a cornhusk .... To the most tender pork I have ever had to the delightful rabbit, we could not have asked for more.   A funny thing that did happen, just to show the service level, I thought I had found a hair in my meal. It wasn't touching anything, so I just asked to be replated. Well, they came back with a whole new meal and it was from the cornhusk .... Not a human. I kinds felt bad but honestly didn't know. What struck me was there wasn't a second thought to creating a new dish even at my request not to. They aim for excellence and surely got it.   Love to Bobby Flay and Mesa Grill team. Thanks for making the boyfriend's birthday perfect. We will be back and send all of our Vegas friends.",

Just the corn for side order is the best corn on a Cobb I've ever had. A must! The spiced rub pork tenderloin? Ahhhh! So good!!! I love this place.

In fact, if I were on death row and the time had come to request my last meal, I used to be the In N Out double double animal-style.  Chef Bobby Flay's Green Chile burger trumps In N Out in every way. Finally, a restaurant burger that's actually worthy of being called a restaurant burger. This burger is just bursting with awesome juicy flavor. So damn good. I'm going to get it every time I'm in town now.  Oooh. Also the goat cheese queso fundido is probably the best appetizer I've ever had too. Can't recommend it highly enough!",

All appetizers ranged from $11-16, and entrees from $30-50.     I had the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin.  this was served with Bourbon-Ancho Chile Sauce and a sweet potato tamale with pecan butter ($36).  OMFG.  It was pretty damn good.  Pork was cooked perfectly...medium.  Nice crust on the outside, tender on the inside.  The sweet potato tamale was delicious.  It reminded me of a new take on cornbread.  My husband ordered the Sixteen Spice Crusted Chicken ($32).  This was accompanied by a mango-garlic sauce and mango salsa.  The chicken was very tender-not dry at all.  And the mango sauce and salsa went perfectly well with the chicken.   Mesa Grill was a good food experience, and I'm glad I gave it a try.  Good food, great service, and a wonderful atmosphere.",

Appetizers we fine, nothing special. When the main courses were delivered, two (of 6) went back for being under cooked. I really can;t express how disappointed we were.

Ok, setting aside my prejudice against him as much as I can, I would say my meal was decent. I ordered the seven spice chicken or something that effect. I really couldn't note the complexity of the spices in this dish. I definitely was expecting something that tasted a little louder and had more depth. I did notice that my friend's husband had an amazing looking pork dish that I almost stole. I think if I tried that dish I would give this place at least a four. Based on my chicken, I'd have to say this place was a 3.5, but I'd be willing to go back, amend my review and give Mr. Flay another chance. I mean, aren't we all jackasses one time or another?",

My wife, son & I stopped in mostly for dessert, but my 20-year-old son was hungry for something special, because our earlier fabulous sushi dinner wasn't quite filling enough. He debated with himself over the menu, as my wife & I took the opportunity to order drinks. The Especial Margarita, with a Gand Mariner floater was top notch, according to my wife, the perfect Margarita snob. I had the Bitter Frenchie, a grapefruit drink that you should never mistake for a Margarita! So, along comes the moment of truth for my son, who is torn between so many items - the waiter staring him down for a food order. I told the waiter that my son eats everything, and especially appreciates creativity in food. The waiter didn't miss a beat - \"Do you like lamb?\" \"Yes!\" \"Order the lamb porterhouse!\" \"Yes! Medium rare!\" When it arrived, My son took one bite, his eyes grew big and he smiled. Best lamb ever! I tasted it. No gaminess. Slight char. A light layer of delicious Argentinian chimichurri and just enough tiny slivers of cooked serrano peppers to give it a little punch. Quite possibly as delicious and perfect as any steak anywhere! Seriously. The lamb was served with a plantain tamale which, like at most restaurants, had way too much corn masa and not nearly enough filling. My wife & I ordered the banana cream pie dessert. Creatively done. No real crust, just a sliver thin cookie crust-like layer balanced on top of the pie filling. Not too sweet. Very good, but not overly memorable. Overall, Mesa is definitely worth going back for to see what other interesting things they have in store for us.",

    "text": "I usually like my reviews to be short and concise but this evenings experience needs details.  My wife and I were always fans of Bobby Flay from the recipes he creates on The Food Network and were anxious to try the real thing. We did not have a reservation(I recommend that you do).We arrived at 4:40pm, 20 minutes before their advertised opening time. After being told we could not get a table until 10:00 pm, they offered us a seat at the bar were we able to order from there. This is where our evening began to become exceptional.  Our bartender/waiter Efren, outside of the food was to become our highlight of the evening. As always when dining at a new restaurant I rely heavily on our server for recommendations. Efren was perfect from our cocktail (margarita) to and including our dessert. His patience, warm personality and ability to find exactly what we would enjoy was \"spot on\".  We started with a classic margarita where our servers inquisition of our tastes paid off. A little pricy but well worth it. (Fresh squeezed lime juice and a generous pour)   First course from the appetizer menu:BARBECUED RIBS with Peanut Chipotle Sauce + Green Onion - Peanut Relish $15. SOUTHWESTERN SPICE CHICKEN SKEWERS Mint, Butter Lettuce, Cilantro + New Mexico Chile Sauce $15. Shared we both loved the flavours. My wife thought the ribs could have been a little more juicy. The chicken was served with small corn tortilla wraps to make some small soft taco from the chicken skewers. Our main course, again shared: GRILLED LAMB PORTERHOUSE CHOPS Blackberry - Cascabel Barbecue Sauce + Collard Greens with Smoked Chiles $44 and ANCHO CHILE-HONEY GLAZED SALMON Spicy Black Bean Sauce + Roasted Jalapeno Crema $32 with sides Roasted Corn Chipotle Aioli, Lime +Cotija Cheese, Mashed Potatoes + Green Chile Queso Sa.... perfection.  Could it get any better? I was excited to try a Bobby Flay dessert. Known for his use of chocolate and spice I had to have the Sticky Toffee Pudding. Not really a pudding but more of a cake and not on the advertised Menu. Sweet, salty and oh so good.  If you are like me and usually avoid reading lengthy reviews and skip to the last summation...Eat Here! Do not be afraid to sit the bar and tell Efren I sent you.",

They do show an open kitchen and will show you the cuts before they put them on the grill.  They have different chefs given their own specialties (steak, seafood, ect).  The 4-star rating is only because it took about 30-45 minutes to get our main entrees.  The rest of the service was quick though.  I will definitely go back!",

    "text": "Three of us went about a month ago. Each time I am in Vegas I choose one or two \"name\" restaurants to visit - there are so many and I love good food. Plus, I need to wean myself off going to Bouchon EVERY trip. Creature of habit, but I wasn't giving the other places their fair try.  On this Saturday, we were able to make a reservation that day for dinner at 9:00PM. When we arrived it was pandemonium at the front desk. People were coming in in droves for their reservations. You know - it's the usual Vegas name-restaurant-at-big-hotel crowd - older tourists mixed with throngs of youngsters dressed-to-kill-and-get-laid in an anonymous place. The young people hang out in gangs - gangs of 6-8 girls, gangs of boys. Gaggles? Gangs? Anyway, it's fun to people watch but these large groups of giggling 21-year olds in nearly identical mall outfits and 5-inch heels can get tiresome. At least they keep Vegas pumping.  Even though we had the reservation, many folks were seated ahead of us. We asked the vacant-eyed girls at the front desk when we would be seated and they vaguely answered that they were doing their best.  Finally I had to go up and grill one of the gals and told her we were feeling neglected and unhappy. She finally busted a smile and let us know that Bobby was in the house and people weren't leaving their tables and they were waiting for a \"four-top\" and yada-yada. Moments later our four-top opened up and we were seated.  Everything changed after that. I ordered a cocktail to relax. Bread came - bread I normally don't touch. A basket of warm, aromatic bread. Oh, jeez, okay I'll eat some bread. Anyway, I had a 4-hour hike that afternoon and I deserved some carbs. Holy cow, people. It was the best bread I've ever had - the sourdough baguette with flecks of jalapeno pepper - sublime. I don't even LIKE sourdough bread. I liked this bread. Very much. I was relaxed and happy now. The service staff was attentive.  We ordered queso dip and quail appetizers. The delicate little quail were served on a schmear of red pepper sauce. Divine. I sucked on the bones. In public. The goat cheese queso dip was delicious. I shared the apple salad - too big.  I had the venison - the most perfectly-cooked venison I've ever had. Rare but not pulpy slices sitting on a piquant reduction sauce. Outrageously good. Husband had the lamb posole and our friend had the coffee-rubbed filet mignon. All good. Everyone happy.  We would definitely return to try more of the menu.   My only complaint was the host/hostesses - they need more training on how to handle crowds and keep people happy. More personable people need to be hired.",

They were both fantastic. The wait was really long, so I simply ate at the bar. The service was impeccable. If you like fine food and want a twist on the Southwestern genre, don't miss Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill.  If I could give 4.5 stars I would only because I think it's a bit on the expensive side but that's because Flay's gotta maintain his status and really I can't blame him since the food is a cut above the rest.",

    "text": "This place is amazing. I make my way to Caesar's Palace to eat here every (and I mean every) time I'm in Las Vegas. The service is excellent, the decor is updated and modern, the food never disappoints, and I am always eager to go back.  I always order the Tiger Shrimp Tamale and there is never a bite left over. I sometimes order it as my lunch entree because it's a decent portion that perfectly hits the spot for me. Other delicious things I have tried are the Ancho-Chile Honey Glazed Salmon (yum!) and the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin which was very rich but also very delicious. Everything I've had was top notch which is why I keep going back.   This restaurant is 5 star quality but not necessarily 5 star budget. Lunch is less expensive, and dinner is understandably more. Entree's run anywhere from $15-$50, depending on when you go and what you get. If you want to do it cheaper, definitely go for lunch. If you want to get fancy, you can easily run a tab over $150 for two people with appetizers, drinks, dessert, etc. Basically what I'm trying to say is that you CAN eat here on a budget, so don't let the menu intimidate you. When we get the salmon and tiger shrimp for lunch, my fiance and I usually slide out at around $50 with tax and tip included, which is basically just as expensive as buying ribs at Applebee's.  The only critique I would have on this place is that sometimes you sit a little too close to your neighbors. But the food is so good, it's not enough to knock it down a star.   *SIDE NOTE:* You have to remember that eating Bobby Flay's food is like a Food Network experience for your taste buds. You must eat all of the things on your plate TOGETHER. It's all about the different sauces and blending of flavors. Especially when I ate the pork, it was very rich, but when I added it together with the other things on my plate, it totally mellowed out some flavors and added something new! It was like a flavor epiphany.",

    "text": "My one big tip: note that on Saturdays and Sundays, they only have the brunch menu, and do not serve the lunch menu. Worth noting, as I was hoping to get the Pork Tenderloin, and my wife was hoping to get the pressed Cuban burger- neither was available on the brunch menu.  That being said, holy crap so good. I watch Top Chef regularly, but I'm not the most adventurous eater out there (don't like seafood, I'm weird like that). So what I liked most about this place is that the food has the quality, taste and presentation you'd expect from a professional, but it's all riffs on food you already know and like.  The highlight was definitely the breakfast quesadilla- two very crispy tortillas with bacon, cheese, hash browns, chiles and onion goodness, with salsa and an egg on top to crack and let the yolk run over it (not usually my thing, but worked great here). Just layer upon layer of flavor and texture.  With the lunch menu unavailable, I got the pork tenderloin sandwich and my wife got their standard burger. The fries were actually the highlight, very crispy and well seasoned with a unique smokey flavor. My sandwich was very good, but not at the level of the quesadilla (same with my wife's burger).  All this said, I can't wait to come back and get the dishes we were hoping to get from the lunch menu. If you're a steak and potatoes kind of guy but want to try something that looks and tastes more gourmet, this is the place to visit.",

The server was great and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time.  Dishes: Rough cut tuna \"nachos\": This was a very tasty dish.  You get a lot of tuna, and it was very fresh.  The sauces at Mesa are all delicious.  None of it was too spicy (I love spicy, g/f not so much).  Blue Corn Pancake: I personally liked the nachos better.  There was nothing wrong with the pancake, it was good, just not as good as the tuna.  New Mexican Spiced Rub Tenderloin: This was the best tenderloin I've ever had.  I'm not exactly sure how they get it so tender with so much flavor.  Our waitress said it was the most popular (and spicy) dish on the menu.  It was moderately spicy but extremely delicious.  Fire Roasted Veal Chop: This had excellent flavor and another highly recommended dish.  It was large, tender, and the char on it was perfect.    Roasted Corn Side Dish: Another delicious dish.  We were told this was a summer only dish which is sad because I would say it ties or beats Joe's Steak and Crab for the best I've had.   Banana Cream Pie: For dessert we had the banana cream pie.  It was an interesting take on the classic and was very good.  It wasn't heavy which made it nice after eating the previous dishes.  We also both got specialty cocktails which were excellent.",

The overall experience is best described as \"Southwestern Light\" several of us kept yearning for more spice and most of the food frankly was fairly bland. We came as a party of 5 - the waiter was very attentive however our entrees took forever and just as another reviewer has mentioned the table next to us sat down and seemed to have theirs immediately. My margarita was alright, nothing special and a bit on the weak side for a \"high end\" restaurant I could have probably gotten the same right outside in the casino. We chose appetizers based on previous reviews and these were delicious as were most of our desserts. Our entrees however when finally delivered were a huge disappointment - my chili relleno was awful - it practically oozed with so much cheese I couldn't find the chili in there and the chicken was basically no better than business class airplane food. Entrees were so terrible I don't think any of us will be back. If you are just going for the name then you probably won't care otherwise I would save your money and go a few doors down to the cafe at Spago.",

I'm really disappointed with Bobby Flay. We ordered the wine, they bring to the table, then bring to the back to open - not cool.  The next bottle, I questioned them  about this (I'm not a wine snob / foodie snob, but my wife went to J&W so I've learned to recognize right from wrong over the years).  I also travel extensively for sales throughout the US and internationally.  I've had more than my fair share of steaks. The next bottle he opens at the table and pours the taste into a white wine glass - strike two. There was plenty of sediment in the wine, so I ask him to decant it. Again, before I can say anything, he rushes off to the kitchen to decant and brings it back. Strike three.  Low quality service attributed to POOR management. NO way that they should be getting away with this for the price they are charging.",

My wife had the chile relleno and thought it was probably the best meal she has ever had!  The waiter convinced me to try the special - venison chops with a blueberry-chili sauce.  I'm not a big venison fan, but this was also very good.  The service was attentive, but relaxed.  The total damage was $160 including tip for 3 drinks, an appetizer, and 2 entrees.",

    "text": "As a long time fan of Food Network, could not resist trying Bobby Flay's place. I was first of all pleased to find that the pricing was actually quite reasonable, lunch for three with tax and tips was about $150 including a super deluxe marguerita. The food was all excellent. I ordered Chile Rellenos, wife had Sweet Potato Hash, which was really good and son had the Mesa Burger (of course). All excellent, well seasoned, well presented. Decor and atmosphere were all very nice, service excellent. The only slightly negative part of the experience was the waiter. He was a bit too opinionated. I do not mind recommendations, but he seemed a bit put out when we did not order what he thought we should. Small thing maybe, but it somehow bothered me. Still thoroughly enjoyed it, will go back.",

    "text": "For my first night in Vegas I tried the Michelin-star recipient Mesa Grill. The dcor was like something out of A Clockwork Orange. The glass windows were shades of yellow, red, blue, and green; the ceiling looked like the hull of a ship; the chairs were adorned with cow print. Apparently this was supposed to be a revolutionary interpretation of the restaurant's theme of southwest cuisine theme.  To start, the bread was adventurous but not a favorite. Now that I remember it, the bread was a corn muffin with jalapeo and corn kernels in it. At first the muffin just tasted rather bland and stale; then the jalapeo aftertaste bitch slapped my throat and said \"fuck you\" on the way down.  As an appetizer I had the server-recommended tiger shrimp and corn tamales with a cilantro-garlic sauce. Never having tasted tamale before, I had no idea what to expect. The cilantro-garlic sauce elevated the dish to a new level. The tamales were spicy and flavorful with bits of corn hidden inside, just for fun. The shrimp were cooked just right and didn't last long on the plate. Bob Ross would've called them \"our little secret\". Then, he would have threatened your life to make sure you would never tell anyone that secret.  The entre was fine but not memorable - lamb tenderloin with a cilantro-mint sauce. The lamb was a bit overcooked and on its own not incredibly flavorful. What was impressive was how Southwest American and Mediterranean cuisines seemed to have wild sex on the plate. The mint took me for a ride to the best gyro-serving establishment I've never been to. The cilantro took role of the prison bitch to the powerful mint flavor. All in all, it was a very satisfying meal.",

Cactus pear margaritas are the best way to start your meal, and please try the pumpkin soup and pork loin. You will not regret trying this place. If you hit big, make it your celebratory dinner.

Unfortunately things went downhill from there...maybe we had a bad cook that day but I sampled most dishes from our party and was severely dissapointed with most dishes, especially for the prices being charged.  I had the duck breast, and it was way undercooked even though I asked for medium-well.  When I questioned the waiter, he was condescending and said \"They don't like overcooking duck- that's the way it should be.\"  Ooookay, I guess being the customer and paying $40 for raw duck is my fault and I'm too stupid to know what I like.  The pork was ok, but again was undercooked.  The sweet potato tamale was good as was the salmon.  The blue corn muffins were extremely dry and crumbled into a million pieces before I could even take a bite.  Honestly I think this place is a tourist ripoff with a strange and poorly executed menu.",

Not too much, but definitely different. Bobby Flay is an iron chef for a good reason. I feel he could make any dish great (as witnessed on Throwdown program) so whenever the menu veers off course, I recommend trying that dish. For me it was the sweet potato hash with poached eggs and green tomatillo salsa. I thought the tamales were the best app, but I also tried the shrimp, queso, and duck. My brothers split a steak sandwich and burger and seemed to like the steak but love the burger. Everything tasted good at Mesa grill.",

I had New York strip as well as shared a blue corn duck appetizer and a bottle of wine.  The steak was easily by far the best steak I have had in my life.  I actually closed my eyes while chewing.  I love steak and am a bit of a cook myself but this was just heaven.  I could have eaten two of them.  The appetizer was very nice as well and interesting.  Even the bread that was served has some chili taste in it and was nice.  I also sampled the pork tenderloin and thought it was very good but I am a steak man and usually I would order something like a ribeye which is pretty much guaranteed to have flavor but Bobby Flay being from New York and all I decided to go with the New York strip.  Boy was it a life changing steak!!!!  It was 48$ for the steak and I think the two of us got out of the joint for around 200$ with one appetizer one dessert and a bottle of nice red wine.  I would absolutely be back to eat the same steak again.  It came with a red and green MESA sauce....I will probably order a bottle as I think they sell it separately.  Wow what a steak!  If you thought Bobby Flay was hype then you were very wrong my friend.",

First of all we had a reservation and waited for a table when it wasn't busy. Then we got seated and had to ask for a wine list after sitting for 5 minutes. Then we ordered sparkling water (which i don't really care about but it was my fiance's birthday!) and they brought us tap water. We ordered a nice bottle of wine but had to flag our server down to order, then to get bread, then to get our plates cleared, and then for the bill...and we were patiently waiting the whole time (i don't want my food spit in) Then the couple next to us decided to go through a divorce...I mean it. They were screaming at each other and the husband decided to get up and leave, he was totally piss drunk and stumbling. Then he came back only to greet the friends they were meeting and pretend they were okay. But the entire time they were screaming and yelling and the waiters at the station right behind them didn't say a word to them about their profanity, their volume or anything while we were spending over $100 and trying to have a romantic dinner. Totally ridiculous service...but the food was good. Better places to go.",

The queso fundido is the best cheesiest thing I have ever had( common theme here) comes with blue corn tortillas. For my first course ordered the sweet potato soup (creamy, sweet and spicy), Second course ordered his famous green chile burger with seasoned fries (perfectly seasoned), for dessert was a lemony sorbet with fresh fruit oh so refreshing to cleanse the palatte( and yes slight spice in that sorbet not in a bad way) Overall, we all left this place so uncomfortably full, but my table all agreed by FAR this was the best lunch we had all ever had!!! Bobby Flay is no joke when it comes to his restaurant!! He definitely rains supreme as an Iron chef!!!",

It's just that among the cheap, smoky, overweight Vegas scene, the high tab comes off as pretentious and affected.",

I sit up at the bar to eat, so I can't speak for the table service, but each time at the bar, Steve takes care of everyone very well and ensures everyone has a good experience. I'm somewhat of a tequila and margarita snob and this place makes one of the best margaritas that I haven't made myself-no mix! The Pork Tenderloin, Cornmeal Chile Rellano and Queso Fundido are \"must haves\"",

    "text": "Very hit and miss with dinner at Mesa.   The hits: Obviously a beautifully/artfully designed layout and location. We had two servers working together which made service incredibly fluid and we appreciated that. The shrimp tamale was creative, really tasty, and lots of texture. The shrimp was perfectly cooked (read not chewy) and the tamales were great -- you could really taste the masa. The corn-cilantro sauce was super flavorful as well. The crispy squash blossoms were so damn good. Filled with ricotta and corn with a slightly sweet and spicy pepper sauce, the squash blossoms were perfectly fried yet not oily. For entrees we had the blue corn crusted halibut and the fire roasted veal chop and ordered a side of mashed potatoes with cilantro pesto. Delicious!! The halibut was moist and flaky, with a crust of basil and oregano and a layer of sweet tomatoes. Yum! The veal chop was perfectly seared and had a maple glaze and wild rice and sage butter side. I wanted to gnaw on the chop bone all night! The mashed potatoes were also good and the cilantro added a great flavor.   The misses: I found the blue corn bread to be completely crumbly. The butter was rock hard so when I tried to spread a bit of it on the bread everything crumbled. The first cocktail my friend ordered was a pomegranate martini...easy enough with simple ingredients, but instead the bartender used Stirrings brand Pomegranate martini mix. Ugh...totally ruined the taste and gave it an overly sweet and unnatural taste. How could a restaurant held in such high regard use such a cheap ingredient? I expect more when I am paying almost $15 for a martini. And so should you!   Otherwise a great experience. Some wackiness around us, but an interesting and flavorful dining experience.",

The restaurant is beautiful with enough atmosphere yet enough quiet places.  Our waitress was really knowledgeable and terrific.  The bread basket was yummy and plentiful....although we would have liked to have been asked if we wanted more.  My mojito and husband's peach margarita were refreshing.  My husband had the chicken (($24) and I had the veal chop ($42).  Mine included a tamale, my husbands just the chicken.  With cocktails at $12-13 things get expensive fast...which we knew.  My veal chop was really really good as was my husband's chicken.  BUT, when you spend $150 for 2 I really expect to be at the restaurant for 1.5-2 hours....fine dining.  After an hour the busboy came by to clear my plate....I wasn't done and did not intend to be done as this was our evening out.  After the third time I asked him to please stop asking me if I was done.  So, the price for quantity of food was 25% higher than needed.  The food was excellent. And we disliked being rushed while paying dining prices.  So we will not come back and revisit past restaurants such as 808 at Ceasars.",

Since I was by myself, I decided to sit at the bar and order appetizers. Thankfully there was no wait.   Bread Basket -- complimentary warm bread basket while you wait. The corn muffin is to die for!  Shrimp Tamale -- One of their signature dishes, and its a must. I love tamales, and Bobby Flay has definitely raised the bar with this appetizer. I can see why it was listed on Food Networks \"Best Thing I've Ever Eaten\"  Tuna Nachos -- Thankfully there is no cheese on these nachos. It is sashimi served with a couple different sauce with chips to scoop. Good light appetizer with a lot of flavor.   White Peach Margarita -- Excellent margarita with high quality alcohol. No syrups were used while making this cocktail, and it gave me a good buzz just after one cocktail.  Overall it was an awesome dining experience -- job well done Bobby Flay!",

    "text": "Wanted to branch out & try something different, so one dinner was at Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill.  I recommend getting reservations, because this place was packed!  And don't flake on your reservation, either.  These guys mean it when you make a reservation because if you no-show, they charge you $50 per head!  Opps did you oversleep?  That's a pretty expensive nap you just took.  It's right by the sportsbook at Caesar's Palace.  We arrived right on time and were promptly seated.  The menu isn't quite as big as I was expecting, so we were able to narrow it down to 3 things, with pictures attached.  Ranked in order, they were: -scallop salad.  Micro greens, 3 scallops with a slightly spicy dry rub, and balsamic vinegar-like dressing.  Scallops were perfectly cooked and definitely the highlight of the dinner. -lobster.  It's cooked and taken out of the shell, so it's easy to eat and therefore you're not creating a mess in a fancy Las Vegas restaurant.  Mrs. C states that the sauce tastes like reduced bisque, and quite delicious. -pork tenderloin + twice baked potato.  The 3 pieces of pork tenderloin had a spicy dry rub, and then are nicely plated with 2 more sauces.  I have a pretty good tolerance for spicy food, but this was a tad too spicy for me.  The twice baked potato was good, but I should have gotten it without the horseradish.  Our server, to her credit, told us that the horseradish is mixed in, but not spicy.  She was right and it wasn't spicy, but knowing what I know now, I would have skipped the horseradish part of it.  This is a good meal, and there's no question that there is a lot of attention to detail to the food and our service was quite good.  I just think that for the money spent, this is an average value, and that's why I marked down 1 star.  Our dinner the day before at Sedona Lounge was only half the cost per person, and I was much happier.  But sometimes it's about the experience and crossing items off your bucket list, and if you can't do that in Vegas, then you might want to check if you still have a pulse.  =)",

We shared the rough cut tuna nachos ($16), and it was very light and refreshing. The portion was small though, so not really good for sharing among a group of 3+.   Main entree: Ordered the Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich with Southwestern Fries ($16; grilled red onion, Argula ancho chile mayonnaise) - DELICIOUS! The pork was thick, juicy, flavorful and tender. The mayonnaise really brought together the entire sandwich, and the fries were so good that my friends ordered another side dish of it. Definitely recommend this sandwich.   One of us also ordered the Spicy Chicken + Sweet Potato Hash ($18), which he liked very very much.",

I have a little unrequited love crush on Bobby Flay, so I dragged my hungover group over to Mesa Grill so I could finally see what his food was all about. Definitely worth the trek in the heat.  I ordered the cactus pear iced tea-- I wouldn't say this was worth it.  I thought it was going to be an extra special, spectacular iced tea.  To be honest, while it was quite refreshing, it tasted like a normal iced tea to me, aka, not worth $4.   The starting bread basket was excellent! I enjoyed all the different breads-- it ranged from jalapeno corn bread, to a sweet dessert bread.  Munching on this made me almost too full to eat my main dish, the spicy chicken and potato hash.  This dish was so rich!  I could only have one piece (it comes with two) but I enjoyed the spiciness paired with the sweetness of the sweet potato hash.  I only wish the outside was crunchier-- I think that would've added to the texture and made the dish perfect.  I'm not sure I would get this next time, just because it was quite rich and maybe a little heavy.   I want that bread now. Sigh.",

My only suggestion would be to add something to the plate.  Some little side of rice or maybe a small piece of corn bread.  You are only served one (large) but it is kinds of lonely on the plate.  Hubby got salmon . . . he thoroughly enjoyed his mean as well.  This place is always crowded so make a reservation . . . The staff was aware that we had a show reservation and made every effort to accommodate our schedule even suggesting a back door exit to be nearer to the theater entrance.    Mesa Grill has been at Caesars for a long time. It is consistently excellent.  I have seen many \"glamour chefs\" open and close restaurants on the Strip. . Not so with Bobby Flay and the Mesa Grill.",

We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share- lobster tacos (they had a kick), romaine salad (amazing croutons ), chicken skewers (that our waiter showed us how to make into delicious tacos), and the whole reason I wanted to come to Mesa: the tiger shrimp tamale.  The tamale is one of the best (if not THE best) things I have ever eaten.  I will be coming back to Mesa every time I'm in Vegas just to eat that dish.",

My cocktail: the white peach margarita was also amazing.   In addition to the outstanding food, the decor was appealing and the service was excellent. I can't wait to visit again!",

At first we were disappointed that they only serve brunch menu during the day time and not the full menu, but once the food arrived, it sure changed our mind.  First of all, the bread basket is so freaking amazing! Comes with 4 different types of breads and each were delicious! My favorite were the cheddar jalapenos corn bread and the coffee cake/bread.  We ordered so many things but my absolute favorite dish was the tamales. It is made with fresh ingredients that you can really taste. The addition of large bits of fresh sweet corn is genius.  The drinks were ok. I would skip it even though apparently their margaritas are very popular.  Service was quick and attentive. Would definitely recommend!",

Unlike other hotels in Vegas, valet here is not based on tip only and it is only complimentary for extreme high rollers. So I ended up paying $18 plus $5 tips, a total of $23, for parking.

    "text": "I wan't sure what to expect.  I had high hopes since I have a fan girl crush on Bobby Flay.  Sometimes the celebrity chef restaurants seem like a gimmick but this was authentic. I wasn't disappointed.    We went for brunch and the menus do change, so some of the reviewed items might not be available when you go.   Its located in Cesars Palace we ended up going to circles a few times trying to locate the place.  The Gordon Ramsey sign was HUGE we spotted that from a mile away but Mesa Grill's sign was below the slot machine level and more difficult to spot. Bobby Flay didn't have his name blasted everywhere or his profile picture staring at you anywhere.  Unpretentious, thank you for that.     They have a great selection of margaritas but they also have a full bar if you want a mimosa or cocktail. I got the brunch party started with their Partido margarita.  It was the lowest calorie \"skinny\" margarita.  It's also the least sweet option, which is why I went for it.  My date ordered the Mesa Margarita (house).  Nothing spectacular but the prices weren't bad for drinks in Vegas.  They bring out a complimentary basket of warm breads.  In the brunch bread basket we had blueberry coffee cake, spiced (maybe carrot) scones, jalapeno cheese, corn breads  We got the food order started with the Goat Cheese queso fundido. Rajas (poblana w/ cream), Blistered Serrano Vinaigrette drizzled on top of molten gooey white cheese with goat cheese crumbles throughout. Blue Corn Tortilla Strips were served on the side. It was an awesome appetizer.  My favorite part was the browned crispy top of the cheese. This is nothing like \"queso\" in texas so don't order if you're looking for some yellow/orange velveeta cheese.   For my brunch entree I went with the BBQ lamb Cobb salad with avocado, Tomato, Maytag Blue Cheese, hard boiled eggs, bacon and Buttermilk Dressing.  Seriously the best cobb salad I've ever had and one of the top preparations of lamb I've had.  The lamb was seasoned with a warm spicy seasoning (maybe cumin, chili powder and cayenne) and cooked rare.  It was oh so tender and delicious.  It was piled on top of the salad.  I stabbed the salad with my fork and hit chunks of crumbling creamy blue cheese and whole think cut strips of crispy bacon.  The buttermilk dressing brought together all the flavors.  I really enjoyed eating it even though I was hungover and not that hungry.    My date ordered the Green Chili cheeseburger with Queso Sauce, Roasted Poblanos, Pickled Red Onions.  The burger was served with Southwestern seasoned Fries.  The burger was ordered medium and came out cooked perfectly. It was fat, juicy and seasoned to perfection.  The queso sauce and and roasted chilies gave it a kick of flavor that took it to the next level.  It was almost a knife and fork burger but if you don't mind getting messy you can eat it with your hands.    I get that some people are expecting great service since its Bobby Flay's restaurant but this isn't five start dining.  Its a casual restaurant.  I was in shorts and flip flops. We had OUTSTANDING service for a casual dining experience. Our drinks were constantly filled, water was provided and refilled often, the waitress was well versed in the menu and made recommendations. Food was delivered promptly. Perfecto.   I've had food just as good elsewhere for less.  The bill was a little high but THIS IS VEGAS BABY :)",

I had a total for four drinks that ran about $90+ dollars, but that is to be expected when drinking in Las Vegas; especially on The Strip. I had two Long Island Ice Teas and a White Peach Sangria, both drinks were exceptionally tasty and strong!   Upon reviewing my receipt two weeks later I noticed there was an additional item that was on my receipt that totaled $9.99 that I don't remember (our table only had drinks). While at the establishment, I didn't notice the extra charge as I was a bit buzzed. I was not going to go through the hassle of calling American Express to dispute a $9.99 charge or the mesa grill.  I rated them two stars simply due to the fact that there was a mysterious charge on my receipt. I will revisit The Mesa Grill when I go back to Las Vegas and I'll re-evaluate my experience.",

Very accommodating and offered some great recommendations on the menu. But this time the Steak was horrible and almost unacceptable. The quality of the Steak was not tender and the flavor tasted just not up to the usual mesa grills standards. Could it be new staff working in the kitchen?   Kids menu is available. Offered at around the $12 range. Burger etc. My son who usually loves burgers refused to eat it. And did not enjoy his meal. I would say the Burger was alright but nothing to rave about.  Drink options was ok probably depends on who is working the bar. My last few visits were more impressive  Overall I would say this experience was definitely disappointing but I think I will be returning eventually and hopefully can continue to taste some quality food and drinks again.",

For dessert, we had banana cream pie.  It was just weird tasting.  We all tried to figure out what was in it.  I would never go back!

The fish tacos were tiny with a sliver of over cooked fish, the smoked quesadilla was over spiced and dry, the fully loaded baked potato was half of a potato, barely loaded and dry.  Glad we didn't order anything more. We should have gone to Ramsay's Pub and Grill. Quality control on point",

    "text": "A great place for high-end Tex-Mex, but bring your wallet. The red pepper vinaigrette, queso fundido, and mushroom quesadilla are unparalleled. Sophie's Chopped Salad is good, just wish the cheese was shredded and not in dice-sized esophagus-clogging chunks. I was told that Sophie is the name of the owner's daughter. He also has a horse named Sophie, which seems rather insensitive. \"I love you, Sophie!\" \"Me, Daddy?\" \"No, I was speaking to the horse.\"   If you desire a quiet place to dine, this is not your place. Mesa Grill, with its wooden floors, is louder than one of Steve Harvey's suits. The tables are very close and other persons conversations can be easily heard. We were caught in a crossfire of words, which proved to be hilarious. On one side was some old Confederate foot soldier and his wife, from somewhere in Louisiana if I were to guess. Jed Clampette and bride were so excited to be there. The old rebel exclaimed, \"We love Bobby Fillet! That red-headed ninja can really knows his craft!\" The Louisianans were immediately corrected by an effeminate male couple we'll call Liberace and Mariachi. One of them said, \"It's FLAY, BOBBY FLAY, not FILLET, sir.\" Reb didn't like being corrected, \"Well what the hell do you know?\" Liberace responded, \"Thomas and I know BF very well.\" Jeb observed, \"Yeah I've heard that about you fellas. The Warden turns a blind eye and suddenly the whole jailhouse is rockin', a giant rugby scrum of steamy man passion, but I don't think that's appropriate dinner talk.\" Mariachi quickly elucidated, \"BF, that's an abbreviation for BOBBY FLAY!\" Things got worse when Reb overheard Mariachi asking the waitress a question. \"Is your tilapia fresh?\" He interjected across our table, \"Boy, what kind of foul-mouthed question is that? You got no right asking her about her lady business!\" My girlfriend corrected the gentleman, \"Please, sir, tilapia is a type of fish! They serve it here as an entree.\" Reb was a quick learner, \"Oh, you mean like catfish or something. Gotcha' My bad. I was wondering why these two fellas were asking about such a thing when that's clearly not their cup of tea if you know what I mean.\" He was quiet for the remainder of the meal, though was clearly bated by the Wham band members in the final exchange about a half hour later. Liberace told the server, \"We'd like to get a couple of 12-year-olds. Peety, neat, from Glengyle, preferably.\" The old Louisianan began his meltdown, \"Why you monsters! You want this nice waitress here to get you a couple of 12-year-old boys named Pete and Glen so you and your mandate can go all Sandusky on those poor little fellas?! I know we're in Vegas but I can't fathom...\" The server cut Reb off, \"Sir, they're requesting a couple of Scotches.\" Reb responded, \"It don't matter where the kids are from, such a thing is an abomination...oh my, they meant Whiskey, right? Damn, well, shame on me. I suppose there's no harm in having a drink or two. It's just when a couple of flowery gladiators say they want to wrap their hands around a twelve-year-old, well, what am I supposed to think?\"   In addition to the peripheral entertainment, the service was excellent, timing was precise, and the desserts were surprisingly amazing.",

    "text": "My brother was very excited about coming to Vegas for his 50th. He wanted to come to Mesa Grill. I have to say, I was kind of excited to try Bobby Flay's place even though I know he is not cooking here. I still thought that the quality would be there and the service would be excellent.   It was very average at best. The food was OK but certainly not the best Vegas meal. Heck, not even the best meal this weekend. I had the Tuna steak on the pine nut cous cous. My tuna steak was definitely tough on the outside and the cous cous was under cooked. I also ordered the double baked potato and the skin was super burnt. I was disappointed with the food.   The service  was what surprised me the most. I told the person seating us that it was my brothers 50th birthday to which he acknowledged. As dinner was ending we told our waitress that it was my brothers birthday. She simply replied, if you order a dessert we will put a candle on it. We did order a dessert and while she was away, another man came up and dropped off the dessert without even a happy birthday or enjoy.   The overall experience was neither great nor terribly bad. I would not think I would be interested in visiting again. I am a huge Bobby Flay fan on his TV show but it is not translating to this restaurant. There are a lot of great restaurants in Vegas so coming back would be a tough sell for my family.",

    "text": "Cool looking restaurant. It isn't as loud as I thought it was going to be...they break out the different sections rather nicely to avoid a huge cavernous space. Service was impeccable. Food was very good. This is what we had:   Combo of 3 ceviches for $22: lobster was forgettable, scallop was yummy, shrimp was very good too. Portions were tiny.   White peach margarita was AWESOME!!!! Prickly pear was passable....no prickly pear flavor...I'm Mexican, so I know...skip it.   Lamb porterhouse chops....WONDERFUL.   Pork tenderloin....very good. Lamb is better.   Brussel sprouts were good. Waiter told us it was enough for 2 (because I asked!) It better be for $8. Umm, there were about 6 brussel sprouts cut in half with a few pomegranate seeds...sorry that isn't worth $8.  And just sprinkling pomegranate seeds on it doesn't make it \"cool\" or whatever the intent was.    What I don't get are the sweet tamales that are paired with the entrees. I had the pumpkin tamal...lukewarm, dry. My partner had some other kind of sweet tamal and it was moister and tastier than mine....regardless, I think the tamales need to be savory to pair well with the entrees...how about nice veggie tamales with cheese and a bit of spice...isn't spice what you are known for Bobby?   I wanted to re-wrap the tamal and take it home to eat with a tall glass of milk - would have been worth the effort if it tasted better. Doesn't work with the dish.   I still give it 4 stars because of the white peach margarita and the yummy entrees. We know what to avoid next time and explore other parts of the extensive menu.",

    "text": "I have been a fan of Bobby Flay since catching him on \"Iron Chef\" and  \"Throwdown\" but never really thought I would eat in his restaurant. My  boyfriend really wanted to go because he said that a friend told him that the burgers were amazing. I'm not a fan of burgers but I did find items on the menu that I would enjoy. We walked in for Saturday Brunch and had an amazing server. She was very sweet and informative. We decided to order the salmon and tuna tartares for an appetizer. It was incredible. The flavors worked perfect together and had just a little bit of spice.   For entrees, my boyfriend ordered the buffalo burger with South-West french fries and I ordered the bacon and hash brown quesadilla that  came with an egg and salsa on top. He enjoyed his burger and I loved my entree. I don't have any complaints. Anything that combines bacon, hash browns, and eggs is wonderful to me.   I would also recommend ordering a Cactus Pear Margarita. I've never had anything like it before. I also wanted to try the Peach Margarita, but didn't want to spend the extra money. The restaurant is a bit on the pricey side but that's to be expected of a restaurant owned by one of  the Food Network's most popular chefs.   I would def go back next time I'm in Vegas.",

We arrived late to our reservation due to incorrect navigation, but the staff was very polite and understanding and still seated us right away. The customer service here is above average. We were soon greeted by our server who was very knowledgable about the menu and recommendations. We ordered the rabbit and a chicken quesadilla. The rabbit was cooked perfectly and the sauce that accompanied it was delicious! They also had a couscous with the rabbit that was so amazing! Even though it was a side, the couscous was my favorite of all the items we had here. The quesadilla was also very tasty, and it was a far more simple dish. Neither dish was over the top amazing, but both were cooked perfectly and had good flavor. The reason for the lack of stars in this review is due to the price. Although both dishes were great, to me, the prices were too high for overall experience.",

    "text": "I went on Friday night with my girlfriend and a friend of ours. The comments below are either my thoughts on what I ordered or their thoughts almost verbatim (we discussed my writing a review over drinks after we left)  House margaritas: Extremely heavy on the lime, to the extent that the tequila is lost and it ends up tasting like a key lime martini  Blue corn pancake with duck: had potential, but it was over sauced to the point that the duck was lost. The pancake was more of a crepe, and it was overpowered as well. All you could taste was the sauce.  Cornmeal crusted chile relleno entree: The chile relleno was good and cheesy. The crispy crust was unique, but it didnt necessarily add to the dish.  22 oz bone in rib eye: I ordered this medium rare. It came on the blue side of rare throughout and burned to a crisp on the outside. The chipotle glaze was completely lost and instead it tasted like a briquette. I was especially disappointed in this rib eye because a) I can cook a steak better than that and b) It's Flay's restaurant; you don't screw up grilled meat.  Side dish of chile relleno filled with black beans and rice. Good, but not great. The grainy cornmeal crust took away from an otherwise excellent stuffed chile (the person who ordered this is different than the person who ordered it as an entree)  Sixteen spice chicken: No complaints from the person who ordered it. She seemed pleased but not overjoyed and appreciated the large portion.  Overall, none of us felt that Mesa Grill met expectations. Two of us gave it a 2 star review, the third would give it a 3 star review. If you want to go to a celebrity chef restaurant in Vegas, I would recommend Batali's place. A lunch I had there 2 years ago still haunts me in my dreams.",

    "text": "My wife and I are big Bobby Flay fans.  We watch him on the Food Network all the time.  Who doesn't?  So walking around Ceasar's Palace we thought it would be cool to eat at the Mesa Grill.  It was around brunch time.  We were waiting to be seated but the waitress was on the phone.  So we waited.  After about two minutes she hangs up to tell us that they are closing to get ready for dinner.  So we could not be sitted but come another time.  We couldn't believe the rudeness of the girl.  I would of been totally cool if she just told us they were closed in the beginning instead of having us wait for her to get off the phone and her tone be like \"her shit don't stink\".  Stuck up hostesses are the worst.  Uggg! Being the gluttons of punishment we are, we decide to go again the next day again around lunch time.  I should know by now to never give places a second chance but oh well.  Again there is a \"my shit don't stink\" hostess.  Are they trained to act this way?  It is a hot day so I have been wearing a ballcap around town.  They ask me to take off my hat or sit at the bar.  I pause and decide just go with the flow.  I am on vacation.  No need to ruffle any feathers even though my feathers are a little ruffled.  So I take my ballcap off. We decide to order some drinks and appetizers.  The drinks and appetizers were real good.  Bobby definitely gets a star for each. We also ordered lunch.  My wife a salad and a burger for myself.  My wife's salad is okay.  My wife said that it was something she could make herself.  Nothing spectacular.  My burger was okay too.  Way too much bread for a bun.  Even the waiter said that a lot of people say the same thing.  The meat was also not that flavorful.  I have had better.  We should of stayed with drinks and appetizers. Overall experience was a let down.  The hostesses suck ass and need to do a better job.  Seriously, you want that to be the first impression of your business.  The drinks and appetizers were good.  The salad was okay.  The burger was okay.  Not what I expected from a restaurant with Bobby Flays name on it.  Defiinitely plenty room for improvement.",

    "text": "Upon walking into the restaurant, we'd given our name and were seated within one minute. The hosts were friendly. The restaurant itself is beautiful! We were at the table maybe two minutes before our server (the amazing Encina) came over with our menus and a mouth-watering description of the night's specials. We were taken aback by the amazing service and care, not only because Encina and the rest of the staff care about their food and their customers but also because Lillie's Noodle House and Grotto Ristorante at the Golden nugget were such a shit-show with their horrific excuses for service (see those reviews for why).  She gave us a few minutes to peruse the drink menu and came back with waters before taking our order. We couldn't resist asking for her favorite appetizers and ended up getting two AMAZING appetizers: -Roasted Corn Soup: the soup itself is light and sweet, a delicious puree of sweet corn.  It came out warm and had a slight bit of heat that lingered in your mouth. It was perfectly seasoned and a great way to begin our meal. -Chicken and Black Bean Quesadilla: It's a great appetizer for four or two. The tortilla was crispy and had a little char to it. Inside, the cheese and meat mingled amazingly. On top, the cotija and quacamole beckoned us to the plate like Sirens.  We got our drinks and commented on how the meal was batting-a-thousand so far. White Peach Margarita (my friend and one of my brothers): the sweetest of the bunch. Tasty and light; great balance between the tequila and white peach flavors. Cadillac Margarita (my other brother): I like to taste my alcohol when I'm drinking and a Caddy guarantees that I will. This was a great margarita! Cactus Pear Margarita (my drink): I ordered this one because of the rave reviews on Yelp and it didn't disappoint. It wasn't too sweet and packed a nice punch. The flavor was great.  Encina was back within ten minutes to take our orders. Here's what we got (and loved): -Mango and Spice Crusted Tuna: good God almighty this was good (for an agnostic guy to say this is saying something)!!! The tuna was cooked perfectly. The spicy sear on the outside was enough of a crunch to perfectly contrast the tender tuna. The mango glaze the accompanied the fish was sweet enough to enhance the fish without being too sweet or overpowering. The pine-nut cous cous was soft and delicious. The green and red peppercorn sauces on the plate were the perfect accent. The peppercorns were a soft burst of peppery goodness. -Sixteen Spice Chicken: although not the route I would have gone, this was really good. For those who want to play it safe. The chicken was tender and the sixteen spices were definitely a party in my mouth, but chicken just isn't adventurous for me. My brother loved it; we both agreed that the spiciness level was great. -Coffee Rubbed Filet Mignon: The meat was incredibly tender and juicy. The rub on the outside could very well be the best thing ever put onto a piece of meat. The coffee shined through enough that you knew it was there, but didn't take over the dish. The mushroom-ancho chile sauce was the perfect sauce. -Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops: these were incredible!!! The spices were just right and the meat was tender. The garlic tamale was delicious as well.  Encina checked on us throughout the meal and kept us laughing. Once we were done, she put down the drink menu and the desert menu and said, \"Now, I know you're not leaving without another drink and some desert!\" She knew us too well!!! Here's the grand finale: -Pomegranate martini (friend): Light on pomegranate taste. Tasted a little cough-syrupy. She was not impressed, but our tastebuds may have needed a nap after the amazing dinner we had. -Mesa Pisco Sour: very nice! The alcohol shone through without being too much. -Mango Buttermilk Upside Down Cake: not enough to share for more than two, but I was really the only one who wanted desert so it was perfect for everyone to have a taste. The cake was nice, light, and warm. The caramel rum sauce was fantastic and the mango ice cream was great.  We got to talking about how it was my birthday. At another table, I guess Encina heard us. She said, \"I wasn't eavesdropping or anything, but did I hear a birthday over here?\" They pointed to me and she replied, \"OK. Don't go anywhere\" and sprinted across the restaurant. She came back, told me to close my eyes as she lit a candle and placed it in a small ramekin of their homemade vanilla-bean whipped cream (best ever!). She told me to make a wish before I opened my eyes and said, \"From my heart, happy birthday.\" It was one of the nicest restaurant birthdays I've ever had.  Overall, we couldn't have been happier with dropping close to $300 on a dinner for four. The food was amazing! The service was spectacular. Encina is incredibly sweet and takes care of you. She took the absolute best care of us.  Do yourself and your tastebuds a favor and eat at Mesa Grill!",

    "text": "Bobby Flay seems like kind of a jerkface. That said, his food is fantastic!! His restaurant is located in Caesar's and, if you sit near a wall, you can watch all the sports games and stats while you eat. Or you could just stick your face into your food, which is actually a wise choice.  We tried three appetizers: the shrimp and grouper ceviche, the queso fundito, and the fried green tomato and blue crab salad. All three were really good, but my favorite was the tomato blue crab. It was limey and cilantro-y and glorious. The queso was amazing, too, but how hard is it to melt cheese?   I had the salmon for my entree. It's True that all the food is floating in pools of sauce with more, different sauce dribbled on top of them from a squeeze bottle, but the sauces are TASTY. The salmon came in a puddle of black bean sauce with a really really spicy, flavorful ancho chile sauce drizzled over it. The salmon was honey-glazed, flakey and fres. My only complaint is that a wild Alaskan would have improved upon the already fantastic dish.  However, my friend had the 16-spice chicken, which, incidentally, was on Iron Chef that very week, and I reccomend that EVERYONE get it. I didn't want to order the same thing as one of my dining companions, but I wish that I had. The chicken was AMAZING. The spice rub was a little sweet for my taste, but the chicken itself was cooked to perfection. I've never had such well-cooked chicken before. It was juicy, plump, no dryness at all, even in the white meat.    As for side dishes, the corn is yummy, but the cilanro pesto mashed potatoes takes the cake. I couldn't stop eating them.  So that's what I reecomend: the 16-spice chicken and the cilantro pesto mashed potatoes. Get it and eat carefully and deliberatly. Then pretend you're an Iron Chef judge. It'll be fun, I promise.",

My boyfriend ordered the hamburger and it was really perfection.  I had the pork tenderloin sandwich which I have had before.  When I go to Mesa for dinner I have the pork tenderloin and they used that to make this.  Both sandwiches came with fries.  Crunchy, flavorful and addicting.  Those things are really dangerous.",

    "text": "Tucked inside Caesar's Palace, Mesa Grill provides a hip pocket of sanctuary away from the massive casino and all the beeping and honking from the slot machines. We had reservations already, and I would recommend making them at least that morning to ensure you have a spot. There are also tons of deals in Vegas offering 1/2 price meals at many of the nicer restaurants on the strip. Unfortunately, we didn't get those tickets. Theres a nice bar that offers a huge selection of tequila and margaritas that you can sip or gulp down while you wait.  We were seated right away, and the tough process of selecting which delicious entrees to eat was tough. We decided on the Crunchy Squash Blossoms as our appetizer and we each took our pick of delicious margaritas. The Blossoms were light and crispy on the outside and warm and creamy on the inside. There was a sweet citrus sauce that balanced everything out with savory and sweet, creamy and crunchy. We also had a small bread basket that had different types of blue corn muffins, raisin bread and jalapeno cornbread, very tasty.  Our entrees continued to impress. The New York Strip steak was a fair size, I had it cooked medium rare. It was juicy with that delicious hint of grilling there, but not overwhelming. There was a house steak sauce that was very good, but I prefer my steaks as they are. I ordered a black bean and rice stuffed chile relleno fried in a corn meal coating. It was pretty good, but probably the weakest of everything that I ate. The roasted corn side was very good, not really creamed corn but it does have a light drizzle of cream and cheese, it had just a little sweet taste from the corn.   The real show stopper was the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin. It had a Bourbon Ancho Chile Sauce and was accompanied with a sweet potato tamale with crushed pecan butter. Absolutely heavenly.  The service was spot on and our waitress was helpful with suggestions and prompt with service and checking in on us. It was an overall perfect dining experience and I thought it was delicious.",

We ordered too much food but managed to eat it all.  I would demand you order the brussel sprouts in the pomegranate reduced concoction.. sounds a little bizarre but it was recommended by our waiter and it was AMAZING I would like the bottom of the plate if no one was watching.  The drinks are well made and the service is prompt and courteous.  I have yet to try the one in NYC but if it is as good as the one in Vegas then I can not wait!",

    "text": "Decided to have dinner here at Mesa as the Bacchanal Buffet was madness and my wife and I couldn't have been happier.  This place does get busy and it's about noisy as it's a few steps away from the casino and always full sports book.  Reservations are recommended but walk ins are welcome.   There's a decent sized bar available for patrons who wait to be seated.  The restaurant is very colorful and appealing to the eyes.   The tables are a good size and offer all sorts of arrangements suitable for small or large groups.  My wife and I were seated closer to the bar and had a great view of the sports book. Which is what I needed as I had a heavy bet on the Steelers against the Colts.... let's just say that I really enjoyed my meal as the Steelers won lol.  The food we ordered were delicious and very flavorful. Portions were small as expected on the strip with prices that most people would consider are a bit overpriced but since I had won, didn't bother me.  I was starving and pretty much devoured the jalapeno bread but also decided on a few appetizers.  We had the crab cake and shrimp tamale to start coupled with a beer and wine. All choices were absolutely worth it.   Within minutes my wife's veal chop and my turkey dinner came out.   Both were perfectly cooked and seasoned. My plate was colorful and tasted as good as it looked. My wife's meal was delicious as well. It was plated perfectly that I had to take a pictures and of course have a taste.  The sides on my plate were so good that I'm literally salivating again just thinking about it. The kale as well as the yam were surprisingly good. I'm not usually a fan of both but I've changed my view now.   Our server was very attentive and always checking in on us. Our drinks were topped off and plates and table were cleared quickly.  Considering our bill was north of $200 I'd say it was worth it. You can probably find comparable meals off strip for half but to say that I've finally tried this place after all of these years is priceless.   Cheers Bobby Flay and crew!   My wife was satisfied which means I was too!  See you again when I'm back in Sin City!   Cheers!",

Whenever you eat TEX-MEX you expect a specific culmination of spices. The bread was top-notch, and the appetizers arrived in extremely small portions. Granted the flavor was decent, I wasn't completely satisfied. After starving all day at a convention in the local expo I needed all the food I could get. A famished stomach and some tequila on the rocks had me cleaning the plate of my coffee crusted filet (a style that has become very popular in recent years) at an alarming speed. I don't know if I'll come back to Mesa considering the plethora of Las Vegas restaurants that I have yet to try, but I may just have to stop in there if I get hot at the Caesar's blackjack table again.   Side note: our server was a wizard with his little crumb collector instrument that he periodically used to clean off the table cloth. I was rather impressed by his diligent work.",

Both times, I ordered the signature NEW MEXICAN SPICE RUBBED PORK TENDERLOIN (Bourbon - Ancho Chile Sauce + Sweet Potato Tamale with Crushed Pecan Butter). I feel like this dish screams Bobby Flay and is everything I imagined that his southwestern-inspired cooking would be. A little bit of heat, a bit of sweet, a bit of salt....such a perfect balance. I can see how this dish may be a bit too hot for some people but I loved the heat.   Also, the complimentary bread is fantastic. I don't even like cornbread but the Jalapeno Cheddar Corn Bread is reallll nice.   Don't forget a margarita! Stiff margs that go perfectly with the food!

The waiter said \"If we don't know how to cook chicken we should close our doors\".   It was WAY too spicy for my wife -- it was inedible to her.   The waiter seemed very annoyed she gave it back. Maybe the waiter is right -- they should close their doors.   I had the New York Strip steak.   it was good (not great).   My wife reordered.   She had the New York strip (well done).   The waiter warned \"it will take a long time\".  So I ate before and she ate after -- not together.  It would have been reasonable for the waiter to offer a soup or salad so we could eat together.   But that would have taken some intelligence and courtesy.  When we were done, the waiter thrust the dessert menu in  my wife's face -- you're normally asked \"do you want dessert\"  \"do you want to look at the dessert menu?\"  (I wasn't even asked).  It was once of the worst values we ever had for a fine dining experience ($175).   On the way out we spoke to the manager, but he gave us a \"thanks for sharing\" look.  It was a learning experience -- when we're so uncomfortable with a waiter, we'll go to the manager and ask for a different server.  This has happened VERY rarely.  Update:   I sent an email to <a href=\"mailto:info@bobblyflay.com\">info@bobblyflay.com</a> -- no response. Sent another email with some nasty comnments -- it bounced. Send another email -- someone answered, and forwarded it to the restaurant.    The manager communicated with me on email, asked for my phone number.   Several days later he called, we had a pleasant conversation, and he refunded my entire charge!!   Very nice!!",

The sauce that the shrimp & tamale were marinated in was to die for, so creamy!

    "text": "I have always enjoyed watching Bobby Flay on TV. Watching his throwdowns always left me wanting to try his meals. His flavor profile always sounds amazing. I've been to Vegas a good amount of times and when I went 8 years ago, I knew I HAD to try it. My experience then was amazing! I was just in Vegas with my husband and friends and our friends had not tried Mesa Grill and really wanted to. I usually like to try new places in Vegas, but my meal at Mesa was so memorable that I was OK with going again!   When making our reservations with Mesa, we informed them that we would be celebrating 2 anniversaries. We were provided with a nice table. The ambiance at Mesa is lovely! Everything from the warm colors, perfect lighting, to the open kitchen...it's inviting!   Upon being seated, our server wished all of us a happy anniversary! He explained some of the popular drink and food options, asked if we had any allergies, and if we had any questions. I ordered the white peach margarita, a friend ordered the pear margarita...both were so good!   We started our meal with the tiger shrimp and roasted garlic tamale. I'm usually not a tamale fan, but this was SO good. Very flavorful! The cilantro sauce on it was tasty! For the entree, I ordered the sixteen spice chicken which came with cilantro pesto mashed potatoes and a garlic mango sauce. Chicken can be boring, but this was very flavorful...bot bland at all! The mashed potatoes were sooooo creamy/buttery and the ultimate comfort food! Our table also ordered the elotes (corn, cotija cheese, lime) and the spinach. The elotes were very good. The spinach was nothing special at all. I would skip it. My husband had the lamb porterhouse chops and he LOVED them. They were massive.   I really don't think you can go wrong at Mesa Grill.   I think the ONLY nice touch would've been if they offered us a dessert to celebrate our anniversaries. A couple of other high-end chef restaurants in Vegas brought out a special dessert to celebrate. We even ordered desserts on top of that because they sounded good. Mesa Grill definitely didn't give us a complimentary celebratory dessert. Which is OK...but, compared to other places...it's something that is noticed. And a nice touch.",

We started with a couple of the signature margaritas - I would highly recommend the pear one - it was really delicious!    I shared an appetizer and a main with my husband and it was the perfect amount of food.  We tried the Tiger shrimp and roasted corn tamale.  It was so delicious.  The tamale was flavorful and not dry and all...the shrimp was perfectly good and the roasted corn sauce was fantastic.  We also had the grilled mahi mahi with green chili rice and yellow pepper mole.  The fish and rice were excellent, amazing flavor and perfectly cooked.  The mole was a bit on the salty side but overall it added a nice flavor.    I'd definitely go back and try them out for a casual dinner.  The service was excellent and friendly!",

The gentleman who seated us was gregarious and informative. He also delivered our food. The waiter was ok but other diners got much more info from their waiters. The basket of cornbread puffs and various muffins and breads was a delicious start as were fresh squeezed juices. We had the goat cheese queso fundido to start. It cooled too rapidly for us to really enjoy all its gooey goodness but it was tasty and full of fruity pepper flavors. We then ordered the New Mexican spiced pork loin sandwich and the glazed salmon. Sandwich was indeed spicy and had a lot of flavor. There was a lot going on. I wouldn't want to eat a whole sandwich with all those ingredients, but was happy to have a bite or two. The salmon had WAY too much going on. Every flavor competed with the next. I really didn't enjoy it. I don't think anyone would win at Beat Bobby Flay with that concoction of everything but the kitchen sink. I left somewhat hungry but satisfied that I'd given Mesa Grill a try. I don't think i would return of my own volition despite good service and some high points. Simpler recipes might allow ingredients to shine.",

I hope he opens a location in Dallas soon! The yellow pepper mole sauce on the mahi entree was unlike anything I've eaten before. I'm looking forward to researching his recipes and finding some creative ways to alter them for a vegan diet.   Tables were too close together, but other than that the atmosphere and decor was classy and clean. Watching the chefs cook was a plus, as well. This trip would've only been better had I had the opportunity to meet Bobby Flay himself.  (We also shared a Sophie salad, and it was boring... Don't get that.)",

They brought some bread that was made up of different kinds and we enjoyed that as well.  My wife has the coffee crusted filet and I had the bone in ribeye.  This place really knows how to make a steak as everything was cooked to perfection.  For sides we shared some of the mashed potatoes and corn.

These tables are a bit weird though and best avoided ( see picture) as the have a large mound like bit under the table which you end up having to place your feet on. It feels odd and uncomfortable. Go for the four legged table instead on the lower level.  We had spicy peppers cheese dip and blue corn tortillas for started which was excellent! For the main we had medium rare mesa burger. It was good. Caramelized onions, cheese and served with some excellent mustard ( English i think) The fries were great. My brother had the shrimp tacos. He said it was good but it was too pricey for what you get. 6 shrimp, two soft tacos and some salad stuff. Tasty but not worth the price. Best avoided! Would I come back, maybe.  I thought the food was good but did feel it was a bit pricey. It probably deserves 3 1/2 stars.",

I was actually pretty upset that I wasn't hungry because some of the entrees that were coming out of the kitchen were making me drool just looking at them.

I think that my server was also disappointed that I wasn't ordering an entree and taking up his table space where he could make a bigger tip off a bigger sale.

I really liked it but I couldn't really taste any goat cheese. I ordered it with grits and they were amazing. Cheesy, and soft, and packed with flavor.   The bf got the blue corn waffle. It was also really good but it gets too sweet/soggy after a while. Maybe you can ask for the fruit sauce on the side..   The cactus pear iced tea was not as good as I expected it to be. I swapped it for OJ instead and was much better. The iced tea has a subtle pear flavor.. I'd like a fruitier version instead.   Service was great but it was annoying to hear our server constantly being told to work faster to get people out. Her superior kept asking her what was going on with certain tables. Some people just take a while to order and I don't think it was right for her to be scolded for not having their orders in yet.   Overall an okay experience. With so many open tables it's weird that there was a wait for one.",

We also had a couple of peach margartias that were great -A+.  My wife had the pork tenderloin. This was out of this world and deserves a better grade than A+. Just a great dish. I had the mahi mahi and it was great - A. We also had a side of roasted corn - A+.  Our server Deanne really made the meal special. She was attentive and engaging, and offered great recommendations. When we inquired about the ingredients of a dish, she took the time to walk us through a similar recipe in one of Flay's cook books. Even though we came in five minutes before closing, she served us like it was the first table of the night and we were royals. A+ on service.  Bottom line - EAT HERE!",

The Lobster Tacos are awesome to start with, and the margaritas are excellent.  I had a craving for a couple weeks to go back to Mesa Grill, so Mr. Riches and I went there with the team.  The others at the table ordered the Veal, and they also enjoyed that.  However, the consensus was that it did not compete with the dishes I mentioned above.  If you want a reasonably priced meal, that won't take forever, stop by Mesa Grill for a bite.",

(Might be just for lunch. Dinner might require better attire.) The menu is still just as delicious. I ordered the Green Chile burger and it was good but my fries were too much and too salty.   The setting was nice and casual. Colorful decor and you can see the kitchen and watch the cooks while they do their thing. My only distaste was the strong smell of cigarettes from the surrounding casino that ruined my appetite. But then again, that's vegas.  Check it out if you have time but make sure you make reservations (Open Table is easy) just to be safe.",

Nothing about this restaurant is special or even worth talking about. The service is amazing but the food is very bland and the quality is lower than that of El Torito. Call me cheap but if I plan on spending $300 on a dinner with my husband it better be amazing and this place was far from that. After we left this restaurant we went back to our room to where I proceeded to eat a large king size bag of chips I bought at the airport after we landed about 3 hours prior to our dinner reservations. Long story short, go to El Torito, go to the food court, or find a taco cart on the strip, any of those options would be more tasty than the food they serve here .",

My wife had Rough cut tuna nachos, spicy chicken sweet potato hash, chocolate mouse(or something like that). The started bread they gave us was very different than a typical started in any other restaurant (regular bread with butter). Corn soup was a brilliant blend of sweet and spicy. Tuna and shrimps were fresh. Each sauce has quite unique taste (Guacamole is probably standard). The spicy mango sauce (if I hear what the server told me correctly) was heavenly; it blends well with the guacamole and salsa. Sweet potato is cooked through such that it has texture (not like baby food) topped with perfectly cooked poached eggs. Chocolate mousse dessert has 2 different mousse that complement each other taste very well. The caramel chunk provides a nice texture.  In summary, food was very good.  Service: Waiters are very friendly and attentive. They also know the menu well and were able to provide useful recommendation. We had a nice experience the moment we stepped into the restaurant.   Overall, the restaurant exceeded our expectation in both food and service.",

Also, I personally cook the best salmon I've ever tasted. Well, it was the best, until some \"Bobby Flay\" guy serves me this this Ancho Chile-Honey Glazed Salmon that the waitress recommended. I was appalled at the idea that any salmon of any kind could not only be cooked so perfectly, but cooked and presented almost to a level that of which is only reserved for swordfish. I was very impressed by this lunch at Mesa Grill. It makes me want to venture out into the world of gourmet seafood and see if there are any other fish out there that could challenge the mantle of the swordfish.",

The Cornmeal Crusted Chile Relleno is probably the most beautiful plate with gorgeous colors of the sauces.  It looked like a piece of art and it tasted really nice.  It is light, filled with a yummy cheese.  The shrimp tacos were very good.  The shrimp was tender and bursting with flavors and spices.  My friend had the salmon and loved it.  The salmon was flakey and perfectly cooked.  Dessert was great.  We had a chocolate cake and and a pistachio cake that were both great.  The pistachio had a strawberry ice-cream and fresh berries.

The food was amazing hands down; the service on the other hand was a huge disappointment. We had reservations however we still had to wait 15 minutes to be seated. Then the waiter we had was nothing less than rude. It was very clear he did not want to be there. I had the pork tenderloin sand which and it truly was everything I hoped it would be. Being a customer service manager I have expectations on what customer service should be, and would think Bobby would feel the same. On a scale of 1-5 the Customer service rating = 2  however the quality of food = 5. Normally I would chalk up the service as the waiter was just having a bad day, but being that the girls at the hostess stand were no better its hard to think it was just a bad day for everyone working that day. I am not sure I would return to this one of his establishments but would for sure try another one.",

My only complaint was the amount of cheese added to the salad, but luckily it was in larger cubes, so the excess was easy to pick out.   For my entree, I selected the hacked chicken.  Mole is VERY DIFFICULT to do right, so I was kind of worried about this one.  The chicken was so tender and juicy and the mole sauce was prepared perfectly, and it was used sparingly, so it didn't over power the other flavors on the plate.    Thoroughly impressed!

After hovering around the hostess station for about a half and hour we were seated.  It took almost 10 minutes before our waiter acknowledged us.  By this time we knew exactly what we wanted and just ordered at the same time we asked for water.  Water took almost another 10 minutes and we then had to ask another bus boy? waiter? to get it for us.  When another couple was seated in our area, I timed it from sit down to when he first approached them and it mirrored our experience.  So this was obviously a very poor waiter who needs to either be re-trained or doing something else.  The bread and butter to came out with meal. We ordered the burgers to try.  They were good, but not anything to make me want to endure their check-in system and poor service for.  We had eaten burgers at Mon Ami Gabi the day before and they were much better and we had A+ service.  Not to mention the price at Mesa was no deal.  I'll pay a lot for a good burger, but not when there is crappy service, forget it.  Our waiter basically ignored us until near the end of our meal.  Then he came back about every minute to try and \"be our friend\".  I get that whole recency effect.  He figures we will give him a tip based on that. Wrong.  I would never come back to the Mesa Grill.  With so many other great places to eat in Vegas with top-notch service, I would rather take my money and time there.",

Now I'll preface that my husband and I do like Bobby Flay and the recipes that he creates on his shows (I replicated his carmalized banana cream pie and it was great), however, I will judge the food by the FOOD, not the celebrity.  Having been to one of Rick Bayless' restaurants (and we're a fan of some of his other recipes) and being completely letdown we feel we can judge pretty independently.  Appetizer - The group ordered the Spanish Chorizo Quesadilla and Queso Fundido.  Both delicious and the everyone was able to have enough of the queso fundido.  Main Course - I had the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin with Sweet Potato Tamale.  This was great and very tasty!  I liked it so much that I googled the recipe and found it on Bobby Flay's website.  I even went so far as to make the recipe at home and it was still just as delicious (granted my sauce took a lot longer to thicken, but was still good).  Overall, this was a very good experience that I would highly recommend to others.",

    "text": "I'll admit, I didn't exactly have the highest expectations coming here. I'm wary of the celebrity chef phenomenon:  A celebrity chef starts and conceptualizes a restaurant, only never to return to the kitchen once the wheels have started turning and business picks up. The quality drops off once said chef leaves the kitchen, yet restaurant continues to thrive based on name alone.  That's what I was afraid of. And I'm glad that my assumptions were proven wrong in this case. Props to the service, it was excellent. One of my favorite things about this place is that although it serves a somewhat pricey menu, it wasn't stuffy at all. It had a lively atmosphere. The margaritas are also excellent here. (Probably contributed to the liveliness, now that I think about it).  We ordered the goat cheese with blue corn chips.The cheese came out on a cast iron pan and was still sizzling when it arrived on our table. Although we ran out of chips midway through, they happily obliged with a generous refill portion!  The rib-eye (with salsa rojo y verde) was phenomenal. It was made exactly how I liked it (pink with a warm red center), and had this charred crusty (almost caramelized) outside. One of the best rib-eyes I've ever had at any establishment.  The only thing I regret about this place is not listening to my girlfriend and coming here sooner!",

For starters they had a decent bread basket. The Grits were the best I've ever had and the GOAT CHEESE \"QUESO FUNDIDO\" was a solid appetizer.  This was the fist time I had Scambled Egg Chilaquiles.  It's a great combination of Southwest Flavors and Eggs.  I wasn't blown away by the Flavors but left Mesa pleased and full.  Overall Brunch was a nice way to Experience Mesa Grill.",

    "text": "For those of you that have par taken in Bobby Flay's Mesa grill in the past know what a good job they do with the cuisine. I often frequent this restaurant when in Vegas because most of these celebrity chefs aren't just names their talent really comes out in their food.   Unfortunately my last visit to the Mesa Grill was very unsatisfying. The attention to detail that you expect at a restaurant of this quality was not present. The waiters served the food without explanation or description. The Mojito was a cheap sweet and sour mix unlike the fresh Mojito previously served there with the hand smashed mint leaves. But despite all of that the quality of the food was not good. And I say this because I was eating the same dish (Yucatan Chicken Tacos). Unlike before there was little flavor or taste. I could have gotten a better meal from an L.A. gourmet food truck.   It appears that other people are running the establishment under his name or with the current state of the economy the Casino is putting the heat on them to cut corners. I will give Mesa Grill another try but for those prices the expectation level across the board should be high.",

    "text": "First of all, let me just say that I love Bobby Flay. This was a surprise visit from bf after I had said that I love Bobby. We wound up getting there pretty late (right around 10:30pm when their last seating is at 10:30). Even though we got there late, the hostesses were nice and sat us right away since we had a reservation.  Our server was an incredibly nice lady who was very attentive to our needs. She recommended a framboise beer for me since I was trying to decide what kind of drink to get. It wound up being pretty good. Bf ordered a Belgian White beer, forget what kind, and it was also pretty good.   Okay... food. Yum. We decided to go with a couple appetizers and an entree to do family style, since we wanted to try a lot of different things. Here are my thoughts:   -Roasted Corn Soup: omg this was amah-zing. It had a very complex taste, starting a bit on the sweet side, going to savory side, then ending with a somewhat sweet aftertaste. It was amazing.  -Rough Cut Tuna Nachos: this was probably one of the few factors bringing it down to a 4 star versus 5 star. Fresh ahi, garnished with an avocado and mango glaze, what I think is homemade tortilla chips, it was good, don't get me wrong. It was pretty ordinary though, although bf loved the mango glaze.  -Tiger Shrimp & Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale: grilled shrimp in some kinda creamy delicious sauce (I think it's creme fraiche, but not sure), with an incredibly yummy corn tamale. This was amazing. My only suggestion would be to add more shrimp. By the end of the dish we were out of shrimp but still had a substantial amount of tamale.  -Entree: New Mexico Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin: This was so yummy. Three perfectly portioned pieces of the perfect amount of pink, tender pieces (guess that's why they call it TENDERloin). But.. while the meat was deliciously cooked, the sauce and the rub were a bit overwhelming, particularly the rub.   Overall, this was a great experience. I love Bobby and I think it was a great experience to visit his restaurant. I'm sad I couldn't give it five stars, but I save five stars for restaurants where I have absolutely nothing negative to say about it, and due to the tuna nachos being somewhat mediocre and the tenderloin rub being too strong, I got to take the star away. I'd give it a five if Bobby were there though. ;) Would definitely come again.",

Seated in the top row of the restaurant we had a great view of the rests of the restaurant and most importantly straight on view of the kitchen. Started with the Shrimp Tamale & Tuna nachos.  ST was half tamale with 4 shrimp cooked on the grill with a great corn sauce with a little heat. The  tuna tare tare with chips and two different sauces.  For dinner we split the smoked pork tenderloin and a side of corn.  The Pork came as three round cuts about 3 inches tall and 1 inch thick. It was the pinkest pork I have ever had(it was smoked so not raw) and a wonderful sauce to dip into. The flavor nada nice heat in the crust of the pork and it was tender and juicy. The corn was great and we found the recipe on FN and it wasn't very heavy with cream. Service was wonderful without being over bearing. Best food we had in five days in Vegas.",

    "text": "OK, I am a sucker for Queso Fundido, so my dining experience was off to an incredible start. The fundido was hot, but not scathing and had a great consistency. Then the blue corn tortilla with duck. The duck just melted.    I ordered dinner, not thinking about how full I would be from the appetizers, but I powered through.  I ordered the 16 spice chicken. Just the right blend of spices (no I don't know what they were), the right amount of spicy, and the chicken was cooked perfectly.  So I was to full to have dessert.  My only complaint is that the staff stood around a lot, in full view. Which is really frustrating if you are waiting on something. As an added bonus we could hear them complain about other waitstaff, what they were doing after work... Really do that in the kitchen on on your own time. This knocks it down a star.",

I tried the Sixteen-Spice Chicken and that tasted a bit like deconstructed mole. The only reason that I was not thrilled is because the skin was just fatty, they did not crisp it enough for my liking so it kind of killed it for me a little.  My husband tried the pork loin dish and that was much better than mine. It came with a really tasty corn tamale (I'm usually not much of a fan).  We ended our meal with the banana creme dessert and that was really good :)",

Our server did a great job handling our table and the experience was VERY smooth.   It's not often that I eat sit down when I'm in Vegas... it's typically all buffets for me baby!!!! Anyways, this time around was a special occasion (crap, I don't remember what it was... if my wife reads this I may get in trouble), and we were not disappointed.   I had... what else, the RIB eye, it was great, tasted sweet to me, luckily I was in the mood for something sweet so it worked out PERFECT... those who may be more into savory meats vs. sweet meat should make note of this, as it may not be your cup of tea!   We had a quesadilla appetizer that was recommended to us by our server, but I think she may have hyped it up a bit too much... it was passable but nothing worth mentioning.   My wife had the filet, and it tasted to me like any filet does... BORING.   All in all, very well rounded joint. Great food and great service will make us repeats, but it's still going to have to compete w/ me always asking \"Should I just go gorge myself at the Bellagio Buffet instead?\"",

For starters we ordered the Tiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Corn Tamales- scrumptious is one word to describe it! This dish truly got my attention, Bobby! We also ordered Rough Cut Tuna Nachos- so refreshing and yummy. For our main courses we ordered the Southwestern Spice Chicken Skewer-grilled just right. Smoked Shrimp Tacos-very well seasoned and cooked to perfection not dry at all. Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich-a great panini type sandwich with fine dining quality. For desert we ordered the most amazing Banana Bread Pudding that left me speechless coz all I want to do is savor and eat it! The service we had was great and our server was very attentive. Ambiance has a very modern feel with lots of colored vase to reflect the southwestern theme of the place. This restaurant is definitely a must try when in Vegas!",

Not as great was the goat cheese queso fundito ( we love goat cheese and found it bland. ) and the lobster tacos were too small to deliver any discernable flavor. The cactus blossom marguerita was fun and tasty. Made a reservation for 4 Saturday afternoon and got right in at 7pm. We were staying there at Caesars in July 2013. Overall... the food is fun, bright, good portions and delivers what they advertise and believe in... As for price...expect $100 per person with drinks, apps and entree.

Server provided recommendations without needing to be asked.  Constant water refills when only partially empty.  Great service overall.  Items ordered: - Blue Corn Pancake w/ Duck BBQ -- this is my wife's absolute favorite item here, and it was ok but definitely not as good as in the past.  This alone is one of the primary reasons we keep coming back, so that was disappointing. - Tiger Shrimp w/ roasted corn tamale -- this was good, although there could have been more of it.  It's an appetizer though, so that's kinda the norm. - Entree - Shrimp tacos w/ avocado, tomatillo, mango sauces, citrus cilantro slaw.  This was a suggestion from the waiter.  Just average, nothing great.    Would not order this again. - Entree - Yucatan Chicken Skewers -- horribly disappointing. 3 tiny pieces of chicken with peanut chile aioli, with 2 tiny dried up tortillas.  I couldn't believe it was so bad.  Seating is very close quarters, to the point that it's uncomfortable trying to have a conversation.  You are literally in the conversations of people next to you, and while that may be an attractive feature of a family-style restaurant, it's not appropriate in this location.  Definite minus for that.  Mesa Grill has always been one of our \"must-go\" stops on previous trips.  We've been there twice before this visit, but both visits were for dinner.   This is the first time that the food was not stellar, and that's the only reason this is a 3-star review and not a 2.  Price is not an issue, because it's pretty standard for Vegas strip places and the food was always great previously and worth every penny.  We *might* go back next time we visit, but it's definitely off the \"I can't leave Vegas without going\" list.",

The drink I had contained gin and elderberry liquor with muddled cucumber - it was delicious. The sides were unfortunately small and my family were not really able to share them. They were delicious, however! The twice baked potato with horseradish and the plantain tamale were well made, but very small. The service was friendly and funny. My dad said to the waitress jokingly \"I expect Bobby to come by our table.\" The waitress brought one of the food runners, named Bobby, to our table. It was hilarious! Unfortunately, many of the Food Network Stars' restaurants don't live up to their names, but Mesa Grill has done so in my opinion - well done!",

Pros: - extremely efficient wait staff - tuna entree was excellent,5star - chilli rellenos was good, 4 star  Cons: - chopped salad was old lettuce and slightly wilted. Chopped tomatoes and canned kidney beans, canned chick peas and canned olives. The salad was dry and void of adequate dressing. After served by server our waiter saw it, and with a frown on forehead asked if we wanted more dressing before we could ask for it. The waiter did comp us the salad. Bobby Flay, \"Whats up for $17\" - White wine by the glass had 6 or 7 choices. I knew reisling but all other varietal choices were unrecognizable. Told wait person the wine choices were Greek to me. \"What was like a sauvignon blanc? The recommendation was not very good.  With all Vegas Strip food prices stratospheric, I think Mesa Grill is off our list. Tons of new options.",

My Review is for May 24, Brunch around 1pm  Tip: Men.....No hats, no beach wear, that's fine. Its a beautiful restaurant.   The Food is delicious... The service sucks. I mean to treat your patrons poorly and ignore us as if we didnt belong was SO disheartening. I am Such a Big Bobby Flay fan. His food is amazing but if you pair amazing food with Horrible customer service it KILLS the whole experience for the customer. I wanted to buy his sauces so i can get the full experience but  I just wanted to run from there. Any questions i attempted ask about the menu were dismissed and responded to in a condescending manner.   I came from Los Angeles just to eat here and how sad to be treated so poorly. Please hire some people who smile, and enjoy talking to people as Human beings, I never was offered a dessert menu, as the customers next to us were.   Is it bc i didnt order a aloholic drink?   We ordered, Chiliquilas- DELICIOUS Salmon- DELICIOUS Cactus pear Iced tea- DELICIOUS",

    "text": "Mesa grill is one of my favorites when I go to Vegas.  They have awesome food and the servers there are also awesome.  They take the time to go over specials and explain what items on the menu tastes like (on the night I went, it  was super busy).   Drinks:  The servers were raving about their margaritas, but I opted to get a dessert wine and got the weinlaubenhof kracher 08 ($16 per glass), which was very sweet, so if you're into that, must try!  Appetizers:  Blue corn lobster taco ($20). I basically like corn, so getting this taco was a given.   Baby romaine salad ($13), there is nothing that stands out about this salad and tasted generic, so you can save yourself 13 dollars and order something else.   Entrees:  Their 22 Oz bone in chipotle glazed rib eye ($48) was spot on.  Since it was a large piece of meat,  I opted for well done,  but slightly pink.  This turned out to be amazing. The meat was so soft and tender and it held in the juices and flavor very well. Also, to top it off the red and green chile sauce pairs perfectly with the slightly smoked taste of the meat.   Mango tuna steak ($38) is a fun little twist to your average steak. It had fun flavors like peppercorn, and pine nuts, cous cous to top off your steak. Can't go wrong with a little twist if executed right.   Desserts:  Brown butter carrot cake ($11) The cream cheese was so soft and it came with caramelized apples. It wasn't too sweet, but just enough to fulfill a dessert craving.  Churros ($11) come topped with cinnamon sugar and chocolate/coconut caramel dipping sauces. The texture of the churro did taste a little hard, but unsure if it was just that day or that's the nature of how the churro is made.",

Knowing how he creates recipes I was hopeful that the restaurant wasn't just successful due to his name, and I have to say that isn't the case. Coworkers at my table that have dined at all the great spots in Vegas said their steaks at Mesa were better. We had the blue pancake with BBQ duck, tiger shrimp tamale and crab cake for appetizer. All were outstanding. The duck was strongly seasons from the. BBQ sauce but not overpowering. The shrimp were perfect and the crab cakes meaty and cooked perfectly.  Most everyone orders a steak and all loved their selection. I had the chipotle glazed ribeye and it was amazing. Had a hint of sweetness and spice.  If you like horseradish, I recommend the double baked potato. Different, but fabulous. This was a meal I will always remember. Awesome job Bobby!  I've always wanted to try one of your establishments and was so happy that when I did it wasn't about celebrity, but about the obvious quality you've poured into MESA.",

I enjoyed the ranch tostada with eggs and crispy home fries and my hubby enjoyed the sweet potato poached egg with creamy grits.  The sides of chorizo and bacon were perfectly cooked with nice smoky flavor.  My daughter had the best quesadilla of her life and fresh squeezed orange juice.  I know brunch fare is usually boring but Mesa Grill makes it an experience.  Note it is located right behind the sports box at Caesars so if you love Sunday football this is the place to watch 10 screens while you have a gourmet brunch!!",

    "text": "I can't believe I'm giving Bobby Flay's restaurant 2 stars! First of all, I made a reservation and we got there early, and we had to wait longer than how early we were.  The decor is south western, it's ok, but there's cardboard on the ramp to our table- what's up with that?!   I don't like spicy food- if I did I'd probably like this place more. None of the main dishes appealed to me, so I ordered the corn tamale (appetizer) and the chile relleno (side dish) when I ordered that, the waiter said, sure if you're not that hungry. So then I got super worried that it was hardly any food and I ate tons of bread, which wasn't that good, in fact the corn bread was strait up nasty. The bread with nuts and raisins is really good though! The corn tamale is like corn bread mashed up and placed in an open corn husk so it looks pretty, but the tamales I buy off the street are better! The sauce on the tamale was pretty bomb though- I put some on my Chile relleno. The chile relleno was interesting. Instead of frying it in egg batter, it's covered in a corn meal and baked. It's stuffed with cheese and beans. It has an ancho chile sauce and sour cream. It's good, but I prefer the traditional version.  My mom ordered one of the steaks and she said it was the best stake she ever had- so there's that.  When dessert time came around- all I remember is that one of the choices was chocolate pudding-  pudding?! C'mon!   We went here because we like Bobby Flay, so you pay for the experience, I just thought it would have been better. :(",

I loved the corn muffins.  They had a peppers in them giving them something special.  We ordered the shrimp tamale appetizer as a side to the rib eye and also the lamb.  The shrimp tamale was very very good.  Our only issue was we did not eat it soon enough and it got cold.  It was much better warm.  Not a fault of the restaurant.  The rib eye was also good but the quality of meat was not the best.  Definitely go to a steak house if you want real good steak.  The lamb was alright.  It had a sweet flavor I did not care for.  It was also served with a tamale.  Warning!  The tamales are not real tamales but I enjoyed them.  The service was excellent.",

I tell him to make a reservation at this place right where he's staying, Ceasars palace, it's called Mesa Grill, it's that guy Bobby Flay's place, you know, that guy on Food Network that grills!  We meet up at the restaraunt and to tell you the truth the place seemed a little more casual than I expected, but it is in Vegas. Our waiter arrives, did a decent job serving us.  First drinks... There are only 4 beers served! ONLY FOUR BEERS! I ordered a Chimay Blue and my girl a Duval. $12 and $10 respectively. We decide to try a salad with apples, celery and some greens with this spicy sauce.  I was expecting to be surprised. I was. The salad bombed. if i was rating on solely the salad, Zero Stars. Now we get the New York strip, medium. The stake was cooked perfictly with a nice sear on the outside, juicy and flaverful on the inside. Now I don't want to seem like a cheapskate, take a look at some of my other reviews, but i just could not get over the price of the steak. $46 seems a bit excessive. I would have been comfortable with $38, there was nothing in that steak that said $46. And that doesn't even include any sides! The mash potatoes were $8 more! And were very tasty.  The bottom line for me, Over priced for what you get.  poor selection of beer (tasty ones, but no selection). Disappointing. I was really expecting more.",

I also had the brussel sprouts for the side w/ pomegranate seeds which were a little too sweet for my taste, like they were marinated in the juice. One thing I noticed was that the meats tend to come more undercooked than you would expect.  Someone ordered a medium well strip and it came out...red n bloody.  Not even pink.   It wasn't perfect but will deserve repeat visit...maybe.  But given a chance to check out something new I'd go there first before coming back to Flayland as I was somewhat expecting a little more. Prices are decent for such a marquee restaurant.  Just throw a bill down on BJ in the PCD pit outside and you'll be covered.",

I got the pork tenderloins which was the best pork dish I've ever had (see photos posted by others).  I didn't even know pork could be that tender.  My husband had the salmon dish which was pretty good but I've had better salmon dishes before.  Not a cheap place but definitely worth your money and actually not that expensive considering it's located in the Caesar's Palace on the Las Vegas strip.  Definitely worth a try!!!",

The decor was nice but our table felt like we were stuck in a corner (which we were), other staff workers were friendly and overall very good service/vibe from everyone but I am not here for the service or nice people I need to have my culinary taste buds get its ass kicked which unfortunately never happened... first disappointment was the menu, it had a fairly limited amount of items to choose from, Rib eye, pork chops, Tuna, Grouper among other disappoints the whole menu was filled with very common items you can get at almost any restaurant ....  I mean WTF where is the Iron chef I see on TV? I can get a grouper sandwich in Miami for $5.00, Second disappointment was my 22oz ribeye ordered medium rare and was server mostly raw, the one thing I hate is having to ask the water to send a steak back it kills the rhythm of the dinner and believe me I know the difference between Rare, medium rare and medium, My better half had the Tuna which was perfectly done but not that hard to accomplish since they lightly seared a sushi grade piece of tuna, Mashed potatoes OK but I could make them much better myself, cream corn was nice but where is the kick it up a notch? I felt like I was having dinner from a chef that just graduated from culinary school...   I must admit either the hype on TV is way over kill or BF dose not have his arms completely wrapped around the food coming out of the kitchen.... Appetizer, 2 drinks, bottled H20, 2 entrees & 3 sides tax and tip $250.00....",

We had dinner before seeing Cirque's \"O\".  The bread basket, as everyone says, is excellent.  I had the Partida margarita, simply divine.  My salad was great, with a little spice.  The spice rub pork tenderloin is the best pork I have EVER had.  It was so good, we raved about it so much, that the couple at the next table both ordered the pork tenderloin as well, and thanked us profusely for the recommendation!  I was a bit disappointed in the pear upside down cake for dessert.  It would only get 3 stars.  But the total experience is still 5 stars.",

I shared the Tiger Shrimp and Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale as an appetizer - very tasty! For my main dish, I had the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin. The pork tenderloin was great - really tender and pretty spicy (which I like). It was one of those dishes that you can't stop eating, even though you're way past full. My boyfriend had the 22 oz. Bone In Chipotle Glazed Rib-Eye. The steak was massive, but also really, really good. We don't have steak all that often, but if you're going to splurge for a night,  this is the place to get it.",

I complained to the waiter and he sent the manager over who comped me dessert, but I was disappointed in the dish and the fact that it wasn't served to me immediately when it was prepared.  For prices that are charged, I expect to have hot, just prepared food.  My companion's salmon was also very plain and not anything special, although it did arrive hot.  The desserts were good.

    "text": "I had high hopes when I stopped by Mesa Grill for lunch in October of '09.  One would think that, given Bobby Flay's status as a Iron Chef, his propensity to whore himself out for Food Network top billing, and his smattering of establishments around the country that the food would be appropriately awesome.  I wouldn't expect it to be, for example, Joel Robuchon or Thomas Keller good---but at least as good as any other celebrity chef restuarant in Vegas.  Mesa Grill, on the day I happened to dine there, was the worst restaurant I'd ever been to.  Easily.  I'm talking McDonald's bad.  Perhaps even Subway bad.    The service was slow and forgetful.  There was plenty of staff to go around so nobody was over-committed with tables.  They were just slow.  And forgetful.  And slow.  I ordered a chicken and blackbean quesadilla for an appetizer.  I followed that with the spicy pork sandwich.  Both dishes were bland.  Very, very boring and bland.  There was no spice.  There was little flavor.  The presentation was tired, the flavors were muted, and the texture of all the food reminded me of fish cooked under a heat-lamp and then microwaved.  My pork sandwich was cooked RARE and served COLD.  Really?  I can understand, perhaps, serving the meat at room temperature but a cold, raw, pork sandwich shouldn't be served to dogs, much less paying guests.  The decor is nice.  The location is nice.  The drinks are good.  The menu has a nice selection---which serves to trick you into thinking the food is actually tasty, hot, and worth money.  If this restaurant is in any way representative of the Bobby Flay line of establishments then our dear Iron Chef needs to spend more time being a chef and less time playing one on TV.    I would never recommend anyone go here.  Trust the food blogs, critics, and professionals who have given Mesa Grill consistently low marks over the course of its Vegas run---it truly is a terrible restaurant and an embarassment to \"spicy\" and \"flavorful\" cuisine everywhere.  Shame on you Bobby Flay.  Shame.",

    "text": "First time I was here, I ordered the pork tenderloin and I'd say it was pretty close to a religious experience.  If I was of a certain faith that didn't allow me to eat pork, then this dish would make me think about committing that sin.  But then that lifestyle would also mean no bacon, so I'd wind up in H-E-double-hockey-sticks faster than you can say \"delicious\" anyway.  But I digress.  Second time I was here, I ordered the tuna for the sake of trying something new.  I felt as though it was missing something, and while the quality of the tuna itself was decent, the flavor wasn't quite what I had in mind.  I stole a few bites from my friend who had the rib-eye.  I had food envy.  Stick to the meat dishes if you can.  And their salads aren't that memorable and possibly a waste of real estate in your stomach.  If buffet strategy has taught you anything, that real estate is precious.  I was going to give 3 stars, but because they were accommodating when we had to change our reservation in the last minute, I'd say they get 0.5 more star (there was a little bit of 'tude typical of hosts).  Oh hell, I'm just rounding it up.  4 stars.",

    "text": "We went to Mesa Grill for my nieces 21st Bday dinner. I had heard great things and was very excited.... But left a bit disappointed. We had. 6:45pm reservation and were seated within minutes. Our service was initially pretty good and then went downhill along with some of the food. We ordered the 1st bottle of wine and wanted a few appetizers to go with it. The waiter stated we had to order wine, apps, and all of our entrees at the same time. I felt rushed and the waiter was irritated that we hadn't selected our entrees at this point. After ordering everything, we saw him maybe 2 more times in 2 hrs.... Even pouring our own wine from the bottle. Not that I have a problem with that but when your entree costs $50 usually the waiter keeps your glassed filled.   Food rundown:  Apps: Queso Fundido was excellent with goat and Monterey jack cheeses $15 Tiger Prawn Tamale was just ok.... 3 or 4 shrimp total...  Not worth $17 Quesdilla was awesome and worth the $12ish price  Entrees and sides: My sister had 2 app size chile  rellenos for her entree. There is a ente size chili relleno but the waiter said it was a big bell pepper?? Call me crazy but chili relleno is supposed to be made with a large chili?? At any rate the app size chili relleno was weird. First of all it looks like a large jalepeno popper sans the cheese. It was filled with dry black beans and came with a corn meal crust... No sauce.. No cheese. Mt sister requested cream fraiche on the side... With a smirk from the waiter.  3 others in our party ordered the Tuna Steak entree. While tasty it requires a steak knife for the medium rare.. Again a complete smirk from our now very rude waiter.  I had the Porterhouse Lamb chops. To be honest is is the only thing that is making me give Mesa Grill 2 stars. There were 2 huge chop cooked perfectly to med rare and tasted amazing!   Sides: all sides cost $8 Mashed Potatoes were good but very small and $8 for a single serving Brussels sprouts were tasty Sauteed spinach was generously average  My overall experience was just ok... If the service had been par with the prices and for our celebration I might feel differently. Order the lamb and stay away from the app chili relleno.  6 ppl with 5 entrees and 2 bottles of wine... $450.00 plus gratuity.",

    "text": "Surprisingly unimpressed. I am a huge fan of Bobby Flay and nothing really impressed me about Mesa Grill. There were three of us in our group and although the meals looked appetizing, our selections were just OK. I had the grilled lamb porterhouse chops with the plantain tamale dish. The lamb was well cooked and the plantain tamale was very nice, but once again completely unimpressed ... specially for the price. Our bill was $180 with tip and all three of us left Mesa Grill completely dissatisfied and we all agreed that we would not return. What made it even more dissatisfying was the impersonal staff. Our waiter rushed through our visit and didn't even take the time to explain the menu. They definitely run a tight ship here and there are no accommodations if you are early or late or if you're are missing part of your group. We were there on time, but the group on front of us was made to wait because they were a few minutes early.   The one reason why this review gets 3 stars (instead of 2) is because of the delicious dessert we had. My wife had the Sticky Toffee Pudding and it was heavenly. Exactly what you expect from a fine dining restaurant - I highly recommend it.  Here are the pros and cons based on our visit. Pros: great location, nice wine and beer selections, dessert options. Cons: Overpriced, limited menu,  limited dietary options, unfriendly and unaccommodating staff.",

The caviar-topped oyster appetizer (on special, won't be there long -- go now!) was honestly the best thing I think I've ever eaten in my life. I could eat 100 of those. I ordered the Cioppino for my main course and it was crazy good --  huge pieces of fresh seafood, amazing broth flavor. My husband ordered the tuna and it was also excellent (though, I think mine won). We both had margaritas and then I had wine and he had beer, all excellent.   The servers were amazing -- yes, plural. We had at least four come to our table for different purposes, all were super friendly and helpful (and funny!). They made us feel really welcome and taken care of. The ambiance of the restaurant was warm and inviting. Even though it was packed, with the extreme height of the ceilings, it wasn't overly loud and my date and I could easily hear each other. We will definitely be making a return visit to this restaurant next time we're in Vegas. Thanks, Bobby Flizzal. :)",

No reservation but not a problem since they open at 10:30.  I asked what \"cactus pear\" tasted like, and the waiter couldn't describe it. So I took a leap and got it anyway, it was delicious but the best part was that they gave me a mini-carafe of simple syrup to sweeten it with!!  Yeaaaaaah.  The little things.  Anyway, I was really eying up the chilaquiles but the waiter recommended the steak and eggs instead. What a mistake. So yeah, while the steak was cooked properly, the TORTILLAS WERE STALE. Nearly inedible! And I LOVE tortillas! And the bell pepper 'salsas' that it came with were cold and smushed together. The guac was brown. Just BLEH.  $60 brunch and I didn't even get good tortillas or a good 'salsa' which I always see Bobby Flay coming up with.  Ugh.",

I found him off-putting from the start in a way I couldn't quite pinpoint.  Throughout the meal, however, he was absent at best and rude at worst.  Several times, I made eye contact with him and he walked right past our table.  He never checked in with us and when I asked him for the check, he nodded, placed it on our table after an interval and returned it without so much as a \"thank you\" or \"have a nice day.\"  In a service town, I'm surprised he has a job.  Maybe just a bad day?  The food!  It was good with some great mixed in.  We started with the Smoked Chicken Quesadilla which was the highlight of our meal.  Delicious smokey flavor, great guacamole and a tangy habanero (?) sauce.  Really good and very filling.  This could certainly be an entree, especially at lunch when we went.  My fella enjoyed the Smoked Shrimp Tacos.  Nothing outstanding but good.  I had the Lamb Cobb Salad.  The components of the salad were tasty but the presentation was an absolute mess.  Also, the massive size of the salad dwarfed the portion of lamb.  Ill-conceived but again, tasty.  I'm not opposed to going back to Mesa Grill since there were many other menu items that looked appealing.  I have to say, however, that in a city with so much competition from other restaurants, there are some areas they could tighten up.",

In the celebrity chef throw down, Bobby Flay beat Emeril hands down!    The decor was upscale approachable.  You could wear nice jeans and a nice shirt and feel comfortable here.  I only wish it were not right in the casino.  Although the restaurant is beautifully decorated with nice details, if you look  beyond the glass windows, you could see the betting monitors.  Mesa Grill needs a better location...maybe in the Forum near Spago's where the view is much nicer.   My friend and I started with Blue Corn Lobster Tacos appetizer.   The order gives three mini tacos, but wow!  Those little guys are packed with flavor!!  I could eat 20 of those!  Not for that price though.  Haha.  We each ordered an entree and splitted them.  My Coffee-Rubbed Filet Mignon was spectacular.  It was cooked perfectly, melt in your mouth tender, and so full of depth from the coffee rub.  The mushroom-ancho chili sauce was the perfect rustic accompaniment with its rich, deep flavors.  My friend's entree of New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin was out of this world!  I have never eaten a pork tenderloin like that.  It was still pretty pink, but I trusted that Bobby Flay knew what he was doing and wouldn't give me salmonella.  Well, I'm glad I went for it, because that pork was as tender as the filet mignon.  I seriously could not tell the difference in tenderness between the too.  For dessert, we shared the Chocolate Pretzel Tart.  For me, the best part of that dessert was the spicy peanut butter ice cream that came with it.  The heat was not a smack in the face type of heat, but rather a slow warm heat in the back of your throat.  The tart was a pretzel cylinder with a pool of chocolate sauce.  In the \"moat\" was what tasted like a flourless chocolate cake.  Delicious!    Overall, what I really liked was Bobby  Flay's command of spices.  If something was described as spicy, it was always a deliberately controlled amount of spiciness that just slowly warmed the back of your throat and lingered.  it was a beautiful orchestration of flavors blending into a perfect symphony.   Truly amazing.",

    "text": "I have an insane foodie crush on Bobby Flay's flavors, so this review may be colored by that fact. But hey, if you like Southwestern flair even a little bit, you cannot possibly go wrong with this restaurant.  We ordered a ton of food. Most delicious and memorable was the lobster street tacos (three tiny little nuggets of heaven, and the pickled habanero relish on top was fantastic). Also delicious and memorable: my chile relleno (Who batters it with cornmeal batter and stuffs it with eggplant? Bobby Flay does. Swoon.), mom's sweet potato soup appetizer (silky smooth, perfect flavors), and the quesadilla appetizer. I got a white peach virgin margarita, too, and it was DELICIOUS.  Dessert was sticky toffee pudding (not really Southwestern, ha), and it was very tasty, though a little too boozy. Cornish Pasty Co. of Tempe, AZ still has it beat, but it was definitely a good pud.",

They sat our party of four at a round table, but we decided we would be more cozy at a square table.  No questions asked, DONE!  I like that.    Drinks: Margaritas were ordered which were a bit on the sweet side.  Appetizers: Sea Scallops with mixed greens.  Standard flavors, big plump pieces.  Shrimp Tamales Very good.  Southwest flavors, that's what Flay is known for.  Reminiscent of an over the top Chevy's tomalito.  Spicy Tuna Tartare Not spicy.  Fresh, but not anything special.    Entrees: Pork Tenderloin Very tender, lean meat, moist and came paired with a wonderful twice baked tomato!  Salmon Good, could have been better.    Seabass No one was a fan of this entree.  Overseasoned and tough.  Final thought a la Jerry Springer: Stick with the southwest cuisine and the BBQ.",

    "text": "I get nervous going to a celebrity chef's restaurant. People love their shows, their recipes and even their TV personality, so the excellence of their restaurant and food are normally blown way out of proportion. However, with Mesa Grill, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I was wrong in thinking the food was going to be simply mediocre and left more than satisfied with the 1000+ calories I had just happily consumed.  When I sat down I immediately told the server that I was gluten-free. Without flinching, he told me that most of the food is gluten-free, but if not, they can substitute the sides, etc, so I won't become ill. This was most relieving since 1/2 the restaurants I have gone to in Vegas don't know what gluten-free means, so this was a great start to the meal.  After watching the show \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate: Vegas,\" I had to come and try the tiger shrimp tamale. I asked the server if it was gluten-free and he said absolutely. My fiance told him to definitely get a start on that tamale with a massive smile on his face and the server obliged. However, before he left he told us about the specials and showed how real restaurants should be training their staff. Very professional. Very friendly. Very fantastic.  Oh the Tiger Shrimp. I could bathe in the sauce. I envisioned myself swimming in it last night. I could put it on everything and even though my heart would scream each day, it would be worth the Lipitor. Great flavors, fresh, succulent shrimp and just a small amount of heat. If you are not a fan of garlic, stay away, because unlike the heat, there was a plentiful amount of garlic to keep any creepy Twilight vampire away for years.  I cannot say very much about the chile relleno my fiance ate because 1. It was not gluten-free, but most importantly, 2. It was gone in ten minutes. The ONLY reason it took him that long to eat the chile was because we had just eaten a massive corn tamale and split a bottle of wine. Also, once in a while we try to act like we're classy and not inhale our food. All I know is that seeing the cheese slowly pouring out of the chile when he broke the shell reminded me why I love cheese and why it is so dang good.  I ordered the spicy chicken. When you place the words, spicy, chicken and hollandaise sauce all in the same sentence I will pounce on whatever it is IMMEDIATELY. The fact that I was in a breakfast mood was only boosted by the perfectly poached egg on top. Texture city and oh the flavors! Even though I wish it was actually spicy (please note that I am Korean and burn my tastebuds off every other day with chili paste), it was really perfect. First, I picked off a couple pieces of the chicken and then just broke into that poached egg and let it smother the spicy chicken in its happiness. Then I would roll a forkful around in the green hollandaise and all cravings, protein, brunch and fatty goodness were satisfied in one quick bite. It took me a long time to eat it because I was still full from the tamale, but you can't take a poached egg as a leftover while walking around in 100 degree weather. I was forced to eat it all. For shame.  You should go here. Great service, the food is creative, colorful and absolutely solid. You will be full, satisfied and leave from this restaurant content and rubbing your belly in sheer delight as you muffin top your way back to your room and pass out from a pleasant food coma.",

    "text": "\"F***ing Bobby Flay!\" So says Ari Gold from the last season of Entourage. Yup, why's the Grill Master have to have food so good that I keep coming back every time I'm in town? I didn't realize till recently that after all these visits to Mesa, I've never written a review.   Here are some brunch items I've tried: Any of the quesadillas they have on the menu. I had the crispy bacon and hash brown quesadilla.  Spicy chicken and sweet potato hash - Good portions and a nice southwest twist on the regular corned beef hash. Mesa burger - A sign of a good burger for me is one that needs no condiments, is juicy, and has a soft bun. This burger has it. I'm a sucker for pastries so their brunch bread basket is SOOO delicious. The mini fresh scones were the best! The cactus pear iced tea was really refreshing as well and not too sweet. Based on my last waiter's suggestion, I'll have to try the steak and eggs next time.  Here are my thoughts on dinner items I've tried: Cremini mushroom quesadilla - I order this every time! Tiger shrimp corn tamale - Heard great things about it but was only Ok. New Mexican spiced rubbed pork tenderloin - A very solid choice with just the right amount of heat. Pork is very tender. Fire roasted veal chop - This is my fav! I still need to try the bone-in ribeye at some point.  You can ask for a side of their special chipolte sauce. It's great for dipping with the quesadillas or even your fries. I finish my dinner off usually with the deep dish banana cream pie. Never disappoints and guarantees that I end my dinner on a high note.  Staff and service are always top notch. There's a side room that can be reserved for larger parties. Beverages are constantly refilled. Margaritas are tasty, but a bit on the pricier side. Food is always solid. Portions are just right. Price is not unreasonable. I'm always satisfied.  Reservations are recommended.",

Is that blood dripping down my chin?  I love Bobby Flay.  I have naughty, naughty dreams about the man that simply are not discussed in any detail outside my therapist's office.  Though my suggestion to The Bud that we consider making reservations there came off as totally casual, devil-may-care, my insides were screaming, \"Please, if you love me, you will take me here!\"  We only visited once this trip, but it was our third visit to the restaurant, and it was completely perfect in every way.  Atmosphere is fiery, service attentive, food is creative, and unique.  The white peach margarita was delicious and boozy.  The sweet potato soup was beautifully spiced.  The NY strip steak was perfectly medium rare.  And huge.  And served with a house made steak sauce that made me whimper a little.  As mentioned above, I had to take half of it with me to be, um, devoured later, in the dark.  What?  Shut up.  Just go here already.  And if you see Bobby Flay, do me a favor and don't tell me.  I couldn't handle it.",

I seriously thought I would get blown away by the food but his steak tasted pretty much like any other steak you could buy at Longhorn steak house. As for the mashed potatoes well, they taste like all mashed potatoes should taste like.

The food is way overpriced for what you get.  You're basically paying for the name instead of quality food.  Basic cocktails are $12+.  Desserts are $11 and not big enough to share (no I'm not a pig either).    I ordered the pork tenderloin which was $36 for 3 tiny pieces (c'mon, it's not sushi!) and a very dry tasteless \"tamale\".  My dad and my wife had the turkey dinner for $38, again very small portions and they later told me it was cold!  My 12 year old son had the salmon which he really enjoyed, but for $32 can't you at least include 1 side??!!  The best thing I can say about the restaurant is the bread basket!  The waiter warned us of the \"spicy\" bread which was not spicy at all - just a couple bits of jalapeno, but the cheese crust was delicious.  The service was ok, but nothing special.  It took forever to get our food (we were there for 2 hours), but I can understand that due to the holiday.  The icing on the cake was walking out and nobody at the hostess bar said thanks for coming.  After dropping $280 for 3 adults and 3 kids, I will definitely not be back!",

It is not so much a restaurant as it is a chemistry experiment.  The dishes here that are good are interesting combinations of favors I haven't had before.  Because this restaurant seems to me just an experiment to test people's tolerance for someone's best idea for a crazy chem-lab you'll have to go to try for yourself.  It isn't southern anything.  It is lunar.",

    "text": "I have a friend who's nemesis is Bobby Flay.  So I wanted to make sure we ate there.  The Bellagio buffet was packed, so I called last minute to make a brunch reservation for 11.  After about an hours wait in the comfy lounge chairs, we were seated.  Service was a bit slow throughout our meal, but I was just glad we were able to get a table for so many with such short notice.  The bread basket was delicious, with bite-size jalapeno cheese cornbread, mini cranberry scones, and coffee cake.  For appetizers, I tried the Bacon Queso Quesadilla w/ fried egg, which was okay, and the Tiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale, which was awesome.  The sauce, the jumbo shrimp, the tamale... everything was delicious and went well together.  I think I would've just been happy having a larger portion as my main entree.  I felt like a burger and since Bobby Flay is a burger fan, I figured I'd give the Mesa Burger a shot.  The burger patty itself was thick and super juicy, but it was a bit bland.  But the horseradish mayo and grilled onions helped.  The southwestern fries were pretty good, but didn't think they were as addicting as the server mentioned.  I think I'm still thinking about the parmesan truffle fries from a certain steakhouse.  In the end, I was stuffed and enjoyed my meal.  If I were to come back, I think it would definitely be for dinner, since the brunch menu was limited in choices.",

It was amazingly delicious and what you come to expect from Bobby Flay with his spicy flair. Just the right amount of heat, zest, and lightness.    For an entree,  I chose the \"New Mexican Spiced Tenderloin Sandwich\". This was sadly underwhelming.  Thin slices of pork and not crazy pork flavor.  Dessert, we shared a nice big piece of a coconut cake. I'm not a big coconut type of person but this dessert was amazing. Great deep and rich flavors.",

The boyfriend has the clam chowder and said it was delicious, I couldn't try it because they add some bacon and I don't eat meat. He had the tostada and said it was also very flavorful. They also offer you a basket of different types of breads, which we ate throughout our lunch and they were all so tasty! I really enjoyed all the different flavors and small details in the dishes.

I never expected to have a thigh with my chicken for the price.   Never ate the thigh but breast was dry as well.  They tried to make right for my partner and did not charge her. I though maybe it was just her because I can eat anything so I tried her pork tenderloin it was so dry I could not eat it.   Too many great food places for us to ever go back there.  Hope they listen and get a chef who knows how to do southwestern food and make it moist.",

We really did enjoy the food a lot and had some tasty tequila cocktails. The Tiger Shrimp appetizer was great, very bold flavors. We also had the pork dish which was cooked to perfection, amazing.

We were on a time-crunch and the wonderful team at Mesa Grill managed to have us seated within five minutes of our arrival, and out the door within 20 minutes!   Swift service didn't mean they compromised on quality though! We ordered the Smoked Shrimp Tacos and the Ancho Chile-Honey Glazed Salmon and both of these were honestly some of the best dishes I've ever tasted. The Smoked Shrimp Tacos brought fresh, simple flavors that complemented each other beautifully. Each element on the salmon dish was absolutely outstanding, but the glaze on the salmon was a clear standout. It was spectacular and could easily have carried the dish all on its own!   Delectable cuisine supported by an efficient kitchen and courteous staff resulted in an overall positive experience. I fully intend to indulge myself by dining here at least once more during my trip!  - We went back to Mesa Grill another 3 times during our trip and remained equally impressed! On our last visit, I got the Cornmeal Crusted Chile Relleno and it met my incredibly high expectations of a dining experience at Mesa Grill!",

A few negatives I will get out of the way first -  I ordered two of the \"signature\" margaritas - Partida and a Don Julio Reposado. The partida was utterly boring and had no alcohol, yet this is one of their most popular drinks. The Reposado was better at least since it was just the don julio and mix. My friends also ordered a mix of drinks and they weren't the best and one friend didn't even bother drinking hers.   Now for everything that made this a great meal!  The entire staff we encountered - hostess, busser, and waitress - were all fantastic! Friendly, fast, and provided the best service!   We started the table with the goat cheese queso and red chile bbq duck. the queso was ooey gooey and rich with cheese! the peppers were roasted well but really had no big wow flavor throughout. the blue corn chips had nice flavor though and were warm, crispy, and fresh. the duck was amazing. tender and juicy with the crunchy cracklings and soft johhny cake.   For my main dish, I ordered the New Mexican spice rubbed Pork Tenderloin marinaded with bourbon and ancho chile and a side of a sweet potato tamale.  the tamale was alright, I kind of wish I ordered the plantain tamale as a substitute, but the masa was soft and moist.  Now this pork . . . WOW ordered medium rare and cooked to absolute perfection! tender, juicy, cuts like butter, melts in your mouth like butter, oh so good and the spiced crust added so much amazing flavors but was not spicy or over done at all!  Thank you MESA!",

    "text": "I was recently in Las Vegas with a bunch of my closest women friends - \"girls weekend\" in Vegas with all of us celebrating our upcoming 50th birthdays.  Anyway, we were doing a lot of wandering about the strip on our last night, and we stumbled across this restaurant. I immediately lost my mind as I LOVE Bobby Flay!  I completely forgot to look up restaurants ahead of time, so this was thrilling for me to come across it accidentally.   I bargained with them to have a late dinner (taking time out of our wanderings). We wandered in on a Saturday night around 8:30pm and were lucky enough to get the last large table.  All of us were having a hard time deciding what to order because everything on the menu looked AMAZING.  We ended up asking the waiter for guidance.    For an appetizer, he suggested the Tiger Shrimp which he advised had won awards.  Since there were five of us, I ordered two.  I wish I'd ordered five.  They were AMAZING.  They also brought out a bread basket full of blue corn muffins and asiago bread which was very good as well.  We all decided to have a different entree so we would have the benefit of being able to try all the dishes.  I ordered the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin (picture below).  It comes with a bourbon-ancho chili sauce drizzled over it and a sweet potato tamale with crushed pecan butter.  Honest to go, I swear on my Mother, this had to be the best pork I've had in my life.  There was so much flavor, and a nice little kick to it.  The tamale was not too sweet, but enough to take the edge off the spice on the pork.  If I could've gotten away with licking the plate, I would have.  My wife ordered the lamb chops, and honestly, i was afraid to get my hands or fingers anywhere near her plate.. Lamb chops are her favorite thing to eat, and she has always said that Morton's Steakhouse had the best she'd ever had.. until now.  She said Mesa Grill made Morton's look like Burger King (if BK served lamb chops - LOL).  The other girls had the 16 spiced rubbed chicken, the mahi mahi and the salmon.  All conversation stopped at the table, and it was really just a series of moans.    We were all so full, and I was bummed because the desserts looked outstanding.  We opted to share an order of the homemade churros because there were conveniently five to an order. They were fluffy and light and just the perfect amount of sweet to end an awesome night.   I don't go to Vegas often at all, but I would fly back there just to eat at Mesa Grill again.  Our server, Mike F, was entertaining, efficient and professional.. We all enjoyed him very much.  I believe one of my friends has a selfie with him floating around on Facebook.    If you are in Vegas, take the time to eat here.",

We were a two top so we were seated at the cattle tables as I like to refer to them...you know where you are sitting on top of strangers so much so that you could share a dish? I was facing the wall so there was zero atmosphere for me to take in...just my Mom's beautiful face and red orange wall. To make matters worse as far as the cattle table is concerned, the people to the right of us were not fond of each other so they weren't speaking, they preferred to listen to our conversation. At one point the woman physically turned her body towards us and was looking at us while we were dining. EXTREMELY uncomfortable.   Our server had a bit of an attitude that I didn't appreciate.  I heard him suggesting the Halibut to the table next to us. When he came to our table I asked him what he thought of the Mahi-Mahi. He told me, \"you already heard that I prefer the Halibut.\" Ok, yes, I did. First of all, you weren't speaking to us so I shouldn't be held accountable for your recommendation to another table and second of all, I didn't ask you to compare the Mahi to the Halibut, I asked how it was. I didn't care for him so I went with my own instincts and got the Mahi, which was delicious! The rice it is served with was also delicious!  My Mom got a chopped salad which I tried and it was extremely tasty! She also got the crab cake appetizer as her meal. It was very good but extremely overpriced. $24 for a crabcake appetizer that had one small crab cake with some garnish.   We got churros for dessert. My Mom really liked them. They were very soft. I prefer a crispy churro so I didn't like them as much but they weren't bad. I just didn't love the texture. They are served with two dipping sauces. The chocolate dipping sauce is delicious!   We did receive a bread basket with a few different breads. They were kind of spicy. Nothing too memorable.   The waiter near us was big on dropping Bobby Flay's name as if they are best friends which was kind of obnoxious.   We came on a Saturday so I had to give my credit card information in order to reserve a table. If we did not show up or if we canceled under 24 hours notice, we would have been charged a fee. $50 I believe.   I can't really comment on anything in regards to atmosphere because our seating did not give me the opportunity to take in any of the restaurant's  atmosphere. I honestly can't even tell you what it looks like. It was kinda loud. There were lots of people. I think there were tvs.   I would return purely because the food was so delicious but I wouldn't make it a point to come here every time I visit Vegas like I would with some other places. I would much prefer going somewhere where the food, service AND atmosphere are all enjoyable...not just the food. It's worth giving it a shot...you might have a better table and a better server which will make a big difference in your overall experience!",

It's got a rich Southwestern flavor and appeared on \"Best Thing I Ever Ate\" for a reason. Other than that item, most everything is good but far from top-notch.  If you like a little spice in your brunch, this is as good a spot as any.",

It's nice to see everything's  remained consistent and fantastic.  The service and attention to detail is top notch.  We 'ate' at another chef's restaurant who has definitely taken his eye off the ball.  Bobby's doing it right with those he hires to trust his brand.  We love his restaurants and his books.  He never disappoints and cares about his brand.  Is it wrong to love Bobby from afar? If so, I'm seriously guilty.  His food and his dining experience makes life an amazing experience.  Hats off to his staff in Las Vegas.  You made us very happy with the meal and the memories. xo",

    "text": "We chose Mesa Grill for our last dinner in Vegas. I'd heard so much great stuff about it, but turns out it was just okay.  As you'd expect with pretty much any upscale restaurant in a large Vegas hotel, the decor is over the top and the prices match. The food, while beautiful, didn't have the flavor to match its appearance.  The complimentary bread basket they brought us looked great and included garlic jalapeno bread, corn muffin (made with swirled blue and yellow cornmeal), and walnut raisin bread. The muffins were dry and pretty bland. The two breads were tasty, though.  What had sold me on coming here was the dish that Flay is supposedly known for--the tiger shrimp and roasted garlic corn tamale. The shrimp and tamale were quite delicious, but the creamy sauce covering the whole dish was way salty and totally killed it for us.  The smoked chicken and black bean quesadilla was pretty dang smoky, which is not my jam (that was my own fault, though--it's right there in the name).  The cornmeal crusted chile relleno was beautiful, and had great crunch with the cornmeal coating, but some of the eggplant was undercooked and the flavors weren't really doing it for me.  The far and away highlight of the evening was the cauliflower gratin with roasted poblano. ORDER THIS! Super creamy and cheesy, with a really nice crisped top, loads of flavor, cooked to perfection. This dish is a contender for best thing I ate this Vegas trip. So good!  The service was good.  My husband would like to take this opportunity to register his complaint about the men's restroom: the urinals were ridiculously close together with no divider. \"If you weren't careful, you could run into each other!\" So, there's that.",

Our first restaurant in Vegas and they were able to take us for lunch without a reservation. My husband and I both aren't too keen on the whole Tex-Mex food menu but this restaurant converted us and made us a huge fan. For starters, our waiter and the entire crew is very sweet and friendly, very accommodating. Quick service and phenomenal food. The portions are perfectly sized and every bite is packed with a punch of flavor. Huge round of applause. Never does my husband ask for a desert menu but here he did, even before finishing his entree. We will definitely be back! 5 stars for sure!!",

The squash blossoms were good but I don't know if I'd get them again. The chopped salad was okay. Good mixture of flavors and textures.   Highlights: Hands down Best Tomato Soup. The boyfriend was impressed at how satisfied he was with the lowly chicken dish (he was in love with it!). $50 the course meal is a great deal. The coconut cake was good even after accompanying us around Vegas, spending a night in our hotel room sans fridge, and making the trip from Vegas back to San Diego in 100+ degree weather... (don't judge).  We will absolutely be back.",

I asked the waiter what I should order and he told me \"Hands down, get the shrimp tacos.\" I have had better shrimp tacos from the $5 taco stand that's a block from my apartment. Spending $25 on fish tacos that were NOTHING special was disappointing. Maybe my expectations were to high, but my advice is to skip the shrimp tacos and order something more unique.",

    "text": "My friend and her younger sis wanted to go to Bacchanal. They were at capacity and one of the hostesses told the group ahead of us that they were not taking any more people. Did we just get rejected at the Buffet? LOL. Truth be told, I was a bit relieved since I didn't want to eat at a buffet that night. Since we were already at Caesar's Palace and we had plans to go to XS that night, we ended up at Mesa Grill. We got seated immediately by the nice, smiling hostess. I'm surprised they let me in because I looked like a bum that day with my jean shorts and bright tank top.  We started off with an assortment of bread-jalapeno, jalapeno corn muffin, a nutty bread, and sourdough? I didn't taste all the bread so my bread descriptions suck. Of course, I need an adult beverage so I ordered Duvel, a golden ale. I love my Belgian beers! It was Restaurant Week at the time so my friend and her sis ordered something from the RW menu. Nothing really caught my eye on the RW menu so I decided to get the Ancho-Chile honey-glazed salmon (cooked medium). We shared the tuna nachos with mango, habanero hot sauce, & avocado crema for an appetizer. Wow, get the tuna nachos!  My friend and her sister ordered the chopped salad, grilled Berkshire pork porterhouse chop, Sixteen Spiced chicken, Tres Leches cake, and the salted caramel chocolate pudding. My salmon was cooked perfectly with the slight crispiness and flakiness on the outside and slightly under cooked and tender in the middle. It's exactly the way I prefer my salmon. The bold Southwestern flavor combination had a slight kick and all the flavors of black beans, tomatillos, and roasted jalapeno crema blended well together. Not only did it taste amazing, the bold, vibrant colors were so pretty to look at. I had a bite of everything. Every single thing was delicious! To end the meal, the salted caramel chocolate pudding put a smile on my face. it was so decadent and not overly sweet. I wanted to lick the bowl but that wouldn't look right in public so I didn't.   Our server Joel was professional, friendly, courteous, and even noticed my friend spilled some sticky sugar water on her purse and wiped if off for her. We all didn't notice. I didn't pay too much attention to the decor. It just looks like any fancy restaurant on the Strip. I did notice most people were dressed so I felt slightly uncomfortable there with my casual attire. If I had known I was coming here, I would have dressed up!  Mesa Grill is a prime example of what a celebrity chef's restaurant on the Strip should be - world class service from all employees as well as a fancy, clean atmosphere to enjoy your delicious, pricey Vegas meal!",

It was a nice surprise to find that the service and the food are great.  Service is efficient and attentive without being fussy and annoying.   Be sure to have the tuna nachos. Sushi style maguro chopped into a tartare and drizzled with amazing habanero and herb sauces served with house made corn and flour tortilla chips. It's truly awesome.  Our entrees were excellent as well.   A nice experience in Vegas.",

The rating was for the service was a 5 for me and the food a solid 3.5 the Capitol Grill in Jacksonville has a better feel, service, and food.  I recommend it just so you can say I was at Bobby's place but not a regular place to go when I am sure there are MUCH better places like the Eiffel Tower Restaurant , Now this place is Awesome!",

The server took over 5 minutes to first approach the table and did not greet us in a friendly  manner nor did he provide any info on menu items. We received  water quickly but didn't get the bread until we had to ask for it from the bus boy and our dishes had already been brought out.  For the food we ordered the chicken quesadilla,  lobster tacos, and blue corn pancake with duck. Everything was delicious. No complaints  about the food at all.  The server never checked on us again. He didn't ask if everything came out ok or if  we needed anything.  The bus boy should be the server because he was much more attentive.  It took a long for the dishes to get cleared and we had to grab him to ask for tne check because  he never came back!  Then it took 15 mins to get the check.  He passed by our table 5 times  before that.  Upon leaving the hostess didn't give us a farewell  greeting.   I absolutely  expect more from a restaurant  of this level.  I don't know if we were neglected  because we were young or what but  the service was incredibly  disappointing.",

His recommendations where excellent.  All of the staff that were supporting him where equally awesome.  Professional and service orientated.   I have the smear appetizer, which was great.  I don't really like avocado, but I took a chance, because it is Bobby's House.  Each bite was full of flavor and I wished that I had more!  The bread that came out was good, but the jalapeno bread was really good.  Not spicy, but had great flavor.  I ordered the salad as a side, it was good.  I wish the menu listed the veggies in the salad, I would have asked for no olives.  Even with me picking out the olives, it was still a good salad.  The pork, was amazing.  It cut easily, had some heat, but nothing hot, just spice.  I can see why it was a signature dish.  The price was a little higher than I normally spend, but the experience, food, and staff made it a highlight of my trip.  Thank You!",

It was everything!! I had the chicken dinner and my husband had a steak that he says is the best steak he's ever eaten...ever. We also had the corn side dish and the risotto and both were absolutely delicious.We topped it off with the chocolate cake that I cannot even describe in words. Just gooey chocolate Goodness.

Definitely recommended, the sauce is very delicious and makes the shrimp taste even better. But the corn/maize that is leftover at the end is a bit weird.  I ordered the filet mignon medium rare and mash potatoes on the side. Had them to have everything come out quick because I was kind of in a time crunch. I was assured by the server it will be okay. Thankfully he was right.  The steak came out in a reasonable time and was medium rare like I ordered it. It was definitely delicious, but not sure if it can justify $50 USD. It should at least come with a side or two at that price. The mash potatoes were an extra $10 USD and there really wasn't anything special about it. The mash potatoes were average at best.   Overall the food was great, but it is definitely on the pricier end for me. But it is Vegas after all. Food speed and service was reasonable. I would recommend it to others, but hard to say with so many other options if I would come back.",

The halibut and appetizers were my favorites and I would definitely go and order those again.  We also ordered 3 desserts, which were totally worth it!  Sweet potato pudding (and I don't even like sweet potatoes!), Banana pie tart thingy, and spicy peanut chocolate cake.  mmmmmm would definitely go there for dessert and the appetizers!!!

I had two of the appetizers as my main course: the goat cheese queso fundido with rajas, serrano vinaigrette served with blue corn chips and the smoked chicken poblano and black bean quesadilla.   Both were delicious, but very rich. The quesadilla was crispy, which I didn't expect. It was still really good, but not your typical quesadilla - just a heads up.   This is definitely an experience that you pay for the name, but the food matches up. The wine was good - nothing extraordinary, but i'm glad we ordered it.   It was a couple of hundred for myself and two friends with two entrees, two appetizers and a bottle of wine. Not terrible for vegas at all!  Definitely check it out, but I'd recommend ordering more of an entree for dinner. My bad, not theirs.",

Also the French fries that came with the burger were awesome! Perfectly fried and crispy... I'm forgetting about the queso Fundido! It has goat cheese so it deterred the table a bit but I read it was a must so we did and it was Super delicious! To drink everyone has a cactus pear margarita which was my favorite from last time and I had a cactus pear tea...

I grill and smoke a lot of things and I can beat this tenderloin on even a bad day with an internet marinade recipe from Ina Garten, all day long.  I don't know if it's just too much smoke or what, but a pork tendorloin should really not just taste like ham in my opinion, and that is what it tasted like.  Ham.  It was 37 dollars for a few chunks of ham.  Everything else is awesome.  You order a meal like: Shrimp tamale app Any entree except the ham (last one I had was the ribeye) Corn side Cilantro tater side  And it's amazing.  Very good, not crazy overpriced, you just can't beat it for value.  And I don't even like Bobby.  I kinda wanna hate him,",

    "text": "I had the lamb chops in a balsamic Serrano chili reduction sauce. The chose I ordered medium rare. The plate was saturated in this sauce which was incredibly over powering, too vinegary and really needed to reduce longer or use a better quality balsamic. I had this taste in my mouth for days. It was edible but I don't feel was executed properly and for the cost I would expect that. When i told the waiter he said it's not for everyone. I explained that the issue was the vinegar was over powering and if it was properly done it should be more sweet than vinegar. The lamb chops were a little over done cooked medium well-ish and were and effort to cut. The tamale served with it was underwhelming at best.   My friend had the ciopinno, and it was phenomenal.. I was very  very jealous of his dish and he was lovely to share with me. The flavor of the broth was sensational, I could drink the broth. The seafood was quality.  We had the hibiscus margaritas, which I loved!   The bread served at the beginning was interesting. Some I liked more than others. the jalapeno corn bread I felt just had a weird flavor, and the taste of baking soda was intense. My husband didn't seem to notice.   The ambiance definitely leaves something to be desires. I feel more as if i am in some high ceiling-ed cafeteria with table cloths. It's not romantic or special, more of a cattle call. I think the design could have lent a little more to the intimacy and experience of enjoying the food. Again, for the price I have had better for less.   Based on my experience and for the cost this place, I would say I expected more.  The Ciopinno is what saved my experience. I might try this place again if I was with a group or person who insisted on going but would not get the lamb, and most likely wouldn't seek it out again.",

The food is awesome, very tasty with just the right seasoning. I'm not sure how the restaurant was rated with 3 dollar signs, because for two people, the price was $170.00 which I thought was very expensive.   I would recommend the restaurant, but if your looking for a quiet romantic spot this would not be a good choice.",

The food is good. For those of you who are afraid of spicy things - do not fear the jalapenos in the sauces and bread here! Yes, there are peppers, but this is only \"white man spicy\" - not actually hot. Yes, everything is very mild, but still flavorful!  Try the lobster tacos for your appetizer. So yummy! My only complaint was that they should serve 4 instead of 3. Four: no more no less. 5 is right out! (any Monty Python fans here? no?)   The halibut and accompanying corn salsa was delicious. Again, very mild though.  Great ambiance. If you're looking for a nice meal and great service, I highly recommend the Mesa Grill.",

The night before, we had excellent Bone-in Rib Eye Steak at Joe's Seafood Prime Steak (Las Vegas), and couldn't wait to see how Mesa Grill would stack up.  The decor was very nice and modern inside the Caesar's Palace, with staff just lined up and ready to serve.  Our waiter highly recommended the following signature items:  Partida Margarita Pork Tenderloin Tiger Shrimp Tamales Blue Corn Duck  The first two were supposedly Bobby Flay's most famous dishes, and they all tasted good. Sure, the dishes we tried were quite good and surprisingly filling, but for the same price, the five of us agreed that Joe's Seafood Prime Steak was the restaurant we'd rather pick.  However, if you prefer a restaurant with views of good-looking people, Mesa Grill had better \"views.\"",

Would have loved to have had a little more salt to cut the sweetness.

They are a little smaller than I expected, especially for the cost, but tasted amazing. A bread basket was brought to the table that held an assortment of different types of breads. The server was attentive and open to give suggestions. Brian went with the cornmeal crusted chile relleno made with roasted eggplant, manchego cheese sweet red pepper sauce, and balsamic vinegar.  The server stated that it was one of the smaller meals on the menu, but it wasn't really that small at all. It was quite a bit of food. Brian said that it tasted phenomenal and was extremely happy with his choice. I picked the mahi mahi served over creamy green chile rice, yellow pepper mole, cilantro and green chile vinaigrette. This was honestly the best mahi I have ever had in my entire life.  It was amazing. Everything about the dish was perfect. I don't think I could have gone with a better choice. I would highly recommend this restaurant for an excellent lunch or dinner. This will be a place I will frequent going forward in Vegas. Thanks for having such a fantastic restaurant, Bobby Flay!!",

    "text": "After hearing friends rave about this place, I had very high expectations.  I love southwest flavors, so I was really looking forward to trying out Mesa Grill for myself.  I'd also heard good things about their margaritas.  The restaurants sits right up against the casino floor in Caesar's.  The atmosphere inside was okay, but I still felt very aware that I was in a casino.  The bread was really delicious - in particular I was a big fan of the spicy southwest cornbread.  The service was also good - our water glasses didn't remain empty for long.  The margarita list was shorter than I expected.  There were only a few specialty margaritas listed.  I asked the server if they could make any spicy margaritas, and she said she'd bring out some chopped serranos that I could put in a standard margarita.  It was tasty, and I appreciated her accommodating my request, but I was a bit disappointed they couldn't do something a little fancier than giving me a side of peppers to spice up my margarita given that margaritas are supposedly one of their specialties.  I started off with the black bean soup, and boyfriend had the lobster tacos.  He was a huge fan of his tacos, and I'd give my soup a thumbs-up (though I think it may be hard to really mess up black bean soup).   For our mains, he had the swordfish, and I had the scallops.  This is where we were kind of disappointed.  While the accompanying sauces were delicious (mine came with some wild mushroom grits that were awesome), the scallops and swordfish were both overcooked.  They ended up being kind of tough and rubbery.  Kind of a shame because if they had been properly cooked I think we would've had a 4 star experience.  But, given that both of our entrees were overcooked, and we didn't arrive at a busy time, I have to demote to 3 stars.",

    "text": "They messed up our entree twice, and the second time we suspected it wasn't even cooked through. Both entrees were barely edible. Was debating giving 2 stars because they threw out the bill after the second mess-up, the drinks were strong and the appetizer (blue corn pancake with duck) was tasty. Still, there's no excuse for a dinner that would be in the $100 range to be completely inedible. Was the first time in my life a restaurant failed so badly they threw out the bill.  We went last week and started with a Partida Margarita and prickly pear one. Both drinks were pretty good, very strong. Definitely didn't taste like typical mix. Pear one was a very pretty purple and came in a decent-sized glass, the Partida came in a thinner margarita glass.  They switched waiters on us like four times throughout the dinner, which was fine because it meant the service was always prompt.  The blue corn pancake with duck was delicious, but they do stress how small it is. Imagine a thin, crispy crepe about the size of your palm, filled with shredded duck meat. Still, it had a rich but not overwhelming sauce, and was cooked to be tender and flaky. Very well prepared.  For an entree, I ordered the mango chicken with some pesto mashed potatoes, and my girlfriend ordered a tuna steak done medium-well with, I believe, a risotto.   For the tuna steak, it was a hearty chunk on top of the risotto. The risotto was rather tasty. The steak, however, was overcooked and completely dry and gray inside. We called the waiter and he immediately agreed it was way overcooked from a glance. He took it back for us, saying he would ask them to cook it Medium instead of Medium-well, in hopes that maybe it would be just right.  The chicken came served with the potatoes and two good-sized chicken breasts, it actually looked really good, and the couple next to us commented on it. It was completely dry, though. I couldn't really taste the sauce. It was blackened, and tasted very much so. The \"mango\" sauce was mostly sticky-sweet sauce with a tiny dash of spice. It could as well have been store-bought stir fry sauce. Between the two of us, we ate half of one breast while we waited for her dish to come out, and by then I was growing kind of unhappy as I realized we just ate the juiciest part and it was only getting drier the further we went, and the taste of the charred bits was becoming the most overpowering flavor.  I gave the potatoes a shot, but they were very boring and pretty uncomplimentary to the chicken.I munched on them while we waited for her steak to finish. The potatoes themselves were plain, and the pesto drizzled in was... essentially just olive oil with some basil in it. The sauce was very runny, didn't taste like nutty, and I couldn't see any grains to it. Overall, it tasted like mashed potatoes with oil-drenched basil in it.  Her steak came back and it was now undercooked. It was so wet and blubbery she struggled to cut through it, and it kept sliding around on the plate. ANOTHER waiter (not our own) actually walked by as she was cutting it open, and made a face at it, asking if we would like it to be cooked a bit more before we even asked. Meaning it was probably not even cooked through.   She gave him the plate but at that point we were so disgusted we just asked our waiter to bring our check. I rejected a box, and he inquired why, so I explained that I didn't like my dish.  A moment later, JP, the manager walked by and apologized to us, letting us know there wouldn't be a bill. He asked for any comments, and we explained to him that both the appetizers and drinks were delicious, but the entrees were inedible. He offered us free drinks \"to go\" but we declined them.  Left very upset.",

But the little cheese bread was awesome! We've asked for more.  Our burger and fries was cooked perfectly and the smoked salmon was also excellent.

    "text": "I've been a fan of Bobby Flay's for years, and I finally had the chance to try one of his restaurants, so it was a must for my trip to Las Vegas.  My husband and I have a 5 year old girl, very well behaved, and we called ahead to make sure they accommodate kids.  They do, but they have a very limited kids' menu:  cheeseburger, monterey jack quesadilla, or grill chicken with mashed potatoes.  None of which is on an actual menu we were given (the lack of menu disappointed my daughter quite a bit as she likes to look to make her selection).  We were just told about it by our waiter.  My husband and I ordered the goat cheese fundido starter (delicious), and our waiter even thought to leave the peppers on the side in case our daughter wanted to try some as it could make it too spicy.  She did try it, and loved it.  She also tried the sourdough bread, which has hidden pieces of jalapeno in it, which burned her mouth.  She recovered quickly but was not going near the bread again (there was also cornbread and a sweeter bread with raisins).  A heads up about the jalapenos from the waiter would have been nice though.  My daughter ordered the kid's quesadilla, and I appreciated how conscious the staff was of her safety when it arrived.  We were warned that the plate was hot, so they set it in front of me instead.  Then they actually asked if I wanted them to take it back to be put on a cooler plate.  Very thoughtful, but I told them we could just transfer slices to a bread plate.  Worked well, and my daughter enjoyed her quesadilla very well.  My husband had the 16 spice chicken, which he loved, but I didn't care for, as each bite overwhelmed my pallet at the end with cinnamon.  The mashed potatoes it came with were the best I ever had though.  I had the veal chop with sweet potato tamale.  Both were delicious and cooked perfectly.  My daughter ate about a third of my veal chop (apparently, they should put that on the kids menu, go figure....)  We also tried the cauliflower gratin side dish, which was good, I guess, but the southwest flavors seemed a bit overwhelming on cauliflower.  We all shared the passion fruit cheese cake for dessert.  It was the lightest and creamiest cheesecake I've ever had.  In all, the service was excellent.  The food was all very good, though admittedly some not to my taste (my fault for ordering it, not theirs for making it, as none of the food was made poorly).  And while this is very much not a family restaurant that caters to kids, the staff did very well in accommodating my daughter and making she sure she enjoyed her meal as much as we did.",

When I arrived there was a 45 minute wait, but the hostess welcomed me to sit at the bar where the full menu is available.   The bartender was very accommodating and made several menu suggestions.  I started with the tiger corn and rock shrimp roasted corn and garlic tamale.  It was delicious.   There was a delicious cream sauce that really complimented the sweetness of the masa.  It was really delicious.  For my entree, I had the chile relleno stuffed with goat cheese and zucchini with a pea and green chili sauce.  It, too, was amazing.  Really fantastic.  The pepper was crunchy on the outside, but warm and creamy and a little tangy on the inside.  The sauce had a little heat, but more than anything was smooth and added a great flavor that complimented the chile.  It was fantastic as well.    I was really impressed with my meal at Mesa.  I'm looking forward to returning and experiencing table service.",

Sorry, I don't remember everything we had, but definitely get the corn as a side!   I've eaten at Flay's restaurants in NYC and this one surpasses those (easily!)...best meal in Vegas!",

Pork tenderloin was exceptional and an exact copy of the original version from NYC menu.   BBQ duck in a blue corn pancake - another success.     Lunch?  Cornmeal crusted chile relleno had so much cheese that it tasted nothing like the version we know for years.   Different kitchen crew during lunch?   Probably.   Why wouldn't the chef know that the key to executing this dish is the balance between roasted eggplant and manchego cheese?   Too much cheese - and our version was loaded with cheese  ... and the dish is done.  Not even one star.    Biggest disappointment was not even the poorly executed dish.   The server did not even ask us whether we wanted to give the kitchen another chance and make it again.  We did meet the new general manager.  He is a great guy.   Hopefully, the consistency may improve with his arrival.",

App's were fine and I had a Lamb cobb salad for my main. it was very, very dull- lamb was over cooked and poorly spiced (should have known it was a mistake when the waiter didn't ask how I wanted it cooked).  I probably won't return to Mesa Grill- there are many great restaurants on the strip that have great meals, why waste your time at this yawner?",

My 2 year old daughter \"fell in love\" with our waiter John immediately when he offered her some fruit.    We ordered a variety of appetizers and a couple entrees to share:  Blue Corn Pancake Smoke Chicken Quesadilla  Spicy Tuna & Salmon Tartare Tiger Shrimp Tamale Spicy Beef Tartare Pork Tenderloin Sandwich Smoke Shrimp Taco Blue Corn Crusted Halibut   We loved that our server John has given us suggestion on portion and based on the variety and the number of people in our party.    I couldn't decide which one was my favorite, the duck in the Blue Corn Pancake, or the Shrimp Tamale.  Definitely, Mesa Grill has offered Quality instead of Quantity.",

I ordered the chicken mole which had wonderful chicken but the mole was on the sweeter vs. spicy side. I like the combo of sweet and spicy but this was too sweet and I have a major sweet tooth. The best thing ever was the corn. It was grilled and mixed with lime, creme fraiche, cilantro, some other cheese and I wish I ordered a bucket of it.   The relleno was good but had a corn crust that wasn't  exciting. I heard the Halibut was perfect, gone before I could sample. Next time...  I almost forgot the apps.

I unfortunately moved from NYC before going to his places and he just does not have that many on the west coast, so I can't really compare them.  This place is amazing.  The waiter was quick and attentive (being that we were there for lunch during the week and the restaurant was maybe 20% full, this is expected) and also knew everything about every dish.  I also had probably the best Margarita of my life (on the rocks of course) as my aperitif and the waiter was even able to tell me exactly how it was made without asking the bartender (I could not reproduce this at home, although I have come close).  The food was perfect and for the quality was very reasonably priced.  I would recommend to anyone going to Vegas to give this place a try.  I would suggest reservations for dinner or on the weekend, otherwise, just walk on in.  For my money, this place is the best South-Western style cuisine restaurant at which I have ever eaten.",

It was perfect, just perfect.  I can;t really put it into words how perfect but just understand it was devine.  For entree my girl had the duck and she said it was great.  I had the \"bone-in\" rib eye with the chile sauce and it was hands down the best steak I've ever had.   the sauce was not over poweringly spicey like I expected from Flay.  Just very good flavor that added to the steak without overpowering it.  I've had real Japanease kobe served at other celebrety chef restaurants (Gordon Ramsey London, West Hollywood) and I'd prefer the steak at Mesa every time.  The atmosphere wasn't my favorite.  You could see the casino sports room through the glass and it was a little loud.  The tables were close together and it was nearly impossible not to chat with the people sitting at the table beside you.  That was a little irritating but not so much that this is not one of the top five best restaurants I've ever been too.  I can't imagine why anyone would complain about this place's food. It is some of the best ever and worth every penny. The portion sizes are huge also!",

On our first visit, we were totally annoyed with the waiter who apparently did not want to accept the fact that my husband and I did not want cocktails with our lunch.  He repeatedly asked us about drinks and we repeatedly said, \"No, thank you.\"  We ordered an array of appetizers for lunch which were all quite good.  When they arrived, again he brought up the subject of drinks and suggested a special margarita and said we could split it if we wanted to.  Split a drink?  Seriously?  We were not being cheap (just the array of appetizers built a pretty hefty tab) and are totally aware that when in Vegas you shell out the bucks for what you want and we have no problem with that.  We tried Mesa again on a visit last October and were relieved that this time we didn't get the cocktail hard-sell.  We both ordered the barbecued lamb cobb salad.  Our waiter felt the need to mention that the lamb wasn't really barbecued but more on the grilled side.  So, why not call it the grilled lamb cobb salad?  Not a deal breaker.  The salad was tasty although a bit mushy due to the guacamole in it.  Why not just slice or dice the avocado and keep the salad a nice consistency?  Can't say I just can't wait to get back to Vegas to go to Mesa Grill again.  We do say this about meals we have had at Todd English and Wofgang Puck where you get great quality and bang for your big bucks (after all, this IS Vegas). What I can say about this last experience is, \"Bobby, please bring me the rest of my salad!\"  The portion was incredibly small (about a cup full) to have been served in such a large bowl.  The large container only served to make us wonder where the rest of our salad was.  This item needs to be moved to the appetizer section.  If lamb is all that expensive, would it have hurt to at least throw in some extra greens to bulk it up a bit?   The good thing is that all during the rest of our trip, we kept laughing about this salad experience.  Bobby, we still love you but we don't love Mesa Grill!",

Our service was spotty, while the waiter was friendly and offered some good recommendations the table next to us that arrived after us received dessert when we got our main course (both tables were ordering similar items off of the RW menu).  I ordered the scallops for appetizer and they were cooked to perfection my boyfriend got the venison chili and it was very good though not something we would order again. For main course I went with the pork tenderloin and it did not disappoint, so moist and the sauce had the perfect amount of kick; boyfriend went with the spare ribs which were moist and a good sauce to accompany. Dessert was a bit lacking in my opinion; the caramel/chocolate pudding was fine but really just your average pudding. The coconut cake was very good, moist with a nice crunch from the toasted coconut, I don't traditionally like coconut but I thought it was good. All in all I would visit again, though I might not seek it out since it is pricey.",

Lastly, we ordered the rib eye expecting it to taste every bit of the $50 we were paying for it.  It was a disappointment.  The first 6 chunks I cut off were uneatable fat.  Now, I have NEVER sent food back in my entire life.  I just couldn't justify what were were spending with what I was getting.  I mentioned it to our server and he couldn't have been more gracious and went above and beyond to make up for it.  I honestly felt like it was handled very very well.  Great job Mesa. Thanks for the well trained staff and delectable foods.",

The few recipes of his I've made have come out great,  the same cannot be said of other food tv chefs... I'm looking at you Giada!      We've been to Mesa Grill twice, the first time we were simply floored by the flavors.  The lamb tenderloin salad was great, the shrimp tamale was amazing and the shrimp perfectly cooked.  The duck pancake had a smoky flavor and that combination of sweet and savory.  On our most trip, we again enjoyed the tamale.  We also had the tomato soup which was really good and lots of flavor from the fresh tomaotes and cilantro.   I had the chicken quesadilla, which was a boring but still delicious choice.  My wife ordered the buffalo burger, it was relatively lean, but still juicy and had a great natural flavor.   I can't wait to try bar American in NYC.",

    "text": "Bobby Flay's recipes are flat out delicious, but I'm not sure if the price is worth what you get. The lounge atmosphere was nice (especially after a long day of travel!).  First off, I am less than happy about the reservations setup there. My party had reservations for 10 for 12:30 and arrived about 15 minutes early ... but weren't seated until 15 minutes past our reservations. Given they had known we were coming for nearly a month, and we'd confirmed the reservations earlier that day, they should have made sure everything was ready. The delay *wasn't* because the tables were all full, incidentally - where we sat was empty and clean and waiting for us when we arrived. I'm also less than happy about the upsell for bottled water - they didn't offer ice water when we seated (just bottled water - sparkling or flat) and implied tap water was not available.  My party ended up ordering the Goat Cheese (\"Queso Fundido\") with rajas and tortilla strips as an appitizer, and getting baskets of bread with a ciobatta, some sort of wheat bread with cranberries in it, and a chile cornbread. The Queso Fundido which was creamy and a little spicy and very delicious, and I could have happily eaten an entire order by myself. It wasn't as spicy as I had expected it to be, but that's ok, it was perfect with the goat cheese. The ciabatta and the wheat bread were great (I did eat almost the entire basket of that). I liked the chile cornbread, but thought it was really weak in the spice department and it was cold in the middle, like they had baked a bunch and froze them and just reheated it for lunch and got it in long enough that it was all thawed and the outsides were warmish, but the middle was still ice cold.  For entrees, many people ordered the Mesa Burger (double cheddar, grilled vidalia onion, and horseradish mustard on a house roll with southwest fries). One person ordered the Pressed Cuban Burger (which was a burger with ham, swiss cheese, pickles, dijon mustard, and roasted garlic mayo with adobo fries). I ordered the Grilled Mahi Mahi, which came with a roasted pineapple-cascabel chile sauce and a pineapple-green onion salsa. One person ordered the Yucatan Chicken Tacos (with grilled red onion and a peanut smoked chile BBQ sauce), and the person next to me ordered the New Mexico-style Pork Tenderloin Sandwich (with grilled red onion, arugula, ancho-chile mayo, and southwest fries).  I quite enjoyed the Mahi Mahi. The pineapple-chile sauce was spicy enough to give a nice kick to the fish, and the pineapple-onion salsa gave a balancing sweetness. I ended up using some bread to mop up the last of the chile sauce because it was that good (and I was that hungry!). Everyone else seemed to quite enjoy their lunches as well.  Price-wise, there was some grumbling at the end that it was a little expensive for what you get. In my opinion, it cost a little more than I thought it was worth, but not so much that I would never return. The service was good (the reservation and water upselling issues aside), the food was excellent.",

The answer is \"yes.\"  Mesa Grill adds little touches to their food that finishes the dish.  Ice tea with simple lemon syrup, the haberno/ star anise sauce on Blue Corn Pancakes, Jalapenos on some awesome corn bread.  The only complaint is my duck was way over cooked for the Blue Corn Pancake.  Otherwise, service was incredible and food was good.  We will definitely be back to Mesa.",

Overall, I thought it lived up to much of the reputation that preceeded it.    The menu is diverse, and sounds delicious.  I really liked that the lunch menu had both lighter fare and hearty entrees.  The food itself was good.  Maybe not a home run, but certainly good.  In particular, the cheese fundido appetizer was quite simple, yet tasty.  My 16 spice chicken salad was good, but am not sure that it was way ahead of other good lunch salads I've had.  Service was a bit rough at first, but got better as lunch went on.  Overall, I was pleased with the experience.  Too bad Yelp doesn't have a 1/2 star system.  It really deserves 3 1/2 stars, but I'm rounding up if for no other reason than it offered a nice respite from the sound of all the slot machines and cigarette smoke on the casino floor!",

    "text": "Went here last night with the BF because we are huge Bobby Flay fans as heard from family that this place was good.  Our experience unfolded with mixed feelings...  FOOD: I ordered from the special restaurant week menu they had going on, three courses for just over 50 bucks which is a great deal.  The salad I chose for course  number one was top notch!  Not too hefty on the lettuce, crunchy white and blue corn chip pieces, perfect amount and type of cheese, and great dressing.  Then I had the ever-raved-about pork tenderloin.  Perfectly cooked, good balance of flavor, but insanely spicy.  I'm a southern gal, I like spice, but wow...  This one should have a warning on it. The tamale that comes with does an ok job of balancing the heat, and is absolutely delicious by itself, but I was glad I had plenty of water and a yummy white peach margarita to wash it all down.  Third course was a chocolate pudding with salted caramel something or other.  It was tasty; I also could have easily made it at home.   BF had the rib eye.  It looked good.  Flavor was great.  Unfortunately, the cook was way off.  He asked for mid rare, and got super duper rare.  It bordered on undercooked.  BF got a side of corn which, I didn't care for but, he loved which is surprising because he hates cheese.  So... Mixed thoughts on food  SERVICE/AMBIANCE: Amazing!!  Perfect balance of casual atmosphere and fine dining.  The entire front of house staff is spectacular.  Kind, professional, caring, and timely without being stuffy or overly doting.  We tipped big because we found everyone deserving - from the hostess to our waiter to the guy with the water.  So all in all, a pretty fine choice.",

As much as it pains me to admit it, this place is on point.  Decor is cool, drinks were awesome, prices were actually pretty reasonable considering the location.   And that lamb.  Man, the lamb porterhouse I had was completely out of this world. I don't know if the kitchen was just really \"on\" that night, but I've taken drugs that were less euphoric than the experience of consuming this lamb.   Out waiter was clever, knew the menu, the food, the philosophy, had a \"I've been doing this for a while but still totally love it\" vibe about him and generally added that last star to put us over the hump.   There's a lot of big name restaurants vying for your company credit card in Vegas. There's either another (former) Iron Chef (don't get me started on the former part) with a big money place also begging for that coin. I would consider it a mistake to not stop at Mesa during a trip out here. Not a tragedy, but something that you will regret.",

    "text": "I have dined at MESA in Caesar's Palace three times and always try to make it there every time I'm in Vegas.   Reservations: You definitely should try to call ahead for dinner reservations, as we are all aware that Flay's a genious and thus walking in to his restaurant is virtually impossible during the dinner hour, especially on a weekend. Note: a credit card is required to hold a reservation, and if you miss your time slot, they *will* charge it.   Appetizers I've had: GOAT CHEESE \"QUESO FUNDIDO\" - sinful and delicious. Warm goat cheese dip accompanied by a carb of sorts. SMOKED CHICKEN + BLACK BEAN QUESADILLA - like Taco Bell on steroids. Bursting with flavor, sets the tone for what is bound to be an incredible dining experience. TIGER SHRIMP+ ROASTED GARLIC CORN TAMALE - delicious, but some entrees are served with a tamale, so make sure you don't overload yourself on this app/side.  Entrees I've had: NEW MEXICAN SPICE RUBBED PORK TENDERLOIN - served with a sweet potatoe tamale. It was great, but with each bite of pork, I wished I was eating a steak.  BLACK ANGUS NEW YORK STRIP STEAK - that's the goodness right there. It's nothing like a steakhouse flavor-wise; quality-wise, sure. But this is a steak prepared in a way you've never experienced, totally mindblowing flavor palette. Order medium rare for the optimal texture.  Sides I've had: MASHED POTATOES: a must with steak/meat dishes CREAMED CORN: amazing flavor, but not seeing it on their menu online. Hope they didn't get rid of it.  Desserts I've had: CHURROS - traditional cinnamon, warm churro served with hot chocolate dipping sauce. So authentic and fun to eat. It's nice to know they don't just slap \"Chocolate Lava Cake\" on the dessert list like everyone else and call it a day.  Service: It's what you'd expect from a restaurant of its calibur, but it's nothing super noteworthy, unfortunately - but what is in Vegas? The hostesses are Vegas snobs for the most part, sorry to say. And even if you have a reservation, you will likely find your party waiting at least 10 minutes to be sat.   Enjoy!!",

Well...the chopped salad was pretty mediocre, and too filling with all the red kidney beans it it. The table breads and muffins were too dry, kind of inedible.  Duck pancake...like someone had poured half a bottle of cheap, sweet syrup on it so who knows what the duck tasted like.  The porterhouse lamb chops - very good. This was by far the best thing I had. The lamb was perfectly grilled, and the sauce was inoffensive so you could enjoy the meat.   Dessert - that warm, pudding-like cake that I can't remember. It was good, and chocolate. Like many restaurants they served the dessert and then came around asking for coffee as kind of an afterthought. The coffee service took so long that it was tough to wait on eating the cake. Dang, I like coffee WITH dessert. But, most restaurants haven't figured out how to serve both at around the same time.  The restaurant is a nice spot in Caesars so I don't want to dissuade people from going. But, I'd make the grilled meat the centerpiece of what you order and not get too high on hope for the rest, based on what I experienced. And get a nice bottle of wine to go with it!",

    "text": "The Gist: THE best pork tenderloin ever.   Rip-off ceviche sampler.  Arrived late for our reservation on Friday night without a peep from the  hostessess.   At 10:30 PM the place was still booming with patrons, which is a good sign.    We ordered the ceviche sampler, Mexican Rub Pork Tenderloin with sides of roasted tomato and horseradish mashed potato.   This was plenty for a late dinner for two.   Let's not forge the drinks.   Theres an extensive wine selection and the Black Widow Mojito was very yummy.  We love our raw fish but don't consider ourselves snobs about it.   But if we pay $22 for an appetizer, we do expect something pretty good.  Not so here.   Fish quality was so-so.  Maybe it couldn've helped if the dish was chilled a more.  We finished the plate in just a few bites so we felt like we swallowed our money without satisfaction.   Not a good feeling.   The pork tenderloin was on the other end of the spectrum.   It was THE best pork loin I have ever eaten.   So soft and juicy and rubbed with Mexican spices and a hint of sweet potato puree, the pork was a mouthful of savory flavor.      The side roasted tomato was infused with light smokey flavor which was a lovely complement to the pork.   I'm usually not a tomato person, but cooked like this, I think I could eat a couple vines.     Mashed potato is difficult to go wrong, but at Mesa, it is especially savory.  I love how its not like the tradition bacon and cheese topping.    A light horseradish flavor gives it just the right amount of kick which is cooled with a smooth chive-cream fraiche.    Yummy!  I think anyone who likes grilled meat and is looking for something different from the traditional steak should check out Mesa Grill.   Plus, the waitress told us Bobby Flay comes in about once a month.  Maybe you'll be luckier than us and actually see him!",

    "text": "Graduating college is a big deal, and after receiving the gift of my first trip to Las Vegas, I knew there was no higher restaurant destination in the country better than Mesa Grill.  Coming in with expectations and dreams of tasting the best food in America from the best chef to ever grace the planet, I can happily say everything exceeded what I had hoped for.  With a 6:00pm reservation, we were immediately seated along the back window overlooking Bobby Flay's beautiful space.  Our waitress, who had worked in the restaurant since the day they opened, was passionate and insightful about what to drink and what to eat.  Planning ahead that I was likely to enter into a \"Food-coma\" our party of four tried to pace ourselves while also sampling what we hoped were the best dishes the restaurant had to offer.  To begin our meal, we sampled two different margaritas.  One was a original version and one a Cactus Pear version.  Both were delicious and quite strong.  Our waitress started us off with a bread basket filled with blue-corn muffins, jalapeno cheddar roles, and even more types indescribable bread that likely will have you begging for more before your drinks even arrive.  For appetizers, we selected the Tiger Shrimp Tamale, the Spicy Tuna + Salmon Tartares, and Sophie's Chop Salad.  The Tamale was one of the greatest appetizers I have ever eaten and the actual corn tamale stuffing itself was licked dry.  The Tartares were spicy yet packed with flavor and came with plantain chips that were sweet and crispy.  The Salad was OK flavor-wise but had really nice textures and was a big in size.  For our entrees, we each tired something different.  I ordered the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin, which was served with an amazingly flavorful sweet potato tamale.  The pork was perfectly cooked, ultra juicy and was demolished off of the plate rather quickly.  The other three entrees chosen consisted of Blue Corn Crusted Halibut, Sixteen Spice Chicken, and a special of Tempura Soft Shell Crab.  Each dish was completely devoured, along with a side dish of a Chile Relleno, which I wish we had ordered two of.  If given a choice of my second favorite entree (the Pork was first), I would definitely choose the Chicken.  Dessert is always a must when dining with me, so as a table we decided to split three of them.  The Strawberry Shortcake, the Mango-Blackberry Crostada, and the Cookie Sampler.  Once again, everything suddenly was missing, despite our stomachs at capacity level.  The service was phenomenal from beginning to end, and once our waitress found out we were celebrating my graduation, she brought over a small dish of pineapple ice cream with a candle.  If you happen to find yourself in Las Vegas, please do yourself a favor and stop by Mesa Grill.  I promise the food will be some of the best you've ever tasted!",

And this is what spoiled the entire experience for me. We had reservations and somehow got a table which was right behind a server station which was along side of an on-ramp. The waiter would casually lean over the side of the ramp to ask us how we were doing, then leave before we could finish a sentence. There were tons of waitstaff milling about, but very few people actually in the restaurant at the time for dinner. The staff seemed more interested in talking to each other and watching the games on the big TVs that dominated the area (loudly) just outside the restaurant.  I will say that the food was absolutely top notch. I had the strip steak and it was just perfect. Loved the twice baked potato and collard greens as well. Unfortunately, we did not stay for dessert. I couldn't see sticking around and paying top dollar for horrible service.  Perhaps we'll give this a try when we are in New York. I wouldn't recommend this for Vegas. There are much better places to go.",

I personally feel there are more things to Tex-Mex cooking than those two staples.    At any rate, we were a party of three & we all thought the food was great. The menu prices were to be expected, after all we were @ Ceasar's Palace. The service was impecable.  The bread was fabulous, but don't fill up on it. We ordered a shrimp tamale as an appetizer. It was so good, I needed to be home to eat it. The masa was so flavorful that you would want to eat the husk. The only problem was that you get just one @ a cost of about $16., let's not forget it was GREAT!!   I ordered the lobster, it was better than I ever expected. I simply melted in my mouth. I was happy to see that it was a whole lobster & not the tail weighing in @ about 1.5lbs., cooked to perfection. The sides are ordered ala cart & they are large enough to share,.   My cousin's ordered The bone-in steak & the other the salmon. They stated it was very good & I'm sure it was but I know it couldn;t be as good as my lobster.  For dessert, I had the creme brule. Anytime I see it on the menu, I feel it my duty to order. It was also great. beverages were fantastic, top shelf all the way.  If you want a 5 Star meal @ a reasonable price. This is the place",

The atmosphere is cool, a little loud, but overall fun - comfy waiting area up front at the bar, and not too long a wait for a table.  The waitstaff was very attentive and helpful with recommendations.  The breadbasket was fun, with the blue/yellow cornbread and jalapeno bread both of which tasted great.   I considered the green chile burger and the pork tenderloin sandwich, but settled on the Mesa Burger ($16) since it was the signature lunch dish and it was my first time here.  The server asked how much pink I liked in the burger and it came out cooked perfectly.  The horseradish mustard and grilled onions worked well together, and the southwestern fries were solid, soft and somewhat reminiscent (although not as good as) the fries at Five Guys.  I tried my friend's chile relleno and that was nicely prepared as well.  All in all I was not disappointed, and would return for sure.  Would really like to see his burger joint in LA or OC!",

I hate corn but the corn soup was phenomenal.   Additionally Bobby Flay is known for his amazing spice combinations and the multiplicity of flavors you get from one single bite of his food. Even more impressive was the staff's knowledge of each layer of flavor. I tried this chicken tortilla dish that from first bite to last bite I was so impressed I could not wait for the rest of the meal (as it was only the appetizer).  Each element of every dish was carefully seasoned so when you bite in you get an explosion in your mouth that screams of orgasmic pleasure.    Try the lamb or pork chops, try the steak, try any dish I promise you that you will not walk away disappointed and if you did not like anything I think I know a good Bobby Flay restaurant to know that they will replace it for you.",

    "text": "Ok, where do I get started...let's see:   Decor/Staff: I personally loved the modern open space. Lighting was to my satisfaction, color scheme and decorations were exciting. Staff was cordial and had good timing. But it absolutely sucked to be eating such a nice meal with a view of the sports betting area, watching two-bit bookies walk back and forth down the beaten path, swilling a high life. Walls are non tinted glass so everyone strolling through the area is looking at you and vice versa. Don't forget the added benefit of watching the sports betting area. Tacky. Well it is Vegas!   Score: Minus -1 star.   Prices:  One expects to pay premium at celebrity chef's eatery but also expects great food. But even this seemed to have an extra Vegas markup like everything else in Vegas.   Score: Push   Food/Wine:  Ok, I saved the best for last. The meal was good...really damned good! I love spices and after having tried Mesa Grill in Manhattan, I knew I would like the food here. I dined with two of my NASA buddies and we started off with three appetizers and would share:   - Tiger Shrimp + Roasted Tamale: delicious! Was my favorite of the three apps (I loved them all though). But 16 for 3 shrimp? C'mon, man!   - Blue Corn Pancake + BBQ Duck: another wonderful tasting app. Never had BBQ duck and couldn't get enough of it. Really, because it was about the size of coffee cup in diameter.   - Cremini Mushroom Quesadilla: finally an app as big as it's price! Actually this was quite tasty and loved the fried quail egg on top.. Delish!   For my entree I had the Fire Roasted Veal Chop. it was maple glazed and served with a wild rice tamale. Damn, this was good. After using utensils for as long as I could, I went caveman style grabbed to bone and chewed off the last remnants. Yeah, it was that good. I tried a piece of the chipotle glazed bone-in rib eye...ahh hell yeah...I know what my next piece of meat at Mesa Grill will be.   We shared a 2006 (?) bottle of the Shafer Relentless and it was probably the best bottle of wine I 've ordered at a restaurant in a long time. It had a price to match it's taste, as well. I did think the wine list was a little unimpressive though.  Score: 5 starts   It's really annoying and distracting to see the same guy about ten times over the course dinner, obviously placing bets for a number of people in the sports betting area. He literally walked into and out of view so much that we started betting on when he would pass by again. That plus seeing people wheel by with their luggage took away from a very enjoyable meal.",

    "text": "First off, the bread basket was surprisingly good and different from any other. It was southwestern inspired and def set the bar for Mesa. That night we were served blue corn cornbread muffins, asiago cheese bread (somewhat like sourdough, perfect crust & cheesy flavor), and jalepeno cheddar bread (a hint of spice and lots of flavor).  Appetizers Queso Fundido YUM! Made with goat cheese, so it was little on the sharp side, but man oh man-- it was addicting.  Tiger Shrimp + corn tamale It was a meal on its own!! I loved this dish and wanted to steal it from my friend. The shrimp was plump and flavorful, the tamale was slightly sweet and the spicy, creamy sauces were perfect for the dish. I crave this.  16-Spice Chicken The juiciest, flavorful chicken that I have ever ordered at a restaurant. Amazing. I'm usually a steak person, but I had the urge to order something less filling (so I wouldn't feel like a heffer at the club afterwards). The herb mashed potatoes were creamy, not too buttery, which was amazing with the crisp chicken skin. The cilantro sauce was just right- not too strong, and complimented the spices on the skin. I loved this dish and would recommend it.  My friends ordered the ribeye, pork tenderloin, and venison-- I tried a bite of each, but I don't think it's enough to judge the entire dish. They were all tasty though, nothing bad to say. Love this restaurant though and I'm not even a huge Bobby Flay fan. He won me over and I'll be going back to Mesa next time I'm in Vegas.  Side note: The water guy was a ninja!!! He was on top of his game and we were really impressed!! Obviously, partying in Vegas means heavy drinking = dehydration = we needed LOTS of water to recover. This guy got a big tip from us.",

One of my friends was ranting and raving about the rib eye he had at Mesa the night before. He told me I had to try it before I left Vegas. That he would go back two days in a row to order it again. So we went that day for lunch. But to our disappointment the rib eye was not on the lunch menu.  He talked to the manager and was able to convince her to get the chef to make the rib eye. This is one of the best steaks I have had. It is in my top three. What really sets it apart from the rest is the sauce.  The red & green chile sauce is the perfect complement to the rib eye.",

No need to have their nose up in the air with folks in town for a conference. So that was my initial impression. The Host was very crude upon us entering the restaurant with a laptop case & INSISTED, we couldn't take it to the dining room. Which is totally fine, but no need to bite our heads off. Just tell us where to put it!   Our server must have been new or just a chatter box, but it took him about 10+ mins to go through the menu (which isn't very big in the first place) ps. Have a mint!   Food: Corn Soup was darn good (my co-worker ordered that). I had the grilled Asparagus salad which was nice & refreshing.   For my meal i had the tiger shrimp tamale. I gotta say, A+! sooo yummy! the tamale itself was perfectly made, the taste was very light & the fresh corn--YUM!  Ohh the fries - another great treat. Dessert - Coconut cake - HOLY MOLY, light, fresh, not tooo sweet, but just darn good!   Overall food was good...service was lackluster",

    "text": "For my #100 review, it will go to none other than the restaurant owned by my celebrity crush, Bobby Flay! I am a hugeeee fan of Bobby Flay, and food network, Iron Chef in particular.  I have always wanted to try his menu and ever since I found out he had a restaurant in Las Vegas, I been waiting for the next time I went to eat at Mesa Grill.  Well after going to vegas for 4 times and NOT having the chance to eat at Mesa Grill, I finally got to go eat lunch at Mesa Grill this past weekend.  I would have much rather come here for dinner, since it has a wider variety than lunch, but I was still very excited none the less.  Everyone in my group got their own lunch entree, and a few of us shared a couple appetizers.  For appetizers, I got to try the Blue Corn Pancake, Rough Cut Tuna Nachos, and the Spicy Beef Tenderloin Tartare.  Blue Corn Pancake - I LOVED this appetizer! Bobby Flay is known for his chili sauces, and it did not disappoint!  The sauce went soo well with the tender duck and soft pancake.  The only bad thing about this dish was that there was not enough of it!  Rough Cut Tuna Nachos - I love raw appetizers, tuna and salmon dishes especially. The Mango and Habanero hot sauce mixture was very different for me, but still good.   Spicy Beef Tenderloin Tartae - It said it comes with a green onion potato salad but I have no idea where that was.  It was presented with the tenderloin tartare, a few pieces of toast, and shitake mushrooms.  My first time eating raw beef in a tartare form and I really liked it.  It was good by itself, or piled onto the toasted bread and a piece of the shitake mushroom.  While everyone else chose a burger or sandwich, I tried to be different and went along with the Mahi Mahi with roasted pineapple sauce and, caramalized pineapple, and creamy green chili rice.  I'm terribly sorry to say Bobby Flay, but this is probably one of the worst dish I have ever ordered.  The mahi mahi was tasteless and very dry, and it did not go well with the rest of the dish.  I enjoyed eating the little pieces of pineapple and the rice more than the main part of the dish.  My friend had said, \"the one person that wanted to go here the most, ordered the worst\" Minus 1 star for this dish, or else it would've been a 5 star restaurant to me.  However, I was able to try the New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich and the Pressed Cuban Burger, both which was amazingly good, especially the Pressed Cuban Burger.  When I first read it on the menu, I was confused because it didn't mention a burger patty, just smoked ham, and I did not want it.  What a big mistake! The smoked ham along the juicy burger and swiss cheese, pickles, and roasted garlic mayonnaise was to die for! Probably one of the best burgers I have ever had in my life. The New Mexican Spiced Pork sandwich was a little simpler tasting, but still very good. The pork was well seasoned and not try like most pork pieces would be.  Two of my friends ordered from the pri fixe menu that came with a chocolate dessert that we all got to sample.  I'm not sure what it is because it just said \"Chef's Dessert of the Day\" but it reminded me of a chocolate flan with some cookies.  I'm not a big chocolate fan but I really liked this dessert.  It was smooth and creamy and not too sweet.  Besides my disappointment with my own entree, I loved everything else at Mesa Grill. The food took awhile to come out (I think they were waiting for all the dishes to be finished soo it can be served to all of us at the same time) but the service was good and Mesa Grill has a very nice atmosphere.  It is a little pricey, but what do you expect from a famous celebrity chef?  It's well worth it in my opinion.  I only wish to be given the chance to travel all around to dine at other Bobby Flay's Restaurants!",

My wife and I were lucky enough to get to go this year and I practically packed a fork and knife in anticipation.   Mesa Grill was the first restaurant we tried on the trip. I ordered the Tiger Shrimp Tamale for an appetizer and it absolutely hit the spot. The flavor was extremely bold, and I literally used my spoon to scrape the remaining sauce from the plate. Delicious.  For the main course I decided to try the pork tenderloin sandwich and I absolutely loved the combination on the plate. I love to combine my food, and I recommend putting the fries in the sandwich as you eat. By the way, the pork is served cold and medium rare, which the waiter warns you about in advance. For this reason, I don't understand fellow yelpers complaining that the sandwich was not hot, or undercooked.  My only small complaint would be I didn't like the corn bread served before the meal.  After it was all said it done, we ended up going to the Mesa Grill two out of the three days. This is no small fact considering we could eat wherever we wanted. I now find myself having dreams about that pork tenderloin sandwich. Loved that sauce.  Recommended.",

    "text": "My husband took me here for my birthday along with two friends.  It was my first Bobby Flay experience and so I was looking forward to it.  I had little expectations just because it's in a hotel and I didn't know how Tex Mex would be in a casual fine dining atmosphere.    The restaurant's atmosphere is great.  It's bright and welcoming.  This place is busy so definitely make reservations.    We showed up early and we were told that they wouldn't be able to seat us until our reservations (completely fine), so we left and came back about 3 minutes before our reservation.  They were behind a little.  10 minutes pass and the host let us know that she didn't foret about us but tables were turning slow (loved that she acknowledged us) and then after another 5-10 minutes she came up to us and said that the restaurant would be buying us drinks for the wait (okay!) we sat about a half hour after our reservation and they immediately sent us out an appetizer to again apologize.  I was impressed with how they handled it.  I worked as a host for years and was happy to see that these hosts worked the front so well.  After we sat down we were greated by our server and started ordering our food.  Everything came out perfectly from the corn bread to the filet mignon.  The rock shrimp tamale was oh so good!  I am not a Rib Eye fan but the flavor of the cut was so good!  I also had the duck pancake.  I would have eaten those all night.  I would stray from the double baked potato and get the corn if they have it on the menu as a side.  It was like eating candy (not sweet, just you don't want to stop eating it!)   The chef's in the kitchen are trained to perfection.  People it's NOT Bobby Flay cooking your steak and it's not him making your menu!  Give credit where credit is deserved!  A lot of people don't realize it's just his name and face sometimes but his executive chef's and sous chefs do a lot of the grunt work and creativity! The presentations were beautiful as well.  And I can't forget the backwaits.  Our water glasses were never empty, our plates were whisked away silently and we were never bumped into when they were clearing other tables (even though the tables are very close together).  The prices of the food and drinks are expensive but what do you expect?  Other than the quality being top notch you are in Caesars eating at Bobby Flay.  If you don't like a perfectly cooked filet at $44 then go to Denny's.  I think they have a $2.99 special from midnight to 6am.  This was a great meal. I would tell anyone going to vegas to try this place because you will not be disappointed!  I love seeing other foodies enjoy this place as much as I did!",

On our last visit our server went out of her way to make our visit an excellent experience. Thank you Laura you rock!  The food was as good as I remembered it to be. We started by splitting the Tiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale and the Sophie Chopped Salad. Both were incredibly delectable. We then moved on to the Green Chile Cioppino, Alaskan King Crab Cake, Smoked Chicken & Black Bean Quesadilla and Blue Corn Pancake. Now mind you all this food was for two. My husband couldn't decide what to eat so he ordered all of it. The only objection I had was that the Crab Cake was way too spicy. Very close to being inedible. But the rest of our meal was epic. Needless to say it was another memorable evening.   Thank you Bobby Flay and Staff!!!",

    "text": "This must be one of the poorest dining experiences we have ever had in Las Vegas. It's truly shocking that Bobby Flay would allow his name to be associated with this restaurant.  Although the room is attractive enough, and our server was pleasant and competent, that's where the good ends. Cocktails were ok, although mine needed to be replaced because it was incorrect. The food was dreadful, barely edible. Our first courses were served almost immediately (perhaps one minute) after they were ordered...they must have come off a buffet or steam table rather than being prepared/cooked to order (cooked shrimp, tamales, and a salad). One entree (pork) was served cold (actually chilly), and when re-served was dry, tasteless and very poor. The other entree (salmon) was clearly of poor quality containing a considerable amount of the fishes grey flesh which is found under the skin and is usually trimmed away in the kitchen. The fish was otherwise tasteless, and generally not good. We were terribly disappointed and left as soon as we could!",

I got the pork tenderloin and it was fantastic. I was hesitant (because I'm kind of cheap) to spend $38 on a dish with no sides, starters or booze, but it was worth it. I'm taking my wife here when we go to Vegas later this summer.  The other guys raved about their food (and we eat at a lot of nice places) and said it was some of the best food they've had. There was tuna, pork, and steak...all of it was great.",

    "text": "Have you ever seen that episode of South Park where Randy becomes obsessed with the Food Network? That's me. Naturally, I jumped at the opportunity to eat at Mesa Grill when I recently traveled to Las Vegas. I felt as though by eating at Bobby Flay's restaurant so much of his cooking talent would rub off on me that I would instantly become the next Iron Chef.  The meal starts off with a basket of bread: a southwestern corn muffin, cheddar jalapeno bread, and cranberry walnut bread. ALL AMAZING. While the muffin fell apart pretty easily, the incredible flavor of the sweet corn with the chiles baked into the bread was unbelievably satisfying. The walnut bread was by far the best, however.  I started my meal with the Goat Cheese Queso Fundido. Forget EVERYTHING YOU EVER THOUGHT YOU KNEW ABOUT QUESO. I feel like after tasting this, no queso will ever quite satisfy me again. The queso is served in a mini cast-iron casserole dish (which I am determined to find and buy and cook with all the time), bubbling and gooey and cheesy and just all-around wonderful. It's topped with red peppers, and green peppers, and onions (my three favorite veggies) and served with blue corn tortilla chip strips. Unbelievable.  For my main course, I got the Yucatan Chicken Tacos. The ONLY downside to my meal was that I only got three tacos, and I could have easily eaten six. Not only are they tiny, but they are incredibly delicious. The chicken is perfectly seasoned and then grilled (of course, it's Bobby Flay!). Instead of the normal taco-style lettuce, the tacos are served with cilantro and mint. Grilled red onions are also served on the side, and three flour tortillas, which tasted just like what I assume my Mexican grandmother's tortillas would taste like (if I had a Mexican grandmother...). Top it all off with a little of the chile-peanut BBQ sauce, and you've got the best chicken tacos I've ever had. It's a do-it-yourself dish that requires you to build the tacos yourself, but that madeit even more awesome, because then I felt like I was cooking with Bobby Flay (don't judge me...).  I did not have the dessert, because I ran out of money :( I could only assume that had I tried the dessert, I would have never wanted to leave.  Bobby Flay, you are a GOD.",

Excellent Pork (fairly spicy), very delicious cauliflower still not sure exactly what the creation was but a big plate of it any day of the week would make me smile. The lamb looked great, the chicken tacos were so-so, the signature tamale was not that impressive, but the wine selection was excellent. French fries were pretty good -- seasoned with paprika, salt, and cilantro. The dessert was by far my favorite! Apple pie & the Pear with tequila sorbet *mmm.*  Date Rating: 7 Pick up Scale: 3 (7 on a good night at the bar... you will probably wait for your table)  Strong suggestions: Call ahead for a table.",

The queso was bland but the pancakes were actually pretty good. We also shared a margarita but it was not made well and did not taste like fresh lime but triple sec and sweet and sour. Our entrees were pretty good. I had the chile relleno and my boyfriend had the pork. Overall, our experience wasn't awful but just wish he food had more flavor.",

If you don't cancel or make any last minute changes 1 hour prior to your meal, they'll charge you $50/person. Makes sense, but still.  3. Mehhhhhhh to their specialty cocktails. Simply put, it's not their thing!  Conclusion: Skip the entree. Just get 2 appetizers instead. They're the real stars!",

I don't usually order margaritas, but I decided to order one here because it sounded good - and I must say - it was amazing! Best margarita I've ever had.   For the food, we went with the servers recommendations. We ordered a few of the tiger shrimp tamales, and the blue corn pancake. Aside from the margarita, the appetizers were the highlight of the meal. Amazing.  For the main course, we all decided to go with their specialty and ordered the pork tenderloin. It was actually a lot of food and was cooked perfectly. It had a bit of kick to it, so if you don't like spicy food, then this wouldn't be the dish for you.   The service was also great. My only complaint would be the timing of the meal. We got our drinks and appetizers super fast and then we seriously waited another 25 minutes to receive our main course. But other than that, this place is worth trying.",

First off, I, the giddy school girl inside, came right out and asked if Mr Flay was there (obviously knowing there was a 99.9% chance he wasn't), and he wasn't. And the host came right out and asked me \"Why, he is so full of himself, such a dick\"  Yikes, someone got yelled at, or saw something that the TV doesn't show. If your staff is talking like that, then that's a problem.  So we sit, and I don't see anything I really want to eat. We get apps. The waiter, glared at us, ignored us, probably because we weren't middle age upper white class. We are in our 20s, tattooed and middle class... sue me! So he finally comes over with these cheddar biscuits- they were pretty good.  We get the duck tamales, or something like that... lets just say it went right through us, and we were sick for the last 2 days on our trip.  So Bobby Flay Your staff called you a dick Your staff is just as pretentious as you Your food wasn't good, and possibly gave us food poisoning. And I met you a year later at a book signing, and it all came together, you are just a fantasy, a seemingly nice guy on TV- but I think you're host in Vegas said it best....  Will never go back.",

Now my feelings have changed. With there recent Michelin Star lose, I see no future regain of that star unless things greatly approve.   I was seated within 5 minutes of arrival for my lunch in which they seemed to have a pretty packed house. Now when I go to a restaurant I expect to have my bread basket within 5-10 minutes once seated. I was seated for about 10 minutes when I placed my order and 5 minutes later they brought the bread. But enough about that. Of course the oh soooooooooooo good corn bread muffin was in there which is still to this day my favorite corn bread I've had and being southern I get around :)! It was tempting for me to order my favorite dish, Tiger Shrimp Tamale, but I wanted to try something new. I went with the Yucatan Chicken Tacos with grilled Onions and Peanut-Smoked Chile Barbeque sauce. Once they arrived I was kinda put off that you basically have to make the tacos yourself. Now I'm far from lazy but when I go somewhere to eat I don't want to have to put together my own food because well, I'm there to relax and put my trust in the Chefs. But aside from that the flavors were very bold and went together perfect. The Peanut-Smoked Chile Barbeque sauce had a very nice smokey taste with a good kick which is EXACTLY the kinda flavor I like. The chicken was very fatty which I wouldn't expect from a EX Michelin star restaurant but I guess thats where the EX comes into play. Overall the dish was good but I have had MUCH better from my local mexican restaurant down the street which is pretty sad.  Overall this lunch was nothing like my first. The service was very decent besides the bread arrival. While I was left excited and couldn't wait to get back the first time, this time around I find myself only going back if someone else was paying.",

From the food to the wine selection to the service everything was simply spectacular. I will say we ran our bill up pretty high, but that was completely due  to our wine selections.  (I thought the entree prices were quite reasonable.) Our sommelier (Heidi) was incredibly helpful and friendly in her recommendations. I had the Black Angus Strip steak. It was cooked medium-rare (as I requested) and it was delicious. The house made steak sauce was very good as well, but to be honest I liked the rub on the steak so much I did not use much of the sauce. I strongly recommend the Tiger Shrimp Tamale appetizer as well as Blue Corn Pancake Barbecued Duck.  One note, if you are looking for a quiet place, this probably is not the spot. I know our group was on the louder side so we had no issues with the ambiance at all. It is a vibrant happening spot with a great energy. If quiet and romantic is more your style than you may want to find another place.",

The goat cheese fondido was SOOOOOO DELISH!!!  The tamales were DA BOMB! Garlic one was good. I had the sweet potato one that was very good however its more of a masa ball cooked in the corn husk. Best service with very knowledgeable staff and friendly.",

The gala apple and maytag bleu cheese salad. She had the bbq lamb cobb salad. I had the Pork Tenderloin Pressed Sandwich with his Southwestern Fries.  Everything was AWESOME.  Top notch.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I sat down here for an early lunch without knowing what to expect considering this was a Bobby Flay joint. Even though the guy is a manchild, he makes some tasty looking food on that one network channel. I got the Bobby Flay flavored burger (you read correctly) which was excellent but not in my personal top 5 burgers of all time list. Possibly it could be somewhere on the end of my top 13 burgers of all time list. My girlfriend's tuna/avocado/whatever sandwich was definitely on my top 1 tuna/avocado/whatevers of all time list, possibly because its the only one I've had. We also had mimosas made with freshly squeezed OJ that made the meal.",

I'm not one to pick up a salt shaker very often, but I really wanted to, however there isn't one.  You'll be shamed into asking for it.  I would try it again, but spend more time on the menu.  This goes on my Vegas \"B\" List for the time being.",

When my friends ask me the best meal I've ever had I answer \"Bobby Flay's pork tenderloin at Mesa Grill in Vegas.\"  It was incredible in every way.  I've seen Bobby Flay countless times on Food Channel and if he'd come to the table it wouldn't have added anything....I was already won over.  I think I lost some serious $$ that day too, but it didn't really matter.",

    "text": "This is my third time eating at Mesa.  I didn't yelp it the first two times because everything I wanted to say was already written.  Then I realized Yelp isn't only about the restaurant, but also about the reviewer, so I thought I would review it just to add to my reviews.  I had the signture pork tenderloin.  The previous two times, somebody else ordred it and I'm the kind of person who wants to see variety on the table.  I was in Vegas by myself, so this was a perfect time to try the Tenderloin.  WOW!!  As good as everyone else has described.  The habanero tint to the sauce on top really gives it a nice heat.  Not too hot.  Just a warm feeling.  I asked for it Medium Rare nowing all chefs working with pork will tend to overcook it.  So, I got it between medium and medium rare.  Just the way I was expecting it.",

    "text": "I'm definitely borderline obsessed with this place and maybe would drive to Vegas just to come here, which I know is sick. My gf and I have been here twice now and just went here a few days ago with 3 of our friends for brunch. The first time we came here was a year ago (not sure why I didn't yelp it then) and we started with the Tiger shrimp corn tamale, which was fabulous. Pretty much any time there's a sweet corn tamale involved, I'm sold and this plus giant shrimp was insanely amazing. At that time, I got the steak and eggs, which is something I never get, but figured it would be out of this world at Bobby Flay's joint, and I was not disappointed. The portion was huge and the eggs and steak were perfectly cooked along with the grits that accompanied it. My gf got the chicken hash and loved it, although it wasn't my favorite thing. Flash forward to present time and we all got different things and everyone left happy, satiated, and tipsy. This time, my gf and I split the scrambled eggs chilaquiles with a side of the spicy chorizo sausage and both agreed that it was perfect. One of my friends ordered off the prix fixe meal and got the Tuna \"tacos\" to start and the crabcakes as her entree. The tuna was amazing and had lots of flavor and I would definitely order that. The crab cakes I didn't try, because I don't care for them, but my friends and gf all thought they were pretty mediocre and boring. One of my other friends got a shrimp taco special that was awesome and my other friend got the gala apple salad that was overflowing with maytag blue cheese and was sooooo good! Two of our friends got the white peach margaritas, which were really tasty and perfectly strong. My gf got a bloody Maria and our other friend got a bloody Mary; they both had to send the first round back because the horseradish was so overwhelming that you couldn't even enjoy the drink. Once they were remade the girls liked them, but said they were nothing to write home about and that they had both had much more interesting bloody Mary's/Maria's at other restaurants. Oh well, I was perfectly satisfied with my 5 cups of Illy coffee and amazing food. Oh yeah and you start off with a huge basket of different breads, including coffee cake, scones, yellow and blue corn bread, and jalapeno biscuits as well, which are all pretty tasty. If I could give this place a 4.5 I probably would rather than the 5, because of the boring crabcakes and the bloody Maria, but I think it's better than a 4, so I'll leave it at the 5. To be fair, any place I'd be willing to drive 4.5 hours for probably deserves a 5 anyway.",

We found the food to be fairly bland and not mediocre.  The place was beautiful, the beer and service were great, but honestly, I came for a kick-ass meal and this place flopped in that department.   Out of what we had I'd say the tuna was the best....",

All the food was good but there were definitely dishes that were way better.  I LOVED the \"Rough Cut Tuna 'Nachos'\", \"Tiger Shrimp + Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale\" and the \"Toasted Coconut Layer Cake\".  The bread basket had variety and the blue corn bread muffins and jalepeno cheddar bread were pretty delish. For the main course, we had \"Coffee Rubbed Filet Mignon\", \"Ancho Chile-Honey Glazed Salmon\" and \"Lamb Shank Posole\".  They were all good but none were great. The meats were cooked nicely but I imagined the flavors would be more \"in your face\".  The sides were forgettable. I still crave the appetizers and would like to try some of the other dishes so I would go back.",

    "text": "If you know who Bobby Flay is then you will know that walking into one of his busily packed restaurants without reservations especially on a Saturday evening is virtually impossible. BUT with great Vegas luck, my family of five was able to be seated ASAP w/out reservations nor wait time. It was as if they were expecting our party of 5 yet there was a crowd just behind us who ended up waiting. Screening the menu everything sounded spicy so dining with young children and a senior citizen who cannot tolerate any level of spiciness had us very concerned. To be polite we went ahead and ordered while making sure to ask our waiter the spice level of each dish ordered and he assured us that the spices were more for marinating purposes and that it would be mild to the taste unless requested to any desired spice level. We trusted him and when the food arrived, everything from apps to entrees to desserts far exceeded our expectations. It turned out to be the best meal we had on our 4 day LV trip. The deep dish banana cream pie, pork chop special and cremini mushroom quesadillas are musts! We will definitely return to try more of the menu.",
