We were seated immediately , which was great. We ordered the taco platter and one strawberry margarita. I sent the margarita back as soon as I took a few sips because it was clearly nothing but juice. It was basically downhill from there. Our food came and was cold :/ the hottest thing on the plate was the tortilla shells and those were \"warm\". We seen our waiter maybe twice the entire time. We actually seen the lady who took our picture more than the waiter. The food was good but like I said it was cold. The only reason why we didn't send it back was because we had been drinking all day and was starving. Now that I've experienced it I definitely won't be back and I'll be sure to tell ppl the experience I had. Even the soda was flat smh terrible",

    "text": "We came here on our last day in Vegas after picking up show tickets at the Wynn. My companions went to eat in the food court two floors up but I decided I wanted something different, so my boyfriend and I came here.  We decided to try a few appetizers as not to ruin our appetites for dinner and ended up splitting an order of nachos with pulled chicken and tamales,which neither of us had ever had.  Service here wasn't super fast, they were kind of busy but not too busy. I'm not sure if the kitchen was just slow or something but service could have been faster and more... together. We had one server, then another and then another I think.  The nachos we had here were quite good - you can tell the nachos aren't from a bag here and if they were, they're pretty damned fresh. The chicken on top was nicely spiced and had been cooked in a sauce with some onions so that really added to the flavor of the nachos. The tamales were something else. I had no expectations on what a tamale would be like, so when I dug into the soft, almost mushy tamale, I didn't know what to expect.  Flavor town indeed! WOW. So good. I was expecting something much more savory but this tamale was pretty sweet but it was SO good. I would try tamales anywhere after that experience. We split both dishes and couldn't quite finish but it was an excellent meal.  Overall, aside from the slower service, the food here was excellent. I would come back, its in a good location and you can sit on a patio without being in direct sunlight after walking around the strip for a while.",

Fresh made chips, salsa so good! Drinks were made great, got some margaritas, strawberry margaritas made awesome. The food was legit, really fresh, all tasted fresh, the carne Asada tacos I got were amazing! Great portion sizes! Highly recommend this place for some food!

It was a disaster. Ill just list things in the order I remember them. It took about 10 minutes for the waiter to take our drink order. Then he came back and took our appetizer order and dinner order (still no drinks). Appetizers came... still no drinks. The food took about 40 minutes... FOR TACOS for 6 people.. yikes! THEN OUR DRINKS CAME! So it was bout an hour that we sat there drinking water. Someone should tell this place that their rate of return on a margarita is HUGE! Too bad we only had time for 1. And yes.. we asked our server 3 times what the deal was. The tacos I had this time around were mediocre. I got the steak ones and they were too chewy.. it was hard to eat them. The meat was charred on the outside and completely raw in the middle. What a mess this place was. Never again.  Avoid if you can.",

My veggie tacos were delish! Fresh grilled veggies, cilantro lime rice, black beans, and some tasty homemade corn tortillas. The staff is super friendly and all of the food is fresh. The fresh made guacamole is a must try as well!  My brother's carne asada tacos looked great as well. It was certainly plenty of food and for 2 meals, 2 drinks, chips and salsa it was around $45. Not terrible! Would certainly recommend this place!",

Our waiter, Anthony, was nothing short of amazing. He consistently checked up on us in the most passive and unimposing way and always with a smile on his face. I can appreciate how hard that would be in a town like Las Vegas. The lamb tacos were to die for and actually came with more meat than the tortilla could handle. The service alone makes me want to come here every time I visit and the quality of food and atmosphere ensure that I will. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys an authentic culinary experience.",

I ordered the steak fajitas which happened to be some of the best fajitas I have had in Las Vegas but they were delivered by such an unhappy, unhelpful waitress (Mercedes) that it almost ruined it for me.  The rice that comes with the fajitas is fantastic as is the salsa.   After receiving horrible service, an 18% gratuity was automatically added to my bill (for a party of 5).    My kids ordered off of the Strip Burger menu (located next door but owned by the same people) and they enjoyed them.  All 3 of them ordered a milk shake to go and apparently something was wrong with my sons as it all came back up as soon as we pulled into the driveway.  I would probably return to eat the fajitas again but would specifically request not to sit in her section.  Tip-If you don't like your job, find a new one!",

We went during happy hour. Love the set up! You can either sit at the bar outside or the patio with a view of the strip, or you can sit in the bar area inside where there are also tables. The happy hour menu had a few sangrias, margaritas, and frozen drinks on the menu along with a 3 dollar tequila shot. Drinks were 5 to 3 bucks and they were really good. We had some nachos, quesadillas, and a fajita plate. I liked the nachos, loved the  quesadillas and the fajitas plate sides. The fajitas could have had more flavor to me. The beans and the rice that came with the fajitas were really tasty though. I had to ask the lady if they really made the beans in house because of how good they were. All in all great happy hour spot for some drinks, food, and a great time!   (There is a lot off construction going on right in that area though so it looks kind of crazy right now)",

The only reasoning with the two stars was because the food was delicious. Our server was the worst, not sure if she had a bad day or what but Debanjal could not be less concerned with doing her job. We watched as two other servers checked on and delivered drinks, food and pleasantries. We almost asked to switch servers. She delivered a round of drinks and stopped once to see if our appetizer was fine and then to collect our finished main dishes- commenting on how much we had eaten. While dropping off the check she never thanked us, Another server said thanks and goodbye instead. The reason for the harsh review is that both my boyfriend and I are in the service industry and couldn't believe how bad the service we received from her was. I could elaborate further but the bottom line was she ruined the dining experience. Hopefully she is retrained.",

We went only because we had fifty dollars worth of gift certificates for the place due to a bad meal we had at its sister restaurant Stripburger a few years ago. Both restaurants are owned by a group called Lettuce Entertain You. As a result of my previous experience I wasn't going with high expectations.  I was pleasantly surprised though by my entire meal. It was much better then I had hoped for and the owners completely redeemed themselves.  El Segundo Sol is located at the Fashion Show Mall across from the Wynn. It has both indoor and outdoor patio seating. We choose to enjoy the outdoor air of Vegas. Our waiter was quick to get to the table and as Simone said he was easy on the eyes so she enjoyed his attentiveness.  We started our meal with the house made bottomless chips and salsa and a pitcher of very refreshing Sangria. Although not free like some Mexican restaurants, the chips and salsa are still excellent and worth the small price you pay. The platter includes three different types of Salsa to choose from. The most mild is the simple Pico de Gallo version of chopped onions and tomatoes, a tad spicier is the green tomatillo salsa and the last salsa is a smoky charred tomato salsa. The charred tomato was my favorite and had the most flavor but all were great especially when mixed together. We actually went through two plates full of the salsa and warm crisp chips.  For her meal Simone got the Huitlacoche Quesadilla. It was a large house made soft tortilla grilled and filled with earthy truffle mushrooms, sweet corn, Mexican spices and a creamy cheese blend.  I found it to be a bit light on the truffle flavor but Simone really enjoyed it and ate the whole thing except the few bites I stole. As is the case with almost all my mexican meals, l had to choose the Braised Pork Tacos.  The Taco's do not come assembled for you but I find that to be a lot of fun as it gives you permission to play with your food at the table and you can customize your taco to your liking.  The Pork plate comes with the generously and mildly cumin and chili spiced shredded pork with fresh cilantro leaves, a Caramelized Pineapple wedge, green chilies, Cilantro Rice, Black beans, Sour Cream and Pico de Gallo.  It is all served with those very good house made soft tortillas. I just took a little bit of everything on the plate mixed it all up and shoved it in my mouth. All the flavors matched up like the perfect marriage and exploded on your tongue like the perfect honeymoon.  It was pretty amazing and memorable.  I could have used a little bit more of it all as it was so good but it was satisfying filling.  I think this is now my second favorite Mexican place in Vegas ( Chipotle still wins the first place slot).  With or without a gift certificate, I would absolutely go back again. The prices are a little high but on par with the other places on the Vegas Strip. My faith has been restored in the Lettuce Entertain you restaurant  group. This was a great all around experience.",

    "text": "Best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas!  Here are a few suggestions for you when you go.     First off the frozen margaritas are the best deal in Vegas!  My favorites so far are the Mango, The Big Stick and the Two tone sangria (frozen margarita with a sangria float...mmmmm. You can actually taste the flavor of the tequila instead of a margarita syrup slushy that you get along the strip! :) The last time we went in we ordered the guacamole which is Deeeelicious! It came out with warm chips and a yummy salsa! The beautiful guacamole girls let my children join in on the fun of making the guac for our table which they really enjoyed participating in. :) As for appetizers, go for the chicken taquitos and the cheese fundido. The chicken taquitos are wrapped with butter lettuce, jicama, and a red chile pepper. SooOooo good! The cheese fundido my kids tore up in seconds! They made mini cheese burritos with the warm corn tortillas that were brought out with them.   Now, onto dinner. I got the Baja fish tacos that were lightly battered mahi mahi strips. It was a dyi taco platter which was wonderful for my picky kids. The tacos are served with a side of  cilantro rice (that was perfectly cooked btw....not overcooked like most Mexican resturants) and black beans, that were fabulous ! My friend that came along with us ordered the shrimp fajitas. OMG! The shrimp fajita platter is massive....it comes with jumbo marinated shrimp, warm flour tortillas, cilantro rice, black beans, yummy grilled veggies n sides of sour cream and salsa.   By the time everyone was finished our waitress somehow persuaded us to get dessert. My girlfriend n I  ordered the coconut flan and the kiddies all ordered the paletas (Popsicles). The flan was light and creamy and devoured by all of us. The children ordered the mango and coconut popcicles. These popcicles you can tell are freshly made at the resturant with fresh fruit purees and chunks of fresh fruit. The kids loved them! So yummy!   We had a wonderful experience here! Oh ya, and If you can get your eyes off of your food....look around at the staff....I will say, they've got a very good looking staff!   Anyhow, thank you lettuce entertain you for yet another wonderful place to eat in las vegas! :) I'll be back!",

In fact, they're connected with Strip Burger so if everyone in your group can't agree, you're able to order from either menu. I will admit, for Mexican food that this place is kinda pricey. The table side guacamole is great, and the slow cooked pork with pineapple is fantastic. Everything is served with fresh, hot corn tortillas and the service is always great.",

    "text": "Walking down the strip and you see a huge sign that says margaritas and tacos obviously that's going to grab my attention. So we go in to check the place out it was happy hour so we were able to just walk in and grab a seat if there was any available which there was. They came and took our orders right away I ordered a strawberry margarita and a pork belly taco and a chicken taco. Now the reason I give this place a lower rating is because everything just took so long to get to us and I understand a place on the strip is probably super busy but we could literally see people just standing around it wasn't crazy busy they were just taking there time with everything. Our drinks probably took almost ten minutes to come out and the food probably 20 min just for 2 tacos! I will say the pork belly taco was very delicious  the chicken taco though was very dry and not very good. The drinks were okay they weren't to sweet so that was good. I think total time we probably stayed there close to 2 hours. I probably wouldn't go here again I'm sure there is better places on the strip.",

    "text": "I was very satisfied to visit this Mexican restaurant situated on the front side of the Fashion Show Mall on the Las Vegas strip. We enjoyed their gorgeous outdoor patio area with misters and a tree growing through the center. They have a large ornate inside seating area as well as an indoor and outdoor bar. The staff was clean, polite, knowledgeable, and seemed to enjoy their job which was a nice change from some restaurants. The fresh tortilla chips and half a dozen dipping choices were really enough to call it quits and just had back the menu. But whose a quitter.   The guacamole was made from scratch and was served in a bowl as heavy as a boulder. The spices and lime were on point for this delicious treat, and was no where near a dent made, when I took my last bite. My bf ordered the tacos and said the steak was seasoned to perfection. No complaints from me on El Segundo Sol, it was a delightful  lunch. Highly recommend.",

Happy hour deals are a steal. $4 shots of tequila, $5.50 margaritas, can't beat that. The bowl of guacamole we got was sizable and delicious, much better than I expected and actually had a kick, something lacking in most restaurant guacamole. Tacos are small, but delicious. Overall, good spot that I would definitely come back to for happy hour.",

Drinks: I ordered a raspberry margarita, which was the special at the time. Very sweet, which I love. A little light on the alcohol though. Didn't feel much drinking it on an empty stomach. Get the biggest size if you're ordering a margarita.   Food: For starters we ordered the bottomless chips and salsa. I was not pleased that you had to pay $5 for chips and salsa, as every Mexican restaurant EVER doesn't charge. The chips weren't my favorite, but you got a selection of 3 salsas, all of which were good. None were very spicy, if you're into that.   For an entree I got the chicken enchiladas, which were absolutely delicious! Covered in a tasty verde sauce and filled with tender chicken. The cilantro rice was especially good on the side. My girlfriend got the mahi mahi tacos, which were also great. I'm not a fish person and I enjoyed them!  Service: Our server was very nice, but didn't check in on us often enough, so I passed on a second margarita. Their loss.   Overall, great food and a mostly positive experience. Would eat here again.",

There's no sense of organization, hostess were all over the place; we noticed our server KARA seem like a beginner but then my family & I made up our mind & concluded that she just didn't care about accommodating. After a while of waiting at our table, she finally decides to take our order, she never offered to take our drink order. After getting our food, she disappears again for a good hour & still no drinks other than water. My sister finally caught her & ordered her drink, took my mom's drink order & just walks away... didn't even bother to ask for the rest of us... there was 7 of us. Kara homegirrrrl, quit getting so distracted & focus on your tables please; we notice everything. Overall our experience wasn't as enjoyable as they were before.",

It is nothing like being in Mexico unless you go to an Americanized mexican restaurant there.. Read the other reviews, tacos, fajitas, rice and beans, guacomole, overpriced margaritas.  I can find that all over Las Vegas and you can probably find that in your home town.  The decor is fun but very noisy as it is open to the street.  The place is overpriced, well maybe not for the strip but based on the food it is too expensive for us to want to return and we even had a travelzoo discount.  Don't be fooled, this is a classic, chain-style mexican restaurant.  You can pay half as much, get bigger drinks and enjoy yourself as much at lots of other places.  I do want to say the service was great.",

    "text": "To be fair, my expectations were misaligned from reading the reviews. I did not realize this was a restaurant in a mall that had more of a chain feel to it. It was not what I was looking for and started the evening off wrong. The acoustics were not great and it was difficult to have a conversation over dinner. They had several large groups roll in and it just got very noisy. Had I been looking for something for a group with a great tequila selection, this is the place.   So, if you have your expectations set appropriately, this could be a fun place, but fine dining it is not and it is on the pricey side. Our waiter, Victor, was very attentive and informative. He did great. I was looking at the carne asada tacos, but noticed they had pork belly in a speciality dish. I asked if they could do pork belly tacos and he was able to make it happen. They were very good. My girlfriend's carne asada was also cooked very well and flavorful. Their chips and salsa were great with the serrano salsa being the best. Their specialty hot habanero was too strong on the habanero flavor, but had great heat. I would say skip the guacamole. It was not as flavorful as it should have been and was far from spicy.   They do have an excellent selection of tequila, but our mixed drink seemed light on the tequila.  It is unlikely that I will return when back in Vegas, but this works for a lot of people and may be worth trying if you have the right mindset.",

Half the food was barely warm when it arrived. Margaritas were meh. Steak fajitas were good but overall kind of bland. Realized today that the $100 deposit was not applied to the bill so we called to ask. They probably don't expect people to remember and just keep it. Event person for the restaurant says \"I'm not back till Tuesday and I'll have to take a look then.\" Totally unprofessional.",

Just another fancy overpriced restaurant on the strip that serves what they think is Mexican food.   I came here for a work lunch so alcohol was out of the question. Maybe if I had a few drinks, the food would have tasted a little better. I ordered the tortilla soup and chipotle Cesar salad. The soup itself tasted like a can of chillies blended with a can of tomatoes. I probably got about 3 table spoons of actual pieces of tortilla, chicken and beans. I couldn't even get half way before I just have up. The salad was wilted and not fresh. And I don't know about you, but I don't think Cesar dressing is supposed to be sour. A few people at my table ordered chicken enchiladas and burritos and they all agreed the chicken was a bit dry. I tried the cilantro rice and it was complete mush. The consensus at my table was that the food was just ok. Highlight of the meal was the chips and guacamole. Pretty sad I would say.",

    "text": "Segundo sol would probably not be my primero choice for Mexican food in vegas.... or anywhere near the top for that matter.   The food is good, service is friendly, but there was not much memorable about this place for me. And when you are paying $15-$20 for tacos it had better be darn memorable. Nothing particularly wrong with it, but just not worth the money.   I had the bottomless chips and salsa (but bottomless and $4 is decidedly inferior to bottomless and free like most Mexican places), and the pork tacos. The 3 salsas that came with the chips were OK but not very fresh tasting... but ill give it to you though that it's probably hard to make good pico de gallo in January.  Pork tacos were also good but did not particularly impress.   For those price inelastic folks out there though, the ambiance of the place is great: they have a nice indoor and outdoor bar, a TON of tequilas, and there is an upscale but still laid-back feel to it. So if you don't mind paying $40 for a meal you could get off the strip for $12, then by all means give it a try.",

I'm giving this place a 2 star instead of 1 because honestly the guacamole was amazing and the speed it took to get the food out was extremely fast.  The manager mark came to help bring out the drinks after we went to the bar to try to get our own drinks since our server Maddie wasn't bringing them out. We quickly cancelled our order because this service was horrible. Maddie did not try to rectify the situation at all. My fiance who works in the same mall that always has meetings at this location with all her staff might not be back due to this horrible service. I would love the manager mark to get back to me and try to resolve this issue",

Please, you gotta serve the chips on the house to call yourself a Mexican restaurant.  No chips for me! I had a prickly pear 'rita on the rocks which was muy tasty and generous on the tequila. The pork tacos platter was good, but hardly $15.95 good. The platter comes with 5 street taco sized corn mini tortillas and there was plenty to go on those. I requested the hottest salsa and it was hot and surprisingly not tomato based. Some yellow pepper...I think. Wasn't crazy about it but it went ok with the regular salsa. Service was meh, there were only a few diners where I was and my server never even asked to refill my marg!  Can't think of a good reason to come back unless I need to use up some diner's club credit.",

The seating kinda sucked, but hey it was busy so we understand.  The waitress had a strong accent but hey it's a Mexican restaurant. My first thought was are they trying to be overly fancy here? The waitress would come and serve me water when we had the jug there. I can do it myself but a nice gesture.  When we were ready to order the waitress would suggest to my gf what to get. She thought the tacos were all pre made but you get the tortillas and make em yourself with the Ingredients you get. I ordered the mahi mahi tacos thinking that sounded good. Turns out they were good anyways. For my first time having fish. Ha. Ha.  Anyways my gfs plate was small cause she didn't order the beans/rice but she told the waitress never mind. The waitress had poor listening skills. The beans were really good and so were the tortillas. Other than that, this wasn't worth the price but still decent. I left no tip for the waitress having mediocre communication skills.  Also chips and salsa we ordered was pretty good. Nothing special.",

    "text": "El Segundo Sol is the crazy cousin of the Stripburger. Owned by the same person/people/corporation, it sits next door to the Stripburger. We stopped by for lunch before headin' out to the airport.   The hostess advised there was a 20 minute wait. Looking in the bar area we noticed several people enjoying their meal there. Noticing several tables in the bar area empty we asked if we could order from the bar and the hostess said yes but only if you sit at the bar. So we grabbed a table in the bar area and told her to keep us on the list for a table in the dining area. Within a few minutes a manager looking type came up to us, gave us water and asked if we would be ordering off the menu. We said yes and as he walked away to get our menu the hostess barreled into him and they had a brief animated exchange. He dropped off some menus and said someone would help us shortly. Ooooookay, seems like we can get service in the bar area away from the bar. Whilst perusing the menu the very affable bartender came up to our table to take our drink order. I opted for the Agave Cooler, a delightful concoction of agave nectar, fresh mint and Cruzan light rum. Ahh a refreshing and perfect cocktail for a bright, warm-ish day. H chose the house margarita on the rocks and seemed to enjoy his choice also.  Not wanting to eat anything heavy I ordered the vegetable quesadillas. H wanted the crispy tacos until he found out the beef was shredded and not the ground variety. He ended up ordering the beef quesadillas which the waiter warned also had shredded beef but it was slow-braised boneless shortrib. Noting the chip and salsa was listed as an appetizer, we went ahead and ordered it (it's $2.95). The chips and salsa is a large basket that comes with 3 bowls: pico de gallo, tomatillo salsa and a red salsa. After finding we were from Texas, the server insisted on bringing us a bowl of the chef's specialty salsa. He mentioned it had some heat to it and walked away. 'Had some heat' I scoffed, 'bring it on'. I tell ya, whatever this sh*t is, it packs heat. It's a green sauce (not salsa) that they swear has no tomatillo or avocado. Apparently, it's a well guarded secret.  Friendly staff, convenient location, not terribly pricey and decent food. I'll be visiting El Segundo Sol again.",

    "text": "Food: Okay Mexican Food Staff: Okay Staff Atmosphere: Indoor/outdoor seating, bar seating Parking: Mall parking  I was looking for some Mexican food and the Strip and came along this place.  It had A/C and was open so it met my requirements.  The chips and salsa were okay.  The chips taste a lot like Fritos once they have cooled down and without salsa.  Depending on how you feel about Fritos that is a good or bad thing.  The Guacamole had a little too much lime and the portions seemed a little small for $9.  The Street tacos were good and the liked the presentation of the meat in the little cast iron pot.  The only negative was that the meat was a little greasy at the bottom of the pot.  Other than that it wasn't too bad.  The food fit the bill, but I won't be craving it any time soon.  Ordered Dish: - Chips and Salsa - Guacamole - Braised-beef Street Tacos",

They are a pretty average restaurant, some dishes are very good, others are just standard.   One of my favorite appetizers was their fresh guacamole which is delicious! El queso fundido is another great option. For the main entree we got tacos and enchiladas. I think the enchiladas are probably a much better option. The segundo sol has great happy hour. It goes from 4-7 and you can get delicious and affordable margaritas for less than 5 dollars!",

My family and I were walking down the tourist trap and got hungry so we wanted a quick snack and some drinks. We didn't have to wait for a table and our server was understanding we were just there for a snack and drinks. We got their bottomless chips & salsa, guacamole, and drinks. I got the Sangria and it was pretty good! Not too sweet either. My boyfriend got the Michelada and that was just as good! The guacamole is made fresh to order, so expect it to take a little longer to come out. A little late, but so worth the wait. If we didn't have reservations for a dinner buffet, I would be so down to try more of the food on their menu. Everything looks delicious.",

I imagine that it could be a pretty happening spot with in an outdoor seating.  We started off with an order of the bottom list chips and salsa which were delicious. The chips could be dipped in three different types of salsas. One was a red spicier salsa, the second was a green tomatillo salsa , and the last one was a pico de gallo salsa. I personally love the pico de gallo salsa. It was fresh and I had a little spice to it.  I ordered the mahi-mahi tacos and they were absolutely scrumptious. I love the fact that it wasn't super fishy and that you build your own tacos on your plate. The tortillas were homemade and thick. I love the rice because it had cilantro and had a hint of lime. Overall I would definitely get this entree again.   Convenient location and delicious food. Love the vibe. We will be back.",

He made it & left it far from me to reach so I wasn't sure if it was mine or if he left to get the garnish.  Also there was no straw.    Bartenders usually put your drink in front of you when they're finished making it.  He said I don't garnish, your garnish is on the beer & the straw is over there.  I said oh, last time you did.  He argues back, 'I serve a lot of people so don't remember you.'  I said I'm not asking if you remember me, just how to garnish the drink, also when I'm at the inside bar they also do.  He said the outside bar is different than the inside bar.  Really, isn't this the same restaurant as in there... guess not.    Not the point.  Really I don't want attitude over anything as petty as he was creating it to be so we decided to eat elsewhere.  Three times I've eaten there wasn't good so no need to give them another chance or refer them to friends.  Shitty attitude & food, no thanks.  I'm a local, a foodie & this area has fantastic food & way better service than what's offered at El Segundo.",

Appetizer - Bottomless tortilla chips and dips: I could've just eaten these alone and called it a day. The chips were served hot on a baking pan along with pico de gallo and tomato and roasted tomatillo salsas.   Entree - Baja Fish Tacos: If I wanted to construct my own fish tacos, I would've just made them at home. Instead, I was given a plate of ingredients, including a side of tiny tortillas which were smaller than the palm of my hand. The fish \"nuggets\" were lightly-battered and fried -- they're golden and delicious. The coleslaw, rice, and beans were good.   Service - Granted, the restaurant was busy, but service could've been better. We ordered guacamole twice and never received it.   Other - Dining out on the patio was uncomfortable; though, it offers a partial view of the Wynn and Strip traffic. Keep on the look out for birds.  Overall - No bueno.",

You can wander the strip for days overpaying with your tears at other places for bland food or just come here and get a superb meal, welcoming environment and very knowledgeable staff. $5 for unlimited hand made chips and 3 types of salsa. We had the Tinga chicken enchiladas and chicken fajitas. Prices were extremely reasonable, and the fajitas honestly came with a wow factor on presentation. Both dishes were outstanding, the chicken was so tender, juicy and wonderfully balanced seasoning. The rice, oh the rice! Anybody remember when Pee Wee Herman married his jello back in the 80's? This rice could easily be husband #3 in my book! It is so rich, buttery, hints of garlic, onion and honesty there is some herb I can't even pinpoint but if you are eating on a budget just have the rice and a glass of water, you won't regret it! They have a wonderful building, shaded from the heat if you choose patio dining and inside is warm wood tones and cozy lighting, I will never overpay for another vegas meal and each dish taste like your grandma is cooking with all her love.",

I got the margarita of the week, watermelon mint. YUM  I made the mistake of getting the medium instead of the large and had to get a second...lol.  My guy got a tall boy PBR can after his draft beer...hilarious.  We got the chips and salsa app.  These are some of my favorite house made chips in Vegas and their red and green salsas are delicious.   The pico is just okay, in my opinion.  For entrees we got Carne Asada and shrimp tacos.  The Carne Asada was cooked perfectly and the shrimp was okay.  Unfortunately, we were too tanked up on chips & drinks to enjoy the entrees, but they were good.",

Even though it's on the strip, it's not much of a pain to get to because of the elevator that takes you up directly to it. What's awesome about their happy hour is the tacos and taquitos. What's great too is that modelo is part of happy hour which happens to be a favorite beer of mine. If beer isn't your thing, their margaritas are petty good too. Besides their happy hour, the food is pretty good too. If sitting at the bar, there's a nice place to sit and people watch everyone on the strip. If you're just visiting or a local, I recommend coming here at least once.",

The beer selection is rather limited as most places on the strip, they're margaritas are great, I'm just not much of a tequila person. I do feel like you get better service at the bar. This past visit we went with kids and say at the normal tables, the service was terribly slow, but maybe that's just because we had children.  Then they ran out of the beer I ordered , apparently I \"was confused \" by the waiter on the price when he offered me another selection, as he told me multiple times when I asked about the bill. That's why I took off a star, the way in which I was spoken to, and then another star for the speed of service and our MIA waiter.

They were very accommodating of our requests from separate checks to champagne toasts. Most places also changed their menu for large groups. I think the option was there, but we chose this place because we liked their menu as it was.  In the end we did spend a lot of money... but we didn't feel ripped off.

    "text": "This place has a good food and an awesome Mango Marguerita. But Thats all they offer. Hostesses are never at the podium, you always have to wait to get a table, server takes so long to come to your table to offer a drink. I understand tha the location attracts a lot of tourist and they normally don't leave a good tip, but I'm local and always leave at least 20%. Last time I went there I promise to never go back. Just simply I changed a table the hostess came and was really impolite with me and my guests. Maybe if she was in the podium I would have the chance to ask her to change my seat but she was no where I could see her. The location was not busy, it was a Sunday afternoon. The server was really rude to tell us the drink we asked at the bar would be full price and not half of the price. Horrible service! Don't go to this place. Vegas have a lot of good restaurants to go to.",

Jen needs a class on dealing with people.  We got her name after we asked the food server.  People like her working with the  public need to change careers where there are no people to deal with.  Great food, great food service. Average drinks from below average bartender.",

I'm giving this place 3 stars due to the fact that they charge you for chips and salsa, and because the service wasn't very great. What Mexican restaurant charges for chips and salsa? The food and drinks are already pricey enough! Our server didn't visit the table frequently enough. I found myself constantly needing a refill and no one available to help. It's worth a visit, but I think they've got a few things to fix before this place hits the 5 star mark.",

    "text": "GREAT Place! My fiance and I stopped here for an early, low key dinner one night on our trip to Vegas last week.  We were just looking for a nice casual place out, after our long day at the pool, then to walk around comfortably on the strip after.  We ordered the bottomless nachos to begin and they were fresh (and I mean, the nachos themselves were hot, fresh and just made!), delicious and huge! With just the right amount of everything.  They were accompanied with 3 different salsas and we loved each one. We then ordered fajitas (1 steak entree and 1 chicken entree) and they too, were fresh, delicious and great sized portions. I didn't try any cocktails here, but my fiance was happy with the tap IPA beer the waiter recommended.  I found myself craving it again the next day while sitting at the pool, but knew I couldn't indulge in nachos again haha.  The service was a bit slower than expected, considering the place was actually pretty dead.  Had the hostess and service been a bit more attentive, I'd give it 5 stars, but overall the place was really great and we would definitely return!",

    "text": "Hmmm, it was okay I guess. Nothing wrong, but nothing outstanding either.   The hostess was very friendly and made a few jokes on our way to the table. She asked if we wanted to sit at the high tops which feature all day happy hour on Sundays, lucky for us that it was Sunday. The happy hour deals, however, weren't much to write home about. Let's see, $5 margaritas, $2.99 tequila shots, and a few apps. You can also get a few domestic tall boys for $5 and a few imports for $6. Those seem like the best deal to me.   For apps we had the spicy table side guac. I'm not really a fan of guac but this was pretty good, although expensive, $9 maybe. We also had the roasted peppers, I probably wouldn't order that again. The chips and salsa were good, although I would generally say that I enjoy any chips and salsa.   I had the shredded pork tacos. They were good but nothing remarkable. GF had the shrimp fajitas. For $19.99 I thought there might be more than 5 flippin shrimp but it was good.   For dessert we had the flan, tres leches cake and the chocolate cake. I thought the tres leches was the best and the chocolate cake was only so so. However, when dipped into the tres leches sauce, the chocolate cake was much better!   Our waitress was decent and didn't try to rush us out of there even though we stayed at least three hours.   With so many other options in Vegas I probably won't return to El Segundo Sol, especially with Ra right next door.",

Our waitress was not great- she was busy and kept forgetting our drink orders- (I mean come on- write it down already!)   It was also SO dark in there we could barely see the menu- this is not an exaggeration.  They charge $2.75 for chips and salsa as an appetizer- which is always surprising to me at mexican food restaurants.  The food was mediocre, the margarita primero was watered down (after the server had to be reminded that we ordered it twice).  They charged 18% gratuity for our large party which was an unfortunate way to end the night.",

I'm a fan!\", which I am, but not with that much enthusiasm. I guess I'll have to stick with 3-stars and an 'A-OK' style.   The food is your average mexican food, with nothing that blows me away. You either love or hate their rice -- which I happen to hate. They do offer a Gluten-Free menu which is beneficial to those who require it.   They serve you water in a glass bottle that they clearly fill up from the sink. It is so tacky and seems really unsanitary. If you are going to bring a bottle of water, make it fancy or stick with the ice water in the cup.   Bottom line: nothing special, but not horrible. It's great if you want decent mexican, but there are several other places that, for the same price, will be much better.",

She got a vegetarian taco plate and I got a pulled pork taco plate.    My pulled pork was not what I was expecting, but I thought it was okay.    The service here was lacking though.  Our waiter brought us chips and salsa even though we said we didn't want any when he asked.  And then he insisted that we had ordered it.  Of course he had to take it back, and we felt a little bad but we could noticeably tell that he was annoyed at us.    He was overly attentive though.  He kept on filing my glass of water even though the pitcher of water was on the table.  And he kept on coming by to ask us, \"do you have everything you need right now?\" often interrupting our conversation.    On the whole I think if you're in the mood for slightly expensive Mexican food (about $15 a plate) then this place is worth checking out.  But I probably won't be back here until after I've checked out all the other places on the strip.",

    "text": "Being a concierge, I really, really wanted to love this place.  I decided to try it one day after work and invited a friend along.  The service was horrible.  Since it was Happy Hour, you have to sit in the bar area, which we did.  The hostess greeted us with \"are there 4 more people joining you\"?  We told her no, but there were no smaller tables, and we are more than happy to let someone else sit with us, if needed.  She kind of gave us a dirty look and walked away.  About 5 minutes later, she silently filled our water glass, and gave us menus... the REGULAR menu, and walked away, again, in silence.  When she finally reappeared, we asked if we cold possibly get the HAPPY HOUR menu.  Instead of just getting it and bringing it over, she had the young man who was busy taking drink orders bring it to us...ten minutes later (not his fault, he in fact, was the only redeeming thing about the place).  We ordered a few appetizers, which were actually very good.  The chips, salsas, and guac, were fantastic,  the margaritas were wonderful.   We ate, drank and vowed never to return.  I decided to give them one more chance.  So I went again, this time, just for some drinks.  I sat at the bar and was ignored by the \"bartender\" for several minutes (she wasn't busy).  Finally, she approached me and asked what I wanted.  She wasn't very friendly.  (Hey management, apparently, your staff don't like their jobs, hire some people who would be grateful to have one).  Sorry El Segundo, I will not be recommending this establishment to any guest of mine.  You will find them all next door, at Strip Burger, with the fun, cool bartender and awesome wait staff.  Soon after writing this reveiw, the owner/partner of the establishment reached out to me to apologize for my experience.  I cannot even describe how very cool that is.  I am only sorry I just noticed this today and not six months ago.  I feel it is only fair to mention this, as it speaks volumes that he took time to address my concerns.  My apologies to him for taking so long to respond.",

    "text": "I went here on Sunday before the Beatles Love show which was AMAZING but that's a whole other review. I'm giving it 4 stars though it does have some pros and cons.   PROS:  * It's a cool place, sort of a hectic vibe, and loud, but cool just the same  * The margaritas are *$%#-ing amazing! You will want more than one, so just get the 32 oz up front.  I got 1 strawberry and 1 mango, both awesome. * The guacamole is also stellar, a large portion and really good!  *The food is good, not out of this world like the guac and margaritas but definitely good  *I heard from another vegetarian that the veggie tacos, which is more like fajitas than tacos are super awesome. The best she said, EVER.   CONS:  * Chips and salsa are not complimentary, they cost 2.75  * The service is SLLLOOOOW, it's busy so be prepared to wait. We waited over 45 mins for food at 8pm on a Sunday. * My friend got the beef quesadilla, which was beef, cheese and jalapenos (WAY too spicy for her, she couldn't eat it)  *It's fairly pricey, the large margarita is 21 or 22 bones.  *LOUD, if you want a quiet place, this is not for you.  *No burritos here, if you like burritos don't bother, they have zero   All in all if you have the cash to spend and you're looking for a fun, upbeat vibe this would be perfect for you. It's on the strip, at the Fashion Show mall, easy walking distance from a lot of hotels. If you're in a small group and get the chips. salsa and quac I would suggest getting only apps.  The tacos look like a LOT of food, I could only eat part of the quesadilla after the guac.   I will definitely come back again when I don't have a time restraint.",

Friend and I shared nachos and a mixed fajitas plate.  I also had a mango margarita.  It might've been because I had only slept 2 hours the night before or that I really haven't drank in like two years (was pregnant then nursing baby) but man that thing was strong!  I literally drank about a quarter of it I was starting to feel a bit...warm.  :)  The food:  B+ Nachos - Ok.  Can't really mess up nachos, right?  This one had the right ingredients.  I give it a B.  (Not sure nachos can ever really get above a B.  It's just stuff on top of chips.)  Fajitas - Steak was grilled perfectly.  Meat was tender and juicy.  Shrimp was large and tasty.  Grilled vegetables were yummy.  Liked that it wasn't just the typical mix of bell peppers and onions.  They also included grilled asparagus.  I give it an A-.  Service:  D SLOW!  We went around 3pm.  After the lunch crowd and before the happy hour crowd.  Yet our waitress was hardly around and when she was she just seemed so disgruntled.  We literally had to get up and hunt someone down to pay our bill.  Ambiance/Decor: B+ Twinkly lights get me every time!  :)  But the mish mash of tables  on the patio are really crowded and hard to navigate (especially with a stroller).",

True, the prices are a bit more than what we locals would normally pay for food of this portion.  Food quality was great, especially assemble-yourself fish tacos, and the sangria's made the evening even more enjoyable....but the \"ding\" I have to give is on their service.  Nothing more can ruin a great experience if the service is horrible.  My memorable evening began the moment we sat down...the water server immediately came and poured water, but it was nearly 10 minutes before a server appeared and took our order.  Having to wait that long, we thought it was wise to order appetizers and dinner....with the words to the waiter \"please do not bring the main course until  we've finished our chips and guacamole.\" Sure enough, appetizers came (guac but no chips until after we said something) and the moment we put a chip in our mouths....here comes a server with our main course.  I told the server to take it back as we just got our appetizers.  I then finally flagged down our waiter to let him know what happened, to which he replied, \"I don't handle your table any more...they moved me...\" and he walks away.  Incredible.  Great Customer Service, huh?!?  Moments later a young female waitress stopped by and asked if there was a problem and why we sent the meal back.  I told her what we experienced and requested fresh food (not our previous dishes that probably went back under a heat lamp) be served after we've finished with our appetizers.  Granted the floor manager stopped by to apologize and comped the guacamole, we just felt rushed.  Also, be prepared to talk loud as the steady \"thump, thump, thump\" of their music system will drown out any normal conversation.

    "text": "Fancy freshly made guacamole? Delicious sangria? Fajitas seasoned to perfection? Then try El Segundo.  I was a previous fan of the once Cafe Baba Reba, but the owners of this venue decided to go bigger with their Spanish themed restaurant. With a new look and a whole new menu, El Segundo Sol is absolutely delicious in my opinion!   You have your choice of indoor or outdoor seating, and with the weather as perfect as it is at this moment, I recommend the outdoor seating. Your outdoor table will be tucked under some strategically placed trees, adorable lighting and accompanied with a fantastic view of entertainment filled Las Vegas Boulevard.   The service started off a bit rocky but after some light banter, and a few smiles, we were on a roll!   Chicken fajitas, fresh guacamole, delightful salsa, and satisfying sangria; this meal was hands down, one of the best I've experienced in a while in the way of Mexican food.   Give it a whirl, and be patient if the service isn't fantastic, the food certainly makes up for any dining experience hiccups!",

    "text": "Located on the outside of the Fashion Show Mall, right on the strip, beneath Capital Grille and Maggiano's, El Segundo Sol is an easy to access option when you're walking around, starving for something to eat, preferably for the happy hour.  They have a really cheap happy hour menu, which actually has a good amount of variety.  I think the tacos were $2-3 each, but be warned that most of the portions here are on the small side.  I had 3 tacos and was not stuffed...  I don't know if this place is a chain, but it's like a slightly more modern/fresher version of a \"Mexican\" (Americanized) chain like El Torito, where you shouldn't expect any authentic, but everything's pretty tasty.    A bonus was that the margaritas were surprisingly not watered down during happy hour either!",

My friend and I hiked from the Riviera and were welcomed by misters on the patio and giant frozen margaritas! My friend had the mango marg and said only wonderful, glowing things about it. I stuck with PBR tall cans and bottomless chips & salsa (which came with 3 flavors of salsa). Fantastic!  This is just a really chill place to enjoy a cocktail and some mexican grub. The misters are a huge plus! The whole wait staff was nice and helpful. I'm so glad that we found this place. We will most definitely be back when in town!",

The fresh, made to order guacamole was some of the best I have ever had and the chips were warm, crispy and salty..mmm.  I also had the chicken tacos which were good but not amazing.  The chicken was a bit charred and I didn't care for the burnt edges--but an overall good taste nonetheless.  I had been on a four day bender and did not partake in the margaritas, but they sure looked good.    El Segundo would be a welcome respite from shopping or gambling, although it is on the far end of the strip.",

Please note, this is different from the normal Strip Burger menu. You have to ask for the small one page specialty burger menu, otherwise you'll get the normal menu. In any case, my taco's again were delicious as expected. Unfortunately, my friends burger was not cooked to his liking. The server didn't check back with him right away and therefore, he lost his appetite. When he complained about the burger, the server profusely apologized and promptly removed the charge from the bill. She also said that she didn't realize that the computer system didn't allow her to input in burger temperature and she will be more aware to let the kitchen know in the future if the special burgers are ordered. Nonetheless, we still had a good time. My friend, on his way out met someone at the bar and got her number.  Fun times as always at El Segundo Sol!",

She said that they will take care of us and they sure did.   We sat in the \"Tequila Room\" a private room with a long table and had the best service.  When the server brought us two huge bowls of fresh, tableside made guacamole and two huge platters of chips and salsa, I was confused and asked who ordered all this.  The server said it was on the house!   Our server was friendly, on top of it and made sure our glasses were never empty.  The busboy made sure our table was clear of any dirty dishes and the manager came by a couple to times to check on us.  Everyone was happy with their food.  They had a special that included a cheese enchilada, chicken tostada and fish taco with rice and beans.  Even though we were originally craving some pasta, this was a True blessing in disguise.  We felt like VIPs and will definitely go there again!",

I must say I did like the upscale Mexican cantina decor and there was plenty to see and great music.  I went here for dinner with a friend and we both agreed it would make a nice date spot or even pre-dinner place before partying on the strip.    I loved the chips which were freshly baked corn tortillas with an excellent sampling of salsas.  I ordered Ceviche as an appetizer which is completely unnecessary since you probably will fill up on all the addictive chips.  I had to ask for them to placed out of arms reach to avoid devouring too many. For my entree I had the tequila salmon  which came with jasmine rich that was both sticky and sweet.  The salmon was filling and tasty but not overly flavorful as what I suspected since it came out on a \"hot plate\".  The service and attention provided by the staff is certainly top notch and it ended up being a fun and enjoyable dinner.  If you're looking for something different and not too pricey on the strip this is a great place.",

The chips are great too, oh and did I mention the chips and salsa is bottomless? Not just during happy hour either, and for $2.95 its a great deal. I can't speak for any other food, but everything that came out of the kitchen looked great. We also had great service from the bartenders both visits.  We probably wouldn't have tried this place if we weren't staying at the Wynn since its right across the street from it (on the edge of Fashion Show mall), but I'm so glad we did.

Beats the fast food joints in the mall or the slightly more formal environments of Maggiano's or Capital Grille. Made a reservations on OpenTable and went shopping prior so we were running late. The host held our table for nearly 20 minutes (I called to inform them we were late - kudos!!).  Food - Amazing! Started with a couple margaritas and guac along with the fried padron peppers. The peppers were off the hook! I need to find where they are sold in California and cook me up some. The guac had mucho sabor! Deep, pronounced flavors, very fresh and abundant. Well worth the $8 (beats any other Mexican restuarant's tableside prepped guac). For dinner, we had short rib tacos, shrimp/steak fajitas and chicken tacos. All arrived together and delish! Accompaniments galore including various salsas, guac, sour cream, cute tortillas.  Service - spot on! Our server was friendly and always there without being a hover-nag. The front end manager came by to check in on us and see how we were doing as well. Water was never empty.   Deal - We snagged a $50 <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> gift certificate (make sure you buy it when they are having a promo - got it for $4!). Needed to spend $100, inclusive of alcohol, so we had no problem. Gratuity is not automatically included, so remember to tip on the full amount. We left a solid 20%.   Only reasons I shaved a star was margaritas were a bit pricey and small (should we come back and pay \"full price\") and the environment was just a couple decibles too loud. Other than that.. I'm a fan!!",

I worked with Natalie, the catering manager, over the course of a few months to plan out the perfect dinner for 12 people. Natalie was very professional and ever so helpful in planning my dinner via email. She always answered my questions thoroughly and responded quickly. She helped me to reserve the tequila room for my private dinner and I loved it! It was cozy, it had a rustic vibe with the crates and tequila bottles in the background and was totally my style! The day before my wedding I dropped off some small decoration for the table which was arranged perfectly. I selected the taco party dinner option for my guests which included a taco platter per guest with their choice of meat alongside cilantro rice and black beans. For starters, chips and salsas, guacamole, fried peppers, and a salad were included. EVERYTHING was delicious! The salad had pumpkin seeds in it which was a really nice touch as I love pumpkin seeds. All of the food tasted very fresh and all of my guests really enjoyed every part of the dinner. The drinks were also very good. I am picky about margaritas and their margaritas were really good. I forgot the name of our server, I wanna say his name was Jay but I don't remember; however, he was a very nice waiter and took very good care of us. My only regret was that I didn't have the chance to take many pictures of everything not only to share with this review but to have as a memory. Oh well, I have every intention on returning to this restaurant when I come back to Las Vegas, I actually find myself craving this restaurant now that I'm back in Miami",

    "text": "As a native Tucsonan, I am very picky when it comes to Mexican food. El Segundo Sol does the Southwest justice. They offer the classics that you yearn for like queso fundido and elote, which are both must tries. Also their margaritas are good. And a good margarita is never a bad thing. Although the prickly pear margarita is sweet, sweet, SWEET I give them points for including it on the menu.   The other reason (besides the amazing food) that El Segundo Sol is a place I love to frequent is the patio. OH, THAT PATIO. It is right off the strip and if you can get a table on the edge of the patio, people watching is a must. If you can't, which is likely for bigger groups and busier nights the entire patio is a dream. Lights, greenery, pinatas and great music makes for a fantastic meal and experience.   If you are in town and not wanting to journey far from the strip, El Segundo Sol is a must.",

I'm Local And There's A Few Tourists That Give The Typical Blah Blah Feedback. The Food Tastes So Authentic Margaritas Are Awesome Good Beer Selection. Also Great Happy Hour For Being Located On Las Vegas Blvd. Service Is On Point And Again Please Don't Complain About The 3.95$ Chips And Salsa, It's Worth It You Get 3 Different Salsa's. Do Yourself A Favor If You Choose To Complain Taco Bell Is Right Down The Street. Again People Forget That Nevada Is Located In The Southwestern Part Of The United States And North Of The Border So Yes Mexican Food Tends To Be A Little More Spicy, That's Why El Segundo Separates Themselves From Other Flop Mexican Restaurants. Enjoy!!!",

They do a great job of filling the plate with rice and beans, hoping you won't notice that the cut up chicken breast or Carne Asada amounts to less protein than you would find in a single Taco Bell burrito.   I was served the end piece of corn that would have been rejected by a pig farm in Pahrump (check out the photo). The chef should be ashamed that he sent it out of the kitchen, but that's what you get when you try to get three servings out of a ear of corn.  I'm a local, and even the 25% discount they provide won't get me to step foot in this place again.",

Thought it was rather odd that they have 3 sizes of margaritas, but whatever. Tasty and refreshing. Bartender (Courtney, I think) was friendly and attentive. No complaints there.   Ordered bottomless chips and salsa (3 different kinds of salsa). Chips, although warm, tasted stale and flavorless. Salsas tasted like something you would buy at the 99 cent store. He ordered Elote (on the cob, they offer shaved or on the cob). Came out totally charred, no mayo, barely any cotija, with a ton of chili spice and a ridiculously large amount of cilantro and butter. Actually had to send it back, after trying to be courteous and ask the bartender if that's how it's normally served, so to not be rude for sending it back. (She said no, wasn't how it should be) I ordered \"4 Cheese Queso Fundito\" without any meat (still almost $11). Let's just say you could buy a pack of shredded IMITATION mozzarella, throw a small handful on a plate, burn the crap out of it, wait for it to get cold, and that would be a perfect representation of what I ordered. We waited almost 20 minutes for them to remake and deliver his corn, which was still lacking in flavor, other than the 8 gallons of chili seasoning they covered it in once again. There is no \"wow\" factor, or even an \"ooh, let's come back and try something else\" factor. Crappy food quality for the limited menu they offer, at ridiculously high prices, even for a tourist trap.",

Sangria very mild and could use an heavier pour on the wine, but nice sized carafe.  $3 tacos and cheap quesadillas.  The salsa was good and gave you options of 3. The guacamole chunky and flavorful, though spicy is definitely not the adjective I would have used.  I also had some wine off the main menu which was limited at about 6 or 7 red options between $8 and $10.  But overall pretty cheap until 7pm and plenty of space in the bar area to appreciate the deals and a few TVs.  Nice patio area as well, though I don't think they do the Happy Hour deals out there.  As far as Mexican restaurants go, El Segundo is solid.  Not sure El Segundo is worth venturing to specifically, but if you're in the area, then surely give the guac and HH a try.",

A short walk from The Venetian hotel + Casino where we stayed, we came with a large appetite.   To start off, we each ordered the various interesting flavors of margaritas that they offer in 3 different sizes. All of the margaritas were amazing and had a generous pour in each.   For appetizers, we split the endless chips + salsa, Guacamole, and the Ahi Tuna Ceviche. The Chips were hot and fresh, the Guacamole was bomb, but the best thing was hands down the Tuna Ceviche. A great combination of sweet and citrus on a warm tortilla chip was incredible.  For my main dish I ordered the fajita platter with all 3 of the meat options (Fish, Steak, and Chicken). Each protein was cooked perfectly and came in a generous portion with beans, guac, jasmine rice, tortillas, and sauteed vegetables.   For $60/person, we walked away pretty drunk and extremely full. Awesome meal.",

It is Fashion place as others have commented and I was a little skeptical.  Don't be afraid and run here.  I sat at the bar outside as it was a beautiful day in Vegas.   Ended up ordering the Mahi Mahi tacos and they were cooked to perfection. The spices that they cooked the fish with was out of this world.  Platter was accompanied by rice and beans that topped it off.   My only complaint is that you didn't get any chips and salsa.  Also the service seemed a little slow.  Other than that it was a great lunch.",

We were told that we could sit anywhere that was open (there was a lot of open seats) and we would be helped. It wasn't until I asked one of the managers if I can get a MENU that we were able to start meal service. At this point, two other tables already received menus and water.  I ordered the chips and salsa which felt old. The guacamole arrived when we were 3/4ths the way done with the chips... Now, I know it was SEMA show in Vegas and it might be busy on the strip, but management should have prepared for the property that's on Las Vegas Blvd. -The second batch of chips were fresh and when the staff observed me taking pictures of my EMPTY Ice Tea glass, service got better. Since I've been here before, I suggest the braised beef tacos...",

    "text": "Came here late on a Friday night and pretty starving since we had just arrived in the long car ride.  This place was recommended by a local and she said this place had amazing Mexican food.  We came at like 10:30ish (I think) and was seated outside.  They covered up the overhang ceiling with fake trees and lights and you'd think it'd sound weird but it was kind of cute.  On to the food... we got chips and salsa, and gucamole as an appetizer.  We each ordered different margaritas to try and I had the organicos one with all organic ingredients (cause i'm into that shit).  It was delicious sweet and had the perfect amount of sour!  The chips with salsa and guacamole tasted delicious as well had beautiful presentation.  The salsa came out with 3 different salsas- a fresca, verde, and i think a spicy one.  My favorite was the verde and spicy.  The chips weren't too overly salted and the salsas tasted refreshing.  Usually I tend to be addicted to the salt in the chips and end up overeating but I was able to enjoy this as a True appetizer rather than overeating chips.  As far as the guacamole- it tasted amazingly fresh.  I ordered the fajitas to share and it was also seasoned very well.  It came with 6ish flour tortillas with the sizzling platter in the middle with a few accompaniments on the side in little metal containers.  It came with sides of guac, 2 salsas, sour cream, and other stuff I forgot.  The fajita plate also had a small grilled corn!  I really like that the fajitas weren't dripping in oil or had the taste of cheap butter.  In most places where I've had fajitas, ever time you scoop up the onions and peppers they are just drenched in oil.  The flavors of the spices and cooked perfection really came out with the fajitas which is huge cause usually I will taste a faint of cheap butter which I'm not a fan of.  Bf had the salmon tacos which he didn't like but I had a bite of his salmon and thought it was cooked well.  Maybe it's because he isn't accustomed to tasting salmon in tacos since the usual fish is some white fish, but I thought the plate looked very aesthetically pleasing.  I really enjoyed this meal and would definitely return.  Prices were very reasonable for a Vegas dinner coming to about $15-$18 for an average plate (not counting the few fancy items).  I wasn't amazed, but definitely impressed by the higher quality Mexican food.",

Typical Americanized-Mex menu with fajitas, enchiladas, taco platters, taquitos, etc.  I ordered an appetizer of Chicken Taquitos and a main course of Chicken Fajita platter.  The taquitos were quite awesome(i tend to use the words awesome and fuck alot in my reveiws fyi.)3 per order and served on top on lettuce , which I thought were just for presentation until the bartender informed me you can eat it like a wrap.Fuck...good. On the side its served with guacamole and some kind of sauce made from orange, which is alot spicier than I expected.Very sexy presentation.If it was a woman, I would make love to her.  The gripe I have with most Mexican joints and their fajitas, is that they tend to put a shitload of vegetables on the platter but very little steak/chicken/shrimp.Not the case here as there was a generous mix of chicken and veggies on the platter.Most joints tend to serve yellow rice and refried beans(or frijoles, as we say in Espanol.) with their fajita platters, but here they serve them with white rice and black beans.Black beans = crazy delicious, especially when you put them in a tortilla with chicken.  The margaritas here are no pussy margaritas.These things are strong and sneak up on you after you have a few.  This is definitely a repeat place for me.",

    "text": "This is my second review of El Segundo.  My first review was less than stellar.  The great part was the owner and general manager reached out to me to discuss the problems I had at the restaurant.  These guys are terrific and have excellent customer service skills.  They very politely asked if I could come back and enjoy the restaurant once again because I was an avid advocate of this establishment until I had a poor experience on my last visit.  First let me state that my return trip was excellent.  I went there with a friend and everyone from the hostess, the waiter to the manager provided excellent service.  And the food was perfect.  For the appetizer I ordered the traditional chips and salsa.  If you have not tried this you should.  The chips come with three types of salsa: a hot, mild and a Verde.  They are all excellent.  I ordered the tuna tacos which came with rice and red beans and a few mixed drinks.  I ordered the tacos since that is something I've not had before and wanted to venture into uncharted territory.  The food did not disappoint.  I highly recommend  El Segundo to anyone who likes Mexican Food along with a fun environment",

Meat quality and flavor were good. Definitely not more than a 3 star for this restaurant. If you want good and cheaper tacos go to tacos el gordo on the strip. Our server gets a 5 star though.

Everything was tasty, but even more important, the staff was right there and helped make it fun for every one of us.  We'll be going back for lunch and/or dinner...and maybe a happy hour is also in our future.  Try it--you'll like it!!!!",

Neat atmosphere, very dimly lite - bust out your flashlight on your phones when coming in the evening. Great place to entertain definitely will be coming back.

They were very accommodating when our party size fluctuated and with those with dietary requests (gluten-free for celiac and low carb). Definitely order the chips and salsa which is bottomless and comes with 3 different salsas and the el sol margaritas. I wasn't feeling terribly hungry, but ordered the elote and the chicken taquitos anyway. The elote was delish - just a tad burnt and smokey - used tortilla chips to scoop up the little nuggets of gold and cotija cheese. The taquitos were awesome - I'm still thinking about the orange salsa/sauce the dish came with. It was sweet and acidic - I even told the manager how good it was that I debated knocking back the shot before we left for the night. I would love it if I could get that recipe!!",

We arrived during happy hour but we decided to not sit in the bar area because it was fairly crowded and the seats didn't seem comfortable. We sat adjacent so we were in the action. There are no complimentary chips and salsa but we did order the bottomless option for $10. We also ordered two serving of the guacamole because it was so good. For entrees, my mom and sister split the chicken fajitas which was a large enough portion for two people. It came with about 8 tortillas. I ordered the beef enchiladas which I really enjoyed.  The cilantro rice that came with both entrees was out-of-this-world but the black beans were bland. I also ordered the cucumber mint margarita which had plenty of fresh cucumber and mint, although the medium size was fairly small. The bill was $95 which I felt was reasonable. The margarita was slightly over priced at $12, but I'm still glad I got it.",

The food is ok at best and their menu seems to be limited.  They are on the strip.  This does make it an option for locals to go here before a show or a game.  They have a full bar and frozen margarita machines on their patio.  If you are a local, I'd recommend going somewhere else.",

    "text": "This place was great! We were spending a week in Utah, and had 4 hours in Vegas to kill around sunset before our flight home.  Obviously we went on Yelp and found this place!  We weren't dressed for anything fancy (after hiking... yikes!) yet felt comfortable sitting outside here.  We actually were surrounded by a few parties who were in business casual (I think it was a large Rehearsal dinner maybe?), but the waitstaff was friendly and didn't seem to mind!  The food was amazing.  The drinks were even better!  We started off with guacamole (omg, so many avocados!!) and the endless chips/salsa.  We had to ask for a refill on the salsa, but our server was super helpful and prompt about it.  After that, we continued to drink, then decided to share the steak tacos, which we were able to order to our preference (medium, for the record) - they were delish! It came with tons of veggies, side of rice, salsa, guac, beans, and tortillas.  More than enough food, honestly!  For drinks, he ordered the Sol Marg (on the rocks) and I opted for the Frozen Prickly Pear Marg, which was just the right amount of sweet without being overwhelming!  So good!  It's a great location to people watch, if you get a table outside.  We didn't check out happy hour because we sat at a table - but their specials looked good enough!  Overall, a cute place, with great mexican food, even better margaritas, and a chill vibe.  I could see doing a big dinner here for a birthday or just with the girls - sounds fun!",

The mango was personally the better of the two. On Saturday we had the carne asada platter and it was even more juicy and delicious than the ribeye. Their shrimp is perfectly cooked and seasoned. We then had their watermelon jalapeno margarita which was my favorite off all of the ones we had. The cucumber margarita was also amazing. Hugo was our bartender and server and he too was fantastic. Loved this place better than guy fieros restaurant. Amazing food and amazing service all around. These people deserve a raise. Would go again.",

Walking up to the entrance there is a open bar to the right of you and a open dining area to the left. I really loved the way it was set up, we sat under trees lit up with lights. It was so cute and really romantic. There was music playing but where we sat we were able to hear both the malls music and the restaurants music so we kind of tuned it out.  Once we sat down the waiter quickly joined us with a personal water pitcher and served us in glasses that looked like shot glasses. My only complaint is that the water wasn't filtered and had a off put taste . Our waiter asked if would like chips with guacamole or salsa, he mentioned it was fire so we chose both and when they say fire they mean fire lol.  We ordered two different taco platters since we couldn't decide Jose offered to do half and half so my wife got the half steak and half pork taco platter with no beans extra rice  And I chose the fish taco platter  everything came out great the food was super fresh and piping hot , with really big portions and regardless of how busy it was our drink never ran low and of waiter made sure we had everything we needed, overall great experience",

We have continually brought friends and recommended this restaurant. Recently we took a friend to El Segundo only to discover that the three items that make a restaurant successful were now missing. I am referring to \"Service, Food quality and Price\". All three seem to have disappeared since our last visit. The restaurant was fairly empty when we arrived for their \"Happy Hour\" yet service was slow. We ordered their happy hour steak tacos and after a long wait they arrived. The few pieces of tasteless grizzly steak the size of a half cube of sugar we're on the most minuscule taco we have ever seen. Prices on their once reasonable menu have been raised to those of a gourmet restaurant. We will not be returning to El Segundo Sol again.",

If you are a reality star, then your lower intelligence will probably con you into thinking this restaurant is great; as the tiny portions of crappy food will keep you skinny and hungry. But if you are one of these types, please stop telling people how wonderful such horrific restaurants like this are. Just went for the review acclaimed happy hour yesterday with 4 people, and it sucked BIG TIME! The street tacos were literally one bite, and the chicken was gross, the steak was charred and they tasted disgusting. The chips were unsalted and very burnt tasting, and the salsas were nothing more than jarred grocery store taste. In addition, the salsa cups were so small that you couldn't even get your chip wet. Prickly pear margarita tasted too sweet, and should have been  more tart. Loaded nachos with chicken were like eating a wet bowl of cheeese goo, and nothing good about them. Quesadillas were overcooked and just plain wrong. You could literally order 20 street tacos for one person, and get about 3 regular size tacos in food quantity. Quality of food is poor, taste of food is poor, quantity of food is a RIP OFF. Happy hour is guaranteed to make anyone unhappy enough to never come back here again for anything. This is really sad because happy hour should make one want to come back for more, but sadly not here. STAY FAR AWAY from this establishment, it won't get better!",

Good selection of tequila includes a double barrel reposado that Herraduro did just for the chef. $13 a shot or $200 for a bottle. If you're local you can leave your dedicated bottle at the bar for your convenience. Your key chain identified you as the bottle owner when you stop in. It is a very good tequila, aroma has definite tones of whisky and tobacco. Smooth, sherry like taste upfront with a pronounced but smooth tequila backbone",

    "text": "This is the best meal at a Mexican restaurant that I've had in years. In terms of the food, everything was a notch better than one gets at most Mexican restaurants. The beans and rice, for example, were a distinct cut above the beans and rice that every other Mexican restaurant serves. And the beef enchiladas were amazing. I think they braise the beef because it had this luxuriousness to it that elevated the entire dish. So good. The menu had some interesting margaritas. The place isn't cheap, but considering the quality of the food and that it's the Las Vegas Strip, I thought the prices were pretty fair. And the service was friendly and efficient. There's no question I will run back here on my next (and every) Las Vegas trip.",

Fortunately for us, we were able to venture into this lively and fun place for some delicious margaritas (tried the Big Stick and Mango) for half price.  Their HH menu included tasty pork burritos for $4.95 ($0.95 extra for the works) and totally worth every penny!  The Espolon promotion girls came over and gave us free tequila shots. Wow, that did me over.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND for the happiest hour of your pre-party adventure in Vegas.",

The salsa, pico de gallo and green sauce all came with the chips. We ordered table side guacamole and it was the best quacamole I've ever had not to mention it came in a large bowl. A meal in itself for my hubby and me.  The braised beef tacos melted in our mouths. The only thing negative is it is a little pricey. But worth it!",

    "text": "I got to give El Segundo Sol props for having probably the best location on the Strip.  It's located in the Fashion Mall right across the new Encore and Wynn Casinos.  Excellent to just sit outside, people watch, and soak up the hustle n' bustle of the Vegas Strip.  And now for the food, service, and atmosphere: not as good as I hoped.  First of all the food itself was just mediocre; just a notch higher than the other Americanized Mexican fare.  The price was incredibly expensive for what I deemed as simple Mexican dishes.  I had the grilled chicken tostada and it resembled two small rice bowls with just enough fillers to make it look full.  There was a fair amount of chopped chicken breast meat but it was pretty bland.  Price for this dish cost $14.99.  Okay I understand that the restaurant is in prime location but paying that kind of price for food that's one notch up from Acapulco's wasn't exactly what I had in mind.  Plus there was no complementary chips n' salsa like any other Mexican restaurants that I've been to.  If you want table-side chips n' salsa, you would have to pay for that.  Service was just okay but not overall attentive.  When we entered the restaurant, there was not host/hostess at the front.  A bunch of us milled around for a bit until the hostess finally noticed that we were waiting to be seated.  Our server did take our order after nearly 10 minutes of waiting and only checked on us once during our meal and that was not including bringing us our bill.  The atmosphere can't be beat.  The location was amazing and you have your choice of whether to sit inside or at the outside patio (which I highly recommend).  It was nicely decorated with a fiesta-like ambiance.  Other than that, I'm pretty sure there are better choices for a quick bite.",

Service was pretty mediocre, with the server not really seeming to want to be there and just an overall feeling of 'slow' from everyone including the manager on duty.   The Happy Hour Prices are good enough, but the food is bland and not really very exciting. I know that you can't exactly expect too much from Mexican Style\" Happy Hour done on a corporate scale.. but you can hope.  My hopes were crushed. My dreams have changed...lol. I now stick the old favorites where I get the authentic stuff.   I am not anticipating a trip back to El Segundo.. but if I ever get back there, I  hope it is a better experience! Happy Eating!",

The food is very good, although not particularly special. Same for the drinks. Maybe it's because I've never been for happy hour, to experience the specials, but for the prices I wanted more... more flavor, bigger margarita, chips and salsas on the table...   We ordered the queso fundito, which is my less preferred option to queso dip, but it was tasty with nice hints of roasted peppers in it. Then I had the shrimp fajitas, and my friend has the steak/chicken fajitas combo. Service was good, but not standout.  I loved Cafe Ba Ba Reeba that lived here before, and I don't think El Segundo Sol has quite filled those shoes.",

My husband and I were staying at Wynn and walked across the street to find some less expensive and more casual fare. We came across El Segundo and decided to give it a try. First of all, they have a sign at the podium stating that if you text \"sol\" to a certain number, you can receive free food. I did so, and was instantly rewarded free chips with a trio of salsas! They were great chips and all the salsas were fresh and tasty. It was a huge portion, too. Then we shared the steak fajitas, and they were delicious. The veggies even included grilled asparagus, which was awesome. The meat was well seasoned and marinated. I'd definitely go back for the food.  The server, however, was a little spaced out. He brought us both the wrong drink, took FOREVER to being the check, and then had forgotten to comp the chips. He did so without question, but it was just a little annoying to have to remind him at that point, since we had been waiting so long. (I served at restaurants for 4 years so I have a very high tolerance for issues and much respect for wait staff, too.)  But, overall, a good experience. Will return next time we are in Vegas.",

My other half enjoyed the carne asada tacos and I had the gluten free chicken enchiladas. We are from California, we both grew up on Mexican food and we were both wowed. My other half loved the corn tortillas, the seasoning on the carne and the cilantro-lime rice. I loved the enchiladas, the tinga chicken was super moist and the cream sauce was perfect. Our waitress was very nice, and very attentive. We walked out planning to make our last meal here as well.  On our way home we stopped and grabbed lunch on Monday. We ordered the chips & salsa but no drinks before the long drive. He had the braised beef crispy tacos and I had the gluten free braised pork tacos.

The corn tortillas are really little and served in a cup but don't let the size fool you. Truly the best flavor I've ever tasted. My husband the tres enchiladas and they were excellent. This vegetarian tried a bite of his cheese  enchilada and the authentic cheese flavor was incredible. He said his enchiladas were excellent and full of flavor! Back to me... my vegetables (red & green bell pepper, zucchini, corn, roasted cherry tomatoes) were done perfectly and it was served with the best black beans and lime rice. The cilantro on the plate was generous and the entire sprigs were on there and I loved that! I could cut and slice away and build my tacos to perfection!   Now the funny part... I would be remiss if I didn't tell you about our incredible waiter Jose. He's been here for 5 years, loves his job and has the warmest smile that is a mile wide! I stopped him to tell him some bad news about an item on my plate. In a little cup there was green stuff which looked very much like a smooth guacamole! I tasted and was horrified as it was pure lime! (I love lime but not like that) Like lime and grass combined. I stopped him and he leaned in close while I gently tried to tell him with the sweetest smile on my face that it was the worst guacamole I've ever had! He started laughing so hard. He's laughing and letting me know that it's NOT guacamole! It's called oja santa sauce and made from a leaf of a plant! I was so relieved because how could a restaurant with this good of food butcher guacamole?!?! He said over 5 years that almost always people leave it untouched. It's supposed to substitute sour cream. I told him to tell management they are wasting their money and that I understand the reason for it as it is really fine food but maybe put it as by request only for those who love it.   The finale: the FLAN!  I have to tell you that my husband orders it at every single Mexican food restaurant we go to. It was amazing!!!! It was like creme brulee! Eat here!!! Ask for Jose to be your waiter!",

Shared the Ensalada Picante and chicken quesadilla.  Salad was citrusy, a little salty and full of tasty little bits.  Quesadilla was crispy on the outside and melty cheesy goodness on the inside.  Service was friendly and efficient.  My iced tea was always full.  I'm sure the next time we visit Las Vegas we'll visit El Segundo Sol again.",

    "text": "Huge fan of this place which is within walking distance from the Trump on the corner of Fashion Show mall. Lots of outdoor seating (with heaters right now!) and indoor space, right on the strip so good for people-watching.  I went down for a quick lunch the other day, and it was so good I doubled back a second time for dinner with the hub in tow - he totally agreed!  The guacamole, which they can do spicy or super spicy (go for the super) is great, and there's LOTS of it for the price, fabulous value at $10! Comes with a baking sheet of crispy tortillas that almost resemble fritos in taste, really unusual and really good. Comes with 2 bowls of salsa - all this is easily enough for an appetizer for 3-4 people, or a lunch with leftovers for 1! For an additional $3.95, they'll give you bottomless chips and salsa.  Today we had the mahi mahi tacos, which was not a good value for $18.95 and a portion of fish about the size of 4 fingers, but it was decidedly delicious nonetheless. Comes with very flavorful white rice, black beans, pico de gallo, slaw, and a couple of little sauces.  Their margaritas are awesome, as is their sangria, which is homemade. This will be a go-to for fast, delicious bites - and it's right next door to another great joint, Stripburger! A definite be-back!",

Our waitress Jessica was beyond helpful, she went beyond her service to make us feel welcome with all the kids. Thank you so much Jessica. The food, OMG LET ME JUST SAY THE KIDS ORDER MORE. I love the chicken enchiladas. I usually just like moms enchiladas homemade, but El Segundo Sol even met moms expectations. The kids wanted to eat there again.

    "text": "******* 3.5 stars *******  I stopped here last night with a coupon from the parent company Lettuce Entertain You.  I sat on the patio.  It was very pleasant with all the LP heaters around and it was fun watching the tourists walking on the Strip.  I started with a bowl of tortilla soup.  It was quite good and the service was different.  The bowl was placed on the table.  In it were tortilla strips, avocado cubes, some cilantro, queso fresco, and some pasilla chilis.  The server then poured the soup from a pitcher over the \"dry\" ingredients in the bowl.  The soup had a very nice flavor and was a good start to the meal.  The main dish was the carne asada tacos.  The server had asked how I wanted the steak cooked and it came out rare as ordered.  There were rice, beans, and the steak slices with 5 small soft tacos standing in a metal container.  The beef was good, but the rice and beans were a little bland.  Nothing a little Tapatio couldn't help!    For dessert, I got the chocolate layer cake.  It was a circular chocolate layer cake coated in chocolate with some freshly made whipped cream.  Excellent!  You can tell from my photo that I didn't care for it at all.  I almost asked for a clean straw so I could snort the remaining crumbs.  Summary:  The meal was good but it is pricey and not somewhere I'd go without some coupon.  I give it an extra 1/2 star because my server, Tiffany, was absolutely top notch.  Pleasant, friendly, and attentive are good descriptors.  After eating 4 times in the last two weeks at Lettuce Entertain You restaurants in Las Vegas, she was the only person who asked if I was a member of their frequent diners' club.  I was not but I am now thanks to her.  Her level of service kicks my rating up.",

    "text": "If there's one cuisine you shouldn't eat on the Strip, it's probably Mexican. You can typically find better and cheaper off the Strip, no doubt. But, I didn't listen to my own advice and stopped by this place, located on the ground floor of Fashion Show mall, across from the Wynn.  There's a bar and patio street side for people watching and a darker, more cozy dining area inside. The food was slightly better than expected, but with the same hefty price tag of our casual Strip eateries. The freshly made guacamole was perfectly seasoned and well balanced with just enough acidity. The freshly fried tortillas chips were a welcome bonus, too. The pork taco platter consisted of succulent chunks of pork (that were too oily for their own good) in a skillet and some accompanying ingredients next to it for you to build your own tacos. The five tortillas they give you are plenty. The rice and beans were nothing special. But, you can basically say that about the majority of Mexican restaurants in town.  There's a kid's menu with typical kid-friendly fare. I will say that their cheese quesadilla was excellent. I'm not sure how they get their tortillas to be so delicate and crispy (almost like wonton wrappers) but they make for some of the best quesadillas a kid will eat. And, my kid is an expert at eating them.  As long as you go in knowing you'll spend a lot, you will probably leave satisfied. The food is typical Mexican that doesn't break any new ground, but is good enough to hold it's own against similar Mexican spots on the Strip.  3.5 Stars",

I enjoyed the quesadillas the most- and do you wanna know why?! Because they came with guac, pico de gallo and sour cream, and the pico de gallo was actually DELICIOUS. We also tried the fish and lobster tacos. I'm a fan of the fish although my friend preferred the lobster.

    "text": "The Skinny: tex-mex food - the tacos are a-ok but skip on the fajitas (3) service: highly variable, depends highly on your server (3) value: it can be okay if you have a coupon (from the parent company, Lettuce Entertain You) but is expensive for what it is full price (3)  When we walked in, I thought - oh-oh, another overpriced Strip restaurant catering to the masses. The fact this place shares a kitchen with Stripburger also did not make me excited about this place.  But frankly, in the end, we were pleasantly surprised by the decent quality of the food here.  After two visits, we have tried their steak fajitas, two types of fish tacos, carnitas tacos, a salad and their bottomless chips/salsa.   The bottomless tray of hot chips ($2.95) were nice...but nothing outstanding. Depending on the time we went, the pico de gallo could taste a little over marinated (lunch was better than dinner). The roasted tomato and the salsa verde were both only okay in my books - really lacking that nice subtle heat and flavour of a really fresh salsa. Given the timing of the main entrees (which tends to take a while), this order can be a godsend if you're hungry.  The carnitas ($14.95) and fish tacos were pretty solid renditions. The carnitas were slightly sweet, smoky and lightly dressed. Combined with the beans, it was a nice combination. The fish taco were good in both the fried ($15.95) and grilled ($17.95)  rendition. (Of note: the grilled version was not dry which is hard to find but the serving size is smaller than the fried version) The accompanying cilantro rice is definitely on the drier side I would probably pass on those carbs.  I would have to unfortunately comment that the fajitas are a monumental fail. The cast iron skillet that it was served upon scorched the poor veggies into oblivion. As they say, \"no es bueno\".  The chipotle Caesar salad ($5.95) was also disappointing. The creamy chipotle dressing was too heavy, overly smoky and needed much more acidity. It's seemed also a rather poor portion size with scant condiments given that you're paying $6 for it. I kind of expected more pumpkin seeds than I can count on one hand. So pass on this one too.   The tres leches is only okay in my books. It comes literally swimming in a large bowl of milk = soggy cake. If they toned down the milk significantly, the texture would definitely benefit a lot.  Service can be really hit or miss depending on the time you go and on the server you get. We've had some really good servers but some really slow ones as well. Lunch and weekdays (of course!) are the better times to hit this place.  FYI - I would probably skip the tableside gucamole. Watching the gucamole station made me leery because 1) how can it be good when some random person is making the gucamole, 2) the person making it isn't tasting it to make sure it tastes good and 3) there is no handwashing station close by. You have been warned!!!  Overall for the Strip, this place is not bad but it isn't great either. If you are a Lettuce Entertain You Member and get coupons in the mail, it can an affordable place. 3 starred review.",

Guacamole is awesome and takes some determination to finish with just two people but you can do it!  We ordered medium spice but there wasn't much kick to it.  If you want spicy I'd tell them extra spicy.  YOLO.    Steak and fish fajitas were recommended over the chicken by the waiter and they were both pretty tasty.  Steak was very juicy.  The flavor leans a lot on the pico, salsa and guac.  Minus one star for a few small things.  The food was not too exceptional in any aspect other perhaps portion size, music made our ears bleed (just a little bit), and service was a bit on the slow side.  These could be pluses for others depending on what you're looking for.",

    "text": "I'm a fan solely because of the tableside guacamole and the drinks. I vowed to come only for that after eating here on my birthday one year.   The entrees were alright, but they were bland. That seriously sums it up. I had the spicy ground beef mexican pizza. Bland. No spice. Not even any beef flavor. I sampled someone else's chicken fajitas. Bland. Carne Asada tacos? You guessed it, bland! It was almost like they ran out of salt, pepper, and all other herbs and spices in the kitchen that night. The tortilla on the mexican pizza was dry and the top layer flaked away completely, leaving only the middle layer stuck to everything else. The only reason I stated that the food was alright and not terrible was because it was all cooked well (minus the tortilla on the mexican pizza, it was like licking the arm of the guy from Tales from the Crypt...)  Back to the tableside guacamole, it's fresh, smooth, and citrus-y. I loved it so much that I started making it at home occasionally. The head chef posted his recipe in VegasSeven Magazine one year and I've been hooked. The sangria and cocktails just bring the whole experience together.  Like RA sushi, this place is LOUD! Don't come for conversation with a date or long lost relatives...come to eat and drink and look at their pretty faces while listening to music being hammered out overhead. Otherwise, you'll spend the night incorrectly lip reading instead.",

Sometimes they can put an overdose of lime juice in it, but the portion is large and the avocado is fresh (no avocado pulp used)!    I enjoy coming here for brunch on the weekends and ordering the huevos rancheros, but on one occasion the dish was served cold.  The ambiance of the restaurant is exciting - sits on the corner of LV BLVD - great for people watching.    If you're looking for good drinks, people watching, and satisfying guacamole, I recommend coming here.  Looking for good sauces and a full course meal?  Go to Javier's at ARIA.",

My guy pal said it was the best hes had in Las Vegas and he grew up with homemade guac.  They can make it mild, medium or spicy also, which is something I've never came by.  For dinner, I had the jumbo shrimp fajitas, which came with a side of sour cream, salsa, pico de gallo, and black beans & rice. In the skillet they had char-grilled corn, asparagus, white onions, cherry tomatoes & red peppers.  Dessert was recommended by our server: Coconut flan! It was smooth & creamy in texture and the coconut flavor made it all the more perfect. I do have to say, do not get the sangria, I thought it was the worst I've ever had, but the flan made up for it so there.  Our server was Marisole who I recommend to request if you ever stop in; she's a sweetheart.  Sidenote: This place is also a sister restaurant of mon ami gabi, eiffel town, strip burger, joe's seafood, where you can get a frequent diner club card for points and discounts.",

Also, the handicap access is (illegally mind you) blocked by tables which render it difficult  if not impossible for customers with accessibility issues to access the restaurant. It's absolutely ridiculous. When we spoke to the manager, she replied that it was the design of the building and they would clear it every time.

Order the ELOTE is a must it's a bit on the spicy side thou so watch out if you don't want chili powder you have to ask them . Tres leches cake with dulce de leches yum !  Salsa music in the background very great Mexican bar ambiance .  Food is kind of pricey but you pay for experience on the strip .",

To make matters worse they sat us right next to two very drunk people, then the very intoxicated man began to projectile vomit on my mother, we had to move and the staff didn't care. At no point during the meal did anyone apologize or talk to us about what happened, the food was also horrible. However, if you're kinky and like to be thrown up on this is the perfect place for you.",

WHAT I ORDERED: * vegan fajitas (no meat/dairy) * shared guacamole for the table   PROS + great location + fun, social atmosphere & environment  + lively music  + friendly, attentive staff   CONS - very bland flavors (maybe they thought vegan = flavorless?) - parking isn't super convenient since you park in Fashion Show Mall's underground lot  Overall, it's decent if you're already on the strip but for most locals, there are better places to venture out to.",

    "text": "Had a very pleasant dinner at El Segundo Sol last night.  Choosing a restaurant in Vegas is tough, especially if you're not looking for anything fancy, or not wanting to spend a fortune.  We figured Mexican food might be a good option in terms of a laid back vibe.  Walking up to El Segundo, we passed quite a few other restaurants at the mall, all of which were pretty quiet, so I figured maybe El Segundo would be quite as well.  Nope!  The outdoor area was packed and lively.  We chose to sit indoors where it would be a bit quieter, which was fine.  We started with margaritas, going with the last one on the list, can't remember what it was called, but it was good.  I had the mahi tacos and my coworker had the chicken fajitas.  His fajitas looked really nice and I was very pleased with my tacos.  What I liked about the tacos was that they were not pre-assembled.  they came with a nice piece of fish and all the fixings and then you made them as you liked.  It was a great choice for dinner and I'd definitely return.",

We were greeted by friendly hostesses and asked if we wanted to be seated outside or inside. We chose outside and we were seated at a table with good people watching as it was next to a busy walkway. We were handed menus and our beverage order was taken. It wasn't too long before our beverages consisting of iced water, iced tea and two Coke's were brought to our table. Our waiter was very friendly, efficient and attentive. We ordered our meals of chicken tacos, chicken quesadillas, mahi tacos and shrimp tacos were brought out with beans and rice.  Everything was fresh, tasty and delicious. The corn tacos were served separately from the chicken and fish so we could build our own. Two sauces were served with our meals.  Our waiter brought me out a personal coconut flan with a lot Birthday candle in it. It was really cool. We enjoyed our meals and we all became very full. It was a perfect ending to a long workday for me.",

I ordered the chicken fajitas and whatever the larger size of Dos Equis was and it was absolutely delicious.  Second Visit: Party of two, just my girlfriend and I, and the service was absolutely horrendous. Sat down and ordered a beer and she ordered a sprite, took over 30 minutes for either of us to get our drinks and that was only after we asked the waitress twice to check on them. Our chips were empty after the first basket and never filled again until our food came out. Girlfriend's food looked good and normal portion size, I ordered chicken fajitas again and it was literally a platter of veggies with maybe 4 small bites of chicken so it was a total ripoff. Hopefully our future experiences with this restaurant are more like the first and not the second!",

I was in the mood for a beer and almost went that route, but made a game-time decision to do a margarita instead. Our server offered us the small \"taster\" sized drinks so we could try a few, which was a good call. I had both the aperol margarita and the prickly pear margarita; both were good, but I lean slightly toward preferring the aperol. Side note: when we left, we asked for a final margarita for the road, same size, and our server definitely gave us a larger one to go (for the same price). She knew the way to our hearts!   My friend and I both ordered tacos; I had the vegetable ones. They're build-your-own, so you get a plate of roasted veggies (tomato, zucchini, asparagus - none of that boring peppers & onions nonsense), 4-5 little corn tortillas, and some sauces on the side. Rice and beans complete the plate, and it was all delicious. I had worried that the amount of tacos would be WAY too high, but since they were on the smaller side, it was just right.   Patio seating was lovely as well. :)",

Then it was pretty damn good the second time when I got the steak plate and the guacamole was bomb as well as the chips and salsa then bam the tres leches had me sold.   Went back a few more times after that with different people and we began to notice the quality of the food was never consistent.   It was the last time that made us realize we're not going back. We went for a birthday dinner and the waitress took forever to come by and it wasn't that packed. Got the order wrong and the food was just mediocre... low key embarrassed we told people this place was good because you can tell they didn't like the food either.   Don't want to give it 0 stars because of that one time it was on point but it can't justify giving them a 4 or 5.   Food and service CAN be good but they just need to be more consistent especially because it's not that cheap.   Let me know when y'all get it together @Segundo Sol ",

Our server Anthony was simply stellar with our drinks being quickly replenished, order promptly taken and frequent check-in's to be sure we were not in need of anything. The managers Suzanne, Mark and Marcel each stopped by to say Hi and to be sure we were being taken care, a welcome change from some other spots that we've experienced on the strip where you rarely see your server let alone a manager.   Our party ordered a chicken quesadilla, happy hour tacos, and we had a combo of chicken and steak fajitas. Also had ordered salsa and chips with guacamole, which was the BEST and so flavorful.  It's is a nice atmosphere with authentic foods, variety of flavors and options galore to choose from. It has an upscale cantina feel and for a brief moment you forget you are on the Las Vegas Strip. Finally the option to select from the many MANY tequilas is the perfect final touch to our night. One member of our party travels the world as an airline pilot and is a naval service retiree who commented that his meal was one of the best he's EVER had in terms of authentic Mexican cuisine. He has been EVERYWHERE they noted.   If you want a fun, casual, affordable night make this a must visit dining spot for lunch or dinner.",

At one point I was eating my veggie fajitas and took a bite of what unknowingly was one of two large \"ghost peppers\" thrown on my plate. Thinking it was a mini bell pepper I took a big bite and I instantly was ill; sweating, mouth and facing tingling, shaking and mouth on fire. I ran to the restroom and vomited a few times. I came back and sat at my table and tried to wave the waiter down to no avail. I got attention of the guy at the bar and he got the waiter to bring me some milk. The waiter laughed and said, \"oh yeah, those at ghost peppers and are really really hot\". I asked why they weren't listed on the menu or warned about and he said it was a \"surprise!\" The night out with my husband was ruined and I had to go back home miserable and out the cost our meal.",

    "text": "So first off, order their guacamole and queso fundido right now. The queso is very different than most places, it's not a bowl of melted liquid cheese, it's a skillet of cheese that is melted down with either spicy beef or chorizo on top (both options are delicious- if you don't like spice then the chorizo isn't spicy at all I didn't think) and then you put it on a chip or roll it up in warm corn tortillas they bring. The carne asada tacos are my fave taco probably because the meat is perfectly cooked and very flavorful. If you go here, definitely go at happy hour (daily from 4-7 pm) because in comparison to normal Vegas prices they are basically giving food and drinks away here! During HH, tacos are $3, drinks are $4 or $5, and even an entire pitcher of sangria was only $15. See? Basically free when normally one drink in Vegas is $18. And the service was great. Our waiter in particular was so  nice and accommodating and multiple people came up to check on us. I come to Vegas often for work and have stayed at the Wynn a few times which is right across the street, so this place is a lunch staple when I'm in town.",

The majority of the restaurant is outside and it was a nice day, so it was a no-brainer.  Our waiter extolled the virtues of the Guacamole (Del Rey Farms Avocado, Tortilla Chips, Salsa), so we ordered that and the Beef Quesadilla (Mexican Slow-Braised Beef).  The guac arrived shortly after and it was an *enormous* amount. It came in this gigantic stone bowl and was accompanied by an extremely generous helping of nachos. This is definitely one of the better variations on guacamole I've had as of late, with its big chunks of avocado and zesty seasoning. (It also contained a few pieces of what looked and tasted like orange, which seemed weird but actually worked really well.)  The quesadilla is quite tasty, too, with the rich, beefy flavor managing to come through with almost every bite. The complimentary chips and salsa were fantastic, as well.  (I should note that we returned a few days later for happy hour, and the amazingly low prices aren't a reflection of the top-quality food.)",

    "text": "El Segundo Sol is a new Mexican restaurant that just opened up this week at the Fashion Show Mall (it's located in the old cafe babareeba location).  I visited the restaurant on Friday night and left pretty pleased.  Notwithstanding the \"new opening\" hiccups that our party experienced, I recommend that you check this place out!  Minus one star for not providing chips and salsa (you can purchase it for around 3 dollars but the salsas are nothing to write home about...they're all pretty bland).  However, if you're with a group, try the queso dip, it is amazing!!  It comes with small, in-house made corn tortillas.  So yum!  The drink selection is great.  I had a tableside margarita on the rocks and I was able to select my choice of tequila.  The server also had no problems customizing margarita orders.  And they offer a great and long selection of beers on tap.  On to the food!  I ordered the tacos al pastor and they were delicious!  The shredded pork arrived in a little covered black pot alongside rice, black beans and guacamole/sour cream.  And it was served with more of the homemade corn tortillas.  So, it became a make your own tacos platter.  I highly recommend ordering the al pastor.  A friend ordered the chicken enchiladas and they were wonderful!  I didn't try the carne asada entree but it arrived on an enormous plate and looked fantastic.  One side note: the rice is a little odd for a Mexican restaurant...it had an aroma almost like jasmine rice and it was very sticky like short grain rice.  It tasted alright, it just took some getting used to.  Minus one more star for the prices.  They're pretty steep compared to other Mexican restaurants I've frequented, but then again, the restaurant's located on the strip so it's understandable.  The decor is great, especially if you sit outside under the trees (strung with twinkle lights!).  If you're craving Mexican, try this place out.",

The guacamole was fresh and tasty, and you can order it mild, medium or spicy.  We ordered medium and it had a pretty good kick.  But it sat on our table for a good ten minutes while we waited for the chips and salsa, which were also very good.  We ordered a cheese crisp, which was very good, and the nightly taco platter special, which was the tenderloin.  The steak was marinated and cooked nicely but it was a very spartan taco with nothing else going on but some slices of steak and some small corn tortillas standing up in a metal cylinder, with rice and beans.  Again, the wait time was terrible, probably 30 minutes from the time we ordered the entres.  It was a Saturday night but the restaurant wasn't that busy so really can't understand what took so long.",

    "text": "I enjoy good food and good happy hour specials, and El Segundo has them both. I have gone to eat here several times, mostly for happy hour, and have only been just a little bit disappointed. Just a smidge.  Happy Hour: Truly one of the best on the strip. GREAT food selection (go straight to the chicken, pork or beef tacos, DO NOT PASS GO), margaritas are delicious, not too sweet, not bland or watered down with mix. Service is good each time we go to El Segundo. We love the nachos, not too much cheese, love the jalepenos for that extra kick without being too aggressive. GET THE CRAB TOSTADA. REAL crab, not heavy on the mayo or dressing, PERFECT. YUM. NOW. HH gives you food in the perrfect size. It is a great HH, and perfect for a few quick bites to refuel while running amock on the strip.  Inside Restaurant: Now here is where my desire to give only three stars comes into play. Since I was so used to the delicious street tacos and nacos and oh yes, that crab tostada I was a little displeased with the restaurant fare. I strongly dislike, borderline HATE overcooked food. I've done it before, but that was in the privacy of my own home and rarely at a restaurant. The shrimp was VERY overcooked. Disappointed, especially since the shrimp were plump and looked delicious sitting on the fajita plate. Maybe it sat for too long? Heat lamp cooking? I got my way through it by smothering the shrimp with their DELICIOUS cilantro rice (seriously, I could have eaten a copious amount of that rice) and beans. However, the next time I came back and had the chicken tacos? SAME THING. DRY. Oh, I just don't think that dry chicken should ever be served to a table. If someone could say the food on their plate is dry, DO NOT SERVE IT. Even by looking at it I could see that it was dry.  However, between their killer happy hour and their AMAZING AMAZING AMAZINGA tableside guacamole, I'm confident in the 4 stars here. Go for HH, get some guacamole, chips and salsa, nachos with chicken, crab tostada and some street tacos and you'll be good to go until later that night when you're struggling to hold down the contents of your stomach after one too many Hurricanes.",

I told our server and she had them make me another one (which was nice) without the peppers.( and without giving any dirty looks)  She failed to tell me the were \"fresno red chili peppers\" which are among the spiciest they serve in the restaurant -___- Okay well lesson learned.

    "text": "GLORIA, GLORIA, GLORIA!!! So, the previous night a few of us went to STK and the service that Gloria provided was by far above and beyond what we had experienced the night before.  She was attentive, colorful and made an AWESOME guacamole.  Having owned several restaurants coast to coast you get a good feel of what people can turn into and she definitely will be in a management role the way she is going.  If you end up at El Segundo please ask for her, to guarantee, that you will receive top notch service.   As for the food, well, there's some need for improvement.  I understand that this a chain on the strip, and everything is measured, but when I order TACOS I want my meat over flowing.  I don't want some anorexic looking taco! I had three different types and I wouldn't order them again. Don't get me wrong, they had good flavor, but don't be cheap with the meat. Drinks were priced competitively, $5 Shots of Cazadores, $3 beers and I forget the rest because I had one too many shots! Anyhow, I thought it was a nice gesture that Gloria introduced us to the General Manager who in turn bought us a round of shots.  Usually, its the girls who get the FREE drinks, so we were happy that we finally got a hook up! The pour cost for the 3 shots is probably 70-90 cents each, so even though they ended up losing $2.70 at most, because of their generosity we will definitely be back to spend some more $$$ the next time we are in Vegas.   Great service, great happy hour special!!",

There was a girl up front with a huge basket of avocados and salsa making fresh guacamole all night!   I think our server's name was Alfonso, who was awesome!  Our appetizers and dinner all came out at once, but we didn't really mind at all.  Alfonso apologized but we let him know that it was totally fine... seriously no bid deal.  Shortly after we started digging in, the manager (with a little earpiece wire) came by our table to check how things were.  We said GREAT so far!  Everything was DELICIOUS! Then I heard Alfonso whisper to his manager that our apps came out the same time from the kitchen.  The manager swung back around and apologized about what happened and said he's going to take off the apps from our bill!!!!!!!!!!!  We didn't even complain and they took care of $20 off our bill, even though they really didn't have to!!!  They really cared about our experience! Then Alfonso was walking by as my colleague said, \"I'm cold! I just want some coffee!\" and before we can even flag him down to put in her request, he brought her a cup of hot coffee!!!!  We didn't even realize he overheard her!  Amazing.  I'm sure he'll be a super successful businessman with that kind of attentive service!  The pulled pork tacos were sooo delicious and came with some herb buttery rice and black beans...mmmm so perfect.   The chipotle salad, taquitos, fish tacos and beef fajitas were all AWESOME! And the FLAN...wow.  Rich, creamy and perrrrfect.  The prices were decent for Vegas and I will definitely be back next time I'm in LV!",

    "text": "Up front, I don't think I would revisit El Segundo Sol.  The food was OK.  The chips were quite hearty, served warm with a variety of salsas.  I got the chicken salad which was tasty although there truly wasn't a lot of chicken on it and what was there was a little charred.  My husband and daughter didn't want rice and beans so they ordered the street tacos (on the bar menu).  They enjoyed them but they are small and at $3/each that adds up.  My son ordered the mahi tacos and his meal was probably the best of the bunch.  It was a $20 plate but he had fixings for five tacos and he actually ate the rice/beans.  My husband and I split a \"meh\" frozen margarita, e.g., not enough tequila to balance the sweetness.  Finally, I got a weird vibe from our waitress.  I asked her several menu questions (what's in the salad, can you order items a la carte, etc).  Not hard questions but I got the impression that she was irritated.  Not cool.",

As a part-time local I would GO TO THE STRIP to sit out on Ba Ba Reeba's patio (not something locals tend to do -- I just liked it that much!)  I adore the new digs -- love the trees, love the lights, a bit loud for me, but, overall a wonderful improvement.  However, I think the location could have been equally successful with all that AND had they kept the cool tapas, paella and sangria they once served.  Not the best move for \"Lettuce Entertain You\".  That said, the margaritas just might be the best on the strip.  I ordered the veggie tacos and my husband had the jumbo shrimp fajitas.  Both were VERY good; since neither were dripping in oil we felt healthy and full all at the same time.  Sadly, unless I'm in that location and desperate for Mexican food (and, trust me, you got TONS of Mexican food and margarita choices on the strip) I won't go back.  It just wasn't unique enough to get a local to drive to the strip to go there.   I'd rather have a burger at Strip Burger right next door.  Which, I guess, means \"Lettuce Entertain You\" wins anyway.  Must have been the point...",

On a Sunday evening our party had seating in the air open patio area under the trees. It was 40 degrees but they had a huge array of water misters to keep us cool. Add to that a nice flavour of energetic beats really led to a casual and fun ambiance.   I would recommend the strawberry margaritas which do contain a few fresh strawberries. I also had a quesadilla but instead of meat they let me sub it with ahi tuna. Not super amazing but a solid appy.  Others in my group had fajitas' plate, where you get a bunch of tortillas and you make your own fajitas.  I commend them on having a full assorted of sauces and toppings, which included guac, sour cream, two types of salsa (one regular, one spicy), beans and hot chilli peppers.  Another thing, it's huge. So that means rarely do you have to wait for seating.   Overall a well rounded mexican place that is low maintenance, fun and good for all ages.",

At first I thought, how good can a place be that's located at the mall. Seriously? So I brought my group with me to put this rumor to the test.  In short, we were all blown away.   Our food was fresh, flavorful and unique.  Each dish we ordered had its own El Segundo Sol flair to popular Mexican dishes. It was so good that we stuffed ourselves silly. We couldn't stop! From friendly staff and excellent customer service to delicious appetizers, drinks, meals and desserts, I would highly recommend this place.   The rumor is True- this is the best Mexican food on the strip and I'm now a lifetime fan and customer. Take a gamble, grab a drink on the patio, order a few things and enjoy this hidden LV gem.",

Kind of a more grainy corn chip than you usually see, but I really like them this way and the three salsa combo that comes with it was great.  Next was the Mahi Mahi fish tacos.  You get a piece of grilled fish and sides, and corn tortillas, and put it together yourself.  The fish was perfectly cooked which is really hard to do given that there is not a lot of fat in Mahi Mahi (which is why they usually deep fry it in pieces for fish tacos).  Tortillas were superb and the sides very tasty.  Had a couple of premier margaritas on the rocks that were great.  Attentive server. The bar speed was a bit slow'ish but not a deal breaker.  Really enjoyed a great meal.",

I just really don't like how there isn't a back entrance, so we had to walk from the parking garage and walk along the cars and around to get to the front of the mall along Las Vegas Boulevard.  Food/Drinks - We only ordered off the happy hour menu. Both of my roomies ordered the cheese quesadilla and I ordered the chicken quesadilla. We also ordered the bottomless chips and salsa! Everything was tasty and worth the happy hour prices. We also got 2 margaritas each. I got mango and prickly pear! Omg best margaritas I've had! Not too strong, just right! They got strawberry and prickly pear. I had a sip of their strawberry and it was good too!   Dining area - I really like how they have the outdoor patio with bar, and inside it looks very nice and authentic! We sat inside because there weren't anymore seating up front outside so we had a table right next to the window which was still very nice as well.   I definitely recommend this spot! I only took a star off because of the hassle to get to te restaurant itself",

Better than 3 but still made it inconvenient. When i mentuoned i just had a card he stated atm is in the mall. Keep in mind mall closes at 9... anyways, If you order guac which is delicious it does not come with chips. You'd have to order the chips and salsa separately. Chips and salsa for 5 bucks but it is bottomless. Wanted to try the elote but they ran out. The chairs were very uncomfortable, hard and small in the private party room. The steak fajitas are delicious and come with cilantro lime rice and beans plus tortillas. Wish the fajitas were a little bit bigger in portion considering the price. Also parking is inconvenient to get to this place. The food is delicious though. Because overall i had a nice time and the food was very good I'll give them 4 stars. An added bonus for me was that majority of their items are gluten free. Thank you",

So I found this place, it had okay reviews so I decided to try it.  The restaurant had good ambiance. I thought we were going to be seated outside but we were sat inside which wasn't too bad. They have a huge projection screen where they were playing some channel I cannot remember. We were also next to the bar which looked to have a great selection of Tequila.   I really wanted chicken flautas which they didn't have so I settled for crunchy chicken tacos. The server told us their sangrias were really good so I decided to try one of those too.  The sangria was actually pretty good, served with bits of green apple. That drink got me started for the night.   The crunchy chicken taco plate came with three tacos, black beans, white lime rice with cilantro, charred tomatillo salsa, guacamole, and sour cream. Put that all together and it made for a yummy meal. I feel the chicken could have had more flavor and also the menu stated they made their own shells but they looked more like the Taco Bell variety which I wasn't expecting.   A downer to this restaurant, no free chips and salsa and the food was a bit pricey for the food. We ordered one sangria, the chicken taco plate and a ceviche appetizer. The tab was $40! Not too much bang for the buck here. Many will say that's Vegas but a different dining experience totaling the same dollar amount the next evenings makes me say I beg to differ.",

Chips and salsa, guacamole, salad, chicken and beef fajitas, rice and black beans and two small deserts. There was enough to eat. I was not impressed with the beef. It was chewy to the point my jaw got tired. Overall the fajitas were not impressive. The guacamole was good however.  I'm not sure what drink option was purchased, but the private party package lists $25 per person for two hours for beer, Sangria and soft drinks and $35 per person for two hours to add well drinks and margaritas.  I would have to say the service was poor. They would bring in one course of the meal, then disappear. I arrived later than the rest and it was a struggle to get a beer. I think there were a couple people who's drinks were attended to, but the rest of us generally were ignored. And why wouldn't we be? It was in their best interest to not ask if someone would like another drink. Considering the poor service, run of the mill food and exorbitant prices, I would say this is likely to be the worst value in a restaurant I have been to.",

I ordered the cane asada tacos at $19.95.  When the plates arrived, I realized for the first time you have to assemble the tacos yourself.  The menu omits that little detail.  The asada was \"ok\" but the tacos still sucked.  Onions, and perhaps a little cheese to put on them would have been nice.  Salsa?  Well, you have to dip into the salsa for the chips for that.  I tasted the rice and beans, but didn't bother with either beyond that.  The words \"tourist trap\" come to mind.",

Also - if you want chips and salsa, they dont give them too you  - you have to order - and when you order you get a mountain full of them with great variety of salsa - but not cheap if you just want a few chips....  All in all - decent place for meal, better place for some apps and drinks.... and great service....",

I was disappointed with the street tacos, ordered the chicken and beef. The meat in the taco was seasoned very good and came with fresh veggies but what I didn't like was the taco shell holding it together. The soft taco had no taste and it seem to be a like a thin bread dough that is still raw. At least, the street tacos were small portion because bite after bite, I didn't want to eat it anymore.   What I thought was worth the value was the $5 Margaritas. I got it on the rocks,  but I was not crazy about type of tequila they used. The one appetizer that was delish were the quesadillas. It is made the way it is supposed to be with a crispy tortilla and mmmm melted cheese with grilled chicken. Not the best, but more satisfying than the street taco.  This place is conveniently located at the Fashion Show mall. This is your best bet if you want a cheap margarita and a quick bite to eat.",

Steak fajitas were really good. Totally a fan of the rice they give you with it. I think I did more picking at stuff than actual fajita assembling.   You have to pay for chips which is kind of annoying since almost every other Mexican place I've ever been to gives you them for free.

After endlessly searching on YELP for a good Mexican restaurant I came across El Segundo Sol so glad I did. To start, we order the chips and salsa best salsa Fresca I've had tangy well seasoned, then I order the guacamole which you get to choose how mild or spicy you want it, by far the best I've had as well. My wife that hates avocado was even willing to taste it and ended up loving it too. That brings me to my chicken Tinga enchiladas accompanied by black beans and cilantro rice. Wow super tender, juicy, well seasoned chicken filling and the green sauce!! amazing. My wife order the combo fajitas, steak was tender almost melt in your mouth!!! seasoned to perfection. The chicken had a charred smoky flavor that was incredible. To wash it all down I had the cucumber mint margarita which I have to say and I hate to sound redundant but again the best I've had. I will highly recommend this fantastic restaurant and will be going back.",

Given the choice, I'd opt for something else but it is conveniently located.   This is Vegas so pricing is going to be a little skewed. $19.95 for jumbo shrimp fajitas. ouch. It's a big platter with great presentation. The shrimp fajitas were light and hit the spot. The shrimp were a little too salty. The guac was great, wish they gave a bit more though. The cilantro rice was a little hard but tasty. Loved the lightly salted grilled corn. Overall, I enjoyed my entree and it was just the right amount of food.   The service was just ok. We waited an abnormally long time to have our order taken and the place was not busy. Otherwise, she was very nice.   The take-away: The fajitas were good. The prices are a little steep. You won't have a bad experience here but it won't blow you away.",

    "text": "We came here for my friend's birthday...and because of the reviews I read here on Yelp.  Unfortunately, our experience wasn't as great as a majority of those who have dined at this restaurant. There were seven of us total. Three people shared a nacho platter, one had enchiladas, one had quesadillas, one had soft tacos and I had crunchy tacos.   First, the nacho trio asked for the guacamole on the side. There was a huge pile of guacamole on the top of the nachos. But they didn't complain and just ate around it.  Second, I asked if they had crunchy tacos because I didn't see it on the menu. The waiter said no. I looked more closely at the menu...there were crunchy tacos on the menu. Weird, I thought that the waiters were supposed to know the menu at the place they're serving at.  Third, THEIR CRISPY TAC0S ARE SPICY!!! I'm really wimpy when it comes to spicy things. I can handle some heat, but whatever they put on these tacos was H0T!!! Like hot enough to at least mention on their menu or have the staff mention. I couldn't eat them. I told our waiter. It took like 20 minutes to get non-spicy tacos out to me. That was cool, everyone else was done with their meals and was watching me eat since it took so long. And why did it take so long? Because there were only like five other tables that had people at the them...they should have just gone over to the street window and have them make them for me. It probably would have been 15 minutes quicker.  Fourth, and here's when it gets messy and sort of dumb. We get our bill. Bottomless chips, check. Nachos, check. Enchiladas, check. Quesadilla, check. Soft tacos, check. Crunchy tacos + $3.95 fee for non-spicy chicken...annoying, but check. 3 sodas, check. Quesadillas, again? No, there were not two orders of quesadillas. We call over our waiter.   US: Excuse me, you charged us twice for the quesadillas.  HIM: 0h yeah, I was going to take those off.  Uh, what? Weird response...if you were going to take the second one off, then why didn't you in the first place.   Receive the new check.  Bottomless chips, check. Nachos, check. Enchiladas, check. Quesadilla, check. Crispy tacos, check. Soft tacos, check. Crispy tacos + $3.95 for non-spicy chicken. REALLY? IS THIS GUY F0R REAL? We didn't order 2 CRISPY TAC0S.  At this point, we're all just annoyed and wanted to get the eff out of there. We ended up going over to another waitress to fix the bill since our waiter was either trying to 1.) Get a bigger tip or 2.) Is incapable of being a server.   The manager came over...he was nice, as managers are supposed to be. He gave us $50 worth of gift cards for our troubles, which was a round of shots for us.   I would give this place another chance...but I would ask for a girl server next time. Good luck to whoever encounters the waiter we had...hopefully he's fully trained or finds another job soon.",

Finally grabbed the manager who acted like was going to do us a favor and he returned with a comp for chips and salsa?  Are you kidding me??? Wont return here until they learn a thing or two about customer service!!!!!!  Update 8/7/13:  I returned here after some encouragement from Ross Buter (partner/owner) and I am glad that I did!  I have changed my original review from 1 star all the way to 5 now!  They have made some outstanding changes since I had visited here.  We were immediately met with a hostess and led to our table.  We had a wonderful and pleasant waitress by the name of Adeline who immediately took our drink order, and continued to give great service throughout our meal.  We also met Ross here personally on this visit, as he was helping out in the restaurant the day we went back.  We also had a manager come over and introduce himself and speak briefly with us.  Overall, great improvements to once very lousy service.  The food has always been excellent and now the service finally matches.  Great job and we will continue to be loyal customers!",

However, since this one seemed more moderately priced and because my husband and I were staying within walking distance and we were starving, we decided to check it out.   We ate out on the patio, which was a great choice. I really liked the ambiance of it, with the lights hung overhead and the fake tree branches. And it was cool to be able to look out at the Strip (or at least what we could see of it).   I got the tacos and it was the best choice I could have made. The plate came out with every possible topping I could have wanted for tacos and everything was piping hot. The tortillas seemed fresh and tasted better than a lot of tortillas I've had. The chicken was well seasoned, and the salsa was pretty good too.   I think our waiter had been assigned too many tables though because it took forever for him to even take our order, and then to bring us our check when we were done. But, that aside, it was an experience I would definitely like to repeat!",

Yet when she dropped off the check, she came by every 3 minutes...no rush, what?  Anyway, onto the food.  I ordered the baja fish tacos with corn tortillas.  Plate came out piping hot and smelled delicious.  The fish and the taco itself with the aioli spread and pickled cabbage were flavorful and tasty; crispy batter and a tender filet of fish on the inside, texture heaven.  The rest of the plate was meh - rice and beans and the pico just seemed like after thoughts on the plate.  They should just do away with them and give you more cabbage and fish or something.  All in all, not terrible.  But I think the next time we will stick to guac and chips and alcohol.  Maybe the bar servers will be more attentive.",

The managers are always nice as well. They have quesadillas, nachos, chips& salsa and tacos on their happy hour menu. My friends and I always like to come down before we go out on the town. Great atmosphere. It's open to the strip so you can get some people watching in and the strip energy comes in. They have TVs in the bar area, so you're able to catch a game as well if that's your thing.  As for their regular menu they have delicious dishes as well. Granted, it's not at Chevy's prices but it's good quality and tastes awesome. Definitely cheaper than a lot of places on the strip! Must try the guacamole as well, it's made fresh and it's very tasty! I've always experienced excellent service as well as delicious food. I definitely recommend this place.",

Drink refills did not exist as the server didn't come around for 30 mins. The check was wrong (Included the double order), and that took 15 mins to fix. They shorted me $10 in my change and conveniently did not include a receipt. 10 mins to fix. At least this restaurant has good food and margaritas or they would get a 1 star for horrible service. The seafood platter is really good.  Be sure to count your change here though.",

The sour cream, guac and some other sauce was dripping goodness everywhere.. Mmmmm..Also had a while pitcher of sangria...yum. The waiter was ok but seemed a little amiss. $81 later I was feeling good about the dinner and drinks for 2. Then 2 days later I took my wife there for her birthday and the first waitress abandoned us for a younger guy. Then after we ordered an app and beers he served everyone around us and never came back for me to order that encore platter of fish tacos. Needless to say we left with just the apps and I think I then lost the remaining lunch money on slots. Would probably try this place one more time because those fishy tacos are calling my name.",

Are there fancier and more lavish places on the strip?  Absolutely.  But for a fun atmosphere, and a great spot for a private group reservation, I highly recommend Segundo.",

The fried chiles appy is the bomb, too, but seriously watch out for the ghost chille sitting atop the pile of green chiles. It will floor you before you know it. It almost took out my brother who pops habaneros like olives. Saved by an emergency glass of milk...

Ross is a great Partner. I have a few issues with this restaurant.  First of all Sue must be the rudest person I have ever came across in the restaurant industry. 2nd I have been coming there for 6 months and Marcel knows me and my wife and never makes an effort to even say hi or comp me a drink.  We are locals and repeat customers which is rare on the strip.  I have lived here for over 8 years and I like the food and service but my suggestion is that some people in this restaurant need to be more friendly to the customers.  I definitely come there less often then I used to because of Marcel and Sue.  As a matter of fact I have been coming there since Sue was a bartender.  BTW whenever she poured me a drink I had to do a double because she pours such a weak drink.  This review is not  to complain but rather to hope El segundo gets better employees that care about their customers like Dave and Chris. Thanks",

The endless chips with the three salsa's are a good choice as well, especially when its happy hour and your get that discounted price. The location was a huge plus, being that it is on the strip and in the mall. The street tacos that are served there as well are another plus when you are looking for something quick and good to eat.  Now as for the reason for the two stars...Food is one thing and a huge part of a good review but what hurt this resturant in my eyes was the service. We were seated quickly and that was very nice, our waiter took our order  and had our drinks to us in no time, then that was the last we seen of him. Well we seen him but he was tending to the groups of three or more. And this was not to say that the place was packed, because when we go there the bar was not even full and that was the section we were in. I seen more of the bus boys, who brought our food to us and refilled our drinks. I had to get napkins and silverware from the table next to us since the waiter did not bring our food he would not have known that we needed them. Then when we were done with our \"endless chips\" we had to flag down another waiter to bring us our refill. Later when it was time to leave since we did not feel the need to stay, the bill was rang up incorrectly. I did not understand how we got happy hour prices on the food but not the drinks..Well luckily one of the managers or at least the men in suits were around because of course the waiter was missing. They corrected the order and we got the right bill...And that explains the zero tip left to our waiter.    Overall the resturant was nice, the decor was awesome, and maybe we just got the raw end of the deal on the section that we sat in...But thats why I gave the two stars.",

Walked in and made my way to the bar where 3 bartenders were working.  I ordered the cucumber mint margarita which was very good and seemed to have a salted rim with a hint of cumin.  I usually hate cumin but this accentuated the flavor of the cocktail.  I looked at the food menu while I waited for my little lady to arrive.  She ordered the red sangria which tasted really watered down.  We found the queso fundido & two different ceviches that peaked our interest.  One bartender left on break leaving the other two tenders to service the 8 people surrounding them.  The two bartenders couldn't find the time to take our order, or ask if we needed new cocktails for our empty glasses.  I would be more compassionate if the dining room was packed or the bar was a zoo.    Over 10 minutes passed while we treaded water with empty glasses and hungry bellies.  Cant judge the food if we dont get a chance to order but the service was horrible! I didn't feel I had to beg for ordering food and drinks so we left $ on the bar for the cocktails we had.  Who knows if it was enough to cover the tab because we didn't even get a check.  I texted the same friend on the way home telling him of our poor experience and to my surprise he has since had the same experience I noted above.

They run great shifts, and know what great service is really about.  I run a profitable Italian restaurant with competetive prices as these, and hope others would say my place is as good as this!  Great job!  Cannot thank you enough, and will always bring in new business!  Kudos to the staff and management of Segundo!!!!!!",

It was really nice, the food was excellent.The five stars I gave it  has nothing to do with service, which was great, or food, which was amazing, but I gave 5 starts for the awesome bottle of water they give you to share with the table and the awesome handblown loook of glasses that took everything inme not to steal it. The outdoor seating was very cute with a tree canopy with lights kinda romantic in a casual way, the sangria was waaay too good which also helps that romance, and the prices were reasonable for the service and awesomeness of the food. I mean, I wasn't paying anyway, but the very handsome man I was with didn't complain ha ha. As much as I normally hate the strip and avoid it for all reasons, I will side step my contempt for this place any day!!",

The chips were very good so consider that as an appetizer as they are not free here.  Also the lighting makes it hard to read the menu.",

I'll miss Cafe Ba Ba Reeba's Cava Sangria and awesome tapas, but the new restaurant continues to offer tasty white and red sangria and friend peppers (my favorite tapa at Cafe BR).  We ordered table side guacamole which isn't really prepared table side.  The guacamole girl (that is how she identified herself) said there were too many tables in the way to push her preparation cart over to our table.  Her guacamole cart never moved and I'm pretty sure no guacamole is ever prepared table side.  They should rename it \"20 feet away guacamole\".  The drinks, chips and salsa were all good.  We didn't try the Mexican food, but I'm sure it's as good as typical Mexican food.  The service was great and our waitress was very competent.  I really liked the Caipirinha, which is the national drink of Brazil.  This place is no Cafe Ba Ba Reeba, but I might go back for more drinks and fried peppers.",

I didn't want to break the bank so I went to <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> prior to leaving town.  That was a great score as there were many restaurants to choose from.  In fact, the list was so plentiful I had to have the guy help me pare it down.    We selected one for El Segundo Sol, which is located in the Fashion Place Mall.  Since we were staying right across the street from there, it seemed like an obvious choice.   We had a $25 off coupon if you spend $35 or more, which isn't too hard to do in a Vegas restaurant.  It didn't restrict drinks either, which so many do.  So, we ended up spending close to $60 but then the coupon came into play and it was around $40, so not a bad deal.  The food was tasty Americanized Mexican food.  That's not a complaint at all, merely, an observation.  It was very tasty and there was plenty of it.  In fact, we got a to go box to take it back to our hotel room, there was so much of it.  We got the daily special and it was three different types of chicken dishes, a tostada, taco, and an enchilada, all very tasty.   We ordered guacamole to go with our chips and asked for the spicy, which it was and very good.  Their chips and salsa come with three types of salsas and they have no problems giving you more should you desire that.    I had a margarita with specialty tequila and it was about $9 but very good.  I only needed one.  The guy had a couple of beers which he said were also good.  The staff was very helpful and never let us run out of anything and they had a bottle of water on the table that you could refill your own water glass which I like because most places don't come back as often as I would like with the water.  At one point, the manager, Josh, I think he said his name was, came over to see how we were doing.  It was nice to be checked in on.   It was about 4:30PM on a Friday afternoon and the bar was full but there were just a few of us at the tables in the dining area.  I'm sure they were soon to get more crowded as the time went on.  This was a fun place, with great service.   We didn't want for a thing and I would definitely be back to try it again when I'm on that end of the strip.",

The people next to us ordered the beef tacos and the serving seemed to be small, with only two tortillas. In fact, the whole menu seemed pricy, $12.95 for enchiladas? I guess we are spoiled in Texas.  We weren't that hungry so we got margaritas--$8.95--but they were very flavorful and worth it. Did not pack that much of a wallop but they were still good. We ordered appetizers only--the wife got the \"tableside\" guac and it was quite good, but not made tableside. I have no complaints and would get it again. We ordered medium but I think it could have more of a kick. I got the nachos and like most of the country except Texas they came as a pile of chips with stuff scattered here and there. They were good but nothing special. With chicken it came to $12 which is a lot for a pile of chips, of which I ate only half, the half with stuff on them.   I am giving the restaurant 3.5 stars for the friendly service, the excellent margaritas, and the above average guac. The salas appears to be homemade and very tasty.",

    "text": "I really wanted to love this place, but it was one of the most disappointing experiences I've ever have ever had in a restaurant. I celebrated my birthday there with 25 people, and not only would we never go back, but we would never recommend it to anyone again, especially groups. The food was great, but the service was so bad, and the management's failure to take any responsibility at all makes this a 1-star maximum experience.  We arrived at 6:45, and almost immediately noticed that the waitress servicing our tables was woefully understaffed (she was servicing at least 6 large groups). It took 15-20 minutes just for chips and guacamole to come out, forgetting about any drinks. When we arrived, I let the waitress know that it was critical that we were out of the restaurant by 8:15 - we had an event immediately afterwards (and this is mexican food - an hour and a half is reasonable). Additionally, I let her know to take the food orders first, because that typically takes the longest.  We placed our food order at 7PM, followed shortly after by drink orders. The drinks took a half hour to 40 minutes to come out (multiple drinks were delivered to the wrong people) - I finally had to follow up with the hostess and ask what was going on, because I couldn't even find the waitress. I'm sorry, but 40 minutes to get a ginger ale doesn't fly with me - it's inexcusable.   At 7:45 I asked her to process the checks for all tables (we had 5 tables, so 5 checks) so we can make sure we are out for 8:15. At 7:50, I'm really getting nervous - not one plate of food has come out. The first plate didn't arrive till 8:05, and it took another 40 MINUTES for them to bring out the last check. The last portion of the group wasn't out until 8:50 - over a half hour late to our next event causing us precious time.  The worst part of the whole experience was that the manager refused to comp or acknowledge anything was wrong. I asked multiple times to speak to the general manager and the hostess and waitress flat out refused. The restaurant offered a meek apology and blamed the kitchen, when it was clearly not their fault (especially for drink orders).  Long story short, if you're in a big group, avoid this place like the plague.",

    "text": "Wow expensive for Mexican food.  I know, I know I was in Vegas and it should be expected.  We (my husband and I) were in Vegas for a tradeshow.  I had heard about El Segundo Sol through Yelp, <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> etc.  So we decided to check it out one day for lunch.  It was mid January but still nice out so we sat outside right by the sidewalk.  That was a mistake, we sat down and within 5 minutes, a bird pooped on my husbands arm.  No I'm not blaming the restaurant for this but it just didn't start off good.    Waitress shows up to let us know about specials and takes drink orders.  I order a special pomegranate something margarita for $10 and my husband orders a \"regular\" margarita off the menu at either $8 or $9...  She brings them and okay I'm from Wisconsin and maybe my perspective on a $8-$10 drink is different but it was like a juice glass, like a baby juice glass.  Talk about sipping, because I couldn't convince myself to pay for another at that price.    We ordered the salsa trio and guac.  Both were very tasty and plentiful.  Seemed fresh, we got to order the guac in mild, medium or hot.  I opted for medium and it did have some good flavors but not overpowering.  I didn't find the prices that bad, $4 for chips and salsa, $10 for guac because it was good, fresh, plentiful.  We both ordered the special lunch which was a trio of tacos (tuna, beef and chicken).  I think each plate was $18 and came with rice and beans.  Food was tasty but just so expensive for what was served.  Also the wait to get the food seemed to take forever. My husband was digging into his rice and beans when low and behold... he found a hair.  Sigh...  Then he had more bird poop in his water glass which he almost drank (until it was almost up to his mouth) because he is not a refined sipper like me.    I gotta hand it to him, he didn't loose his cool.  He pushed his rice and beans aside and told the waitress very discreetly.  She sent the manager over and they did compensate us for his meal, which they didn't have to do.  I thought that was pretty stand up of them.     Was the food quality good?  Yes.  Was it worth the $$, time waiting and pain in the butt?  Nope.  If anyone was dead set on going there I would tell them, get the quac, salsa and a bucket of beers.",

Talked to the female manager about someone taking our drink order because our server never came around to ask if we wanted chip/salsa or drinks other than the water they gave us. She was no help and she must have said something because our waitress came back with a bigger attitude.",

The margaritas are pricy and if I returned I would only go if it was happy hour. We tried some different margaritas and we loved them all. The small is very small, and for the price it is not a deal. The large is very large!  Because I saved this draft to finish the review, I cannot remember what we ordered food wise,but it was all good.

We were the first ones there around 11 AM and were seated promptly.  Our waitress was very friendly and constantly kept checking on us.  We ordered the following: - Fresh-made Guacamole: DELICIOUS.  We had it made medium spicy and it was so good.  They give you a good portion, enough for 3-4 people. - Bottomless Chips and Salsa: The three salsas served are delicious.  Along with the salsa comes a huge order of chips.  You will not ask for a second round.  Its enough for 3-4 people.  Must have. - Vegetarian Tacos:  The soft tacos are tiny, served with rice, brown beans, salsa, and veggies.  I loved the tacos.  I was too full from the chips, but I still managed to eat at least 3 tacos.  We were in a rush to catch a flight, so the lunch was rushed.  We didn't get to see the dessert options.  But since our conference is an annual affair, we will surely be back next time we are in Vegas.  Definitely worth a try.",

The restaurant sits open to LV Blvd and has got a great patio with a balcony of lit trees. I loved, loved, loved the design of this place.  The chips and salsa ($2.95 for bottomless!) were DELISH.  My meal, although I just got a cheese crisp, was just OK. I had looked at getting the Fajitas but they were a bit on the pricey side ($18).   They had an extensive bar menu though and you can't really go wrong with a margarita so I would recommend this place for a drink and a snack but not sure you could count on a mind-blowing meal from El Segundo.",

What a wonderful and pleasant surprise.  First let me get it out of the way, this place is pricey, entrees are around $20 and margaritas $10 and up.  But the food quality and portions more than make up for that.  We first went with the chips and salsa, you get 3 salsas, a classic pico de gallo, a green one and a spicy red.  All were fresh and delicious and the chips are the thick homemade kind that were oh so good.  We then ordered the queso fundido (with chorizo) and that thing was huge and very good.  It includes some mini handmade corn tortillas that go well with the cheese.  My husband also ordered the tortilla soup which was hearty and tasty.  I went with the shrimp and steak fajitas as my main dish and my husband had the chicken enchiladas.  I must say I typically don't care about rice but this rice is awesome, so incredibly flavorful topped off with pico de gallo.  The margaritas we had were very good too, the big stick one was yum.  This place is decorated very nice too, it almost made me think I was in the Mayan Riviera.  I also like the private tequila dining room, very nice for a large dinner party.  This is a good option for Mexican food on the strip and I would return again.",

Tacos were good, so were chips, salsa, and guacamole. The area under the trees is pretty and gives a nice shade on these hot summer days.",

You can people watch, it's lively and fun. There are candid lights hung around the trees, picturesque, similar to a cozy backyard. The inside is dark with intricate woodwork. There are two bars in the restaurant, one outside and one inside. The staff were extremely friendly, especially the server. They were very hands on and interactive even though we were a large group. Since we were a large group we ordered individually and I got to try a little bit of everything. They served the best guacamole I've ever had! It's not made tableside but it's made fresh and so flavorful. You have the option of choosing the spiciness level. I also had the steak fajitas which were good but the Shrimp tacos were superstars!!! Not to mention, the margaritas are a must-order especially if you are in a festive mood. I recommend coming here for a fun night out with friends and sitting outside on a warm summer night. If you can catch their happy hour that's even better. Ultimately, it's a little more on the pricey side but worth the celebration.",

Food was subpar, we had the steak fajitas.  The server we had was rude, but when I let the manager know he did rectify the situation.  I asked the server for the promo code (for the chips and salsa) and she told me I had to go back to the front door to find out what it was because she did not know it...but that was one of a few reasons the service was poor.  She also rushed me to make a decision.  Long story short, I would not recommend this place. Not so sure why there are so many great reviews about the food...possibly since I live in San Diego I have a higher standard for authentic Mexican food (but I should've known better lol).",

    "text": "Decided to drop into this establishment to grab a quick lunch rather than opt for the Fashion Show Mall food court. $126 later for a party of 5, I was left wondering WHY when it didn't seem that we ordered that much food.  When I checked my receipt a few hours later, I realized that the server had not only automatically charged us the \"mandatory 18% for a party of 5,\" but she did it TWICE. First, it's not that much $ and I have spent much more money on a meal for 2 at some fine restaurants around the world - BUT, I was caught off guard that a party of 5 had a mandatory service charge.  I honestly would have tipped more but the rebel in me doesn't like to be told I have to do something.  Larger parties, I totally understand. But, for 5?  I consider that tacky and wouldn't be surprised if this results in smaller tips for the servers overall.  Food was good. Above average mexican food - an elevated version of El Torito.   I will give credit to the manager who fixed the issue with the double service charge once I called to inquire (after basically implying I could have been under the influence.) Now, had I had an ounce of alcohol all week and this was not a work lunch, I probably would have laugh about it - but, it was a presumptuous remark - and somewhat insulting. She fixed it nonetheless, so thank you.  I only called because I was bored waiting for my delayed flight at the airport.  If I were busy as usual, I would have let it go and took the loss and this place could carry on with it's shady business.  Beware - I don't think I am the only person this has happened to. The waitress didn't even bat an eye.  In fact, the charges were labeled as two separate types of services so it would have been confusing and misleading to anyone. BAD BUSINESS.   Eat here if you're at Fashion Show Mall.  Eat here if you are craving Mexican food, but something better than the Chipotle inside the mall. Eat here if you're okay paying $19.99 for chicken tacos. (Note: chicken tortilla soup is AWESOME!) Eat here if you want to be forced into 36% of your total check.  Two stars for the soup. Another star added for the effort the general manager and partner put into fixing the issue. I will return for sure and hope to provide a 4-5 star rating as this place has some real potential.",

The homemade guacamole was delicious, the carne asada was okay, the steak was a bit too tough for me. I would probably try the chicken next time. But the rice and beans on the side were perfection.

On Sunday, October 28th I thought I'd try a new restaurant and watch the Golden Knights game at 5:00p. Since the World Series was on during the time that the Knights game was on, I figured I'd call ahead before driving from Summerlin to the strip to this restaurant. I called about 3:30p to verify that El Segundo Sol would be showing the Knights game since I was told by a friend that they had several TVs and two bar areas. A friendly gentlemen answered the phone and he told me that they would be showing \"both\" games and he'd see me in a bit!!  Fabulous I thought to myself! I texted my friend and she agreed to meet me down there. When I got to the restaurant a little after 5:00p, I did not see the Knights game on any TV. I asked the hostess and she replied that they were showing the World Series. I asked if maybe the bartender could change one tv and she quickly offered that I speak to the manager.  When the manager came and I explained that I drove down there to try out the restaurant and watch the Knights game and was SPECIFICALLY told on the phone at 3:30p that the game would be shown there, he did not seem to care. He simply stated they were showing the World Series. I asked if he could just change ONE tv and he said NO. He didn't really seem to care that someone on his staff told me they would have both games on. I am in management/customer service as well and I know that he could have made that situation right, had he wanted to or cared. Shame on you for not doing the right thing for a local customer!! And shame on you for not supporting your local NHL hockey team by showing the game on just ONE of several TVs. My friend and I left and will not be returning.",

Our server was GREAT! her name was Travina (sp?) very pleasant and she had NO attitude because the use of the Travel Zoo coupon/offer. she was a delight will ask for her section on our next visit~   We started with margaritas & guacamole/chips. The guac was a VERY generous portion for 2 people and tasted outta sight!!! I ordered the chicken enchiladas (2 per order) with green sauce and they were the BEST I have EVER eaten, REALLY!! the shredded chicken was still moist & the green sauce had a bit of citrus in it and wasn't overly spicy...all just devine. I would be hard pressed not to order this same item again.    No dessert as we were quite satisfied, and this was only lunch time so a walk around Fashion Show Mall for a little exercise was next on OUR menu.",

Comes with rice (savory with herbs-maybe cilantro), beans, pick de gallo, sour cream and grilled and season Asada. 5 tortilla served on the side.  Ahi tuna ceviche: 4 stars. Well done with completely cooked ahi tuna ( they were in small chunks.) with rice on the bottom, cucumbers, radish strips and ciltantro. I would have liked a little more cilantro. It came with saltine and tortilla Guacamole: 5 stars. comes in mild, medium,  hot. We got the mild because hubby doesn't like spicy. And I couldn't taste any spicy at all. They make the guacamole fresh and it tasted fresh and delicious with just a hint of lime juice.  Rated 4.5 stars for food and round up to 5 stars for the great service!!",

My wife would like to highlight the prickly pear margarita. We enjoyed the pork belly, braised pork and chipotle steak street tacos. They were all excellent, I simply preferred the steak. It had a little char on it with the sweetness of some pineapple - it was excellent. It took a while for our tacos to arrive, yet we were enjoying the drinks and beautiful evening. The chips (my preference) are a bit too hard but the three salsa's were quite good. We look forward to returning.",

I wish I caught our servers name. We sat on the patio and wow it's beautiful out there! They have the heat lamps going so you won't feel the cold dry outside air hahaha.   We started off with two margaritas. The aperol and the prickly pear. They have three different sizes. We wanted our meal to be more food centric and just got small sizes. The drinks were delish! Prickly pear is a bit sweeter for those that don't like a strong tequila taste.   For food we shared the chicken tinga nachos and the vegetarian tacos. We mentioned to our server we like things really spicy and she even brought out some habanero sauce for us. It wasn't super spicy but the flavor was sooooo good. The nachos were honestly the best I've ever had. The pickled and raw jalapeno really sold me!   The tacos were good as well. Who knew asparagus, bell peppers, and squash can work in tacos? I was reluctant but it was yummy and the portions were huge. We had MORE than enough for the two of us!   Thanks to our server for making our first night in Vegas so hospitable!",

The guacamole was my favorite I've had by far, if you can handle it, be sure to order it spicy! They give you plenty to share among 4-5 people along with a side of bottomless chips. Highly recommend this place, be sure to also come during happy hour as well! I'll be back soon!",

It's located in the fashion show mall-there's a big sign in the front.  Lots of different places to choose to eat at but glad we chose this place. The restaurant is an  indoor/outdoor open setting. Very chill and relaxed feel.  We ordered the slow cook braised pork tacos.  They were so tender and so delish. We really enjoyed it.  The tacos came with caramelized Pineapple, Guajillo Chiles, Cilantro. The mix between all the ingredients were heavenly.  They have happy hour times too if you're interested in hanging out at their bar and grabbing a few drink. They had a special where you can buy 5 beers for $45.   Nice place. Glad we picked it.",

I walked up to the stand asked the host how long the wait for 2 was. The look on her face wAs as if she didn't have time to answer my question at the moment & she barely acknowledged me because she was so concerned on counting tables or something. Then she looked straight at me and asked if I can hold because she has to seat the big party first.  I didn't ask to be seated I just asked how long the wait was.. Anyway, the food did not disappoint & the margaritas were delicious. The music made our time there more enjoyable as well. The coconut flan is to die for!",

We sat at the bar for happy hour and margaritas were around $5.50 which is great.  I ordered the frozen mango margarita and the classic, they were both good. Just the right amount of mango and tequila, not overpowering at all. They also had food on the happy hour menu, I ended up getting one order of beef tacos($3) and a beef quesadilla ($6). They were a little busy so the wait for the food was a tad bit long, but not too much.  Now be careful when it comes to the food special for happy hour. The taco is small and you only get one for the price, but is so delicious you'll end up ordering at least 3. My beef taco was very delicious and the quesadilla was good too, wish it had more meat inside.",

Last trip to Vegas, we went to Javier's at the Aria. It was good, but not good enough to warrant a return considering the many options available in Vegas.   El Segundo Sol is definitely worth a return. It's casual with indoor/outdoor seating in the Fashion Show Place Mall.  For us, one of the big deals was that they had a HUGE gluten free menu. Tons upon tons of options, which is so important. And the server knew enough about their gluten free practices to make us feel comfortable.  We started with their very good guacamole. You are able to select mild, moderate, or spicy. It comes with endless chips and salsa. Honestly, this is pretty much all I needed to eat because it was so good and I was full when it was done!  Husband and I split a combination chicken and shrimp fajita platter. It was excellent. Everything was so tasty. It was seasoned just right and all of the sides included were fresh and added to the flavor.  The waitress was great too. She was very sweet and recommended good drinks (for us the blackberry margarita was a perfect choice).  Overall fantastic choice that was a nice cheat meal for my normally very clean diet. It's always a bummer when you take a cheat meal and it ends up being not worth it. This one, DEFINITELY worth it.",

Try (and this won't be easy) to not gorge yourself on the chips and guacamole, not to mention that the salsa is pretty dang good too and the chips are hot, crispy and corny. If you have not filled yourself to the brim with guac I recommend the sweet corn tamales.  I have been looking for some of these tasty little gems for a couple of years now since my favorite place closed and these come as close as I have had. These are just stinking good.  I am full, I am happy, I wish my stomach could hold more of this goodness.  Thanks El Segundo.",

    "text": "We were in Las Vegas last week, celebrating our anniversary. Since we were staying at the Wynn right across the street, we decided to enjoy a late-night dinner at Segundo Sol. (late for us is 9:00; we usually eat at 5!)    We got a table in front of the patio.  A very friendly waitress came over promptly to take our drink order. I had a michelada in the big 32 oz. cup. K'ayum asked for a suicide (all soft drinks mixed together) and they were happy to oblige. Adriana had a prickly pear margarita. She said it was great.  For starters, we ordered the queso fundido and the grilled peppers. K'ayum ordered chicken taquitos. The queso fundido blew us away - it was amazing! It came with chips and hand-made tortillas. The grilled peppers were interesting - a plate of green peppers (and one red one) with lime and salt. They were quite tasty and not too spicy, until we got to the red one. There should be a warning label on it!    K'ayum wasn't too happy with the taquitos because they had cheese inside, so we helped him - amazing!  And from the kid's menu!   The waitress came by to check on us, and we decided we were too full to order anything else. I asked for the tequila list, and she recommended one of my favorite anejos - Reserva de la Familia - but I opted for Clase Azul (the reposado - I've only seen the anejo at one bar)  (Javier's at the Aria - $200 a shot...)  Although the food and service were both great, it was the michelada that did it for me. I came back the next morning at opening right before leaving for the airport to have one more at the bar, to see how it's made.  They put the usual: clamato, lime, pepper, worcestershire sauce - the big difference as far as I could see was cayenne pepper! So I've been making them that way at home ever since - and using my Segundo Sol cup (you get to keep the 32 oz. one...) to pretend that I'm still there!",

My favorite margaritas are the cucumber mint which is very refreshing, or the pitaya ( cactus) tangy and a little sweet.  The food and service has fallen short for me too many times.

    "text": "I'm just here to chime in about El Segundo Sol's strip-side taco \"shack\". Nestled in close to El Segundo Sol  and Stripburger (both Lettuce Entertain You Restaurants), this could have huge potential as a great place for a little (very little) snack.  These are the tiny, and very authentically sized, tacos like you find on the streets of Mexico, unfortunately they are $3 each.  They come in three flavors, beef, pork and chicken. If you want more dressing up than a little pico de gallo and a wedge of lime (which is the \"traditional\" way), it was cost you another 90-cents or so for some lettuce, onion, tomato and avocado (as I recall, I did not go for the upgrade).   What brought us in was the 2-for-1 coupons being handed out on the sidewalk. This was the only kind of card I wanted to grab, and as it turned out, it was a decent and tasty deal.  I just can't over the price of the tacos, or the beer (a bucket of mini-Coronas for twenty-plus dollars).   Other than price (it is Lost Wages after all) the tacos were quite tasty, just keep an eye out for those coupons.  PS. The Yelp map is off for this location. El Segundo Sol is at the NE corner of the Fashion Show mall (Las Vegas Blvd. S and Dio Dr.), right next door to Stripburger.  Edit: I just noticed that the \"South\" is missing from the address and edited the business info. That will probably fix the map.",

Three salsa styles: rojo, tomatillo and fresca, all of which were well made.  Frozen machine margs were the right mix of sweet, tart, cold and plenty strong (unlike most machine margs).  The margs are what took it from 4 to 5 stars.  Fish tacos with house made corn tortillas, also tops.  Great tortillas, properly cooked and spiced grilled fish, nice sides and condiments.  Cold crab mini tostada appetizers were also good.  Great service and seating options.  I'm hard pressed to complain about any part of my experience at El Segudo Sol.",

We sat in the bar so we could partake in the happy hour menu (smaller portions, 4-7p, served in the bar only). This was after the hostess was nowhere to be found. Our waitress took my friend's margarita order, walked a couple yards to the bar then brought the wrong flavor. Then we ordered \"2 chicken quesadillas & 2 chicken street tacos\". Easy! Yet, somehow, we didn't get everything we ordered. Strike 2. Strike 3? Did I see our waitress roll her eyes!? Quite frankly, we should have eaten at the Chipotle inside the Fashion Show Mall. Their food, service & guacamole are much better.",

    "text": "stopped in here yesterday late afternoon for a little happy hour treat. after we were seated in the bar by the hostess nobody came over to take our order. almost 10 - 15 minutes later the hostess came by again and asked if anyone came by for drinks and when we said no she brought somebody over. i didn't catch our waiters name but he took our drink order along with a side of chicken nachos and gave us some water. the glasses that were brought over were really warm though. no ice water was served here. i could tell my boyfriend was a little displeased. After being thirsty for an hour of mall walking i know he wanted some nice, cold water. he was pleased they had one of his favorite beers though, modelo especial. i ordered a frozen prickly pear margarita ($4.95) while Dan T. ordered his beer. Another 10 minutes went by before we got our drinks. Dan enjoyed his beer and my margarita was refreshing. A little too sweet but it is the first margarita i have had in months so i shouldn't complain. i recommend the prickly pear to the ladies and gents who prefer to not taste their alcohol. i had no idea i was getting anything. about another 10 - 15 minutes passed before we got our nachos. they didn't warn us the plate was burning hot so my hand almost melted when i touched it grabbing some nachos. OW! they weren't bad. i wish the bottom part didn't consist of 8 nachos turned one because of melted cheese. the guacamole and tomatos were not spread out, but one of each on the side. weird. i do wish they were all over and messy though. it mostly consisted of melted cheese and chicken. the meat wasn't bad, but it should have had a little more flavor to it. I don't know if i will be back. wasn't awful and disgusting, but nothing really made me say wow between the drink and the nachos. it was sunday from 4 to 5pm and the place wasn't packed at all so the fact that nobody came by for a while at first annoyed me. i had such better hopes for this place. oh well. i'll stick to dos caminos if i am over in the area.",

Showed up early for our reservation and were seated right away, definitely a plus considering that almost never happens on the strip. Staff was super nice and even though it was busy, we didn't feel rushed at all which was great. Overall an awesome experience. We'll be sure to come back again next time we're craving mexican food on date night :)",

    "text": "This place was just a waste of time & money. First of all, it's another americanized restaurant serving unoriginal \"mexican\" food. Food is alright, nothing special. Margaritas are weak. I ordered a large margarita with a double shot. When the waitress brought it out it was really small in size, and tasted like pure margarita mix. Customer service is horrible. All servers I encountered were rude.    I ordered the bottomless chips & salsa. They brought out one half empty basket of chips & 1 salsa. I politely told the waitress that I had ordered the bottomless chips with the 3 salsas. She then rolled her eyes and snatched the basket from my table and mumbled a \"sorry\". 10 minutes later, (still no chips & salsa)  a different waitress comes by and rudely drops a bowl of guacamole, and then walks away. I tried to get her attention before she walked away but she literally just dropped it and took off. Was everyone having a bad day? A few minutes later my original waitress came by and I explained to her what happened, she was half listening and looking in some other direction and just said..  \"Oh,...well ok, so you don't want the guacamole?\" \"No, I never ordered it, but I'm still waiting on my bottomless chips\" She picks up the guacamole rolls her eyes and walks away. WTF. I didn't even say it rude or anything. I said it in the sweetest voice I could. I've seen the movie \"waiting\", I was too scared to piss her off, then later find a loogie in my food. So I let it go.  I finally ordered my food and my super weak margarita. Waited for almost 25 minutes before getting my food. It wasn't even busy! There were maybe three other tables besides mine. By now my patience was wearing thin. I just wanted to eat my crappy expensive food and get out of there. I ate as quickly as possible.  I asked for my check, and again waited a pretty long while. I saw my waitress just standing there chatting with another co-worker, at this time, I've had it. So I went up to the waitress and told her I've been waiting way too long and I needed to go NOW. She handed me the check, and of course she had charged me for the guacamole. I told her...she said she'll fix it.... then she disappeared, and I had to wait 10 more minutes! I don't think I've ever spent this much time in a restaurant trying to \"get out\". I felt like a hostage. I was just sitting there on an empty table, w/ my doggy bag in my hands. Finally she got back, and I rudely snatched the receipt out of her hands and stormed out.  I can honestly say I'm never going back to that hell hole. The staff needs a serious attitude makeover. They're lucky they got two stars. 1 star for the location and 1 star for the huge and not so bad tasting quesadilla.",

We had our party in the El Medio room which was great for our loud group of 30 Aunts, Uncles and Cousins.  Our group menu  included a great beverage package (beer, white and red sangria, house margaritas, and non-alcoholic beverages) and a great Fajita dinner package (awesome starters, home made guacamole, chips, salsa, Padrone peppers and coarse salt , great tasting chipotle salad, delicious chicken and beef fajitas with all the trimmings, rice, beans, onions, tomatoes, etc., and a combo desert of flan and double layer fudge cake which was to die for).  Thank you El Segundo Sol!!  You made my sons 30th Birthday an exception dinning experience.  We would highly recommend dinning at  El Segundo Sol if you are in Las Vegas!

We had a perfectly sized private room, were able to order off the full menu (every other restaurant wanted us to pick from a $65 per person ++ fixed menu), and paying the check was a breeze. Great service and surprisingly great food-- I expected it to be your typical Mexican cuisine, but it was delicious, and moderately priced for the strip. Huge drinks menu as well, which was a winner for our group.   I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for somewhere to take a group-- and Kori is super helpful!",

I am not over exaggerating when I say we were waiting 20+ minutes for everything. 20 minutes to get water. 30 minutes to get our appetizer. 30 minutes to get our entree after our appetizer was done. 20 minutes until our server came back with the check and another 20 until he grabbed the check back for us to pay. We were there for two hours and 90% of that time was spent waiting. The food is very mediocre. For being so high priced they don't have many options. To start I had an elote which was the most bland, basic and unauthentic one I've ever had. There was barely anything on it. For my entree I had the beef enchilada. Nothing special and no stand out flavors. It wasn't terrible but the meat just tasted cold and old, like leftovers. Either they didn't serve it fresh or they just keep their beef sitting out. The atmosphere is nice on the inside and outside. Also it is not inside the fashion show mall, you have to walk outside to get to it.",

We ordered guacamole as well, but it was too spicy. Suzanne, the floor manager for the evening was very accommodating. She gave use New guacamole and even threw in some tres leche cake for my birthday!  Our waitress Erica, was pretty awesome as well. She suggested some great spots to go to for our visit. The food was really good. My friend had the Baja fish tacos and I had the chicken tacos. The tacos are cute because it's not assembled for you, you can assemble your own tacos. The tortillas were handmade and delicious. If you're looking for a friendly, fun environment, this is the place to go. Don't forget to get the giant margaritas!!! 4 ounces of alcohol",

We've eaten here over 10 times now and drive out of our way and park at the fashion island mall parking center.  Or if we're staying at the Wynn, Trump towers or Venetian we walk on over.   They have indoor/outdoor seating with a lot of bar seating and tv's. Our favorites include the typical Mexican subjects - any of their tacos and fajitas are killer good.   Check out the rewards program they have with lettuce entertain you.   This time around Z hooked us up with 5-star Service.   Thank you!",

I consider them a Mexican Bistro with a twist. Love the tacos, meat, fish, seafood were all great. The sweet corn tamales were a great surprise and delicious. Elote corn and taquitoes are also so good. Fajitas use great quality meats. The drinks are always delicious. Only warning.... sitting under the trees is dangerous cuz of bird poop.",

We had the chips and salsa and I must say the green salsa was so good as well as the red one. We also tried the beef quesadilla and the chicken taquitos. I can't say much about the taquitos since I did not try them, but the presentation was good. As for the quesadilla, that was the best beef I've ever had in any Mexican restaurant. It was extremely tender and the flavor was wonderful. I highly recommend this dish if you aren't feeling too hungry since it is actually an appetizer. The reason it is 4/5 stars is because even though the staff was really friendly, the waiter did not ask if we wanted any more water and just came to clear our table at different times. Overall, I highly recommend this place!",

Chips with 3 different salsas that all taste fresh and yummy.   Fabulous cocktails and enough other cool details to keep you here for a long time without spending a fortune. You'll be stuffed from happy hour, and ready to hit the town without hesitation. It's waaaaaay down at fashion show mall, so it can be a hike if you're not staying at that end. Get a membership with their parent company - Lettuce Entertain You. You'll get points on their app, and get more money back and just eat your way through the strip for days upon days.

They seem to be the only happy hour place that still makes blended margaritas. My favorite flavor is the mango. They offered me the white sangria and it was amazing!

A friend of mine who is confined to a wheel chair was forced to wheel through a restaurant (that definitely isn't wheelchair accessible) to the bar to show her ID because the bartender refused to come to her and accommodate her needs. TRASH PERSON. He also refused to let us start a tab, and treated us like plebeians even though we bought several drinks and tipped well. SOGGY TRASH PERSON. Not only was the bartender trash, but we also ordered food, and after they brought us the wrong order, we were forced to wait 40 minutes to get the dishes we actually ordered.   Basically, if you're looking for a horrible time, love being discriminated against for being less-able-bodied, and genuinely hate your life....El Segundo Sol is the place for you!!",

    "text": "*** DO NOT DINE AT THIS RESTAURANT***  I came here with some friends to have dinner. Get sat down and what is next to us, one extremely drunk guy and a female who is high on some kind of drug. Thinking ok yeah this is Vegas so I'll let it go for now... Well just when i think things are getting better, the guy begins throwing up projectile vomit on the ground which was splashing on at least three other tables which too were filled with guests. Then the lady falls out of her chair and passes out. The 2 managers & 4 restaurant workers rushed to her aid and then called for security. Five minutes later security arrives and tried to talk both out of not having the ambulance come check them out.. Then after he \"spoke\" to someone, the ambulance was called. Two other 5+ person parties actually moved their table on their own to somewhere else so they would not have to be near the drunk/high people.   Both managers still had no care in the world to even acknowledge anyone near these people to show any care in the world about what was going on right next to us. Then to make matters worse, the security guy comes to our table while we are eating and tells all four of us to move our table over so the medics can squeeze in and load these people onto stretchers. (Mind you, there was ample room through the main entrance to bring the stretcher in and do what they needed to do.) After both people were taken away on stretchers due to their levels of intoxication, the staff still made no meantion of apologizing about anything that went on. After all was done, my buddy had to ask the waitress for a box due to being nauseous from the throw up. The waitress' reply... \"yeah I understand, here's your box.\" Still no acknowledgement of the incident that went on less then 5 feet from us. So to bring this to an end, we paid our bill and got out of that restaurant as fast as we could. Just to add one more wonderful thing, the powdery substance they put on the floor to absorb the throwup, was still sitting in the floor 30 minutes after being thrown down   This place has no care for their customers and the managers would rather watch sports tv on the other side of the bar then to make an appearance to the paying customers who had to sit through this event. We will never step foot into this place again.   They only got a \"1\" star because it doesn't allow me to give \"0\" stars.",

I HAD to pair it with chips that came in a small cup because I just couldn't eat it plain.   The beef enchiladas came and my mom took the first bite and said \"uh oh, it's dry and bitter\". I tried it and spit it out. It was VERY bitter.  We told the waiter and he got the manager.  The manager was very nice about the situation and wanted us to give something else a try.  At this point we were very hungry and disappointed, so we said no thank you and went else where.",

Lots of tables were available, likely because it was happy hour time and it's apparently good, so the bar was packed.  1.  Chips & Salsa [$free, 4.5 stars] -- Totally and completely delicious. Wonderfully warm, thin, and not oily chips & 3 types of salsas that are worth fighting for.  2.  Guacamole [$11.95, 5.0 stars] -- served in a large and traditional molcajete bowl, a good amount -- probably 2 avocados worth.  3.  Slow-braised Pork Tacos [$16.95, 4.5 stars] -- a make-your-own taco bar, excellent carnitas, rice, and beans.  Loved.  Overall, my gf loved her Mahi Mahi Tacos, and her daughter loved the Shrimp Fajitas which made it a complete love-fest.

Had an awesome complimentary guacamole that was served in a generously sized mortar. The server who presented it even apologized for the wait, although there was none!  Tasted fresh, flavourful, authentic. I had the chipotle chicken Caesar salad, my companion had the quesadilla. She preferred my salad, quesadilla not worth anything above $5.  Cold, small and boring.  Had to ask for more salsa, more margarita as server chose to pay more attention to other tables around us, even walking by w/out acknowledging us. So inattentive, in fact, after a long wait of inactivity, I had to get up, walk over to whom I assume may have been a manager( no greeting from him to know otherwise) and asked for the check so I could pay and leave. This is when the server decided to catch us to act like we left too soon! Yet she paid no attention when we were seating at her station waiting, staring, waiting. I had to get up to get the check. So unnoticed we were, we could have walked out without any regard( or paying). It was only because I asked this guy for the check that he realized the situation. Second time here was subpar service.

That is what I found at el Segundo, and that is why I keep coming back.  Atmosphere- casual, Mexican cantina. They have a bar outside on the patio, along with plenty of seating. They have another bar inside with plenty of seating as well. Both bar are equipped with tvs that will allow you to watch the game. They accommodate large groups easily and without any complaints.  Food- the menu is the perfect size. It covers a lot of various foods, but isn't a novel. We had nachos which were huge, and also very good. The tacos were good and the chips and salsa....... Amazing. We have never had a bad experience there. I have recommended this place to a few other people, and everybody enjoys it.  Service- top notch.

I dealt with Natalie, the catering manager, and she was so helpful.  I changed our dinner time on 2 different occasions and she was more than accommodating.  We even had some special requests outside of the normal catering menu. When we arrived for dinner everything was set up and ready to go.  The food was very good, many of our guests said it was their best meal while in Vegas and the guacamole was the best they've ever had!    The service was great and friendly!!  I definitely recommend this place for group events and we will be visiting again on our next trip to Vegas!!  Thank you for making our special day go smooth!",

The fajitas came out hot and sizzling but everyone else's shrimp dishes came out ice cold. The cocktails took way too long to arrive and we had to ask for water 2 or 3 times as our pitchers were always empty but there was no one around to refill them. Don't quite understand why the service was so slow for a Saturday night when the place wasn't nearly full.",

El Segundo Sol has a laid back vibe and fantastic food. My friend, who had spent much time in Mexico, raved about the atmosphere and food. The Carne Asada is cooked to order, and is simply zsome e of the most tasty, and tender that I've had. On my second visit I sampled the Baja fish tacos and they were the best I've had. The fish melted in my mouth!   I really have no major complaints, aside from the service being slow my first visit. But on my second, I found the staff fast and attentive! Great place. Highly recommended by myself and I will certainly return.",

All you have to do is take the stairs up and you are right in front.  I love their corn too, good for vegan people if you hold the cheese.  And who doesn't love to watch the LV Strip?",

El Segundo Sol is located at the front of the Fashion Show Mall next to RA Sushi.  When we first walked it, there was a sign in the front to text a number to obtain drink and food specials. It is a scam to sign up for regular spam texts pertaining to this restaurant. We thought by texting that it would give us some sort of a discount. They should be upfront up with this instead of misleading the public.  They sat us in a booth but the service was really slow. It took them a long time to get to our table to order our food, bring out our food, and especially bring out our check. It wasn't really that busy so I wonder why they were so slow. I thought my chicken fajita platter was pretty good but overall I wasn't really impressed with the restaurant due to its service and ambiance.",

Everything we have had on the menu is good. Their gaucamole is awesome! It is also an outside bar so it is in a great location by the Fashion mall on the strip.

The fruit, frozen margaritas were so fresh and yummy, although slightly pricey; just get the 32 oz one, better bang for your buck. Definitely get the bottomless chips and salsas and ask for their hotter salsa to go with it. It was all really good. My table ordered quesadillas and tortillas soup, no complaints on the food. Also a nice atmosphere sitting on the outdoor patio. Would definitely recommend this place.",

For starters the Guacamole was tasty and not spicy since we ordered medium. The chips and salsa were plentiful and served with charred tomato salsa, roasted tomatillo salsa and pico de gallo. The margarita's were a little on the sweet side but refreshing. Our choice of entrees were the grilled Chicken Tacos served with cilantro rice, black beans, pico de gallo, sour cream and large corn or flour tortillas. The dish could be improved as the chicken was overcooked and dry.  The grilled Achiote Shrimp is made with a serrano and garlic marinade. This fajita platter is served with grilled bell peppers, onions, corn on the cobb and asparagus along with cilantro rice, black beans, sour cream, pico de gallo, salsa and warm tortillas, mini corn or flour. As with the chicken the shrimp was cooked too long and dry. Overall the food was plentiful and service was great. I would award 4 stars if the chicken and shrimp were not overcooked.",

They were 5 very small tacos each but plenty to fill us up! Everything we had here was yummy and the service was good too!",

Started with the chips and salsa (comes with 3 different salsa and all of them had a really good flavor and spice). Had the prickly pear Margarita which was perhaps a bit too sweet for my liking but otherwise good flavor. The Carne Asada tacos were great! - steak was cooked to order and tender. Good service on a quiet Tuesday afternoon. Would make the trek back down the strip for this on my next visit.",

We started with the chorizo fundido which had just the right amount of spice. Next the steak fajitas and steak tacos were amazing and fresh. Service was on point as well. We always had fresh cocktails and I felt that our server was always there when we needed him. Decent prices as well. Overall we had a great experience for our first time and we plan to be back next time we're in Vegas.",

    "text": "Wow. What a major difference from when I visited three months ago.  We were seated, with practically no wait. The hostess was kind enough to put us in tables more towards the back of the restaurant, so we could have room for our daughter's stroller.   We of course got the chips and salsa. Mango margarita, prickly pear margarita and a beer. Our friend with the mango margarita has a fresh slice of mango in his, which he devoured along with the drink. My prickly pear was almost too perfectly delicious.  Our waitress was so kind. Complete 180 of most of the servers that we have had when eating here. She went through the specials, with great description, and was patient and kind enough to re-explain things when we couldn't hear or didn't understand.   My guy ordered the enchilada special, that came with one chicken and one beef enchilada. Our friend and I both ordered the mahi mahi tacos. We asked for more green and red salsa, because they kind of skimp when they fill up their little black bowls. The pico was a little lack luster, but our 18 month old gladly ate the tomatoes and snacked on the chips....The man that dropped off our food quickly returned with generous amounts of the green and red salsa..  Our food came out, and to tell you the truth, we were all kind of shocked....in a good way.  Usually, when I have ordered their fish tacos, the fish has came out already sectioned out in individual tacos...and the flavor of the fish has been lack luster.   This time, a grilled filet of fish comes out, with about 4 or 5 tortillas to section and make your own. We were blown away how wonderful everything tasted. Everything, was just perfect....even the black beans and rice. All three of us were clean platers.   We ordered another round of drinks...which did take a while to come out.   After asking for the check, that did take a while too.... Like at least 15 minutes for her to come back with out change.",

They typically have happy hour which I always miss. I know it's a decent happy hour too. However, when ever I come I only get a Pacifico draft and guacamole.   The guac is outstanding! Made to order, which I love. The even add pineapples to their guac which is a nice twist. The beer is great and draft is a beer deal than the bottle. Same price and you get a few more ounces. I think the beers are overpriced, but it's a restaurant on the Las Vegas strip.   The bartender with a beard (I feel bad even describing someone like that, but I completely forget his name) usually serves us and always does a solid job as well!",

This spot can get crowded and loud at times, but it's a nice place. I love all the lights and decor. The service can be spotty, but the servers are mostly attentive and quick to fix any errors.  The queso, enchiladas, etc. are all above average. However, it is the tacos that really shine here. Very delectable and with an upscale feel. You may get some initial sticker shock (though, not worse than most anywhere else on the Strip), but the presentation and taste make it worth it.  And the margaritas are fantastic. Quite possibly my fav spot in Vegas for a margarita. I especially love the frozen margarita with a float of red sangria. It's the perfect summer drink.",

Honestly the food here isnt worth the time/ price, I regret going here because when you travel you want to try new, highly recommend places in the area and this just happened to be located in front of my hotel which made for a quick easy dinner.  The chicken was dry, roasted and slightly charred, the veggies charred but under cooked.  The rice was very bland. The little sauce dishes  lacking in flavor and also had way too little, Probably a teaspoon of guac, sour cream, and tomato salsa... was way too little for the amount of chicken and flour.  The drink was standard, nothing mind blowing, actually it was a little too salty and not strong enough (imo).  Overall my suggestion is to pass. There was a good lesson here... don't go just because the pace is convenient.",

I'm trying to have a good time with friends and that sad pile of nachos was too depressing to look at. I told them to take it back. I won't even get into the service it wasn't terrible, but why bother.  I'm coming to realize that  Mexican food served on the Vegas Strip does not do any one any favors. Everyone thinks Mexican food should be good, priced fairly and served in an adequate portion. Fast service and free chips and salsa are just par for the course. El Segundo Sol never scores high in any of the categories. Ever!  I heard of a happy hour and the bartender said it's only outside at Stripburger (same company) in the cold, dreary rain. She actually recommended we sit outside in the cold rain by heat lamps! What's wrong with people?",

The second time I patronised El Segundo Sol -- I immediately thought -- What is this shit?  Hostess was nowhere to be found. Literally, not on duty.   There were actually patrons this time, so I imagine the wait time is going to be three hours or something -- based on my first visit -- but, instead, I am immediately seated (once a random waiter showed up to perform the duties of the hostess).  Where is this hostess?   I browse the grossly overpriced menu items and select the carne asade entree.  I suppose I am not distinguished enough (looking) to be asked how I wanted my asada cooked, because they just cooked it however the fuck they wanted. Literally, not figuratively. Rice was crap, frijoles were crap.  The meal was mediocre -- as expected -- and, yet I have managed to get on with my life.  The hostess was there when I left, and, I initiated the farewell greeting. Pay It Forward.  The third time I patronised El Segundo Sol -- wait -- this never happened, because I am no masochist.  Two-stars because I am nice. Not recommended: don't come here. Gracias.",

They were all pretty good and none of them were way too hot. -The frozen margaritas were awesome !  -The plastic to-go cup for my frozen cocktail -Quaisadia's !  They were awesome both times   Cons -The SERVICE ! It was horrible ! First time it was our servers attitude - she was a bitch.  Second time - i sat alone waiting for someone to come by and take my drink order- I had a magazine And was on page 39 before someone came by. I was pissed !  I would of left but I was starving, hot & thirsty.  Finally she came over, didn't even apologize for my wait !  Then I waited some more .....  Bottom Line / food and drinks were good ( except the organic margarita/ it was nasty And my GF sent it back )  So if you think its worth shit service for pretty good food / then check it out.  Otherwise go to one of thousands of Other food places in Vegas / places that have both good food & great service .",

    "text": "I tried El Segundo Sol after a shopping trip at Fashion Show Mall.  My partner and I wanted to refuel and relax before heading out to gamble on the strip, and the cute outdoor patio seemed like the right spot to chill. Loved the music they play (lots of reggaeton and salsa), as well as the twinkling lights.  When we arrived, the front patio area was pretty full, but the back part was empty. Our server was courteous, and took our drink orders fairly promptly. We also ordered the bottomless chips and salsa.  A few minutes later, our server came back to let us know the wine I'd ordered was only available by the bottle, not by the glass. (I thought that was odd, since it was clearly on the menu as one of the wines available by the glass. Maybe update your menus to avoid confusion...). But cool, ordered a different wine.   We waited at least 15 minutes for our chips and salsa appetizer. It arrived right before the entrees.  That was irritating, as we were hungry, and what's the point of bottomless chips (not free btw) if they give them to you right before your meal?  The chips and salsa were actually quite tasty.   The Mexican chopped salad I ordered was not great. It was basically a cold garden salad with a few pieces of corn and beans and dry chicken. My partner's tacos weren't bad, a little salty, but decent overall.   I ordered a second glass of wine that never arrived, so I eventually canceled it before getting the check. Overall, the service was ill timed and distracted, though our server was very polite.    Would I return? Yes, but probably for happy hour or to grab light appetizers and a drink on the patio.  For a full meal, probably not.",

One cool thing was that we were seated in our own little room surrounded by all kinds of tequila. I ordered the beef quesadilla, an appetizer, and it wasn't very good. Not much cheese and the meat was difficult to chew.   Also ordered the unlimited chips and salsa and small Strawberry margarita. Margarita is good, can't taste the alcohol. Chips comes with three different salsas, medium, mild, spicy, all taste good.   One other thing was they over charged our quesadilla by $1, not sure if they hadn't updated the menu or manually typed it in wrong, but that was irritating as well.",

I had a skinny one so I can pretend I'm not getting a boat load of extra calories and it was one of the better ones that I've had.   The chips that came complementary were a little stale and although the service was ok, the food came to the table not piping hot and just average for a Mexican place.",

    "text": "I posted a review awhile ago and was contacted by the restaurant about my review. They invited us to come back and try it again. I took my husband this time and was hoping to love it. We placed our reservation online and unfortunately, we were late because of traffic. I was worried about being late but they sat us right away which was so nice. We ordered the guacamole for starters. It was delicious. They really do have some of the best guacamole I've ever had. I like their chips but some chips in our basket were still soft and very chewy. It kind of makes it hard to eat when they are so chewy. When we did get a crispy chip, it was awesome. My husband ordered the chile relleno and since I wasn't feeling super hungry, I just order the tamale off the appetizer menu. Presentation was nice. The food looked good. My tamales were more like a corn bread. They were crumbly and not dense like I am used to tamales being. The taste was good, I just wouldn't call what I had, a tamale. The green sauce they served with it was delicious. My husbands dish had a nice kick to it. The pepper was very good. The sauce on the plate was a little too tomato saucy for us but all in all, it was ok. I think the service here is exceptional. Our server was great. She was nice, quick  and on top of things. My husbands soda never went empty and that's good service to me. I have been more than impressed with the service at this place. I have come to the conclusion that the food just isn't too my taste and that is ok. They get five stars for service for sure. I would give the guacamole five stars too. I am glad we got another chance to try it out thanks to the manager, Ross! So overall, super impressed with their service, love the guacamole but the food just isn't for me.",

So, I ordered the Steak Fajita as noted but, when it arrived, it was Chicken.  I really wanted the Steak so I asked for it to be corrected.  The waitress took the blame, said she would get to it right away.  it did take a little long and when it arrived, my wife and our friends were just about done.  Still sticking with the 10 Rating.  The food was so good I don't think I heard any conversation as I was enjoying the Fajitas.  The waitress took care of the issue as she addressed it with the manager and they comp'd my meal.  That was very nice.  Still a 10 rating due to the food.  We also enjoyed a plate of chips and salsa.  Both were really good to with 3 choices of salsa which is a nice change.  When I go back to Vegas, I'm definitely going to El Segundo Sol and getting...of course, Steak Fajitas.  Also, this was pretty cool...the waitress asked how I wanted the steak cooked.  Never-Ever had that question asked of me before.  The fact they asked and delivered how I wanted it added to the rating.  Go there and you will be Happy you did.",

Happy hour til 7, so we sat at a hightop in the bar area. Our server was the bartender who was consistent and attentive.   Ordered the chips and salsa trio which is 2.95 during happy hour (although I think it should be free, or served with a side of beans). It's a lot of chips for three little dishes of salsa, and I've thought this before.   Decided to order one taco off the happy hour menu and the steak fajitas from the regular menu. Seemed like a better value,considering we were hungry. The steak was cooked medium rare, like we requested. Came with a delicious side of cilantro rice, beans, guac, sour cream and salsa. Also on the plate, a little corn on the cob and asparagus.   The total bill was 38 for two beers, a cocktail, chips and salsa, a happy hour fish taco and the steak fajitas. Pretty good value and a delightful experience.",

I had their braised pork tacos for lunch, which were delicious! The service was great too.

They have both indoor and outdoor seating which is for the most part covered my shade and misters so it's pretty tolerable in 110 weather. The food tastes great, it's very fresh and a simple clean tastes. It's also vegetarian friendly. I personally really enjoy their veggie tacos with corn tortillas. As much as I love the food, I feel like they have a lot of staff turnover and I'm disappointed they serve at strip prices.   Dining in:  Check for their specials of the day A bit loud inside Typical strip prices however ask valet or mall concierge for a 25% off card to help the cost!  Bar / Happy Hour Pretty good happy hour They carry Dos Equis AMBER (rare find in vegas) Happy hour applies to both the indoor and outdoor bar Menu includes both food and drinks specials",

We have found a group of eateries that we would never miss when we are in town and we have added this wonderful place to our list of MUSTS!  Our stay, usually involves us asking the door guys and valets where to eat.  Tacos El Gordo was the one stop we had wanted to make. Unfortunately, they lacked items we were searching for as well as some more formal seating.  Craving tacos, we went in search of tacos and found El Segundo.  Suffice it to say, our 12 year old who does not EVER eat rice (since age 5) ate up all the lime cilantro rice then ate mine and her fathers.  I (as you will know) am a huge meat eater. I ordered the vegetarian tacos out of curiosity and to say that it was beyond delicious, would be an understatement.  The lime cilantro rice, reminds me of the lime cilantro rice they serve with black beans and chicken...I believe is a Cuban dish...?  I was told by Ross (one of the owners) that the rice is not the most popular thing but to be honest...it SHOULD be.   The service Nikki provided was impeccable and the service of the entire staff was stellar.   Will definitely return for more grilled veggie eats.  Thank you El Segundo staff, your food was delicious and your service only enhances the above amazing flavors.",

We ordered the spicy guacamole and were not disappointed. The guac was delicious; chunky & spicy, with onions, peppers, tomatoes and just the right amount of lime juice, not just mashed avocados like many restaurants try to push off on poor, unsuspecting customers. My husband had the beef fajitas which were cooked to a perfect medium rare. I had the Baja fish tacos, fish was crispy and tortillas were so good. We both had the black beans which were nicely seasoned and a nice side. Same for the cilantro-lime rice. Service at all tables seemed to be great, but we were there early for dinner. Although the food was fairly pricey, we used the Tix4Tonight dining card and got a really nice 25% off! This is good Mexican food on the strip and worth the stop for a break from gambling or shopping in Fashion Show Mall.",

Our heads were turning just to find him until we saw a bunch of employees just in the corner talking, which easily can get anyone kind of upset.   The food overall was pretty good. The chips and salsa is awesome because it comes warm and with three different salsas - all of which are really good. I only wish at least one of them had more heat. I wasn't too hungry so I ordered a chicken quesadilla appetizer. I thought it was solid. It's hard to mess up a quesadilla. My mom got a chicken enchilada. It was quite mild also, but the size was good. It came with beans and cilantro rice, which was more like garlic rice. We also got one elote. It had little flavor and not worth the price. I've definitely had better Mexican elsewhere.",

I stopped here after a long stay in Vegas before driving home to California and I was very full! Portion size is large and very filling. Ordered the bottomless chips for an appetizer. Came with pico de gallo, salsa verde and a delicious smokey chipotle salsa. The chips and dips had me full before my entree arrived. For lunch I had the baja shrimp taco platter. The dish comes with delicious cilantro rice and black beans. I really loved the rice, as I am a huge cilantro fan. The black beans were solid and also tasty. The corn tortillas were sweet and soft, the platter came with five small corn tortillas, a nice large portion of fried shrimp and a green avocado/lime sauce as well as a chipotle crema. My only complaint is that I wish the shrimp had not been fried...there was too much batter on the shrimp and it did not add anything to the dish. Just freshly sauteed lime shrimp would have been much nicer. My partner's salmon tacos were also delicious and our friend's chimichanga was very very large, so large, he was unable to finish it. This place is not going to win any food awards for being authentic mexican, however it was very good, prices were decent for the strip and portion sizes were large. Atmosphere was fun, we sat near the bar, outside, with plenty of people watching.",

Maybe we have different concepts of ahi tuna, but this thing was a pale ass color and tasted, well... FISHY. Not to mention this thing came with a side of tortilla chips and saltine crackers... Excuse me saltine crackers? Where the hell does that fit into this Mexican dish? Oh also my friend ate a dish with jalapenos (she's allergic) and it was not mentioned on the menu. Very unprofessional place. Only saving grace was the tortilla chips (very tasty) and a good location with lots of unsuspecting tourists.",

Kori responded to all of my emails/calls very quickly. Initially we were going to do a \"set\" menu and then switched to a la carte. Kori was very accommodating in making this change.  When we arrived on Saturday we had the \"Ventana\" room reserved. This was awesome, as we had the entire room to ourselves. The glass walls allowed for a perfect view of the strip. The wait staff was awesome as well. Quick to take drink and food orders. I had the tortilla soup which was delicious. Even had a little flair, as the waiter placed a bowl of the \"dry\" ingredients in front of me. Then poured the soup from a separate pitcher into the bowl. Most of the girls ordered tacos, and everyone was pleased with their meal. I was pretty stoked that they sold tall cans of beer, so that's what I had for drinks. Others in our party ordered margaritas and said they were good and strong. Which is great....because we knew when we got to the clubs drinks would double (if not triple) in price.  The staff was also spot on in separating the checks. We pretty much broke into small groups rather than have one big check. With as many people as we had in our party, all checks came out correctly.  I really appreciate the staff and Kori for helping us have a great time. I definitely recommend coming here with any size group!!   THANKS AGAIN KORI FOR ALL YOUR HELP!! WE HAD A GREAT TIME...I PLAN ON COMING BACK WHEN IN VEGAS!!",

I have to admit it is hard not to order margaritas when every one else around you is getting one, but I do refrain! (I will stop by someday and get them as everyone on yelp is raving about them.)   Service has always reliable. They know the menu well and are good at making suggestions even when we don't follow them. ;-) They are quick to refill water or soft drinks. And of course the food is always awesome! We have had the combo fajitas several times and they are the current fav. Nachos and guac is our standard appetizer as well and it always disappear quickly....   You know, I think I'll go to lunch there today!!",

    "text": "Matt C. and I went here on Saturday night, and to be honest, I was a little taken aback by the prices and some other things. Now now, before you get your panties in a bundle, I do realize it is the strip so of course things are going to be more expensive. I just cannot understand why 4 small corn tortillas, a sliced grilled chicken breast, black beans, and cilantro rice was $15. I also can't understand why their 14 oz margaritas range from $12-14. You can go anywhere on the strip and pay $10 more for a yard, and I know that because I used to work at a Mexican restaurant on the strip that sold yards of margaritas.  Basically El Segundo Sol took the place of Cafe Ba Ba Reeba. The remodel kept a lot of the elements of Ba Ba Reeba such as the wood panels, the entire bar, and various other things. What I could not understand is why they had posters and magazines decoupaged on the yellow walls of matadors from famous posters of bullfighters in Spain. Is this Mexican or Spanish with all of the leftover Ba Ba Reeba decor and the obviously off cultural elements? Spanish culture and Mexican culture, two different things. I'm digressing from the actual experience so let's get to that.   So we walk into a packed restaurant on a Saturday night. Luckily there was no wait time for the two of us, and we got sat right away. It took us a couple minutes to get greeted by an attractive waitress wearing a black guayabera unbuttoned enough so we could see her lacy black bra (hey if you got it, then get it giiiiiirl). Service was friendly but the timing was off.  It took longer than what it should of to bring our Prickly Pear Margarita and Organic Margarita to the the table. I ordered the chicken tacos since Matt already ate and in that time frame (15-20 minutes) the table in front of ours got sat, ordered food, received their food and was 5 minutes into enjoying their food before I even got my plate of tacos. I was about to ask where my comida was when the food runner brought it out. I know it was busy, I work in restaurants but it shouldn't of taken 20 minutes to bring a plate of tacos to the table. The chicken was tender and the rice and beans were good. The plate was served in a DIY style with everything laid out for you and some corn tortillas in a tin cup. No complaints on that, but it should of been around $11 not $15. We got done, saw a runner carrying flan, thought YUM and decided to split it. We got talked into ordering the tres leches cheesecake instead, which was okay. It was COVERED in cinnamon. It could of been sifted onto the dessert without using a quarter of a jar of cinnamon. Honestly, it tasted like bread pudding and  looked sort of like bread pudding. It was a circular mushy cake emulsified in a syrup and covered in cinnamon. We got a $9 discount because of Matt and the grand total came out to $38. It was $47. The price points were as such: 14 oz Pickly Pear margarita $12 14 oz organic margarita $13, chicken tacos $15, and tres leches $5.   In conclusion, the service was friendly, the ambiance was nice (albeit completely not authentic), but the prices and the timing need work. If the price points were brought down 1-2 dollars it would be more accessible to locals and more on par with what the place is, which is an Americanized Mexican fusion restaurant on the strip.",

I also think the happy hour is one of the best on the strip, lets face it most happy hours suck and they only include beer! You can get a delicious margarita here that you can actually taste the booze in! If you compare this place to say cabo wabo, the prices and food quality are 100% better! Everything I have had here is so delicious and fresh tasting, plus they do gluten free options!   I have been here numerous times and i have to agree with sometimes not so great service, however most of the time service has been super! I guess it just depends who's working!

    "text": "This review is for the Loco Hour  4-7 and 11pm - close Everyday in the bar area  We ordered: Big Stick Margarita - $4.95 Mexelent Mango Margarita - $4.95 Strawberry Margarita - $4.95 (3) Tequila shots - $2.95ea.  Bottomless chips & 3 salsas - $2.95 (2) Fully loaded pork burritos - $5.88ea. Tableside Guacamole - $8.95 (not on loco hour menu) Total: $47.36 (not incl. tax/tip)  I have definitely had better, cheaper happy hour. The items on the Loco Hour aren't even that discounted. The bottomless chips and salsa seem very cheap...until you look at the original menu and see that they're $2.95 all the time! The drinks are discounted by about $2. The only thing I found to be a pretty good value were the burritos and tacos. On the regular menu, the tacos are only served in platters that will run you about $15, but you can get then for $2 a piece on the Loco Hour menu. The burritos don't even exist on the regular menu, but you can get them for $4.93 on the Loco menu (+.95 to make it fully loaded). They're stuffed with fresh guacamole, sour cream, pickled jalapeno, shredded lettuce, rice beans, and meat. I didn't order one for myself, but I had a bite of Don's and it was delish! The pork was very soft and the guacamole was so fresh and chunky. I'm also a sucker for burritos with rice inside. I just wish they'd learn how to wrap them up better. They were wrapped like enchiladas. Thankfully, Don's teenage job was at Del Taco, so he fixed that problem in a flash. The guacamole came in a giant mortar. We didn't expect to get so much guacamole, but we had no problem eating it all anyway.   The ambiance was nice. We came at exactly 4pm in the middle of the week, so there weren't that many people there. There are strings of little light bulbs hanging from the dark wooden ceiling and there is a lot of light from outside in the bar area during the day. The bathrooms are pretty fancy too (if you can ignore the piping under the sinks). Each stall and sink  is separated by a tile wall and there are lots of places to hang your bags or coats.   Overall, the place was nice. I'd come back here for the Loco Hour burritos if I ever happened to be walking around Fashion Show mall between 4-7pm and craving a burrito (not very likely), but not for anything else.",

I stuck with beer, but my BF tried their margaritas. They were good! This is definitely one of my top places to go for HH. I love places with a good vibe, clean, and easy!  DINNER - made reservations the day of for a party of 11. When we got there, they had given us the private room! Yay! Our waitress was ah-maz-ing! She divided our check so each person's order was sub-totaled; fantastic when you are dealing with people who have been drinking for the past two hours. I only got their version of the garden salad because I filled up on chips and drinks! The salad was very tasty though, and used quality ingredients. Everyone was very satisfied with their food - those that got the house rice were especially raving about its taste. My GF order \"The Big Stick\" in 32oz. Huge, pretty, and yummy if sugary drinks are your thing. Definitely fun to look at though!  During both visits, all employees were attentive and helpful. The prices are very reasonable, and the serving sizes are perfect so you don't have to worry about being too stuffed to fit into your club gear!",

Overall one of my favorite restaurants in vegas, everything is amazing, EVERYTHING, tacos, taquitos, micheladas, margaritas, great beer selection,  The food is a little pricey but it's well worth it.  I recommend just eating at the bar area and enjoying the view of the strip.  Love this place!!  Start off with a Modelo Especial michelada and order anything off of the menu and you'll start the day/night off right!!   Portions are a little small so if you're a fat slob that just wants a ton of food, you might not want to eat here.",

It was absolutely gross and I actually had a huge stomach ache afterwards. Whether the tacos are $3 or 50 cents, it wasn't worth it given the small portions and the overall quality of the food. The service was really slow as well. It was just disappointing in general. Thank goodness we found a much better Mexican Place and I'll review that next.",

On another note: My company requires an \"itemized\" receipt for everything on an expense report. I mistakenly took the receipt with just the total on it. When I contacted the restaurant a week later they went out of their way to find and send me a copy of the itemized bill. This shows what a dedicated and well run operation they have there!

    "text": "NOT WORTH IT!!  STAY AWAY!!!  I am a BIG fan of Mexican food.  El Segundo Sol is as generic as you are going to get when it comes to Mexican food.  Beyond watered down.  Most generic Mexican restaurants still get it right with somewhat decent food.  But almost everything was lousy...I will start with the food..  In what seems like an effort to be authentic of gimmicky, they bring out this bottle of water that caps off.  It looks like something they might pour your water with in a restaurant in Mexico maybe?  So it gets poured into these tiny little glasses.  The water is warm and is clearly tap water.  I'm perfectly fine with tap water at restaurants. Next time, just fill a glass up with ice and turn on the sink.  At least it will be cold, which usually helps to mask the tap flavor.  Get rid of this lame gimmick.  We got the bottomless chips and salsa.  Chips were kind of oily and super thick.  The salsas were just OK.  It all just tasted old.    The three of us each ordered an entree.  The chicken enchiladas were dry and kind of flavorless.  They come with a side of rice and beans.  The rice tasted like the instant kind.  The fish tacos were terrible.  It all comes separate and you make your own.  The red, creamy sauce was pretty good.  But the mahi mahi was grilled so strangely in this big lump that didn't pull apart well.  It just had the flavor of burnt as well.  It's sad when I had to douse it with Tapatio to make it edible.  My girlfriend got the chicken quesadila, which actually was not bad.  But you deserve negative points if you can't make a quesadilla.    The service was strange.  First, we had this unfriendly girl who was with us up until she took our order.  Then this creepy guy became our server, even though we kind of just thought he was a busboy until we realized the girl wasn't coming back.  He was attentive, but wayyyyy overboard.  It was like, what does he want now..  Overall, this place sucks and I will never go back.  Maybe if the prices were half of what they were (well no, not then either).  But 17.99 for those nasty fish tacos and 15 for the enchiladas was ridiculous..    If you want good Mexican food at the Fashion Show Mall, visit TacoMaker in the food court.  Their Daily Special is $5.99 and it is delicious.  Enchilada style burrito, small portion of nachos, and a crunchy taco.  Mmmmm.  I wish we had gone there instead.. :(",

Great customer service and the food- tacos,huitlacoche quesadillas (wow), salsas, incredible tamale, even the mexican pizza was great. so, the next day, we return to watch the Giants Playoffs. Well, 6 Hours, 18 innings later- the staff, the manager, the food--all still fresh, friendly, awesome! and Jalapeno cilantro margarita! Whenever we return to Vegas, we will be eating there!

Was there for our National Meetings and we closed El Segundo Sol and Stripburger for a few hours on both Saturdays so our Coordinators could enjoy a delicious meal on the Strip.  Hands down, best decision ever. Kori Zornes was fantastic from start to finish in helping us pick our menu and in execution. We had 400 diners both Saturdays and everyone seemed to have an absolute blast.   The staff were incredibly accomodating and very quick to replenish all food and drinks. Kori and the entire El Segundo Sol staff were amazing and if we find ourselves in Vegas again, it's a no-brainer that we'll use this restaurant again!",

The hostesses were very rude and had to flag down someone to our table every time we needed something. The restaurant was not that busy. We asked to be moved to a bigger table because we were crammed at a small table for a party of 4 and were told no because other reservations had the tables reserved, when I made our reservation hours in advance. Throughout our whole dinner we were the only ones in the dining area. Staff definitely needs a refresher on customer service. We won't be returning. Bathrooms were dirty and birds were in the dining area which I understand can't be controlled always with an indoor/outdoor establishment. Location is very convenient on the bright side being right off the strip with free parking at fashion show mall.",

Not to mention, the menu is lacking and overpriced - basically chicken and beef options only.  And the food is not good.  It tasted like it was all previously frozen out of a box and we paid $20 per entree for taco platters and fajitas.   Save yourself the walk and let's just say your better off hitting up any of the other thousand restaurants in Vegas.",

Last night there, we stumbled across this Mexican Restaurant called El Segundo Sol. This restaurant has everything imaginable  ambience, hospitality,  and of course the best tasting Mexican food ever at very reasonable prices! So delicious! I had a grilled chicken and a crane asada taco, guacamole,  and a mint cucumber margarita!! We were also treated to a flan treat. Wow!!! The taste was unbelievable! I so wanna be there now! The food made my mouth dance!! Thanks to Marsel, Restaurant Manager, and our waitress Michelle for excellent service!!!",

Ross Buter who is the manager offered me a free meal there, but he wouldn't be in on the day we would have gone in, but since it was our first time in Vegas, me and the wife didn't want to repeat restaurant on this trip. Thus Ross offered me a certificate (without an expiration date) to eat at any Lettuce Entertain You Restaurants' establishment.   That was a really kind gesture and as promised I received that letter in the mail with two gift certificates totaling $50. So I plan on definitely visiting an establishment and will 100% be going back to El Segundo Sol on my next trip to Vegas which will be rather soon.   I'll be updating this review again and possibly another Lettuce establishment in the near future.",

My fiance had the chicken enchiladas, with black beans and rice. It was quite tasty. They only serve cilantro rice, so if you prefer Spanish rice, it's not an option. The grande frozen margarita was good however, I didn't like the glass that it came in; it was difficult to drink out of it. I would recommend a margarita glass for a margarita. Versus a long stem glass that's used for beers.  Despite the food, our waitress (LaTonya) and the manager were very polite.  I was not a fan of the food but the service was acceptable.",

Located on the strip, and with indoor/outdoor seating, we chose outdoor on a night that was 110 degrees. Yet it wasn't too uncomfortable. They have misters going from above in fake trees with lights. A very lovely setting! We got fajitas and carne asada. We also got the guacamole to share. That was excellent! We also had drinks that were good. Can't recall the name but it was purple and like a cactus pear or something. Yummy. Enjoy!",

The first time I went with a group of 4 people and sat in the back. The service was fast and the employees were very nice and helpful. We had someone in the group who could not eat salt and the employees had everything made for her without salt.  The second time was a party of 2 and we sat at the bar to people watch on the strip. It was happy hour. Go during happy hour--the sangria pitcher is half price (15.00) and so good. They had a ton of items half price and the service was just as good as before.   The tortillas are homemade and OMG are they good. The gauc is also freshly made and so good with the homemade chips. The BF had the fajitas both times and the looked delicious. He said the steak was cooked perfectly and was really filling. I had the beef street taco and green cheese enchilada. Wow-- I think I could of had just one taco and would have been full.  If you go (which you should)-- park in the red zone under Neiman Marcus. It's the closest to the restaurant. I think the prices are pretty average and the food was amazing.",

We ordered a few happy hour items and the rest were off the regular menu. We had a discount card that was refused because we had ordered items on the happy hour menu. We were told after that our discount should have been applied to all the regular priced items. That was disappointing.",

I had the Mahi Mahi Tacos and it was cooked perfectly. The staff was terrific and attentive. The manager also checked on us a couple of times to make sure we had what we needed and even brought out some salsas from the kitchen to try out. There is indoor and outdoor seating to accommodate any mood. Look forward to returning in the future.",

There is a nice outside area with Misty sprays or there is open air indoor dining as well. There is lots of free parking if you decide to drive at the mall/shopping center.  We came at happy hour and decided to start with the nachos with chicken. They were delicious, the best I've had in a long time. Topped with plenty of cheese, guacamole and sour cream. I got the grilled mahi mahi fish taco, grilled steak taco, and braised pork taco. They were all excellent filled with a generous portion of meat.  Each came with a slice of lime. The mahi mahi was my favorite but I recommend all of them.   I got the frozen prickly pear margarita. It was made perfectly, not too sweet, and a generous pour of tequila. It's made with pureed prickly pear cactus fruit. I love the vibrant pink color. It was so good and refreshing we got another!  The food and drink and ambience are really a 4. But due to the service it gets a 3. It took awhile to get our food, and three times they brought us the wrong order. Then when we got the check, they over charged us. They brought the 2nd bill and it was still wrong. We also never had our water glasses refilled and had to ask. The food and drink are very good and I like the location. I will definitely be back and hope for better service so that I can upgrade my review.",

    "text": "If you are traveling to Las Vegas DO NOT PASS UP El Segundo Sol! Located in the north end of the Fashion Mall, next to the Strip Burger, (which they also own) it may just be the best meal you will get in Las Vegas! Forget the celebrity chef's restaurants like Gordon Ramsey (See my review!) and eat here instead! If I had known about this before I went to Vegas I would have just ate here for every meal! We had gone to Gordon's the night before and were really disappointed with our meal there! By the time we left El Segundo Sol I wanted them to open one here in Washington State because it will be the standard that I will measure Mexican food to from now on! We arrived on the evening of March 19th and were immediately seated. Our server Alxandre was really great and let us know about the specials and asked if we had any food allergies or restrictions. (we don't but still very cool!) I decided on the Achiote Mahi Mahi Fajitas and my wife went for the Braised Beef Tacos. The difference between Gordon's braised beef and the braised beef on my wife's tacos was like night and day! So much flavor and very tender & juicy! I think every bite she took was followed up with an \"OMG\" or \"Sooo Goood!\". My Fajitas had grilled asparagus, grilled cherry tomatoes (hell yes!) and a piece of grilled corn on the cob as well as the rest of the normal fare which was fantastic. The achiote Mahi Mahi was flakey yet firm and perfectly cooked. Everything was perfectly seasoned and delicious. There was also four cups on the side that contained sour cream, pico de gallo, salsa, and guacamole (fresh made!) Mark (not sure if he was owner or manager) served our food to us and when he came to check on us I made mention of our dismal meal the night before and he was not surprised. We had quite a discussion about quality vs. hype and he really gets it! He told us that everything is made fresh on site from the guacamole to the sweet cream used in the desserts! We are not drinkers but since everything was so fantastically good we decided to get a couple of margaritas on the rocks. WOW! Yes, they were strong, but the best part was the 'mix'. Most margaritas I have had are a little sour or too citrusy, but these drinks, like the food, tasted great! I never knew that a margarita could have such a depth of flavor. Forget the normal sides you get of rice & beans at other places because El Segundo Sol has thankfully made them so much more than 'that stuff on the plate that you won't eat'! The Oaxacan black beans were just downright delicious. They are a smaller black bean, about half the size of a normal black bean, and filled with flavor. And the Cilantro rice totally blew me away! So simple yet so great! I'll never be the same again. I wish I could have tried everything on the menu... I have to go back to Vegas just for this place! We finished the meal with the Dulce de Leche cake and like the rest of the food was out of this world good! Firm cake, yet moist and lots of Dulce de Leche sauce and not too sweet. It was the perfect ending to a perfect meal!  When we left I mentioned to Mark that compared to Gordon's, El Segundo Sol was $100 less but 100 times better! Great job! Next time in Vegas I will not go anywhere else.",

This elote corn is so bomb, I almost ordered a second one.  It's moist  and sexy, and will make your taste buds excited.  Two thumbs up !! It was amazing.

Thank goodness for this place because there's not very many (if any) places on the strip that are any good to me. El Segundo has lots of healthy options for both meat eaters and vegetarian/vegans and great service to top it off.  Over the weekend, we were here two days in a row. The location is super convenient as it's walking distance from the hotels and any excuse to stroll through the mall is a good one.   Repeat orders: - Taco Salad may be a special and not always on the menu, but it's so good and so fresh! The citrus dressing is amazing amazing and the taco shell is very thin and goes nicely with the salad. - Steak/Chicken/Mahi fajitas. Comes in a sizzling plate with lots of veggies and all the fixins. Ask for the corn tortillas.  - 3 Tacos plate, which is a smaller portion of the fajitas plate without the sizzle and grilled veggies. Just depends on how hungry you are.  The restaurant can get busy, but we've never had to wait. We are always seated promptly and orders come out really fast. Service is top notch!",

To start with the service, everything was great, customer service very good, and our waitress was very kind and went over the menu with us. About the food, chicken tacos were delicious! I personally got chicken and steak , but chicken had better taste than steak. The tacos are small like street tacos. I also got elote which was so damn good! We all loved our food and were satisfied. If you can stop here around happy hour because they have good deals. Like tacos and drinks for cheaper prices!",

The only setback is that it's next to StripBurger, one of our favourites.  So when we are on this part of the strip, we usually go there.

The place is well decorated with wallpaper style magazine pages from various Mexican magazines and art prints. Strands of light bulbs hang cross-crossing across the restaurant.  Dark wood tables and bar lends a semi-sultry vibe, a good place to kick back after a hard night and have a margarita or a repose from a day of shopping.  Food ordered; Three taco plate which comes with black beans. (Quite good,) chicken fajitas with sides of a delicious cilantro rice, black beans, guacamole, pico, cheese, tortillas, etc. (excellent fajitas), one cocktail (vodka and club) and no appetizers as we'd eaten breakfast only a couple hours before.  Our server was friendly and easy-going, checking on us a couple times to see if we needed anything.  Would definitely return, save for the nightmare that is Las Vegas Blvd and the parking situation at the mall, this place is great.  Total bill was $46, minus tip.",

The menu consists of small fare items like chips and salsa ( unlimited ) , you get hot chips and 3 very flavorful salsas a chunky pico , an awesome green salsa , and smoky delicious red , we also got some pork belly tacos which were amazing but had a habanero salsa that really packed the heat , get it on side if spicy isn't your thing . To drink we shared a pitcher of sangria 15$ which lasted us throughout the night and was so good we ordered a second lol. We also enjoyed the queso fundido  with chorizo which for my taste was too salty but everyone else loved it , I did enjoy the small freshly made tortillas that came with it tho , at this point we were quite full but a member of our group decided to order the nachos with chicken, which although amazing and full of marinated pulled chicken and ooey gooey melted cheese , they were barely touched as our server , who was quite friendly and attentive refilled our chips throughout our visit and we enjoyed them a little too much and most of the nachos remained un eaten , all in all it was a great happy hour experience, chock full of good friends, good food and plenty of people watching from the patio area!!,",

    "text": "Visited El Segundo Sol on a Thursday evening at 7pm after mall. Group of six.  The restaurant is walking distance from Trump, Wynn, Treasure Island, Pallazzo or Venetian. Located on the south side of the Fashion Show Mall. 1/2 inside seating 1/2 outside under cover. Fair view of the quiet portion of the strip.  The good: 1) Fresh made corn tortillas are awesome. Kinda small... but great. 2) Braised Beef tacos are excellent. 3) Grilled Chicken tacos are so-so. 4) Chips are good. 5) Salsas are very mild... if you like it that way. 6) Water for the table is served with small glasses and a large cork-top bottle. (kinda cool) 7) Coke products (I prefer Pepsi... ) 8) Fresh guacamole was good. We ordered spicy.. and it wasn't.  The bad: 1) Wait staff is VERY VERY slow and forgetful. 2) Filling the chips and salsa takes too long. must asked twice to remind the staff 3) Fresh Guacamole, although good. Was a very small portion, especially for the price. 4) Food portions were very small for the price. $16.95+ for dinners, with five or six 4\" tortillas and en our meat to stuff three of them. 5) Meals served with seasoned white rice and black beans. More Cuban style than Mexican. 6) Limited menu, and no side orders.  After an extended service, based on the extremely slow staff, combined with the high pricing and small portions... we'll seek out mexican food elsewhere next time. Too bad.... it's close. I'd be willing to pay a premium, if the food was great and the service was too... but it's not.",

Went the other night, decided to go to the inside bar with friends since it was happy hour. 15minutes later no further explanation or menu of the happy hour. No \"what would you like to start off? Maybe water while you wait?\"  No server introducing themselves.   Meanwhile, some older guys sat beside us (arrived several minutes after we sat down), was checked on by the manager, handed water, chips, and even to change the tv channel.  I'm not even going start with white privilege but just know it was clear as day.   Anyway, we got up and decided to go somewhere more welcoming. Walked by the workers and heard the hostess telling the server to check on us AFTER that same server had taken care of the other guests (who were sat by the same hostess that had welcomed us in). Like the fu$&? Really?  You wait to tell the server that we exist a quarter past later? She looked up with this dumb look on her face. 15 minutes lady. And did I mention happy hour was ending in half an hour?  So we spent our money elsewhere. Went to the Linq, had a good time at the Tilted Kilt. Spent a few hundred on food, great drinks, and company. Much more worth it.",

I'm always craving tacos from the taqueria.  typically the strip I stay away from especially Mexican food. It's typically a Tex-mex, which I have learned to not like through the years. But this place gives me hope.  located right on LV Blvd. in front of he fashion show mall, it's a great location and I LOVE decor. Let me tell you about our server Bodi, absolutely awesome.  We have used the travelzoo deal (which is perfect) this time we purchased it but it was usable due to date. (Our fault) We decided to stay anyways. Ordered the Mango frozen margarita, Bloody Mary, and chips and guacamole. The chips are literally right out of the frier which I love they are warm, thick, and crispy. And they make the gauc right there! So spicy and flavor packed! I loved it. Next we split the mahi fajitas, it came out with amazing flavor, warm tortillas, and cilantro lime rice that is PHENOMENAL.  Plus our server was awesome, very nice, not to over bearing, and I had asked him to give me a try at his favorite margarita. (I always love knowing what the servers like! They are around it all the time!)  If you like tequila then this marg is perfect. Jam packed with tequila, perfection.   All in all great time, food, and view was perfect for people watching. We will def be back!   Thanks Bodi!",

The bottomless chips came with 3 salsas all good but very mild ($4.95) where I am from there is no charge for chips and Salsa; it comes with the meal. So I wasn't thrilled about paying for it in the beginning.  But it was worth it! Chips were thick and served warm and included bottomless Salsa too! I asked if they had any hotter salsa and the server quickly brought out 2 more that were hotter and delicious! All of them tasted fresh made and not out of a jar or can.  My husband got chicken fajitas and they came with delicious cilantro lime rice and black beans and warm fresh tortillas. Nice white meat chicken, peppers, cherry tomatoes, and a mini corn cob. I got the taco special of 3 crunchy tacos with my choice of meat. I chose pork with pineapple, beef and shrimp.  The Pork was by far the best, and the most flavorful; but they were all good. I think they would have been better if served the the fresh warm tortillas that my husband had. This dish also came with the cilantro rice and black beans. I also liked that everything was not a cheesy mess like most Mexican places.  While the prices are all high in Vegas especially on the strip we felt like we had a great meal for the price.",

The New Year's dinner was a four course menu, with a few offerings for each course. I had the package that included the open bar, which was fantastic. The drinks were very strong by the end of the night, which I definitely preferred. All the drinks were basic, margarita, mojito, etc, but they were all delicious.  Our first course was chips, salsa, and guacamole. I loved the guacamole especially. It was incredibly flavorful. For the second course, I had a chorizo quesadilla. A person in our group ordered a ceviche, and I was incredibly jealous. It was fantastic.  For the entree, I had pork belly tacos. They were mostly tasty, but incredibly fatty so kind of difficult to eat. I liked the beans, but the rice was bland. For dessert, I had a chocolate cake, two layers with frosting and covered in chocolate ganache. Delicious, but such a large meal that I could barely eat it.  I feel a 3 course meal for slightly less would have been the bet option, but overall, we had good food and service as this restaurant.",

My mom got the blackberry margarita, which was good though a little on the sweet side.",

The staff was amazing as well!! The manager took time to come to our table and made us feel very welcome! Our server was very sweet too!   Review on the food: We started with the guacamole which was very good! It came with salsa. We had 2 kinds one was their house which was awesome! She also gave me a small portion of the habanero salsa and it was fire! Amazing!! Only for spicy lovers though! She did say they had a hotter salsa but I didn't want to push myself!   Thenwe both had the carne asada tacos. OMG! Such great flavor! The meat was great! After all the chips/salsa/guac we wish we would have just shared the tacos! We left miserable from eating too much! It was too good to leave behind though! If we come back to Vegas we will definitely be back!!",

As Mexicans, we enjoyed the Mana that was playing. Unfortunately, as soon as we sat down the music changed to the likes of Jason Derulo and Lil Wayne fans.  The food, however, was delicious and tasted pretty authentic. The chips and salsa were amazing. All three salsas were delicious. The parentals ordered the guacamole which I'm guessing they loved because they devoured it.    I opted for the Chicken Tacos which were served with Mexican Rice and Black beans. Let me just say, yuum! The tortillas were served rolled up in a tin, which is pretty convenient.   Mom ordered the Chile Relleno. When it comes to Chile Relleno's she's very critical because \"none are better than the one's she makes.\" But, she seemed to love it.   I'm giving it 4 stars for the not so Mexican music that played through out our visit. It is a \"Mexican\" restaurant after all. I believe this restaurants belongs to the same owners as Mon Ami Gabi. As a themed restaurant, I expected the music to follow.",

The fajitas I ordered were dry and dosed in copious amounts of salt. The tortilla tasted like the kind that come from the grocery store. They were bland. This is an instant removal of one star for any Mexican restaurant. Any decent Mexican restaurant makes their tortilla from scratch. It's really not difficult and it does not take a lot of time. My wife had the enchiladas which were just as forgettable. El Segundo gets two and half stars so I am rounding up to three. The margaritas and the service were the best of this restaurant.

Don't recall her name but she was really cute and not totally stuck on herself like most cute bartenders.    Food was great. Really perfect. That is how an enchilada plate should taste, satisfying portion size.    One of the partner/owners of the restaurant stopped by and visited for a moment as well as the manager Marcel.  Down to earth people running a classy operation with great food.  This place should be on your list for lunch and happy hour no doubt.  I'd guess the dinner hours are the same but will have to come back soon to check it out..",

I figured when you're in vegas, everything is expensive anyway. But our waitress was really cool and the catering manager, Kori, was tremendously helpful.

We were staying at the Trump International hotel and walked through the Fashion Mall where the concierge gave us a coupon for 25%.   The first time we came it was discounted margaritas (frozen even) and appetizers. The ceviche wasn't on the happy hour list but it was awesome and would recommend.   We came back another night. They were very busy and the kitchen wasn't taking orders so we sat at the outside bar with Maria and enjoyed a few drinks while kitchen got caught back up.   We ordered the gauc and split an order of steak fajitas. Omg we were both stuffed. The food was so so good. It was a very nice change of pace to being on the strip.  I really really enjoyed my time eating here and if it isn't too hot I would recommend sitting at the outside bar with Maria. Would eat here all the time if I were local. Hope I can come again!",

I was full just with that. They had 3 different salsas - salsa Verde, roasted salsa, pico De gallao which was really salty and mixing it with the other salsas made it edible.  The steak taco is a good choice at almost $20 a plate but it was a good amount of meat, rice and beans. The chicken quesadilla was small but good enough for 1 if you pigged out on the chips. Also got a side if elite which was really roasted with cheese, chili, and lime. Good but not cooked enough for me.",

They have bottomless chips and salsa - they serve you three different types of salsa with your chips and they are all very delicious.  Food arrived promptly. I ordered the braised pork tacos. Meat was nice and tender. It came with rice, beans, pico de gallo, salsa, sour cream, limes, cilantro, and last but not least, tortillas. Our server also brought out 5 sauces that we could try for our tacos or chips, all ranging from mild to killer spicy. If you can handle the heat, which I can't, you will love them.  Also worth noting is that one person in our party eats gluten-free only, and they have a menu for that.",

The thing of it is, for me anyways, I always tip 20% if the service is even slightly above avg. By \"forcing me into 18% auto added for a party of 7, I left no additional tip for our server just because I don't like being told what to tip. Now the rest of my opinion is below based on our experience........  The food here was above average with regards to freshness, and taste.  The service was above average as well, all though it was a Sunday afternoon so I can not comment on how service may be at crunch time if you will. Pricing, I felt this place was really overpriced over all...... I get it's on the strip, but for the overall experience, IMO, it was not worth the money or time.",

    "text": "Concerned in their lack of customer service. At the outside bar last night I see some movement out of the corner of my eye, I took a second look only to see a large cockroach crawl in front of my plate. I found the bartender & told him what happen. He didn't seem surprised or shocked by it.  He proceeded to go about his business. I then got his attention and told him the roach was now crawling around the bar in the garnish containers around the sink and glasses. He finally found the roach and scooped it up. I told him I didn't want my food. I was expecting a mgr to come by or some kind of sign of apology or remorse. Nothing. Several minutes later I asked the bartender if they were going to take care of my meal that I didn't eat and the response was no. What? The manager finally came out, and tells me that I need to pay for my food because he can't control the outside environment. I understand that, but he acted like I was just trying to score a free meal. Ok first off I didn't even finish my food, I barley drank my cocktail and you still want me to pay for it? After some discussion, the manager finally agreed to take care of my food and beverage bill which was the right thing to do. But why was there any discussion about it? Oh and they didn't pay for my husbands dinner.  I understand the outside element may come in, but my biggest concern is that the bartender & mgr were not shocked about the roach and acted like I was unreasonable. Are roaches a common occurrence there?",

They have bottomless chips and salsa made from the hand made corn tortillas that are bigger than average size and they weren't over salted like most corn chips. My kids had the beef fajita platter. They bring it out in a sizzling skillet that is followed by an intoxicating aroma of grilled onions and peppers. I ordered the beef enchiladas. They were delicious, scrumptious and addicting The red sauce on it was finger licking good and the beef was so tender and full of flavor. Portions are huge! We were stuffed! No left overs though because it was that good! Margaritas are strong too they don't skimp on the tequila.",

Only downside was that they are unlimited if you pay the additional $4.95 (first round is free), however, we didn't mind seeing we love our chips and salsa! It was worth it. They even packaged up chips and salsa for us to take to go. The steak fajitas were delicilous as well as my chile relleno. LOVED the cilantro lime rice.

It's a build your own setup on the plate.  I would have to say braised beef were quite juicy and our favorite. :)) We did the table side guacamole which was a bit oily but it definitely had a great taste!

    "text": "Was here with the wife and a dear friend. To be honest, I would have had a great evening at Taco Bell just because of the company.  Service was a bit slow, and they weren't that busy. Lots of options for tequila. I had a margarita with Don Julio Reposado, and it was exactly what I expected. They offer tableside guacamole (which really is just an expensive way of proving your guac didn't come from a Sysco container). The guac was good, but not spectacular. Chips were fresh, but not hot. I admit I am a snob when it comes to tortilla chips. The salsa options were all pretty bland.  My entree was forgettable. But my wife's tacos were really good. So I guess those are hit or miss. All in all, the experience could have been better. I think this is one of those places where if you find a dish you really like, you can have a consistently great experience. But it's just as likely you will be disappointed on your first visit.",

But you really can't be picky when they cost 2.75..  The quesadillas on the happy hour menu were huge! I thought I'd be getting small portion, but it seriously satisfies like an average meal.",

    "text": "Great location and atmosphere. We sat towards the front left seating area which wasn't so spacious. No room to sit comfortably w/o invading another tables space. Food was great but service was slow. Maybe because it was the weekend of the marathon but it just wasn't what I expected. Also, I ordered a margarita which came with a bug and returned it and the waitress still charged me for it on the bill. Other restaurants would've tried to make it up/waive the drink off the bill. Overall, they have room for improvement especially in the customer service department.",

    "text": "The $60 lunch price tag was a little scary but when in Vegas...  The eats here are delicious.  Bottomless chips?  Sign me up.  The guac is also absolutely amazing, a meal in itself.  Prickly Pear Margarita?  Excellent.  Veggie tacos?  Awesome.  Basically the food itself is incredible but the prices are killer.  We probably could have gone without the guac but it was presented in this manner...\"Would like like some bottomless chips and guacamole?\"  Bottomless chips for $3 is one thing but $10 guac is something completely different.  Loved the ambiance and the outdoor patio.  The patio is nicely shaded from the hot Vegas sun and allows you to stare at passersby on the strip.  Service is pleasant and efficient.  I would eat here again but think twice on the appetizers and mixed beverages, which seem a little pricey.",

The chips and salsa tray was not very flavorful. We had the chicken enchiladas and the veggie tacos. The food was tasty but lukewarm. Gotta get it to customers when it's hot! draft beers are cold. The setting is nice and the service was good but our waiter gave us the wrong bill, take your time!",
