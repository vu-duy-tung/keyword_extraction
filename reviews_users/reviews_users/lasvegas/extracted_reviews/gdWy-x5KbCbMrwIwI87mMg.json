    "text": "Another very good Vegas steakhouse. As with most high end steakhouses on the strip, this place is not inexpensive, but is priced inline with their competitors. In addition to their delicious steaks, they offer a great desert menu (try the hot chocalte chip cookie, topped with ice cream, and served in a hot frying pan). The only downside to this place is, the front of the resturuant has no wall and is completely open to the casino floor. Therefore, there is nothing to block all the noise from the casino from booming through the resturuant....other than being a little noisy, it is a very good resturuant. But for the same price, I rather go to Wynn's SW, Del Friscos, or Charlie Palmer.",

The lobster bisque, which I compare to the east coast, was good but for the lump of what I presumed was lobster in the bowl prior to the \"broth\" was just a lump of  mostly croutons. The wine selection was fair  but the steak, boneless ribeye, was tough. Cooked to order, seasoned well but tough. For the price I could only go 2 stars. A little ( ok allot )disappointed for a $200 meal",

I started with their a slice of their thick bacon and a bowl of lobster bisque.  Both wer outstanding.   The bacon was meaty and the bisque had a spicy kick that made it super yummy!  For dinner, I had the rib-eye steak, gnocchi with butter and truffles.  The steak and gnocchi was awesome....full of intense flavor.  For desert, I had the banana bread pudding....it came with a scoop of ice cream and a super sweet caramel  sauce.   Overall, a great steak meal.  The service was great and the decor was dark woods that screamed old school NY steakhouse.",

    "text": "Me, the wife and a couple of friends ate here while vacating in Las Vegas. This is one of the few times that I have eaten at a Las Vegas steakhouse, the other time was Vic and Anthony's at the Golden Nugget Casino. This steakhouse is at Caesar's Palace next to Nobu's Japanese Restaurant, You cannot mistake the Old Homestead Steakhouse as a steakhouse because there is a giant steer suspended above the entrance to the steakhouse.  We were greeted cordially by the hostess and led to our table. We were quickly met by our waiter who was very nice and efficient. We started with the lobster bisque which was delicious. I ordered a filet mignon, my wife the salmon, our guests, the New York strip and his girlfriend, the halibut. Everything is a la carte but the portions are large enough to share for the table. We got steamed broccoli, wild mushrooms, and asparagus. We ordered a nice bottle of wine which comes with a wine lady who was very nice. Everything was great except the halibut did not come out to well and was undercooked. The waiter was very nice and took it back and he gave us additional free side orders as well as free desert for the trouble. Even the manager came out to apologize. Now that's what I call service. We ordered the Big Fat Chocolate Cake but the slice was so big and we were so full, we took it home instead. I enjoyed myself here and our friends picked up the tab which made it taste even better. Word to the wise, when you go to a steakhouse, don't order the fish. I liked the staff, the food, the drinks, the wine and just about everything about this place. Very professional and they do things up right.",

    "text": "Here's the thing:  If you are going to charge upscale steakhouse prices, then you better serve me a steak that is how I ordered it.  Period, end of story.  I ordered a filet, cooked medium well with NO PEPPER added.  I was very clear that whatever pepper was already on the meat prior to cooking was fine, but I can't stand tasting the pepper on my finished steak.  I'm a firm believer that pepper should be to taste and not done back in the kitchen.  The server assured me he would add the note for no additional pepper.  The filet came and it was cooked perfectly but drowning in pepper.  The pepper was fresh, not cooked off and clearly had been finished off with a couple rounds of the shaker--totally disregarding my request.  UGH.  I tried to cut the top portion of my filet off, but I still tasted it.  So I sent it back.  I waited while everyone else at the table enjoyed their steaks.  The filet eventually came out, but this time they decided to \"butterfly\" it to make it cook faster (odd because I still waited a long time).  What happens when you butterfly a steak but still cook to requested temperature of medium well?  An over-cooked piece of meat for $50.  A total loss.  My husband had eaten halibut for dinner, so graciously offered to eat it for me but agreed it was terrible.  Bottom line:  if you aren't going to give me what I ordered, then don't charge me for the steak.  It's that simple.  I'm adding a star because my first visit to the Homestead was in June and I had a perfect filet.",

Since we were splitting the salad, it was nicely divided in the kitchen. For my entree I ordered filet mignon with blue cheese sauce.  Which was very good. The bread tasted day old. A side of duck  fat fries were good but not outstanding.My wife  ordered NY strip steak on the bone... A chain saw would have been helpful to cut  the meat. She ordered medium rare plus but was served medium and dry. Not until she came close to the bone did she enjoy the steak. Bernaise sauce was good.  Regretful that she didn't send it back and regretful we didn't go next door to Mesa Grill! The bread tasted day old. For a steak diner go to Cut Las Vegas.",

That aside, the service was not very good. The waiter kept forgetting drinks and things we asked for. I asked For a glass of wine and never received it, few people had to ask for things multiple times. If you are going to add 20% for a large party... Then have service that reflects that. The food was good but they messed up majority of the steak temperatures. I think the issue was the waiter could not match what was ordered with where people were sitting. Atleast half of the steaks were delivered at wrong temps, as a steak house this should be a priority. Many people just ate them but a few were sent back. One was still at the incorrect temp. I also added Mac and cheese for both tables.... They brought only to one table and not enough. Overall just a poor experience. For the amount we paid, they just did not deliver. The servers did not seem to care to create a good experience. Won't be returning.",

We only came here because everywhere else was full and needed to stay around Caesars for a quick scurry to Pure after dinner.   Lighting was really dark - so I guess if you're not drunk enough to have your beer goggles on already and need somewhere to take your date so she looks better than you realized this morning... this is the place.  Everything was super super expensive.  I know it's Vegas, but cmon - for a no-name, no-famous chef, 3 yelp star place... NOT worth $66 for a sirloin or even $58 for a 8oz Filet! They do have an Australian Wagyu for $168... haha poor soul who ordered that from this place.  And what's worse... my medium rare filet came out completely cold - from the center to the outside. It was rubbed in so much salt that I think I drank a gallon of water. sigh again.  Kitchen sink salad was ok... but for $18, this salad filled the center of a small plate with lettuce and had two baby shrimp... not much else.   Friends liked the Caesar salad, but again nothing special for a $17 salad.  Everything was super salty.  My friend had to send back 2 dishes because they were just not edible.   What's worse, we overheard the waiter talking about us to another waiter right behind us!! how unprofessional!  Wine list was pricey again of course - nothing by the glass under $15.  Ok that's all. don't go there. waaaay too many yummy eats in Vegas to waste your tummy here.",

The waiter we had was abrasive; he was 'friendly', but made it obvious that he was being friendly for work and did not really want to be. The food was only ok. Their port wine glaze for the steaks adds a sweetness not really at home on a good cut of steak, and it has a vinegary aftertaste. The steak sauce they serve tastes like ketchup and balsamic vinegar were put together in a blender. Our steaks were cooked perfectly, but just failed to impress in the taste department.   As a special thank you, the waiter mistakenly charged the neighboring tables $220 check on our card. When he corrected it he insisted that it had not even gone through yet. He was wrong. We had $220 from our account frozen for the next 2 days due to his error. That is probably not a big deal for most of their clientele, but for two grad students that had to save for a long time to afford this meal, it was a pretty big slap in the face after a disappointing meal.   Vegas has no shortage of great restaurants. There is no reason to waste your time and money on an over-priced decent restaurant.",

    "text": "Going to Old Homestead is a True experience. I work in Las Vegas and am constantly trying new places. Old Homestead has absolutely become my go-to. They make a phenomenal steak, the gnocchi is genuinely the best side I've ever had, and the duck fat fries are mind blowing.  What truly sets Old Homestead apart though? The service. I go to nice restaurants every week and OH is truly special. An example, I went about 6 months ago and had a great waiter who took care of my party. I went back a few weeks ago now and the waiter not only remembered me, my home state, even my last name (it's not an easy one to remember)!  I went back last week and Toshi took care of our entire party. Their focus on our satisfaction is always evident in how they manage our table and their ability to go above and beyond. We will continue to come back as my entire team believes that OH is easily in the top tier of Vegas restaurants.",

    "text": "The good...we arrived 7 minutes after their posted last seating and they still happily sat us.  The service was friendly throughout.  The crab cake ($27) was awesome, very large and almost totally crab without bread crumb filler.  The French onion soup ($15) was good, too, with lots of cheese.  The duck fat fries ($15) were good, too.   The bad...the $68 Gotham ribeye steak was way overcooked...twice.  I ordered medium rare and it came out medium well.  I sent it back telling him I liked it solidly red all the way through and it came back again medium well, fibrous without a stitch of red in it.  I was so disappointed I couldn't even enjoy one bite of this stringy, tough steak, but I couldn't send it back again out of courtesy to the person who was buying me dinner.    Though several of the things we had were good, there is just no forgiving an upscale restaurant way over cooking an expensive steak not once but twice. Plus, though several things we had were good, other than the crabcake, I didn't feel they were remotely memorable enough to warrant the prices.  I wouldn't eat here again.",

    "text": "I stopped by this steakhouse while in Vegas for a convention. The thick-cut Bacon and cheddar and potatoes au gratin are delicious.  Sharing size for   The same can't be said for the steak though. I ordered mine a touch above medium and 2/3 of the steak was perfectly cooked. The thinner side came out well done and was as tough as shoe leather. When I'm paying ~$70 for a steak I'm looking for a great cut of meat, cooked well, and  little to no seasoning so I can enjoy the flavor. This is probably the first steak I've ever had that was bland.  I ordered the peppercorn sauce ($5) to accompany my steak but ended up relying on it for flavor. I mentioned it to the bartender and was offered another steak but I declined it. Instead I received a free dessert which was the berries & cream. It is simply berries and cream, well executed and very tasty.   Why three stars?  The steak was not up to par for the class of establishment or the price I paid. The service, appetizer, sides, and dessert were all great and makes me want to give this place another try.",

I ordered a bone in filet medium rare and it came medium well. Then after sending it back the steak came back medium rare with a cold center. After this complication they did not offer to compensate us for the bad preparation and execution of our meal. I expected better for what is known as an elite steakhouse.",

    "text": "*********************** 757 *************************  4.25 stars            Old Homestead Steakhouse is more of a classic steakhouse. Every thing is big here in portion, it reminds me of Nick and Sam's in TX or Gibson Steakhouse in Chicago; classic, darker dining room, casual diners, classic steakhouse and seafood menu.             The moment we walked in, the 2 hostesses were greeted my nieces nicely, then right way, we got seated at our table. Our server was Berk, he was nice, and chatted up with my nieces, made them feel like princesses.            The wine list was good, but I'm surprised on the limited of wines by the glass. They seem to focus on US wines; I tried to order Bordeaux, Burgundy, Rhone, or even Italian wines by the glass, just US wines for now!?          Another thing bother me was the photographer, she told us it was $25 for picture; then she came back with $65, $85, dropped down to $45? My nieces were confused, and I thought that was cheesy .           Excited for chef Tim Henderson in the kitchen, we were looking forward to try his food.   SALADS: - Kitchen Sink Salad - shrimp, salami, bacon, avocado, tomato, hearts of palm, blue cheese & Champagne vinaigrette - Good size, generous to share.  - Roased Heirloom Beets - arugula, goat cheese, tangerine vinaigrette - I love this salad, light, and citrus, nice to start a nice meal.  RAW BAR: - Shellfish Platter - Maine Lobster, GIGANTIC King Crab Legs, Nigeria Spot Parwns, BC Kusshi oysters, Long Islands Blue Point Oysters; this was the first time I tried Nigeria parwns, they are so big; bigger than 3.5 oyster length. They were sweet and tasty. The King crab legs were nice, fresh. My nieces and I finished this giant platter in like 25 minutes!  APPETIZERS: - Thick Cut Applewood Smoked Bacon - the aroma was insane, with steak sauce recommended by our server Berk. We all loved this dish.  - Kobe Meatball - marinara, ricotta chese. Now most of the folks might not know this or that they don't care; but if you like me, \"Steak is my FAV pet\" you know that KOBE doesn't export steak to the US for at least the last 5-6 years. So I guess this must be a TYPO on the Old Homestead Steakhouse part. Anyway, my nieces loved it, this meatball was the biggest meatball I've ever ate! It's bigger than my knee, and it was quite tasty!   STEAK and side dishes: - The \"Sherry Brothers\" New York Strip - 18 OZ for only $62, clean cut, aged over 30 days, it was clean, juicy, and tasty. If you like a clean cut, this is it, cheaper than the filet mignon cut, but 10 OZ bigger, great to share with a big group of friends.  - The \"Gotham Rib\" Steak on the bone - Rib eye, wow this was 26 OZ cut; it was so juicy, perfectly cooked more on the rare for me; so tender; and I love the charred edges, tasty and a bit fat can do you wonder! It's only $71, this is a STEAL deal for this giant ribeye. I can see my mom would fall in love with this cut! Enough to feed 3 people!  - Duck Fat fries - my nieces was going crazy at this. Why something tasted this good can be bad for your body???  - Potato Gnocchi with Truffle Butter - this was rich, but 1 of my nieces enjoyed it because she eats anything with butter in it!  - Fire Roasted Corn - this was so sweet and sauteed nicely. I finished this side dish myself :-)  DESSERT: The kids had the cast iron skillet of Warm Banana Bread Pudding, caramelized bananas and a giant scoop of vanilla ice cream. I was amazed that they were still going at it!             The menu also offer Australian Wagyu 10 OZ cut fore only $160. If you live in Northern California, you know of Alexander's Steakhouse, you look at paying around mid $200, so for those who complained about the pricing here. I'm in shock.            You want a good aged piece of steak anything in the $70 range is reasonable, and for Vegas, you should add at least 50% on top of it.  I'm so tired of seeing all these non-sense Yelpers gave bad reviews, when all they eat were fast food and caged beef in their life. What knowledge do you have to consider yourself a 'blogger\" of \"foodie\"? Because I'm not!           It likes you complain that a Ferrari is too expensive, and you drive a 10 years old Saturn? Hello, they both take you from home to work or school. Same goes for steakhouse; so they are all beef, go to your belly right? Is that how you write your review? Do you live in an apartment with roommates and compare to million dollars beach front mansion, and complain the mansion is too expensive? Or is it because you can't afford it? How do you judge?          If you want value, and a good traditional steakhouse, come here. Got more value than most steakhouses on the strip; and you can tell them I send you. If you come in with good attitude, you will have a great meal. Because I did.",

Mostly fat and although we wanted it medium rare, it was burnt on the outside.  2nd piece not much better. Brought friends to enjoy the meal but they were unimpressed.  Won't come back.",

That's not difficult because the animal did most of the work already.  We got the double cut bone in ribeye I think and it was big enough for all of us to share.  The best part was getting pictures gnawing on the bone like the flinstones.  But joking aside, the steak was amazing - as were the mashed potatoes and bread that we had with it.  This place is a winner.  Prime steak without the prime attitude of some high end steak houses.  Eat in the bar, be a little rowdy and celebrate great food in a great atmosphere.  It's awesome!",

    "text": "I can't leave Vegas without a steak. The trick is finding a spot, with at least one high dollar steakhouse in each casino. The need to book a large party on short notice tied my hands and narrowed the options a little, and we landed at Old Homestead. Interestingly, while I couldn't get a table for 6...we were seated at a table for 6...as a party of five. Whatever.  We indulged for this one - east and west coast oysters were very good, with nice trimmings. One friend may have found his next expensive hobby, having had his first oysters here after I suggested them. We also had their calamari, which is the traditional fried rings, but is super tender and flavorful, without having a heavy, greasy breading. And I had the steakhouse wedge salad, which I usually don't order, but just seemed right. The salad was HUGE - practically half a head of lettuce, delicious chewy thick bacon, so thick it was basically cubed, cherry tomatoes, and a heaping helping of Maytag bleu cheese. I have to order Maytag - it's from Iowa and so am I (kinda). Plus it's very good. This was a great salad. I ate almost all of it, which was kind of a mistake. I wish I had saved a bit more appetite for the steak.  My steak was the filet on the bone, which was pretty great. Very tender, cooked to an almost perfect medium rare, with wonderful flavor from the bone and the right amount of salt and pepper crust. No need to mess with it any further. I'm starting to love the bone-in filet as a happy medium between the sometimes low-flavor filet and the flavorful but oversized and overly rich bone-in ribeye. This definitely delivered. Our sides were the mac and cheese and the tater tots with \"fat boy\" sauce. These were OK - the tots were clearly homemade, but were a little big - they needed more crisp surface area. The fat boy sauce turned out to basically just be baked potato fixings. I might skip those in the future. The mac and cheese was just kind of basic mac and cheese. I think we could have selected better here, but it didn't get in the way of a great steak.  Our service was friendly and prompt, and the sommelier was friendly and informed without being too snooty (as I seem to think they all are, but then, I'm not a drinker). Price was, I think, on par with what your upper tier steakhouses are going to cost. You can get slightly reduced prices here with whatever Ceasar's player's club card is, a couple bucks off here and there. But it does add up, especially with a large party. Might buy you an extra drink. But for the minimum effort required to sign up, it's worth doing.  If I had to think about the three steakhouses I've been to in Vegas, I think this is the best. It's certainly better than N9NE, and I think it's better than Signature Room at Mandalay Bay as well. So having my hand forced to Old Homestead was not a let down. I would definitely return.",

    "text": "As you can see, I recently ate at this restaurant and had the best meal and service. However, in less than a month, my experience drastically changed. Last week, my colleagues/friends and I were in Las Vegas for a conference. We wanted to go to Gordon Ramsey Steak, but there were no reservations available. I suggested that we dine at Old Homestead because I recently had the best experience. We had a reservation and were seated within a few minutes. Kevin M. was our server. One of my friends and I ordered the exact same meal. We both had the Lobster Bisque and Diver Scallops. My other friend had the Steakhouse Wedge salad and some type of fish... maybe Branzino? The Lobster Bisque hardly had any lobster. I was searching the bowl for it. My friend's salad looked disgusting. It had this thin blue cheese and the lettuce was not cut in a wedge. I've seen a better wedge salad at Black Angus. There was hardly any bacon on it too. I felt bad since I encouraged her to order that particular salad. Then, the meal came. Our scallops were gritty. And, not just one of them, but all of them. Diver scallops are supposed to be grit free because they are harvested by hand. Also, this means that the chef did not thoroughly clean them because that could've prevented the problem. My friend disliked the fish and only ate half of it. To top off the experience, we had poor service. Our server was inattentive. We waited for at least 15-20 minutes to get our check. I felt horrible taking my friends here and kept apologizing to them. As you can see, I was just there less than a month ago and had an awesome meal and experience. I am extremely disappointed and will not be going back. And, now I owe my friends a dinner after the worst meal and service.",

All 4 entrees were ok and really subpar once you factor in price. The sides we had were mac and cheese, asparagus and saute mushrooms. All three were average at best. The service was the worst I have had at a so called high end restaurant. My wife ask for a refill of water 3 times, which she never got. The main server seemed very disinterested in waiting on our table. I can say with all certainty that the Striphouse at PH, Voodoo or Ramsey Steak are far better and a much better price than this place. This place made Outback look 5 star.",

    "text": "Like other modern Vegas steakhouses, Old Homestead is dark. It's also loud since the dining area opens up to the bar and a hallway within Caesars. And, like other steakhouses, you'll find typical dishes like beef tartare, tuna tartare, French onion soup, oysters, salads, a few seafood dishes, sides that are a la carte, and of course a variety of beef options.  There's nothing that really separates them from other steak places in town, but that's not necessarily a bad thing since I happen to enjoy most of the steakhouses I've been to. Although, they source their beef from Pat LaFrieda in NY (as does Gordon Ramsay's new place). That counts for something.  The bread basket had a variety of items in it, the best was the bacon cheddar roll. The crab cake ($23) lacked jumbo lump meat and was formed with mostly body meat and possibly some backfin meat. It did, however, pack a little kick from the roasted pepper aioli. The beef tartare ($22) could have used some of that, because it was rather bland.  For entrees, we decided to split the bone-in filet ($69, 16oz.), which they brought out on separate plates. The char was excellent and it was as tender as expected. The side of crab legs ($27) ordered with the filet consisted of one leg and a large pile of crab meat on the side with some drawn butter and half a lemon. It didn't look like much, but was plenty for the two of us. The roasted mushroom dish ($13) was also fabulous.  We still had room for dessert, so we opted for their carrot cake ($13). It was a large, traditional looking slice that could have fed four. The large chunks of walnuts in the cake added a nice contrast to the moist cake and mildly sweet (and creamy) icing. It was one of the better carrot cakes I've had in town and reason enough to return.  Prices are steep -- again, just like any other Vegas Steakhouse. But if you have your Caesar's/Harrah's Total Rewards card you can get a dollar or two off of each dish. The biggest issue I have with the price is that it's even more expensive than their New York restaurant. There's really no good reason for everything being more expensive. The crab cake, for example, if $5 more in Vegas than New York.  Another gripe is the reservation system. Old Homestead isn't on Open Table so you have to call their reservation line. The one listed on both the Old Homestead website and Caesar's Palace website wasn't working. I called numerous times over the course of an hour and the call would never go through. I had to call the hotel's room reservation line and they gave me a different number to use which worked. As an added hassle, they ask for a credit card number when you place your reservation.  The place may not be original, but that doesn't matter. Familiarity can be both comforting and satisfying and their dishes are just that -- items you've probably seen and tasted a million times. But at least they execute most of them well.",

Regardless we ordered a couple cocktails that were ok. I had the strawberry fields cocktail and my husband had a tequila/champagne cocktail. Just Ok. The lobster bisque soup totally made up for the cocktails.  It's a beautiful semi table side presentation. They give you a bowl of the shredded lobster and then pour the bisque into the bowls. It was rich and creamy and the lobster was great. By far the best lobster bisque I have ever tried. We also ordered the lobster Mac and cheese. It was extremely cheesy and very rich but whenever I see a lobster Mac on the menu I have to try it! Too rich for me. Old Homestead is also directly across from Nobu which makes it nearly impossible to ever pick over Nobu. Take the bait.....go to Nobu....",

    "text": "So, why the two star rating?  I've dine at many steakhouses and unfortunately Old Homestead Steakhouse FAILED me.    I was staying the weekend at Caesars Palace and was too exhausted to venture out so i decided to dine at Old Homestead Steakhouse.  I passed by it on my way to the Total Rewards counter to receive my monthly vouchers for shows.  I thought that the restaurant looked really nice and decided that i would dine here since I LOVE steak.   We were able to be seated quite quickly which was a plus.  Our server was also nice but a little slow.  He apologize saying that he had a large table to attend to yet the help was quick to clear our table when I still had food on my plate with the fork/knife in my hands.  Strange.  :(  Food:  Complimentary basket of bread with salted butter.  This was yummy.   **Thick-Cut Applewood Smoked Bacon (3 slices) $24; see photo **Rib Eye Steak 16 oz **Au Gratin Potatoes  The bacon was way too salty.  It's like they tried to season it but didn't sprinkle it all around evenly.  I did mention it to the server and instead of taking the 1 1/2 slices of extra SALTED pork, he says \"I'll give you a dessert instead to balance the taste.\"  Really?  Okay, I just told him that I did not like my $24 dish of 3 slices of bacon that was extra salty.  Whatever, I ordered it and I made mention to my server and I do hope he told the chef about it.  I also heard the table next to me return their calamari dish because that too was too salty.    So, now about the rib eye.  Yes, i eat a lot of meat and Rib Eye is one of my favorite cuts next to Porter House and Tomahawk.  I ordered it medium and it came out looking perfectly done.  Pink on the inside and charred on the outside.  I took a few bites and ummm NOPE... no flavor at all and typically when you bite into a steak you'd be able to savor and taste the meat. I started to wonder if my taste buds were altered because of the salted pork.  Regardless that the meat had no flavor, the meat was also chewy.  For a $68 steak, I could've gone to another restaurant instead and I wish I did.    Personally, I would not recommend this place or even dine here again.  They might've had an off night but after reading other reviews those reviews were not joking.",

I thought different toppings would taste better or none at all would've been better.  The sauteed mushrooms were amazing and buttery. My medium cooked filet mignon was soft as butter and a joy to eat. I also got a Russian Valley 2015 pinot noir which went well with the food.  I would recommend to others, but given the options for steakhouses in Las Vegas, would probably try something new next time, especially as this place isn't in the most luxurious surroundings.",

We ordered a drink at the bar first. The bartenders were nice and my cosmo was ok tasting. Once we were seated at our table. We ordered the crab cake appetizer. It was delicious and big enough for 2 people. Next we had the wedge salad. The size was decent but the dressing lacked flavor. They brought us a basket of bread. I took a bite of all and they were flavorless . For our main dish we ordered a 12 oz filet, medium, lobster Mac and cheese and shrimp scampi. The steak was a little over cooked and dry. The lobster Mac was disgusting. The cheese was weird tasting and it had some spicy red sauce on top. The shrimp scampi, large and was drench in sauce and tough. We didn't finish the salad, lobster Mac , shrimp or steak. Even though we tried. We needed up going up to our room and eating popcorn. The bill came to $185.  We don't mind paying that amount for good food. We were really disappointed and won't be returning.",

The only thing I thought was lacking was the oysters - \"Lollipop\" Rib Eye 38 oz. for Two - cooked to perfectly to temp, super flavorful and beefy! Definitely shareable  - Lobster Mac & Cheese - really rich and delicious, lots of chunk of lobster  - Cheddar Potato Gratin - Potato was really cheesy and delicious, however, next time I would only order one rich side, and something less rich to off balance the Mac & cheese  I would definitely recommend this place!",

We frequent steak houses around Las Vegas and always like to try a new one. This restaurant is way too loud, in fact I felt like we were dining at an airport. It's on the casino floor so lots of onlookers passing by, drunk obnoxious yelling.   Since it was only the two of us we felt neglected by the waiters. Big groups had all their attention and even the buser said sorry for the delay the waiter is busy. However once we received the check he came back quickly to receive the payment.   The food was decent but I probably won't be back, the description says it's a fancy restaurant but it's not all that. Lots of people were not dressed up.",

Listen, if I was stupid enough to spend another $200.00+ pp for a Vegas steak dinner, I'm at least smart enough to know that I wouldn't want to sit next to the bar where my table is sure to be jostled frequently.  The hostess told us that bar seating(one spot left, not conducive to relaxation and libation) was first come first served, and I told her that is another way to say \"piss off, we don't want your measly under $100.00 business\".

I was in the mood for Seafood, so I ordered the Pan seared Atlantic Salmon with Asian vegetables. My Sweetie once again ordered his usual which is out of this world, the Empire cut of prime rib on the bone.  My salmon melted in my mouth, so buttery and flavorful!   The prime rib will never let us down, talk about a mouth orgasm!!! I had a few bites of his and I was moaning in complete pleasure. The staff was worried at first however I am sure soon realized I was in a momentary state of Ecstasy upon the swivel of my mouth. My boyfriend nodded and whispered that I was OK, just enjoying the food.   Must have sides...Fried Calamari and homemade Tater Tots w/fat boy dipping sauce, it is sour cream, chives, cheese, and BACON mmmm yum!  I often dream about their tater tots, was so glad to get my fill. I have had a mad craving for these tasty golden nuggets of yum!  They have a rich and delicious mac and cheese, made with four different cheeses, mmm so good however would have been too much to order this time since the portions are so generous.   As always service is Top Notch! The ambiance is Wonderful! Food of course is always Incredible!  The menu is pricey, however you get what you pay for. This is a Classy Steakhouse and the portions are very generous! You will leave here stuffed, very full so come hungry!  Mmmmmm top things off with a Monster slice of big fat chocolate cake! Suck it silly that is one of the best cakes I have had the pleasure of tasting!!!  You won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "Meh. Considering the price and location, this meal should have been better. In Vegas, there are endless really good steakhouses. This isn't one of them. I can name other comparable nearby places that are far better (Craftsteak, Prime to name a few)  The service was good (not great) and the food was okay (not great). Come on people, this is a steakhouse in Caesar's Palace. Step it up. The bread basket had a nice variety of four different types of bread and came with salted butter. Sure, it's just a bread basket but it should have had more flavor and a higher quality of bread. I'm a carbaholic so the bread is kinda important to me.  The scallops were tasty and came with a nice sweet pea risotto. I appreciated that the risotto wasn't to saucy or creamy. This was probably the best dish of the meal. The Alaskan Halibut was nicely prepared, but was a skimpy portion of fish. One of my dining companions for the night could have had a second piece of halibut added to the plate for a more complete meal. We added sauteed spinach and asparagus. I prefer my asparagus to be slight (just slightly) more cooked. The spinach was ok. I probably should have just ordered it steamed instead of sauteed. The side veggie portions are shareable sizes. Lastly is the New York strip that was ordered off the bone. It's sad when you go to an expensive steakhouse and order a nice cut of meat just to find that it's mediocre. My dining companions were literally listing all the different places in Vegas and LA that had better steak (some weren't even steakhouses).   In the end, unless you get your meal comped.... go somewhere else for a better piece of meat.",

However, it was a bit too salty for me. Meanwhile my neighbor to my right offered me a taste of her huge calamari portion. After listening to her tell me how it was the best she had, I begged a bite or two and did not agree. I thought it was cooked very well but had a greasy taste. :(   I guess the old \"when in Rome\" should apply here...  Get the steak.",

We recently celebrated my husband's 40th birthday bash and we decided on the Vault, which is a private banquet room in the Old Homestead. In the vault, it is an intimate room where you can smoke a cigar and have one of the best steaks you have ever eaten. We had a party of 12 people, and the customer service levels were top NOTCH. The steaks, the sides, the food and the ambiance was a memory my husband will never forget. We even hired a mariachi 2 person band to liven up the party and it was a magical night full of laughter and full belly's! David and his team ensured my husband felt special and went above and beyond by even addressing a \"Happy Birthday Dennis\" on his menu, which everyone had signed a little memo for him. He now has this framed in his office as this memory will never be forgotten. He even had a personalized video for him upon entering the room. To David Chiti and his amazing team- THANK YOU- for all you did for us. For one of the best meals we've had in a long time and to top notch customer service- we will come every year we are in Vegas for a scrumptious steak dinner at your venue. Wish we could give more than 5 stars. Simply one of the best!!",

    "text": "This year my parents decided to ditch cooking and have Thanksgiving in Vegas. It ended up just being them, my boyfriend and me, and my best friend who had Thanksgiving dinner at Old Homestead Steakhouse.   We had reservations so we were seated right away. We had the most awesome waiter ever...I wish I remembered his name so I could give him a shout out! He made our dining experience great, my dad even asked him to sit down and have a drink with us since we liked him so much! He didn't, but it would have been fun.  This place was great! And the prices were pretty reasonable, between all the food we ordered and multiple cocktails, our bill was only $400 after my 10% off Yelp check in offer and the fact that we got the Total Rewards Pricing. That is not bad for a nice steakhouse!  We ordered....  Garlic Bread (two orders of it actually) - This is not typical garlic bread. It is served on a huge plate, with light, airy pieces of toast stacked up on one end, and the entire bottom of the plate is filled with a delicious garlicky Alfredo type sauce to dip the toast in. Brilliant idea, very tasty.  French Onion Soup - My boyfriend and friend ordered this. Very rich, lots of sherry, great cheese on top, loaded with onions. I really enjoyed this.  Maine Lobster Bisque - This was the only letdown of the meal for me. Instead of large pieces of lobster, there was a small round of minced lobster in the bottom of the bowl, then the bisque was poured over that. The lobster itself tasted good, but the bisque was too fishy and there was something missing. We never figured out what it was, but both my stepmom and I ordered this, and neither of us cared for this much.   Porterhouse Steak for Three - The four of them decided they wanted to split the Porterhouse. My stepmom had been to this restaurant before and she said they could get the Porterhouse for two, and it would be enough for the four of them. My men didn't believe her, so they ordered the steak for three. Good lord! I wish I was able to get a picture of that steak, but the servers dish it out to everybody as soon as it arrives. That thing was MASSIVE! And my stepmom was right, there was steak leftover. If I had decided to have the Porterhouse as well, the portion for three people would have easily fed all five of us. And it's such a good deal, only $142 which worked out to $35 per person. I highly recommend getting that steak, it was tasty and very affordable.   8 oz Petite Filet - I ordered this Medium with a side of Truffle Butter. It was definitely a bit rarer than Medium, but it was good. They give you enough Truffle Butter to pass around, there was probably as much butter as there was steak. Very rich, very decadent, a perfect steak for me!  Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes - Good, but nothing special. Very simple mashed potatoes.  Tater Tots with Fat Boy Sauce - The tots were great, they had a nice consistency, the dipping sauce was some sort of sour cream mixture with huge pieces of thick cut bacon mixed in. I liked these.   Mac & Four Cheeses - A very good, but simple, Mac and Cheese.   Cauliflower Gratin - Awesome roasted cauliflower with cheese. I think this was my favorite side, we should have ordered two of these, as the sides are pretty small and there was definitely not enough of all five of us to have a lot of the gratin.  As I stated before, the service was impeccable. We never waited for anything, our waiter was constantly bringing us more cocktails and wine, refills on water never took long. The ambiance in this restaurant was nice, very dark, and they were playing lounge covers of 90's pop songs, which I found funny. I would definitely come back to this steakhouse when I am in Vegas, especially for that Garlic Bread!",

We had the seared foie gras, shrimp cocktail( the shrimp was huge), both the east and west oysters(west side oysters are a bit smaller but very creamy and sweet), and for the main entree we had the rib eye and prim rib. I highly recommend the ribeye, it's very tender and juicy.  The service was friendly and the waiter was very professional helping us out with the food selections.  Well, just a must try :)",

I asked for it to be rare and I loved the meal.   Very filling and perfect.   The steak probably should of been pulled a min earlier to be truly rare but that's my only \"negative\".   Little pricy as that plate set my back $110 but like I said, wanted to splurge. I would go back for sure.",

Now onto the food, we ordered:  *a cocktail - I don't remember the name of it but it was sparkly and had a blackberry in it, it was pretty tasty.  *fresh oysters - you can't go wrong with fresh shucked oysters  *the Gotham ribeye - they were kind enough to split in for us, the meat itself was nice and tender but lacking in flavor *roasted mushrooms - good but had a vinegar aftertaste  *lobster mac n cheese - decent  Overall, the food was good but nothing to write home about. For the price that you pay, I'm sure you can get a better steak elsewhere in Vegas.",

My girlfriend and I stopped in to Old Homestead for a pre-Elton John dinner, celebrating a new promotion at work.  Food- You can't go wrong with these amazing steaks... I ordered the 'Gotham' Ribeye (cooked medium rare to perfection) and my girl ordered the Filet Mignon (also cooked medium rare.)  We shared a lobster Mac & Cheese.  This amount was perfect for the two of us and we left 100% satisfied.  Ambience- Quaint, tucked in Caesars Palace right around the corner from Cleopatra's barge- very close to the Collosseum.  Perfect for our pre-show meal!  Service-  Our waiter was kind and patient, answering all of our questions and making sure our drinks were constantly re-filled.  His suggestions on wine to enjoy with our meal were spot-on.   5 Stars...  A must-stop when you're in Caesars Palace!",

Located in the middle of Caesars across from nobu. Has kind of an old classic steakhouse feel, open but still quiet and intimate.  Started with the seafood platter for two, but got everything but the oysters warmed and it was great. Massive king crab and jumbo oysters, decent piece of lobster and I think a half dozen small oysters. Prolly the best thing I recognized was no fishiness taste or smell at all, I know that can be a real turn off for a lot of people. Very well done though.  Next we shared the 24oz Gotham ribeye, medium rare. Cooked perfectly and had a really nice sear on it. Definitely enough for two smaller people. Got mac and cheese to go with it. Pretty good, super cheesy doe, maybe a lil too much cheese if that's possible.   Finished off by overeating / ordering and got the banana bread pudding, pretty solid, but not worth getting if you are full. Probably could have done without.   Also had a half bottle of wine. All in, with tip, this will run you around $300. Kind of on par with nicer places in Vegas. Definitely would recommend to others.",

    "text": "My family and I reserved some seats here because Nobu was way too packed. We ordered six dishes and some drinks. The bill came out to be around $320. The six dishes that we ordered were: 16 oz bone-in filet, 16 oz ribeye, Scottish salmon, lobster mac and cheese, truffle mashed potatoes, and the OH burger. I didn't get the opportunity to try every dish that we ordered, but the ones that I did try were good, but not $320 good. The lobster mac and cheese and truffle mashed potatoes that I ordered were delightful. One thing I will say is that the steaks that we ordered seemed to be undercooked. The filet was meant to be medium and the other was meant to be medium rare. They looked to be a little more pink than my family liked and borderline bloody in some parts, but we ate it anyway.   The service was okay. They messed up on the drinks that we ordered, but I wasn't too bothered about that. My boyfriend and my cousin ordered regular Pepsi. Yet, they returned with diet, which I politely asked if they could fix it. They apologized and promptly came back with the correct drinks. However, this isn't the reason why the service was just \"okay.\" Towards the beginning, the server that we had was very attentive. After ordering our food, he disappeared for awhile. This was a problem because my family wanted some condiments for the dishes that we ordered. It took us about a good 5-10 minutes to ask another server because no one paid attention to our table, despite all of us saying \"excuse me\" to several workers that walked by. I understand that it gets busy during dinner time. However, flat out ignoring the customer is just plain rude. A simple \"one moment, please\" would have sufficed.   Overall, I'd say that my experience here was just okay. It wasn't terrible, but I don't think I would come back here again.",

Apparently \"duck fat fries\" is a gimmick. McDonald's fries better. Turned out they don't take Caesars employee discount on weekends like the other restaurants at Caesars do but we had already ordered so too late to back out.  We were eating at 4:00 just after they opened and place was empty but still wouldn't honor the discount. Took a long time to be seated for some reason and we had reservations and they weren't busy. Hostess sat us along the open air to the casino where it was noisy and smokey. She said she was giving us their favorite table but there were a whole row of booths just like it...   $45 burger was good but Five Guys burger better for $10. My date said the salmon tasted too buttery . She didn't like it and she loves fish.   Waiter was pleasant but kept asking \"is everything wonderful!\" he was so chipper about it I didn't have heart to tell him no.   Best part of the meal was the bread.   Better steaks and ambiance and price across the street at Ruth Chris's at Bally's and they always honor the employee discount.",

The pricing is definitely high which is expected in Vegas but I would say it's borderline worth it. Wait staff is phenomenal though and it's very well set up. I would recommend it. The main reason it's not a 4/5 for me is simply the value for what you get. $70 for two king crab legs although good is a little steep.",

The atmosphere is perfect, the background music enjoyable, and the entire staff are pleasant and helpful. I had a ribeye that was cooked to absolute perfection, along with asparagus, lobster mac and cheese and a mashed potato side. Everything was amazing..then dessert...OMG best chocolate cake ever...and I'm a baker, so...I'm not embarrassed to say I finished it in my room at 1 a.m without the availability of a fork. The friends that joined us also had a superb time and were quite impressed. I HIGHLY recommend this place, we've been coming for several years and it just gets better and better.",

We ordered the Oysters Rockefeller, the lollipop ribeye for two, truffle butter gnocchi (highly recommend), and the Mac n cheese. Everything was cooked to perfection. The steak melted in our mouth and was delicious. Ramon, our waiter, was attentive and the restaurant had an elegant ambiance without being over the top. For my birthday they bought out a creme brulee desert which was also very good. Overall, I would definitely return next time we're in Vegas.",

    "text": "I dined at Old Homestead Steakhouse with my husband and another couple on a weekday evening. We arrived a little late for our reservation (but had called from the room to let them know) and we were seated promptly.   Unfortunately, I was not impressed with the service provided for an upscale steakhouse on the Strip, because our server never took our entree order! We all ordered appetizers to start, a dozen oysters for the ladies, a shrimp cocktail and a wedge salad for the gentlemen.   When our waiter came back to ask if we needed anything else, and we all looked surprised that he wasn't asking for our entree orders, and then he said that the kitchen was CLOSED. Thankfully the situation was rectified, but it took a member of our party getting slightly demanding to make it happen.   The food was decent, my filet was well cooked, my friend's lamb was excellent. The sides (mashed potatoes, asparagus, creamed spinach with bacon) were nothing to write home about.  There are too many places in Las Vegas where you receive top notch service for me to bother returning to Old Homestead anytime soon.  Yelp Reviews 2018 40/100",

    "text": "I wasn't going to write a review, but someone recently said they came here and it reminded me of my experience here the other night.  I came here on a date with my girl and I ordered the 16 oz. Ribeye. I had to send the first one back because it was overcooked, then the waiters said they \"stole another one for me off another table\" which was pretty odd. The second steak was practically all fat, my date agreed. So I had to send that one back too.  By the time the third steak came out, I took a bite of it and I have to say: I have made better steaks and I'm not even a chef. I am not exaggerating. The meat quality was very tough, the steak didn't cut well without some real downward force. I ate three bites and was just like \"forget it, this isn't even worth it\".  The key takeaway is this, Homestead: if you're going to charge $80 for a steak, it damn well better blow people away, and not on the third attempt either. If you can't meet a minimum standard of quality level, then you should not be charging that price range. I could have gone to Capital Grille and got a 15-year aged balsamic ribeye for $60 and it would've destroyed this.  The waiter didn't take it off the bill either. Truly a subpar experience and a subpar level of service. Date said the lobster bisque was \"okay\", the oysters were good. But the steak absolutely ruined it. Two solid thumbs down.",

First of all, every single dish we ordered was warm, not hot. What steakhouse doesn't bring out their steak on a hot sizzling plate? My filet was served on a boring cold white plate. I ordered a side of mushrooms, mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. Every single side dish was also just \"warm\". My friend got the 10oz filet with a $60 lobster tail and he only took 2 bites out of the lobster because it was absolutely disgusting. My French onion soup was also just warm. Perhaps my taste buds are just tailored towards excellent food, maybe that's why I thought the food served here was utterly disgusting. I will never be back here, and I'm very disappointed I wasted my time and money in this cold/dank dungeon of a restaurant. Oh I forgot to mention, if you wish to use the restroom you have to walk our all the way back to the casino floor.",

We also had the creamed spinach and mashed potatoes. Decent as well, but not the best I've had.   For dessert we had the creme brulee once again good but not the best I've had.

We started things off with the foie gras on top of a waffle and I've never had it before but it was definitely a mouthful. Ordered the filet mignon and I gotta admit that it's up there with other top Vegas steakhouses as far as steaks go!",

I myself had the no bone NY med rare and my friend ordered the no bone ribeye med rare.  For sides we got asparagus and the lobster mash.  Overall it was  I was pretty happy with the food.  Nothing super fantastic but a solid effort.  My steak was good and seasoned nicely and the asparagus was cooked but crisp and the lobster mash was good.    Overall a nice ambiance, the wait staff was excellent, and nice eye candy up front.    I'd almost go 4 star but they have several tables lined up along this hallway that seem a little awkward to be sitting at (which of course is where we sat).    A solid effort and a place that I will most likely dine at again.",

The key that makes it overpriced is that all the meat is served a la cart. meaning meat on plate-that's it. I watch what I eat, so I tend to stay away from carbs, but I have never seen other higher end places that serve steaks this way. I ordered the sauteed spinach with my steak ($60 for a 16 oz. ribeye) and it was $14.00 . My goodness. the meat was pretty good, but definitely not the best, or $60 good. I felt I could have gone to a \"less fancy\" steakhouse, had a delicious steak for a little less and they would have probably served it with a couple of sides. The service was ok, nothing to brag about, but it was just ok. I will not spend over $100 again for meat, spinach and one drink.",

    "text": "A NYC steakhouse institution.  You better heed and respect that when you dine here else fuggeddaboutit.  Established in 1868, it has become upscale everyday dining for decision makers or those with large expense accounts.  It is not a romantic fine dining or family centric restaurant.  Without insulting anyone, the Old Homestead also has the hurried ambiance / attitude of NYC.  Close tables, prompt but abrupt service, a \"I don't waste your time, don't waste mine\" type of vibe.  Classic NYC.  It might not suit everyone.  You've been warned.  For starters, the classics shine.  Oysters Rockefeller is delicious.  Just warmed through oyster topped with the essence of bacon, spinach and a rich bernaise sauce.  One dimensional creaminess with a flavor explosion.  The Maryland crab cake is equally good.   More filler than most contemporary crab cakes but it works.  The filler soaks up the crab juices to create a milder crab flavor with a heightened crab perfume.  Deeply browned crust adds texture.  The accompanying red pepper aioli just works.  Steaks are excellent.  USDA top Prime.  Well trimmed.  Well aged.  Outstanding sear.  Huge cuts (18oz New York, 26oz \"Gotham Rib\", 16 oz Filet Mignon).  The signature 16oz bone in filet  is outstanding.  Very thick cut (almost two inches thick) with a  beautiful sear and even cooking.  Makes your mouth all kinds of happy if you cut through the entire piece and enjoy the contrasting temperature, juiciness, and flavors of the full thickness of the piece.  Light beef flavor.  Mild umame.  The Gotham Rib has a much more pronounced beefy flavor.  Excellent in its own way.  More than enough for two.  Sides are traditional.  Not as large as you might expect from a steakhouse but still sharable.  Creamed spinach and home made tater tots are as good as any.  Outstanding wine list focusing on US producers.  Vegas resort pricing.  Tip:  Bring your Total Rewards card for a 1-5 percent discount on the menu.  Tier does not matter.  If you have the chops, there's some great food to be had at the Old Homestead.",

So finally we were able to try the Old Homestead Steakhouse & I gotta admit it was a small let down.  The service was very good, not exceptional but good enough to not complain. The food was just okay. We were part of a 8 person party so between all of us we pretty much sampled the majority of the menu.   I had the Calamari for my appetizer & for my steak I ordered the Rib Eye. The calamari was just way too much for an \"appetizer\" & not very flavorful. The steak...meh, I've had much better Rib Eye's from Mortons, to Ruth Chris & Maestro's here in CA. Even Delmonico's in the Venetian was just leaps & bounds better. It's not that the food was terrible or bad, it was okay but not on the same level nor on a level I'd expect from Caesars?? The food here was more like Mirage or Treasure Island etc. but not a premier hotel like Caesars or Bellagio or Venetian.   But hey, I wanted to try it & I did & all in all it was a great trip & the food like I said was \"okay\". But definitely a \"let down\". I expected to be blown away but nope not here.",

At our table of six, two of us order the fillet mignon and found them Both over cooked. I had ordered mine rare and it came out with barely a hint of pink in the middle (it was darker than another guest at our table who ordered his med-rare and was also over cooked).  The sides we ordered - potatoes, lobster mac, spinach, and mushrooms - were unimpressive to both the eye and tastebuds.  Bright spot for the food was the appetizers we ordered but, after a table bill that was over a grand, we all just kind of left shrugging. For all the hype that goes into this steakhouse, our experience was that something has just obviously gone wrong in that kitchen -- which is a real shame.  As frustrating as the dining experience was, it was upsetting that we could have gone to any of many other excellent restaurants on the strip that night but missed the opportunity because of our visit to Old Homestead. Maybe we'll try whatever the next restaurant moves into that space in the future.",

They cut loose with us, never let a glass go empty, and seemed to all have fun, all while providing premier service. It's not the super stuffy/fancy, can't relax type place.

WhiLe passing through Caesar's Palace toward the forum shops we saw a dinner special sign at Old Homestead Steakhouse.  It was a lobster special for two, which comes with soup or salad and fries.    They brought us a nice bread basket with butter. We split a four pound lobster and there was nice chunk of meat.  Also, it came with two small pieces of corn on the cob. My husband loved his French onion soup and my Caesar salad was good.    This was not exactly a light meal we expected but it was wonderful.  Service was excellent.   We will definitely be back here to try other foods on the menu, especially seared foie gras.",

    "text": "I avoided reviewing this restaurant, hoping that their management would get back to me, but it's been two weeks I haven't heard back. This was our unfortunate experience.  My colleague and I were staying at the Mirage and planned on having dinner at STK at the Cosmo on Monday (12/18) night. However, the night before (Sunday) we had an amazing experience at Nobu at Caesars. Amazing meal and whiskeys... and Toshi, our bartender, was spectacular. We had the Chef's tasting menu... remarkable. While walking out, we saw the Old Homestead Steakhouse restaurant and one of their hostesses encouraged us to dine there the following night, and that we would have a similarly, amazing meal if we came back.   So, we changed our plans from STK, and dined at there. This is where, unfortunately our experience paled in comparison to our evening at Nobu:  1) First, there were plenty of tables open, but my colleague and I were seated in the walkway to their kitchen where severs used this path all night. The door swung opened consistently distracting from the ambience. This was not ideal to have good conversation... but tolerable since we were looking forward to the great steak meal that was boasted.  2) Our waiter Rocky was wonderful. He had great suggestions and information about the food and drinks. Very accommodating. Also, the gentlemen that brought us our bread and waters was very attentive and professional (I didn't get his name, but stellar). But, after we submitted our orders, we waited almost an hour to be served. There was a gentlemen that was seated after we ordered, and he received his appetizer, and full meal before ours. Another couple that was seated after us, also received their meal before us. This seemed a bit odd. But we were patient and didn't allow it to ruin our anticipation.  3) Once we received our food, everything was good again. We didn't mind the area we were seated in, nor that it took quite some time. The food was delicious... including the two cappuccinos to end the meal with. We left content and satisfied. This was our last night in Vegas, so we had a lot planned. However, a few hours into the night my colleague became quite nauseated and ill. We rushed back to the room where he experienced severe stomach cramping, vomiting and diarrhea.  I thought that he possibly caught a bug or something, until I started to experience the same symptoms.  We both ordered the Gotham and shared the Asparagus, and Truffle Mashed Potatoes; so we can't help but figure that we were served something that caused food poisoning given the timing and severity.  Needless to say, our last night in Vegas was spent in our rooms, and our travels back to Los Angeles were quite cumbersome, with frequent and challenging stops.  All of these three things simply added up into why I decided to email the manager, Mr. Hitoshi Yuhara... who I still haven't heard from. I would truly appreciated a response to our very unfortunate experience. It was quite disappointing, and even more so since it ruined all of our plans for our final night in Vegas.  ---UPDATE---  I've changed by rating from a 1-Star to 2-Star since Mr. Hitoshi Yuhara contacted me. I'm looking forward to resolving the experience we had.",

    "text": "Indulging on every level...  We left wobbling out of here and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves! We were also fortunate enough to be sat in a private room that wasn't being used with just a few other tables as I noticed that this place is insanely loud. Whether you're on the main dining side or near the bar, everything is open to the casino and the noise level is extremely loud. Just something to keep in mind when you're coming here and for what reason.   Our food was very satisfying. From the perfectly cooked filets to the room temperature butter that was doused with EVOO...as one thing after another came out we just couldn't stop eating! Here are a few details -  The meat was flavorful and we tried the potato gratin and creamed spinach with bacon. Both sides were perfect. My kitchen sink salad with champagne vinaigrette was also great and you can customize it if there's anything you don't like as I did. Caesar salad was ok, nothing special. If you decide to indulge on the seafood be prepared for colossal shrimp. They were as large as my hand and looked like lobster tails! We also splurged on trying all the steak sauces and I'm glad we did because there wasn't one we didn't enjoy! My new thing is to also add caramelized onions to any steak on the side which we did here and again it just all went together perfectly!  It's pricey but we did enjoy nearly everything and the only thing I wouldn't order again was the Caesar.   Service was very friendly and tentative and overall we loved it! We were so stuffed we didn't even have room for dessert!",

    "text": "Trying to get back into writing reviews... so here we go..  I want to start with saying that I had the most amazing time here. Almost one year ago I went to the original location in New York City, and although the food was alright, I had the worst service. And to give you an idea as to how bad the waiter was, he counted our 20% tips at the table while still making a disappointed \"ugh\" sound while reading the check. How unbelievable was that?  But this Caesars Palace location was amazing, although noisy, is nice with a great lively atmosphere. I wouldn't recommend this place for an intimate romantic dinner. I made reservations on OpenTable, but ended up stopping by the restaurant a couple of days before to request a seating somewhere behind the Host stand, as the seating up against the front of the restaurants puts you right up against a hallway of people walking to and from the different casino areas of Caesars. I don't like that area as you have people slowing their step to take look at what's on your table, or even worse, stopping to take in a good look.  We started with a round of Grey Goose Martini's perfectly made. I had regular olives while my guests had blue cheese stuffed ones. The Crab Cakes were presented well, but tasted too fishy, and had a mustard sauce that is good enough for any hot dog. I don't think I would order the crab cakes again.  The Ribeye which I had was cooked PERFECTLY, and was so juicy. I don't remember if they offered any sauce, or topping!!! One of my guests had lobster which was overcooked and hard to chew, while my other guest had the bone-in-filet and from what they said, was cooked and tasted to their liking.   This was paired with a wonderful Cabernet Sauvignon (Cakebread from Napa Valley) for the price, which I would recommend springing for. Not necessarily that bottle, although I plan on ordering it again, but for the reason that each bottle ends up yielding around 4-5 glasses which you would ordinarily pay around $20-$30 for. You end up cutting a little off your bill ordering that way.   Good Job Old Homestead.... despite my experience in NYC, you certainly won my business back. Can't wait to visit on my next trip",

    "text": "Omg! I can't believe people write mean reviews about this place. I recently moved to Vegas and was highly recommeded by the Valet attendant while going to the Shania Twain show. My server was Jesse, a nice and genuine guy. He actually offered to seat us while helping the hostess at the door. Our cocktails came fast, we had couple cosmos to start and the martini glass was huge! The manager came to our table and besides the greeting, offered us to try a bottle of Flowers Pinot Noir. His description was perfect and the wine tasted just like he said: big wine, not oakie, candy cherry and juicy. We felt like home! The blue crab cake was chunky and perfectly seared with absolutely no grease at all on the bottom, even though, I am sure there is mayo there. Jesse was on point all night. Checking on us in a friendly matter every other 5 to 10 minutes. We took his recommendation and had a Gotham Ribeye and Lamb Chops... Expect big fillets and for sides the gnocchi with truffle butter was unbeateable. Oh, for dessert, their Chocolate Chip cookie with vanilla ice cream comes in a collosal size with roasted almonds, white and dark chocolate,with caramel and chocolate sauce.... I am coming back after work as soon as I get paid again. Surely not cheap, but food and service are tottally worthy the experience... btw, the space is very open like a NY train station, at least that is what resembles me, by the pictures framed in the wall, however cozy, specially if you seat inside their private room, there is a wine cellars you can see from inside that room.",

Our waiter, Matt did a good job serving us. My wife and I each ordered a Cosmopolitan. $15, excellent! Bread basket, excellent! My wife ordered petite filet mignon and lobster tail, $90. I ordered bone in filet mignon,$66. Both were outstanding! Desserts sent us over the top. She had chocolate chip cookie and ice cream. I had big fat chocolate cake. We could not finish dessert. Too much food.  And we shared the meal with our eight year old grandaughter. Bill was well north of $200. Plus a $50 tip for excellent service. We also purchased a photo taken by a professional photographer working in the restaurant, $45. Meal was expensive but what do you expect, it's Vegas! Meal was well worth it.

We were seated near the entrance, which was loud, but that's the only negative. The service was quick - we ordered blue cheese lettuce wedges, Jumbo shrimp cocktail to start off with. Pricey, but let me tell you, it is truly jumbo shrimp. My goodness, I had no idea shrimp could be that big. We both ordered Swordfish for dinner with roasted mushrooms and mac n cheese.   Im telling you the swordfish was huge, and cooked to perfection. My wife couldn't eat it all. The mushrooms and mac n cheese come out family style in their own hot pans. They were a great compliment to the meal. We couldn't eat it all there was so much.  Spent about $200 for dinner and a drink. This place is worth a try if you are looking for a great dinner in a nice casino.",

This restaurant is located in the space previously occupied by Nero's steak house for many many years. I prefer Nero's and in Tampa Bern's. They both beat Old Homestead by a country mile. It is overpriced and over rated. Having been born and raised in  East Harlem I never heard of Old Homestead, but again I had never heard of Mac Donalds either. However, I know a good steak and a good price, and Old Homestead does not deliver.",

    "text": "***The steak at Old Homestead Steakhouse in Caesars Palace is decent, but you will have much better steaks (as well as much better sides) at Mario Batali's Carnevino in The Palazzo***  Old Homestead seems to be a relatively new steakhouse in Caesars Palace.  It is located along that narrow stretch of walkway that connects two parts of the casino (the one area with Mesa Grill and the casino area more towards the hotel lobby).  The decor at Old Homestead is definitely dark, but it is actually not as dark (or as old-school) as what you will find in many of the pricey steakhouses in Las Vegas.  The restaurant feels smaller, more open and even a little more contemporary.  We had a special 3-course fixed menu, which included a choice of salad, an entree with sides and an assortment of some of the restaurant's desserts.  The two salad choices were a caesar salad and their kitchen sink salad.  The kitchen sink salad (my choice) consisted of shrimp, salami, bacon, avocado, tomato, hearts of palm, blue cheese, and a vinaigrette.  The salad was decent.  The balance of the ingredients was not that great and some of the salad was a little underdressed, but the overall flavor was satisfying enough.  Their entree dishes included a chicken, fish and sirloin dish.  I opted for the sirloin au poivre, which was topped with a peppercorn sauce.  There was a garnish of Yukon gold mashed potatoes.  Sirloin is definitely not the most expensive cut of beef, but the preparation here was good.  The sirloin had a nice sear and there was a decent marbling of fat, which gave the meat a fair amount of juiciness (which can be tough with a sirloin).  The meat was tender too and flavorful.  The peppercorn sauce was quite aggressive.  It made the dish a little too peppery.  The side of Yukon gold mashed potatoes was fine.  There was also a decent breadbasket with many different choices including a pretzel roll.  Desserts are typically not that special at steakhouses.  They tend to be old-fashioned and heavy desserts and that was the case here.  There was a key lime pie topped with an Italian meringue and it was actually refreshing, tart, creamy, and decent.  I did not try the New York Style Cheesecake, but I did try their Big Fat Chocolate Cake, which was a chocolate layer cake with ganache.  It was not that great--dense and not that great of a flavor (kind of something you could get anywhere).  Service was good.  The staff was friendly and the food came out at a good pace.  Prices were high like other high-end Las Vegas steakhouses.  Old Homestead is a decent place for a big and juicy steak on The Strip.  I prefer Carnevino to Old Homestead, but I would take Old Homestead over chain places like Smith & Wollensky, The Palm and Ruth's Chris (which is located just off The Strip).  It is not a great steak restaurant, but it is an okay one.  Like other Las Vegas casinos on The Strip, Caesars Palace offers both free self and valet parking.",

From the amazing porterhouse steak, the excellent wines, the personable and attentive service), the deliciously unique bacon appetizer special, and everything else in between Old Homestead is one of the top steak houses I've been to (and I've been to countless steak houses the world over).  This is a True steakhouse for a True steak-eating man who knows how to appreciate his meat.  Glad Old Homestead is only a 1.5 hour flight away from home because it's not easy catching a flight to Uruguay or the tip of southern Argentina for an outstanding steak and steakhouse experience.",

    "text": "Don't get me wrong, the food was good but for the price, I expected better quality. I guess the service made up for it.  I went to Old Homestead on my last trip to Vegas almost half a year ago and went to Old Homestead for the first time. It was a big group of us, maybe about 20 people, and everyone was pleased. I had the filet mignon, it was cooked perfectly.  I figured I'd try something different this time so I splurged a little and had the 5oz Japanese Wagyu (somewhere around $150). I asked for no pepper on it. It's not an allergy, just a strong dislike. I was hoping that when someone ordered a bit of a nicer cut that they would pay more attention to the requests but I ended up scraping the pepper off in the end. My fault, I could've sent it back but I didn't want to be THAT butt. It was good and all but I've had Japanese Wagyu before and it was definitely more tender than the piece I had. You definitely need to order a side with the Wagyu as it is extremely marbled and very rich if you have it on it's own. Again, it was cooked perfectly so I guess I have to give them credit for 2 perfect steaks out of 2.  My mom had the King Crab legs and finished them happily but all she could say was they were good but she'd had better. Stick to the steak at the steak house but if you want seafood, their seafood tower was very satisfying on the first visit.  Finally, dessert! Hot cookie in a skillet with a giant ball of ice cream and a Creme Brulee. Two very happy desserts to end the night. Nothing amazingly out of the ordinary but very pleasing!  We had a great waiter so that made all the difference. Unfortunately, I can't remember his name but he was a man! Maybe that'll narrow it down for you.",

    "text": "If you compare this place to other Steakhouses in Vegas...it's just not worth the price. I'll tell you why!!   I wanted to use my comps at a good steakhouse in Caesars...so, we decided to try Old Homestead without looking at the menu. It was just my wife and I...we asked how long the wait was...the host said they can accommodate us in 15 minutes. We grabbed a spot at the bar and noticed their was a 2-top table available the whole time we sat at the bar. After 35 minutes, I walked over to the hostess and asked when our table was going to be ready. Sure enough, they said in a few minutes and proceeded to sit us at the same table I was looking at for 35 minutes. Ugh. They sat us without menus. I had to get up and ask the Maitre D for menus.   Our waiter finally came over. I asked his recommendations and I said give me a few minutes...he took 15 minutes to get back to me. By this time I'm starving. I ordered the 16ounce bone in Filet and my wife ordered the 8 ounce filet medium well. We added asparagus and mashed potatoes. The prices are very high. He assured us bread was on the way. The bread didn't come and I had to ask again.   The food came in about 40 minutes and my wife's steak was undercooked and bloody. We waited for a while before he came back to check on us. We sent her bloody meat back for a medium well cook. She really wanted to eat it...but, it was too rare. They cooked the steak to her liking...but, it was still red. The food was good...but, no great. I expect something great for a $69.00 steak.   All in all, we waited forever for the bill. The ambiance was lame. SW steakhouse at the Wynn is wayyyyyyyyyy better for the same price and they have a water show on the \"Lake of Dreams\" every 30 min.   Go to SW!!! It's the best in Vegas!! This place sucks!",

So..ambience is nice...think dark wood paneling, granite, very upscale inside. Service is what you would expect...top notch.   They first brought out a container of various breads, which were delicious. Finally, we got down to business.  Oysters Rockefeller were seriously amazing. One of the better items on the menu without a doubt.   I ordered bacon and a chopped salad (don't ask), which I shared with my friend. The bacon! Oh my god! It's approximately 1/4\" thick and delicious. Highly recommended.   Chopped salad was delicious.  My brother got the filet mignon, which was tender enough to cut with a fork.   Sorry for the simple review but we really didn't explore the menu so to speak. All in all it was very good and I wouldn't hesitate to go back.",

It was so delicious and fresh!   We all had caprese salads--it was by far the best I've had anywhere. There's something to be said for the most amazing, soft cheese that is used.   We had Gotham Ribeye steaks for dinner...so juicy, tender and flavorful. Cooked to perfection..I couldn't have done it better myself. The side dishes were plenty to share, and they were hot and delicious too! Sides are often a \"last thought\" at steakhouses, but not here.   We shared desserts, because at this point  we were all stuffed! But we weren't disappointed with those either.   From start to finish this was one of the most memorable meals I've had. Will we go back? Absolutely!! I raved about this dinner for days afterward and look forward to our next visit.",

I apologize for the upcoming sarcasm:  After exploring Caesar's Palace for a bit and perusing the menu from the hostess, my friends and I settled on this place. It was about 7:30 on a Sunday, the restaurant was practically empty. The hostess took our name and made us wait five minutes. She proceeded to talk with the other hostess, flirt with someone, and stand there doing nothing while we waited. Red flag #1: waiting that long to be seated in an empty restaurant.  We're seated. And left to sit there with no water or bread for another five minutes. Water comes by. Oh yay water! Then the waiter comes by. We tell him we're ready to order. But he wasn't ready to take our order. This makes sense how?  He just stops by to say hi and give us a drink menu.  We're left to wait for another 5-10 minutes before the bread comes. If the bread didn't come any sooner, I was going to complain because I hadn't eaten all day and reallly could have used some form of sustenance. Keep in mind this is all in a nearly empty restaurant. No apologies regarding the bread or the water.  Our waiter comes by and, joy, he's now ready to take our order! We should feel so lucky! He takes our order. A bus boy actually comes by to ask us if we want more bread. I was so surprised by this and we welcomed it because we were famished.  Like all other reviews say, the bread basket is freaking good. Variety and its all tasty (even soft pretzel sticks. yum).  Given all the waiting we already did, our food came surprisingly fast. Honestly my sense of timing is off from all the waiting we did and my hunger, so the food either came quick or at the normal pace one would expect.  Our waiter never checked on us. He checked on tables around us. He chatted with them, mucked it up, had a blast. Who cares if we're enjoying our meal though, right?  Onto the food: the crab cakes are delicious, the mac n cheese side is in fact heavenly, the kobe burger is too (uhhh pricey though, sorry, I can get an infinitely better burger in Chicago for $5-$20), filet mingon is delicious. Everything is very good. Combine this with the service and price, beyond not worth it. If we received good service, I suppose that would negate the price, because you know, when you're spending this much money, you expect to be treated well. I wanted to chalk this up to the sticker shock of Vegas, but I was treated much better at different venues.",

    "text": "Came here on Saturday 9PM and were fortunate enough to find a table for 6 without a reservation as the restaurant was quite busy. So, reservations would probably be the best bet. The decor was simple and classy. Our booth was lit up beautifully which, sometimes, is an attribute missed on by many steakhouses with dark lighting on the restaurant floor. Now, the food.   First, I would say that the sides at Old Homestead in themselves deserve 5 stars. They are absolutely that good! The fried calamari was tender and fresh. Lobster bisque was so rich, creamy, and full of flavor. DO NOT MISS OUT on the CRAB CAKES, ROASTED CORN, and GNOCCI w/TRUFFLE. The crab cake is stacked high with fluffy light crab meat and seared in with a delicious crispy crunch. The Roasted corn had some combination of jicama and spices, all of which tickle the your tastebuds and leave a nice little kick of fire. My favorite side was the Gnocci. Each bite was perfectly soft (not overly chewy) that melts in your mouth as the flavor of the white truffle permeates your pallet.   Steaks we had were the Bone-In Filet and Porterhouse for 4. The bone-in filet had a perfect char and  juicy center. The porterhouse comes out sizzling on the plate and is nothing short of awe inspiring. Beautiful piece of meat. You can literally cut through the meat with a butter knife. It was so tender and delicious. Black Peppercorn sauce was out of this world and goes so well with the steaks.   On top of the food, the service we had at old homestead was something that made our experience very special that night. Our server, Nigel, and the AGM, Casey, were so very accommodating and gave us excellent suggestions. The people here are truly knowledgeable in food ad wine and were a big help. Never did we feel ignored, which goes to show their commitment to service even on a busy night. We really appreciated them!  Old Homestead at Caesars will be my go-to spot to eat and be treated like a king. I recommend anyone go here to treat themselves or impress a date.  A++++",

I didn't have an appetizer or salad so the next part of my meal was a filet mignon.  It was cooked to my liking and tasted pretty good.  I also split the tater tots and mushroom with my co-workers.  The tater tots, although not your traditional steak side dish, was pretty good.  The mushrooms were pretty meh.  I thought they would be buttons but it was wild mushrooms and they had kind of a weird taste to them.  That made me sad because I love mushrooms.  I was also a bit disappointed in the side order portions.  Usually steakhouses sell family style size portions.  These were not necessarily family size.  They probably were single portions that you could share a bit with others, but not too much.  The service was good though, so that was a plus.",

    "text": "11 consecutive CES and countless other trips to Vegas and I never heard of this place until I decided to just pop into the closest steakhouse to my room elevator.  [hint: this was previously Nero's]  We've had all the major steakhouses covered in some 60+ days of meat hunting in vegas, and I can say that this probably has the best meat QUALITY of the lot.  I didn't say it was cheap, and while we did have some sides and dessert, there was nothing that was notches above the rest, although I have heard that the Lobster Bisque (one member of our party lunched here the same day) is remarkable.  The porterhouse for 3 and 26oz rib eye (all medium rare) was split amongst three hungry grown men and we all agreed this was not only cooked to perfection, but divided up perfectly by our skillful waiter.  We were told all the meats we ordered were aged 30 days, and it sure felt that one once it hit our palates.  I'm not sure how the strip could be so nearly as tender as the filet, or how the filet could have been so beefy, but some of that ladle full of grease smeared on top at service could have been responsible.  Once we were done, we carried on carving the succulent bits off the bone and proceeded with the uncouth behavior of just gnawing it off.   I mean, we paid a good premium for 3 bottles of Cab, so that was an excuse to just forget about etiquette altogether.  Let's face it, this may not sound like a steakhouse, but it's one. Don't count on ambiance - AT ALL.  If you need a meat fix at some of the highest prices in Vegas, go to the Old Homestead.  If you want better ambiance at 90% of the quality, go to SW.  If you want to see and be seen, go to Prime.",

Let me just say they have Dogfish Head 61 minute on draft, this alone is a five star win!!!  When ordering the prawns as an appetizer I didn't realize they would come out larger then a babies arm.  Seriously where do they find these.  Those are a must order, enough to be a meal in itself.  Our waiter Nolan helped us navigate the menu and took us on our culinary journey.  But it wasn't enough for him to do alone.  A manager, Matt I believe also helped us as a guide. Both worked well together as if they were masters of the universe. The steaks were beyond great.  Like I said if you have a chance do yourself a favor and go here.  You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "We didn't have reservations for dinner on a recent Wednesday night and had been to several restaurants at Bally's and Paris with 30-45 minute waits.  We walked over to Caeser's and glanced at the menu at Bobby Flay's Mesa restaurant and then at the Old Homestead.  Since there was no wait at the Old Homestead, we decided to eat there.  We were seated in the row of booths on the path to the kitchen which should have been a clue, I guess.  When we really looked at the menu, we were pretty horrified.  Most of the steaks were at least 16 oz servings, which is far too big for most people, and the prices were really high.  Everything was a la carte.  To add insult to injury, there were only a couple of wines on the wine list that were under $100, and most of those had a retail value of less than $20.  It's one of the rare times we didn't order wine with dinner.  Now I think I know why there was no wait...  We shared the \"Steak for Two\", which was $100.  It was OK, but certainly not the best I've ever had.  We had Gnocchi with Truffles, which was delightfully light when it was warm, but really doughy and sticky as it cooled a little and Brussels Sprouts, which were undercooked and woody.  I wish we'd at least asked if there was a wait for Mesa or kept looking.    As far as I'm concerned, this restaurant is living on it's reputation and location.  I wouldn't recommend it under any circumstances.",

    "text": "On April 4, 2012 my wife and I had dinner at the Old Homestead in Las Vegas and wrote a review on Yelp that described a very disappointing experience. Understanding that several positive changes were made at the restaurant through discussions with others, we decided to try the restaurant again on August 18, 2012 while we were in Las Vegas.    This time the experience was much more positive.  We arrived at the appointed reservation time and were promptly seated.  A waiter came to our table within 5 minutes to take our drink orders, which were promptly served. The service throughout the evening was excellent. We then ordered a wedge salad which we split. It was very fresh, crisp and quite tasty.  I ordered a Strip Steak and my wife ordered a petite Filet Mignon. We also ordered Asparagus as a side dish. We found the service that evening to be excellent.  However, the noise level at the restaurant is quite high due to the way it is set up and its open location. This did not spoil the evening. I am only mentioning it so those of you who wish to try it are aware of that issue.   The meal happened to be very good, we ordered the steaks medium rare. The steaks were quite tasty. My wife's was served perfectly cooked as medium rare but my strip steak came out cooked between medium rare and medium, although it was acceptable enough to eat and not send them back. The steaks overall were quite tasty and very tasty.  I am raising my rating of the restaurant to a 4. I might have given it a 3  1/2 if there were such a rating only because I did not get a perfect cooked medium rare steak.   While we now will consider the Old Homestead in Las Vegas again on future visits I still don't feel their steaks are at the same level we have had at Peter Lugers in Brooklyn, NY, the Old Chop house in Chicago or Joes Crab in Chicago. Restaurants we have been to dozens of times.  However, the Old Homestead in Las Vegas made quite a bit of progress since our first visit.",

    "text": "I gave this only two stars because I cannot believe that they are charging what they charge!!!!!!   The food was descent and pretty good.  Not mind blowing, not orgasmic, not amazing, and not worth the cost.  I suppose if you are a millionaire and used to dropping this kind of money without batting an eye - its the place for you.  I know prices on the strip are high, but they have taken that to its extreme here.  There were 6 of us and the bill came to $1700 incl tip!!!!   That is $283 per person!!   We had a few appetizers that the entire table shared, 2 bottles of low to mid price range wine on their list, 2 cocktails each, everyone had a steak (and not the Australian Waguy for $110), 4 sides for the table to share, 4 coffees, 4 after dinner drinks and 2 desserts.  So, put all of that into perspective and it really should have came with a message or a hotel room for that price.  I realize if you don't have any alcohol, no appetizers, no sides, no desserts and only a steak each it would have only cost  around $500.  That is a car payment.  My bone in filet was $70.  That is just too much to pay for any steak, sorry.  We will never go again, the scale is too lopsided to feel any less than completely taken advantage of.  Way to go Harrah's entertainment - if you can continue getting these prices why not?!  Not ever again for us.  We don't like feeling taken for - you're not that good!!  Just remembered...the cookie dessert is not 1000 times better than a Pazookie as our server told us.  It's not nearly as good.  If you order the Bacon - be ready for one strip of bacon on a large plate.  That's it.  No greens, no nothing, just a thick slice of bacon.  It's good bacon - but seriously?  Meatball was great, better than Rao's.  It would have been nice to have some serving utensil so we didn't all have to use our butter knives and everything else - so as to not \"double dip\".",

We finally were seated after watching several people show up \"without\" reservations and get seated ahead of us.  We ordered our food and it took 10 -15 minutes for the waiter to give us bread and water.  Some ordered appetizers and we all ordered salad.  The appetizers came out with the salad leaving no room on the table to put all the plates.  None of us were drinking wine but the wine glasses remained on the table.  I could go on and on. Service was atroshish.  .    As for the food:  The Cesear salad was small, overpriced, slimy and very fishy.    The Tuna Tartare was uninspired and had a very strange odor and taste to it.  I love raw tuna and I sent this back.  Awful!  Now it was time for the steaks and sides. First off, the steaks were way overpriced even compared to comprable steak house like Prime and Cut.    My steak was ordered medium rare and showed up medium to well.  I asked them to send another steak and it was back on the table within 10 minutes.  It was raw.  Finally I told the waiter to just take it off the bill.  Let me go on record that I almost never return food.        The sides were again, uninspired and overpriced ($12 per side)    Overall it was a terrible experience with mediocre to bad food.  Service was almost nonexistent.  You would have better luck eating at the food court.",

    "text": "This was one of the best experiences from start to finish. We dined here on Saturday before Mariah Carey. As a party of three, we were greeted quickly and sat in a beautiful booth by the front walkway.  Kim, our server, was there to greet us in a timely manner and get water service started for us. As we were waiting for our third party, Hitoshi came by to serve champagne. Before long, our friend had arrived and we ordered cocktails and appetizers.  Everything that hit the table was amazing. The jumbo crab cake was massive and filled with tender meat and the mustard sauce was delicious. West coast oysters are my preferred style due to their lighter flavor, cucumber notes, and less briney attributes. Paired with the Domaine De Vocoret Chablis made for perfect combination. The foie gras is decadence in every sense of the word. With the huckleberry sauce, it was the perfect sweet and savory. The last item was the thick cut bacon. It was smokey and paired so well with the tomato base sauce.  As for our meal: we ordered the 38oz. lollipop ribeye, lamb chops, potato puree, mac and cheese, and asparagus. Hitoshi, the GM, returned to present the wine for our meal. The Alpha Omega cabernet sauvignon was an elegant pairing for the richness of everything on the table. The high tannins cut through the richness of the meat. Everything was phenomenal. The service by Kim was definitely the stand out.   As for dessert: the apple tart with salted caramel ice cream and the big cookie with vanilla ice cream is the way to go. I'm a huge fan of desserts that pair hot and cold elements with sweet and savory elements. Take Kim's advice and have a chip shot cocktail to end. Tuaca, Bailey's, and espresso is a nice way to end the evening. I would definitely recommend stopping by Old Homestead before any show.",

I liked our waiter and his service did bump the review up 1 star.   Let's start with the service, the main waiter was great and handled much of the requests and have good recommendations based on my questions and stayed attentive. However, the secondary waiter seemed to drop the ball a lot of supporting the main waiter, for example they were supposed to bring us bread to start but instead the main waiter has to go do it himself.   Now moving on with with food. Calamari was a poor choice, it was cut so thin it practically was all batter. The calamari was pretty much all dried in the center. The lobster mac and cheese was decent but certainly I've easily have had better overall disappointing considering the supposed reputation of the restaurant. Lastly the rib eye lollipop was only decent again. Even though they char the outside the ribeye itself lacked much flavor. It was huge though we were only able to get through 75% of it.   The total bill was $209 for the 3 items for anyone who wanted to know. The quality to value ratio is not good enough to come back again.",

Upon arriving it was raining and traffic was a bit hectic, and we were 15 mins late to our reservation, I called and they advised it wouldn't be an issue.   Standard valet was full at Caesar's Palace, so in a rush, we opted for VIP VALET and hurried in. Upon arrival we were greeted warmly and seated promptly, as we waited for our server, we couldn't remember if the rate was flat or hourly. We asked our server and she made sure someone found out for us. The manager approached our table 10 minutes later with all of the rates the hotel charges for valet. IMPRESSIVE service!  The food was divine. Calamari to start (so good), for our entrees, I had the 10oz filet, my mother had salmon and we shared grilled asparagus and a baked potato. My Filet was cooked to the perfect doneness of medium, my mother's salmon was spectacular... crispy skin with a flavorful seasoned sear... heaven! Our bill total was a bit high, but that is expected with great service and quality food; our meal + my moms glass of wine totaled $186, without dessert.   Homestead has definitely left a lasting impression on me. I will be sure to dine here again next time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "Love this steakhouse. When I stay at Caesars this place is just a few minutes walk from the tower I stay in. On my last visit to this restaurant I was alone for dinner and sat at the bar since it's kinda awkward sitting alone at a table when the restaurant is full. If you want a good dinner and don't want to travel outside of Caesars eat here. This upscale steakhouse is right across from Nobu. It's in a open area off the casino floor so try to sit away from the entrance. The food here is excellent. They have Wagyu steaks here too. The best thing happened to me last time, I ordered a dozen oysters for an appetizer before my meal and the first server to help me took that order but I ended up with another server both of which put in the order for the oysters. So, I ended up getting an extra dozen oysters for FREE, made me happy as they were very good. The oysters I believe they have 3/4 kinds and you can get your dozen split into each choice for an extra charge. If you're a Caesars Rewards card holder you can use your comps here too. The restaurant is nice and not very big. Customer service is good too. My Overall experiences here have been good..",

I enjoy service where they are attentive without being intrusive; I found this to be the case here at Old Homestead. For our dinner, we shared the crab cake... wonderful and big enough to share.  Our entrees included the lobster tail for her and the Wagyu A5 strip loin for me.  Our sides were the lobster mac and cheese and the Yukon gold mashed potatoes.  Both were presented well and our sides piping hot.  This was actually quite a lot of food.  The steak entree came with mixed vegetables and a potato puree; more than enough for me.  The lobster tail was cooked to perfection.  The lobster mac and cheese was rich and tasty.  It was very filling.  The mashed potatoes were good, but unnecessary due to the other sides. My steak was cooked medium and had a nice char on the outside.  It was very good... would I order it again?  Probably not.  All in all, Old Homestead is a good go to option for your traditional steak house.",

    "text": "I went for \"happy hour\" (10-11pm, $7 half-sized appetizers and some great drinks).  Overall, really good food and a great value.  The portions were half sized of default-huge portions; a normal person could easily make a meal of any 2 of these.  Meatball -- probably the best meatball I've had anywhere.  You expect it to be good at a steakhouse (since they use trimmings from high quality steak) but this somehow exceeded my expectations.  Crab cake -- the best overall dish.  All crab, not breading filler, and a great size.  Crab cocktail -- lump crabmeat, served on ice.  Unfortunately I ate this before taking a photo, but it was as good.  I personally prefer whole dungeness or king crab in shell, but this was a good amount of crab meat with less hassle in extracting it.  Mac and cheese -- a huge portion of very cheesy Mac and cheese, served in cast iron.  I only was abl to eat half of this, as I was stuffed, but it was very good.  Bar staff were friendly and prepared great drinks, too (I just had one Manhattan, as I have a work conference call in an hour).  The manager stopped by to check on me as well (maybe when he saw me taking photos of my food), and was friendly too.  The happy hour is a great value (show up closer to the beginning vs the end because they do tend to close the kitchen around this time), and I'll come back again for a full dinner sometime.  I've had consistently very good to great food at every Caesars restaurant.",

It was really Gamey. Tough like a tri-tip cut to look like a filet. I'm pretty sure it was dairy cow. Look at the pic. Total fake filet cut.   Doesn't taste aged at all like they claimed.   Just being honest and not trying to be too harsh.  But I've cooked a better dairy cow steak from the grocery store.   For $100 you think you would get a great steak. At least a good steak.   I left $40 worth of the steak there.  Too tough and unenjoyable to even eat.   Mac and cheese good But the steak was a fail.   Says steak house. Not mac and cheese house.  Super waste of money.  Only went because The Edge Steakhouse was booked up. Thought I couldn't go wrong with this place.   Literally the second worst steak I've ever had.",

I always get the Bone-In filet cause I usually eat alone & it's always cooked to perfection.  Pair it w/ the beautiful red wine flight that is usually $50 for three expensive excellent wines.

I had called to push our reservation back 30 minutes and was told it was no problem. I show and hey say that there was no change in reservation, no long wait so not a big issue, but as we get taken to the table it's not set yet so we're hanging in the aisle where we're clearly in the way and the manager asks if he can help us which we tell him we're waiting on that table.   The next part is what really bothered me and that was the food. There must not be any salt in the kitchen because every dish lacked seasoning primarily salt. The tuna tartare was very bland, truffle gnocchi tasted like bland cream with overly doughy pasta. The ribeye came out 2 steps up from medium rare, I sent it back and the 2'nd one came out which was cooked well but again had no seasoning.   Service was mediocre at best, saw the wait staff every 20 minutes and lack of care was very apparent. Probably one of the most overrated spots on the strip. Not worth the $260 for two people.",

French onion soup was all right but the prime rib was out of this world. I think I conservatively can say I have eaten prime rib at 500 different top restaurants  and these guys might be number 1.  The service here was good but not great.  The creme brulee with Grand Marnier soaked berries and creme fraiche was pretty damn good as well. It was an excellent meal for 69 bucks in Vegas. I might very well come back again this week for prime rib again it was so good.",

The NYE prix fix was a tuna tartare with black truffles, \"ultimate\" surf and turf with Maine lobster tail and a STUNNING A5 American Wagyu filet mignon, and mini choco lava cakes with a mango/passion fruit panna cota to finish.  The American Wagyu, cooked medium, was just perfect-- a wonderful salty sear and a cool pink center.  Great place for a special occasion meal--one of our favorite LV spots  ***The only room for improvement was that the tuna tartare would have benefited from a couple more crisps.",

    "text": "My wife and I were in town for 4 nights to eat-drink-gamble. One of the dinners we had was on January 26th at The Old Homestead. We originally had a 7PM reservation but changed it to 4:45. We arrived on time and were seated on time. The first table was in a hallway of sorts and we asked to be moved and they did. Our waiter, Bradley, was AWESOME! He's a NAWLINS native and we talked NAWLINS all night. He definitely made the evening go well! We started with cocktails (an Ol' Fashion and a Grey Goose Gimlet) both were excellent. For appetizers we ordered the Alaskan King Crab Legs and a bowl of the Lobster Bisque. The bisque had a deeper / smokier color and taste then most I've tasted but it was EXCELLENT. The highlight here were the Crab Legs for $56.00. OMG they were Great and paired well with the cracked mustard sauce served with them. For dinner, we split a large Filet, cooked perfectly Medium as we ordered. The sides we got were sauteed spinach and the truffle mashed potatoes....both did not disappoint, although I prefer a little more garlic in the spinach. For dessert we shared a creme brulee. We had also brought a bottle of wine in ($50 corkage). Overall it was a terrific 5 Star dinner.",

She asked for a bit of a private table so we could talk and not annoy others around us. They gave us a table towards the back that was perfect. I think our waiter was Bradley (sorry if I'm writing the wrong name-it was an older gentleman with glasses). The service was just as amazing as the food. They bring out a basket of different breads to munch on. The bacon bread..YUMMM. The lemon bread was not so great, but there was plenty of other ones to try. I don't eat steak so I had the chicken and boy was it great. The accompanying sauce was divine. My friends loved their food as well. Even as a non-meat eater, I was able to appreciate the presentation (even though it freaked some of them out LOL!).  After our meal, they brought out complimentary birthday desserts for the table, the apple cobbler was delish-that's coming from a huge chocolate fan!. Bradley asked us about our evening plans and we told him we wanted to go to Omnia and he brought his manager over to help us girls out. Well they sure did. We literally were escorted inside without waiting in line :) Besides that, just everything about this place is great. If you want to splurge while here, give this place a try.",

    "text": "How this place has a 3 star average is beyond me, maybe I went on a really good day.  We ate dinner at OH on a Saturday night.  It was crowded, but that did not affect the level of service we received or our comfort level.  The bread basket they bring is fantastic, as many note.  It may be the best gratis bread basket I've eaten at a steakhouse.  The cheesy muffins were out of this world good, I wish they would sell them so I can bake them at home.  Watch out you don't fill up on bread at this place.  To start, we had the garlic bread and calamari.  The garlic bread was stacked liked a small jenga tower, and sitting in a bed of cheese sauce.  It was crunchy and delicious when dipped in the sauce.  The calamari was likewise good, it had some peppers in it, but I wouldn't go so far as to call it Rhode Island style.  But, the peppers added some nice spice.  The breading was crisp and adhered to the calamari well.  To eat, we had the porterhouse for 4.  This was a good amount of steak for 4 people with sides, but if you are looking to eat a 25 ounce steak or larger on your own, it's not a good selection for you.  I preferred the NY strip side of the porterhouse, as I always do.  But, both sides were perfectly cooked to medium rare and had a nice char.  For sides, we had the lobster mac n cheese (which was a special I believe), the creamed spinach, and the famous tater tots with fat boy sauce.  The fat boy sauce is basically sour cream, large pieces of bacon, and shredded cheese mixed together.  The creamed spinach was fantastic, maybe the best version of this dish I've ever had.  It had a great crust on it and excellent flavor.  I had seconds, which makes the meal healthy because I had a vegetable, right?    The mac and cheese was solid, but I've had better at many other steakhouses.  The tater tots were the real winner for me, they are large, but were perfectly fried and done in the middle.  You could taste that they are made of potato, which is not the case with most fast food tater tots.  The sauce was great on them as well.  I think returning to OH for a burger at lunch and enjoying these may be in my future.  We had baked Alaska for dessert.  It's always cool seeing it lit on fire, but this dish doesn't do it for me.  Not just at OH, but anywhere really.  Overall, the food was fantastic, and the service was great.  Wine, beer, and water glasses were never empty.  An excellent evening, and the price is in line with the high end steakhouses on the strip.  I will return and recommend you dine here as well...",

Prices are what you could expect to pay at any top rated steakhouse in Las Vegas. My $67 16oz NY bone in was cooked to perfection. Salads and sides are big enough to share. Bread basket was top-tier excellent for being complementary and bottomless.   I would definitely dine here again. This place is perfect for bigger groups. A little bit on the loud side.

I like to frequent a couple steakhouses every time I come to Las Vegas so when my flight was cancelled due to a snowstorm back in Boston I rejoiced at the chance to check out a place I had always meant to try after having two fantastic dinners at both SW in the Wynn and CUT in the Venetian (a must stop every time out) on the trip.   Started out with the Calamari appetizer, which was flavorful although the dish only consists of calamari rings.   I then ordered the 24oz bone in Gotham ribeye with a side of mushrooms. After making a few drinks, the bartender came over to confirm the Gotham choice and  temperature I preferred (medium rare plus) and we were off to the races. Or so I thought.   An appropriate amount of time later the steak came out. No bone. Just your basic 16oz ribeye... Now, as someone who prefers the flavor of his steaks cooked with the bone-in this was hugely disappointing and plays a main role in my poor experience. The bartender did offer a coffee in return for the mishap, but I didn't go to Old Homestead to try out the coffee.",

Delicious.  We were stuck deciding between the Wagyu and Japanese Wagyu. Our server suggested the Japanese and so we went with it. There was an error and the American Wagyu was brought out and we were not impressed. However, our server saw there was a mistake and bright out the Japanese Wagyu immediately (we had no clue we were brought the wrong dish) and there is no comparison! The American Wagyu honestly taste like a filet mignon... The Japanese Wagyu was prepared perfectly and the meat was so juicy!  I fell in love with this dish.  If you're stuck between which one based on the price tag, the extra you pay is definitely worth it.   It might seem like the server is trying to upsell you but the difference is Japanese and American Wagyu truly is on quality. This is coming from someone who tried both side to side :P",

Carl, our bartender, makes a damn solid, well-balanced Manhattan, and he was good enough to let me know they were out of absinthe when I ordered a Sazerac, and to confirm that I was okay with a Pernod as replacement.  This is a solid move on his part.  My date, who sometimes struggles to get a vodka martini that's dirty enough for her liking, was pleased with Carl's handiwork as well.

Going through these reviews, that logic seems to have held True for the most part. Ask any properly trained chef, and he will likely tell you the same thing. Overcooking a good cut of meat will ruin it.   That having been said, everybody in my party ordered their steak rare or medium rare. There wasn't a single complaint to be had with any of the steak, and coming from a group of five Texans that's an exceedingly rare event.  The service was fantastic, and the cocktails are strong. We ordered five steaks, two side potatoes, a side of mushrooms, and a side of brussels sprouts. I tried everything except for the brussels sprouts, and it was on point. I, myself, had the six or 8 ounce filet mignon, I can't remember which size. Either way, it was the best steak I've ever had in my entire life.  True, the prices are pretty steep. But, in this case, you get what you pay for. I highly recommend Homestead Steakhouse for at least one \"splurge\" dinner for the meat lovers.",

The colossal shrimp is no joke - HUGE!   I had the filet on the bone and my husband had the center cut sirloin. Both were amazing (we both like medium rare). So much flavor and so soft. I'm a big steak fan and I could eat either of these steaks every night.   Don't forget to try some sides - my favorite were the homemade tater tots!   Because my husband had mentioned it was birthday before the staff kept telling me happy birthday, and were more than pleasant.

All three years, I've ordered the same: Porterhouse steak for two (about $110) + foie gras ($16 to $20) + truffle gnocchi ($16) (and some additional sides). This visit, my party was 6, so we ordered multiple Porterhouse and a whole bunch of sides. When the food arrived, we were so disappointed. The steaks were overcooked and charred at the sides. Foie gras was small and burnt at the top (not seared). I brought it up to the server and he gave excuses. I didn't want to make a scene so I brought up a pic of the previous year's unburnt foie and he promised to do something about my tiny, burnt one. After a long while, he came back with another dish of foie. Sigh. Just as burnt and small. But gratis, so I stopped complaining. I really want to like this place, I've had good memories. Servers are all very attentive and professional. If this was a review only about the front of the house, I'd give it 5 stars. But the food. Ugh. Party of 6's bill was approx $650. Dinner on 8 July.",

    "text": "We went to Old Homestead on Jan 29, and I was so looking forward to it, especially given the reputation of its renowned NYC parent.  Geez, was I disappointed. The service was great, but the food absolutely sucked. The cook(s), for whatever reason, either wouldn't or couldn't properly cook mine or my wife's filets ... medium-well ... which isn't that hard to do. They tried three times and never got the steaks beyond medium rare, but they burned the outside of the steaks to hell. Needless to say, the steaks were completely ruined at that point. And when the concierge came to our table, he only asked if our food was okay. When we said it wasn't, his reply was, \"Yeah, I saw you send it back.\"  When our server came to our table a couple of minutes later and asked if the manager had come over, we said no, but that the concierge had. The server then informed us that it wasn't the concierge at all, but rather the manager (he never introduced himself as the manager). Of course, he never came back over to the table or attempted to rectify the problem in any way whatsoever. He didn't even bother to offer an apology on behalf of the restaurant. However, he had absolutely no problem charging us $192.42 for an absolutely crappy meal.  This place sucks and I'll never go back, nor will I recommend it to anyone ... except to recommend they not go. The Old Homestead in Caesars replaces another steakhouse that was called Neros. While Neros was nothing to write home about, it was lightyears better than The Old Homestead. As such, avoid this dump at all costs.",

    "text": "This place was my Jan Cheat Meal and I must say it was damn good!  The Server was friendly (even though he stopped just short of saying everything on the menu was amazing). The place is nice, the table setting and flatware is great (I loved their steak knives).  The Food was good, but sadly the only really memorable part of the entire menu was the bread basket. The Basket included a pumpernickel bread, dinner rolls, the pretzel breadstick that you can get in any Caesars Ent Diamond lounge, and the mack daddy of the Bread Basket, THE ASAIGO BACON MUFFIN, you read that right, a muffin that included bacon and asiago cheese, this was hands down the highlight of the meal.  The Caesar Salad was average at best, it was about 4 pieces of lettuce, with a few croutons, The Mac and Cheese was ok, but I've had better, the NY Strip was a good piece of cow, not the greatest slice of cow I've ever eaten, but it was cooked almost perfectly, nice sear on the outside, a little past med rare (which was my only complaint), but still good   The food was OK, and the service was great, but for the premium price they're charging I was hoping for more. It's a good place, but in a city packed with top notch Steak Houses, it sadly will get lost in the mix. Good Cow, but there's better.  Another random thing, there was a table full of people who were in town for Chinese New Year next to us, they thought it would be a great idea to bring a child with them to a high end steak house, this would have been ok, but after we were seated, the child decided the empty place setting at our table would be a great place to play on her iPad, her parents just sat there and watched her as she played some random game on her iPad while we were getting settled into our table, not really the restaurant's fault but still unacceptable.",

I had the wild mushrooms which were good and the parmesan bread sticks were also very good.  If I had come for that I would rate this place 5 stars.    I would not waste my time or my money here again.  I will keep looking for a good steak house that I do not need a loan to eat at, total bill $135.  :(",

    "text": "We were staying at Caesar's Palace and wanted to get a nice dinner Sat night. We had walked by Friday and it was PACKED and thought this would be an awesome place to try. They don't take reservations between 6-9 so we made reservations for 530. Good thing because by 630 there was already a small line forming by the hostess stand. I really like the openness and vibe of the restaurant and the staff were all very attentive, minus the hostess. (We walked by earlier to make a reservation at 545 and the hostess standing NEXT to the one we were talking to CHIMED IN with \"We don't accept reservations from 6-9PM\" We were like... Okay.... we wanted a reservation at 545!\" Needless to say she minded her own business after that.)  We arrived at our reservation and was promptly seated. Our waiter checked on us every so often throughout dinner to see if we needed anything and the other staff were so animated, friendly, and helpful. The bread basket came with a lot of different kinds of bread but we had to limit the bread intake because we ordered so much yummy food!  Since there were 5 of us we ordered A TON OF FOOD:  Lobster Bisque: This was very tasty and rich. The lobster pieces were so big and the quality is just really up there.   Crab Cakes: Also, really big pieces of crab. The cakes are smaller, but tall so there was still a lot of it. The sauce was also really good. Only thing about this was that it broke apart so easily so it was harder to eat with a fork.  Fried Calamari: This was the only thing that I didn't enjoy that much. The pieces were kind of soggy and just fell apart when picked up with a fork. We left a lot on this plate untouched.  Porterhouse Steak for 2: This came out on a piping hot place with butter and they served it for us. It included filet and strip steak. It was a good amount and the filet was really nice and tender.  Filet Mignon on the Bone: This was SOOO TENDER and tasty! It was a HUGE piece of filet mignon and just so delicious. This is something I would get again!  Prime Rib on the Bone: When this came out I was thinking... holy... this was so BIG! It looked really juicy, but I didn't try it because I was so full... I think this piece is actually enough for TWO though.  Dover Sole: One of the servers filleted the sole off of the bone tableside and gave us a nice show which was pretty amusing. The sauce was a lemony sauce and the fish was cooked and seasoned perfectly.   For sides we tried: Duck fat french fries: try these without ketchup and you can really taste the difference. I was still craving these the next day!  Creamed spinach: Nice and creamy, but didn't stand out too much.  Sauteed Mushrooms: I really liked how they put a variety of mushrooms in here and not the usual white mushrooms.   Mashed Potatoes: These were mashed pretty finely and just melt in your mouth goodness!   And of course dessert:  Ice Cream over chocolate chip cookie: This was like a pizookie from BJ's but the cookie was must more moist and it was a great finish to a wonderful meal.  I would have to say that they also have a good collection of wines, but when you ordered cocktails the glasses are pretty tiny... like smaller than the average by a lot.   This is def a great place to get steak although it is a bit pricey... but hey, it's Vegas. Everything's a little more pricy... I feel it's worth it because the portions are so big and the quality is so good!",

My wife & I went last Sat. night with a couple of friends of ours & I still can't stop thinking about how great the food was. It was all so good & we ate so much, I think I'm still FULL.   We started with the \"KITCHEN SINK SALAD\", STEAK WEDGE SALAD, \"THICK CUT\" BACON (a.k.a. Bacon Steak), KOBE TARTARE & KOBE MEATBALL...OMmmmmmmmG! My mouth just started to water while I was typing all that. Definitely order the KOBE MEATBALL, because it's hands down, the BEST meatball that I've ever had in my LIFE! You won't regret it.  As for the main course, the steaks were DAMN DELICIOUS and the sides were just as tasty! We had the HOMESTEAD MAC & FOUR CHEESE (More please!), GRANDMA'S CREAMED SPINACH (So good, probably like Popeye's Granny would make it), TATER TOTS WITH FAT BOY SAUCE (sour cream, bacon bits, etc.), POTATO GNOCCHI WITH TRUFFLE BUTTER (DO IT, DO IT!) & \"DUCK FAT\" FRIES (Quack!)...if you order any combo of these sides with your meal, you won't be disappointed. We definitely weren't.  For dessert, we had CHOCOLATE CAKE, CREME BRULEE (again, best I've ever had in my life!), NY CHEESECAKE & A GIANT COOKIE TOPPED WITH ICE CREAM, CANDY PIECES & WHIPPED CREAM (Kinda like BJ's Pizookie, but on freakin' STEROIDS! You gotta order one). Even though we were so FULL, there's always room for dessert, right? & with desserts this good staring you in the face, it would be almost a crime not to eat them, so we did & they were AMAZING! What a great way to cap off a perfect meal.    THANKS, OHS!!!!!",

Especially at the prices they're charging at this place! Everything from the steaks ($56 for a 26 oz bone-in ribeye!) and the sides (all $12, even the duck fat fries!) are obscenely overpriced....(damn you, casino-revenue-sharing!)  The meat (imported from New York so it must be really good, right?) is no better than Mastro's, Prime, Carnevino (also obscenely overpriced!!!), Joe's or Envy. The wine list is good, but not spectacular. The service is slightly better than adequate. The bread-basket is ok, but ordinary: (hey look! it's pretzel bread! Wow.) The decor is cliche New York club-style...(close your eyes and poof! you're at PJ Clarkes!)  There are better choices at better prices all over town, so I won't be returning anytime soon. But the place was packed...so I have to assume it's either captive hotel-guests who didn't want to leave the premises...or a bunch of people partyin' before the Mayan apocalypse.  By the way, I passed on the $12 desserts....went to the Sugar Factory.",

We were seated at a great table that felt like we were in the middle of all the action and not banished to a dark corner. The waiter arrived quickly with a wine list and our menus. We ordered drinks and they arrived right away along with an AMAZING  bread basket!! We had tons of questions about the menu and our waiter was very knowledgeable of each item and made our decisions very easy!   We started with the French Onion Soup and Steakhouse Wedge Salad! Yummy!!! We decided to split the items and the waiter brought us each a portion of the salad so no messy sharing! It was very nice!   We decided to order the Porterhouse Steak for two and it was delicious! The steak literally melted in my mouth! (not exaggerating!) For our sides we had asparagus, Mac and cheese, and truffle gnocchi!!   We finished it off with creme brulee! We were too stuffed to eat the Key Lime pie there but had to order it to go so we could enjoy it later! (all the other reviews were right!!! I'm from Florida and it gave my hometown Key Lime pie a run for its money!)  Overall it was a great experience and an extremely satisfying meal! The best date night so far!!",

Saw a review somewhere re the bread basket and bacon appetizer at the Old Homestead Steakhouse and made the decision to have my three favorite items all in one meal.  Made reservations in advance of the trip and were promptly seated at 8:00 on a Thursday night.  Definitely a special occasion-type restaurant, unless dropping $200+ is no big deal to you.  Had to use the flashlight app on the phone to read the menu to confirm the choices I had already made beforehand. Started with the bacon appetizer, which was one big (1/4\" thick?) slab of bacon, and the tuna tartare (a/k/a poke). We split the Kitchen Sink Salad and I ate every bit on my plate.  Combined with a sample of each roll in the bread basket, I was a bit full for my New York with Bernaise.  The BF's prime rib was huge and perfectly cooked.  We ended up taking half our dinners back to the hotel for a late night snack.  They packed them in nice containers and were thoughtful enough to add a container of sauce, napkins, and swanky plastic utensils.  Glad I chose this place!",

It was late on a Sunday and my flight was leaving Vegas in a few short hours so I followed my travel buddies into Old Homestead.  Steak?   Always.   We were seated right away in a booth in the back.  The decor was modern, clean, and simple.  Our plates had napkins folded neatly and displayed different cuts of meat, mine was Filet.  Our waiter was fantastic and eager to talk about the menu regardless of it being the end of his shift.  We were a large party and he supported us in just getting several items to share rather than getting separate meals.  We order diver scallops, rib eye on the bone, lobster tails, tater tots with fat kid sauce,  mac & cheese, risotta, and creamed spinach.  I cannot complain about one item.   I ate at this location years ago when it was Neros and still think highly of it.   The Fat Kid Sauce, which the waiter said was an homage to the chefs mother who made him this sauce when he was growing up.  The sauce consisted of everything you would put on a loaded baked potato and it was the perfect companion to tater tots... and I thought tater tots needed nothing!",

    "text": "I went to Old Homestead with a couple of girlfriends this past Vegas trip. After already trying Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill on a previous trip we decided to give this place a try.  It is your typical Vegas upscale steakhouse, dark, classy, and loud.  First of all, I want to say that the food was AMAZING. The service however was not very good at all. I would rate the food 5 stars and the service 1 star.  Lets start with the food. They start you off with a bread and butter basket that contained mostly your generic rolls, rye bread, pretzel rolls, and my favorite the cheddar bacon roll (it sort of reminded me of the rolls they give you at red lobster but I'm not complaining).   For an appetizer, we decided to share the calamari and a crab cake. Both were delicious! The calamari wasn't very different from any other fried calamari you can order but I had no complaints about it. The crab cake tasted very fresh and melted in your mouth.  For our entree's one of my girlfriends opted for the Kobe Burger. Our server informed us that the burger was absolutely gigantic and he was not lying. It came with some tater tots and she could not even finish half of her meal after that and the appetizers. As someone who does not eat a lot of red meat she joked that she couldnt believe she spent 42 dollars on a burger, but she said it was delicious and really enjoyed it.   My other girlfriend got one of their salads and the mac and cheese side. Not something I would get at a steakhouse but to each their own. For what it's worth the salad tasted delicious and the mac and cheese was AWESOME, but you cant go wrong with mac n cheese can you?  I decided to order the petit filet mignon. I knew I wanted steak and I didn't want to pay too much for something I wouldn't finish so this 55 dollar entree was perfect for me. And it was divine! Best filet mignon I have had in a long time. So much flavor! It came with steak sauce and a bearnaise sauce, the steak sauce was good but the bearnaise was way better. I would recommend this dish to anyone.  Now to the service. Me and my friends are all in our early twenties and we definitely felt like victims of age discrimination here. The crowd is a mix of older and younger people but I didnt see many groups of females our age. The hostess was very polite and we got seated without reservations in less than 5 minutes. However from that point it took another 5-10 minutes for our server to come over and another 5-10 minutes just for him to bring us tap water. And it wasn't even him it was the bus boy. The food took a while to come out but that did not bother me as much as the fact that he very rarely stopped by our table to see if we were doing alright or if we needed anything. we gave most of our requests to the guy refilling water because our server was more concerned with chatting up guests who I am assuming he thought had a lot more money than we did. After we finished he left our dishes on our table for over 15 minutes before taking them away and asking if we needed the check. A good portion of that was spent right behind us talking to a table of two older couples about vegas hotspots.   This kind of behavior would usually be enough to warrent a 1 star rating, but the food was so good that I had to give it more. I understand that servers do not want to deal with young cheapskates but me and my friends were all dressed nicely in dresses and we spent over 200 dollars on our meal  and tipped generously. I do not seem why he would treat us like 2nd class customers just because we look young.  tl;dr: delicious food, poor service unless you look like you have money",

My filet steak was delish and the potato gnocchi truffle butter side was nothing i had ever had before. Very yummy and original. I wanted to try the bread pudding for dessert,but was way too stuffed to fit it in.  Maybe next time!",

    "text": "Weird name of an expensive steakhouse. The decor was lacking. My friends and I eat at a \"top 10 Las Vegas Steakhouse\" monthly. I was surprised that this was on the (near the bottom) of the list. It had previously been on the list as Nero's (what used to be at this location), but this year it was replaced by Old Homestead. The actual restaurant was average to nice, but half the restaurant was open to a tourist walkway. Booths were small and not that comfortable. Wile the food and wine was good, the bill for six of us was around $900.....$500 of which to my husband and I. While money is not an issue, I felt that for that cost the experience was somewhat lacking. My filet was cooked perfectly and was tender and the wine was great (we had bottles), but compared to other top ten steakhouses we have visited, I am confused as to why Old Homestead is on the list. Our waiter was attentive, but was one of those people who though he was funny all the time (I hate that). Wile I'm glad we went (as its on the Las Vegas Weekly Top Ten Steakhouse list), our group will not be returning. Overpriced for the experience. How is this steakhouse even placed on a list with SW Steakhouse and Carnivino?",

I can probably name more places in Vegas for a better steak at a decent price.  We got the wedge salad that we split, can't really go wrong there, but for $15 so not worth it.  The porterhouse for 2 and the cauliflower augratin.  And don't look at the menu off their site, the prices are about $5 cheaper than at Caeser's.",

    "text": "Where do I start?  Let's start with the reason they are getting 1 stars instead of 0 (if that were possible). The host was very nice.  He accommodated us on a Sunday night without a reservation.  We didn't get the best table in the house, but it was decent.   Our server was very friendly as well.  I wish I could remember his name (Matt?). The bread basket is amazing!  I had high hopes our dinner would be as well.  If they can bake great bread, they should be able to cook a good steak.   To start we had the tuna tartar. It was pretty good and very refreshing.  We also ordered the onion rings as a side.  These were some of the best onion rings I have ever had.  We decided to split the prime rib (it was 32oz) and order the lobster tails.  The lobster was very good.  Perfectly cooked, tender and sweet.   Now the prime rib is where it all went down hill.  We ordered it medium rare.  The server offered to have them split it in the kitchen for us and we agreed.  When they brought it out it looked amazing.  But one bite, and utter disappointment set in.  It was very cold.  The au jus it was sitting in had the temperature as if it had just come out of the refrigerator. We told our server, he apologized and said he would take care of it.  They brought us the plates back out after about 10 minutes.  What they actually did was put them in the oven, which all it did was make the plate very hot and overcook the meat.  It was not edible the meat was so overcooked.   Our plates were taken away with almost all of our steak left.  The busser never even informed our waiter that we expressed our displeasure with the steak, or even the fact he removed our plate with the entire cuts of meat still there! When we saw our waiter, we expressed our situation.  He apologized and offered us free dessert.  Free dessert? really? We ordered a $70 steak, it was ruined so bad that we could not eat it, and you want us to get a free dessert? I assumed that when the check came we would not be charged for that item.  But there it was, on the bill.  We had to call the waiter back over and ask him why they would charge us for an item they ruined and we couldn't/didn't eat.  He left to go get a manager.  The manager did take it off our bill, but only after we had to repeat our entire story.  Didn't our server explain our situation?  Very unprofessional service.  Our bill was still $150 without the prime rib.  We left hungry and went back to our hotel and ordered room service. The saddest part is that this whole time the table next to us had ordered the prime rib.  It looked so delicious and the gentleman was enjoying it so much that it made us feel even worse.  We even pointed it out to our waiter and said \"That is what we ordered, that is what we expected.\"  He never even offered to bring us a new meal.  I never want to go back to that place again.",

    "text": "I walked by and decided to have a glass of wine before dinner, figuring that I'd probably eat elsewhere. They have a very good selection of very nice wines, and that also goes for the wines by the glass. Most wines by the glass are in the $20 - $40 range, but definitely better than what most restaurants back home have available. The wine was so good I decided that I needed a dinner to compliment it. So I ate at the bar and had a very good meal. The Caesar salad was just ok... The dressing was a bit bland for my taste, not much cheese either and no anchovy. I'm still hoping I can find a great Caesars salad during my stay at Caesars! I ordered the 8 oz Filet...it was done perfectly and the whole plate was excellent, but I'd probably choose a Ruths Chris filet over it even if price were equal. The asparagus was awesome...probably the best I've had. The service from the bartenders was excellent... Those guys are pros.",

    "text": "My son and I arrived 1/2 hour early to Old Homestead. They could not locate our reservation, but asked to be seated . We were taken to a table as requested. My son ordered a beer and I had bottled water with lemon. The menus were given to us and the the waiter ( Will ) explained what the signature items were. We took some time trying to read the menu and had to use our cell phone to see and read. It was really too dark to see without the light from our cells. My son ordered the10 oz Steak Filet Mignon, RARE. He also ordered the Maine Lobster Bisque. I ordered the Halibut with fingerling potatoes and wild mushroom. I also ordered the Kobe Meatball with marinara and ricotta cheese. We ordered side dishes of potato gnocci sauteed spinach &  fire roasted corn. The Lobster Bisque came and it was outstanding. It had real lobster which was a nice touch. The Meatball was excelent. The presentation was nice. Did not care for the recotta cheese. The marinara was very sweet, and did not go nice with the meatball.    The meals came -- my sons steak was more to the Medium rare than rare, but said the flavor more than made up for the steak not cooked the way he wanted it. My Halibut was a touch salty but with the seasoning, they used, it was great-very moist, and had a great taste. My son liked the gnocci, I did not care for them. We did not care for the spinach and corn is corn. Dessert was offered. My son had rthe Key lime pie. He said that is was very good. I did not taste it, so Im taking his word. I had the Warm Banana Bread Pudding, with salted Caramel and Vanilla Bean Ice Cream. This is a dessert to die for. It was the finale touch to a great meal. If one dines at Homestead and does not try this pudding you do not know what you are missing. Will our waiter was attentive but not hanging over us. My water was filled when needed, and my son did not want another beer.  We both agreed that overall things were great. Our only complaint was not being able to read the menu without our cell phones. We both recommend Old Homestead Steakhouse as a place to get a real  fine meal. You will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "After having an awful experience on Valentine's day and posting on Yelp about my experience, I was contacted by Food and Beverage at Caesars. She apologized, said many improvements were made, and invited us back for dinner. I was very impressed that I was contacted about my experience and how they wanted to make it right. While I was impressed, I was initially very hesitant because our first experience was so bad. However, my wife and I discussed it and we decided to go back. If they were putting forth the effort to make it right, we can put forth the effort to go back. And wow, I'm glad we went back. It was absolutely fantastic.   The hostess that greeted us was very professional and wasn't a snob like the hostess we encountered at our last visit. The waiter was very knowledgeable, courteous, and prompt. Drinks were always refilled and the waiter had ninja skills because I would see a new glass of lemonade and wonder when he had put it there. Additionally, he would always make sure that everything was okay.  My wife ordered the Alaskan king crab, mashed potatoes, lemonade and loved her meal. I had the Petaluma chicken, Lemonade (which is really good), and stole some of my wife's mashed potatoes. Our meal was excellent!  The chicken was so good I just wanted to caveman it and stuff my face. The mashed potatoes didn't have 10 pounds of butter in it but was just right. They even threw in a couple of free appetizers for us to try. I was absolutely impressed by how much this place had changed that I kept repeating it to my wife. I'm surprised she didn't stick a piece of bread in my mouth to shut me up. The manager then came over and spoke to us for a little bit. He said that they were working on the restaurant and have made a lot of improvements. He seemed to have a genuine concern for customers and their experience. I did, however, have to knock off one star because of the noise. While the food was excellent, the noise was not. It gets very loud in there and I had a hard time hearing my wife. I did mention that to him and it is an issue they're working on.  It was time for dessert and the waiter explained what desserts they had. My wife and I were both waiting to see if he would tell us that there was coconut in the chocolate chip cookie and sure enough, he did! That impressed us both. I don't recall if it was on the menu or not. I really wanted to try it again but I absolutely hate coconut. It worked out though because even though I wanted to get something, I was absolutely stuffed. My wife did get dessert, however.  We spoke to the manager again and thanked him for everything. A day or two later, I called the person who contacted me from food and beverage and told her about my experience. I also mentioned to her about the noise so hopefully that's something that will be fixed. When I go to dinner, I want to be able to have a conversation, relax, etc. Other than the noise issue, our experience was absolutely fantastic and I would certainly go again. Great job!",

My mother and I went to the Old Homestead Steakhouse @ Caesars Palace LV because we heard rave about it and we were craving steak. We got in line to see if we could be seated. There were a lot of people standing around to be seated and the restaurant was packed. The women that were behind the podium did not say \" We'll be right with you\" or anything to us. They were just in their own bubble. We were standing there for about 10 minutes until a woman worker looked over my mothers head and asks the people behind us have you been helped. Mind you that we were right in front of the podium. The men behind us asked if we have been helped and we said \"no\". The women whose name I did not get looks at my mom and says \"What is it\". My mother and I were instantly confused, mad, and upset. We gave you the decency to wait for you to help us. This incident gave me an epiphany and I will NEVER go to this restaurant again!!  I give this restaurant no stars but yelp would not let me continue without putting a star. Does not deserve any stars!(Wipes hands clean)",

We enjoyed everything that was ordered.  The service was excellent. The signature steak was our favorite, it just was so tasteful. The Kobe Meatball was also great. All of the staff was attentive and patience with any questions.  Old Homestead Steakhouse is a wonderful place to eat. My 16 yr old son that loves to eat, is ready to go again. If he enjoyed his dinner, that something to pay attention to.",

The wine selection was incredible. We started with the Raw Bar Platter and let me tell you if you love seafood well this has about everything you would want!!! Everything taste so fresh as if it came right out of the sea! But most of all the 26 oz cut Ribeye was by far the juiciest, tender, perfectly prepared ribeye I have ever had!! Definitly will be recommending to friends and family for a casual night out or a romantic, special evening!!",

With a slight appetite after seeing the Celine Dion Show with my date, we decided to check out Homestead because as a local in Las Vegas, we have heard a lot of great things about the restaurant.    I am hear to tell all readers that it was a great experience and the food was more than expected.  We had the calamari as an appetizer, the meatball and beet salad for an appetizer, and we ordered the filet mignon and I had the sirloin.  I didnt know that the portions were going to be so huge!    I feel the people who wrote bad reviews should give them another try.  All i have to say is it was worth every second and every dollar.  I am going back again!",

We've eaten at Caesar's twice on our anniversary and couldn't be more pleased so we decided to try Old Homestead this time. We definitely weren't disappointed!  First we ordered the Maine Lobster Bisque as an appetizer. We decided to split a bowl so we could try a little of everything. This was probably a mistake because neither one of us wanted to share! It was so creamy and delicious with just the right amount of lobster.   I am not a beet fan but we decided to get the Roasted Heirloom Beet Salad. I was not expecting to like it one bit but somehow the marrying of the peppery arugula with the goat cheese and the beets won me over. It was a great salad.  We both got the Petite Filet Mignon and were greatly satisfied with it.  They had cooked it perfect to both of our liking.  The flavors were nothing short of a near perfectly cooked and seasoned Filet.    Lastly we had the Big Fat Chocolate Cake and that was a perfect end to our meal.  It had a great taste to it and it was not too sweet.  The cake was also very moist.  Delicious and appealing to the eyes.  All in all, the food was great, atmosphere was what was to be expected at this type of restaurant, and the wait was not too, too long for the food.  I have yet to eat at a True 5 star restaurant, but this place is damn close.",

The variety of complimentary breads and spreads are fantastic! I really enjoyed the pretzel bread! Steak was great and as expected but I wasn't blown away. Don't get me wrong, it was good.  Awkward moment of the night: We were seated at one of the tables along the corridor of the casino where there is alot of foot traffic. As we were finishing our entrees, a Caesar's employee who was walking passed the restaurant, came up to our table and asked if she could have our steak bones for her dog.  She hAd a plastic bag ready for the donation. I thought it was a joke, but she was serious. So to make a good story, we proceeded to give her our bones. I told this to the waiter and he laughed because apparently, this has happened before. Well, it is Las Vegas after all.  Food was good but it's not mind-blowing.",

All surpassed the expectation and before I move on to the meal I'd like to stress that the service here was exceptional. No drink was ever drained without a replacement, no goblet left to be poured or empty plate whisked away all without the slightest intrusion. The staff was knowledgable and very welcoming and the restaurant itself was charming. It is inside the casino and gets a lot of traffic. That's probably the only thing that detracts from its location as it is not at all insulated from the walkway.  We started with Pom martini's, steamed crab legs and beet and house salads. We had strip, Bone in filet and shrimp along with the usual sides. The truffled mashed was so good and really at $28 it should be!  2 orders were polished off and so worth it.  Overall a great experience and really nothing left to be desired. I will miss those truffled mashed here in Chi town and this will go on my rotation went next in Vegas.  Again, I can't explain why it's underrated because as I've mentioned it was a pleasure from service to food and I can't name a highlight in this meal because it was all very good. Will miss it!",

I know it is Vegas, and in Caesars. But....  I was in Vegas for work, and ha da vendor bring me and a few others out to dinner (8 of us total)  The best part of the dinner, was the company and conversation, not the dinner.  Appetizers I will say were top notch. Four types of bread including pretzels, jumbo shrimp the size of lobster tails, and thick cut grille bacon. yum  The steak? Well, I could have bought a $160 steak... but 'settled' for the cheap $62 strip  We got a few 'family style' sides (asparagus, gnocci and tater tots). AS mentioned in my review of Abe and Louies, I like family style sides... but....  So the steak. Wasnt bad, was cooked well, but nothing special. Really, the taste didnt jump out. didnt taste any better than a $20 steak at a 'lesser' restaurant. This was disappointing, as I when I have had steaks at other 'high end' steakhouses, you can TASTE the difference  The 'family style' sides cam eout, tiny. I think 8 strips of asparagus for four people, and the tatertots (which tasted the same as frozen grocery store ones) came in a cone like you would get french fries in at a lot of other places. I was shocked at how small the 'family style' sides were  All in all, it wasnt horrible... but when with a round of drinks, you run up a bill of $1300 for 8 people, you expect a LOT more (and yes, I know I said four above, and now either. our part of 8 was split into two tables, not even next to each other. Another HUGE disappointment, especially considering we had reservations)  People go for the name, go because they arei n Vegas, and pay dearly for both those facts",

Hip, swanky, with a definite touch of class, my lady and I were most satisfied for our date night out on the town.  Let's start with the drink list.  My girl had a tough time choosing between the many options of Martinis, and settled on something very fruity (surprise surprise) but delicious.  I went with a basic Chard as that is the type of night I was in the mood for.  From there we started with the apps.  We decided to go with Shrimp Cocktail and the Kobe Beef Meatball.  The Shrimp Cocktail was resembled NOTHING of the word shrimp.  These things were HUGE and amazingly delicious.  When we laid our eyes on the Kobe Beef Meatball, we soon figured out that it was going to be a night where we were seriously going to eat.  Again, the meatball did not disappoint as the marinara blanketing the pan went perfect with a fork full bite.   Already feeling our stomachs starting to stretch, we decided to share the bone in Rib Eye with potato dumplings and tater tots.  All were off of the hook.  The steak, cooked to perfection, medium soft pink and tender as hell.  The potato dumplings and tater tots (something out of the norm for us) were an added treat to meal.  We caught ourselves gasping for air to fight for room in our tummies while sneaking another bite of a tot.  Top button already blown, you know we had to go with desert!  The GF swears that the ice Cream covered cookie was the best ice cream that she has ever had in her life.   100% we would recommend the Old Homestead to anyone that  wants a nice night out on the town.  Pricey?  Indeed, but worth every cent.  I can't wait to get back to try the seafood platter app, and my girl keeps on hinting on when our next \"date night out,\" will be so she can get back to that ice cream.",

The steak I got was absolutely amazing perfect char on the outside and tender and juicy inside. We also had the mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese, both delightful. Our service was great. The only complaint I have is that the Caesar salad was incredibly fishy. I ended up not even eating that. I would absolutely recommend this place as long as you don't get the Caesar!",

I had the 8oz. filet with the main lobster tail and Oh. My. Gosh. was it delish! It was perfectly cooked, nice and crispy on the outside, just perfect. The lobster was well cooked also. We had a side of asparagus and truffle mac & cheese. Get them both and I promise you won't be sorry. The asparagus was nice and crunchy and the truffle mac and cheese...truffles make everything taste better but hands down the best mac and cheese ever! We also had a bottle of wine with our meal which I forget the name (it was a Pinot), but it was also great. The server was really nice and attentive. He was very knowledgeable about the items on the menu and helped us when it came to choosing the best wine to go with our meal. The atmosphere of he restaurant was a lot more lively than I had thought it would be. When I first heard where we were going, I expected the place to be one of those high class places where everyone whispers there's only a handful of people in the restaurant. Boy was I wrong. There was a long wait list of people waiting to be sat and the restaurant was packed. It honestly made me feel more comfortable to see people having fun and enjoying themselves for dinner. And the fact that our waiter was warm and kind made it all the better. Not sure when I'll be back but I'll definitely be back one of these days. Also, if you go here, make sure to make a reservation!",

Holds its own against the excellent steakhouse competition in Vegas, but doesn't stand out.   They have a traditional steakhouse menu. Various cuts of beef ala carte, sides include potatoes done a few ways, vegetables with lots of butter, and a dressed up mac and cheese.   We had the surf and turf special and a strip steak with an excellent wedge salad and the tater tots w/ fat boy sauce. Everything was excellent, service was great. They skewed both medium and medium well a bit rarer than we expected.  My only complaint was the tater tots. They were a good version of tater tots, but the fat boy sauce was literally just everything you would get with a loaded baked potato put in a side dish for a dipping sauce. The waiter explained this and it sounded exciting, but it didn't work well. Dipping just didn't work and the tater tots were good, but still just a good version of a tater tot, nothing special. I almost got the duck fat fries, I wish I had.  One thing to note is the set of tables that site open right on a main walkway inside the casino. If you like people watching, this works. If you want quiet and intimate, ask for a different table.",

I don't know what u call them but he was the guy that served us the drinks before the actual waiter arrives..... This gentleman was OUTSTANDING!!! He made sure our cups were always filled and without asking gave us a new bread basket with our doggy bag..... That's what u call service..... Our waiter on the other hand was very stiff and unwelcoming..... Again I don't know what u may call it .... But usually people want to feel like they are eating in comfort than at a assembly line for food.... Bottom line .... Food great .... Service could use some work and that's why I gave three stars",

    "text": "We had a wonderful experience here.  We started with the seafood platter and I was pleasantly surprised on how fresh it was.  The platter consisted of oysters, crab and prawns, all which were so delicious.   We also had the kitchen sink salad, crabs cakes, porterhouse for two, mac n' cheese, cream spinach and sauteed mushrooms, yes, were very hungry.    Kitchen sink salad:  It was great, all ingredients worked well together, I enjoyed it.  Crab cakes: Tasty, well seasoned, good quality crab  Porterhouse: Huge, juicy, flavorful, perfectly seasoned and expertly cooked. Came out exactly as I requested- med-rare  Mac 'n cheese: Cheesy, gooey goodness  Creamed spinach: Perfect, just the right amount of cream.  Mushrooms: The were OK.  Dessert:Banana pudding OMG, talk about indulgent! this was a perfect ending to a perfect meal.  Overall, I give this place a four stars because I had a good dinning experience.  From the food to the service, it was great.  I knocked down one star because I didn't like the mushrooms much but one out of 7 is not bad.    I would definitely recommended this  place and for sure we will be back.",

    "text": "I'm being really generous with my review for this restaurant because a)  it is brand new and b) it is one of the few steakhouses that actually knows how to put a good crust on a steak, but it is too bad the quality of the meat doesn't benefit from it.  As people have said this place is massively packed, at least on the weekends.  Making a reservation does not change the fact that you get a table basically when one is open.  It could be immediately or it can be 30 minutes, it depends on how fast people eat.  As for the hostesses, they will treat you badly once you get there.  Except thankfully, due to my ethnic background, I let it be known that I was so annoyed with them about how slow they seat you, that after awhile I scared them into accommodating me - but it was a really tiny table.  As far as the food goes - Chris M was correct, the best thing about eating at Old Homestead is the bread basket.  It is fantastic, and beats the pants out of the steakhouses I've had in town so far.  As far as the rest here is a rundown of what I tried:  Appetizers Caesar Salad - they do it whole leaf style where you knife and fork it.  Good, but nothing that made it stand out.  It's a caesar salad so I didn't expect to be wowed, but it was tasty.  French Onion Soup - this soup usually has some deep flavors when it is cooked properly, such as they do at Marche Bacchus.  Old Homestead's soup is none of that.  It does not taste like they spent a long time developing flavors, and on top of it they mask what little flavor there is with a boatload of sherry that seems like it was added at the end.  But french onion soup is like pizza, where even a bad one is still okay to eat.  If you are picky about flavors I would not order this, but some people will gravitate towards this soup and enjoy it no matter what.  Steaks Bone in Ribeye and Bone in NY Strip - both of these steaks, as I said above had the most amazing char, something I have complained about that is lacking at most steakhouses in town.  My husband and I were so happy to see this.  However, when we both cut into the steak, even though we both ordered medium rare, both steaks were so overcooked that they were about medium well.  It was insanely disappointing.  On top of it, it did not have that aged yummy flavor that most of the high end steakhouses serve when you get these cuts of meat, which made it even more disappointing.  I'm sure if someone ordered a fillet, which doesn't depend on aging for flavor, would have been happy with their dish, had it been cooked at the right temperature. So my recommendation for meat is, order the fillet!  Sides We only ordered one side, and that was the beets.  I can't speak for the more carby sides as I try to avoid that at these places.  Beets aren't that hard to cook, you just put them in tin foil and shove them in the oven for an hour or so.  Apparently, that is a little too hard for Old Homestead and all the beets were undercooked to different degrees.  Some were just raw, but heated up a little.  I would recommend not going to Old Homestead for awhile, until they can get into some groove and  improve on the aging of their steak to compete with some of the other places around town.  If you do go, only order the fillet, but if you crave a ribeye or other steak, go walk over to Carnevino.  The pricing is pretty much the same at both places, outrageous.",

    "text": "Food?  Please.  Quality of product before the culinary challenged get their hands on it? Excellent.  Service? Depends.  I wanted the guy next to the idiot we had. He was so spot on the table next to us gushed over the pretty boy the whole time. There's a million people working the room so kudos to Caesars for helping the UE problem in Las Vegas.  but you would think they could attract all pro staff.  The entrance was an exercise  in never having done this before.  I guess they went we inexperience. Oh? That was the manager?  He was certainly wacky.  Bowtie and all, suit with sneakers, made me feel I was at Chucky Cheese.  Thank goodness when later problems developed we discovered he was only the assistant.  The Big Boss Manager was only slightly wackier.  Always reassuring to have someone talk to you in circles and not fix anything only to come back a second time to not fix anything.    This restaurant is probably an average $100 a head.  More if you're having fun.  Do they crumb tables.  Bread plates and butter on the table when dessert comes? This is a management issue because the  stud next to us crumbed, covered spills with fresh napkins, pulled out chairs.  I thought the one lady was going to F him right there.  WTF?  Were we in the D seats?  We were told the chef came from the Wynn.  Manager from the Wynn.  Waiter from the Wynn.  Have these people been to the Wynn?  Granted I don't like it, it doesn't seem like Vegas to me, but it shines.  These people would be out like poop through a goose.  Oh.  I guess they were and ended up here.  Here's the rub.  We were insiders kind of.  given the scoop to try it out by people inside.  Huh?  Sorry.  Wrong people.  We mostly only write when we've been screwed.  And a great restaurant gets 3 stars and up as it should, not gushing 5 stars every time you have a decent bite.  Did they think we were easy?    Truly not being harsh here.  It sucked.  BUT, the good news is that the place is a few months old and we were told to wait to April when it could be righted.  Coming from the slick dude that told us that we will try, but be warned, if I see any of this crap go down, I will take no prisoners.  Oh forgot to mention the light show.  Amazing.  They play everything from Sinatra to Zeppelin.  All done with flickering lights.  kind of annoying if you're there for dinner.  OH! I see.  It's an electrical malfunction that gets so bright that even my gorgeous girl was exposed under the operating room glow, thank thankfully for me (cause I looked a lot worse I'm sure), suddenly went pitch black.  But I felt better when BOZO the manager clown told us it's been that way since the beginning.  Pesky little lights.  They put man on the moon 45 years ago.  But the light show at Old Homestead is a mystery that has been on for months.  good job guys.  Call us when you become a restaurant.",

My boyfriend and I were celebrating our third year in October 2016, and were debating between Old Homestead and Nobu Sushi. Extremely happy that we chose this steakhouse.   FOOD: We ordered the Bone-In Porterhouse with asparagus and lobster mac and cheese on the side. I can still remember the taste and how perfect it juicy it was. For dessert, we order the creme brulee with some raspberries and blueberries on top; the sweetness and creaminess was not overwhelming and paired well with the berries.   SERVICE: Had the best server. I forgot his name now but he definitely made a huge impact on our evening.   Overall, I would recommend this place and will going back soon!",

Unfortunately this place fits right in with the Kardashian crowd where the core is hollow but facade is big.   The Maitre D' seems to have been a waitress at Applebee's before joining this place and couldn't think or speak straight.  Made us wait for 30 minutes even after we had a reservation.    The waiter didn't bring out the food for 45 minutes not to mention forgetting on of the orders. He even had the gall to mention that we didn't order one of them.   When the pedestrian tasting dishes showed up they were overcooked. Yes, the medium-rare became a medium. And the medium became a medium-well.  Gosh.  Someone left the steaks in the warming drawer too long.   The taste was bad.   Steaks were burnt on the outside and rubberized on the inside.  salads were swimming in dressing and side dishes were full of oil. A weeknight special at a local bar with better looking/speaking waitresses and waiters for 1/4th the price would have been better.    Vegas ding bat service and staff at its best.",

I inquired about their selection of \"Cain\" wines. Austin picked the perfect wine to accent our delicious filet.  Overall you cannot go wrong with Homestead. I prefer Homestead over 'Joes Stone Crab.' The service at Joes stone crab has fallen off the last 8 years.

But I have to disagree with Yelp on this.  Our service was impeccable. From the bar where we started at until we walked up and left our dinner table. The executive chef even popped out and came to our table.  I love a good steak. No sissy steak either. I want a good ribeye or porterhouse. For me a good steak is a nice piece of meat with excellent marbling in it. This just means good flavor and that you are going to have a tender piece of meat. I know some may shoot for me this but I am not a \"fillet mignon\" type of person. However, on this occasion, I knew I was not going to be able to eat a huge steak. I went withe petite \"lady cut\" of fillet.  OMG. They converted me. It was a piece of butter. It ate so well and the flavor delicious.   I added on a crab leg to my steak and it was just like seafood candy. So sweet and delicious.  We also ordered a seafood platter. Fresh & delicious raw oysters and clams. Sweet and succulent shrimp and crab.   Sides of tater tots, mac and cheese, asparagus, broccoli and mushrooms. I would have passed on the broccoli - nothing special. But those tater tots and mushrooms. AMAZING.  Items are expensive. But this place is worth every dollar. Do yourself a favor. Splurge on an expensive bottle of red wine here. Worth every dollar.",

    "text": "Dined here during my last trip to Vegas and it was a bit of a disappointment!! To sum it up...service was great, food was average, and ambiance was poor.   FOOD - If I had to sum it up, it would be just \"okay\". We opted for the 24 oz bone-in ribeye (\"The Gotham\") and a 8 oz filet mignon. The flavor just wasn't there. The filet was undercooked (should have sent it back to be honest) and although the bone-in ribeye was massive, there was more fat on it then I would have liked. What actually saved it for me was the meatball (goes great with their house bread), kitchen sink salad, and French onion soup! I enjoyed both of those appetizers. For sides, we opted for the grilled asparagus and the cheddar potatoes (nothing special). Total came out to about ~$270 (with tip).  SERVICE - Was excellent! Just the right level of \"attentiveness\". I do like how they ask if we wanted items brought out individual or all at once. They also comped my dessert since my birthday was a week prior!  AMBIANCE - It's LOUD. Tables are packed closely together, towards the end of our meal...they sat some loud douchebags next to us. I learned at least 2-3 new expletives (can't put a price on that right LOL). But it just shows how close the tables are. The website listed \"business casual dress code\" as well, but let's just say that was far from the case as well.   Although the portions at Old Homestead are massive (you can easily share the salad & sides with 2-3 people), the overall quality just isn't. I am not really bothered by the price since the terms \"Vegas\", \"Steakhouse\", and Dinner\" never equates to \"CHEAP\". But there are better places in Vegas if you will be paying around $100-150 per person for dinner.   Sorry Old Homestead...as a Total Rewards Player, I frequent many of the Caesars properties but won't be back here...2.5 stars rounding down to 2!  Final Piece of Dirty Donovan Life Advice? Make an early reservation if you want prime rib...because they ran out of it for me (@ 730pm on a Sunday Night)... should have known that was a sign to get up and go eat somewhere else!",

N hostess was so nice--I ride a scooter and she let me use it to get to our table, then took it away for me for the time of the dinner. Hubs and I shared everything. We started with a Seafood Platter appetizer.. so wonderful. Comes on an elevated stand with dry ice smoking away in the middle, very dramatic. The huge shrimp, oysters, lobster tail and King Crab legs were so good. Comes with 4 sauces, all of which I loved (Aside from standard cocktail sauce, don't remember their names). Next was \"kitchen sink\" salad with proscuitto, bleu cheese, tomatoes, etc. Really good, we cleaned our plates. We shared a rib eye, which was very tender, seasoned perfectly, and Yukon gold mashed potatoes, which were a little bit mushy for my taste, but good. For dessert-- since it was our 35th Anniversary-- Michael brought a creme brulee with fresh fruit-- a perfect ending to this very good meal. The wines we had by the glass were very good as well. We now added this to our fave Las Vegas steak houses-- No. 1 is Joe's Steak & Stone Crab;  then Delmonico's, Bavette's; Steakhouse at Circus Circus; and now Old Homestead as well.",

It's not cheap ($49), but it is a once in a lifetime experience, with shrimp larger than your fist, multiple lobster tails and several delicious oysters.   After that, I had a bowl of delicious seafood bisque, and then a 10 oz filet perfectly cooked and exquisitely tender. I also ordered sauteed spinach and lobster Mac and cheese and it is one of my life's great regrets that I was able to finish none of it. Next time, I'm skipping the bisque to be able to enjoy more of the fabulous steak and the rich, over the top lobster Mac and cheese. I'll be working out double time for awhile to work off this dinner but I don't regret a single bite. Delicious.   Service was lovely and they never let my wineglass get too low. Not a single complaint... other than that I did not have room for dessert. Thank you!!",

    "text": "We passed by this restaurant shortly after checking in at Caesar's and it immediately made my hit list.  In another review I freely admitted I am not a Vegas person but when in town for work I am always open to the many restaurant options the city offers.  I am not against the occasional, \"holy crap\" moment when a large bill hits the table for a party of two.  My only requirement is that the experience is equivalent to the number of zeros that end up on my credit card.  I knew going in, this meal would (or should) be on the level of any of the top steak houses I have previously visited.  I still can't understand how a baked potato can possibly cost $15 but I try to let that go.  But damn....It is just a potato!   Okay, back to the meal.  Two thumbs up from my wife with her seafood sampler meal.  She raved about the lobster, shrimp, crab and oyster.  She was a happy camper.  As for mine, I typically go with the filet in hopes of catching lightening in a bottle.  I have had two or three filet's that were the literal \"melt in the mouth\" moment.  Our waiter and another staff member highly recommended the bone-in filet, an additional $10 in which I joked they must be up-selling.  But what the heck, let's go for the $70+ steak.    It was flavorful, but it fell short of the melt in your mouth moment I was hoping for.  In fact, it didn't even crack my top 5.  For the money, you'd be better served driving over to the Golden Nugget and trying Vic & Anthony's Steakhouse.  My personal, all time favorite.  The service was great, and overall the food was enjoyable but the steak fell just a little short for me.  If you are staying at Caesar's and you don't want to travel outside their walls, you'll have a good meal here.  They earned the four stars.  But if you want that elusive 5th star, I need that steak to get into my top 5.",

In what turned out to be a great call, my decision was made based on the Shishito Peppers at Old Homestead.   The most important thing I can say about this place is that the steak was absolutely delicious. If I've had a better steak, I can't recall when. I went with the 14oz New York  Strip and it was absolutely a thing of beauty. It literally melted in my mouth like cotton candy. For my sides I had the aforementioned Shishito Peppers which were dynamite and the Yukon Gold mashed potatoes which were amazing as well.   While Old Homestead is fairly upscale, I've definitely had finer dining experiences and especially in Vegas. You get nice, but not pretentious here. I liked my seat along the perimeter which provided views of all the happenings inside Caesars and some exceptional people watching opportunities.   Services, sides, bread bowls, drinks and atmosphere aside, the steak is where I place the highest value. Old Homestead has mastered the process. If your desire is a phenomenal steak, you will not be disappointed.",

We ordered a cap ribeye and ribeye wagyu. The meats are tender but the chef completely kill it! The meats were burnt so it taste very bitter and very salty. We saddle gave up on our meals. I don't have the courage to take any further bite.  Second, the fois gras was over cooked. The outside skin was hard and taste like rubber. Third, the creamy corn texture were liquid not creamy. Lastly, my cocktail shrimped were also hard like rock because it over over cooked too.  Wasted over $300. We ended up getting a bowl of Pho by Treasure Island hotel to filled up our stomach. We don't recommended this place.",

    "text": "So underwhelmed, so disappointed.   My date and I went to here for dinner before going to see James Taylor in concert. I read the reviews before making the reservation and most were quite good. Sadly, that would not be our experience.  The waiter, Bradley, was overly saccharine and frankly annoying. It would only get worse from there.  We ordered the shrimp cocktail as an appetizer. I saw a picture of it from one of the reviews and it looked great (huge shrimp hanging over the edge of a large ice fill glass, you know the visual). When ours arrived, it was such a sad presentation. 4 \"not so big\" shrimp tossed in an ice filled metal cup. While they tasted ok, for $30 you would think someone could take the time to assemble the dish to look good as well (not to mention having appropriately sized shrimp). This is not a Sizzler.   My date ordered the $71 bone-in fillet. I ordered a $35 hamburger (it sounded amazing from the description on the menu). I was not bothered by the cost of either, I only mention it as a point of reference and expectation. We have had far more expensive meals and I am happy to pay the price if the food is prepared correctly and the service top notch. The fillet was dry, overcooked, and lacked any real seasoning. My burger arrived as a soggy mess completely overwhelmed by the cheese that was used and had very little flavor beyond that. In their defense, they did get it to the requested \"medium-rare\". The only saving grace was that the \"duck-fat\" fries as they were delicious. We both ate most of those, but the fillet and burger were only half eaten and that was only because we were very hungry and didn't have time for any other food before the show.   Bradley had all but disappeared after the meal was served (it was someone else that brought the food). When we were finally able to get Bradley's attention, I let him know that we were disappointed with our meal. He feigned understanding and concern. He half heartedly offered to find the manager, but we were already running late and needed to leave for the show. He just brought us the bill, no adjustments or added apology.   I would STRONGLY suggest not dining here. I have eaten at a number of casino restaurants in town (I am a Vegas local) and have had great meals and wonderful service. How this place got everything so wrong (food and service) is difficult to understand. Save yourself some grief and find another place for dinner.",

The service was phenomenal! The waiter did everything he could to switch a few things to make it right but finally, we gave up. It was bad quality meat, the spinach was very sad, the chocolate cake was not nice, and the red w. sauce was burnt and way over powered by what seemed like vinegar (which I don't think should be an ingredient in this one).  :( Nonetheless, the ambiance was nice but spoiled by the food. Cant imagine how much it would have been if we had chose to have alcohol instead of Perrier.  Iv bought better meat (aged) at the local market. The best up side: Bernaise sauce-lol... sorry but two thumbs down for this one.",

I had my wife verify my sense that the wine had gone off and she acknowledged that it had.  The Sommelier debated our findings immediately, without even smelling or tasting the wine herself. I then had my niece taste the wine and she agreed the wine was bad. The Sommelier then remarked that Stag's Leap wine tastes that way and she didn't understand how anyone would like Stag's Leap.  For a meal that averaged $100 per person, one would expect far better food, better service and a much better presentation. As for dining in Las Vegas, Old Homestead Steak House has now set a new low water mark with us.",

We were in the mood for a light, late dinner and drinks (after a long day of Vegas-style overindulgence) and we were seated quickly (it was around 9.30). Our server was at our table immediately and he was incredibly knowledgeable and friendly. He suggested different wines for us to try (the cab cab cab wine flight is lovely) and checked in on us often.  The entire staff was really friendly and the customer service as a whole was outstanding. I was especially impressed because this IS a new restaurant and yes, it was busy, and, as we were doing salads, appetizers and dessert, I'm sure we were not our server's most profitable table, but he made us feel like we were his only table. He was funny, took his time with us and answered questions about the menu without professing his undying love for each and every dish.  The highlight was definitely dessert; we ordered the big fat chocolate cake and a warm chocolate chip cookie. They were definitely steak house staples, but done exceptionally well (the cake is finished with chocolate ganache and the cookie was topped with ice cream rolled in chocolatey crunchy pieces--super yummy). Overall, we had a great experience; especially for Vegas where I feel that customer service is a dying art.  I couldn't have asked for more and the next time we are in town we will definitely revisit.",

    "text": "Positives:  The management, the lobster mac-n-cheese. Negatives:  Bad attitude at the hostess stand, mediocre steaks.  Service:  We made reservations using Open Table at the Old Homestead for our 10th anniversary dinner on Saturday, May 16th.  When we approached the hostess stand to check in, it took a few minutes for the blonde hostess to even acknowledge our presence and make eye contact.  We were told our table wasn't currently ready and for us to wait in the near area - we would be called when we would be seated.  Wait was not long (about 10 minutes), but because of our initial experience at the hostess stand, we kept a sharp eye on the activity at the stand.  When we were finally called, the brunette hostess called my name, but we couldn't hear it even though we were less than 10 feet away.  She did not walk away from the stand to see if we were one of the many customers waiting for a table, she just moved on to another ticket/reservation for seating. Luckily our attention to the activity meant that we read her lips and could tell she called for us and arrived before she called the next reservation.    When she (the brunette hostess) brought us to our table, she was going to seat us wedged between the server station, the bar, and directly next to  the hostess station.  We immediately asked if we could be seated elsewhere since we didn't want to be so close to all that activity (it was our anniversary after all, and I indicated as much in my reservation).  She said no, she could not seat us elsewhere, but we were welcome to go back to waiting for a table.  We pointed to a nearby table of the same size (4 top) that was empty and asked why we couldn't have that one.  She said it was reserved.  I responded that we also had a reservation - why couldn't we have that table?  She became argumentative quickly and said flatly that she would not re-seat us.  Wanting to avoid any further interaction with this unhelpful person, I asked for the manager.  He met with us quickly and immediately understood our concerns, re-seating us in a booth nearby but out of the busy intersection where our initial table was located.  He treated us to champagne as an apology, and also generously sent over creme brulee after our dinner.    We appreciated the helpfulness and respect that the manager afforded us, but our initial interactions with the hostess stand really set the tone for our dinner that we couldn't shake.    Food:  Please keep in mind that this is very much an East Coast styled steakhouse.  If you are from Texas (like me), you may find that you don't get the flavor or experience you may be used to.  For our appetizers we ordered the wedge salad which had way too much bleu cheese and the lobster bisque which had a nice presentation but average flavor.  For our sides we ordered steamed asparagus (perfectly steamed) and duck fat fries (not much difference from Cisco fries).  We also ordered the lobster mac-n-cheese which was AMAZING.  This was definitely the highlight of our culinary experience here.  Our main course was the prime porterhouse for two, which for $120 really should have had more flavor and been less chewy.  About 1/3 of the whole steak was cooked to our preference of medium-rare.  The rest varied from almost raw to well-done.  Some of it was so chewy that I wondered if my jaw was going to give out.  The crust overall needed more salt.  Basically I felt we probably should have gone with ordering something we didn't have much expertise with so we wouldn't have been so critical.  Overall:  Definitely MEH.  Pay attention to the negative reviews if you have high expectations of this place.  You are better off going somewhere else - unless you are going for lobster mac.",

Well, I didn't do any drinking but everyone else did more than make up for my shortcomings in that category! Anyways, the finale night dinner on Sunday found us here. It was probably a good thing we had a reservation. The place was packed and I heard it was booked fairly solid for this particular weekend. It's located across from Nobu and resides in the spot Nero's used to occupy I believe. The restaurant consists of dimmed lights and a classy looking decor. Prices seemed about on par for a steakhouse on the Strip. If  I remember correctly, Old Homestead originates from New York. The bread basket is crazy, for starters. Loaded basket. Pretzel bread, mini dinner roll with coarse salt on top, crusty mini french roll and bacon, asiago & cheddar muffin. My buddy asked for extra butter and I guess they remembered because on our second bread basket we got these two massive blocks of butter along with it. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful. Drinks were filled constantly and we were checked on a few times to see if we needed anything else. I had the 16oz filet mignon on the bone. Cooked and seasoned perfectly. We shared sides of potato gnocchi with truffle butter, asparagus & mushrooms. Loved the asparagus and the gnocchi. The gnocchi was so rich with the truffle butter. For our party of five. We were suggested that three sides would be enough since the portions are fairly large. When we saw them, they didn't seem that 'large'. We probably could have gone with four, or even five and been ok. Considering we demolished the sides we had ordered. Suffice to say we all left full and satisfied. Anything less would be a disappointment when you pay this much for good food. Solid 4 stars.",

Refused the new steak and left very disappointed, do they really want me to believe there wasn't another filet mignon cooking that they could have intercepted for me, you know I was very willing to pay over $100 for my dinner but won't return do to lack of service.",

    "text": "We had a great meal at Old Homestead.  We were able to get a table for 6 in 15 minutes using OpenTable.  Drinks were very good, Moscow Mules were perfect.  We tried an 8oz Fillet Mignon, 12oz Fillet, a 38pz Bone in \"Lollipop\" Rib Eye (for 2), and a burger with one of the best buns(house made brioche) and the largest (8oz), juiciest, fattiest, and most flavorful burger patty I have eaten.  The burger was served simply with aged Tillamook cheddar and caramelized onions and a side of duck fat fries.  Fries were good but came in somewhere between naked fries and the battered frozen kind.  Not to say that these were anything close to frozen but they did seem to have a little bit of a coating, I prefer naked fries.  The 4 cheese mac and cheese was great as were the cheddar potatoes gratin, both served in small cast iron skillets.  Grilled asparagus had just the right amount of char on the outside and were perfectly trimmed and cooked, just enough snap left in them to give them that perfect texture.  The only knock on the asparagus was the size, wish they had been a bit smaller.  The bread basket to start was an assortment of fresh and wonderful small rolls.  French onion soup was killer, not too salty, and just the right temperature (whether this is the intent I'm not sure) where you can dig in almost immediately without burns.  Beet salad was nice, earthy, and salted well.  Bearnaise was a good addition to the steaks and asparagus.  Service was what you would expect at a steakhouse at this price point, friendly, efficient, knowledgeable, thorough, but not overly attentive.  Service was on point.  At a $100+/person our group thought it was well worth splurging.",

Was feeling a little down but between the Logo and trademark COW ,I was like yum!! NEW YORK!!! But that's a different story.          Anyways I wasn't sure at first because we didn't make reservations and I wanted to be casual and fun but and not get loud or (too drunk) haha. Turned 22 so was somewhat uncomfortable lol.                                                  Usually like to sit in a booth or back table. But wow once I had a few sips of the scotch all my insecurities went out the door. Ha. Night to remember for sure. Had the lamb but I wanted to order a few apps and  entrees to share. What I have wanted to be there all night and keep the food coming? SURE but pocket and belly said that's probably not the smartest. Ha hence the drive back. If anyone is craving steak and want to avoid walking around too much this is the place.",

    "text": "Before the Seinfeld show, I came here for dinner.  I was seated in a great area that gave me some privacy but I still had a view of the tourists walking by as they went down the hallway toward the Nobu Hotel section of Caesars.  My server was Roque and he was excellent throughout my time there.  He was at the table quickly with menus and taking my drink order.  He made some recommendations and I had some questions about the size of different items on the menu.  In the end, I opted for the 16 ounce bone in filet and an order of duck fat fries.  I asked for the steak to be extra rare.  A bit later, Roque returned and asked if I wanted the steak seared on each side.  The bread service was good with two kinds of bread--mini loaves of salted topped herb bread and two baguette rolls.  The butter was unsalted but the salt on the one loaf made up for it.  My iced tea was brought promptly and it was always refilled without asking throughout the time I was there.  Empty sweetener packs were removed quickly.  The steak was brought and it had an excellent char and was beautifully rare.  It was also a very flavorful steak.  The duck fries were seasoned well but there was nothing out of the ordinary with them.  I really wanted to pick up the bone and gnaw some more meat off but I decided against that.  I ordered doughnut bread pudding for dessert.  They make doughnuts every day, cool them, pull them apart, mix them back together with the liquid necessary to form bread pudding and bake it in a ring.  Later, it's reheated, topped with caramel sauce and a dollop of vanilla bean ice cream.  It was very good and a great way to end a meal.  There's no reason to mess around with an appetizer when you can save room for the sweet ending!  Roque came back several times during the meal to see if everything was OK and to check to see if I needed anything.  He learned that I was a local and we had some small talk about things to do around Las Vegas that make this place such a wonderful place to live--like hiking to work off a meal.  This was a good meal.  It's definitely Strip pricing and Caesars pricing, too, which makes it more than some other steakhouses of equal quality in the resort corridor.",

    "text": "My mouth is watering just thinking about the dinner I had here last Saturday night. Not sure why this place doesn't have higher ratings, but my group and I had a great meal. The food was pricey but well worth it; indulgent but not over the top. We made no reservation and walked in for an early 5:30pm dinner. The wait was about 5 minutes.  Between our table of three, we split:  1. Complementary basket of bread and butter - This came with some pretzel bread and a variety of rolls; the butter was fresh and creamy.  2. \"The Meatball\" - Topped with ricotta cheese in a pool of marinara sauce, this beast was a 14oz ball of tender meat, perfectly cooked, flavorful, and juicy. Imagine a meatball the size of your two fists put together, sizzling on a hot skillet.  3. The 38oz \"Lollipop\" Rib Eye for Two - Not sure how 2 people could finish this on their own cause it's a lot of meat. We requested medium rare, and it came out perfectly. Just the right amount of red and completely tender. Flavorful yet simple, classic steak with just enough fat, and probably one of the best cuts of meat I've had (if not the best). And as a Texan girl, I've had a lot of steak in my life.   4. Old Homestead sauce flight - All of these sauces were delicious. Even the horseradish cream, which is a flavor I typically despise, was palatable-- creamy and buttery in consistency, not too harsh of a horseradish flavor. These sauces were a great compliment to the meat, albeit unnecessary since the steak was great on its own.  5. Truffle mashed potatoes - Perfect. Get it. No regrets.   6. Duck fat fries - Crispy, fresh, delicious contrast in texture to the mashed potatoes we ordered. Our table loved potatoes and both of these were great selections.  7. Warm apple cobbler - aka warm apple heaven. We almost turned down dessert since we were stuffed but I'm glad we made room for it. This was the best dessert I've had in a while. Great size for sharing. Not too sweet. The apples were baked through just the right amount. And the cider sorbet topping was so so so so good and was a nice refreshing way to cleanse the palate after all the indulgent dishes.  To top that off, the hostesses were friendly and so was our waiter. Casual, trendy ambiance without being snooty. All in all, this was a great Vegas dinner experience. Can't wait to come back.",

This place just goes to show how the hospitality industry had completely lost sight of what matters (and why Caesar's has filed bankruptcy twice - the standards are less than ideal).

I was dismissed and treated with complete disregard by Daisy when asked to be seated for drinks and a modest dinner in a very empty restaurant. Her lack of friendliness and attentiveness completely left a bad taste in my mouth. I was in a convention all day and wanted a quick bite yet I wasn't able to sit in the totally dead restaurant. Its a testament to why restaurants need to value customers and stop acting entitled and Daisy? Should be fired, totally unprofessional and unaware of what service means.",

It was delicious with a very impressive presentation.   -My husband had the Japanese Wagyu steak and it was the best we've ever had! It melted in our mouths. I believe it came with potatoes and mushrooms. He also got a side of asparagus which we enjoyed.   -I got the surf and turf with an 8oz filet and lobster tail. The lobster was delicious and my filet was cooked perfectly. I also ordered the lobster Mac and cheese and it was my least favorite thing that we ordered. It wasn't bad, it's just my personal taste that I don't enjoy super thick cheese, but I know many people do.   From start to finish (hostesses to everyone who came to our table) it was a very pleasant dining experience. Oh and we were able to charge the dinner to our room since we were staying at Caesars.

The atmosphere is very relaxed and classy. We sat at the bar before dinner and the bartender was very helpful and friendly. He made me a perfect vodka martini so good I had to have two.  We were seated quickly and the server greeted us right away. He was very attentive through the meal all of his suggestions were on point. We started with the  roasted onion soup and the Yellowfin tuna  sashimi both were great. We then had the Filet Mignon for two perfectly prepared. We paired the meal with a nice bottle on Silver Oak Cab. and finished the meal with their world famous cheesecake! I will definitely make this a regular stop when I am on the strip. With all the steakhouses in Vegas this one is worth trying out.",

My favorite side is the mac and cheese.  This is my go to restaurant every time I'm in Vegas. I always try a new restaurant at least one of the nights but always enjoy Old Homestead the most.",

    "text": "This restaurant has an inviting, warm interior. You are given a nice selection of bread rolls to start. We ordered the jumbo shrimp cocktail as an appetizer and it was delicious! The shrimp were huge and the cocktail sauce was perfect. My husband and I shared the 16 oz ribeye along with the Yukon mashed potatoes and bacon creamed spinach. The steak was perfectly cooked and extremely tender. The mashed potatoes were creamy and delicious. Creamed spinach is one of my favorite things to eat at a steakhouse and this one didn't disappoint. Our server, Joe, was attentive and continuously checked in on us to be sure we didn't need anything. We ordered the creme brulee for dessert and it was served with fresh berries and whipped cream. Unfortunately, the creme brulee was a bit disappointing as it didn't have a nice hard sugar topping. It tasted good, but there is nothing better than cracking into a nice crunchy sugar topping. All in all, I would highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a classic steakhouse experience.",

The woman taking care of drinks and bread was quite good. The waiter mixed up our order because he didn't write it down. I ordered a burger and asked not to have the foie gras butter but he forgot.  The French onion soup was good but not worth $17. The burger was bad. It didn't have much flavor and was cold and uncooked in the center. The fries were great.  The steak was tasty and well seared.  Overall I think Joe's Crab Shack and Steaks in the attached mall was much better all around.",

    "text": "Went here with a group of 10 after being turned away at the Bacchanal Buffet. It was 8:30p and would likely have been seated right around closing. We opted to give this place a try since they could accommodate us right away.   The service was pretty a good, so low star rating reflects the food. Mind you, I'm only speaking for my wife and I, not the other 8 guests.   My wife had the Filet Mignon with creamed corn and I had the OH Burger.  She's not much of a steak aficionado but she was truly underwhelmed by her Filet Mignon. The high price raised expectations, and she felt truly let down.  She thought it was very dry.  The creamed corn was just okay.  I sampled that and thought, meh, not bad.    Now, the OH Burger was a complete train wreck. For $35, my expectations were EXTREMELY high. I was very disappointed, not only in the taste, but also in the presentation.  It was a greasy ass burger sitting on a white plate with some ketchup on the side.  What? It did NOT come with lettuce, tomatoes and onions. I had to ask for it. What?  $35?  What? The bun was EXTREMELY greasy. It literally fell apart after the first bite. I couldn't even finish the damn thing, it was so bad. I was yearning for an In-n-Out Burger!  Hell, I would have settled for Big Mac. Grass fed my ass!  If you're in Vegas and are looking for steak, you might want to consider elsewhere. If you want a burger...well you know how I felt about the burger.  One of our guests ordered the Sole, which looked awesome!  That's one to try if end up here.  Another guest ordered the scallops and thought they were too salty.  Two guests ordered the rib eye, which looked pretty good, so maybe that's worth a try as well.  I'm still disappointed we didn't get into the Bacchanal Buffet!",

    "text": "Seriously one of the best rib-eye steaks I've ever had, and I'm not a steak person.  Baked potato was good sized and cooked to perfection.  Loved the little mini-trays of cheese, sour cream, bacon bits, etc to embellished as I please.  The Caesar Salad was excellent, but I think they were confused when we asked if they could add some chicken.  They basically sliced a chick breast on placed in on top of the salad.  It wasn't bad, just different I guess.  Only thing we did not like is where we were seated.  We were in a table to two a long the main route the servers pass with food making it a little noisy, but bearable.  The problem was when a couple sat at the table right above us on the next level a few inches higher with their backs to our table.  I could have probably given them a back rub from where I sat.  There server was so loud, and of course facing us, we couldn't have a conversation until he left.  Problem was, he came back a lot and was very chatty.  He was obviously having a good time with his guests, but we almost felt we were sitting with the help them couples back on one side and the servers continuously walking back and forth and the other.  However, dang that rib-eye was amazing!!  Pretty much makes up for everything I said above.  We'll be back during our next trip, will just ask for another place to sit.",

My husband was creeped out cause the gal that would come around d to fill the water glasses would sneak up next to him without saying a word  it scared him every time.  The wine selection is nice.  The beet salad was good.  The steak was crusty and flavorful on the outside.  It was cooked unevenly however.  One half was medium like I ordered and the other half was more well done and a little tough.  The creamed spinach was very flavorful.  We ordered a sauce flight with our steak which didn't arrive with out steak.  Our waiter brought it later after we brought it to his attention.  It was taken off our bill which we appreciated.  Overall dinner was good and if staying at Caesar's Palace I would consider eating here again but I have had better in Vegas.",

We didn't have to wait, even on a busy weekend...and the place was still crowded which is always a good sign.   Appetizers: We ordered the oysters Rockefeller, which I love...but these one's here had way too much sauce. I'm not an oyster fan, so sauce for me is a must...but they had just too much. Otherwise it was okay.  Dinner: I ordered the filet mignon, which came out perfect. I asked for medium well and it was cooked with just enough pink and very well seasoned so no complaints with the main dish. As a side my husband and I split the lobster mac and cheese. This is where I had my biggest issue. I love mac and cheese just as much as anybody else, especially when it's thick and cheesy...but this place served the most overly rich mac and cheese I've ever tasted. It was borderline sour how rich it was, and it was grossly creamy. I couldn't taste the lobster either. I'd pass on this, sadly.  Desert: We ordered the cookie with ice cream. It was okay, just a little too much caramel and chocolate sauce.  Overall, this place is good. The savior was the main course, which is what we came for in the first place. The sides could use some work though.",

The fried calamari was OK but I've had better. My check including a soda was $133.  I was alone but the price didn't shock me. The steak for its size and quality can be beaten by Jerry's Nugget. Jerry's will hit you for 29 bucks for a far superior piece of meat. But the rent at Caesars along with the NYC name have to be paid for. So this is what you get. I won't be back unless you're paying for it. The waiter was a nice guy and that's why a two star got boosted to a three",

It was a little loud my dreams and I had to practically yell to communicate. I miss the bread with craisins in it, it was my favorite. Overall great food.",

Chocolate dessert was the perfect choice to close the perfect dining experience. Manager came to our table to check our experience with a great touch of class.   definitely will be back.",

    "text": "My experience was very underwhelming here.  I'll start with the good because there are some good things about our dinner.  It was our anniversary dinner and we noted that on our reservation.  The hostess and the waiter were both aware of our special occasion.  The waiter and his assistant were very attentive throughout our meal.  Service is probably a solid 4 to 4.5 stars.  The food is not special.  I completely understand that there is only so much you can do with a steak.  However, if am paying premium pricing to eat at steakhouse, I am expecting Mastros level of quality and presentation.  And giving the price, I want the restaurant to pay attention to the details. For example, the steak knife.  I want a blade that extends through the entire handle.  But more importantly, it MUST NOT be a serrated knife. What the hell?!?! This absolutely ruined my dining experience.  With that being said, the bone in ribeye was fine.  Cooked as ordered.  The sides were nothing to write home about. The portions for the sides are fairly small and just not that great.  Overall food score is a 3.  Although we did not intend on having dessert, the waiter surprised us with a complimentary creme brulee. This was a class move.  The creme brulee is a good one.  Worth paying for!    There are other great steak options in Vegas. Caesars could have done better on this.",

The hostess and waiter were awesome, and the manager even came to the table to make sure everything was fantastic. The hostess even knew a lot about the history of the first NYC location, which was amazing. Ruth's Chris's loss was our gain. Thanks for a great night !  Gregory Leder",

The First Course was Caesar Salad or French Onion soup. We both had the salads and they were good.   The main course was an 8oz. Black Angus filet which included 1 large shrimp scampi, on top, and a potato cake underneath. My steak was just OK but my wife's was not cooked right and had to be sent back. The shrimp scampi was rather over cooked and tough. The \"potato cake\" was also not really very good. It was kind of tasteless and really tough which is hard to imagine.   The dessert course was Creme Brulee which was really the high-lite of the meal. It was one of the best we have ever had.",

As a Vegas local, we hardly ever make it to the Strip for dinner (even for special occasions) however, that will change because this place was outstanding and worth every penny.  We were sat at a booth where we could see the crowds of people walking by so it was nice to do a little bit of people watching while sipping our wine and relaxing. The service was nothing less than stellar; met and exceeded our expectations for the entire meal. Now the meal...THE MEAL....was amazing! We ordered way more food than we needed to because it all sounded so good. It was literally THE best steak that I have ever had.  Not to be outdone by the steak but do yourself a favor and get the chocolate cake for dessert...YOU'RE WELCOME!  Next time you are in Vegas or if you are local, try Old Homestead. It is a great spot for special occasions or if you just want a fabulous meal with great service.",

    "text": "Below average in more than one category. Massive steak portions. As one example the prime rib I believe is 34 oz, but you can't get a smaller size.  Another example is the 26 oz. ribeye.  It's kind of a \"Heart Attack Grill\" methodology for the portion sizes, except the HAG has beef that is really flavorful, unlike this place!  I ended up getting the 8 oz petite filet since I didn't want to gorge.....cooked exactly as I asked, but nothing remarkable to write home about. As an appetizer, I had the French onion soup.  There was some annoying sweet taste in the soup, which overwhelmed  any other flavor.  The cheese topping the soup was tasteless.  My friend had the colossal shrimp cocktail, and it was massive....only 2 shrimp, and at least the presentation gets an A+.  For $27, I would expect a lot from a shrimp cocktail! For prices, I believe the petite filet was $52, beers were $12, horseradish sauce $5, and the French onion soup was $14.....with the Total Rewards card discount.  Service was very good, but you won't feel pampered here.  Oh Caesars, why did you ever replace Neros Steakhouse with this place?",

We arrived and were promptly seated, I noticed nothing wrong with the host/customer service, although I really wasnt paiyng attention to the host.   We ordered the Rib Eye and NY strip, along with calamari, a beet salad, onion rings, mac n cheese and creamed spinach. The food was decent nothing super special nor was it bad. I mean the calamari was good and I liked the sides, the steak was good. I've had better steak, but it is what it is.  We ended our meal with coffee and the Key Lime pie and the pie was tasty. My husband really enjoyed this place so we will be back next time we are in Vegas.   Con: Our waiter was off a bit, he wasnt to pleasant.",

That's when we saw The Old Homestead restaurant. So glad they had availability. Best decision ever to eat there. We started with oysters Rockefeller. They were delicious and came with five nice size oysters. Then we moved on to our main course. We both got the petite (lady's cut) filets, medium rare. WOW. Ranks in my top five steaks of all time. It has a wonderful char on the outside but was perfectly medium rare on the inside. Tender and juicy. I ate the whole thing, which hardly ever happens. I also had mine topped with blue cheese which was delectable. For the side we had lobster Mac and cheese, which was the special that night. Creamy with lots of lobster and cheese. It was a huge portion. The two of us couldn't finish it. The wait staff was exceptional, really attentive and friendly. We had Charles for our waiter, you should ask for him.  Although I'm sure any waiter/waitress you get will be great. We were too full for dessert but the menu was extensive and sounded amazing. They have Baked Alaska which I've been dying to try. Was just too full. You will not be disappointed in this restaurant. Unless you like well done steaks, in which case I'm not sure you should even be allowed to eat steak.",

We both had the server recommended bone in ribeye, they were great along with the gnocchi.  Be prepared to spend a fair amount of money for this meal. We also got pictures taken so they really know how to stretch your dollar.  Being a Total Rewards member takes a little off the bill so well worth joining TW.  Pics came out great and we had a nice dinner to remember.  Try to get a seat far away from the entrance since you are in Ceasar's it can be kinda loud up front.  Bottom line great steak, nice ambiance, great service.  I'd give it five stars but wasn't impressed with the appetizer. Was a little surprised dress code isn't required but this is Vegas.",

I had to stop myself from eating all of them because I needed room for my entree lol  I ordered the 8 oz petite filet mignon cooked medium rare and that was the best piece of steak that I have ever had.  So tender and juicy.  I'm drooling just thinking about it.  haha.  I would highly recommend their steaks.  My friend and I shared the broccoli & cheddar side and it was alright.  Nothing special with their sides.  I would just stick to their steaks.  It's a bit pricy but you get what you paid for.  P.S. Make reservations early as you can.",

From the moment we were seated we felt like VIPs. Gary the manager was very helpful with all of the  questions we had and gave us a fantastic meal selections. Kevin our food server was not only knowledgeable but externally interactive with us. All of our courses were cooked perfectly and we will certainly recommend this restaurant to all of our family and friends.",

My steak was good, but everything about this place is over-priced. $15 for sides? Come on, that's really pushing it. Maybe at Per Se, where extras for suckers have become one of their mainstays. Mushrooms or spinach, 15?? I think it's 10 for mushrooms in NYC. Okay, I get it, Vegas....BUT, I have been eating prime rib for fifty years at the old joint in the meatpacking district. So, I was looking forward to it. Guess what? And I received a lengthy vertical integration financial analysis of why they don't have it and are not even allowed to give it away. TMI? I just wanted my prime rib, an end cut. Well, not here. I had an adequate New York, sliced. With wine and tip this place is super expensive pp. But, its Vegas, and really these restaurants with their venerable names as well as all the celebrity-chef places are just branding. Never the same as the real deal. If I didn't know which restaurant I was in, I could not tell you if Emeril, Mario's, Daniel's or anybody else's was on the entrance.",

I had the Filet Mignon on the Bone and it was cooked to perfection. It was a bit fatty but that's to be expected when you order something on the bone.   I got the duck fat fries- at first I was intimidated to try it but after the waiter recommended it. I built up the courage to order it. It was so delicious. I don't think that it's cooked completely in duck fat, but the flavors were spot on. Probably the best fries I've had in a while.  Then for dessert, I had the creme brulee, (since I don't like chocolate and I was craving for some fruits). So freaking delicious.   I can't get over how delicious this place is, and I would go back in a heartbeat. The waiters there truly made my experience memorable. They were knowledgeable of their menu and didn't make me feel inferior to them (like some places do when you seem out of place.)   If you're looking for steakhouse on the strip, this is the place to go to.",

Awesome server - timely and efficient.    The bone in ribeye is the best I've ever had.  Pricing takes a bit to get used to.  $150 for a 4 oz. Kobe steak.....but actually worth it.  The attention to detail was apparent throughout.   Rarely, if ever, would I rubber stamp a recommendation, but Homestead has earned it.  Any place that makes Mastro's mediocre,  has my business for life.   Fantastic!!!",

We had five tables in a semi-private room and it was nearly an hour before our salad courses were served and another long delay before entrees were served and dessert service was equally slow.  But slow wasn't all that was wrong with the service.  Table clearing was erratic, no one inquired about the food served and they seem more interested in telling stories than listening to what their patrons wanted.  The food sounds great on the menu, but don't count on what you get resembling the menu.  A salad with tomato and hearts of palm had 1 cherry tomato cut in half and a section of palm heart less than 1/2 inch cut into thin slices.  The rest was fancy lawn clipping in a vinegary dressing.  The steak au poivre tasted ok and the prep was fine, but the chicken breast with fingerlings was dreadful.  I could have used the chicken breast as a dessicant for a shipping container.  I only tasted the chocolate cake and it was completely without merit.   Enough - don't need to beat a dead horse (although it might have been better than the chicken).",

I'm glad to say I was not disappointed.  I'm from Texas and know exactly how a steak should taste so I was impressed by the way my steak was made. I ordered the 14 oz New York Sirloin done medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. It was quite large so maybe order an appetizer and split an entree and get desert like my wife and I did. The calamari was some of the best I ever had and for dessert we went with the creme brulee.   After the meal was done the total came out to a little under $150 for the both of us which is not bad at all to me compared to some fine steakhouses I've been to.

After we sat down our waiter came and greet us then took our drink order, we had a short conversation during the order, he was very friendly and made us felt welcome. I have tried so many steak house, I can really say if anyone loves bread, i highly recommend the garlic bread for appetizer, the texture was amazing, and served with the just right temperature.   Our main courses are lollipop rib eye and petite filet Mignon, the portion was defiantly worth your money, and the meat quality was fantastic, and we also order 2 side dishes,cream & 4 cheeses and sauteed asparagus, it was all a perfect combination!!!  Then we were actually very filling but we have to try the desserts, at least one!!!   so we ordered the NY style cheese cake, it was very creamy but light, our waiter recommended cappuccino to go with our cheese cake and it was absolutely delightful.  over all we had a great dinner and great service, and YES I do highly recommend for celebration and romantic dinner for this place, great experience!!",

    "text": "By far, without a question, the best steakhouse in Vegas.  It is a very close approximation of its sibling in NYC's meatpacking district.  Stop counting calories for an evening.  You must go into it with no concern about the money.  This is an expensive restaurant, and the food and service are both worth it.  Expect to spend $300 for a big dinner for two with drinks and dessert.  Again, WORTH IT.  Each cut of meat is meticulously prepared and perfectly cooked.  The vegetables and sides are outstanding. Unleash your inner child and order the tater tots fat boy sauce.  I ate at Old Homestead not long after it opened earlier this year, and then again yesterday.  The new management is an enormous improvement, and the service is even better than it was before.  Ask for Charles.  He is outstanding, and his New York accent completes the experience.",

    "text": "In Vegas for work, looking for something vegan ... most steakhouses have great veggie sides and I was not disappointed at Old Homestead.  I ordered the heirloom beet salad - without goat cheese - wow, it was so good!  Perfectly prepared beets and the vinaigrette was nice and tangy.  For my \"entree\" I ordered a side of mushrooms, broccoli, asparagus, and the roasted corn - outstanding.  The corn was definitely the best, the others were pretty standard fare.  Minus a star for no vegan entree (not a surprise though) and no dessert.  Most places at least have a sorbet.  Pricey, yes ($100+ for my meal, plus 2 glasses of wine!), but it is a nice place, great ambiance, even dining solo at the bar.  Kudos to the staff for not making me feel lame for ordering just veggies in a steak place.  They were very kind & accommodating.  Much appreciated!",

    "text": "You get what you pay for, and in this case the high prices get you very high quality food and service.  My wife and I had eight-ounce sirloins with shared sides of asparagus and grilled mushrooms, with glasses of Napa Cellars Merlot.  The food was absolutely perfect, the kind of meal you linger over so you can enjoy every slow bite.  We both thought maybe we'd tasted better steaks at some point in our lives, but we couldn't put our fingers on just when or where.  I don't think it's possible to cook asparagus better than this, just the right amount of crunch and no woodiness in the stems.  The deserts are enormous, my wife had the Big Fat Chocolate cake and I had Apple Strudel and neither of us could finish, the leftover cake made a nice snack back in our hotel room the next day.  Service was top-notch, our waiter was attentive but not intrusive, and he knew every detail of how each dish was prepared--a nice fellow who was happy to chat with us when the crowd thinned out a bit and he had time.  They even had some very nice Taylor port to savor after the meal, not always easy to find in American restaurants.  It was a bit noisy when full however, they really don't need to have piped-in music over top of the chatter of happy diners.  We'd certainly dine here again, it's expensive but everyone should treat themselves to a meal like this every now and then.",

Although we've had that done before it's always a nice touch.   The sides were great, but I do wish they had creamed corn, nonetheless it was yum.  Lastly, we each had a dessert.

The burger very salty, overcooked dry, the bun dry only smothered the burger, Smash Burgers or 5 Guys tastes and presents much better. Ending with the Cheesecake, not creamy, nor flavorful. Others at the table had the same feelings with their burgers. The left overs will be donated. Very over rated!",

I agree with most people here that the bread basket was intricate and diverse. There was no piece left unturned at our table. We all got a variety of side dishes that included lobster Mac and Cheese (which, disappointedly, was the worst tasting dish of the night) asparagus, mashed potatoes and spinach. Everything tasted like it came off a cooking show. Finally, my entree. The ribeye. It was glorious. Angels with harps played as I took every bite. Moist, juicy, tender and cooked perfectly medium rare. The service was a little much. Too in your face if you know what I mean. But they meant well and were overall a very nice staff.

We were seated with no menus and had to ask for it ourselves after sitting there for a bit and we were all starving. Everything took awhile to come out and all three of our steaks were bloody when we had ordered medium. Oh well, we were too hungry to send it back to the kitchen and the guy also gave us an annoyed look so we just ate what we could. Since the steaks don't come with a side, I decided to order the $25 truffle mac and cheese. It was overly cheesy and very heavy with minimal truffle flavor. The only thing I really enjoyed was the gigantic King crab legs and Seared Foie Gras on the Belgium waffle. My American Wagyu Steak was also pretty tender, just wish it wasn't undercooked so I could've actually enjoyed it.",

Kobe meatball is a must try and large enough to share between two people. Oysters were nice; we had mapleques.

After dinner we ordered dessert. It's our tradition to exchange gifts during dessert.  We've done that for the last 36 years.  After 15 minutes I asked the server if she forgot our dessert order.  She said she would check on it. I reminded her that we had only another 30 minutes before we had to go and also to bring the check .  She immediately brought the check and said that dessert was on its way.  It never came after another 30 minutes and the server never checked back.  We signed our bill and rushed out.  Later we contacted  brian  mogeon who is the general manager.  He basically said come back sometime and I'll get you dessert!   Said sorry but you should have said something before you paid your bill!  We would have if someone was available!   Bottom line, if you are looking for average food,high prices and poor service,  this is your place!",

The Food was amazing, every course, all the appetizers and especially the wine. Our server (James) went 200% above and beyond anyone could expect or hope for. He was absolutely amazing from the minute we walked in until the minute we left. He walked us through every step of the meal and helped us with our wine pairing like no one has ever before. His passion for his job made it an experience, not just a meal, and an unbelievable one we'll never forget at that! Definitely recommended with no hesitation!",

Overall would recommend and return again.",

Better than Smith & Wollensky, Morton's, The Palm, and the Prime at Bellagio. And the duck fat french fries are a must! Service was good, and the side were more than ample. Thumbs up!!And I'm a NY Meat district snob!",

There was more then two of us, and I wouldn't be alarmed to spend that for a wonderful experience. I wasn't going to review them but it still is bothering me 1 month later. I strongly recommend somewhere else....",

The service is always on point here but this visit was a bit more special! It was super busy due to March Madness. We check in for our 8 pm reservation!  Enter our server, Rebecca! She quickly greets us and takes our drink orders. We see her visiting all her tables and making sure everyone is enjoying their dinners... ya know, normal server stuff.  There is a party of 3 seated next to our booth. An older couple with a gentleman in a wheel chair. He looks like maybe he is the father of one of them (maybe in his 90's) I see Rebecca greet them as she did with us.  She comes back over with our drinks and takes our order. She is pleasant and explains everything and even asked us if we were on a time constraint so she she could plan the order of dinner.  We notice that our older customers orders are brought out. Then we see this! Rebecca having casual conversation as she would with most of her tables then she starts prepping the older mans food, cutting his food into small pieces so it is easy for him to eat it. Seriously, human kindness at its best! Rebecca came over to our table to give us the progress of dinner. My husband mentioned to her how he noticed what she did and how sweet she was to do that. She was so embarrassed that we had noticed! She said she saw him struggling to cut up his dinner so she just did it! Seriously... she makes no more for doing what she did. She isn't required to do this for her job!  She was being a kind human being! Kudos to you Rebecca!!! O.H. Is lucky to have you there  Oh and the yelp stuff! Highly recommend the seafood tower! Oh man it's good! Lollipop ribeye for the share! All the sides are excellent!  Service: 1000000000000000  stars Prices: you get what you paid for!   Can't wait for another diamond celebration next year but we will be back before that I am sure!",

After waiting almost 45 minutes for it to arrive, it was presented on a large platter cut up into 1/2\" x 2\" strips. Although it was cooked to the correct temperature, the cut of meat was inferior. One would expect rib eye to have considerable marbling but not ribbons of fat and gristle which comprised more than 20 percent of the serving. Furthermore, this $125 steak provided no more than 14 to 16 ounces of actual meat -- very, very disappointing.  The oysters-in-the-half-shell starter was very good.",

    "text": "This is absolute five-star dining at its best! We came with a very large group on. Saturday night. We were seated in a private room with a wonderful ambiance. Just the right amount of light to make you relax. We started sharing the Applewood Smoked Bacon and Kobe Beef Meatball. They were both everything I could have expected and much more. The flavors were so amazing I didn't even try the sauces served with them. Next I had the French Onion Soup. Many others had the very impressive Shrimp Cocktail. The soup was hands down the best French Onion Soup I've ever had. The broth flavor had a depth and richness I have never experienced. There was nothing small about these shrimp! Like the soup they were a meal alone. Each shrimp was the size of my entire hand and over an inch in diameter. It came highly recommended by the wait staff and did not disappoint! The Filet Mignon, Mashed Potatoes and Roasted Mushrooms was the popular choice in the group after rave recommended by the staff. The Filet was thick, moist, tender and seasoned perfectly. No need for any of their specialty sauces or horseradish. The roast mushrooms I could have eaten for days! The Jidori Chicken also got rave reviews among friends. The Brussel Sprouts in particular were amazing! The depth of flavors in the sauce was complex and so delicious!   By dessert I'm not sure how we had room for another bite! We all shared the Creme Brulee, Big Fat Chocolate Cake and Cheesecake. Like everything else we had been served we were not to be disappointed! Everything we had was delicious and exceeded all expectations. The Cheesecake was thick, creamy and rich complimented by delicious fresh berries. The Creme Brulee was perfection!  A creamy, smooth delicate custard had a perfect sugary crust topped with fresh, juicy berries and creamy chantilly! My personal favorite was the Big Fat Chocolate Cake. This is a chocolate lovers dream! This cake will feed a few people! It is a rich, dense chocolate cake layered with a light, rich chocolate mousse! This cake was dreamy! I highly recommend it.  Staff was outstanding. They kept cocktails, wine and other beverages coming with minimal wait. Water glasses stayed full. Plates were cleared efficiently. Staff made recommendations on everything from cocktails, wines and menu selections. They were always perfect.   Thank you for an amazing evening.",

The mac and cheese should be named cheese with a little macaroni. It was a nice side. The reason for only 3 stars was my steak. It was cooked correctly, but came out cold. I couldn't understand how. It was seasoned well.  Excellent cut of meat. A little salty but that's how they do it, that was ok. However for the price, I would expect better. My wife had the salmon too. She was underwhelmed.

    "text": "What a disappointment!   Came here with my mother for a steak dinner at 10:00pm. We waited about eleven minutes for our server to even address us in an empty restaurant - fine. Another server was kind enough to bring us menus after six or so minutes of being seated, and finally prompted our server to address us. I understand maybe a Thursday night might cause some delay. There was an eight-stack right next to us, after all.   Our server finally arrived without an apology. We ordered a surf and turf, sauteed spinach, and a wedge salad to start.  Wedge salad was alright. No complaints here.  The food was absolutely atrocious. The steak, which we requested medium, was raw. My mother was rather upset (quite embarrassingly, actually, but with what she was paying for this you can't quite blame her). Shrimp was nearly inedible. Nothing had flavor. The only one to check on us was the busser (who was lovely! attentive and just great). My mom had to be one of \"those people\" to wave over for a manager to come.   And then came the arguing! Oh man, that was a rough. I was pissed, mom was pissed, and the manager was so defensive and in disbelief that the food was bad, us hangry ladies had even more heightened emotions. She knocked off the bill because the food was inedible - but she continued to argue with my mother, telling her that's the way they prepare medium steak (raw?), and that we didn't weight for our menus or waters at all. My mother had to tell her to go away because she wanted to continue arguing.  Before we left, our server quipped, \"Sorry you hated my service!\"   Me too, buddy. Ugh. What a bunch of arrogance all around. If you're paying upwards of $100 for a meal, you should be treated like you matter at least somewhat...  And I'm sure that peach of a manager plans to come on here, too. That's fine. Just please don't argue with hungry customers because your chefs screwed up on bad, substandard meat.  Two stars for your busser!",

    "text": "According to my June 6, 2017 experiences....  We really thought we were going to get the best steak out there (high reviews with Yelp), when we went landed at the Old Homestead Steakhouse. Steaks are special, we only get them on special occasions: birthdays, dates with my husband......possibly once a month; anyway you pay for the best and expect the best.   Ok, the food. The bread: mini loaves of different types of bread: pretzel, bacon, and some other flavors. It was pretty for the eyes, but when it came down the the truth they weren't extraordinary, just bread... the butter was great.   We started with a salad: \"Everything in the Kitchen Sink\" ($30) ...sounds gross, but it had some real ingredients in it, to be qualify as a salad I'd be interested in: tomatoes, avocados, olives, salami (strips), bacon (pieces, not chunks, tasted at the end), blue cheese, shrimp,  and it was not an iceberg lettuce based type of salad. Bravo, the salad was beautifully tossed, and the ingredients were paired off well, nothing too over powering. It was an average salad.   The main course: the \"Ribeye\" (16 oz. @ $50+) this is where my review will fall extremely sad.  You imagine: juicy fat marbling, thick and tender to every cut. Well it's all in your imagination here at the, \"Old Homestead Steakhouse\", because maybe the head chief went home early, sick, on an emergency note......the dinner crowd was gone, we were there after 9pm. When the \"Ribeye\"came out it was a center piece on the platter, ok, I thought, \"this is going to be delicious\". What happened when I cut into it? Where was the \"Ribeye\"???????? It was more like a BRISKET!!!! It was pathetic. Did they not think we would know? Of course I did not want to delay my dining experience with my colleagues by complaining and having them cook another steak, so I chewed on. : - ( ** If I had knew to save the butter, it could have helped.   Good luck to you, if you end up here.",

    "text": "Terrible, inedible and the cause of food poisoning which was terribly handled by the casino. After admitting to serving bad meat management assigned a mindless outside claims administration company to me. They barraged me with phone calls without any regard to the fact I made clear I did not intend to bring a claim. They also ignored my clearly messaged schedule and called me over and over. Eventually after I took the time to speak with them an imbecile denied my \"claim\" on the spot on the basis that I had no blood tests.   Let's now focus on the experience. The wait was long, and the hostess clueless or overwhelmed. The martini I had was one shot of watered down liquor. I asked for it to be dirty and they satisfied my request by putting a single olive in the drink. The steak I ordered was minuscule and I figured out why after my first bite. It was all fat and grizzle which must have shrunk during cooking. It tasted like burnt grease and the meat was raw red, not medium as I had specified. The cream spinach was watery and tasteless. As I recall, I had much better in the frozen dinner meals I ate in college. The potatoes were doused in an overly rich cream that lacked taste. I was forced to run to the bathroom because I was sick, and during that time the fatty grizzle was removed from the table. One picture of that foul meat may have saved those who ignore this report from entering this swill pit. While the waiter argued with me, the manager clearly stated he examined my steak \"and they really screwed up\".   As a local I am aware of the dozens of great steak houses in Las Vegas and j can't understand why this one is still in business.",

He skipped me for the appetizer,  one of friends during the entree and another one of my firends during dessert. They also forgot to bring out one of the sides dishes we had ordered.   Now for the positive:  Bread basket was very tasty, try the bacon cheese roll, it was FANTASTIC  The Lobster Bisque was the best I've ever had.   The Basil salad was okay but nothing to rave about.   The seafood platter was wonderful and very filling.  The Gotham Rib was cooked perfectly and the truffle butter gave the steak that extra flavor to kick it up.  The truffle mac and cheese and mash were very tasty as well.   The dessert was very yummy but the banana bread pudding was my fav.   Overall the food was very yummy. The portions were a good size and I would def recommend if anyone asks.   The place only opened a little over a month and I assume the service will get better with time. They were very busy and maybe it was just an oversite and they will learn from their mistakes.",

At first, I thought it was just poor knife skills, but now I am not sure if it was a ribeye at all. No marbling of fat at all, dry meat and gritty in texture. I did, unfortunately, get a marbling of gristle. I had to spit out pieces I could not chew. I ordered rare, but got medium. After over a hundred years in business, you don't know what rare is? I left more than half of my 24 ounce on the plate and when asked if I wanted to take it to go, I replied no. He asked again to make sure if I wanted it in the garbage and I replied yes.

Service is fantastic, our server was great.   - Seafood Tower: though pricey, I think it's actually a pretty good deal compared with the rest of the seafood on the menu. Presentation was great. All very fresh and very tasty. My personal favorite was the king crab legs.   - Thick Cut Applewood-Smoked Bacon: would've never ordered this on my own, but with that said - soo delicious. Big plate of bite-sized thick cut bacon.   - Ribeye 'Gotham': don't usually see ribeyes on the bone. This came out a little more rare than we asked for, but it was still delicious (and I'm usually not a huge steak fan).   - Sides: Mac and four cheese (great), Brussels sprouts (meh, have had better), roasted mushrooms (great), and gnocchi with truffle butter (pretty good).  - Duck fat fries: flavor was pretty light, hint of duck fat.   - Desserts: bread pudding (amazing! almost like a banana foster, sitting in syrup), cast iron cookie (like a pizookie, ice cream on fresh baked cookie, it was okay), creme brulee (good, standard/no spin).",

When you ask for a medium steak, you will get a medium steak, very knowledgeable and friendly staff.  We had for appetizers a delicious Rockefeller oysters wich they were amazing!!! And as well the fried calamari.   The \"Gotham Rib\" Steak on the bone, Rib eye, it was soooo tender and tasty! It was a huge piece of steak and just so delicious.

This Las Vegas location is based off the original restaurant in Manhattan, both of which feature a luxurious feel with the dark woods and rich burgundy tones. My husband and I recently stopped in on a whim, and were extremely lucky that they had availability on the spot. It looked very busy, so we were expecting to be turned away. This was the first of many positives during our meal.  Give me the right bread, and I will carb the heck out on the entire bread basket. Let me just say, this was the right stuff. They serve a variety including pumpernickel, pretzel bread, baguette, and more. My husband and I spilt one of every variety and I was in carb heaven.   We wanted to start off by sharing a wedge salad, and were pleasantly surprised to find that it had already been spilt for us before being brought to the table. Many times, this is not the case with a wedge due to the presentation factor. However, our salads still looked beautiful as two little spilt wedges and they tasted even better.  Back to that beef. My husband and I each ordered the 8 oz. filet and both came out juicy and cooked to perfection. We chose the cheddar potato gratin for our side and were both confident we made the right selection after trying the first bite. It was ooey gooey cheesy goodness!  I'd love to go back in the future and maybe save room for one of their fabulous looking desserts by cutting out some of the bread beforehand. Well, maybe...",

It allowed me to fully relax in a way I was needing after the crowds and constant noise of Vegas. She was the type of bartender every fine restaurant or gastropub should look for. The steak was a little undercooked for my liking and she personally had them fix it. It was then one of the best filet's I have ever had. I am a healthy eater and I saw a lot of options on their menu that I would have enjoyed. I will be back. I wrote this on TripAdvisor too. This is the one restaurant in Caesars I would recommend.",

We also weren't disappointed to add the Mac and Four Cheese and the Truffle Gnocchi either. And yes we realize we had a table covered in carbs. Yet another decision we showed no remorse for.

    "text": "Old Homestead is a place we look forward to eating at every year when we're in town for work, a dining tradition we've had as a large group for over the past 6 years. I have no idea what has happened to their service, but as a restaurant that used to take such care for their customers (especially those with food allergies), the Old Homestead of today is nothing like it once was. I specifically mentioned my allergies to our server upon ordering (soy and nuts). He wrote them down, and I felt safe. After a lengthy dinner and delays in our orders coming out, likely due to the restaurant's busy nature tonight, I started eating my ordered potato gnocchi. About half of the way through, I notice that the bottom of the dish is covered in edamame. I flag our server down to confirm. He had to \"check with Chef\" and then disappeared. A man I can only assume was the manager appeared a few minutes later to confirm that yes, this was edamame - soy beans for the unfamiliar. Clearly, our serving and the chef of this renown steakhouse do not know what edamame in fact is. It also was no where in the item description on the menu. The manager asked if I wanted to \"file a report\" or that he could \"call security\" to escort me somewhere - neither of which help someone in the middle of an allergic reaction. Old Homestead should be ashamed. A chef who hopefully attended culinary school should be ashamed. Allergy and non-allergy customer alike, beware. If I could give zero stars, trust that I would.",

My wife ordered a filet medium well. The first time it came out the steak was well done with no pink. The second time it came out the waiter asked her to cut into the steak and it was still WELL DONE and dry. She ended up dipping the steak into her mash potatoes because the steak was so dry and she could barley swallow.  If you are looking for a great steak with exceptional flavor and juiciness i would not recommend Homestead. She did complain to the waiter but they only offered desert. The service was excellent, the staff was very attentive.",

Frank decides he needs some flesh and decides this is the place based on the menu and meat selections. I'm not worried about $90 piece of meat, however please don't burn the shit out of it. I ordered a ribeye steak and asked medium well ( lightly pink inside) and I got a burnt hunk of meat that was not pink inside or juices or any resemblance of a prefect piece of dry aged meat. The thing was black, crunchy and like a hockey puck. Needless to say I was very disappointed and made my complaint known.  The waiter was notified and our bill was a wash since I didn't feel like waiting 30 minutes for another piece of meat to be cooked.  Sad that a top notched steakhouse could not properly cook a steak. That's my story and I'm sticking to it.",

We were a few minutes late due to a misestimation of Las Vegas traffic but were received promptly without comment at the reception.  We were immediately taken to our tables and provided drink menus.  After some deliberation and some helpful advice from the sommelier, we decided on a half bottle of wine (Merry Edwards Pinot '12).  We were asked if we had a show time to make, and our server promised to get us out in time Seinfeld later that evening.    We each ordered a filet, and shared a serving of asparagus as our side.  The meat was fantastic - it was charred on the outside, and perfectly pink on the inside.  Please note (and they warn you of this) that the meat is intentionally charred on the outside to preserve the juices.  Each of the filets was seasoned perfectly with no need for extra salt or pepper.  The asparagus was delightful - perfectly cooked to be appropriately crisp and seasoned.    Following the steak, we shared an order of Creme Brulee which was fine. Everything from the texture to the caramelized crust was executed well, but the taste was just average.   What really gives this restaurant 5 stars was the superior service we were afforded. Our wait staff, led by Will, was perfectly attentive.  Whether Will, the sommelier, or the flurry of other staff we always felt perfectly well attended.",

Our server, Kevin was beyond amazing. Extremely attentive, caring and sweet. We started out with a thick cut bacon appetizer then had the lobster bisque. Both were very flavorful. Portion wise was a little big so I definitely recommend sharing appetizers. My husband and I both had the filet mignon which was excellent. Perfectly cooked. The meat spoke for itself. Clean and tender. We also decided to have dessert. I had the creme brule and my husband had the cheesecake. Both were excellent but we didn't finish them since at this point we were beyond full.

    "text": "CAESARS PALACE SWEEPSTAKES WINNER ADVENTURE #7: LAST COMPED DINNER  When I won the \"I Am Caesars\" Indulgence Sweepstakes for Caesars Palace 50th Anniversary one of the perks I would get is $600 dining credit. For months I had this premonition of how to exploit the dining credit. I would apply half of the dining credit at Restaurant Guy Savoy. The rest of the balance I would use it at another restaurant and room service. After months of deliberation I decided not to eat at Restaurant Guy Savoy or have room service to apply my dining credit. That other restaurant I decided to use my dining credit was Old Homestead Steakhouse because I wanted to use my dinner credit for one night at a steakhouse.   On my last night at Caesars Palace I ate here for dinner. I started my trip with $600 dining credit. The first two nights I used less than $400. I asked the person who was coordinating my trip if the balance from the last two dinners could be applied for this one last dinner. She said yes. On my last night I had $237 to comp for my final dinner. I was going to go out on style. Of course I was going to order steak. My favorite type of steak is bone-in. The bone in the steak adds a natural flavor to the steak. I thought about ordering the bone-in filet mignon. However I asked my server what bone-in steaks he would recommend. He stated either the porterhouse or rib eye, which he highly suggested. So I decided the ribeye. The only dilemma I had was if I was going to order the \"Gotham\", which is a 24 oz. steak for one person, or the \"Lollipop\", which is a 38 oz. steak for two people. However I was going to order the \"Lollipop\" for myself. The cost difference between the two cuts of bone-in rib eye steak was $43 as the \"Lollipop\" costs $125 and the \"Gotham\" costs $82. I decided to get the \"Gotham\" as it was less expensive of the two steaks. However by ordering the \"Gotham\" I can order more items such a side dish and a cocktail. For this last night I thought about getting wine with my steak. When I looked at the cocktail menu one item stood out. In honor of me winning the Caesars Palace \"I Am Caesars\" Sweepstakes I ordered the Roman 75 mainly because the name Roman. Since I was eating at Caesars Palace it made sense to order caesars salad. In addition I ordered lobster mac and cheese and Atlantic salmon.   I didn't order any appetizers but ate the warm bread that this restaurant serves. I have a weakness for warm, crusty bread and soft butter. The bread was really good. However I had to pace myself with the bread because of the rib steak and the lobster mac and cheese. The \"Gotham\" arrived medium rare. I always order my steak medium rare. A major pet peeve of mine is when customers order their steak well done especially on high-priced steaks. Even though I wasn't going to pay for the steak I wasn't going to order an $82 well done steak. The \"Gotham\" wasn't the best steak I've ever had but it was flavorful. There's something unique about a bone-in steak as the combination of bone, fat, and meat enhances the steak's flavor. Since the steak cost $82 I took my time eating the steak - as if I was a Caesar. I like the Roman 75 cocktail as it had a lemonade, liquor taste that made the cocktail refreshing. The Atlantic salmon was flaky yet moist. The item that was disappointing was the lobster mac and cheese, which is the main reason I didn't rate this place five stars. There were little chunks of lobster. The only lobster flavor you can taste is the bisque or broth in the mac and cheese.   At the end I had $237 to exhaust my dining credit. The final bill was $218 without taxes meaning I left $19 on the table. When I was ordering I didn't really keep count of how much the final bill would be. I thought maybe I should have ordered another side dish such as duck fat fries, gnocchi with truffle butter, or seared foie gras. Or better yet not ordering the lobster mac and cheese, which I would have saved $26. Add the $19 I would have $45 left meaning I should've ordered the \"Lollipop\". I learned a lesson never sacrifice a main dish for a side dish. I could've ordered desserts but to be honest I was full due to the lobster mac and cheese.   During my free 3-night stay at Caesars Palace I had 3 comped dinner: Rao's, Mesa Grill, and Old Homestead Steakhouse. Each restaurant had their own characteristics, but I was grateful that I never paid one cent while I dined at Caesars Palace - a True hallmark of living like a Caesar. Would I eat at Old Homestead Steakhouse again? Given the prices and that I had a comped dinner I would eat here again if I win big at the slots or craps. If I do come back here again due to my large gambling winnings I wouldn't hesitate to order the \"Lollipop\" along with the thick-cut slices of bacon from the menu.",

Kevin our waiter was absolutely attentive to our every need and made sure the food and drinks were all flowing in perfect timing. I think one of my favorite elements of our dinner is we didn't feel rushed. So many restaurants you eat at feel like they are moving the courses forward so fast that you are rushing out the door. This felt for us very european in our experience of the pace of dinner. We were all chatting and hanging out as the courses came out and completely lost track of time. Highly recommend going and ask for Kevin to be your waiter if he is working.",

Everything was five star excellence, the service, the attentiveness of the services, the foods, the cocktails which were mixed to near perfection, everything! I have never had a steak, a Ribeye, has tender and flavourful as the one I had that night. The ambiance was casual in clothing yet clearly upscale and sophisticated in personality and attitude. Overall, I would visit Old Homestead Steakhouse again. Highly recommended!",

I paid good money and ended up with crap. I work for High net worth Clients. Trust me when I say this place is worst than Chris Ruth Steak House. At this I wouldn't let my dog eat here.Literally this place is hopeless. Taco Bell is more predictable then this pig farm.Okay for even worst news, I get home and the crab legs I bought and ask to be put in a doggy bag had been left out of my Doggy bag. I paid a premium for someone is eating them. I spoke to the manager and he looked at me and I felt as if I were talking into the wind. Yes.... That bad. In short, If you are  Looking for over priced disappointment in food that leaves you feeling like you were taken and want to complain and know it will fall on deaf ears, you have arrived this is the mother of all disappointments.

The bone in filet was perfectly prepared and had just the right amount of seasoning allowing the flavor of the meat to come through.  Our server was Nigel he was informative, friendly, and made great suggestions.  The ODB martini was the perfect amount  of dirty and the old fashion had a good autumn flavor. The manager came by and and thanked us for coming which was a great finishing touch. Overall a very nice dinner out in Vegas.",

This is a New York style steakhouse with a dark and romantic ambiance, formal waiters who aim to please, and staff who are constantly filling your water and bringing you things like fresh bread and butter.   They have an extensive wine list, with many choices by the glass and bottle.   The food is excellent, with many choices for appetizers, including a delicious French onion soup.  But the steaks are what will keep you coming back - including multiple filet mignon options - with all the sauces you could want...they even have a flight of steak sauces you can try which were all outstanding (hint, try the peppercorn or freshly made horseradish sauce...or both!).   They also have seafood - try the oysters as they have both east coast and west coast oysters to choose from - or the breast of chicken. All were delicious. We couldn't even try dessert as we were stuffed!  Great staff. Great food. Great experience.",

We had viewed the menu before sitting down and knew it was not going to be cheap which is fine as long as the food is equal to the price. My husband had 2 beers I had a glass of wine (so so) we each had a steak and split 2 sides. The bill came to roughly $300. We might be spoiled coming from the Midwest but the steak had no flavor at all and was pretty tough! One side we barely touched as it was just bad and the potatoes were average. Our server was nice and professional so he gets 4 stars!  1 star for ambiance, very loud and not a place for a quiet dinner with your spouse or a couple friends. It's Vegas so groups think they need to be loud and obnoxious!  p.s. just because something looks good on a plate in a picture, doesn't mean it tastes good.",

For dinner my husband had the burger & I had the wedge salad & a side of truffle gnocchi. We both enjoyed everything.   With a couple beers & 1 glass champagne and our food it pretty much took the whole $200 credit. We didn't even have two entrees. I would probably go back for an appetizer again but I wouldn't pay that much for a dinner.",

The beef carpaccio is not to be missed. If you've ever wanted to try it and haven't- do yourself a favor and order it.  AMAZING!!  Filet mignon was perfect.

With her charismatic personality and knowledge of the menu  made it easy for us to dine with out feeling overwhelmed. She gave us the VIP treatment which I am sure she does with every one of her guest. We started with the seafood tower, it was delicious. Kim suggested we try our oysters with all of the sauces and told us that was the best way to have them, and boy was she right yum!!! The manager Toshi came and greeted us, and surprised us with Champagne in honor of our anniversary. I thought that was very kind and loved the attention to detail on how he knew it was a special occasion for us. My husband had the Dover sol and I had the filet which was cooked to perfection. We also had the Mac n cheese, mashed potatoes and asparagus. The food tasted as good as it looked, delicious.  We finished the night with a array of desserts and I was wishing I had two stomachs to fit all in but unfortunately that was not case. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants quality food, exceptional service and a intimate dining experience. Best steak house in Vegas !! So far my favorite place!!! Thank you to all of the staff at Old Homestead for making our anniversary dinner special.",

First let me say that if you are like me, you've passed this place on the way to Mesa(Bobby Flay), Nobu or the Total Rewards desk, and this is a mistake!  When the 8 of us entered the place we did not have our own room and we are such snobs.  So we sat down not expecting much and boy were we in for a surprise.  Our service team of real professionals were kind, engaging and knowledgeable about the menu, the ingredients and the wine.  This place is know for its beef, so if you are not willing to even taste the small amounts you are offered by your table mates you should leave right away because you will be missing out in the thing that makes place a A#1 experience.  And this is from me... a person who eats beef less than 12 Times a year.  So,   We ordered a large bottle of Malbec I think from Argentina and it was excellent.  The bread basket was overflowing but I only tried the  bacon cheddar rolls which were delicious and the fresh butter was an added plus.  We ordered the following appetizers: Oysters Rockefeller, crab cakes, bone marrow and fried calamari. Everything was beautifully prepared fresh and flavorful.  Then we got to the serious eating. Our entrees included Wagyu beef, filet mignon, salmon, scallops and New York steak.  We loved it all!!. I tried the wagyu beef which really did \"melt in your mouth\", and the scallops were plump and sweet. The side dishes are large and should be shared.   Finally the desserts. I was too full to really enjoy it.  We shared the cookie with the ice cream and the bread pudding. I loved the former and I think I was too full to fairly judge the later.  Anyway, we have shared meals at  celebrity chef restaurants,but one has all the others beat!",

    "text": "I had high expectations for this place as an X New Yorker I know the Old Homestead growing up and was expecting something terrific and it is not that.  So, one thing I would expect from a good steakhouse is a good steak. Well, it was OK but not great. Had the 14oz Sirloin (that is a New York term as most pedestrians know it as a New York strip) and one of the issue I had is that it was probably more like 10oz or 12oz at most as too thin and hardly had an aged or prime texture. There is that aspect of the place. Oh, and also my friend had the dried up 2.5lb lobster for $75!. Now, one I didn't expect was an amazing app which was a great crab cake and a quite decent wedge salad (I asked for it chopped and our rude waiter seemed to forget that). Now, the service. The waiter dropped a glass right near my friends open flip flops and did the idiot apologize NOOOOOOOO. So, let me get more into this guy, He shows up at the beginning of the meal to take the order over selling, hardly shows up the rest of the meal. He does not have the salad chopped. I had to ask the bus person to send somebody over to get me another less than ordinary martini and he only then shows up to drop a glass, cut my friends foot  and not apologize. Now, yes the good manager tried to make amends but a meal ruined.  Next time I go to this place will be the one in New York, then again there are other great steakhouses in that town so I will pass.",

    "text": "East coast meets west coast at this Las Vegas gem! Old Homestead's menu is overflowing with American favorites that one would expect to see in an NYC steakhouse. From the famous cuts of meat, wine cellar housing 15,000 bottles, and delectable deserts, this urban dining room and bar will not disappoint.  Our table started with the ahi tuna tartare ($25) served with a fluffy avocado mousse and truffle vinaigrette. I'm a sucker for anything truffle, and though generally not a tuna fan, I found myself literally obsessed with this appetizer. The colossal shrimp cocktail ($29) was truly colossal and the \"atomic\" horseradish had a nice kick. The bone-in 34 oz. Porterhouse for two ($125) easily fed three hungry adults and was outstanding. My favorite part, the potato gnocchi ($42) seemed overpriced, but the shaved black truffles were so delicious, it was certainly worth it.   The service was stellar and we greatly appreciated the helpful menu suggestions from our server. Check out their happy hour from 10pm-11pm and treat yourself to one of the best burgers in the city, per Thrillist!",

I have been going to the Old Homestead since I was 16 in New York (9th street, meat packing district) and it is one of my favorite places anywhere.  I found the one in Caesers as I was walking through on time and made this a regular spot.  First, almost always seating at the bar, decent wine selection, a bit overpriced but not too much so.  I almost always get some kind of whiskey / bourbon drink.  They have a great bread basket that comes out, quick tip, before they bring it out just ask them to bring the bacon biscuits and that's it.  They will bring 3-4 out in lieu of the other types of bread (sourdough and pretzel), fantastic.  I almost always just get the 8oz filet, medium rare and duck fat fries.  Perfect easy meal.  I have tried the Crispy calamari, slab bacon, creamed spinach, garlic mash and all of those are absolutely top notch.  Prices are what you would expect at a USDA prime steakhouse and well worth it.    If you are in Vegas, want a great steak, go here, you won't be sorry.",

She likes a smaller steak medium and I like a larger steak medium rare. Her's came out medium rare and mine came medium.  I attempted to eat it, however it was SO dry and tasteless. I asked the waitress for one cooked properly, confirming with her medium rare. She took it back and brought me another one that was just slightly less than medium, definitely not medium rare. It had no juices and was as though they had squeezed all the juices out, totally tasteless and dry. I finally asked for some sauces to add some moisture to it. After suffering through about half, I gave up.   I could have had a better steak at Sizzler and not cost over $200.  If you are looking for a nice restaurant for a special occasion, this is NOT it.

The mushrooms were delish. The cocktails were perfect. The bill was exorbitant. Yadda yadda yadda. That can be said for just about any steakhouse on the Strip (and I've been to several).  What sets the Old Homestead Steakhouse apart and will make us repeat diners is the wonderful service we received that made our evening.  We stopped by here after being told there was an hour-and-a-half long wait at Mesa Grill. The hostess remembered us from the night before (we had tried to stop for a nightcap the previous night, but were told by the assistant manager that they were closed). She said there were cancellations and she could seat us immediately. Nice. We were shown to a table, brought bread and water right away, and told that our server would be Kevin.   Kevin turned out to be one of those industry pros, he'd been a server with the Caesar's restaurant for 30-some years. We took to him immediately as he matched our mood and temperament, and was happy to chat with us and give us the time and interaction we were looking for, even though he had at least two other large parties he was taking care of. The smallest of gestures caught his eye. He anticipated our needs. He was there with a hot finger towels after I was done gnawing on the bone of our NY steak.   A quick note on the steaks - they had some interesting bone-in cuts you don't usually find at other steakhouses. The bone-in filet is on my bucket list.  The assistant manager came by at one point to apologize again for having to turn us away last night and thank us for coming back and giving the restaurant another change.   We had to commend Kevin to the manager, Perry, who was very gracious and gave us his number for future reservations. Kevin said he'd make sure we got a better table next time too, although I didn't think there was anything wrong with the table we had. We didn't have dessert, as nothing in particular appealed to me and dinner was quite satisfying already. So we finished with port and scotch instead and I had the hankering for a bit of chocolate to go with my scotch. Kevin came to the rescue again, bringing me some dark chocolate curls that hit the spot.   The Old Homestead treated us like regulars even though it was only our first time there. I think there is something to be said for a steakhouse or any restaurant that can make you feel that way on a first visit :)",

The good was scrumptious, perfectly cooked, and just beautiful to look at. We had steak of course. Hubby had the shrimp cocktail which had the biggest shrimp we ever saw...no lie! I really really wanted dessert but was stuffed.  The staff was pleasant and very knowledgeable! They were patient as we decided what to eat. I would recommend this place to everyone. We will try the Atlantic City location that's closer to home.",

The staff is friendly, knowledgeable and courteous and it really enhances the experience! They serve high quality dry aged beef and although it's expensive the portions are generous and the overall experience is totally worth the money. I love the seafood in this restaurant too! The shrimp scampi is so impressive, the biggest shrimp you will see anywhere, and the crab legs are outstanding! Try the potato gnocchi with truffle butter and the bacon creamed spinach for sides. Also another great thing about this restaurant is the location... if you are seeing a show at the Colosseum it is steps away, super convenient for dining before or after. Living in Las Vegas, we don't go down to eat on the strip often, but when we do Old Homestead is always on the top of our list.",

We had the seared foie gras, bone-in filet mignon, broiled live Maine lobster, sauteed spinach, creamed corn, mac and cheese, and mushrooms. Everything was greaaat. Not a bad thing to say about any of it! I definitely recommend starting off with the seared foie gras on toast and jam.",

    "text": "PROS: The food is absolutely fantastic. I did not have one bad dish and everything was cooked and presented in perfection. The caviar was nice and salty and it came on an ice block  with many different garnishes and toast. The oysters weren't great but I haven't met an oyster I didn't like. The shrimp were gigantic and the sauces were out of this world. The lobster was sinful. You can tell they get their seafood from a reputable place. My lamb was the star of the show. I have never had a rack so juicy, I wanted to save it so I doggy bagged it and it was delicious even cold. I was speechless after the truffle whipped potatoes. TO DIE FOR! The cocktails were delicious, Key lime pie taste just like the name and the espresso martini was a great way to finish off a meal. They were like drinking dessert! I definitely couldn't eat like that often because the food is very rich but it was a special occasion. Our server, Rocky is just darling and he is timely and personable and the sommelier was awesome too. Both were very attentive. The restaurant, in my opinion, is medium sized but I wouldn't say the decor is anything you would fawn over.   CONS: Although I had some hang ups, dining here was definitely worth 5 stars because the food was so good. I did not like how some of the seating is so exposed to the walkway to the patrons in the hotel. We sat in a booth and I felt a little like being under a microscope. I hated having to smell cigarette smoke while I ate as people often come in that area to smoke. It was nauseating. I also didn't like how I wasn't told how much the caviar was going to be. It had market price on it but if it's not part of the seafood tower, then they should explain that to you. It was good but if I had known it was $250, I wouldn't have ordered it because someone else was paying. I did notice that other people got birthday chocolate cake and I never got one and it was said to our waiter and to our hostess it was my birthday. BOO!! I chose this fancy place BECAUSE it was my birthday. I didn't have room for dessert but I would've loved a bite. Two people and our bill was over $700 with no dessert. It's quite expensive to eat here. Granted, it is good but I have paid less at Michelin starred establishments.",

Here's what we ordered:   Colossal Crab Cake - Chunks of endless crab, crab & more crab! DELISH! Did I mention plentiful amount of crabs?!?!!  Lobster Mac & Cheese - YUM! Such a treat and more than enough for 2!  Gotham Ribeye - Husband had this and this is what they were famous for - He loved it and finished the whole thing without hesitation!  Rack of Lamb - This was my dish -  Boy, do they give you A LOT! You get 2 double bone in lamb chops (4 chops altogether) with a whole bunch of other goodies that pair nicely. Sadly, I finished all the meat but left a pinch of meat on each bone. Not gamey at ALL and the taste was remarkable! I really wanted to chew on the bones, but I had no room left!!! Dessert: Banana Bread Pudding on a cask iron - OH BOY! I had a candle on the side for my b-day which made it extra special!   Overall, everything was wonderful and we couldn't have selected a better place for my birthday! Thank you ALL!",

It was not juicy at all. Very dry.  We ordered it medium and sure enough, there was pink in the middle of the steak. It was just dry. Big disappointment for a 67.00 piece of meat. We also got lobster bisque. Very, very tasty . I should have ordered two bowls.   The Caesars salad was watery.  The lettuce was crisp snd the dressing had good flavor but the lettuce must have been wet and did not hold the dressing.  Never again.    Go across the street to Bally's . The steak house BLT is to die for.",

Eaten there several times last year, however, visit to visit, there food and service was very inconsistent.  One time they were excellent, so you go back during the next visit, then a bombshell.  our group had to send back out steaks 3 times back to the kitchen because they couldn't cook to medium rare.  First was returned because it came out well done, second was returned because they came out bloody raw.  After the 3rd return, we had to walk out and look for an another restaurant.  However, I decided to give them an another try and it also was excellent.  Now, my last visit was somewhat like the 2nd visit with one exception.  Food was excellent, however, service was the worst ever.   It took the server 20 minutes to show up to our table after we got our table.  It took another 29 minutes to bring our wines.  It took 3.5 hours to finish our dinner (one of the slowest since this wasn't some French restaurant with 10 course menu).    They could be great, if they can get their acts together.  This could be a management issue that comes from poor training.  I hope they can fix it since I do love their New York restaurant.",

    "text": "Service was excellent. The hosts - 2 male in suits - were very friendly and told us tons about the restaurant.   1. How they raised their beef - it goes through a strict diet in the months before slaughter... (something like they only feed them corn or something like that).   2. The interior deco of the restaurant - it sorta fees like you are dining underneath a bridge. Metals from a deconstructed bridge in NYC was brought here and used for its deco.   3. How much they loved working there and pride themselves on service.   Food wise, I felt that the beef didn't quite measure up to the hosts' high praise (which might have set our expectations too high). Firstly, the marbling wasn't good. The cut was too lean. Secondly, not every part of the meat was cooked evenly... some closer to well-done than medium. Hence, some parts were more dry than others. Thirdly, some parts had too much salt on it. Overall, it was still a decent steak... better than most places... but nowhere close to the ohmi wagyu beef I had at Shinzo, Singapore. The Japanese really know their beef. More that the Americans it seems! Some say they feed their beef only sake and massage them everyday!   However, Old Homestead Steakhouse does make a pretty mean potato tots! Very delicious! Now this was possible one of the best I've had! :) Ironically, we left more impressed by their potatoes than their steak.",

    "text": "WOW, I am amazed to see so many negative reviews! There is nothing \"old\" about Old Homestead. It's a contemporary steakhouse with great energy and flare, slightly different from its NYC counterpart (from what I've heard)..think Meatpacking District meets the strip ;)  Grey goose martinis, Maryland crab cake and 2 lb lobster.  Excellent dinner, end of story. Throw in the bread basket (pumpernickel and bacon cheddar cornbread were the best) and you are totally set.  As a native Marylander, my big rule of thumb is to NEVER order a \"Maryland\" crab cake when outside the mid-atlantic region. However, I was craving it big time, and the waiter assured me it wouldn't disappoint. Definitely a mix of lump and claw meat, and probably a little too much filler, but overall it was delicious.   Live Maine lobster only comes in 2 lb or 4 lb. 2 lb was more than enough (usually 1-1.5lb is plenty), it was huge! Served very simply with some butter on the side.  Very good lobster, plain and simple.   My two co-workers got petite filets, cooked medium, bearnaise sauce on the side. They are pretty snobby NYC food critics when it comes to their steak (veterans of Sparks, Del Frisco's, Smith & Wollensky, etc.), and they both said it was great. Not the best they've ever had, but certainly not worth a two (or even three) star rating!   Eclectic crowd too, i.e. not old white men smoking cigars. Kinda reminds me of Abe & Arthur's in Manhattan.",

I enjoyed it immensely with the clarified butter and lemon halves they provided. Mac and cheese was not overpowered by the truffle and was creamy and rich. My bf enjoyed every bite of his wagyu and added that the mashed potatoes it came with were fluffy and smooth.   Oh and the bread basket comes with quite an assortment, I believe 5 different types.

I sent my steak back for it to be cooked a little more then it came back well done. I guess it's my own fault for asking to have it cooked a little more. The quality of the beef was disappointing. I've had steaks that are well done and it is still tender but this was chewy and under seasoned. The scallops on the other hand were great. Perfectly cooked and seasoned.

It was perfectly cooked. My aunt and partner each got the rib eye while my uncle had the 3 oz Kobe beef. The rib eyes were fabulous and cooked to perfection but the Kobe beef ($90) was melt in your mouth delicious. Literally just fell to pieces.. It was almost like avocado. So soft, juicy and tender. If you can afford to I would definitely recommend trying it! We paired our meal with a $65 red from napa Valley called Fran something or other which was smooth and easy to drink. The four of us just loved everything about the place. Oh and even though I'm not a sweets or dessert person we shared the baked chocolate chip cookie with ice cream... Big enough for 4 people!!

The shrimp are the biggest I've ever seen! I brought clients in for my most recent visit and we were all still talking about our meal the next day. Thank you Old Homestead for a fantastic meal we aren't soon to forget. We will all be back again soon!",

My girlfriend and I were celebrating her birthday and it was incredibly important that we made the most of our 50 hour stay in Vegas for several reasons.  This place not only had some of the best service we experienced at Caesar's Palace, but it also has the largest and most delicious steak I've had on the strip and was a perfect end to a really wonderful day!  Some of the veggies were a little less than perfect so they're just shy of a 5 star review, but so much better than a four star (so I rounded up!)   Recommend the brussels sprouts, the steak for 2 (you get filet and NY Strip, and both are AMAZING).",

The steak was perfect, I order them medium-well so it's not too pink, but not too dry, and it's on point. Bacon (appetizer) had a great taste and is paired well with the sauce which is kind of a tangy one. Mac n cheese was great, if you like truffle sauce, but it's always something I order when I come here.",

We sent that back optimistic that a little more time would bring the steak to medium well but when it came back it was charred on the outside and almost to medium.. At this point the server involved the manager and the manager began throwing comps at us..  We had them completely refire our entrees.  All in all we had a great meal but this restaurant needs to train their employees how to cook steaks to all temperatures..",

Menu is primarily focused around steaks, however they were promoting oysters this month. Order the Kitchen Sink salad which was delicious. Decent size shrimp along with artichoke hearts, grape tomatoes, arugula. Ordered the NY Steak. Honestly, I was very dissatisfied after my first bite. Fat along the entire steak that was inedible. Also Luke warm. The asparagus, broccolini and the mushrooms were delicious. Perhaps I will give this resturant another try but very doubtful with all the steakhouse restaurants in the valley.",

    "text": "Where to begin another high end steak house in Las Vegas is like adding insult to injury. Staying at Caesars Place for a Work conference, and after having some finger food at the corporate event 3 of us decided to head for a real meal just off the Casino at the recently opened Old Homestead of sister fame NYC / AC.  I have dinned in both Atlantic City and New York and both have been exceptional. With so many choices for me here, I was reluctant but excited to get that Steak they have become so accustomed to delivering.   OK checked into the hotel went to the concierge and asked that he make us a reservation for 4 for 8:45PM they tell me 9PM no problem. He will call me if there is an issue, I tip him and off I go to my conferences and social events. 8:45 arrive to the restaurant and no reservation can be found, under no name.  Strike 1.  The girl is apologetic but nothing she can do for me it's simply not there. She says give me a few I'll see what I can do.  Lucky to find a high top bar table round barely big enough for 3 but we put 4 here rather than wait for a dining table that could be 45 minutes or so.  Waiter was good and took our drink orders, and brought some fresh bread with some pretzel sticks in it. Pretty good and enjoyable.   Order of Onion rings were ordered for an appetizer along with two salads. Vine Ripened tomatoes & red onions and INE RIPENED TOMATO AND HOMESTEAD CHOPPED 12TOMATO, ONION, MUSHROOM, PEPPERS, HARICOT VERTS, BLACKOLIVES, CRUMBLED BLUE CHEESE AND BASIL VINAIGRETTE Large portions on the salads easily split able and the onion rings were ok \"$12.00\" but nothing you can't find at a good sports bar.  Salads were very good and by far the best thing all night.  Dinner is served:  New York Strip $54.00 \"Charred Medium Rare\"  No char and although this was one tender cut of meat it had absolutely no flavor whatsoever? Where was the dry rub? Sea salt? simply non descript but certainly not a bad piece of meat just tasteless.  The filet didn't fare much better 10 Oz $48.00 again Medium rare and filet not having much flavor to begin with was also lacking something.  The Rib Eye Gotham Cut on the bone $54.00 22 Oz was the best of the 3 but there was entirely too much bone vs. meat and not a $54.00 cut of steak.  What really was a disaster were the two side dishes $12.00 each Garlic Mashed potatoes were like MUSH. They were flat, tasteless and runny a complete and utter embarrassment.  The Sauteed mushrooms $12.00 were like something found in your backyard that you decided to throw in a pan with some olive oil and saute real quick. Another complete and utter cluster ****.    No Deserts were wanted or tried.  I am trying to objective here but for the price points you simply can't have tasteless steaks regardless of the quality and presentation and the disaster side dishes put this on the not ever again list for me at least not in Vegas.  Del Frisco's and the Palm for that matter 100 yards down on the left in the forum shops are much better dining options.   El Paso for this traveler.",

I check every place on yelp before going there except this one (me and my husband were hungry so we just jumped in here) and had the most terrific meal in our life (and we are pretty picky and have dined in micheline star restaurants all over the world). Steaks are amazing! My jewish husband is a bi fan of bacon (lol) and this place is his holly grail. Wine is fantastic (that's pretty much all us women need when their husbands are having their bacon). Service is good too. We have been in this restaurant for 4 times now and every time when we walk in we have tell each other \"I can't believe this place has 3.5 stars on yelp\".",

    "text": "Our server and waite staff was very attentive and friendly. Never did our party want for anything. Our glasses were never empty and Burke our waitor took initiative in helping us choose our wine.  The food came promptly and starting with the appetizers;  The Meatball with marinara was the best I ever tasted (and I have a Grandmother from Italy.) The fresh horseradish sauce had an incredible taste. Shrimp cocktail was cooked to perfection and the presentation made it almost too stunning to eat. BUT WE ATE WELL  The finest sear and temperatures on our cuts of beef. The Lollipop Rib Eye was juicy and so tender. We had several sauces that enhanced the flavor however the steaks did not need any help they were soft as mousse. I think the red wine demi glaze was my favorite.   On to the sides..... I can not choose which was my favorite!!!  The gnocchi and truffle with its velvety texture and creamy buttery sauce made more than one set of eyes role at the table. I could eat that everyday.  The corn with jicama was infused with so much flavor and the crisp of the jicama added a great balance.  The tater tots and fat boy sauce added comfort to an already perfect meal. The flavors were so impressive and each side complemented the next.  We shared 4 desserts I am not a big chocolate fan but.... I am ruined by their Chocolate chip pizzokie style dessert, no other cookie will do now! The Layered Chocolate Rasberry cake was perfectly moist and the right amount of sweetness. My first time trying Bananas Foster and I can not believe I have been missing out on this decadent dessert. The Key Lime Pie..... I ate it as slowly as possible for I didn't want it to come to an end.  We were able to thank the Sous Chef Ruben Garcia and he was friendly and professional. Worth the money and time. I will go there again and I will recommend to anyone I know who travels to Vegas. Everyone deserves to have a meal this well prepared.",
