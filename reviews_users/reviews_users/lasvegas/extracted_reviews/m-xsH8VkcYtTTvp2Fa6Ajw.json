Tasty stuff drinks and exceptional tacos, a must if you're in Downtown Summerlin abs looking for a spot with good eats. I will make sure to bring my friends and family next time they come into town to visit.",

    "text": "My husband and I ordered a two item combo (taco & chile relleno), guacamole, two margaritas (one mango, one traditional on the rocks). My husband had three margaritas & we split the entree, no other food ordered. We thought it was quite expensive. Our bill with tip was $102. That's without the guacamole which they gave us complimentary due to our wait for drinks, even though we never complained. That was nice. The guacamole portion was very large, but the entree was average size with a small portion of rice & beans. The food was good but nothing \"wowed\" either of us. The taco was our favorite. The guacamole needed salt. The service was not great, but we tried to give them the benefit of the doubt since the restaurant had just opened the day before. We waited a long time for our initial drinks. We sat in the bar and it was pretty full, two or three empty tables. The restaurant is beautiful inside. Exactly what you'd expect from a Mexican place. We came to the conclusion that if we are going out for Mexican we'll go to Juan's Flaming Fajitas on West Tropicana. It's cheaper, the service is great, the atmosphere is decent, & the food is outstanding. Conclusion- been there, checked it out, will go again if a friend wants to meet up there for a drink at their suggestion, but I wouldn't suggest it.",

We had the spicy margarita's and they were amazing, followed by the tortilla soup which is the best I've had in Vegas by far. I had the Mole Pipian and it was really well made and seasoned, the portion was big enough to have left overs for later. My wife had the Tinga Poblano and her dish was superb.

We sat near the water fountain which created a relaxing and inviting atmosphere.  Our server Miguel was awesome, attentive and fun.  We were brought a complimentary glass of champagne and a small bowl of fruit while waiting for our food which by the way, was delivered quickly and perfectly hot (hate cold eggs!).  Neither of us ate the fruit, not sweet, out of season, appeared a bit old --  they should forego it altogether.   Overall a great experience, just a little surprised when we received the bill -- tax and our 20% tip (would have liked to have given more to Miguel to be honest) came to $90.00 total.  We each had one margarita,  one brunch item and we split a brownie dessert.  Seemed a bit overpriced to us but I would definitely go back, the food was delicious, excellent service and atmosphere but would definitely forego the $11.75 margarita and stick with the champagne.",

Tropical trees and a winding staircase make it seem intimate even though it's just one room. The food is excellent and they have a gluten free menu. I usually get the mole chicken, it comes with the rice and beans as usual. I get corn tortilla to sop up the sauce. The margaritas are a nice size and they don't skimp on the tequila. You can get any one of the dozens of tequilas they have on the menu. I tried the queso fun dido but I didn't like it. They told me it was their own spin, meaning people must order it then complain. The fun of fun dido is wrapping The gooey cheese around a fork and wiping it in the tortilla. Panchos is very runny and I didn't care for it.  The free chips and salsa are excellent, one of the best salsas I've had. Got a little kick to it, which is how I like it. I recommend this place highly",

Myself and my wife ordered enchiladas my wife's were warm but not hot, mine was cold, so after talking to the waiter he said this happens a lot and will fix it right away. So my family continues to eat  despite my wife saying we will wait for your plate. I said please continue to eat I dont want your food cold, so a couple of moments later our waiter returns with a fresh plate, yeah the plate was hot to the touch but again the inside of the enchiladas were again cold. This time asking for a manager and waiting for him to come to our table, finally he shows ( younger man ) I explain the situation and he said I'm sorry and you dont have to pay for your plate. I explained to him that even my wife's food was cold, so he said he would comp that as well. After going to this place a lot I expected that he would comp the whole meal since all four of us really were uncomfortable because I wasn't able to eat with my family. I mean we've even had birthday parties here and the food and service was excellent. I am very disappointed with them. I hope that a owner or general manager reaches out to me and offers a refund for the awful food.",

    "text": "HaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHaHa!!!!!  First off - $20 for a steak quesadilla, guacamole for $15 - AYFKM?  I could go on and on about what a ridiculous absurdity this place is, but I think it's best summed up by the following:  Pancho's - please FOAD!  I have this strange desire to laugh out loud in the face of the fool who opened this place - even if it gets me a sock in the eye.  I ordered the carne asada quesadilla and a beer.I figure a quesadilla is as good of benchmark for Mexican food as any, after all you get a tortilla to see if it is freshly made or not, steak or chicken to see how they season their meat, guacamole and salsa all in one dish. The kitchen took 20 minutes to make the quesadilla, but clearly spent no more than 20 seconds plating it. The presentation was what I would expect from Taco Bell, not a top dollar Mexican restaurant.   If after looking at the pictures you agree that it does not look appetizing, just wait till you lift up the first piece and see the waterfall of grease pouring down. I seriously had to grab a handful of napkins to soak up some of the grease that would not drip off of each piece on its own. After each slice of quesadilla was removed and de-greased, the plate was left with an ocean of grease that was starting to declare war on the guacamole.   But I wouldn't feel sorry for the guacamole, at $15 a serving, it has the budget to defend itself.  If there was something you could add to insult, after insult was added to injury, it was already added to that nasty quesadilla - it was just plain awful. The steak had a flavor, but a flavor that should be added to rodent repellent, not food. It left a nasty taste in your mouth that would not go away, even after drinking a gallon of salsa.  The salsa was decent, I have to admit. But then again it was free. The guacamole wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't worth $15.  I never got to judge the tortilla, it was soaked in so much fat there was no way to tell if it was handmade or not.  Let's just sum this crap-hole restaurant up this way:  \"Poncho's - please leave Downtown Summerlin and never return. You are a cancer on an otherwise precious young flower that deserves a chance to bloom.\"  Having said that, the bartender Steve was a pretty decent bloke.",

Food was delicious and they don't skimp on portions or meat! My enchiladas were overstuffed with crab.

Pancho's reminds us of our favorite Mexican restaurant, The Acapulco, in the Bay Area. I will agree the prices are a little high. We all agreed it was worth it. The food was great, the service was attentive and the drinks were amazing. Their happy hour is nice and we really enjoyed the vibe. Can't wait to go back!!!",

The restaurant is large and great looking but they seem to be all flash, no substance. The food is overpriced, very overpriced and nothing I ate was memorable in the least.   The chile verde burrito I ordered didn't have much flavor and the flavor it did have was a little sweet and unappetizing.  Service was standard. I have no interest in returning to Pancho's.",

It's a beautiful restaurant with colorful tiles and stained glass; numerous plants add to a very tropical feel. Service was horrible - almost nonexistent. I had to ask for a menu twice and waited 15 more minutes to get one. The waiter never came and took our order. Never. I shared nachos with a friend who has arrived ahead of me. I  gave up ordering. My other friend never ate as he was so turned off by the whole experience. The chips and salsa were very good. When we asked for more from a passing staff, we never got a refill. So we left and told the hostess that we'd never come back.",

    "text": "Preposterous. Avoid this place at all costs unless you like to be ripped off. As a Vegas local, I do NOT like to be price gouged just because a business has an expensive building and high overhead. I have a million other choices. Just because it is Summerlin also does not excuse how ridiculously marked up Pancho's entire menu is. There are plenty of restaurants in downtown Summerlin that are good and don't have these outrageous prices.   I made the mistake of not checking Yelp reviews before trying this place. I wanted an unbiased opinion because my friends and I have been waiting for this place to open for so long. It seems a lot of the Yelp reviews echo our thoughts as well. The exterior and interior *are* very beautiful. I like the openness feeling when you walk into the front entrance. The seating for waiting is a little awkward, some wooden benches and not enough of them. There is a fairly sizable bar area but we did not get a drink in the bar. My visit was on 12-5-15 on a Saturday night at around 7:30pm. We were given a pager and waited about 20 or 25 minutes, then we were led up the staircase to a small table overlooking the downstairs.   The ceiling and decor are elaborate, yes. It's very beautifully decorated. Our server was nice and friendly enough. I didn't catch her name, but service wasn't anything to write home about. And that's where anything positive ends.   They don't have a drink menu anywhere, and the little drink signs on the tables only list the brand of draft beer. NO prices anywhere. My friend ordered a Pacifico draft and I ordered a Titos vodka and club soda, and ice water. Guess it was our bad to not ask how much the drinks were...   This place isn't authentic Mexican anything. Complimentary chips and salsa are cold chips and store-bought jarred salsa with zero flavor. No hot sauce to be seen anywhere on the tables.   My friend ordered carnitas enchiladas ($19.95) and I ordered tacos de pescado (with salmon) also $19.95. It seemed that NOTHING on this menu is under $19.95... everything was extremely overpriced. The price did not reflect quality. My tacos came out and there are just two of them, and a slop of some weird beans. Yuck. I tried to pick up a salmon taco but it just falls apart. It had a lot of fillers in it, where the heck is the salmon? It's chopped up into tiny pieces, and the rest of the taco is filled with tomatoes and chopped iceberg lettuce. Disgusting. It lacked flavor, so BLAND! I tried to pick it all apart with my fork, it just wasn't worth the price.   How many freakin people do you need to constantly interrupt us to check on our table? I can count at least 6 people besides our waitress who kept trying to take our plates away. I felt a bit rushed and I don't like that. My plate didn't even look like I touched it, and my friend had quite a lot of food still, and an older gentleman came over to our table and asked if he could take our plates away. He already had his hand on my platter before I said anything, and by this time... I was SO over it. Just take it. It's too bad, I was still hungry but completely lost my appetite here.   There was some band setting up downstairs in the bar area and we could hear them practicing. Our waitress, although she was nice... seemed to rush us with the bill. Then when we got the bill, holy cow we both about lost it. $9.75 for a short glass of vodka and club soda!!?!?! $7.50 for a Pacifico DRAFT!??! WHAT!!! Our bill for two people, two drinks each, and two basic dinner entrees came to $79.95!! I saw they had tres leches on the dessert menu but seriously, $9.95 for a piece of moist cake? No thanks.   After seeing the bill with the drink prices, my friend and I were completely ticked off. And then, suddenly when we wanted to pay there was no one to be found upstairs. After all those people that were stopping at our tables, suddenly they all just disappeared. We flagged down a different waiter and settled our bill. Just a total let down experience overall.   If you want real Mexican food at reasonable prices with REAL homemade margaritas and salsa.... take my advice and go to Juan's Flaming Fajitas on Ft Apache and Tropicana on the southwest side of town. They treat you way better at Juan's and their food is so much better. Wish we went there.   Shame on the owners and management for overcharging! Never coming here again.",

    "text": "Sit down Mehxican restaurant. The place is beautiful, 5 stars if that was all you were rating on. Go into the bathroom, i mean holy cow! We went on a Monday, to catch the Vegas Cakes show and the place was pretty quiet. We sat in the cantina since that was where they were showing it and it was occupied by one other table of people and sat with a shark floating overhead. They have high tops and a couple regular height tables to choose from. Not sure if it was because we sat in the cantina, but the four of us received one menu and one happy hour flyer, the good news is we were going to be there a while so we passed the menu around. Ordered a couple margarita and they packed a punch, children had virgin daiquiris which they enjoyed. You get chips and salsa which is nice, chips were edible, but nothing to get excited about. The salsa was decent, but expected a lot more flavor for a high end Mexican place. Monday had 2.50 tacos in the cantina, we should have stuck with these, the tacos were decent and 2.50 would be a good deal. Two tacos, maybe half a cup of rice and same for beans will cost you 6 times that. The chili relleno was soggy, tasted alright though. My son beamed over his chimichanga Service was pretty good after we ordered. Check in on yelp to get a free fried ice cream. This is a fried ice cream with a lot of cinnamon. Cannot complain since it was free and it was dessert! So the food was decent, better than the rest of the countless Mexican restaurants in the valley? No.  So it boils down to okay food, good drinks and awesome decor. Our bill was well over $125 before adding a tip, with 4 drinks two of which had alcohol. Way too much, sorry.",

There is plenty of beautiful art to gaze upon as you graze on your complimentary nachos.  There was live music when we came in about an hour and a half until closing, and it really lifted the atmosphere of the place.  Service 2.5/5 Our server was not very attentive to our table.  We didn't get our water until after our food came out, and we had to ask another waiter to get it.  I feel that many of the reviews have felt that the price for the food is a bit steep.  I wouldn't complain about the price if the service was a little better.  Food 3/5 I would say the food is about the same quality of food you would get from a Cheesecake Factory.  Again, the price is a bit steep for the quality of service that we received, but the live music and ambiance helped me forgive this.  Overall 3.7/5",

There is a fountain, tall trees with lights and little birds hanging from the ceiling. Very cute! Unfortunately that's about all this place has to offer. The food and drinks are outrageously priced! My combination plate consisted of a cheese enchilada and a chicken tamale, rice and beans and it was $18.95! My husband got a combination plate with a taco and chicken tamale and it was also $18.95. He had a soda and I had water and our bill was $42, with tip it was $50. The food was not good. The tamales were very dry. My cheese enchilada had no taste to it. My husband said his taco was ok. I think Roberto's has much better food. We checked in with the Yelp app and we got a coupon for a free Fried Ice Cream. We thought ok, how can you mess up fried ice cream right? Wrong! It came in a fried tortilla shell bowl sitting in some dark brown watery substance. We had no idea what it was. Was is chocolate? Still have no idea. It kinda tasted like oil, cinnamon, sugar and a tad bit of caramel. We tried to spoon out some ice cream and it flipped over because it was a round ball floating in this strange substance. It tasted ok, but not like any fried ice cream I've ever had.  Maybe I'd try this place again but not for food. Maybe for a drink in the bar. They really need to drop their prices. Just because it's located in Downtown Summerlin doesn't mean it should be overpriced. I'd rather go down the street to Macayos for much better food and half the price.",

Bring your parents here! It has a place in my rotation for sure and I am a regular at the more authentic places. Great job on the decor too, it felt like a place that's been around a long time.  My only criticism is price. It's 10-15% more expensive than I'd like. Let's face it, that building wasn't cheap! Maybe when things settle they'll give us a break or some coupons or something.  As far as the negative reviews, most of them sound like what happens when you open a new place. It'll get better.  The fountain was clean by the way!",

The food looked and smelled amazing...but was really just ok tasting.   I'm kind of a Mexican food snob as it's my all time favorite food on the planet and eat it several times a week, both at home and at various restaurants.  Since it was my aunt's favorite new place since it opened I had really high hopes. So I was a little disappointed that it was only ok tasting.  It was VERY expensive too! Lunch for 2 with a margarita each was around $60 with tip! Come on! That's way too much for two people for mexican food.",

Although our tacos were out within five minutes of ordering, they were not worth eating. They had absolutely no flavor and were greasy since the taco shells are fried. The ambience of the restaurant area is very nice, I just wish they had better food.",

However, not wanting to waste the food, my girlfriend accepted the incorrect taco plate after we discussed the issue with the waiter.   Only problem was it was much more expensive than what she actually ordered, and the guy charged us for the more expensive plate. Wow.  I did not accept the wrong food, but was inexplicably charged for the more expensive combo he had originally brought me. Unbelievable.   Then on top of that, the food was very mediocre. That's probably being kind. My enchiladas tasted like they were made with American cheese.   We won't be back. Prices here are out of control considering you could go to Javier's for the same price and actually get some great food.",

This could just be a matter of taste but I like them light and crispy. I asked for them to fry up some flower tortilla chips, which every other Mex restaurant I've asked to do that, does so with a smile. The waiter asked the kitchen and reported back that the flower tortillas were to thin. I had flower tortillas with my meal, they were normal tortillas, so, translation, I don't want to. And the guacamole was on the bland side. This is quite possibly the most expensive restaurant I've ever been to but when you read the last page of the menu, you discover why. I'm guessing a build out of well over a million. After dinner we went downstairs to have drinks and listen to a rock cover band, a much needed venue in DT Summerlin. We've said since DT Summerlin's opening that a music venue was sorely lacking. thanx Pancho's for filling the gap.",

    "text": "I typically am not the one to leave reviews but after reading some of these 1 star comments, I feel inclined to share my opinions.  My experience at Pancho's was spectacular! It was just what I was looking for to start my weekend after a very long Friday at work. When I walked in, I felt as if I was transported to the middle of a Mexican jungle, instantly all my work stress was left at the door. The lush greenery, authentic aztec/mayan relics, stained glass windows, and beautiful water fountain created a very calming and soothing ambiance, in what was still a very busy restaurant. The wait time was brief. When I got my table, I ended up getting seated upstair. This was great because I received a wonderful view of the entire restaurant. Sitting upstair you could really get an expansive view of all the detail that went into designing this restaurant.  As soon as I sat down, I was greeted with warm chips and delicious salsa. The waiter was extremely professional and instantly introduced himself. He asked if we had been here before and then began to give us the story of Pancho's. Very interesting story, I had no idea the history and tradition of this place that dates all the way back to 1945 in Southern California.   The menu at Pancho's is extensive. They serve classic items like a combination plate but I suggest exploring one of the many authentic dishes they have to offer. In particular their seafood section! I ended up going with Enchiladas de Langosta however the Shrimp Diabla Puffy Tacos did catch my eye. While I waited for my dinner, I ordered a Naughty Maggie Margarita (A MUST ORDER AFTER A LONG WEEK OF WORK)! This was one of the best margaritas I have had in Nevada, 3 or 4 of these and you are in for quite the night. As I finished off my chips and salsa I was quickly replenished with more before I could even ask, love this type of service! Especially when the chips and salsa are this tasty. When I received my meal, it was fresh out of the oven, the cheese was still bubbling and I was warned of the hot plate. These enchiladas were excellent, the lobster was cooked and seasoned nicely and the chipotle cream sauce stole the show. It was accompanied with delicious rice and beans. Very large portions, I was extremely full and I highly recommend this dish.   After enjoying my dinner, I got up and headed downstairs to the bar. When I walked into the bar, I was excited to see the ample amounts of space and TVs. I sat at the bar and ordered another Naughty Maggie Margarita which was of course accompanied with some more chips and salsa! I thought I was full but ended up finding some extra room for them...I guess they were that good! The bar was perfect, comfy seating, great margs, beautiful women, and lots of sports.  As the games were ending, I noticed that a band was setting up. At this point, I was ready to leave but wanted to know what was going on. The manager, Abbott (very nice guy), informed me that there is live entertainment 7 days a week. He told me, the entertainment consist of comedy, karaoke, and live music depending on the night. I was thrilled as I knew this would be my next date spot, I mean who does not like live entertainment and strong drinks! I ended up staying to hear a few songs from the band. Classic rock cover songs, yes please!!!!   I highly recommend Pancho's for any occasion and definitely suggest checking it out for yourself. The atmosphere alone is worth the trip!",

The staff were all very nice, from the host staff, to our server & busser.  I ordered Enchiladas Suizas, and they were very good.  My brother had a Quesadilla with Chorizo & Eggs, and he said that was also very good.  As some others have said, it was a little pricey, but that is not a particular concern of mine.  It is also a little noisy, but not too bad.  I recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind the high prices.",

Chili Relleno was small, overcooked and had some unidentifiable chewy things in it!  Cheese in all dishes was gooey and hard to eat.  Rice was dry.  No happy hour rates if you sit in the restaurant (first place we've experienced this!)  Prices were much higher than other places we go and you get less food.",

    "text": "Bring your wallet! Just because this place is in Downtown Summerlin, they think they can get away with charging outrageous -- and I do mean OUTRAGEOUS -- prices for simple Americanized Mexican food. Yes, the restaurant is gorgeous inside, with colorful clay tiles and a fountain in the middle of the dining room, but they are putting the high cost of their primo real estate onto unsuspecting customers' backs.   I love Mexican food and Pancho's drew me in with an appealing menu. The first sign that this was going to be a disappointing meal was when the waiter brought out complimentary chips and salsa for the table. I judge a place by its chips, and these were pretty awful. They were cold, not salted at all, and honestly tasted like they were out of a big bag. They had to be. Ditto for the salsa, runny and bland and just gross. Pass.   Next up was the queso fundido with artichoke hearts. This tasted more like Paula Deen's artichoke dip than Mexican queso, so don't order this if you just want tasty melted cheese. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. Wouldn't get this again.   I was dining with two friends and one had a beef quesadilla with a margarita, and the other had fajitas. I ordered the Especial de Cabo. The food ranged from truly inedible to mediocre, and all of it was grossly overpriced (see the pattern here)? NOBODY was happy with their meal.   The kitchen was easy to work with and swapped out grilled vegetables for the rice, which I appreciated. The veggies were good and the flavor of the dish was acceptable, but what was so nasty was the huge puddle of water that settled into the bottom of my plate. It was extremely unpleasant to have to dig my food out of this murky water. The kitchen needs to do a better job draining the water and grease off of the food! As expected, my meal was very light on the meat (chicken breast, shrimp and crab meat -- it had like 3 shrimp total and one little scoop of crab meat), but there were at least some decent sized avocado chunks. This was a pretty good low carb dish in terms of creativity and flavor, but it was just too pricey for me to justify eating it regularly.    The biggest offense here is that the tortillas aren't homemade. Every good Mexican restaurant ought to make their own tortillas. (At least they brew their own iced tea, and it was delicious).   One friend ordered the fried ice cream for us to share and it was the superstar of the meal. But really, how can dessert NOT be delicious? I laughed at the miniature American and Mexican flags that were stuck in the top of our dessert because this had to be the most inauthentic Mexican meal I have ever had!   The service was abysmal too. We had to wait forever for drink refills and for the check, and our server brought out our queso appetizer without any chips or any plates, so we had to sit there while our queso got colder and colder. Epic fail on the inattentive service.   The three of us were left with disappointing meals and a disappointing experience all around and a whopping check for $165 for lunch. LUNCH! One hundred and sixty five dollars!!!! Talk about a genuine rip-off in the greatest sense of the word!  I won't be returning to Pancho's.",

    "text": "I'm giving Pancho's a 4 star rating because we did have a great experience. The staff was welcoming and informative, even management cake over and offered a money saving suggestion for next time. (Thanks Jimmy!)  My three littles each had enchiladas. They enjoyed them. No complaints.  I ordered Enchiladas de Avocado y Artichoke. It was lovely. Everything I could've hoped for after reading the description. My jalapeno margarita scored a 7/10.  Hubby enjoyed some steak tacos & a beer.   In addition to our entrees we also ordered a large Guac for the table. $15! I know we are in Summerlin but JESUS!  Our check came to $123. Roughly. Typically I wouldn't budget a dinner for the 5 of us for over $80. Fortunately I snagged a coupon for 1 free entree and left a $24 tip. So $130 out the door.  So to break it down for you: Expensive. Great service. Good quality (fresh) food. Don't expect authentic Mexican cuisine.  The restaurant itself is BEAUTIFUL.   We will probably avoid coming back with the littles and stick to the happy hour and bar areas for just the two of us. Big savings over there.",

Pancho's looks like it belongs right in the heart of Old Town and it was a nice suprise that reminded me a little of home.   The ambiance is wonderful. You ffeel like you're sitting outside but not in the insufferable heat or wind that Vegas has. The servers running up and down the stairs was a little unnerving.  The food is a little pricier than Lindo (which was our previous preferred spot for disappointing Mexican food) but you're paying for ambiance, and for us, convenience. The service was very attentive and sincere.  We enjoyed the pescado ceviche (yum! - the more sour the better), Carne Asada quesdilla (meat was tender and flavorful), and the shrimp/crab enchiladas (I was so happy to be able to choose one of each!). For dessert we had the FREE... FREEEEEE fried ice cream! It was a good ending to our meal, especially since it was free (when you check in on YELP).   I wish they had horchata to round out my meal. They do have an extensive selection of spirits and cocktails which looked good.  I'll come back for sure! I'm always getting coupons for Panchos in the mail so even better!",

The first time was around Christmas 2018 when hubby and I stopped in for a few quick appetizers. It was such a great break. I thoroughly enjoyed the keyboard player entertaining the crowd with Christmas tunes. The second time I came with my daughter and we purposely sat in the bar again to enjoy the keyboard player again (I've come to know his name is Grant Peacock). HIs music is very entertaining and makes for a lively atmosphere while dining on DELICIOUS food! If you're looking for a weeknight evening out with food and music, Pancho's is definitely an option. My Carne Asada salad was perfection, the warm chips they serve are fantastic and the service was right on par. Pricing is a little on the higher side for a Mexican restaurant, I will admit. However, the quality and taste of the food, coupled with the entertainment, made my dollars well-spent. One of these days I'll actually sit in the restaurant, but for now the music is what captivates me each time. Oh and those chips! Go out and enjoy!",

    "text": "Not a great meal.   The star is literally for the company and the nice looking building.    I was yet again disappointed in another execution of so called Mexican food and why they think it's acceptable to charge so outrageously for. It's not like you get gold plated beans served here. In my opinion you can't even call it Mexican just because you stuff a tortilla with rice and beans. Maybe we are actually helping to pay for the building, decor and uniforms.  I actually was whishing I was at Cafe Rio since at least their rice is eatable instead of hard grains that can do some real tooth damage.   The seafood burrito I ordered tasted like the seafood was one minute away from going bad.  It was just not okay by any stretch.  And it wasn't just my dish.  I think only 2 out of the 6 of us enjoyed their meal. The average isn't good.   The server was okay in the begining and just got mediocre towards the middle and unhelpful at the end. They seem to put more emphasis in replenishing the chips than anything else, but too bad I didn't come here for the chips.  I can't even take a risk coming back to try something else.  Also if paying $$ for Mexican food makes you think it is high end or of better quality maybe you need to try a $ Mexican food place and compare... just for kicks. Que mala comida sirven aqui. No costea, que lastima por querer aparentar tan prestigioso lugar.",

I grew up in summerlin and it's my favorite go to Mexican food craving  place. It's very pretty inside, also very clean and I've never had bad service there. I usually get the combination plate 2 beef tacos, it's very good. I get chips with the bean dip, it's very good. And I usually get the tres leche dessert, soo good. The wait staff is always very nice, I think overal they forgot my drink order one time.  And my food always comes out hot. It isn't priced cheap but in comparison it's not far off from the other Mexican restaurants in summerlin, and I don't mind paying a little more for the pretty ambiance, good food, and friendly wait staff. Also location is great in downtown summerlin, convienent, lots to do.",

    "text": "It's very rare for me to eat at a 3 star restaurant (yes, I am a food snob) but I will make an exception when it's a brand new restaurant.  I don't think it's fair to rush out to a brand new anything and expect it to be running like a well-oiled machine.  Everyone and everything is new and needs a little time to get acclimated as you do at a new job or at something you have never done.  I was willing to give them a chance and I'm glad I did.  I have been twice in the last week and both experiences were great.  The hostesses are warm and welcoming and get you seated fairly quickly.  I was able to make reservations which I always appreciate and they sat us before the entire party arrived which is a plus.  Both servers were attentive and got our orders correct.  The manager stopped by our table both times to make sure that all was well.    My husband really likes the cadillac margarita and the fajitas.  The queso is very different (cream cheese, cheese and artichoke hearts) but was very good.  You can't skip dessert at a Mexican restaurant...Flan, Tres Leches and Fried Ice Cream...oh yes!!!  I need a new paragraph for this item, the Carne Asada Quesadilla.  Oh my word!!  It happened to be cheat day and a quesadilla sounded delicious but it's hard to find a good one.  I couldn't be happier that I ordered one here.  The tortilla was super fresh, perfection really.  The cheese was plentiful.  Then there is the carne asada, oh man!  If you are a fellow quesadilla snob you know that your quesadilla could come out with big chunks of beef, no thank you, or fatty pieces of meat, um no, or hardly any meat at all, no bueno!  However, Pancho's has got it right with perfect small strips of super juicy carne asada with perfect flavor.  Oh man was it good!  Cheat day + Pancho's Carne Asada Quesadilla = One happy girl!  The prices reflect location, it's Summerlin!  If you live in Summerlin you are use to paying a higher price tag and if you are driving from afar you must realize you are driving to Summerlin.",

I ordered the street tacos and had to send them back Then, I ordered the shrimp tacos. The tortilla was falling apart and they were just filled with lettuce. When I finally bit a shrimp, there was almost no seasoning so all I could taste was lettuce.  I ended up paying for a meal and not eating it. :(",

When it comes to first impressions, it was love at first sight. A major wow factor! Whoever designed this place deserves 5 stars. They brought the beauty of Mexico to us in Vegas! It reminded me of the movie ~ Original Sin with Angelina Jolie.   I do have one note about the design and that's the little room behind the beautiful staircase. I highly suggest that room is used for private parties & events only because customers don't get the True experience sitting there. We were guided over to it and I said no way, then we were sat in the lovely courtyard & I couldn't get enough of that space! Art, central fountain & greenery surrounded us and I loved it all.   The service was fantastic & I'm even going to give a shoutout to Jason who took great care of us and was also very sweet & funny.   The food was good, not amazing. I've definitely had better but everything also tasted better sitting in this space. We also only tried one thing but that's how it goes sometimes. We ordered the enchiladas de Langosta which were filled with lots of luscious lobster. Prices are high here but they definitely didn't gip us on the seafood. I also need to add that the portions are HUGE. We shared and couldn't even finish everything.   The black beans lacked in flavor & were a tad undercooked. The green rice was perfect and the creamy chipotle sauce was super rich, a tad too rich for me. Overall it was good but not amazing. I needed bolder flavors but I'm still interested in going back & trying something else. The menu itself offered a lot of classics & a few unique dishes so it'll have something for everyone.",

After a 20 minute wait on a Friday night, our buzzer went off and we were seated at our table of 7. Our waiter came over to deliver chips and salsa, take our drink orders and answer questions. My hubby rapped in Spanish with him after noticing some food item mentioned Tijuana and really the food origin was Mexico City.  After discovering the waiter and us had lived very close to one another in Mexico City, he brought us over guacamole. Delish!!!  Food items ordered; chicken fajitas (very good, mushrooms with onions and sliced bell peppers), chicken mole (good), a mixed pork and chicken platter (said to be tasty) and chicken tacos and a taco salad for the kids (all said to be very good). It's definitely not \"authentic\" Mexican, it's that Americanized Tex-Mex, but it's still good. The prices are a bit steep, but that's to be expected in this area of Summerlin. Total bill for 7, 4 kids meals, 3 adults, no cocktails was $145, tip not included. We ordered cocktails at the bar, 2 beers and a vodka-club was $40-ish.  Service was amazing, drinks refilled immediately and our waiter and multiple bussers came to add drinks, clear plates, etc.  We lied and said it was our friend's bday and could they sing happy bday to him. They came over at the end of the meal and gave him fried ice cream, put on the sombrero and sang. Oh, the stupid stuff we do for a 40 second laugh... We're lame.... Yesterday we had our Super Bowl party catered by Pancho's; platters of chicken enchiladas, carne asada, marinated chicken, rice, beans, chips,salsa, very good!  Will definitely return to Pancho's when we need our Mexican food fix.",

Everything was my liking but the Food.  It's so sad they can't serve better food.  I don't mind paying little more for the better location, the better service and the BETTER FOOD! We ordered the tacos, enchiladas, tamales, salad and guacamole and none of them are up to par. They are not bad, just not that good. It's a shame.  Five stars for the service and the  atmosphere and three stars for the food.",

We were sat next to the water fountain and it was beautiful.   Secondly the wait staff. Jose was our main waiter but every single person who passed our table took a brief moment to check on us. Whether it be to fill our drinks or ask about the food. You can tell they all have each other's back.   Third the food, it was amazing. And print. We sat at 645 and they had out food to us by 7 and that's with us not knowing what to order!   It was a little pricey but it was so very worth it.",

Place is beautifully appointed with the upscale Mexican decor and vibe, staff was attentive and friendly.  I am never insulted by prices, but for the food and drink I received, I noticed no difference in my culinary experience than I would not have found at Lindo Michocan down the street.  My fish tacos and refried beans were good, but I felt they were the exact same quality I could get other places.   Sure my fish tacos came on a lovely Michael Aram looking silver platter, sure the staff checked on us attentively a dozen times in the hour we were sitting there, sure this location in the Summerlin hot spot of Downtown Summerlin, but the quality of food is nothing off the charts to warrant the price nor my return visit.  I am not saying I would not ever go back, but if given a choice, I would choose not to and go elsewhere.",

As  for the services, the server didnt know much about some of the entrees and also couldnt say what the names were. The food was alright. I ordered the carne asada burrito but was told they dont have that... odd right? Anyways they have a philly burrito (Which is the equivalent to a carne asada burrito but they failed to mention that) Presentation of the dish was nice but quality of the food lacked, the meat wasnt seasoned per \"carne asada\" just tasted like peppered steak.  Drink selection was pretty basic, didnt have any common \"mexican\" drinks  Prices???? Extremely expensive for what you are getting. In my honest opinion it is a bad replica of Lindo Micohacon.

Friendly and Efficient   Appetizers Are Really Good- note- Get The shredded beef nachos ;)  Atmosphere is perfect for a family gathering or a nice dinner for two.   Dinner was pretty good. Our waitress Carrissa was extremely professional, friendly and offered Wonderful customer service. That is ALWAYS a  plus when you go out to eat!  Our Appetizer (Shredded Beef Nachos) came out promptly. It was more than enough for the 3 of us to share.   The shredded beef was really good and the nachos had an exact amount of cheese, shredded beef, jalapenos ratio going on to make it a delicious meal within itself.  My enchilada sauce was a bit different. Not quite red, not quite brown basically a combo of the two colors. It wasn't hot at all. Maybe it was tex-mex? I'm not sure. I personally did not care for it. I think I will go with a Verde next time.    Husband had a shredded beef burrito which was delicious minus the cheese sauce NO BUENO. It wasn't good at all.   Personally, I believe, if the sauces were changed it would help the dish be the amazing dish is was meant to be!! Nothing can kill a dish more than a  meh- nah sauce that drowns out the delicious flavors under it. For now,  I recommend skipping the sauces. Just my opinion of course.   In all fairness- My suggestion is that  I  would love to see this restaurant create another Red Chile sauce. You know more traditional Mexican Red Chile Sauce please :)   Beans and rice were pretty good.  Based on Location, Atmosphere, Customer Service, And Delicious Appetizers I Would Recommend.",

Two were traveling so we picked here to meet. Upon my arrival I was told they had been waiting 10mins....then we waited another 20 mins. We were told they were waiting for a table to leave so they could sit us all together. After 30+ minutes we then asked if we could sit in the bar area since some of our party was on lunch break from work. So we entered the bar area ,we moved our tables together and the bar tender now had a large paty to help!!!. She managed to serve us on her own, unlike the large dining room couldn't handle us.",

You get the other nonsense like beans and rice. Let's be honest we are there to eat the tacos not the beans. I thought they gave you soup with every meal, that isn't True. So why is it so expensive for some decent tacos!   You get chips & salsa which is always nice. If they ask you for guacamole say NO it's 9 bucks! The food flavor is just normal. Trust me the only thing that stands out with this place is the scenery inside. Not worth the price for average tasting food.",

    "text": "I went here with a group of friends last night. The place has a good Mexican feel with the decorations. The meals are very overpriced with what you get and the food is okay and not the best tasting. It doesn't taste like authentic Mexican food. Customer service was mediocre. Also some of us had the yelp free cream deal and the waiter wouldn't give it to everyone that had it. He limited our table so we were upset about that. I got the lobster enchiladas and within a few hours I spent most of my night and morning throwing up and in the bathroom. It was one of the worst experience in my life. I called the manager the next day and her name is Mallory and she said she would check into the expiration date of the lobster and she apologized and said that there has not been any experiences of any food poisoning or anyone reporting any sickness and that it was probably just my stomach. I felt that was bad customer service. She said she hopes I come back and did not offer anything else. It was the only thing I ate that day all day and I know that was what made me sick. So this is why am rating them only one star and I will not be back to this place at all. Check other reviews on this site because there is a lot of bad reviews about this restaurant also about the over pricing and the taste of their food and other people getting sick. I've been a manager for over 20 years of my life and I would've accommodated my customers better than she did. She was not very nice on the phone and accommodating at all and she made me feel like it was my stomach and not her food.",

We had the Chili Verde meal and a Carne Asada Salad. Both entrees were very good. Generous portions and quite tasty. Fairly authentic Mexican (not overly Americanized). Complimentary chips and salsa provided at the table. Service was prompt and courteous. Prices are reasonable but not cheap. We will definitely be back when we are again hungry for Mexican food.",

What we got was anything but authentic. The tortilla/ chicken soup and the abondigas  soup tasted like they were made from the same soup base. The flour tortillas were horrible store bought. The Spanish rice was bland and the frejoles de la ollia.  Were straight out of a can.  The sopas were marginal at best. I've had better \"Mexican\" food at taco bell. Very over priced for store bought food. Very disappointing.",

    "text": "Man today we stumbled up Panchos and I wish I had tried this place out sooner.. we discovered it from the directory in downtown summerlins shopping area but decided to try to check this place out . It is in the parking lot where Trader Joe's is and has lots of parking .  Upon entry I fell in love with the decor ..  We were here around lunch time and had Agustin as our server he was super friendly . Their menu is large and it isn't \"cheap\" which I admit at first alarmed me but let me tell you the quality of the food definitely made up for the cost .  We got our free chips and salsa and chowed those down a long with our Diet Coke which came with a little pitcher that lasted our whole meal . It's a pet peeve of mine to run out of soda so I was stoked about that .. I definitely saw tons of stuff on the menu I wanted but opted to let our server choose by asking his favorite item on the menu .  Just my luck he loved the Philly Cheesesteak Burrito and helped my Mom pick this chicken and mango salad and they both were awesome . Which was delivered to our table with a smile and friendly greeting from Gustavo.  The steak was super tender and the veggies delicious but not too over powering and the red sauce on top was top  notch neither of us could finish our whole portion but man did we try! I tasted the salad my mom GoT and the chicken was really flavorful and not chewy and the greens and fruit were super fresh it had mango and grapes and pepita seeds ? I think but either way it was yummy!  If you check in here you can currently get a free fried icecream but we were too full to try it out ..  Over all for $40something we got two sodas and entrees and could of had dessert.. but even Hector was super friendly while clearing our table ...  When we were leaving I stopped to take pictures of the bar area ... guess who else is super nice??? Daniel the bartender who wanted to pose for a photo and who comes around the corner ? My server Agustin to joke around saying I don't want one of him..  It's clear to me this place employs the right people who must have good management keeping them happy .. definitely can't wait to come try some margaritas and happy hour specials",

No drink menu... the response was \"it's like an open bar so just ask for something and we'll see if we can make it. \" Wife asked for a Paloma which is a simple tequila drink. Didn't offer choice of tequila and it came with a very low quality well tequila called Zarco. Drink was horrible. My wife asked for a spicy red salsa and the manager came back with a bottle of Tapatio and a bottle of Louisiana hot sauce then explained that the Tapatio is good hot stuff!

Restaurants are planned to sit people comfortable... here you have the feeling they are trying to add as many tables as they can. We are not coming back because 2 Magueritas (not impressed at all both with size and taste) one appetizer (they basically warmed up CREAM cheese... yes cream cheese, and diced up some jalapenos and called that a cheese dip) a Taco salad and a quesadilla for $80.00 it is to much.. We normally have the same stuff on other competitor's locations and we don't spend more than $50... with more volume, and the most important... wayyyyyyy better food, with very comfortable tables.",

    "text": "Nice new interior and attentive staff.  I agree with many of the other reviewers; the prices are a bit steep for just average Mexican food.  Our party of 2 had one Margarita, one soda,  a shared appetizer, a taco entree and a fajita entree.  The bill including tax and tip was over $90; a bit high for the type and quality of food.  It was not bad and we will probably return but just not a WOW.  Also, this is an aside and perhaps just an issue for that evening but the bus staff was constantly bringing rolling carts of bus trays, glasses and dishes thru the main restaurant.  Our table was right in their path so we were constantly looking at carts of serving and kitchen supplies as were dining.  Again, maybe this was temporary but kind of odd to have bus bins 2 feet from your entree.",

Too expensive for the caliber of food.  Very basic dishes and not much flavor.  We just moved to the area so their mailer brought the restaurant to our attention.  I'm not looking to impress anyone.  Just looking to relax and have a good healthy meal, so atmosphere is less important. That being said I think I would rather go to Sharky's or Wahoo's for the quality of food and it's a fraction of the price. We were looking forward to becoming regulars because of their first impression but I think we decided to cross it off our list since the food is what really matter.",

It has been several years since we have been back but at this location prices seemed a bit high even given the location.   The first negative sign was when we nearly finished our chips and salsa before our order was even taken. The second negative was when I ordered the chicken tortilla soup and never received it. After our main entrees arrived I mentioned this to our server and he apologized and later gave an additional discount which was very nice. The last negative was food quality. Let's be honest, most Mexican sit downs seem to taste the same unless they have a signature stand out dish/item, or the style of cooking/preparation is different. Pancho's was no different. There was nothing about their food that justified the price point.   Unfortunately,  we didn't even stay to use  the Yelp fried ice cream offer. We paid and left. However, I had the last laugh and ordered a second helping of the free chips and salsa...",

    "text": "So I happened to be at downtown Summerlin, and I stopped in to try this place on a Sunday, and discovered a gem. The restaurant itself is gorgeous, and the bar is awe inspiring. It is probably the best designed Mexican restaurant I have seen.  The fruit and champagne was a great way to start. I ordered the puffy shrimp tacos, and could barely finish them. All of that plus the cinnamon  bunuelos made the price of $20.99 worth it.  I did think that some of the items were overpriced, like the guacamole and huevos ranchero, but enjoyed my meal.  I stopped in again on Monday which is ladies' night and had an even better experience. 1/2 prices apps, and $5 margaritas, plus live music, by a guy named Edgar, whose mix of classic Latin sound crossed with some modern songs made my night.  The service I received from Jason who was behind the bar was amazing. Not only was he attentive, making sure I never had to ask for anything, but the guy makes a mean margarita! He talked me into trying one of his bloody Mary's.  The best one I have ever had was at a bar in Los Angeles back in 1989. His blew that one away! As I watched him make it, his ratio of ingredients should not have worked, but was I wrong.  It will be even longer before I find someone to top him!  Jason talked me into trying the chile verde, which was a great call. I would not have been able to finish it even if I had not ordered an app before hand.  Portion size was ridiculous.  This has no become my favorite Monday night hang out because of the amazing cantina area, great bartender, and entertainment.  Well done, guys!",

After receiving a coupon in the mail for a BOGO entree, we decided to try it out and are happy we did.  First, the restaurant looks like a house and the main dining room has a courtyard feel. It is open and full of fake plants and trees (it's a bit much). Our server was polite and the server assistant also quickly came with their chips and salsa. Pancho's salsa was excellent with a nice kick and their chips were good as well. I ordered the wahoo fish tacos and my partner got a very large burrito of some kind. My tacos were also excellent and he said the burrito was great too! I did order a house margarita on the rocks and it was just ok. It was quite strong, not really that good, and was over $10! This was for their house margarita! To me, this is a bit overpriced, especially if the house margarita doesn't consist of premium ingredients.  All in all, we will definitely be back to Pancho's. My fish tacos were really quite good and I love a good salsa. I will definitely not order the house margarita and wish they would clean up all the clutter in the dining room as far as the fake plants and such. Again, the service was quite friendly and that will always being us back again and again.",

Same as any other place in town, but the atmosphere, service and food were better than anywhere else I've been in town!  And I've been here for over 40 years!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND PANCHO'S!  I've already told all my friends about it....you'll love it!",

    "text": "This was the grossest Mexican food I've ever had. I was so embarassed for my life being at this establishment. It was so so so expensive (20$ for 2 tacos?!) LOL  Me and bf got the trios enchiladas (chicken beef and cheese) and some birreria de something it was basically shredded beef chunks with pinto beans and rice. The enchiladas were so good except for the chicken one! I received a side plate and opened it up it was literally chicken mush?! It looked and tasted like baby food so I sent it back but nice enough the manager comped my meal. The other entree was good except for the bland sauce and the weird microwaved looking oily bland tortilla soup.  The drinks were okay, 13$ for a margarita and 8$ for my michelada. My michelada was delicious. The server was pretty good, attentive and responded well whenever I flagged him down!  I will come back to try other dishes hoping the food is better",

Yes, it's pricey, but it's Downtown Summerlin - also the portions are legit. I came during lunch and have to say - I'm down with the authentic ambience. Plus, the high ceilings are decor are awesome.   I ordered the Birria and it was delicious! The two people I ate with were also very happy with the food. It was definitely a more expensive lunch than normal...BUT they also have a good happy hour. I didn't get a chance to experience it but it looked like a great deal.  Bottom line - don't trust the bad reviews, go try Pancho's for yourself. The food was much better than I expected and if you don't love it, at least it's nice to look at!",

Thumbing through the menu, looking for the lunch menu, there is not one. Looking at the prices at the cheapest entree is $14.95 and it goes way up from there.   Strip pricing meets Downtown Summerlin.  Someone sure spent a lot of money on the building and its very nice on the inside. I ordered the two beef tacos with double rice, Tasted bland was not anything extraordinary at all.  My clients bill was $65 which was for 3 entrees and 3 iced teas- too much especially at lunch.

The food on the happy hour menu is good on the weekends even though the menu says drinks only Saturday and Sunday. The waitress made sure we were aware. Started with chips and salsa and they were really good.   Ordered the appetizer platter which was amazing. So good and highly recommend. My friend got the tortilla soup and said it was delish. We also ordered the Queso- this tasted like a dish of sour cream, and was huge. The waitress noticed we weren't eating it and asked about it, we told her it wasn't our favorite or what we expected and she said she would take it off the bill no problem. (She also mentioned they are taking it off the menu).   We also each got two drinks  Bill split in half was $28. Could be cheaper especially for happy hour, but was good.",

As soon as we sat down, we were served chips and salsa.  There is a lot of food on the menu, but I don't see that as a bad thing.  There's a lot to choose from which means you don't have to get the same thing over and over when you come back.  I had the Trio Los Pancho's and they were amazing.  My girlfriend had the artichoke quesadilla and devoured it.  Some of the reviews say this place is a bit pricey, but I guess they've never eaten in Las Vegas before.  I felt the price was right on par for downtown Summerlin.  Before we left, we were greeted by the manager, Mallory, and asked about our dining experience.  Mallory was extremely receptive to our feedback and was genuinely interested in what she and the restaurant could do better.  I would highly recommend Pancho's to anyone whose looking for something other than the same ole dining experience.",

The service was great considering how busy they were and the food was totally not their fault but I probably won't go back. There is a lot of good Mexican food in Las Vegas so I feel like I'd get more good food for less $$$ at other places around town.   Even my totally non picky husband was underwhelmed by their soup or all things. He ate the meatballs in the abondigas  soup and left everything else.   The masa for my tamale was so grainy it overtook the flavor. Another person got the Chile Colorado and said the beef had no flavor and felt like it had sat a while.  The tres leches cake was so dry we actually sent it back who has ever heard of a dry tres leches cake?  The beers ($6.75) and margaritas ($13.50) were good but not enough to go for just drinks. Just because they are in downtown Summerlin doesn't justify their over priced plates and inconsistent flavors. Good luck Pancho's - Vegas is a place foodies will not put up with this.",

We went with the waiters recommendation because things were kinda pricey and I looked around the restaurant and didn't see anything necessarily worth the price. We ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp and were treated to five pieces of shrimp on some rice with grilled vegetables. A $27 that seems like a lot especially when one of those pieces of shrimp did not get eaten because it was not deveined. We also paid another $20 for a steak quesadilla and the meat inside tasted like what happens to steak if you cook it, put it in the refrigerator, and try to warm it up the next day. The drinks were hitting mess because mine was quite strong whereas my dining partner's was not. Overall I will not come back here there are other places here in Vegas that are so much better for Mexican food.",

It's like a big open atrium inside with lots of trees, hanging birds, a fountain and so on. A huge negative - we were seated right next to the fountain and it smelled like mold/sewer. Every time some passed by it wafted towards our table. Very unappealing. They have a big menu with loads of options; the prices definitely run a little high.   Unfortunately, we were very disappointed with our food. They serve complimentary chips and salsa And the salsa is tasty. We ordered the artichoke queso fundido. It was like no other queso fundido I've ever had. It was essentially a skillet of warm sour cream/cream cheese. The consistency was like a dip, not like ooey gooey cheese. No caramelization. No bueno. We also ordered the beef taquitos described as spicy. They were bland. No flavor. I had the sopa de albondigas (meatball soup); this did have nice flavor!! Others at the table were disappointed with enchiladas, chile rellano and a seafood entree. Everything lacked flavor and pizazz and seemed overpriced.   I didn't have a cocktail or I might say to come for the surroundings and a drink.    I likely won't return. Too many other tasty Mexican choices",

They shouldn't have table at that spot. Overall they need to remove some tables from the place period!! Not comfy seating environment. The manager dropped a dirty fork on my friend's shoulder and didn't even apologize. We asked for a move, which took another 20 minutes because the host forgot about us. Finally they moved us to another table. The manager came smoozed with us after but he never acknowledged the fork incident.   The food is mediocre, I ordered a $25 menu item which should've of been $11.99 at most places. It's very overpriced, these prices work for Manhattan Beach , CA for their original location, not Vegas. The food is bland and uninspiring, especially when we have amazing Mexican food here like Lindo, La Mojarra Loca...etc etc. To diners who love food, this is a skip!",

You are paying for the decor and construction costs, and not getting quality or tasty food in return.   I ate here last week for lunch, after being told there was a two hour wait on opening day (despite the restaurant not being full).  I was seated immediately this time, after the hostess rudely remarking that she remembered me from the previous week.  I was brought to a table near the base of the stairs... So far so good.  Although the water in the fountain was green and cloudy.  I ordered a chicken chimi and iced tea. This was around 2:30 pm and it still took about 45 minutes for my food to come out.  By that time I'd eaten way too many chips (yeah they're good although the salsa is just meh) and wasn't very hungry.  Which is good because my chimi was the smallest burrito I've ever seen.  It was dry and lacking in flavor and I left half of it and the beans and rice (also meh) on my plate.  Definitely not impressed.  I've had better food for a fifth of the price at Roberto's Taco Shop, and that's saying something, since I think Roberto's is also crap!",

We came on a Sunday around 1:00. They had a brunch menu in addition to a dinner menu. Huge selection of entrees on the dinner menu, all ranging from 17.95 and up. The four adults in our party all agreed that there wasn't anything special about the food. I had a chimichunga and the chicken was super dry and the shell was over fried. Rice, no Bueno. The menu also stars at the bottom 10.95 minimum per person. Seriously!  Not sure if they would have enforced it.   They brought some of our drinks in plastic cups. For $18/person you ought to be able to put the drink in a glass.   Kids meals were $10 each as well. Fine if you don't want to cater to kids but seriously. My son had a pizza and before you say it... yes, don't order pizza at a Mexican restaurant.  It's all about the taste and quality of the food. I will pay $30 for a $30 steak. I will pay more if I am in a casino or high tourist area. I expect quality if I am going to pay this much and this place failed miserably.",

The chips were decent and salsa was good but nothing particularly delicious.  The queso had mixed reviews at our table some members of our party loved it. Other hated it. If you are a fan of artichoke cream cheese dip you might be interested in this.  The steak salads were decent. Meat seemed overly salted but overall not bad.  The chicken tacos were the flop of the evening. Extremely greasy and tasteless.  The beans and rice were fair.   The carnitas enchiladas were the favorite at the table. I recommend those out of all the dishes we tried.   The fried ice cream was so - so. The only downfall was it was greasy...   Mediocre food but the real kicker was the price of the food! $20 for two tacos with a small side of beans and rice is outrageous.  That's the reason for the two stars. Average to below average Mexican cuisine at sky high prices.   I won't be returning.",

Tiles, pictures, bricks, and plants were so authentic to Mexican culture (I say this from experience in different Mexican cities). The food was amazing and portion sizes were large. Still not quite sure why people are complaining about prices, they seem more then fair given the quality of food in such an amazing establishment.   But anyways, We went two nights in a row, the first night in the garden for a romantic evening. And our second night in town we wanted a little more upbeat tempo, so we tried a couple  local bars nearby (lazy dogs and one other) and ultimately ended up back at Pancho's in the bar area. I wouldn't suggest going into the bar unless you want a lively and active environment like we did on this night, the garden and dining will give you the relaxing experiencing you are looking for. We didn't make it in for happy hour at the bar but were told t's from 2:30-6:30- half off appetizers and margaritas. Not sure if that is all days or not.  Also the mentions comedy nights and karaoke nights but not sure which nights those are either.  In conclusion this place is spectacular and will definitely be our go to spot for future visits.",

    "text": "First off, if you are looking for the same michoacan garbage that is all over this city don't bother. This is Cali Mex, through and through. Fresh ingredients, clean flavors. Also, it's not cheap so if you're offended by a $19 plate of solid mexican food, go elsewhere. For some reason people will pay that for just about any other type of food here without thinking about it but when it comes to mexican food, they think it should be cheaper. I completely disagree but if that's your take, go hit Roberto's & eat half warm food out of a Styrofoam carton.  Salsa here is slightly chunky with great fresh flavor. You are not going to find runny \"hot sauce\" here. We both ordered the combination plates and there was not a single item that we didn't absolutely love. I especially enjoyed the cheese enchilada which almost had a creamy cheesy consistency & husband especially liked the beef tacos with shredded beef which were encased in a perfectly cooked corn shell, not too hard & not too soft. We also had a half-order of the guacamole which again was incredibly fresh tasting & didn't included a bunch of shredded lettuce at the bottom that many restaurants use as filler.   The service was incredible (shout out to Jason & his manager) and the interior was beautiful with lots of plant life. It gave the impression you were sitting in one of San Diego's great mexican restaurants.  It's completely refreshing to have an alternative to most of the other nuevo mex & michoacan you'll find in this city. We'll definitely be back!!!",

In the meal, the chicken was a bit off and the onions other veggies overcooked.  Rice and beans were rice and beans.  Great service by very nice server, but the inside was a bit underwhelming from what I was expecting and the way it was talked up.  Staff were sprinting (pounding) up and down stairs so not that relaxing and bar music was blaring.  Stairs took up most of the floor space.   Large portions but the price is high.  I think for the price and all the talk about the inside I was expecting more.  We may go back sometime.  Not bad, but not really great either.  Glad we tired it.",

    "text": "Wow!!! I like other reviewers wrote I wish I would have read the reviews before dining at this place. I will start out by saying that this is not to intend harm on Pancho's but there is a point to where a restaurant should offer soe sort of value to its patrons. This place doesn't. My actual rating would be about 1.5 star so I'm rounding it up.  The atmosphere: I've seen this place many times before and watched the construction. We decided to dine there on a Sunday for lunch. It's decor reminds me of something you would find near San Diego and the atmosphere is decent. But to me atmosphere doesn't make the place.  The food: My step-daughter and I ordered the chicken chimichanga which was about $18-19. Definitely pricey for lunch. At first glance I noticed it wasn't in the large side nor was it extremely small. The flavor was ok but the chicken was very dry. The rice and beans that came with the meal could be replaced with any other average rice and beans from another restaurant and I would not have noticed. My wife had the chili relleno. I asked her how hers was and she said she's had better. My daughter had a chicken quesadilla which was, get this, $17. Now, she said that it was really good. But this is coming from a 10 year old girl who thinks microwave popcorn is the bomb.   The service: Our waitress did definitely make herself seen. The bus person always filled our waters. But no was was overly friendly.  The Overall: I base a restaurant on whether I would visit it again. This one I would not. All-in-all the meal was under $80 and that is with all of us only ordering water. Really? $80 for lunch? Add in a tip and my bill total was over $92. I've definitely had better food and larger portions at local taco shops and spent less than a 1/3 of that for my entire family.  Sorry Pancho's but listen to your customers reviews. A lot of them are saying the exact same thing as I am. Even though most of those reviewers may not be back, you can protect future patrons. And only very few people decide to leave reviews. You have no idea how many people, who decide not to write their opinion that decide they will not come back because of the value.",

I had heard so much about this place with the wishing pond and picture area all was good but the food needs some work. I had the rolled tacos with sour cream (taquitios) and the meat was mixed with onion and meat sauce. I would have liked it simple no added sauce to the meat. It was nice to try something different but won't go back.",

    "text": "Well - I can see why this brand new restaurant only has 3 stars.  Ambiance - 5 stars Service - 2 stars Food Quality - 3 stars Price - 1 star  Unfortunately, ambiance doesn't a good meal make.  We walk in w/ a party of 8 on Sunday at 6pm.  The hostesses look at us, one rolls her eyes, then they ask if we have a reservation.  We didn't, but asked if they could accommodate us and they said it would  be a few minutes.  We walked into the bar area to get a drink while we waited.  The bartender was fantastic, I wanted a skinny margarita w/ no triple sec.  He made a delicious concoction with a grand marnier float and it was fabulous.  They call us up and ask my husband if we want the 18% auto-grat added.  He declined as if the service is good, we generally tip 20% or more.    They seat us up on the second level, which again, was beautiful.  We are greeted promptly by the server and bussers and we order additional non alcoholic drinks.  Not long after, we had some chips & salsa delivered to the table that were rather good.  We start looking through the menu and realize everything (and i mean EVERYTHING) is over priced.  $20 for Ceviche?  $15 for Guacamole?!? Are you kidding me???  Anyway, we were there w/ family so we decided to just deal.  My husband and I are vegan and noticed very few vegan options on the menu.  No big deal, we'll just modify.  They have a Vegetarian Salad (THIS IS WHAT THEY CALL IT) that includes the Mexican style rice.  Thing is - the Mexican style rice ISN'T vegetarian!! It's made w/ chicken stock!!!  Why would you put a non-vegetarian item in a vegetarian dish??  I am SO GLAD my gut told me to ask.  That being said, I ordered that salad, no rice, no cheese, no sour cream and it was actually rather good.  The dressing they put on it was great too and it was loaded w/ squash and carrots.  I did ask for beans since I wasn't getting the rice, cheese, and cream and they happily obliged.  However, this was a $17 salad.  My brother in law is pretty picky and ordered the philly burritto w/ o the onions or peppers - basically just meat and cheese.  My sister-in-law ordered the beef & beans burrito.  My bro in law's burrito came out w/ just meat.  My sister in law's came out chicken & beans, instead of beef & beans.  Neither came with ANY sides.  For $15 (it might have even been more), it should come with SOMETHING on the side.  My brother in law sent his burrito back and decided he would just wait to eat until he go thome instead of overpaying for the dish.  My sister in law ate hers, but said it was just \"meh\" - she could get better for a fraction of the price at Roberto's.  We had to ask for ketchup for my nephew's dish 3 times, and had to ask for the check twice (the second time almost 20 minutes after the first).  The manager came over and told my brother in law he wouldn't need to pay for the burrito (said it multiple times like it was some big favor he was doing us).  It was nice he stopped by, but that was a given - I sure hope we aren't paying for food that we sent back because it was deemed sub-par.  I ordered a second margarita, and started to explain to the server what I wanted but then stopped and said, you know what - the bartender will remember, he just made my first one.  The server smiled, shook his head, then walked away.  After I get my second margarita and it tastes NOTHING like the first, I see there's another bar upstairs.  He knew I came up w/ my first margarita...why didn't he ask me to continue because he would be ordering from a different bartender??  I'm just thoroughly disappointed, I really wanted to like this place and was excited about a late night bar (the bar is open until 2) that isn't a pub opening up in the area, however everything is way over priced (just because you're in Summerlin doesn't mean you can overcharge), the food was average and the service was subpar.  I will only likely return if invited for another group event.  It's a shame, because we could have been regulars.",

WE BECAME BORED. One and done. Chips and salsa were served, didn't like them. Bottom line if you want me to come back, give me a reason....With staff that understands the customer is what pays there salary and tips are the gravy.... and friendly goes a long way. Decor isn't enough. If you are tending bar, talk to your customers, make them feel welcome and WANT to come back.",

    "text": "Went to Pancho's on Saturday December 12th for the first time and sat in the bar area with my five girlfriends to celebrate a birthday. The first thing you should know is there is nothing on the menu that is less than $20.00 except for the taco salad that was $16.99 and a few appetizers that were $18.99. Now, I am not cheap and I don't mind paying for a good meal so I was expecting with these prices to have great food and great service to celebrate my friend's birthday. We were sadly disappointed.   The taco salad was pretty much just lettuce and sour cream with a few beans (not exaggerating - maybe 7 beans throughout) and a very small amount of ground beef at the bottom with a couple chips (again not exaggerating - probably 2 chips total). The Queso Fundido was tasteless. Oh and I could smell the Ceviche my friend ordered from 5 feet away- I was convinced she was going to get food poisoning from rotten fish. As it stands, I cannot guarantee she didn't - food poisoning and too much alcohol cause similar symptoms...   The food was not even the worst of it though...the service was horrible!  Our waitress Adriana/Ariana was terrible! She was so slow. Took 20 minutes just to get our first drinks and another 20 minutes to get some chips. Then the worst part of the entire night - THE BILL...(cue the horror music). The bill took 2 hours (again not exaggerating - we finished eating at 9pm and we were there until 11pm figuring out the damn bill). Why? Because Adriana/Ariana had apparently never rung up a bill in her life. From the 5 of us, she split the bill for 3 on one and 2 on another. I was on the bill with the 3. One of my friends on that bill payed in cash and the other two of us said to split the rest of the check. I'm sure you could see how this could go wrong - She could only charge one of us...she could not split it evenly...she could charge us for the completely separate bill for the other two girls at our table..wait! Yes! You read that right...she charged us EACH for the other bill at the table. So round and round we go for 2 damn hours. In the end,  I still show a pending charge on my bank account for $53.00 for my taco salad and a coke...when it should have been $26.00.   I know what you're thinking, you would have asked to speak with a manager and cleared the whole thing up - no need for this drama mama's review. But you would be wrong because I asked to see the manager TWICE and no manager ever came. In fact, no other waiter PRETENDING to be the manager even came (yes, I used to work in food service and this happened all the time). After two hours, I couldn't wait anymore and I wasn't going to make a scene and embarrass my girlfriend on her birthday so I left...  Please don't waste your money here, folks. It's too bad because the band was actually pretty good and the place is really beautiful (decor and such). Worst dining experience ever.",

    "text": "The absolute worst service I've ever experienced!  A group of about 20 people (farewell dinner) decided to eat here last minute. We figured we would just eat in the bar area, which wouldn't require a reservation. Everyone was extremely shocked by the price of all of the food. Heck, even the appetizers averaged at about $15. The margaritas were average with an above average price. The blended had large chunks of ice, on the rocks margaritas you could taste the triple sec (quite a few others in the party and myself are bartenders/servers) The server in the bar area, Ericka, wasn't TOO terrible until the end. Towards the end of the end of the night, someone asked for their check so they could leave. At that point Ericka said she wasn't splitting the check, but that she would bring out the entire group's check at that time. Someone mentioned that to me so I asked for Ericka to come and explain to me what was going on. She told me what she told the other person, that she was not splitting the check. Upon my constant asking of why this was, she then tried to say that she had talked to the first table there (the parents of the bride and groom) and that I was not there for the conversation, so I had no idea.   So after Ericka walked away, I went to ask the parents what she had asked or said at the beginning of the night. They told me that Ericka had asked how we were doing everything, and they told her a couple different times that it was all going to be split. So when Ericka came back out, and I asked her what exactly the first table had said. That's when her story changed and she said that they told her we were going to split the checks. So I asked her why we were not splitting them, and she responded with asking how I expected her to do such a thing. (I feel even someone with no food and beverage experience would know what to do to split checks among any size group) So when I said she could have written everything down according to check numbers in accordance to the guests eating/drinking each item, she tried ignoring me. After a few seconds go by of my looking at her with no response, she asked how to do that, and with my best efforts not to sound pampas or rude, I told her she could have written it all down. At that moment she laughed in my face and walked away. I requested a manager and was approached by one several minutes later. She apologized for the situation we were in, but then started questioning why we were there without a reservation, or without calling her ahead of time. (She claimed to be the events manager for the restaurant). I told her it was last minute and did not think a call or reservation was needed to sit in the bar area. She apologized one more time and said if we ever wanted to do a party or large dinner again to be sure to call and set it up with her. When she started walking away I said I wanted to talk to her about her server, Ericka. After explaining what happened, she said she would talk to her later on about it. In my opinion, she seemed to be brushing it off.   So after the manager leaves, I see Ericka just standing near the bar, not really doing much of anything. So I walk up to her asking what the plan was. She looked at me blankly and then asked if she was going to come figure out the checks so we could all leave. This is the point in the night that I was completely dumbfounded. She told me no, and then said that I could do it. After waiting a little bit for the shock to wear off of what she just said, I asked for some paper, and proceeded to go around the entire table, asking each person/couple what they got to eat and drink. I even wrote check numbers along with their names. So I go give her the paper, offer for any more assistance and she says no, and I go sit down. Several minutes go by and she walks up to me, hands me all of the split checks, says, \"Here you go.\", and walks away. Not only did I split the checks for her, she then expected me to pass them all out. to speed up the process I did so, just so we could pay and get out of there.   I have never in my life been treated so horribly by any sort of restaurant, not even fast food, and that says something. I will encourage everyone to NOT visit this place, unless you was mediocre food and beverages, and a ridiculous price.",

Yes, every dish is a few dollars more than most places off strip.    But The whole experience was great with the Mexican villa theme.  Coming here on cinqo de Mayo with a lovely date was a solid winner.  The ambiance was rich, bustling with butterfly chatter.  The dining crowd was really alive and had some good vibe and energy.  The servers were super attentive and came by multiple times to check on our drinks, food etc.  the food?  The beef fajitas were tender.  I'm feeling they used at least a ny steak cut or better.  The lobster enchiladas were good too, lots of lobster.  First time seeing lobster served in an enchilada and it was a pleasant surprise.   The atmosphere and food definitely makes up for the price.  Having just been to Wolfgang pucks last night, this was 3 times better.",

I've been here twice for happy hour in the cantina, the margaritas are ok, strong but taste just like your typical premix-made margarita, the appetizers are good, a little overpriced for a HH special but oh well. The bartender was nice and attentive. I haven't had any problems with my food or drinks so far.  I like that they have live music, except I wish it was mariachi or Spanish music at least, which you'd think they would play, instead its an \"Ed Sheeran\" playing covers of Alanis Morresette. But they're trying to support local artists so ok. Still not a bad spot to wind down for an hour or two.",

They need to lower the price of all menu items by no less than $5.   Service: We sat at the table for at least 10 minutes before our waiter even came over to introduce himself and he didn't even do that. The first words were \"are you ready to order?\" When it was time to leave, it took another 10 minutes just for him to bring the check, after the table was cleared.   Food: Not only is it bad enough the food was overpriced, my father and I got sick the next day as well. We shared the chicken and shrimp fajitas and had explosive experiences in the bathroom the following morning. Speaking of the fajitas, it was 75% veggies and a little bit of meat. They even left the shells on the shrimp! So they had to be eaten individually instead of as part of the fajitas.   Myself and my family will never return to this establishment. There are MANY other Mexican restaurants with better food, better service, and better prices all across Vegas. Huge disappointment.",

The restaurant is so cute and festive inside. I enjoy that the music was kept to the bar area and it was tasteful and not super loud in the main restaraunt. Service us alright, I expect a little more when you are paying these prices for food, but it wasnt bad. The second time we came here, we had the worst table, all the way in the back corner, it was hot and loud, we asked if we could move and they were very accommodating. This low review is mainly for the price. Enchilada sauce is alright, not the best. Panchos nachos were delish, quesadillas were nothing special. And the fried ice cream was a big disappointment. The outer exterior was hard and chewy and not at all like fried ice creams I've had before. Totally a bummer. I'm ok with paying these type of prices at a place like javiers because their food is amazing, panchos was just alright.",

Service was decent, food was not very flavorful and very over priced for the quality of food. $25 for Rajitas (their version of fajitas), $20 for a carne asada burrito and $10 for a kids meal of a quesadilla, rice and beans. All in all we spent $100 for four of us. I was too nice to not get up and walk out when I saw the prices but know I don't anticipate going back for food.

Ok , well they must have AMAZING FOOD ! Unfortunately, it's all very far from . I had never Heard my husband complain about too much cheese on his nachos before but there was a ridiculous amount ! My taco salad could not have been anymore tasteless ! It's bad when you can't decipher between sour cream , guacamole, chicken , and balsamic dressing ! I mean the flavor was 100% missing ! You could clearly tell we weren't happy with our food . All I did was mix mine around , take a couple tasteless bites , and push it away . We weren't asked if our food was ok .. they acted like it was normal to pick up a table full of plates with 90% of the food untouched . This was not in any kind of way a $110 meal for 2 adults , a teenager , and 2 toddlers . My husband asked me who has a better Taco salad and my response was TACO BELL ! That's pretty sad :(",

If you are tempted they constantly have 2 for 1 specials every day.    Please put a great restaurant in this place!!!",

    "text": "So after many past debates on coming into Panchos, we decided to visit today on National Margarita Day during happy hour. Since their opening, we've heard the same reviews (and Yelp reviews confirm the rumors) that the food is yummy but very overpriced. We heard the best time to go is during Happy Hour so we finally decided to check them out during their Happy Hour. Quickly into our visit, we immediately agreed the prices were very high, including happy hour. The ambiance is awesome and makes you feel like you're not in Vegas but the prices remind you that you haven't left the city, even with the happy hour prices.  We sat at the bar and the service was great from bartender, manager and food runner but ugh that doesn't compensate the high menu prices. Mexican food is affordably reasonable but $15 for guacamole??? I couldn't convince myself to pay that price. My bf ordered the Wahoos tacos ($19, 2 tacos with rice & beans) but that was his only meal for the day so he splurged. He said they were yummy but expensive.    Also their menu is very long. You feel like you're reading a book when browsing through the options which immediately turned me off. Honestly it took me a bit to find the guacamole b/c I was scamming the menu looking for it and it blended right into the other menu items.  Great ambiance but high prices to pay for it",

The happy hour is only at the bar area, not for the rest of the patrons, weird rule.    Prices are ridiculous for what you get. Food was okay, but not great, and at that price point you expect great.  Other places in town have better food, better service, and better prices.  I will not come back.",

My boyfriend and I are at Poncho's quite often..... maybe more offers that we should be. ;) We love sitting at the bar, the bartender's are great! We always start with a house margarita- one with salt for my boyfriend and one with tajin for me, the chips are always warm and the salsa is great! Depending on our appetite and mood we will either share the steak fajitas which we always request medium rare and comes with tortillas and all the sides or a three item combo with a chicken taco, and two cheese enchiladas. The entrees are good sized, so depending on your appetite may be worth sharing.  They also have a happy hour daily and taco Tuesdays! I highly recommend Poncho's!",

There are observed scenes of vegetation all around with beautiful lights and it feels like you are outside in a beautiful courtyard. The food is delicious! We ordered the chicken enchiladas which were fantastic. The nachos they start you off with were fresh and it is obvious that they are housemaid with delicious salsa.  The margaritas are outstanding and we did order frozen ones which were really good! The service is very friendly and also fast. They are efficient and we really like that. The prices are more than reasonable and it was very affordable. The menu is vast with many different choices of delicious Mexican food. I will say that my friend who was there with me is from Mexico and she was thoroughly impressed. Highly recommended and we will definitely be coming back.",

The Chimichanga Especial is crispy and delicious. The pork melts in your mouth. It comes with enough rice and beans to feed at least another person (did I mention the enormous portions?).

How can Mexican food lack flavor!!?? Plus it's overpriced.  Big disappointment.    We do continue to patronize the cantina to enjoy the performances. The drinks are pricy but good.

It's almost like paying Strip prices!! All entrees are approx $15+.  Now, I get it....Mexican food is often marginalized and placed in the \"cheap food\" category, like most Chinese restaurants outside of the Strip and Chinatown.  If you're looking for a really great/fancy Mexican meal, you should probably be charged for it. But I argue that the price here does not match the food that is provided.  I ordered a chicken & mango salad and it was $18.  The salad was good, but not $18 good.  The salad portion was like the boxed greens from costco, and the mango was not very ripe. Chicken was juicy and had some great umami flavoring, but not overly impressed with the salad as a whole.  My friend ordered the fish tacos, which came in a cook fish-shaped plate! Also $18, and likewise not worth the price.   Ultimately, Pancho's is a fun and festive restaurant but it's catering to the wrong crowd. If you have a cartoon character wearing a sombrero as your sign, you prob shouldn't be charging up to $20 for a meal.  Just sayin'.   Would def recommend for a fun date night or bday.  Service was friendly, but not the most efficient.",

Walking inside the venue is bright with windows on the ceiling. There are large plants and a water fountain as a center piece. You feel as if you are sitting outside on a patio without any bugs or bad weather to ruin your dining experience.  We ordered a chicken chimmichamga and ranchero enchiladas and added chicken. Hands down the best enchiladas I've ever tasted. Prices are a little higher but the portion sizes make up for it. You are paying for quality and quantity. All the flavors were extraordinary. Their salsa had great flavor with a hint of heat, their coffee and iced tea tasted fresh and I couldn't stop myself from finishing my lunch even after I was full. Servers and hosts were nice and welcoming. We never needed anything and the service team works together to make sure the guest is satisfied.  This was my first visit here and will not be my last. I'm so happy we came in and tried a new Mexican restaurant from the norm. They offer different events on different days including taco Tuesday, live music, ect.",

I had the artichoke avocado enchiladas - superb. Black beans are wow! Don't order the rice as it has chicken stock in it (if you are vegetarian). We got treated like we are in a five-star restaurant. Margaritas excellent- we got the Cadillac margarita. Beer on tap - top notch! For \"checking in\" we are getting free fried ice cream and are following it with a Bailey's and coffee. We have about five restaurants that we cycle & we have just added this one to our list. I consider us very picky and all three of us loved this dinner! We are foodies in our DNA!",

Too many tables in bar area, and I wonder if they cut corners with this place. I saw a guy fall out of the bar stool because the top broke off. Kinda scared me because the stools make you sit high. And because of all the tables and stools it looked like he landed into some of the stuff. Over crowded. They had many tvs playing all kinds of sports. Kinda quiet. Wish I had sat inside, it looked much more beautiful, and then maybe up stairs would be great.",

Their fajitas are ok, the meat is very tender and has a different flavor, however there wasn't much of it. Tried the cake for dessert and it was a very large portion that tasted OK. I've never had Tres Leches cake before so I can't compare it to anything, but I probably wouldn't order it again.   There was no drink menu on the table which I thought was kind of odd. Two managers (I think they were Managers) came to the table more than once and interrupted us. I appreciate their concern, but more than 3 times of checking on us is a bit excessive - let the servers do their job!   I agree with other reviews regarding their price point, it is a bit high and I'm not sure why -- Nothing about the food was special and IMO being in Summerlin is not a good reason. Although we didn't explore the menu at all and stuck with a boring dish such as fajitas, we probably won't go back.",

The chicken tamale, however, was not as good; it had large chunks of chicken breast which were dry and not especially flavorful.  I normally steer clear of chicken dishes in a Mexican restaurant, but that was the only kind of tamale they served and I had a hankering for a tamale.  My mistake.  The guacamole was plentiful and tasty, but with just a bit too much lime juice.  The salsa had way too much cilantro for my taste.  But the prices were reasonable, and the decor was pleasant.  The service was okay.  Our waiter was sometimes a little difficult to find, and there is more to friendly service than simply addressing the table as \"mi amigos,\" but I really wasn't expecting the level of service at Le Cirque, so it was fine.  If I lived in Summerlin, I would go back to Pancho's.  But since it is a bit of a schlep from Spring Valley, I'll probably stick to places closer to home.  A truly good Mexican restaurant is tasty, cheap, and right around the corner.",

I have had better chicken quesadillas and my husband was disappointed that his food was bland tasting. I appreciated the manager checking in on us after we received our food. I love how most of the restaurants do that, like at Olive Garden and even at Cane's chicken. I checked in on Yelp and received a free fried ice cream which they only allow one per table. after waiting quite sometime for the check I had to get up and ask the lady at the front to get our waiter.

Shrimp fajitas around $26 and if you want a combination of shrimp and chicken then shuck out $31. And that doesn't include a drink, tax  and tip. Around $40 for fajitas that were awful. I'm not a huge fan of Baja Fresh but even their fajitas taste better. This is a huge problem. I'll go to Lindo Michoacan any day over Pancho's.

The ambiance is top notch, but the buck- I'd say it stopped there, but when you scan the menu... you'll see they've passed the buck onto you. For example a taco plate is $22.- for tacos! Not Kobe beef tacos- just regular tacos.  I ordered a Titos Cosmo, it was served in a tiny martini glass with a teaspoon of Titos in it. It was more like receiving a communal sip of juice. Hardly enough to flush away this girls sins. The mahi ceviche was a 6.5 out of 10, and my a la carte  cheese enchilada was a disastrous, wet mess. My girlfriend ordered a simple cheese quesadilla which she found most palatable- at the tune of $17 (or more), I tried to verify this by looking the price up on their Internet menu, but... they don't show the prices on the Internet, curiously supportive of my claim that you're about to be gouged for food that you're likely to be disappointed with.  The live band that was playing in the bar area was remarkable. The foliage and finely detailed surroundings are unlike any local restaurant. Due to the uniquely executed ambiance their rent must be extraordinary, unfortunately their food is not.",

I will give second shot as everything else was good.",

    "text": "I have gotten to love this place. When they first opened, the wait was too long and I didn't find the quality of food and drinks to be worth the prices that are considered by some on the high-end for Mexican. When you consider what you're getting, it's not really overpriced. It's authentic style Mexican. So if you're looking for Chiles style cheaper meals, you won't like it here. The atmosphere is great, the service is spectacular and the margaritas are divine. We get the \"special\" margaritas with the extra Grand Marnier on top. The guacamole is delicious. I usually get fajitas, but this last visit, I ordered the steak quesadilla and split it with my daughter. It was also delicious. My husband usually orders something the waiter recommends and is always pleased. To our surprise, our waiter remembered what my husband had ordered a month prior and asked if he'd like the same or to try something else. This is what sealed the deal for us. When the wait staff is this attentive, management is as well and the entire restaurant reflects these attitudes. Towards the end of the meal, the manager stopped by and was super friendly and just like our waiter, seemed to enjoy his job. He asked for some feedback, and I shared with him how the word around town (or at least amongst our friends) is that they are overpriced. He asked what I thought, and I explained how after this visit, I have come to realize you pay for what you get. I further explained about the atmosphere, food and drink quality and staff are what we are also paying for. He appreciated our comments and bought us a round of shots. Now that is how I like to be treated! And I do love their Margaritas.",

He didn't even ask if we wanted to order dessert.  Our dishes took forever too.  We were seated upstairs where it was dark as a cave...Probably so that we wouldn't be able to see our food.  My enchiladas were flavorless and my rice was hard.  I gave the one star for the cute decor.  I don't recommend this place.  Taco Bell is higher quality.  I bet the rent is expensive in DT Summerlin, but that doesn't justify $70 for 2 TV dinners:(",

The guacamole alone here is $14.95. Insane! The salsa was not good either, it was too spicy (and I love heat!) and bland. That being said, my friend ordered a kiwi margarita (which is mysteriously priced at a reasonable $10.95) and it was one of the best I have ever tasted. There was also live music in the bar area and the band playing was fantastic. There were fliers up saying that have comedy and karaoke as well. All in all I say come for the drinks and entertainment but skip the food.",

    "text": "I just don't see how this place is going to last.  The prices are just too high for the quality of food provided. The only reason I went was because of the happy hour half off appetizers and discounted drinks.     The chips were cold and seemed like the type of cheap chips you'd get at a grocery store.   And the salsa was completely uninspiring -- typical boring, tasteless, spiceless garden salsa that could've easily come from a grocery store bottle.  I asked if they had a hotter, habanero type salsa -- and was provided with habanero Tabasco sauce (I like Tabasco sauce, but not exactly what I was looking for)  Tried the naughty maggie Margarita.   Found it to be no more interesting than a standard Margarita.   My main dish was the queso fundido appetizer (it was just me, so the large appetizer was a full meal).  Well, it looked nothing like what I'm used to seeing with queso fundido at other Mexican restaurants.... looked more like a plate of sour cream. Flavor was okay but not something I would order again. .. and had I paid the usual full $16 price for this appetizer, I would've been very disappointed...instead of just moderately disappointed.    When the check arrived,  the happy hour discount amount for what I ordered was incorrect so that had to be fixed.  But it actually couldn't be fixed and instead I had to be given an additional dollar off (so double check the pricing for those going for the happy hours deals).  And I was charged the full price on the Margarita because apparently that was not part of the happy hour special discounted drinks (something that was not clearly explained by my waitress when I ordered.... even though I had expressly asked her about the drink specials just before I ordered it -- so she clearly knew where my head was at and allowed me to order the non-discounted drink instead ..... a little bit deceptive if you ask me).    I'm sorry to say but there is just nothing good to report about this place. I hope the restaurant that takes over this place after they inevitably close does a complete overhaul.   I had high hopes for this place,  but having gotten a small bad taste, there is simply no reason for me to ever come back and try anything else.  If Yelp allowed for zero stars, that would've been my rating.  Would someone please message me and tell me where I can get some decent very spicy, but smooth salsa in this city!!  Is that too much to ask for?",

Got drinks pretty quickly and service was excellent. On to the food. Chips and salsa were typical. Salsa was soupy with small chunks of tomato. Had a little spicy flavor to it but it was not unbearable. Had wahoo fish tacos and cheese enchiladas for entrees. Fish was flavorful and came with  a creamy sauce to garnish the tacos. Cheese enchiladas were very good and better than most Mexican restaurants. Beans and rice were good but when food was delivered the beans and rice were warm and not hot. A little disappointed the hot meal ordered was not hot. The worst part of the night was when the bill came. The prices here are extremely high and not worth it.",

I won't judge the service too much since it's always crazy during the opening, although I'm not sure why waiters always feel comfortable complaining about their day and other customers to me (this happens at many restaurants, not just this one).  Pancho's is basically a '90s throwback Mexican restaurant with Americanized Mexican food, which isn't a bad thing. The obsession with authenticity has made me miss this stuff, but I can't imagine the reviewers who are calling this authentic have ever been outside their all-inclusive in Cancun.  We ordered an appetizer platter, which was about $18, and while it was big, it would've been cheaper at any other Mexican restaurant. The quesadillas were great, and the rest was standard. My husband got the steak fajitas, and this was the tiniest serving of fajitas I've ever seen, but he said the steak was excellent. I got the Pancho's trio of enchiladas, and they were your usual enchiladas, both in size and flavor.  We thought about ordering the $16 guacamole, but the waiter said we can try the side portion that comes with our appetizer platter. It's pretty much just mashed up avocado. No flavor whatsoever, and they charge more than any place I've ever been to, including those on the Strip.  All the food was good but in no way justifies the fact that they charge twice as much as every other Mexican restaurant. This is probably the most expensive Mexican place I've seen, and there was absolutely nothing special about the food. They'll need to cut the prices by nearly half to keep a regular clientele. We spent $67 on those three items, and went to Casa Don Juan the next week and got the same stuff for $28, and it tasted much better.  Another problem was that there were little kids running around all over the place. None of them were with the same party, but for whatever reason, everyone felt comfortable letting their kids run around in circles in a packed restaurant full of rushing waiters. It's common to see someone who doesn't care what their kid is doing, but it's just weird when it's a room full of careless parents.  The waiter said seafood is their specialty, so I'll go back to try it and see if it's any better than the rest. Unlike what the last reviewer said, we are not cheap. We regularly eat at restaurants that are more expensive than this, but the quality matches the price at those places. Pancho's just doesn't do it. I figure this restaurant will attract the same flavorless Summerlin soccer mom crowd as Crave.",

It is obvious they have invested a lot of money, which they are trying to recover with their ridiculous menu prices. I had the Camerones diablo, which was 25.00 for four shrimp floating in a bed of oil. I did not enjoy it at all. The views from the others dining with me were mixed on their food, but all agreed, too pricy. The service was excellent-very attentive, but does not make up for extremely expensive mediocre food.",

The mini pizza was the size of a bagel bite. Not great for a 9 year old. The food was so bland you could barely taste it. Took 15 minutes to get soda and another 10 minutes to get a glass of water. The staff was nice but that's where the \"good\" ended. The menu showed that kids meals included drinks but when the check came we were charged $3.25 for 3 kids drinks. When I asked about it, 6 people told me they weren't sure if we were supposed to be charged. Really? We definitely won't be going back there. SO NOT WORTH IT!",

    "text": "Went there last night. My girlfriend was on a knee scooter with a cast on her foot.  We also had an elderly couple with us. The hostess takes us upstairs to our table. They aren't very observant. Maybe she should have asked if everyone in the party can get up the stairs...it would be a novel idea to offer the elevator. Waitresses and hostesses are plenty nice.   Manager came by and asked how the queso fundido was. We said it could use a little more spice. Then suggested maybe a spicy one and a not spicy one for the menu. Manager cracked a stupid sarcastic joke that maybe the restaurant could be half Chinese and half Mexican. He acted and looked like a clown. He was a jerk off.  I ordered the Carne Asada, the GF ordered the seafood chimichanga. The old folks ordered a combo dinner and a beef chimichanga. The Carne Asada they serve is a hunk of sirloin. It is tough and chewy. Authentic Carne Asada dishes are usually made with skirt steak.   Girlfriend loved her seafood chimi. Heard no complaints from the olds regarding their food.  Bartender in the Bar was pleasant and helpful while we waited and the three waitresses were fun to talk to.  We ordered no alcohol with our dinner and the bill was well over $100.00   The girlfriend said she prefers Robertos Taco Shop for tastiness of food and price. I agree with her.  Funny thing is that I have been to Panchos on Rosecrans 100s of times for over 30 years. I remember the food being better and the price not as expensive there.  I was disappointed over all.",

The prices were so much more than all the other happy hours in town that we decided to split an order of $17 FAJITAS on regular menu.  I wanted a margarita but my only choice was $7.50 so I opted for a $5.00 Negro Modelo.   The chips and salsa were very good and so were the nicely charred chicken fajitas, an ample portion.  The best part of our experience was our very competent & personable server Claudia who belongs in a 5 star restaurant.  We also appreciated the ambiance and the fact that their TV screens are terrific & well situated for watching a game.  With the huge population of Mexican restaurants in our city, as well as happy hours at almost any restaurant, Pancho's has much competition.  They could begin by dropping the prices and changing the music.  We're waiting (way too long) for this town to come out of the clouds & take advantage of fine music for ALL generations.  Let's begin to EDUCATE, think outside the box, & not do \"business as usual.\"",

    "text": "So this my deal with Panchos.  Our food was delicious. Everyone enjoyed the meal. Salsa was quite delicious. But, and it's a big deal, it's just too pricey. Everything was priced like a restaurant in one of the top Strip hotels. $7.50 for a Mexican draft beer. About $20 for a carne asada chimichanga. $23 for a marinated pork dish. Everything tastes great and the service was on point. But $130 for four entrees, two sodas and four beers is just way too expensive for a standalone Mexican restaurant, even in Summerlin. They need to rethink their pricing in my opinion, if they want to be around as long as Lindo Michiocan or Frank & Finas.  Just too expensive to rate higher than 3 stars.",

Not only was the plate obviously left sitting under the warmer too long as the food all had a crust on top and the cheese from the enchilada was oozing out with barely any left inside, the rellano was burnt on the outside and the inside was hard like play doh, the rice was crispy not soft and moist. In addition to that the only solution they offered was for me to get a new plate (no time for that) or order something else. At least the taco was good. I find it's too expensive and service is not great. After today we will go elsewhere.",

The prices reflect the venue but definitely not the food or service.   Chips needed salt. Took forever to get more salsa.  Had to have the manager go ask someone to get it.   Had the mole enchilada...no good rich mole flavor. More like a bland and somewhat gritty sauce.   Used the yelp offer for free fried ice cream. This was not fresh, probably one of a batch from early in the day or say before. Ice cream was hard frozen and icy in the middle and the cornflakes were chewy.   Overall, for as well known as this place is in SoCal, this Vegas location needs help. The lack of crowds is showing it.",

I finally went to lunch here the other day to find out what it was all about. Walking in the place was amazingly beautiful. Spanish mission style with a little tropical flair. It is huge with an upstairs area for parties. We sat down immediately and the people were friendly. We ordered pretty much right away and the food came out very quickly. I took my first bite and immediately knew I could not finish this dish. The waitress came by to check on us and I asked her I had to send it back and order something else. I NEVER do this. Ever. That's how awful it was. My second dish was much more palatable but far from the best I've ever had. If this restaurant could fix their food, it would be such an amazing place to eat and drink. My advice would be to add more flavor and not over cook the meat beyond recognition. Also, maybe a avoid letting the sides make the main dish soggy. We were also served chips and salsa without dishes to eat it over.",

    "text": "Last minute decision, to have dinner here. Yelp rating on this spot could be misleading. It clearly is way out - 3 stars really -- Panchos is closer to 4.5 - 5 stars.  Our experience was 100% five stars  As you enter this restaurant, you are transported to wealthy Mexican house - wow what a foyer - decorated with classic Mexican art  We were quickly seated, table for two, the restaurant was packed, we got the last two seater. Within seconds we were attended by, one of best server experiences we have had in Las Vegas, Lee. We are new to Mexican cuisine, a fact, we shared with Lee to - right away we were give a full introduction to the highlights of the cuisine and based on our taste preferences what we should try. A prudent way to introduce you to cuisine you know little about.   So for appetizers, we were served a guacamole and hop spicy dip along with Corn chips. That went really well with us, and we waited probably 5-7 mins for our entree. My wife and me shared a entree - it was Grilled Chicken, salad, rice and beans. It is a big meal   The Chicken was really delicious, very well grilled with back ended BBQ flavor. Done just right.My wife enjoyed the bean and rice, I was not a huge fan. But overall the meal was very good, full marks to the chef.   After the Entree, we were offered Fried Ice Cream, to me that was good - not amazing like the  Entree and Appetizer. You can get this free with your Yelp Check-in   What really deserves 5 stars was the Service, Lee the server was amazing, the Manager dropped in - was polite and genuinely wants to look after his guests, there is warm feeling at Panchos - they want you to enjoy your meal - like being in their house.   Highly recommend this location for party or date night.  One word of caution, book ahead - it was busy when we were there, last Friday.",

The menu looks good but nothing stood out. I get the vibe of just another tired Mexican spot. Trouble is pricing makes you think it's fancy (hint, it's not). The food was good but not on par with the cost. I'm a guy who doesn't mind paying more if there is value but I left feeling shorted.   Add to that, service was pretty bad. Not like the waiter groped my date bad but still. We were sat and promptly forgotten. The busser came by after our waiter was a ghost for 10 minutes and grabbed our drinks. Took a while to get them and had to ask for chips and salsa. Yet another delay. Our waiter finally showed up with no personality and we never saw him again.   I'd say bring the price in line with what you get or step up the cuisine. Only time I would recommend the spot is just to check it out. After that, there are better options.",

From the minute we walked in, it felt as though we had been transported to some beautiful California coastal spot.  The food was amazing and the service was awesome! We got to meet one of the managers named Doug and he was such a blast to talk to!   Pros:   - the ambiance was incredible, felt like you were in a coastal home enjoying a home cooked meal.  - the food was delicious. I come from a family that cooks Mexican food almost every meal and it was fresh, tasty, and beautifully plated.  - the servers were quick on refills of drinks, chips, and salsas. Super friendly and accommodating.   - Doug was so friendly and really made us feel at home. We are coming back specifically because of him!  - the live music was just loud enough to hear, but never overwhelming.   - all in all, such a great experience. I can't say enough about how much I enjoyed this place! I have already recommended it to everyone I work with.   Cons:   - my only con is that they close pretty early. I felt guilty still eating almost half an hour after they closed.  I hope nothing but the best for this place, and I will be back again VERY soon!!",

The servers were very friendly and accommodating but not a big fan of the receptionist. She sat us in a very isolated area. We asked if we can sit in one of the free tables in the main dining area but she said there's no more available table. There were clearly at least 3 tables that are free. We asked a waitress if we could move and she gladly said yes!   Btw, they had a band entertaining the guests which is pretty cool. It's a decent mexican place but not coming back anytime soon.",

I knew I was gonna be in the area for shopping, and I knew that part of the name was Pancho's, and when I looked on yelp I thought I was going to the place that I had bookmarked. I don't know how I made such a mistake but what brought me to the supposed restaurant were the pictures, the vegan menu options and such. Nope this was not it! and I didn't realize my mistake until after we placed our order, and was wondering why there was only a breakfast menu and a dinner menu. I thought, 'oh, it must be the weekend so there is no lunch menu'. So I looked on yelp again, and saw the actual menus which didn't look nowhere near the ones I just looked at. oh well..  Anyway, it was too late to leave even though while looking at the menu I realized it was a little pricey for Mexican food. I felt like maybe it was because the area we were in? I'm not totally sure but what we ordered was one taco and cheese enchilada combo, which comes with rice and refried beans,  and the divorced eggs, which is a beef enchilada sandwiched between two over medium eggs, and rice and black beans. I never heard of divorced eggs entrees and I thought if we gonna spend a little more try something new. I liked how the refried beans came out with cheese on top and looks like it was broiled.   It was ok, nothing special. I was a little disappointed in myself for making such a mistake. I don't like to pay for expensive mexican food that's just standard. There are too many other places around, such as Roberto's taco shop that I am quite fine with.   The restaurant itself had nice decor, with a bar area and an upstairs. The hostesses, bussers and waiters are nicely dressed. The service is definitely good.   the bill diet coke  $3.75 Huevos Divorciados $17.95 #1 combo $18.95  Lesson learned...Yelp more carefully!",

UNTIL, we came to Pancho's. We could not stop raving about the quality and food and the service. Every few mins, we had different servers coming by our table offering to refill our waters, salsas, and asking if everything was okay. One waiter even saw my husband scanning the room for the bathroom, stopped whatever he was doing, and came up to ask if there was something he needed. We are beyond blown away by the service of this place and will definitely be returning.",

It's a large restaurant w/ample seating and separate bar/happy hour etc. the salsa is decent but also kind of spicy wish they had some options. We got fajitas, meat had a unique flavor wasn't a big fan but I got steak quesadillas and it had a better taste. Got an extra side of pico, so I'd go back. Liked how they give you glass of soda/pink lemonade and leave u with a mini pitcher so you can refill your own. Nothing like dying of thirst waiting for a waiter to refill your drinks! *Today I Got quesadilla con carne asada and so many of the steak pieces were so inedible bc it was full of gristle  I couldn't eat 1/2 of it. Disappointing. Salsa is decent sort of runny but chips were good.",

This is a review solely for the Cantina/bar area of Pancho's.  My boyfriend and I arrived about 15 minutes before the game started. You just help yourself to a seat and the staff will come around eventually. We were given waters and chips and salsa while we mused over the menu. I know the happy hour menu pictures on Yelp say that food is not included for weekends, but the waitress told us that food was included.   We ordered the queso fundido and chicken quesadilla. The queso fundido was way too heavy for me -- even with the occasional artichoke in the dip, I felt like it was just cheesy monotony. It was not very exciting and I ended up having to alternate dips between the salsa and the queso. The quesadilla was tasty, and we gobbled that up pretty quickly. But you can't really mess up a quesadilla. We also ordered the house margarita. Boyyyy, it is strong. It was tasty but definitely strong.  Waitress had the perfect balance of attentiveness. She knew that we were watching the game, so she would come during commercial breaks or time outs to check up on us.   2 dishes, 3 beers, 1 house margarita added up to be about $50 included tax and tip. That's pretty steep for happy hour.... I'm definitely coming back because it's a Rams bar, but I think next time I will just order drinks and eat their chips/salsa. The HH food is not special at all.  3 stars. +1 star for airing Rams games when the rest of Vegas is so focused on the Raiders.",

The food is delicious (highly recommend the Salmon,  it's perfectly cooked with great seasoning), the staff is patient and attentive as well as quick. Food came out quickly as well. Our server was Jose (both  times!) and he's great at what he does. Would consistently check on us for drink refills and to see if we liked our meals. Management  also checked in on us several times throughout our meal. Young man assisting our waiter also checked on us several times and asked if we needed take out containers before we even had to request them. Overall, outstanding food, service, and experience!!!  Highly recommend this place! Fun environment for kids as well.",

Overall the food was good but we were disappointed that they did not serve beans with the chips and salsa, no soup with the entrees and no horchata or any of the traditional Mexican drinks (they had margaritas and beer). It came short compared to our long time favorite Mexican restaurant but I would eat here again if the BOGO coupons keep coming, plus the free dessert for checking in thru Yelp :)",

We normally eat at frijoles or frank and Fina's for Mexican. I had the wahoo fish tacos and the fish was dry and not flavorful.  There was a sauce to put on it but it had a skin on top of it because it had been sitting so long and the beans were almost cold. The best thing we ate everyone agreed was the fries with the chicken strips my daughter got. The chicken pipian received a frown from my husband the shrimp tacos were again just OK. The cheese appetizer had cream cheese in it? The taquitos were OK. The service was good it was loud and my husband says the beer was good. I could imagine going to try happy hour maybe that would be a better experience but with the coupon the bill was 130 before tip. I don't mind paying but not when I leave hungry because the food was almost inedible.",

    "text": "So today I experienced Pancho's for the first time. I walked in with our party and was treated to live guitar music from the bar area stage. Nice way to set the mood. Short wait then our party of 16 was seated. Chips were average, while warm, still tasted commercial grade not fresh. Salsa was meh, no heat at all. Once again, commercial grade. But the wait staff did replenish them in a timely fashion. I ordered a Blue Ribbon Margarita. It came out in a basic margarita glass you find in any Mexican restaurant, salt on the rim etc, plenty of ice. Took a sip and it was room temp.. If a margarita is on the rocks, shouldn't it be shaken? I decided to let it chill, so it could chill. The margarita was like the glass, basic. As I looked at the menu the Enchiladas de Langosta (Lobster) stuck out to me. Seemed like a winner so I ordered it. Salad came first with the Pancho's vinaigrette, nothing special, red and green leaf lettuce, tomatoes, and chickpeas (I believe). Nothing spectacular, middle of the road as far as salads go. We didn't have to wait terribly long for our food to come out even at peak time (6 p.m.). My entree came out a fish shaped plate... different but I guess it distinguishes seafood entrees. Took a bite of the \"special\" green rice first, undercooked and bland. Then took a bite of my enchilada, tasted ok as did the black beans. Took another bite with the sour cream, and guac. Took a third bite with the sour cream and guac where I could really distinguish the lobster. After this bite I took a long pause, I could feel a slight wave of nausea wash over me. I was puzzled as to why this was happening. I sat for a second to see if the feeling would pass, it didn't. I asked a waiter for the restroom and proceeded there. Handicap stall, in use, regular stall FILTHY, and added to my nausea. Waited a few min for the feeling to pass, went back to my table. I sat back down after a few minutes and engaged in casual conversation. I decided to try my meal again. This time I scraped off the sour cream and guac and dug through the enchilada to just get a piece of lobster by itself. 1-2 minutes after I ingested it, I got felt that familiar uneasiness from my stomach. Im convinced the lobster or the sour cream was the culprit. I gave up on my meal and ordered a Sprite. The Sprite helped somewhat but I still felt uneasy and ventured again to the restroom. Light was off when I entered, regular stall, still FILTHY. The handicap stall was still locked and I then realized that it was not in use the first time, but locked from the inside. I assume this was for a reason and cringed at the potential horrors it could have contained. I sweated it out for a few minutes at the sink, and was able to keep my composure. At this point I gave up on Pancho's, and decided for my gastro intestinal well being to cut my losses. I texted a coworker to let my boss know I was leaving as I wasn't feeling well. I drove home swiftly, immediately grabbed a ginger ale to settle my stomach and aid me in completing this review while the memory was still fresh, which is more than I can say for my meal. Pancho's.. First time, last time, no time. There are better options out there.",

This was not our first or even second visit, we have become regulars. The salads, especially the crab and shrimp salad are awesome. The tacos, burritos, etc are all tastey. We try at least one new item each time we go, but always love the chips, salsa and guac. The salsa is the best in Las Vegas, fresh with just the right amount of citrus and heat.   The prices are very reasonable. And the staff are always friendly and attentative to all your glasses being refilled, to chip refills etc.   Another amazing item we can't get over watching, and is a must see... there is a long staircase to the upper level on which wait staff run up and down with fully loaded trays of food. The first time there we thought for sure someone was going to face plant down the stairs but these guys have confidence and move up and down without fear of falling. I would have face planted if I tried running the stairs,  so I know my place is at a table with a bar drink and yummy salsa and chips.",

She was busy with several tables but checked on  our satisfaction and drink refills several times. She definitely was interested in providing great service. The Cadillac Margaritas were excellent and comparably priced.  The complementary chips and salsa were very good. Tasty salsa with large pieces of tomato.  Shrimp Diabla Puffy Tacos consist of two flour tortillas filled with shrimp sauteed in a mild Diabla Sauce topped with shredded cabbage and chipotle.  On the side were re-fried beans, rice, salsa and guacamole. This was a very tasty taco with plenty of shrimp.  The bean burrito was large enough for two people.   More competition in Mexican food has arrived in Summerlin and now provides several choices. Pancho's appears to have the edge on decor but not price.",

    "text": "Mediocre food and service and completely overpriced.    My husband, daughter and myself were in the DTS area and decided to have dinner.  Wanting Mexican, we decided to try it out.    We were given a lackluster greeting by a young girl who clearly was bored and taken through the dining room to our seat. We were promptly given chips and salsa and then shortly after asked for our drink order.  We looked through the menu and were totally floored at the cost of what appeared to be pretty basic food choices.  We were going to order guacamole until we realized it was $15 and  NOT even table side. Decided against it and ordered just entrees.  We nibbled on chips and boring salsa with too much heat while we waited for our food.  Our meals were delivered by someone other than our server and we were not asked if we needed anything else. Our server came by shortly thereafter though and asked.  We requested sour cream which he quickly brought.  But that was the last we saw him.  He never returned to ask how the food was. If he had, I would have told him the chicken tamale was dry with a disgusting flavor.  When he did return it was to clear our plates. But he never inquired why I hadn't finished my plate or if I wanted it boxed. Maybe he knew it was gross.  And I couldn't even wash it down because my glass was empty. ALL of ours were. No offer to refill just a question about dessert.  We decided to cut our losses, pay the $65 tab and leave.  When we walked by the hostess, there was no thank you, goodbye, how was it.  They were too busy chatting amongst themselves.   EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED.",

The price wouldn't have mattered if the food tasted great but it almost comparable to any regular fast food that would cost between $3-9 .

    "text": "Pancho's es fabuloso! The hostess greeted our group of four with cheer. My son was mesmerized with the suspended shark which decorates the 21 and older bar area, but were able to capture a photo of the two of them together. Our Sunday afternoon in Las Vegas, shopping in Downtown Summerlin, was thoroughly enjoyed with Mexican sumptuousness.  Miguel our server managed a magnificent job with us.  He split our order of an Ensalada de Camarones con Miel. The greens and jicama were fresh, cool and crispy.  The mango slices were sweet and abundant.  He recommended an accommodation to the Children's Menu for us when I requested a side order of one grilled chicken breast (similar to the chicken breast available for the salad).  He replaced the Chicken Tenders entree with a marinated, grilled and cut chicken breast, with a side of pinto beans de la holla and rice (with a cilantro pesto). Children's Plates served with rice, beans, or fries children 12 years and under.   The bean choice are the whole pinto bean cooked in a pot, black beans, or traditional refried beans.  Also, there are two types of rice of choice. Each of our meals were accompanied with a fresh, fruit bowl appetizer including watermelon, apple, pineapple and cantaloupe chunks. Crisp chips were paired with a red, zesty tomato salsa.    There are several reasons for Pancho's to be a kid-friendly restaurant. The women's bathroom has a changing table. The decor is festive and fun. Music plays lightly in the background and on designated evenings there is live music.  I am looking forward to mariachi music perhaps the middle of September!  A child's dinner includes a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Chocolate milk is a drink option.    For Pancho's to gain one more star from me, I would like to see organic and free-range options on the menu.  Also, the emphasis on local produce would be a nice addition to community support.  And since I am always reaching for the stars, I would like to find a restaurant where patrons can watch tortilleros hard at work while enjoying an authentic Mexican meal.",

I am kind of biased to 'Tex Mex' so it is hard for me to have a fair opinion of Mexican food anywhere else.  The meal here was pleasing and they had ground beef tacos. Which have been a challenge for me to find outside of Texas.  Lastly, the service was very efficient and respectful.  Had a nice lunch and enjoyed the festive environment.",

We were seated immediately and offered drinks and salsa and chips.  The salsa was a tad bland.  Chips were fresh and yummy. I ordered the Chimichanga de Carne Asada and E ordered Chimichanga del Mar which was a Flour tortilla filled with sauteed shrimp and genuine crab, onions, tomatoes, bell pepeprs and rice then deep fried. Complemented with sour cream and gucamole.  The food came out and it wasnt horrible but not that great.  The chimichangas were kind of soggy and not piping hot as if they had just come out of the oil.  Our waitress was extremely sweet and efficient. I checked in on yelp and we got a fried ice cream  OMG I havent had one of those since Chi-Chi's years and years ago (probably showing my age here).  So gross.  I remember the outside being warm.  Well this tasted like stale cornflakes on top.  NO crunch whatsoever like they fried it and threw it back in the freezer.  We scraped it all off and just ate the ice cream. Will we go back?  Eh probably not because for the price of almost $50 the warm food just wasnt worth it",

    "text": "It took a long time for us to try Pancho's, mainly due the fact that they close at 9:00, which doesn't suit my Night Owl schedule. But a recommendation by a new-to-Vegas friend, plus a coupon in the mail finally spurred action.    I was impressed by the beautiful decor, both in the cantina and the dining area. We sat in the dining room, and service was friendly and efficient, probably amped up because it was close to closing, and the staff wanted to get out of there!  I found the drinks to be way overpriced. Skipped my usual margarita and had a glass of wine, but not because of the price, since the wine was up there, too.  We shared an Ensalada Verde, and it was gorgeous, with the additional beets and garbanzos adding to the flavor. My husband ordered Enchiladas Suizas, and I had Mole en Pipian. I forgot to specify black beans instead of refritos, and was gratified to find that my dish came that way; his, however, did not.  I tried his enchiladas, and they were up there with the best I've ever had. But while the mole sauce from my dish was very tasty, the chicken was another story: dried out and tough. It was obvious that it was not freshly made. Because of the late hour, I was just going to slog through it. But a manager passed by, and when he asked how our dinner was, I told him. Instantly, he wanted to give me something else, so I figured that I'd get those terrific enchiladas. Having filled up on the chips and the very good salsa, though, I'd eaten enough, and had a fabulous meal the next night.  Even with a $16 coupon, the bill was high. We like to stick to local restaurants because we eat out a lot, and it can make a big dent in the wallet. While I look forward to going back, I'll try to go earlier next time. But I may temper my sense of adventure and order those enchiladas again. They were sooooo good. But with black beans next time.  Ambience - 5/5 Service - 5/5 Food - 4/5 Value - 4/5",

It reminded me of restaurants I'd been to in a couple Mexican Mercados or even some in NM where I lived for a while. Service was good and like I mentioned food was good but it wasn't Amazing for the cost at the slightest. They do offer free check ins so don't forget to get that.

The main downfall for this place in my opinion is the lack of veggie-friendly food. Granted, if I wanted a full-blown veggie menu there are other options but this day and age it seems like at least most restaurants have at least a handful of veggie plates/pickings to choose from. This is not the case here... I found two or three options on the main menu but none on the happy hour menu.  I stuck with chips and salsa but my friends did order some food. They ate a bit but took the rest to go so it must have been at least good. I wish there was more food that I could try! The service was great, though, so that's a plus. Our bartender greeted us within a minute and we had chips and salsa at the table a minute later. Drinks came out quickly and we were given feedback as to what drinks were best and which drinks to order to get the most alcoholic mixed in. Shout out bartender!",

    "text": "For the 3 years or so Pancho's has been there I had been avoiding it because of my perception that it was over-priced compared to other Tex/Mex restaurants.  I decided to give it a go today for a late lunch/early dinner because I was in the area.  I was seated at a two top immediately and I began to look over the menu.  When I checked in on Yelp, I noticed there was a free fried ice cream offer for the check in.  Not bad.  I ordered the pollo a la diabla which the menu describes as:  Tender pieces of boneless chicken sauteed with caramelized onions, roasted garlic and artichoke hearts. Simmered in a special Diabla sauce with roasted Guajillo chiles and Chef Ramon's special herbs. Served with green rice and black beans.  The diabla sauce had some kick to it--not enough to be a bother to most diners.  I enjoyed it enough that I didn't ask for Cholula or some kind of sauce to add to it.  There was a serving or rice and some place beans with cotija cheese.  The dish was very enjoyable.  When it came time, I told my server, Gustavo, that I had the Yelp check in offer and he watched as I marked the offer as used.  A little later, out came this large bowl with what would be two scoops of fried ice cream instead of the normal single scoop.  The menu describes the dish this way: Vanilla ice cream covered with crispy Corn Flakes and cinnamon. Served with a caramel sauce and whipped cream.  It was excellent and a good ending to a good meal.  The restaurant is nicely appointed and has several living plants and trees.  The stairs go to the main kitchen upstairs and it's amazing to watch the servers run up the stairs and walk down quickly with their full trays.  Service was very good.  Gustavo brought me fresh iced tea 3 times and he stopped by to check in with me after I had the main course for a small amount of time to see if everything was OK.  I won't be skipping Pancho's anymore.  The prices are comparable to others in the general neighborhood.  The only thing that drove me crazy was the table that moved back and forth depending on whether I put weight on my end.  That's irritating anywhere.",

    "text": "I really like Panchos for brunch. Sometimes all you need for a pick me up is some tacos and margaritas. I like getting there Tacos El Pastor Tijuana.  It comes with 3 street style pork tacos , beans and rice. Sipping a flavored margarita (strawberry) makes for a perfect meal. We also get a side of guacamole that comes with the free salsa and chips. The guacamole is nice and chunky. The left over guac we use with our entree like I'll put it on my tacos. If you love a not so soggy Tres Leche Cake I highly suggest it. The atmosphere is relaxing especially is you sit by the fountain.  This is a great place for a date or if you want to go with a group of friends!",

I added strawberry puree and it still didn't help. I order crab n shrimp quesadilla it's was ok not the best. I love guacamole and this guac wasn't that good. Didn't taste fresh it taste plain and again NO FLAVOR.  I usually like this place for happy hour at the bar. I'm guessing I should only do just that IF SO ... I don't recommend this place. I love Mexican food I will have to continue my search here in vegas",

We joked that maybe we had picked an expensive place, but the prices were reasonable considering the environment/location. I had the tacos al pastor and my boyfriend had the burrito ranchero. My tacos were great and I was super happy that I made that choice. My boyfriends burrito was huge and delicious, but he mentioned he wished it had rice. This isn't our favorite Mexican restaurant but it is definitely a very good one and we will be back for date nights. The service was great, too. Our server Claudia was very attentive and nice. Thanks for the great experience!",

Honestly it was nothing special but definitely the most overpriced tacos I've ever had. My boyfriend ordered the mole pepian and we ended up sending it back. The taste was so bland the complete opposite of what you'd expect when ordering mole. The only good thing was the tortilla soup that came with it. The portions are big but still overpriced.

We walked in without a reservation, and were seated within a few seconds.  The waiter greeted us within a minute.    We were offered some courtesy chips and salsa, and water.  The only problem was our waiter was in a rush.  There was no real recommendations, nor  a good breakdown of the menu.   This is a definite issue for us.    We did push the waiter for some assistance, and were able to make a few menu decisions.   We ordered chicken fajitas, tortilla soup, and some steak.  The waiter offered extra chicken for $5 more.  Do not do this.  The portions are HUGE.   The soup was delicious, lots of chicken, tomatoes, seasoning.   The steak was extremely salty.  All the fixings for the fajitas were average, small table spoons of sour cream, guacamole, some rice,  lots of beans, and 3 small tortilla shells.    For drinks we had a pina colada, and ginger ale.",

As I sipped on my mildly cold beer and forced my stomach to indulge in some flavor challenged guacamole, I kept thinking to myself - \" this has to get better.\"  Flavorless chicken fajitas and rubbery Camerones (shrimp) left me hating myself after I paid for my overpriced letdown.

Over the top ! 19.99 for 2 tacos and rice and beans ? I looked over at the table next to us and asked them how they liked the food . They responded \" Food was ok , small portions and they didn't realize how expensive the meals cost and said they will only come back for special occasions . So after the 4 of us looked at the menu .. We all decided to leave and go to macayos . The total bill at macayos was 65 bucks including 4 beers . We figured at \"Panchos\" the same meal would have been over 125 with out the tip . I really want to like \"Panchos\" but I can't see my self paying 19.99 for rice and beans and 2 tacos . Hopefully they will realize that there prices are not for the local budget and they are as much as the Las Vegas strip . This is only my opinion and I do hope to return some day . I give it 5 stars for the decor  And the atmosphere . I'm pretty sure it cost a pretty penny to build this place . But that's not a reason to charge so much for Mexican food .",

When I finally dined there the place was really underwhelming. First of all there is no carpet in the restaurant & it sounds like a warehouse. I ordered a chili verde burrito which is a staple in Mexican kitchens & it seemed that the pork was cooked separately from the sauce which enables them to use it with multiple sauces. The pork in Chile Verde should be cooked or braised in the sauce which emparts meat juice in the sauce. This unctuous experience was totally absent at Panchos & considering my companions mediocre dish I most definitely will not return to Panchos. This is a classic Americanized Mexican restaurant and I strongly prefer to eat at more authentic eateries!",

I was looking forward to this restaurant opening and hoping for really great, authentic ( or at least USA style authentic), Mexican food. The building is very nice and the server was very polite and attentive....other than that.....  We went early on a Thursday afternoon ( 4 PM) and the restaurant was not busy at this point. The hostess took us to what must be the worst table in the restaurant. It was in the back and near the kitchen door and  the server station. Normally, I would have objected and asked for another table, but this being our first time there, I wanted to see what else was in store. I am familiar with the concept of filling tables back to front, but this was a bit extreme based on the hour and the number of customers. It did give me a good view of part of the kitchen, which looked clean and well maintained. The server was at our table almost immediately and took our drink order. I ordered a traditional Margarita on the rocks. Hubby had a draft beer. The Margarita had a minimal amount of Tequila and was not at all remarkable in taste.Chips and salsa came to the table, and the salsa ,while a bit spicy , was lacking in any depth of flavor. I decided to go with  a classic combo, beef taco and cheese enchilada and my husband ordered the Carne Asada Al La Ab. The combo, priced at $17.95,does not come with salad or soup. Unusual in my experience. My husband's entree did get the soup or salad choice. The Carne Asada has Hanger steak and my husband was not asked how he liked it cooked, which I assume represents that it's already prepared. The entrees were delivered in a timely manner. My entire plate was lackluster and had none of the savory deliciousness that I would expect from that plate. The shredded beef in the taco, the cheese enchilada and even the rice and beans were all very bland. My husband's Hanger steak tasted OK, it was medium well to well done...but had some taste to it. The other components on the plate were the same as mine. Unfortunately, I see no reason to return to this place. The food is pricey for Mexican, which would be OK if it was really good, and it was, at best, just OK.",

Most places have a vegan/vegetarian menu or can accommodate me. Well they had two vegan items. One was a salad (who wants a salad at a mexican place? Not this girl) and the other option had a wheat flour tortilla and I can't have wheat. I asked if there was anything else they could do to help accommodate me and they said no. I then ordered just a side of beans which they brought and it was covered in cheese lol I didn't want to complain since I already felt like a pain and just let my mom eat the beans. I promptly left and went somewhere else to eat. Seriously disappointed considering  nice of a place this is and I love the location.",

Bland food - first time EVER added salt to shrimp tacos 4. Good server and nice atmosphere 5. $8.00 for a small bowl of soup?  Prices jacked WAY UP for downtown Summerlin.  Better Mexican at several places nearby.  Sorry to say, it's doubtful we will return or recommend.  Seems other people feel the same according to the reviews.",

    "text": "Just to be objective in my assessment, this is visit #3. I ordered Enchiladas de Mole, traditional Mole Poblano made from Ancho and Pasilla chiles, sesame seeds and peanuts. It was good BUT, what I should have ordered was the Pollo en Mole Verde with a green cilantro lime rice. The food after three visits here both at lunch and dinner is consistently good, spot on high quality ingredients.  The service: in all fairness, my first visit was chaos because it was opening week. The following two visits both dinner and now lunch, the bar staff is exceptionally engaging and gregarious (Kelly & Jessica).  The Margaritas: base tequila is Cuervo Gold. Total liquor is 2.25-oz. at a painful $10.50. The three closest competitors within less than a 5mi radius use a 100% Agave tequila unlike Cuervo's (mixto), pour 3-oz of liquor at $11. One establishment has it at $10 using Patron at 2.75-oz. The bottom line: Food is good, service is good, booze is above average albeit value-wise it fails. One final note; it is truly a shame that anyone can Google their Manhattan Beach menu and see that the Las Vegas pricing is a whopping $3 more straight across the board! Did they not think that the Las Vegas locals were not smart enough to investigate that??? The happy hour is loooong! Starting at 2/2:30 through 6pm but, it is so complicated!! And, worse yet, of no real value. A $2 savings is not a happy hour although, I suppose if you milk it by staying the entire 3+ hours then MAYbe it's a better value.",

The decor is nice but that's it.. The place was pretty empty so we got our table right away .. We ordered two margaritas , they were just ok nothing worth getting excited over especially the high price !! Next we ordered guacamole for an appetizer .. I was expecting a table side creation but that wasn't the case , waitress went to the kitchen and brings a cute \"little \" bowl of guacamole and chips!! Tasteless , flavorless and down right bland!! We had to add salsa to it to give it some sort of taste !!  Next up ..... Chicken quesadilla and carne asada quesadilla .. We split both and I preferred the carne asada ...  It was ok but again nothing worth $18 for ..  So for 2 margaritas , guacamole , 2 quesadillas.. It came out to $77 FOR LUNCH! $HIT really !  Service was fine , food was subpar .. I figured that because they are located in downtown Summerlin they think they can fool the locals with subpar food and gouge the shit out of us!! Seriously Panchos ?? Think about what you're doing .. I'm a Tex-Mex and have lived here for 25 years, you have no idea what Mexican food is.. Stop trying to fool people with your crappy over priced food .. Totally out of line ... Either drop your prices by 50% or make better food by 100%..  I tried talking a friend out of going but he had to learn the hard way .. He too was very disappointed and said his $23 carne asada plate wasn't worth 1/2 that..  Needless to say we won't be back..",

I had the Trios Los Panchos and it was HUGE! This plate has the chicken, beef and cheese enchilada covered with special sauce (chili)  with sour cream and rice and beans. The beans are home made and the chicken was sooo tender! We had the Tres Leche cake for dessert and YUMMMMY! Light and fluffy milk cake with whipped creme frosting. The service was wonderful and our waiter Jose answered all questions regarding the spiciness of the food. Great atmosphere as the plants are real and the sound of a water fountain adds to the enjoyment of your meal. A definitely great dining experience!!",

Strike #1, they don't take orders over the phone.  My friend went to the bar and ordered without looking at the menu since we did that online.  Strike #2, no prices online.  I get this for really expensive gourmet restaurants, but not Panchos, really?  He gets the food and the bill.  $127 before tip for 4 people!  He gets home and tells us this fact and eat only to find out that the food is DEFINITELY not worth the price we paid.  Strike #3, cost to value of the food is NOT worth it.  Major fail!  We will never go back or recommend this place.  The food was decent but the price was about twice what it should have been for most of the things we ordered ($15 for Guacamole, $20 for two fish tacos, $17 for two beef tacos w/ rice and beans...).  I'll continue to go to Lindo or Frijoles!",

If you want cheap Mexican go to Roberto's, ya get what you pay for and I thought Pancho's was worth the price. I'll definitely be back. Mmm and their salsa was nice and spicy.",

I got the gold Margarita... actually might be the worst Margarita I have ever had. Watered down... Almost no lime. I love Margaritas and am not that picky. I'll drink a Stations 99 cent Margarita and find a way to enjoy it. I could have died for one of those. First time I've considered sending a drink back. If you are considering eating here.... I'd pass. My wife warned me. Even then I was still disappointed. With so many choices you'd think they would have a bar to reach. Not even close... If you have a choice go somewhere else. Go. This was bad enough for me to write a review... Usually I don't write anything but it's worth saving others. My friends want to go back for taco Tuesday. Think I'll decline.",

My son Ordered a personal pizza which was 1O dlrs for a microwaved Wallmart Pizza. Queso Fundido is a dish that is really hard to mess up and somehow they managed to mess that up too. They don't carry seafood!!!! What kind of Mexican restaurant does not carry seafood? Worst Mexican Restaurant I have ever been too and the worst food I've ever had. By the way this restaurant isn't ran by Mexicans either. It's just a Restaurant with a Mexican name to it to attract customers and rip them off. Don't eat there! You'll regret it. PS. They even messed up my Michelada WTF???",

    "text": "As the new Mexican restaurant on the block in Downtown Summerlin, I decided it was time to give Pancho's a try.  Upon our arrival at night the restaurant was loud with live rock music from singers on a stage, but the decor was lovely hacienda style.  Guacamole in a metate with a tortilla chip base was real spicy, but there was a ton of it.   We waited a substantial time before anyone appeared to take our order, and then were first contacted by the manager, followed by the hostess, and finally our waiter.  Not too many chips were in the basket provided, so we had to request more; they were quickly supplied.    I enjoyed a good Shredded Beef Taco and an ultra-cheesy Burrito Ranchero with shredded beef, but the interior of Diane's Quesadilla Del Mar (with shrimp) was made wrong, and it seemed to take forever to correct the error.  The lights in the kitchen went off before arrival of the correct version, and we thought the entire kitchen staff had gone home.  But not to worry--the belated replacement entree arrived at our table shortly thereafter, and was accurately prepared to order.  3-1/2 stars overall, but as others have noted, one can find better Mexican fare elsewhere in the city at a much lower price point.  So, it seems dining patrons are being charged extra for the fine special authentic hacienda ambiance.",

My someone and I split the burrito vegan style with the veggie mix option. Also grabbed on a side of salsa and chips on top of already eating the complementary chips and salsa... and two cups of the vegan fideo soup. All were super tasty and authentic. The price is on point for this sit down eatery. And you will feel like you're getting your moneys worth as well. Vegans won't suffer here. The menu is full of options... and I saw breakfast options also that I will be in to try. There is actually two menus you are handed when you sit down, one for vegans and one for others. Seriously would be a great place for tacos and beers as they have a nice selection. This place would be perfect for lunch or dinner solo or with family and friends. Tomorrow is taco Tuesday and I may have to swing by for lunch!",

Our party of 6 decided to check it out after hanging out at nearby TPC Summerlin all day.  The building and decor kinda made you feel like you weren't in Vegas anymore, but when it comes down to it, TASTE is everything. Heading straight for the entrees section of the menu, I like to try a Mexican restaurant's Chile Relleno as a test, so I ordered the three item combo which also came with an enchilada and a taco. Chips and store bought tasting salsa are also brought to the table as well. Entrees arrive, and as I bite into the chile relleno, it has a slight crunch!? A sign of the pepper not being roasted enough before being peeled and stuffed. The enchilada was okay, and the taco shell was stale with the meat being dry. I also tried a bite of Wifey's Seafood Burrito and the seafood definitely wasn't the freshest.  Apparently, there are two kinds of rice served here. A green, and a red. Those in our party who had the green rice enjoyed their order, while people with the red rice had crunchy bits in them. a sign of either sitting out uncovered, or prolonged time under the heating lamp as orders were being filled. Prices here are ridiculously up there(I believe all entrees were $16 or higher). The Company was good and service was pleasant, but I wish I could say the same for the food quality here. With tons of other dining options in Downtown Summerlin, you are seriously better off elsewhere. Just read the reviews and tips if you still plan to take a chance here.  ALOHA!!!

Comes with a dollop of sour cream in the middle, with two slices of avocado on top of a burrito that is semi-glazed with some cheese sauce.  The atmosphere is nice, and so is the server, but when you had to wait about 20+ minutes for Mexican food off-Strip on a Monday night, it's either amazing, or there's something a bit wrong.  I'm actually shifting towards the latter.  The atmosphere is a great place, and perhaps they justify the cost due to it being in Downtown Summerlin.   But, there just wasn't anything enlightening about it.  Maybe it's just me.  The burrito I ordered cost about $19.  Honestly, it's probably worth about $12.  Unless the ingredients were all fresh, farm raised, organic and all that, I just don't see it.  Maybe they do... Trader Joe's is right across from there.  Somehow, I doubt it though.  Vegas isn't SoCal, and this wasn't a Strip experience.  Unfortunate.",

They are so so, when we went there it was almost dead inside hardly anyone there, but yet the parking lot looked really busy. But it seemed like it took for ever to get our drink orders and then had to keep asking for chips and salsa to be refilled. We had a party of about 6-7 but they seemed like we were more of burden than dinner guests. I mean if you want to try them then you can but I dont think you will be really thrilled since there are much better places to eat.",

That made precisely zero sense but I didn't feel like debating it. I'll be honest, I didn't check the price. Those 2 tacos (chicken, lettuce, cheese, pico) & a half a cup of rice & beans came to a whopping $19 pre-tip. I will pay for scrumptious food. Unfortunately, this was not. The chicken did not have a morsel of flavor & the beans were overcooked. It's also worth noting that making up the salsa were so many huge chunks of what looked like stewed tomatoes that I could have used them to make homemade pasta sauce. & there was so much cilantro in the salsa that it may as well have been a side salad. My assessment? Save your money & hit up Taco Bell.",

I have traveled all over Mexico - even lived in Oaxaca for the better part of a year - and I have never seen anything like this there!  I think it's an attempt at 'Tex-Mex,' that horrible sauce laden aberration that comes from the land of George W. Bush.  I had a chili-relleno and a cheese enchilada.  Of course, both were drowning in the same horrible red sauce (thank you, Texas) but the cheese was strictly American and the Chili was barely cooked.  It was so crunchy, it bordered on raw.  What once may have existed as an eggy batter was musched up with that gross sauce, I mean:  just disgusting!  Anyone claiming that this is 'Authentic' should be flogged.  The only Latino faces in the place belonged to the servers who, I am sure, were secretly apologizing every time they lay down a plate.  The price is as bad as the food - at least 30% more than it should be if not 50%.  $7.50 for a glass of Dos XX in the middle of Sunday afternoon?  Puleeeeeze!!!  Adios, muchachos, dios te bendiga and all that.  Avoid this one like Montezuma's Revenge!",

Unfortunately, that was the best part.  The hostesses at the front seemed confused and took a long time to figure out where to seat our party of 4, even thought the restaurant had lots of open tables.  Service was underwhelming, took a long time to get drinks and order our food.  Food was fine, nothing special considering the prices were very high compared to other Mexican restaurants in the area.  They can't beat Juan's Flaming Fajitas for great Mexican food, awesome service and reasonable prices.  I was hoping to find a great Mexican alternative closer to home, but Panchos isn't it for our family unfortunately.",

The place has a nice decor in the main dinning area, but in the bar area it does not. It's just one big room with tvs and uncomfortable high chairs and tables. The food is highly over priced for Mexican food specially for tasteless food. To start with they give you a small basket of chips and the chips tasted greasy. I had Enchiladas Suizas (2) for $19.95, it came with a small portion of beans and rice and it was warm and not hot. My wife had a dish called Pork Tinga $21.95 and it also was warm and not hot, it came with a small ramekin of beans and rice with flour tortillas (she wasn't given a choice between corn or flour) which were thick and cold. Both dishes had no flavor at all. The service was slow even though it was friendly you could tell that it's a very inexperienced staff. In short a three ring circus. I would NOT recommend this place to anyone. For the two dishes an iced tea and Diet Coke the total was $49.53. We don't mind paying for good food, but this place has none. It's a shame that such a great location and beautiful building has the audacity to charge such prices for terrible food and service. If they don't make changes quickly it will be a one time experience for many who try it, therefore, it will fail within the year at most. My recommendation to anyone..... Don't waste your time and money on this restaurant there are other Mexican restaurants in town that are much better than this place and for half the price. Don't waste your time!!!",

It did not come with tortillas,  which I thought was standard, my mistake. For my main course, I had the enchiladas del Mar with crab and shrimp. The enchiladas by themselves were alright,  but the rice & beans were awful. The garnishment on the rice looked like a side salad of carrots and cabbage....WAY TOO MUCH!  Service was decent. The layout of the restaurant is horrible on the upper level. There is not much space for aisle walking and you walk right past other tables, almost brushing them. I think if I was fat, I would've hit the guests.  Our wait time was 1 hr 45 minutes, we ended up waiting about an hour, which we were happy about. The last thing we ended with was the tres leches, it was the best part of the whole night. Only thing missing is fresh strawberries on top. I won't be back.

The wait for a table on a Saturday evening was about an hour so we decided to eat in the bar area. Well, we were informed you can only be served drinks and appetizers in the bar. Really? Big mistake, Pancho's! I know of no other restaurant with such a ridiculous policy. The margaritas were okay and we liked the chips and salsa. Bar waitress was fabulous and fun. I did notice that the Tiffany style chandeliers (I don't know how these fit the Mexican theme) over the bar were an afterthought as they were run on exposed electrical conduit which perplexed me as the building was just constructed.   We were called to the dining area after approximately 45 minutes but of the 5-6 hostesses ready to seat us, not one had a clue of what to do and we waited more than 5 minutes at the hostess stand while they figured it out.  Upon entering the dining room, I literally felt as if I had walked into a jungle. The place is filled with an extreme, almost obnoxious,  amount of artificial plants and trees. Clearly the concept of \"less is more\" was lost on the designers. The lighting is very bright (might want to heavily consider dimming in the evenings) and there was no background music playing so we weren't impressive with the atmosphere. Our waiter was very good and attentive which made for a pleasant dining experience. I had the lobster enchiladas (really delicious!) and my husband had chicken chimichanga (he liked it but it didn't knock his socks off). We didn't stick around to have another drink or desert because the atmosphere was not inviting. My husband commented on the walk to the car that he probably wouldn't go back and unfortunately, I'd have to agree with him.",

I would have to say this is my first negative review and simply because I don't go out of my way to tell people how horrible they are. However this time I can't let this go without telling people. This is my second time coming to this restaurant. The first time I came here it was amazing. This time I can't say the same. One thing I will say is our server Carissa was amazing. She was so sweet and came to check on us several times. For the management I can't say the same. There was a older gentleman that would walk around and say hi to the tables and make sure everything is ok. The whole time we sat there he did not come up to us once. The tables around us, yes he did but seemed to just pass us by every time. I thought it was odd until I brought it up to the other two other people with me. They noticed the exact same thing. What did all these tables have in common? They were all white and so was the manager. There were two other  tables he did not go up to. Another table whom were Hispanic like us and a table with Asians. This manager will sit and chat with each table once or twice but yet never made it to our table or the other two tables. I'm sorry I hate to play the race card but I never experienced something like this in my whole life. A restaurant that serves Mexican food and they didn't even acknowledge not just us but two other tables. But the other 6 to 7 tables he could. Blows my mind.",

Nothing we ate was good, service was nothing special, and the food is EXPENSIVE for what you get. I guess they figure they can price gouge you because its in downtown Summerlin.  The carnitas were tough, flavorless, and did not appear to be fresh. The carnitas burrito is $17.95, came topped with cold Chile queso sauce (bland) and not a side of rice and beans in sight. For 18 dollars.... Really? The side of guacamole was 8.95. For a modest scoop of once again, flavorless guacamole. I mean, there isn't an authentic thing about this place, the plates are garnished with parsley for goodness sakes. Where's the cilantro? The limes? The flavor?!?!?!  We paid our $71 tab (no alcohol) (for two people and a toddler) and walked out quietly. The first thing we said to each other when we got to the car was, \"never again.\" Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, nope you won't fool me twice.  If you are looking for decent Mexican in the area try viva mercados on sahara and ft. Apache, or even better, casa don Juan on buffalo and lake Mead, or Frank and finas cocina on flamingo and grand canyon..",

I'm a little surprised people are saying the food was overpriced. I ordered a combo plate with an enchilada and a taco, my roommate ordered a combo of 2 chicken tacos. Both had huge portions of rice and beans, and the tacos were served with guac and sour cream. We each got a Diet Coke and the bill was $39 and some change, roughly $20 each before tip. The value of the food for the price was as expected, and not outrageously over priced - to those people I would say that if you can't afford to eat out, simply stay at home; cook and serve your own food if you don't want to pay for it.  As far as the actual food goes, it was very good. I've been looking for good Mexican food in Las Vegas ever since I came from California, I finally found it! :)",

Upon getting the menu I proceeded to check it out.  The cheapest entree for lunch was $15.00. Come on,  really  2 tacos $15.00. 2 enchiladas $15.00.   a house green salad $7.00.  The Margaritas are made with sweet and sour.  Jesus. They don't even know how to make a real margarita  My enchiladas were so bad I only ate one.  I give Panchos 6 months and Adios.

When we moved out here 6 years ago we were so disappointed with the lack of great Mexican food.  Lindo Michoacan and Flaming Fajitas are good options we have stuck with, but nothing is really \"great\" here.  Pancho' has changed that!  Their chicken tortilla soup has the flavor of my grandmother's chicken soup as the base -- the tastiest!  And the mole... yum!  I've ordered mole so many times in vegas and been disappointed that I finally gave up.  My husband ordered it because I refused to take another risk.  Boy was it excellent!  And the service was top notch.  Miguel should get an award for his friendliness.  The bussers stopped by frequently as well, and we even had the manager stop by a few times.  I can't rave enough about this place!  The brunch includes fruit and champagne as standard, even if you don't order off the brunch menu.  We will definitely be back.  I'm disappointed it took us so long to come and try it!",

    "text": "This is the PF Chang's of Mexican food. I don't mean it as a compliment, but I also understand the need for such places. It is regular Mexican fair at double the price. Maybe it's necessary because of the expense of the DS location. Yes, the food is good, not great, but I wasn't disappointed. The salsa actually had a kick to it. It wasn't watered down. But $15 for a burrito with no sides? I've tried to argue that I could've gotten the same burrito at Cardenas or Roberto's for half that, easy. But then again, Roberto's and Cardenas market food court isn't exactly where Summerlinites would go out for a family meal or a date. I get it.  Just look around you. How many actual hispanic people do you see there (besides the employees)? ZERO. Why would that be? I personally don't eat at Korean restaurants where there are no Koreans eating there no matter how nice the place looks. But I still gave them the benefit of the doubt because of the demographics of Summerlin. But Vegas as a whole has a big enough Hispanic community that you would see at least one person eating here on a busy Saturday afternoon if this place was really that good. The Michiochan restaurants are full of Hispanic families.  The entire decor is designed to attract the non Hispanic Summerlin crowd into thinking they're eating ethnic food without having to drive down to questionable parts of town to do so. I would rather eat at Cardenas market and get similar quality for half the price. But yes, it's not a viable option for some people. Again, I get it. So you must pay double for the atmosphere.   But the final punch in the gut was paying $9.99 for a kids meal that was 1/3 frijoles, 1/3 rice, and 1 enchilada (or 1 taco, but to make it a fish taco was extra $). NO DRINKS included. I guess we live in Summerlin so we can afford to pay, right? It's what Upper-Middle Class people do, overpay for EVERYTHING.",

We went there tonight at 6 p.m. with a party of four. Started with premium margaritas all around which were weak and tasted like a lime slurpee. We asked for no salt on all ... nope. Wait staff was very kind and courteous; however, when we received three of our entree's ... the fourth never came. Not for a while. After we decided to \"go ahead\" figuring the fourth entree' would be right out ... the manager stopped by. He asked how everything was going and we replied that we had been waiting for one of the ordered entree's, \"carnitas\". He was very apologetic BUT after another 5 or 10 minutes  or so, the entree came ... Fish Tacos. What? The manager came back and was bumbling with excuses about how carnitas couldn't be properly cooked here in Las Vegas unlike in Manhattan Beach, California where the other Pancho's is located. He said, \"Princess it must be perfect to serve &  I'm sorry we will not charge you for the entree that you didn't get\". Really? So while we waited for the entree' I ordered a Carona Lite (after finishing my watery margarita). We ate the food and all complained how salty it was but so be it... that's a matter of taste (even though all 4 of us said the same thing). The icing on the evening was I never received the beer I ordered. Again, the manager apologized and took one entree (that was never received) and a beer (that was never received) off the bill of well over $120. I paid the bill but needless to say this place failed miserably. Our first time here and we'll not return and tell everybody we know how crappy it was. We have lived in Las Vegas for over 25 years and are used to waiting ... the restaurant was packed. Don't know why as our experience was disappointing compared to even Macayo Vegas which has better quality and for less than half the cost ... BUT they don't have those fun, pretty festive colors.

    "text": "Grossly overpriced, very small portions, and sub-standard ingredients.  I ordered a shrimp and crab chimichanga, which cost $21.95.  For that price, I expected large shrimp and chunks of crab meat, and a reasonably substantial menu item.  Instead, I was served the smallest chimichanga I've seen in any Mexican restaurant, filled with tiny bay shrimp and a miniscule portion of finely shredded crab meat.  My wife ordered nachos with no meat, at a cost of $15.95.  They were half the size of those served at Nacho Daddy for the same price.  My wife and I visit Mexican restaurants for dinner at least twice a month, and have patronized most of the Mexican restaurants in town.  If this wasn't the worst Mexican food experience we've encountered, it certainly comes close.  We will never again be a patron of Pancho's, and would not recommend that restaurant to anyone craving a good dining experience.  It's ashame that the proprietors didn't put as much thought into the food quality and menu pricing as they did regarding the facility's decor",

We had dinner at the bar, so I can't rate the table service but the bartenders are great! #chavonnerocks We had the taquitos with guacamole to start. Very good. Not the best I have ever had but very solid offering with good home made guac. Chips and Salsa also very good. Previous review of sub-standard salsa is BS. My wife had the Burrito Del Mar with shrimp. Flavor and quality were great but could have included more shrimp than rice (we mentioned that after the fact, because it was not so serious that we would send it back - they comped us tequila shots as an apology #niceform). I had the chicken mole enchiladas. Best Mole in LV! Seriously strong. Really good food, beautiful place, nice bar tenders. We will be back! Regularly! And all of the complaints about pricing? Really? Look at the menu. Read the prices. It is not cheap but given the quality and portion size, I think that it is fair. Not cheap, but not out of line with other high-end mex like Mercardito at Red Rock. Hope that this is helpful and you will give this place a chance. Cheers!",

We were greeted & seated by a less-than cordial hostess in an uncomfortable table located under a large plastic plant that smacked me on my head throughout the entire meal.  We started our  meal with the guacamole appetizer. It was nothing more than a mashed up avocado with no detectable seasonings. Our three entrees (two seafood entrees and a carne asada dish were lovely to look at, but lacked anything that could be described as interesting flavor. All three dishes required us to look to whatever we had on our table (leftover chip salsa and salt) to perk things up. Three house margaritas at $11 each were as nondescript as our food. Our notably underwhelming dinner for three including a shared appetizer and three house margaritas was $105, not including tip. While not entirely an unpleasant experience, it wasn't worth the price if tasty Mexican food is an expectation.",

    "text": "Let me start with initial impressions.  Making a reservation was efficient, friendly and painless.  The building is beautiful and it is obvious that it was well thought out.  The interior is equally beautiful with a great looking theme.   Unfortunately the praise stops there.   After we were seated it was just under 9 minutes before our server acknowledged out existence and took our drink order.  Upon his return, he got two of the three incorrect.  Upon his second return he still had one of them incorrect.    After the drinks merry-go-round we ordered our meals. While awaiting our entrees we munched away on the fresh made chips that honestly were the shining star of the food offered here.   A server assistant wandered by and proceeded to refill the half empty glass of Sprite with water.  We pointed out the error and he replaced it fairly quickly.    Our entrees arrived in a reasonable amount of time but unfortunately only two of them along with a partial order for another table.  The third entree was delivered by the manager a couple of minutes later.  Part of me wishes that they never brought them to us.  What an uninspired, boring, and quite frankly tasteless group of entrees.  The chicken tacos has some very flavorful meat tucked inside a corn tortilla with little else.  The refried beans appear to be out of a can and the rice was bland.  This was an $18.00 entree!  The chicken burrito was just downright awful.  I think I have had a more flavorful burrito at Roberto's and Cafe Rio.   The chili verde burrito had some life in it.  The pork was properly cooked, the verde sauce was flavorful and it was presented nicely.   It was not served with the normally present beans/rice which was the same for the chicken burrito.   You would think that for $17.00 it would be a meal not just a burrito on a plate.    I spoke to the manager at length when he came by and sat down at the empty fourth seat.  Nice enough fellow who apologized for the service issues and heard my critique of the meal. I don't think he took my honesty to heart.     Overall I can say this place has some systemic issues that will close the doors within a year if they don't correct them.  The service is awful, the food is mediocre at best, the pricing is way out of line for comparable establishments in the Summerlin Mall.  I won't be back and will not be surprised when the name changes to RANDOM_NAME Michoacan.  What a waste of my money and whomever opened this place.   :(",

The rice was bad, the enchilada tortilla's tasted out of date, and I wouldn't be surprised is the chile relleno was for a health choice microwave dish. The place looks awesome. The prices are a little more than most mall Mexican restaurants. Service was prompt. But if you actually want to eat at a restaurant go anywhere else. Anywhere. I'll be surprised if this place stays a float for another year without changing the quality of food.",

    "text": "I'm surprised that this place is rated so mediocrely.  This is a great Mexican place in Summerlin!  They started the service with chips and salsa. The chips were crunchy and tasty and were paired with very fresh tasting salsa. It's also nice and spicy which we appreciated.   The salad was so-so but a good option for those wanting a fresh start. If they could add a Mexican cheese, a bit of guacamole and a salsa verde instead of the regular vinaigrette that would make this dish even better. Ask for a salsa verde on the side.   The tacos al pastor were very good. The meat is generous and marinated well so it was quite tasty.   The taquitos are a must-order. Typically I stay away from taquitos because it is so oily and heavy. But these are not the oil-laden taquitos you get from the neighborhood restaurant. They are lightly fried and stuffed with well-seasoned meat. They were generous with toppings and came with an awesome salsa verde.   But the best part of the night was the plate of carnitas enchiladas. The dish was deeply flavorful. There were so many layers of taste that came out that you can tell someone took great care to make this dish. The pork was so tasty but not overly seasoned as some carnitas can get. The garlic onion and cumin flavors are subtle enough to just bring out the pork flavor. The salsa cut the fatty taste of the pork in just the right way. The cheese and sour cream added heft to the dish. I loved it. The refried beans that came with the plate were not that glop of mush that you normally get in other restaurants. They were whole beans that had wonderful texture and taste.   Lastly, the service was great - Fernando was our server and was very nice. He worked fast and never tried to push us to order anything. When we asked him for suggestions, he didn't push the most expensive dish on the menu and actually told us what he thought was really good. The manager, Doug made sure to go up to every table and ask how things were going. It helped round out a great dinner.",

Hunny offered a carne asada chimi for $19.95 & it came beans, rice, guac & sour cream. The inside of the chimi looked like left over steak fajitas, but it wasn't bad tasting. Overall, it was just ok.

    "text": "Pancho's is a great spot. I love the classic California style Mexican restaurant layout as well as the traditional menu.   The food here is good. Honestly, it's not the best I've ever had, but it hits the spot when I'm craving Mexican, and it's a decent quality.  I'm always treated very well at Pancho's, and some of the servers recognize my family and me. We're always made to feel welcome. Even the management makes an effort to check on guests, which is great in this day and age. These managers are professional, by the way. They know what they're doing.  I agree that the prices are on the high end, but check your Val-Pak and other similar types of mailers. Pancho's puts some good coupons out in these, and you'll end up with a pretty reasonably priced meal for two or three people if you use one.  This is one of my go-to spots, and I'd recommend it if you're in the mood for Mexican food.",

Upon arriving and being seated, my party and I waited approximately 10 minutes after being seated before we were brought chips and salsa.  We are still awaiting the arrival of our water, or even for a waiter to ask if we would like a drink.  It was time to go when we watched as a party of 5 was seated and immediately OUR waiter proceeded to take their drink and appetizer order before they could even push their chairs on all the way.   Terrible service,  which is huge in terms of the dining experience.    As frequent visitors to Summerlin, always looking to try new eateries, especially Mexican food,  the lack of service received today at Pancho's was repelling to say the very least.",

There salsa that they bring to the table with the chips was a bit spicy just right for me, my kids were not a fan and my waiter was wonder and brought them bean dip they were happy. The food came out super fast and the waiter was very attentive to the table. Great experience will have to make another trip there.",

We had 4 dinner entrees, a glass of wine and a glass of beer. The bill was $133.00 which feels a little steep especially when the food is average. The entrees were reasonably large and perfectly edible so it's unlikely that you'll leave hungry. Our server was Karisa and she was awesome. Her area was very busy, but we never felt neglected. She is efficient and good at her job. She was really good and we appreciated her.  I probably won't be back. If the bill was $80.00, I'd come back, but not for $133.00.",

This place is exactly what I expect from a good Mexican restaurant in a strip mall.  For starters we had the guacamole. This was pretty good, and they were able to give it to me without cilantro! That's a big bonus for me, because I'm one of those people for whom cilantro tastes *terrible*. This also means they are more likely to have made it fresh, which I like.  My wife and I had entrees that were also good. The menu is so big that now, a few days later, I can't remember what I had.   I think that is a good example for this restaurant and why it gets 3 stars instead of 4. I remember that it was good. I remember that I enjoyed it and that I would eat here again if I were in the area. I don't remember anything really stand-out or special about it enough to really remember what I ate. It's just good Mexican food.",

Service was also very solid, polite and efficient.   So why three stars?  The food was extremely generic and somewhat flavorless.   The chips tasted like they were out of a bag, the salsa had almost no flavor and each entree was just \"meh\".    I had a cheese enchilada and taco combo.  I've had tastier microwave Mexican.   There wasn't anything wrong with it, but you would have a better experience at any chain Mexican restaurant.   The other big issue is the insanely high prices.  Expect to pay $17-20 for items that would be $9-11 at most other restaurants.   If the food was unique and flavorful this would be OK... but what we had?  Meh.",

However, we enjoyed the tacos al pastor and chicken quesadillas. The portions are pretty large, since I had a big appetite and bringing home leftovers. We enjoyed the house chips and spicy salsa. Oh yeah, when we checked in on yelp we received a complimentary fried ice cream dessert to share! It's was a pretty good size and delicious! I love the festive decor and ambiance.

I ordered chicken quesadilla for $16.95 and the chicken was shredded and tasted horrible. I have never seen shredded chicken quesadillas in somewhat of an upscale Mexican restaurant especially for the price that we got charged.  The shredded chicken is a low quality form of chicken that is very cost affective for restaurants . Most if not all Mexican restaurants, I've visited use grilled chicken breast instead.   I returned the dish and decided to ordered the Tacos Al Carbon which suppose to have Carne Asada for almost $20.00. Guess what? The red meat used was not Carne Asada, it was low grade red meat with a dreadful rubbery after taste.   We honestly did not mind the price and the atmosphere, but the quality of the food especially the meat products does not justify such high price on the menu.  I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for authentic and high quality Mexican food. We will definitely not visit this restaurant again.",

We had received a coupon (ha!) in the mail and thought really this is the only way to justify overpriced Mexican.   The bar was really bright and they had a cover band  singing  80's/90's rock which was very odd. We opted not for the bar and sat in dining room. It's actually really pretty inside with palm trees, string lights,  fountains, and Spanish tile.   The salsa was good. The guac is 14.95 which is a joke. We didn't receive it after ordering so we canceled it and saved ourselves 15bucks. The food was good enough and decent portions. Still hard to justify 20 bucks on menu items like quesadillas and burritos.   Glad I gave it a try since I see it so often, it's close to home and I love Mexican. Prob would go back to try happy hour (maybe) but def not for regular priced entrees. With so many other great places in the area, it feels semi insulting to offer average food at such a high price point in an inauthentic atmosphere. Esp when there's Roberto's around the corner ;)",

Both times I ordered the Chimichanga del Mar and it is one of the absolute best chimis I've ever had (and as a SoCal girl I've had way more than my far share).  During both visits the staff was friendly and accommodating, even though I'm one of those annoying customers who requests \"chipotle sour cream instead of regular, guac on the side and all rice / no beans please.\"  It is one of my new Vegas faves!",

I met some friends here for lunch prior to some shopping in Downtown Summerlin. It was our first time eating at Pancho's, although I had heard a lot of good things about the restaurant. We definitely enjoyed ourselves.  We started with guacamole, which I believe was around $7. Only thing is, it was a HUGE portion and we didn't even come close to finishing it. It was really good.  I ordered one of their combo meals (cheese enchilada and chile relleno), which came with rice and beans. Everything was fresh and tasty. We enjoyed their chips and salsa as well (probably too much). Our server was really friendly and I loved the decor. It reminded me of being home in San Diego and going down to Old Town to eat. I don't really think it's that overpriced, especially considering the portion sizes and the area.",

He did however bring out another sauce to try for next time I order it, which was awesome.  I love the location, ambience & sports memorabilia, especially the winners circle pix for racehorses!  Instead of giving them a bad rating for the first time, I decided to try them again.  Not only cause they were new at the time, but cause my friend has eaten here about ten times w/ no complaints!  He highly recommends them & knows Mexican food.  I've also been to the one in Manhattan beach which was great.  Older & more authentic feel, but always fantastic.  Helen in the bar area on Monday Night Football w/ happy hour & specials was FANTASTIC!  She not only brought me the mole sauces to taste so that I got the correct dish this time, but she was on top of everything!  The hot sauce, sour cream, oven baked or regular been burrito, etc.  Wow!    Dad ordered the Oven Baked Bean Burrito, I got the Mole Helen recommended & we tore it up lol!  It was so absolutely fantastic!  Mom's fish tacos weren't so good.  Instead of a chuck of Mahi Mahi she got tiny cubes.  Almost mushy & overwhelmed by the pico de gallo & cabbage.  Mom said she loved the chips & dip & service, but will never get the fish tacos.  I took a bite for this review & absolutely agreed.  However, we WILL be back.  5 stars for two of three dishes & exceptional service Helen.  We may only sit wherever she is lol.    Overall, I recommend the brown mole Enchiladas, oven baked bean burritos & fajitas.  Salude!",

The stained glass windows throw beautiful light throughout.  The restaurant is much larger than it looks with areas that are broken up.  If you sit in the courtyard area, it can be a bit noisy, but charming.  We enjoyed the chips and salsa.  The salsa while not hot, has a bit of a kick which makes you come back for more.  I had the seafood stuffed poblano pepper which was very enjoyable.  My wife had the fish tacos which were quite flavorful.  The sides of the rice and beans were heads above other Mexican restaurants.    I wish I had room to try desert, but will have to wait till next time.  We will be back!!!!",

Not sure how that happened since I asked for a vegetarian menu and the waitress even specified if I was okay with sour cream.

I've enjoyed the food here at least 10 times.   Ambience... The building is beautilful inside. See my pictures. Tons of light comes through the skylights, lighting up the jungle of living plants. Authentic mexican tiles adorn the stairs. This place really transports me out of vegas and into mexican nirvana.  Staff... wow every time they are so friendly and fast. Leaving a big tip is a pleasure when the staff is this good.   Food... I usually get the steak fajitas because they are other worldly good and so large that i don't eat anything else for the rest of the day. I've also tried all of the enchiladas and they are some of the best I've had. Don't even get me started on the amazing house margaritas. Definitely the best I've ever had.   Price... this is a bit more expensive than other mexican joints but ur paying for quality and exceptional service, ambience.   Other reviews... I'm absolutely dumbfounded to see Panchos doesn't have a 5 star rating on yelp. It's truly one of my favs in vegas and I eat at all of the best places. I believe people are ordering simple things like tacos and chimichangas and expecting it to b like taco bell. Or they are just offended by the higher prices.   Do yourself a favor and visit panchos. Ask the friendly waiter to recommend something or go with the fajitas which are called Rajitas at Panchos.",

Just gorgeous you guys really did a great job.   If yelp had another category on venue you  would score a 5++++   The food on the other side was a disappointment, really once I walkin I fell in love with the ambiance. During our meal I was still wanted to find reasons to go back!   Sadly we won't.   *The chips and salsa were good portions the salsa, taste and looks like the the Tostitos salsa from Costco and the chips are not consistent half of them stale half of them good. * Order a appetizer fried taquitos flavorful but odd to serve with Verde tomatillo sauce. Weird it wasn't spicy I guess it was for dipping didn't think it needed. Chichen was moist beef was ok. *They don't offer agua Fresca's only soda product not house made lemonade. *The abondigas soup broth was too thick the meatball itself was very flavorful and traditional but the broth and vegetables lacked seasoning. * ordered Lobster enchiladas they came with black beans green rice the green rice was blend no salt not sure if it was supposed to be cilantro rice enchiladas were okay black beans  good. * Then ordered chicken green mole was horrible so much cumin and bland. Accompanied with red rice and pinto beans the rice and beans were the best part of the whole meal. This is not an authentic Mexican style restaurant it caters more to the American palette, the has no indication of what real Mexican food should taste like.  In summerlin people act like they have money. The prices didn't bother me as much as the food is not worth the price. If the food was outstanding I wouldn't mind paying for great food and the amazing atmosphere the venue has.   The service staff on the other hand was very polite very cordial very helpful. Service staff was great so they get a a 5-star! :)",

The service has always been great for me. The restaurant is pretty, and it's in a great location. I like that they have live music in the bar!  Just don't care for the food.",

But they need to work on their bar area only high to bars.  Doc has restricted me from using my right foot so can't stretch it to sit at the bar tops in the bar the hostesses wooden honor the prices for happy hour for a bar only and weren't really accommodating finally the manager came over and said that he was aware of our situations and still honor the price.   So management=great  hostess = horrible service  server he apologize they're still new but we got our water after our meals and we had to ask for chips and salsa and someone had mentioned that you get fruit but we never got.  Willing to try again in 6 months if they last.",

One deep fried beef taco, perfect chile rellano and cheese enchilada. Came with rice and refried beans cooked to perfection. Their classic margarita was strong and in a large glass too. Soda comes with your own tableside pitcher  for refills. The deep fried ice cream was covered in what looked like corn flakes but it was a chewy and I wouldn't order that dessert again. So 4/5 stars but I will be back.",

Anyways, the location is awesome, as the downtown summerlin mall continues to grow, everyone loves Mexican food . So, the location was a no brainer. I personally, could see this place as one of my new happy hour spots. One of those places that could be, \"the place\", this could be it.   So, me and my friend come to eat here after I tell her I ve been waiting for this place to open, I call and found out this place just opened !   The ambiance and architecture are beautiful. When you go inside, you feel like you went on a vacation, it doesn't feel like the Las Vegas desert anymore ! It feels tropical and the glass windows add something new and inviting !   We got free champagne and the lobster taco s were amazing ! My friend's breakfast she said was just ok! Breakfast may not be their speciality !   I love the place so far . I d say to lower prices somewhat and add more marketing and incentives for happy hour and ladies' night . In addition, they did say they do karaoke and play music. The bar area is huge ! I ll be back otherwise !",

Two tables came in reviewed menu and I heard them also talking about the high prices. The lowest thing is a plain burrito at 13.95.  So - they started sending out coupons 2 for 1 for dinners but there's s catch.. you have to order two drinks. Watch it a simple soda is 3.75 each! Lol so u really get 8.50 off of highly expensive meals. Really only 50% off your second meal.   Lower ur prices your not that great of food  and I was around people not coming back again.",

I don't know if his Pancho's is affiliated with a location that was once in My hometown of Houston, TX but I decided to bring my dad here. Everyone seemed to have loved the food they had chosen. I had eaten my full plate before I even knew it (within 15mins if receiving it). I believe we all either got some type of enchilada or burrito. I was the only one who ordered an adult beverage and tried the cucumber-jalapenos margarita. I initially was going to get the regular jalapeno margarita but the server said this other one was better. Unfortunately, the taste of the cucumber completely took away the spicy kick of the margarita. I was disappointed with it being a Mexican restaurant. To be fair, maybe because Houston, TX is the best place to get your authentic Mexican food and really delicious cocktails. We live our margaritas frozen, and I've only found one place that actually makes a stellar frozen margarita here in Vegas. I would advise not to get the cucumber jalapeno margarita- just stick to the plain jalapeno margarita instead. Besides the good food, I think the entree's were priced almost $2 too high. I definitely would go again if ever I find a date to have dinner with",

Had to wait about 15 minutes for a table so we went to the bar for a beer and a margarita. $18.95 for 2 drinks, ok a little pricey which now pushed my expectations to a higher level. We both had soup, the Albondigas and their Chicken Tortilla soup were both very good, hot and flavorful. Our entrees were Carnitas Ramon and the Artichoke and Avocado burrito. portions were huge and both dishes were very good. The carnitas was very very lean. Over all the food was plentiful, and delicious. Our server was very polite and helpful. Besides being a little pricey we enjoyed our experience and will be back.",

The sauces on both dishes were complex yet subtle. Of course we ordered Tres leche cake for dessert which arrived with great birthday fanfare in honor of my friend.

The manager Doug saw that one of our dishes was a little too spicy for my girlfriend and instantly came over to exchange it just to ensure we were both happy with our meals.  He was extremely kind and funny. (Awesome glasses by the way.) Jorge, our waiter, was great!!!  I highly recommend this place. We will definitely be back thanks to the amazing service here!!",

    "text": "One of the most incredible parts of this beautiful place is knowing it was a parking lot a mere 6 months ago! The interior of the space is amazing! Truly transformative.  I had heard through the local grapevine they were having some opening bumps, and had decided to wait a bit to let them work it out. When recently invited to meet friends here for dinner, I thought it was perfect timing.  Right off the bat, you are greeted with big smiles, polite staff across the board. Our waiter was awesome. All of that is perfect.   So now you are asking....sounds great, why only 3 stars? The reason for 3 stars is the food was really super mediocre.  And I wanted it to be great! But, sadly it was definitely not.  On top of being completely average, it was very expensive compared to other mexican places of this food caliber. I had an enchilada and a chili relleno, and it was just shy of $20. I could easily list 10 places that are close to 1/2 that price and better food. I suspect this is why the online menu does not have any pricing. Most people in the area will know that it is high. My sentiment regarding the food was the census at the table, no one was thrilled.  Don't get me wrong, I have NO ISSUE with a $20 entree! If the food is amazing, that is all I need to know! But here, the food is far from amazing. Bummer, because it is really a beautiful space, filled with an awesome staff!",

It was so hard to choose something to eat and not hurt my pocket! I just chose the meatball soup! It was delicious but for the portion and the price it wasn't worth the 7.95! It was my friends birthday so the staff came to our table, put a sombrero and sang for him! They also provided fried ice cream and a shot of tequila! That was pretty fun! The overall experience was really nice! I would come back if they would lower the prices.. But I doubt they would so I may not be back unless have to!",

To be honest, it's very basic and plain for the price. I know several restaurants that are way cheaper and the food is flavorful.  Other than price, it's a nice restaurant.",

Also, the decor and ambiance was fantastic. That's where it gets 2 stars.   The food was just not good. I got the chicken fajitas thinking it was nice and basic. How could you go wrong? Dry chicken, spices that made it taste horrible, brown guacamole and dry rice. Very high priced and a chain restaurant like Chili's leaves it in the dust, which is a shame.   My friend's meal wasn't much better.   This place has potential to be awesome. They have great service from the minute you walk in until the minute you leave. The restaurant itself is beautiful. But the food needs a lot of work for how much you're spending.   Honestly, greasy Roberto's or some of the small taco stands have better food. It's very disappointing.",

The ambiance was fun and the service was great.  I couldn't wait to take my husband there especially since he tasted my leftovers and LOVED it so we went the next day... yes, the very next day. Which where this rating comes in... the food tasted NOTHING like the day before.. the salsa was watery and weak. The taquitos were bland and the green salsa was... flavorless. The service was still great but the food was such a disappointment. Upside is that they are True to their word, they make everything fresh. Downside, their chefs are very inconsistent so much so that I will never eat at Pancho's again. Why? because you should never have to pay that much money for disappointing food.",

Tried the fish by itself and it was good but once you add the sides, lemon, and sauce then the taco was really good! The rice was decent and the beans were ok. They melted the cheese on the beans I believe with a torch, like you would with the sugar on creme brulee. The chips were of medium thickness, not greasy, and the salsa was pretty good. One of the waiters offered us a free refill on chips and salsa which was a plus. I've read comments where a bowl of fruit is also complimentary but we didn't get any. Might have been a special or grand opening thing. Lastly, they added a nice little touch to the tacos. They pinned the tacos closed with a strip of bamboo (I believe) shaped into a sword (tied a knot at one end) and used radishes as stoppers. Check out the pic!  As for the decor, gorgeous! Just look at the pictures other people have uploaded. There is a nice little outdoor waiting area that is very charming. Slightly hidden and intimate. I looked at the colorful patterned tiles that were everywhere and from I can tell they are all hand painted or else stamped but none were completely identical. We were a table away from the fountain and didn't smell \"mold\" like what one person said in review. We walked by it and I took a whiff and didn't smell a thing. We did however get one of the two tables that is right next to the kitchen entrance. It was busy and kind of distracting but luckily no accidents this evening. The \"uniforms\" of the hostess' were a nice touch, subtle Mexican styled dresses.   I would definitely come back but not as often due to the prices. This would be a great place to take friends and family for dinner due to the \"WOW\" factor of the decor. By far the coolest looking Mexican cuisine restaurants I've been to. Looking forward to trying the flan next time, it looks similar to how my mom makes them.",

We felt that the food should have been more than mediocre for the price. Kids plates are $10 and adult plate average around $20. My husband and I ordered signature dishes since they all had enticing descriptions on the menu. The food was beautifully presented and the serving size was more than adequate but the taste failed to live up to expectations. This is not a place I would recommend due to the high price for lackluster food.",

    "text": "We had a coupon for a buy one meal get one free so decided to try it. Sitting in the atrium area is nice, but if you sit anywhere else it's very plain. Food prices were double compared to other restaurants in town (Ricardo's, Jalisco's etc.) Was surprised and disappointed they didn't serve Horchata. Their normal salsa was heavy on the garlic. Service and food were just ok, nothing spectacular. I've had better Mexican food at other places. Would I go back...probably not.",

    "text": "I'm from California so I'm extremely selective about the Mexican restaurants I go to and give my endorsement. Pancho's from its inception here in Downtown Summerlin has definitely earned its endorsement from me. The atmosphere is amazing, the service is great, generally the manager is always walking around--checking in and making sure everyone is comfortable. They have live entertainment and karaoke nights in the bar area on some nights...oh yeah, and the food is amazing. I've tried several things here, the burrito ranchero is probably my favorite dish. If you're a die hard beef burrito fan...you can't go wrong with that selection. If you're looking to have a great nite out with your friends and in you're in the mood for Mexican food--do yourself a favor and come to Pancho's...just as a side note...the price points are a little higher than most of the Mexican restaurants I've gone to, but just know it's worth it!",

    "text": "I gave one star because the bus boy was very nice and attentive and the restaurant decor was adorable.  However everything else was horrid!  Let's start with the unfriendly and borderline snarky hostess.  I didn't get her name, but she had dark brown hair.  The restaurant is lit so darkly at the tables that you can barely see your food.  Which is probably what they intended so you can't see the horrible presentation of the plates.  I ordered the 2 cheese enchilada combo.  The enchiladas had so much cheese on top of them that that's all I could taste.  The rice was hard and not at all like any Mexican or Spanish rice that I've ever had.  How can you possibly serve awful Mexican rice at a Mexican restaurant?  My meal was under $20, which is completely overpriced!  My friend wasn't that hungry so she ordered a side of beans and rice.  The serving she got was baby sized and was $6.  My daughter ordered from the kid's meal a cheese quesadilla.  The kid's meal was $10 for a tiny quesadilla and hard rice.  Let me say that she's had better at Taco Bell.  The tortillas were hard as rocks on her quesadilla.  The flan I ordered for dessert was ok, but was drenched in cinnamon.  I've had Mexican food in many places, even in Mexico.  I've been to taquerias that were amazing and sad to say that I'd rather go to Taco Bell than ever return to this place.  The price point at this place does not match the quality of the food or the service.  The waiter was barely present until I asked our bus person if he could bring my dessert.  We were done with our plates a while, and our server never came back to ask if we were ready for dessert or how our meal was.  He did however bring us the check, and after picking it a back up he opened it right in front of me to see how much tip he received.  How completely rude and unprofessional!  He was a jerk period.  I don't mind paying this price for good food and good service, but this restaurant has neither of those things.  I will NEVER return to this overpriced restaurant with rude service and disgusting food.",

Alfredo was our waiter and he was absolutely incredible. The best service we have had in Las Vegas and we have lived here for 9 years. We will come back to Panchos and we will be asking for Alfredo!

The servings sizes were perfect and the food came quickly and was fresh.  I HIGHLY recommend the brunch menu.  The Huevos Rancheros were AMAZING and I can't wait to go back and have them again!  Miguel took fantastic care of us.  I will ask for him by name next time.",
