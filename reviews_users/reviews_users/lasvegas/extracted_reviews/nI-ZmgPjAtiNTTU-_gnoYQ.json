    "text": "Good tasting food that I'll probably never taste again as I don't want to subject my family to that poor of service. I don't necessarily think that the place has bad service overall, for I witnessed our server take great care of the tables around us - offered fresh pepper, cheese, refills, dessert, etc. None were offered to us, we had to chase her down for refills and remind her the kids meal came with dessert. But what really puzzled me was the portion size of my entree. My linguine with clams entree was smaller than my 2 year old's spaghetti from the kids menu. Both served in the same bowl that's only slightly bigger than the small bread plate. We were excited to try their dessert but we never got that far. I normally base my reviews mostly on the taste of food and just explain my experience with service and ambiance, but the service was just THAT bad.",

    "text": "Their food is very good. They provide a complimentary plate with cheese, olives and peppers for a small starter. After, they give garlic knots (which are only ok. Not the best I've ever had, but still yummy. Besides, they're free.) I ordered a pasta & a pizza. The baked ziti was FANTASTIC! I really enjoyed the sauce, and it's very very cheesy. I had the Salame Picante Pizza, which was also very good. The crust is really why it was fantastic. It's a thin crust pizza, but not super crispy and hard to eat. The olives are definitely fresh, italian olives. Unfortunately, the food does not make this place worth going to. For a 75 dollar dinner (for two people) I expect MUCH more.   The reason I'm not giving it 4 or 5 stars is because of the atmosphere, lack of unprofessionalism, and the manager. Our server, who was from North Carolina, did well. No complaints there. My complaint is mostly in regards to the open kitchen and the manager, Dan, who truly does not care at all. With an open kitchen, you must teach your cooks how to behave. When I sit down in front of an open kitchen, I have zero desire to listen to the cooks personal music blasting from their phones. If you're gonna have an open kitchen, you should probably tell your cooks that if theres guests sitting four feet away, the music restaurant should suffice.   Something else that was frustrating was having the football game on. I personally don't care that the football game was on - especially since it's the beginning of the season. What I do mind is when you allow your staff to walk around yelling \"TOUCHDOWN!\" Again, there are guests here. I paid 75 dollars to eat my dinner in a nice restaurant, not buffalo wild wings.  LASTLY, my biggest issue of all - the manager Dan. When I expressed my concerns, Dan just stood there. After about 30 seconds, he says \"I'll address it.\" Not a \"Im sorry. You're right, that's not acceptable.\" Nothing. I already paid my bill, I had zero intention of a comped item. But Dan is by far the most lack luster, uncaring manager ever. Perhaps Trattoria Regiano in Venetian holds their staff to a higher standard than this location.  In sum, If you're going to Downtown Summerlin and are looking for a nice meal - go anywhere else. You'll actually enjoy the atmosphere of Shake Shack better.",

The bread in the basket which came with the meal was soft and delightful. I really regretted leaving it behind, since we were traveling we couldn't take leftovers with us. My dining companion ordered the sea bass and loved it, it was prepared exactly the way he likes it. Our server was lovely and very attentive. I almost passed by this restaurant thinking a meal downtown would not be so great but I'm so glad we didn't. It turned out to be the best meal of our trip and I would highly recommend Trattoria Reggiano.",

    "text": "The food here was ok, nothing to write home about.  We had a large party and we got several different items.  The biggest problem I had is why I'm giving them 2 stars - their bartender apparently doesn't know what Blue Moon (the original wheat) is.  They had both the regular wheat on the menu and the \"seasonal\", which is a white IPA.  I told him that I wanted the original Blue Moon, to which he proceeded to argue with me telling me that Blue Moon IS an IPA. He said that they'd been getting people complaining because they thought it wasn't an IPA.  That's because it is most definitely not!!  He assured me that it was the regular Blue Moon so I ordered one.  It was the seasonal.  I didn't want to argue with him any further so I just let it go and someone else at the table drank it.    I hope that management will take this review into account and train their staff about the difference here.  This isn't an uncommon beer and most places carry it, so for it to taste like a completely different type of beer means that either your lines are mixed up or your staff doesn't know what they're serving.  If you're out of the regular that's fine, but don't try to tell me that something I've been drinking for over 6 years is something that it's not!  Please see my picture for proof of what I'm referring to.",

Three workers were outside conversing with one another and did not acknowledge us. We spoke to who we assume as the host who told us to proceed to the bar for to go orders. The bartender was nowhere in sight. When she got back to the bar she did not notice me standing in front of the pizza box that was mine. She started grabbing glasses and assumed I wanted a drink but I told her I had a to go order. She roughly throws the bill on top of the pizza box to give to me and then immediately walks away to take an order of a table far away from the bar top. She spends longer than normal taking their order as I glared her down. I've had my credit card on hand since before she got to the bar so there was no wait in me giving her my card. She scans it and sets it down and proceeds to help other customers again! Needless to say, this to go order took as long as a dine in order. We could have finished our pizza in the time it took to wait for her to ring us up so we could leave. Terrible service at the bar. That woman deserves to be fired. Shorter brunette curly haired older woman. Rude and unapologetic. She is the sole reason we will never return even tho the food was decent and the phone call went normally.",

We had he house specialty pasta which came with a red sauce, sundried tomatoes, and spinach, as well as the gnocchi in a vodka sauce. Both pastas were delicious and fresh but extremely bland, with not much going on besides the pasta and sauce. I guess that's normal for good Italian but I usually enjoy busier dishes. The bread, garlic knots, were actually quite good and I devoured 2, especially dipping in the entree sauces. We were finally given a complimentary olive and pepper dish to start out that was just par. Drinks are expensive and not very good to be frank. I ordered a Manhattan and it was just alcohol thrown into a glass, with no real craft. The house wine is $11 and truly is a house wine. Meal came to around a surprisingly expensive $70. Not worth the cost in my opinion with service underwhelming as well. But nonetheless a strip type of restaurant in downtown Summerlin.",

When the food came, I was surprised to find out that my chicken was breaded. I don't understand why they would give me breaded chicken with gluten free pasta. The waiter never came back after that, so I tried to take off the bread unsuccessfully and ended up giving the rest of my chicken to my son. He got the linguine with shrimp pasta with a watered down sauce that he said was disgusting. $85 later, I feel like I was robbed and have a stomach ache.

This is what I want when sitting at the bar. The kale salad was fabulous, as was the pizza. Last time we were here the Bolognese and calamari was fabulous. The food is outstanding, but Ricki is horrible. If you hate your job, stay home!",

    "text": "Should have left when we sat down to notice the silverware was dirty and bread plates not clean.  Appetizer of eggplant rotini was actually good but the rest was mediocre.  Arugula with cherry tomato salad was a generous pile of arugula but only 5 halves of under ripe cherry tomatoes.  The waiter recommended the baked ziti with meatballs.  It was swimming in cheese and didn't have much sauce.  That was probably a good thing since the sauce it did have was on the sweet side.  The meatballs with it were bland but ok.  Hubby is a chicken parm addict but he barely touched what they served him, also because the sauce was sweet.  Wine list has nothing under $40.  The wines they have are marked up four times retail.  They were out of the first two bottles we ordered.  The Meomi we buy for $17 in the store is $15/glass or $55/bottle.  Ferrari Cab was $55 too.  Over-priced for a casual spot like this.  We won't go back.",

    "text": "Great service from Ricki, even better food. Be sure to order the calamari. The garlic knots hint at how good their pizza must be. Penne ala vodka had a great, subtile guiancale flavor to it. The Linguine with the white clam sauce was perfectly seasoned in a slightly thick bodied sauce of deep complexity. The clams, in shell, were ocean fresh, impeccably clean and plentiful. The linguine was prepared perfectly al dente. Service was like a light breeze, barely noticeable, but just there and appreciated. Consider re training your hostess, as we requested a quiet table and she attempted to seat us in front of the restroom!",

Recently they added live music, which, in my opinion makes the dining experience worse.  The musicians are pretty old, have way too much hair dye, and sing songs that attracts an older crowd.  The sad part is that after a while, the sixty-somethings begin to dance, and let everyone know how drunk they are.  Hopefully they can trim down the number of nights that they have live music.",

I now realize that that was filled with tourists, most likely one-time only patrons. The food here was kind of flat and monotonous. The marinara sauce is bland. This is a beautiful restaurant if a bit pretentious. I get a sense that this place is run by a heavy-handed egotistical owner or manager that cannot see-through to its problems. I watched the management while I was dining here, and they seemed stern and unaccommodating. Our waiter was very friendly, almost too much so. I will probably try it again, just in case I was there on a bad day. All in all however, I was disappointed.",

I pointed it out to the waiter, who replaced it, and also had it taken off the bill.  The replacement was ok, but not flavorful enough to bring me back.  I truly wonder if the food quality is dependent on who is in the kitchen.  The reviews go from 5 stars to \"blah\". I also ordered the kale peanut salad which was too acidic for my taste.  The two stars are only for the waiter, \"Giovanni\" who I would give five stars, but I don't want anyone to think it is for the food.  I think management needs to do a better job on what leaves the kitchen and goes to the table.",

The complimentary garlic knots are to die for, and the other appetizers were great. Next was the service, literally the BEST service I've had in forever! They seated us immediately, attended us just as fast, and the main food courses came out in less than 20 min. They were all extremely friendly and courteous. All of the staff personally greeted us throughout the meal and made sure we were doing fine (it was my first time even entering the restaurant). The ambiance was great as well. Very romantic for a date and the lighting and atmosphere was delightful. We got to hear live music and the tables have crayons and a sheet of parchment over the table cloth for drawing too! For dinner for two the pricing was very reasonable as well. I recommend this place to all of the people I know",

My friend and I split a lunch and our first course was the Italian kale salad which was more than ample for two people and chock-full of all the ingredients mentioned on the menu.  It was a wee bit overdressed for my taste but still delicious. We then enjoyed the eggplant parm which was very lightly breaded, sauteed and then topped with a hint of marinara sauce and finished off with melted mozzarella and served with a side of Al Dente spaghetti with marinara sauce. We couldn't resist dessert and it's a good thing because we ordered the cannoli which was freshly assembled per order. The filling was amazing; creamy and flavorful and decorated with chocolate chips, yummy.  I would like to return for dinner sometime soon.",

I only tried the meatballs and caprese salad, neither of which  were remarkable in the least.   For my entree I decided to steer clear of the pastas and pizzas and offered the salmon with vegetables.

The whole table heard me ask for shrimp scampi since they had to come back to take my order, except our server so when the food came out I stared at it and thought these are either mighty big shrimp (the menu did say jumbo shrimp) or I got chicken. I ask the server to double check and said server apologized and insisted in making it right. It came out in 6 min. It was fast. I got 6 jumbo shrimp...maybe I should've told them to take their time and cook it for 12 minutes (to get 12 shrimp).  Shrimp was fine but it was overpowered by this stuffing placed on top which was salty and totally out of place. The shrimp was simply overpowered in this case.  The appetizers of calamari and cheese and olives were very good though. The mozzarella pizza was ok but it certainly is no Grimaldis or even Pieology. Yes, I would gladly take the pieology pizza. The pizza is thin slice but the tomato flavor is not there. It can use more sauce or tomato paste. The next day when I reheated it it was soggy due to to much water from the cheese. The lobster ravioli was very good.  It does not stack up against the middle ground Cheesecake Factory in my view. The service is friendly but lacking. For $300 for a group of 7 (not including the bar tab) it was nothing to write home about. Very disappointed as the place looked like a really nice place.",

It looked really nice inside and because of our Italian craving, we found this spot to be something new to try. The food was presented wonderfully, but the taste just doesn't match its good looks.  To be honest, this was nothing special. Their food, for the prices that they were, didn't seem to really be worth it. My pasta was mediocre, our pizza was as well.   I think the one thing that stood out was the really friendly customer service from our server for the evening. She was very attentive and accommodating. While we waited for our food she brought us out a little tray of cheeses and olives to snack on.   I don't think we'll find ourselves here again, but it wasn't a bad place. Would I recommend this to anyone else? No, because it wouldn't be the first Italian restaurant to cross my mind, BUT if someone were to ask me if they should eat there, I don't think I would try and dissuade them.",

It has outdoor seating but since it's winter we opted to sit inside. There is a bar inside and as well as an open kitchen.  I started with a glass of wine. The waiter was very helpful in picking a glass of wine. I told him I was ordering penne al vodka and he suggested a red pinot. It was a great pairing! The pasta was also good.  Dessert was, of course, my favorite. We ordered tiramisu and it was the best tiramisu I have ever had. If you order dessert you must try this one.  The prices were moderate. Not overly expensive but not cheap. The service was good but we did have to wait a little while at the end of the check. Overall a good experience. My pick for best Italian in downtown Summerlin.",

I felt claustrophobic and it was uncomfortable to talk because the tables on each side of us could clearly listen in on our conversation. We might as well have all been at one big table together, that's how close we were. They need to spread things out a bit more if they want their ambiance to be better.  Stop trying to squeeze so many people in!  The food was pretty good, I told the waiter I wanted a pepperoni pizza and it came out smothered in kalamata olives and pepperoni ( I absolutely HATE olives!) Not sure why they did that...I did'nt want to complain in front of my date so I just picked them off but all I could taste was olives  :/  Pasta fagioli soup was decent, not the best I've had in the city.

I love that they allow you to bring your own bottles of wine (for a small pour fee) adds a fun personal touch to the dinning experience. The appetizers and entrees all around the table were on point, well seasoned, excellent portion size and absolutely delicious! This place will definitely be our go-to when in the mood for Italian!",

It tries hard but falls short. They do offer complimentary garlic bread and an antipasto plate. The cheese on the plate was not good at all. The olives were eh, and the canned roasted peppers were just that....canned...or jarred..whatever. Not fresh made. So, as much as I enjoy free stuff, I like free stuff thats good. I'd pass on the antipasto next time. There were 8 of us so we tried a bunch of stuff. I really enjoyed the eggplant rolatini, that was so good. The calmari were OK, but I didn't think the meatballs were great the way people raved about them. I ordered the fruit de mare pasta dish. It was alright. I'd try something else next time if I decided to come back. We had a couple of bottles of the sangria (half price during happy hour), and we enjoyed that.  I'm a HUGE fan of eggplant rolatini, and theirs was good, so if I did come back, it would be for that. Service was alright. Cost was what you'd expect for Summerlin. Oh, be mindful of prices. They differ from menu to menu.",

My family and I eat here quite often.  We love the food and the service.  I don't know what place the writer was in but this restaurant doesn't have 15 people working on any shift.  When the lady fell, the bartender (who was an EMT) immediately rushed to her.  At the same time, one of the servers was doing exactly what she should by calling mall security.  The \"gentleman\" really didn't have to do anything since the staff was very knowledgeable about the appropriate actions to take and took them.   I very seldom write anything on Yelp, but I do read reviews of places we want to try.  It really bothers me when someone writes inaccurate reviews.  That is not to say that things can't be wrong at times with food and service. However, let's at least be honest.  The food at this restaurant is not New York Italian, but rather, True Italian from Italy.  It is authentic and excellent.  The servers, bartenders, and manager are always helpful, polite, and accommodating.    I have tried to correct an injustice by explaining the event and stating our enjoyment every time we dine here.",

The calamari was pretty good, pizza was good and the veal was just meh. There was an odd taste to the sauce on the veal and the veal wasn't as tender as I'm used to. The real reason for the low review is based on the price. If you're going to charge nearly $40 for a plate of pasta then the dish had better be spectacular. Our meal was $75 for two entrees and an appetizer (we drank water) and the food was anything but special. I can't see coming back with those prices to try anything else.",

We visited this establishment again this week and probably had the best eggplant appetizer . Perfectly cooked covered in delicious red gravy and cheese .

The garlic bread is amazing, hot, buttery, soft...so good. The tortellini are delicious as well, clearly handmade and full in flavor. Even, their meatball dish comes dangerously close to Raio's most iconic item. But by far the best thing to order here is dessert, particularly the ricotta cake and cannoli.

We had the Calamari, Chicken Parm, and Eggplant Parm, then Cannoli for dessert, all absolutely delicious. Complimentary glass of Champagne with our dessert. A live singer was performing right below the TV, which had sports on, so both me and my boyfriend were very pleased with the entertainment. Wonderful, romantic evening!",

    "text": "I think it all started out on a bad note and there wasn't a recovery during our visit.   Asking guests to wait outside until a table inside is ready (aka 108 degrees) while there is only 1 other table of 4 seated in the restaurant (should have been my first clue) is a bad start. Being pressured to order= I really hate that. It was my first time here,  I needed some time. I was also confused why the host is asking for my order minutes after we sat down? If your host is going to take orders, they should know the specials of the day! Alright, so that was an awkward start...  They bring Garlic knots that are generous and appear very appetizing. Overly greasy, soggy in olive oil, a raw garlic flavor; lighter on the oil and some nice crisp on the bread would be a big improvement.  Fella ordered the meatball sandwich (comes with fries); I went with a Caesar salad because I was already suspicious. (AKA: servers and line cooks talking about their dates last night loudly by my table in a big empty restaurant, doesn't make me feel like kitchen is strong on their game). Our food arrived so quickly I was surprised and a little suspicious (microwave?); the cheese appeared oddly coagulated, melted but not bubbly like a nice toasted meatball sam.  The salad- flavorful dressing but overdressed and I wasn't a fan of the full anchovy presented on top. Top it off- last bite was a sour tomato. Trying to eliminate that flavor from my mouth, I took some fries from my fella's dish, and sure enough the oil had a strange taste. I couldn't get the strange oil taste of my palette from these fries.   My favorite things from the experience were the fresh flowers on the table and the Andes mint that finally neutralized the weird fry oil taste.",

We were really pressed for time and our server Bethany went the extra mile to expedite our meal. She topped it off with a considerate lighted cannoli to celebrate my wife's birthday. We will definitely return here on our next trip to Vegas. If you are willing to drive a little ways off the strip, this restaurant is well worth the trip. The places near the strip are over-priced and commercial, not to mention mostly terrible! I'm Italian and have traveled to Italy a few times in recent years. I would put Trattoria Reggiano at par with any place in Italy for taste and authenticity. Friendly and fabulous. Try it!!",

The party I went with all got different entrees from the menu and we shared them. Everything was good, and we couldn't agree which entree was the best. I loved the pasta a la vodka, my wife loved the linguini Bolognese, and my brother loved the tortellini alfredo. Bottom line it was all great. Be careful though, I highly recommend saving room for dessert. The cheesecake is one of the best I've ever had, and the tiramisu was delicious. On top of all of this or server made great recommendations, was extremely friendly, and made us excited to return again. The manager introduced herself to us and chatted with us for a minute. It was a wonderful dining experience and I can't wait to come back and try more items from the menu.",

    "text": "A trattoria is an Italian-style eating establishment, less formal than a ristorante, but more formal than an osteria. There are generally no printed menus, the service is casual, wine is sold by the decanter rather than the bottle, prices are low, and the emphasis is on a steady clientele rather than on haute cuisine.  The above is Wikipedia's definition of a trattoria.  Some of it fits what we experienced at Downtown Summerlin Reggiano.  I'll start with the positive.  At the end of our ordeal Danny the manager refused our payment with apologies.  It would have been about $200. I did tip accordingly.  It was a birthday celebration and our small party of three chose to try something new that a trusted friend raved about, Trattoria Reggiano.  We had reservations and we were seated promptly.  But I should have guessed what was to come when our table, covered with the traditional sheet of meat wrapper, came with a can of crayons.  Our attentive server (Dan, not the manager) was prompt and pleasant. He brought menus which are printed with impossibly small print.  He took our drink orders (wine, martini and water) and soon returned with a basket of the wonderful garlic buns.  Fifteen minutes later, still no beverages.    We were seated near the bar and I could see the person behaving like a bartender wondering about the trattoria, bussing tables and socializing with the foursome at the table next to ours.  I could also see Dan giving her furtive glances to see where the drink order was.  He feared returning to our table because he knew we would also ask.  In the meantime a woman brough her very young daughter to the bar area and said, \"Wouldn't you like to sit on the stool that (famous Golden Knights hockey player) sat in the other night?\"  Hey, isn't there a law prohibiting minors from sitting in a bar area?  As a bartender or manager I would be nervous about risking my permit over such an infraction, I don't care if you are the Duchess of Summerlin.  In the meantime the bussers would come around the corner with a load of dirty dishes, silverware and glasses which then would be unceremoniously dumped with an accompanying cacophony of disturbing noise.  I'm European and I can tell you that such behavior in Italy would have been the cause of immediate dismissal of that employee.  Finally, Dan came over, apologized for the slow cocktail service and pressed the barmaid to produce our order.  The water came first followed soon by the glass of wine and my martini.  I ordered a martini up.  It was in a stemmed glass, but it had ice cubes in it.  Hello?????  I passed it off as sloppy pouring and said nothing.  By this time we had put in our entree order and waited...and waited...and waited.  I ordered another martini.  It was served identically only with more ice cubes.  Not the way I have ever had a chocolate espresso martini.  More than an hour after entering the premises it occurred to me that the can of crayons were there to help pass the time.  Maybe some doodling, hangman, anything to take our minds of our growling tummies.  I must say that the food is prepared in generous proportions.  Our order included a Caesar Salad and Dan advised wisely, that one order would feed two and offered to split it on two plates.  It came on one and we did the honors.  My pasta dish with meatballs lasted two additional meals after take out.  The food was slightly on the bland side.  In the meantime, I observed Dan and the other working server (only two for the whole place).  He was quite industrious working his tables but the holdup in the kitchen made that a challenge.  His serving associate however, was another story.  She would disappear for lengthy periods.  Twice I watched her go out the front door to talk on her cell phone while customers were waiting for service.  I'm assuming she was mining for another job.  After nearly two hours we just wanted to get out of there and none of us finished our food.  Took awhile to wave down Dan for the check and the to go containers.  He apologized for the slow service and we acknowledged his apology by briefly expressing our disappointment.  He asked if \"The Birthday Boy\" would be interested in a dessert.  This was the fourth time he used that moniker with me and my 71-year-old child within was about ready to bop him one.  I just said, \"no\".  Soon after Danny the manager came back with our check and  acknowledging that they had staffing issues.  He assured me when I asked that my drinks should not have been served over ice.  When it was obvious that even when offered a free meal we would never be back, he withdrew the check.  Kudos to him.  There are too many good places in this town to put up with that kind of service.",

I'm dining alone and enjoying listening to the live music ... someone comes takes drink order and then takes food order. I order a Caesar no tomatoes ... get my salad and notice there are no crouton or anchovies on my salad. am told well they saw no tomatoes and figured you didn't want anything else !?  Interesting I ask if he wants to take my salad to get them to toss my salad says no I'll bring the other items on the side and you can put them on yourself . and well ok then.  As I'm eating the salad I essentially made for myself. someone asks if they can have a seat from my table - mind you there are other empty tables in the area - You know what ... sure why not ... server came to my table a total of 4 times ... 2 of those times were to bring croutons and then the anchovies - yes separate trips .. best thing about my meal was the cocktail .. they made a perfect cosmopolitan . the pink sauce on the lobster ravioli was good ... really flavorful and actually overpowers the lobster... but I would still rate the dish a 3 out of 5  overall a lackluster experience ... I would consider maybe coming here again ... but I'm kind of torn ... it was a relatively slow Thursday night ...",

In the summer time the ambiance is even better as you can sit on the outside patio. The price point is reasonable, you can find several dishes priced from 18 to 40 dollars per plate.   They also have a large selection of items so there is not an issue finding anything you would like. The size portions were very generous, I would say most people would have a hard time finishing their plate. I ordered the Lobster Ravioli which was very good. There were large pieces of lobster all over the dish. The sauce was tasty and the ravioli was perfectly cooked.   If you are looking for a simple but tasty dish I would recommend this dish. Overall, the food was good but not memorable.",

The calamari smelled awful - too fishy. I wanted meat with my dish and they couldnt add it for extra. I had to buy meat balls on the side just to pair it with something. My friend's spaghetti and meat balls were plain sauce wise and my other friend's white wine pasta dish was not appetizing at all. Ended up spending almost $200 between the 3 of us. There was definitely nothing special about this place. I dont mind spending good money on quality italian but I think its more hype than anything else. Overall mediocre. I dont think Id come back again. Im usually not a complainer/nit picker but for someone who loves Italian food and doesnt mind forking out the money it was a big let down.",

    "text": "Cute patio with air!! I wish DT Summerlin wasn't such a concrete jungle- too hot even before summer has heated up. Good was quite tasty and service was good. Not sure about the free garlic knots with oil and balsamic for dipping? They were already pretty oily. Portions look small for lunch but don't be deceived, it was more than enough food but a little pricey for lunch. I had pasta with garlic, olive oil and cracked red pepper. The chef forgot to add the pepper and the waitress failed to notice so I had to ask for them to bring a shaker to the table. Simple flavors are an indicator of a chefs skill and the pasta was perfect and the sauce flavorful (can't believe they forgot an ingredient though). I'll definitely give them another chance- when summer is over ;)",

Good food, not cheap, but certainly a place to go back to. What made the evening complete and why we give this 5 stars was Danny, the waiter, who really did everything to make this perfect. From asking the chef to make some changes to a plate without butter but olive oil instead to giving recommendations and helping to clear the table. Great ! Keep this attitude Danny ! Fantastic.",

We were out and about shopping and my BF wanted something sweet, I was in support of a restaurant so I could have a glass of wine. The restaurant is very intimate, which I love!! They offer outdoor seating, another plus, plus a great happy hour. We decided to share the spaghetti and meatballs and let me tell you, hands down best meatballs in Vegas. My BF grew up in a very strict Italian family and he could not stop talking about how great the meatballs are. We have no desire to go to another Italian restaurant in Vegas. We of course got our something sweet in the end where my BF chose the Carrot Cake and I went for the Cannoli. Both were amazing!!!! Danny G. the manager helped me to decide to order the Cannoli since he was bragging about how good it is and that they make it fresh in house, SOLD!!! Danny G. was a delight who went over and beyond any expectations to make a casual stroll into dinner #2. Thank you all for a fabulous time!!",

We had chicken parmesan, baked ziti and meatballs. All were fantastic. Desert was great !  Finally found a good cannoli and Tiramisu. The price point is a little high, but the location has to be factored in.My only complaint is that my wife substituted whole wheat pasta and charged $2.oo without letting us know. I would pay , but just let me know.",

We were pleasantly surprised when they brought out garlic knots as their bread and an amuse bouche of Parmesan hunks, olives and roasted red pepper slices. I had to deliberately not fill up before my entree came out. I ordered the tortelloni and they were perfection. Delicate, flavorful perfection. I speculate that they hand make them because of how well they were cooked. My husband had the gnocchi and he thoroughly enjoyed that dish. We will definitely be back.

I didn't care if I wreaked of garlic or that I'd be sweating it out of my pores the next day, they were pretty damn good. As for the rest of the stuff I tried... meh. The menu is typical Italian-American food, the kind of stuff you'll see in a million other spots. Perfect for the non-adventurous eater -- the kind of diner who thinks not eating at a national chain is a bit risky.   The kitchen plays it safe and turns out unremarkable food. Meatballs ($14) made from a filet mignon and pork loin mixture were too hard and dense with a sauce that lacked depth. The small portion of the kale peanut salad ($8) was plenty to share, but the underdressed dish had me reaching for water to wash it down. The end of the meal took a turn for the better with a satisfying, but uninspired, lasagna ($22) with ground filet, ricotta, and mozzarella.  Kid menus are available as well. My son's spaghetti (ordered sans tomato sauce, just butter) was a sizable portion that he devoured. Each kid's meal comes with a beverage and mini cannoli.  Located steps away from the movie theater in Downtown Summerlin, it's a nice looking space with a large patio and a smaller than expected interior, with a bar and open kitchen. The food is more paint-by-numbers than Monet, but is just good enough to satisfy a suburban customer base used to eating recognizable Italian.  2.5 Stars",

I started my meal out with their steamed mussels, hot cheesy rolls and with oil and balsamic vinegar on the side. Then ordered their shrimp scampi, the shrimps were larger and cooked to perfection. The pasta tasted awesome with the lemon butter sauce.   They also have a bar where you can come just get a drink and watch a game or something.   The service was on point and they made sure you had everything you need, not pushy at all. Sonic your ever in Vegas and want some Italian food, I recommend you come here.",

While the service was good it was not as good as last time.  Last time they brought out a plate of cheese, roasted peppers and red, green and black olives that were fantastic.  This time there was only one of those green olives on the plate and when I asked the waiter for the more and for the other colors he found a few more green ones and said that was all there were which I find hard to believe.  Last time the garlic knots were wonderful.  This time they were very doughy and undercooked although very brown on top.  I had the same meal, baked ziti and while last time it was delicious this time I could hardly eat it.  The other meals were just ok.  Nothing to rave about like our last visit.  Towards the end of our meal they sat a very large party behind us although there really wasn't enough room and the waitress kept bumping into me every time she had to get through.  At one point she told me I needed to move my chair in.  If we were not getting ready to leave I definitely would have said something.  I also think that either the prices went up or they have a higher priced menu because it is during the holidays but I can tell you that we probably will not be going back there.",

Garlic knots were to die for, penne vodka was some of the best I've had-- smooth and silky sauce dente pasta. The Caesar was a little over dressed, but the dressing was good so I can't complain. Nice service.   The only thing I'd say is that for the Venetian the \"views\" aren't great. It's situated right near the food court adjacent to a gift shop. They did a nice job with the decor and adding some green shrubs to shield a bit. And the prices were very reasonable (all pastas were $15-$22, chicken parm $26, small Caesar $8) so for us the small tradeoff was worth it.   We will definitely be back if we are in Vegas again!",

But our server was very out of it. She seemed like she was doing us a favor by stopping by.  We had to ask for more water, coffee, etc.  She seemed put out when we wanted to look at the dessert menu.  Not sure if we will try again as it is somewhat of a drive and there are great Italian restaurants in the Henderson area.",

With this said, we had to ask multiple times for glasses of water and were told the long wait was due to not having enough glasses cleaned. Two of the five dinners were wrong and instead of redoing them they simply brought new incorrect sauce on the side. The bread was cold by the time we received it and half of it burnt. The live music was great but management has some work to do with service and good quality especially with the prices being so high.",

I will preface this by saying that I did not look specifically at the prices of the wine or the specifics of the happy hour specials. Our bill came to $60! Needless to say I was shocked. I could have gotten 4 bottles (of the same wine) at Costco for that price!! I really do love the atmosphere and have enjoyed their food in the past.  I would go back but definitely recommend checking out a corking fee or have your wine before you go!  The manager stated the pricing is related to the night rental on retail space at this complex.",

I came here on a Saturday evening. Surprisingly....parking was easy to find. I saw plenty of parking spaces in the lots AND in the garage.   I ordered the Linguine Bolognese-ground beef with some kind of tomato sauce, fresh herbs and spices, tossed with light Parmesan. It SOUNDS delicious but really, it was a let down. Wasn't very flavorful and tasted bland. Too much pasta but not even meat sauce. Also....this restaurant is pretty pricy for what it's really worth. $22 freakin dollars for my entree. If you want to add chicken, shrimp etc....it's like $6 extra. For this kind of price...I could have gotten a much better quality dinner at Bootlegger Bistro!! Ugh.... =/",

Of course we checked yelp and this place drew our attention. It looks rather small on the inside, there was a bar, and outside seating. It was a nice night so we decided to go with the outdoor tables. We got seated right away and the atmosphere was really nice. There was live music and the lady who was singing was awesome. She made the experience really fun and enjoyable. My sister and I wanted to share so we ordered the specialty salad and a pasta. The waitress brought us garlic knots to start, delicious and soft!!! Don't forget to dip it in the oil and vinegar. The salad came out right after and it was huge! Enough to feed three people. They also split the pasta into two bowls for us (how nice, we didn't even ask). The food was tasty we finished it all and it was very filling. We enjoyed this place very much.",

I personally think the chef in charge failed to make sure all was sent to the table properly. It is somewhat of a pricey place to eat in Las Vegas.  More than a neighborhood place.",

The average price of a mean is anywhere between 27-50 bucks, which is not bad for the quality of the meal. I give the chefs my props and respect because the service was quick and did not lack quality at all. I will be eating here again soon! My new favorite spot.

I ordered a dirty martini it didn't arrive dirty ( mistakes happen) I just wanted some olive juice on the side to mix in my martini, but Jason insisted on taking it back and getting it shaken again so it was cold again. All the food came out hot and in a timely manner. We ordered meatballs, calamari, Caesar salads, linguini with clams and it all was excellent. Some friends who live here took me here because they love it and I can see why. Even the bathrooms are sparkly clean. Our water, tea, and wine were never empty and we were always asked if we'd like more. He heard we were trying to go see the fireworks Red Rock was setting off, and Jason was very cognizant that we wanted to make it out by 9 and I really appreciated that. I have been in the restaurant industry for years and I truly appreciate how attentive and personable Jason was. He is an asset to your team, so please pass this message on for him. My friend ordered a very different kind of Caesar salad with a lot of modifications and it came out perfect. All the food tasted fresh and delicious and the garlic knots are to die for. Even the little things like sweenter wrappers were whisked away off the table before we even noticed they had disappeared. The restaurant is clean and the associates seem happy and it looks like there is a lot of teamwork and everyone helping everyone out. Thank you for an excellent meal I can still taste the garlic. I will be back ! Thank you TR!",

    "text": "First,we love this place,the food is phenomenal. My wife, ordered wine instead got champagne. But it was taking forever just to get water and some bread. So she just went with it. So we had to ask the hostess for bread. Because Andres took FOREVER, We were there for almost 2 hours. Never asked how our food was, we had to ask for refills when we did see our waiter Andres. We also had to ask the hostess for our check then that took over 20 mins just to get that. We are so disappointed, our girls didn't even get the cannolis that they usually get after there meals. On a side note the food was great. We watched people leave because no one ever came over to at least get there drink order. I don't know if we will be back, this was our favorite for Italian but maybe have to loom somewhere else.   So we went back today, and I cannot tell you what a wonderful experience we had. The food is always phenomenal, but the waiter and Wendy the general manager were awesome. This is still our favorite place for Italian food. We will be repeat customers for life. Thank you so much for the wonderful experience.",

With that being said I would give dining on the patio 2 stars at best. First of all, when I ask about bread and water and the server responds with \"the busser will bring that out soon\" you've already rubbed me the wrong way. Which by the way she brought out 2 minutes later.  The food is very mediocre and overpriced for what it is especially, with Grape Street being across the street at the same price and higher quality.  I had the bolognese- average. The man had what seemed to be a chicken breast and dry pasta couldn't even tell you the name of the dish.  We had to ask for our check and to-go boxes ourselves in an empty restaurant.  Should've just cooked at home.",

We asked them to hold it for us and if we could pick it up afterwards. They kept it under the heater for us and the manager came by and offered us a $100 gift card for the inconvenience. It was our fault for not telling them we were going to a movie but the manager took it upon himself to accept responsibility. How amazing!

    "text": "The 4 star rating is for the food, service was more of a mixed bag.  But, let's start with the positive.  The food was spot on and really nice for a casual, relaxed neighborhood place.  The garlic rolls are some of the best I've had in town.  For some reason, most of the garlic knots I've tried here in Vegas have not been up to par.  These are the exception.  They're soft and have that stretch and bounce of a good knot, garlicky with olive oil and a sprinkle of Parmesanm and served with extra bottles of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Margarita pizza with burrata was excellent, Caesar salad was tasty with dressing on the vinegary side, kids meals were decent and each meal came with a mini cannoli for dessert.  Meatballs looked great but didn't try. I would absolutely come back for the food.  Ok, here's the scoop on the service.  I think we just had an overworked server that day and that person was not at their best.  I prefer to give them the benefit of e doubt bc we all have our bad days.  Suffice it to say, service and attitude were subpar but not enough to complain to management.   In the end, we just wanted to pay our bill and move along.  The hostess and manager were very nice and courteous and greeted everyone at the door.  Conclusion:  food's great but the waitstaff could use a bit more training.  We'll be back to try again.",

We both agree we will not go back but it was okay for a last minute lunch. $77 before tip for two people. No salad with the meal.  We are Italian, rarely go out for Italian food as it is hard to  find authentic/really good food around here. Can honestly say this is no better than Olive Garden. Olive garden is less expensive and the food is the same quality",

Our server was right on, checked on us and knew when to leave us to enjoy. She was awesome! I'm very picky with Italian, this was the best we've had in the area.

    "text": "This is a nice Italian restaurant in Downtown Sumerlin. I have eaten here at least 6 times since they opened. Sometimes it's just me and my wife, and other times with our (grown) kids. When it's just the two of us, we usually start with the calamari. I'm not a big fan of calamari, but at this restaurant, I make an exception. I've tried the calamari at Red Lobster, and thought I was chewing a pencil eraser. The calamari here was better than any other I have tried. I actually finished the large portion (I did have help from my wife).  If we go with the kids, we will oder the antipasto platter. Yes, it is pricey, but it's a generous size, and the quality of the meats is first rate. I'm pretty sure the prosciutto is imported from Italy.    For my main course, I seem to be stuck on the salmon. I really like their spaghetti with meat sauce, and the veal parm is awesome, but the salmon does it for me.  It is always tender, juicy, and flavorful.  It even tastes good the next day for lunch, when I can't finish it at the restaurant because I ate too much calamari or antipasto.  Oh yeah, if you have room, the carrot cake is awesome. Get three or four friends to help you finish it.    I see in a couple of reviews people were complaining about slow service. In all the times I've been here, I have not had that experience.  The staff was very friendly, and the service was professional.  Obviously if the joint was jumping, like on a Friday or Saturday night, it takes a little longer for food to arrive, but that's how it is at any busy restaurant.     Do yourself a favor, next time you have a taste for Italian food, and you're near Summerlin, check out this place.  They have indoor, and covered outdoor seating.  It's a great location to \"people watch\" while you are enjoying a drink and a great meal.",

Great decor, ambiance and location! (next to movie theater and close to parking) Food is a bit pricey for what it is but I don't mind it being a special night out.",

We were completely blown away by the atmosphere and the excellent service we received. Our servers name was Heather*** (I'm sorry heather!) and she was terrific. We also got a chance to meet the restaurant Manager, Mimmo. He is one of the main reasons we will be returning to this restaurant, besides the tasty food, of course! Mimmo is from Rome, Italy and he makes you feel like part of the family.   The atmosphere is outstanding. I absolutely love the layout of this cute little restaurant. The kitchen is open so you could see everything which is a really great touch.   They bring free garlic knots to the table, which they are so soft and accented with Parmesan and Romano cheese. We decided to start off with some calamari as our appetizer. It was the best calamari I have ever had! It was so tender and perfect. So, compliments to the chef.   For our entrees we ordered baked ravioli and baked ziti and those were excellent as well! I am completely impressed by this cute little restaurant and I will keep returning to enjoy their great food!",

He is treated so bad by the server Ricki and it's sad to see someone work so hard for someone so rude.   We had a party of nine and from the beginning server Ricki was helping the hostess seat us. They were both annoyed and we just seemed to be an \"inconvenience\" to them. After we sat down Ricki was our server, and she asked what we wanted to drink. She offered alcohol we said no alcohol. She stated that she didn't ask if we wanted it. Okay well whatever than. After she bossed her busser to get drinks she took our order and we asked for bread please. She stated \"once your food order goes in than you will get bread, you will have to wait\". The whole time she was treating her busser like he was a slave.   She got our pizza wrong. The food was okay. Nothing to rave about.   We couldn't get her attention for anything she was to busy hanging out at the hostess stand talking and chatting. On the way out I told a manager about the experience and Ricki had the nerve to come chase us down in the walkway to the stores in downtown summerlin to tell us she didn't have an attitude and we were wrong. Talk about uncomfortable and so awful! Horrible customer service. We won't be returning! :(",

    "text": "The original Trattoria Reggiano location inside the Venetian is pretty popular, and has had a 4 star average for as long as I can remember. So, when we first arrived to this new second location, it wasn't too shocking to hear we'd have a little bit of wait (30-45 minutes) even on a Sunday at 7pm. But it wasn't until nearly an hour and fifteen minutes later that we walked in and got seated on the patio of what might be the smallest restaurant in Downtown Summerlin.   Up until we got seated, there had only been one other party that put there name down to wait. In the time that we waited the place really started to clear out, and shortly after we got seated, there was only a handful of tables sat. The place was pretty much dead. But for whatever reason, a table of about 6 people had the whole staffs attention. They had been there the whole time we waited for a table, and were there during our whole meal. Obviously either very close friends, or family of someone associated with the restaurant. Food was coming out to them in waves, and nearly every staff member was waiting on them hand and foot. It took 20 minutes just for our waiter to come over after being sat, and throughout the meal, it didn't improve. Drinks and food took forever to come out, we had to ask for refills multiple times, and the guy seemed to barely know the menu. To put it lightly, the service sucked. Even if every waiter here was new, this restaurant has enough experience that they shouldn't have untrained staff, or even crappy service in general.   When it comes to the menu, it looks like it's pretty much exactly the same as the original location. They have a variety of classic Italian dishes, some pizza, seafood, etc. Pricing doesn't seem to be any different, and is about average for this style of Italian restaurant.   We were brought out an order of complimentary garlic knots. The flavor was actually pretty good and they had good texture, but holy friggin' grease. These things felt like they were made and then just rolled in oil. They also brought a little pepper, olive and cheese tray. It was okay, but I'm glad I didn't pay for either. Not really an impressive start.  I had pretty much already made up my mind on what I was going to order before we even came here. The filet meatballs sound good, and usually get great reviews. So, I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. The noodles were cooked well, obviously not hand made or anything, but decent. What really let me down was the meatball. I'd say mentioning filet mignon in the title is just a way to sucker you into ordering them. If there is filet mignon in them, the amount is so little it's impossible to taste. They really just taste like straight up pork meatballs with no seasoning. At $14 for an appetizer order of meatballs, and $18 for the spaghetti and meatballs, there should be no doubt that filet mignon is in them. Their supposed house made pomodoro sauce is alright, but this is far from an $18 plate.  At this point, I was done and not even thinking about trying their dessert. But most of my table wanted dessert, and oddly enough, it was the best thing about this place. Sort of. They have a \"homemade\" chocolate cake that looks just like the garbage Claim Jumper serves, so I passed on trying that. Their tiramisu was excellent though, and really was the saving grace of the night. I'd literally come back just for that, and would likely try the ricotta cheesecake too.  Maybe I expected too much...but with a pretty dang successful restaurant, in the Venetian of all places, I thought TR would have a lot more to offer. Long waits, horrible service, and below average food just wasn't what I had hoped for.",

Thirty minutes have now passed and our beers and drinks are empty but no food is present. Finally flag our server down and she looks at us and tells us yeah yeah it's coming it's on the way and she didn't even refill our drinks! Later, she comes back with a notepad and asks each of us what we ordered and began to write it down! 45 minutes in and she hadn't even given our order to the kitchen. Our server was replaced and they gave us a free antipasti platter that we didn't even want - we just wanted our food at this point. No one touched the platter at all. Our food finally came and we were approached by the manager offering us one cannoli or one slice of cheesecake for the four of us to split. One dessert for four people after sitting there for an hour waiting for our food! When the bill came, there were no apologies and no comping on any of our meals, and the food here isn't cheap at all. Hilga has been our server two times in the past and after the third time, we won't be coming back until she is gone.",

Warm, lightly salted and moist. So delicious we asked for more! Perfect to dip in the wonderful balsamic vinegar and olive oil.   We started with the arugula salad. The dressing is light and tasty. We ordered the large size and they split it for us. We really appreciate that type of service. We also ordered the ziti pasta with meatballs. The meatballs are made with filet and pork. The dish comes with 2 huge delicious meatballs. The pasta is covered in a creamy and cheesy sauce. The dish is huge and we all took some home. I recommend you split this dish..as it's very filling.

We happened upon this place by luck - we were at Red Rock looking for a place to eat, but their fire alarm system went off and it was loud and chaotic. We couldn't wait to get out of there. Looking on Yelp, this place had great reviews and star average so we took a chance. Seeing that it was in a shopping center, we kind of did not expect a lot but what a very pleasant surprise!  We were kindly greeted and seen to a table within a few minutes. It was a little unusual to be seated side by side but it ended up working perfectly and allowed us to share plates easily and gave us a level of intimacy that is hard to achieve when sitting across a table. We were sat 45 minutes before their closing time, but there was not a hint of being rushed. They had wonderful live music on a Saturday night and we could tell there were a lot of regulars who come here just for the music.   The food! Exceptional garlic bread knots and our lovely server gave us an extra basket of them. The meatballs in the Spaghetti and meatballs were tender and delicious. My penne pasta with vodka sauce and prosciutto was perfectly sauced and al dente. The Caprese salad included heirloom tomatoes, basil leaves and the most delicate, soft fresh mozzarella.   It was not just about the delicious food and the live music, but also our wonderful Italian server who checked on us repeatedly throughout the meal and also came and chatted with us at the end. He truly made the night special.",

I said I don't want to do Neapolitan pizza I want bananas pizza well you can't eat it here meanwhile my partner and I ordered an appetizer and a cocktail she ordered a salad I told him pack everything up when around the corner eight bananas pizza meanwhile it's the same owner.

So we decided to come back for a date night. I am glad we did! Not only is the atmosphere very romantic but the food is excellent as well. We have both been to Rome and felt like this place really captures the charm of authentic Italian restaurants. There was even live music!  As you sit down and order your drinks, they bring out amazing garlic bread and balsamic vinegar/olive oil. The bread was warm and fresh! We started our meal with the fried calamari, which was excellent! Our pasta entries were wonderful too, with rich sauces!  Attention to detail appeared to be a priority at Trattoria Reggiano, which I think is a rarity in this day and age. I absolutely recommend this place and would come again!",

We ordered a small Caesar salad, the eggplant starter, the meatball starter, and the tomato basil caprese salad.  The eggplant was my favorite and absolutely delicious, the meatballs were ok, but i felt like they lacked flavor. The caprese salad was delicious and the Caesar salad was a little too anchovy flavored, I'm more of a light anchovy flavor with more of a citrus bite to it. But to each their own.  Over all this was a great place for lunch and i would go back! :)",

Hilda was our server and she was a pleasure to order from!  I have ordered the white wine linguine in the past and the penne al a vodka this time around. I will say I preferred the linguine and I can't wait to order it again in the future. Granted, both dishes were DELICIOUS. The one draw back is I love angel hair pasta and it is not an option on the menu nor as a pasta substitute.  I also ordered the Morning Spritz cocktail which is an Italian staple. Trattoria always prepares it just right, with it being the perfect bitter to sweet ratio... not to mention how refreshing it is! The best summer cocktail in my opinion, so good that I wish it came in a bigger glass!   For desert I ordered the carrot cake which had beautiful layers of cream cheese frosting. It was a lovely end to my meal and I saved half of it for later!!",

At the end of the meal, he asked if we wanted  boxes for our leftovers, to which we agreed, then left, came back a second time and asked us again. The cherry on the cake was when a skinny, blonde hostess (who sounded also a little scattered)  inquired if I was someone's mother (who happens to be only 9 years younger than I.

I  then had Spaghetti Aglio E Olio and surprisingly (I felt) was a very small portion but it was very flavorful. I had a side of meatballs  which consisted of 2 nice size meatballs. Everyone has their own preference of how a meatball should be made/taste  and to me these were perfect! My husband had chicken parmigiana with spaghetti and the chicken was huge.  He said it was good. Our server was Ricki and she was great. Though quite expensive.....$70.00 for lunch! (no dessert, no drinks except for one soda) we enjoyed the food and service.",

I think the tortellini was homemade. Not sure if it was made right there, but either way tasted very homestyle! Yes, that is a good thing!  My friend had an Arugula Salad - It was SO SO SO good! (better than my caesar) and spaghetti carbonara. Delish as well.  For desert we had a piece of chocolate cake that was as big as my head! There you go, judging again! LOL....It was GOOD!!! And no, we did not even eat 1/2 of it! Although I wanted to!   Great place, and it can get busy because Downtown Summerlin is catching on as the new spot to go play and eat! If you are thinking a weekend night, I suggest making reservations",

There's a lot of options for Italian in downtown Summerlin, but I was curious to try this place out after walking past it so many times- I'm glad I did. I tried the Chicken Parmesan and pepperoni pizza, so delicious! Their marinara had excellent flavor and they immediately give you garlic knots upon sitting down, (mouthwatering) but be careful not to get full before your food comes! Portions are on the larger side and the restaurant is nice but not elegant, perfect for just a casual date night or dinner with family. Also, friendly staff! I was one of the last tables and didn't feel rushed at all.",

The kale peanut salad is so amazing. The large portion is plenty for sharing. Also, the server recommened i add shrimp to the pesto gnocchi and it paired perfectly. Everyone at the table tried it and agreed it was a great choice. The pesto sauce is very good and the portion size is large. The garlic knots are to die for. The espresso drinks are made on a fine imported italian machine. Pairs perfectly with a cannoli or chocolate cake. There was great live music and the performer even sang happy brithday to our mother. The atmosphere is very inviting and everything on the menu is delicious! What more can yoh ask for?  This place is always packed for dinner when I've been. I hope they open a bigger location at some point to accomodate more patrons because the food is so darn good!",

We decided to split a Caesar salad, I've never seen one with tomatoes and I'm guessing the dressing was bottled.  the bread for the table was good though.  Hubs had shrimp scampi, oddest we've ever seen.  Instead of shrimp stir fried in butter and garlic, it was shrimp that had been butterflied and topped with bread crumbs and placed around the rim of a dish of pasta.  I had lobster ravioli.  What they didn't say is that it's not cold water lobster, had been frozen and was chewy and no flavor.  the sauce was so overpowering that any flavor the ravioli had was lost.  I thought it might have been my imagination but the guests seated next to us got the same thing and we all had the same impression.  We realized when we were seated that we'd been there before and hadn't loved it but thought we'd give it another try - there won't be a next time.  Amazing that most gave it four stars.  Maybe I'm just pic  Mea Culpa - I posted this is the wrong spot, should have been the one on the strip.  I apologize to the owners.  Apparently when you post to Yelp, it's there forever.",

I do not appreciate your tone and have a feeling no gift will be coming my way. Don't say that to make yourself look good. If you had the intention, why not leave your contact information? How am I supposed to message you without your email address? My thoughts exactly.   I love there food here and come here often, but not sure if I will after what I just heard. My dad placed an order to go for my birthday and I asked him to get two dozen rolls. Now, keep in mind, these rolls are free and come unlimited when you dine in. I absolutely love these rolls and since there will be six of us eating, to ask for two dozen is not a big deal. My dad was told he can get a dozen for free but would have to charge him $12 for the second dozen. That's absolutely ridiculous to charge $1 per roll, especially for an item that should be free.",

Trattoria Reggiano is a quaint local joint that offers an assorted selection of Italian favorites and classic dishes like spaghetti and ravioli with a flair of modern touches.     Overall, the service was top notch and the food solid and tasty.  Only slight critique would be the veggies and potatoes had a bit too much virgin olive oil on them and the shrimp scampi and a bit too much garlic as well.    Enjoy the pics and would recommend a nite out with your couple friends (leave the kiddos at home) to enjoy some good food with wine and relaxing atmosphere since they also sometimes have a live performer as well in the evenings.",

Parking is plentiful and free.  They do take reservations, but we have never seen the place packed.  It's modestly sized with a bar area and patio seating as well.    We had the pleasure of being served by the bartender Bethany as the first time we came our table we adjacent to the bar, and she was so good that we asked for her specifically the other two times we came.  Attentive, friendly, and just overall excellent!  They provide complimentary garlic knots and a small plate of cheese and assorted olives.  We tried the limoncello cocktail which was excellent.  Well-crafted and strong but with a pleasant sweetness.  We also tried the Caesar salad which was excellent and quite traditional.  It does come with anchovies, but of course these can be omitted as well.  We have tried a few dishes over the three visits including spaghetti and meatballs, chicken francese, spaghetti carbonara, and the pasta Bolognese.  All were absolutely excellent.  The pasta is always perfectly al dente, and the sauces taste complex and rich.  The meatballs are hearty and taste like something right out of an Italian grandmother's kitchen.  You just cannot go wrong with their entrees.  We also tried two desserts.  The tiramisu is a \"deconstructed\" tiramisu served in a glass with lady finger cookies.  Interesting presentation but very good.  The chocolate cake was the only weak point in all the meals we've had hear.  Very basic and plain and unworthy of the rest of their excellent menu.  If you are in the mood for some very good Italian food with great service, then you must try Trattoria Reggiano (and ask for Bethany!).",

They had live entertainment there, it was a guy singing and he had a pretty good voice actually. The only thing I don't suggest he do is go up to people and start singing to them while they're eating lol. It's awkward and uncomfortable, other than that a fairly nice little dinner bonus. This place is located in Beautiful downtown Summerlin.   Food: Excellent!!! They first served us with a complimentary olive and cheese plate as well as garlic knots. We had their delicious eggplant rollatini (to die for) as a starter and then our main courses. Very tasty and served quickly.   Ambiance: Somewhat romantic if you want it to be. Medium to low level lighting in specific spots. We didn't need to make reservations when we went but then again it was a Tuesday night.   Service: Amazing waitress! Very attentive, bubbly and polite.   Dress: Business casual, or casual.",

    "text": "Summerlin location experience.  I never write reviews but this was an exceptional experience for me and I wanted to share with you.   Pizza box states: \"No Secrets, No Gimmicks, Simply The Finest Pizza Created With Quality, Passion and Time Honored Traditions\"   This is a big joke ..... you are not going to find anything like that in this item.  Maybe the tradition is to screw you over..... not sure but that is how I felt after paying $20 for it.  Ordered margarita pizza. First try:  It was horrible. Burned outside perimeter crust. Raw center field area. Poorly assembled that was very unappealing in appearance. Burned bottom surface. Burned taste. Very little basil, 1/4 of a leaf of basil per section and very little of everything else that makes a good pizza. Rate on scale 1-10. I rate 2. I am sure you could find a worse pizza, but it would take some time to find it.  Phone call complaining to manager. Offered replacement to me.  Second try:  just as poorly done as the first try. This time even less basil leaf. Very few small pieces of cheese. Overall very poor quality especially for the price. Missing everything that makes a good pizza except for the box. The box is made of good quality cardboard.  DO NOT BUY THIS PIZZA. WASTE of your money.  If you don't believe me then go ahead and screw yourselves and buy one. Palace Station movie theater has a fantastic margarita pizza. Very yummy and about half the price.",

    "text": "Short story: as a kid we'd go to this place in my hometown called Joann's Italian Food with the slogan \"Good food from Nina and bad attitude from Ernie\"  Let me tell you, this was a promise that they always delivered.  We became accustomed to this type of Italian food sort of hole in the wall with a functioning juke box and C9 type vintage Christmas lights in the ceiling that were there all year round.  Ernie was a very dry surly older man with white beard and he loved to give us all a 'hard' time whether it was refills or needing a box.  It was his shtick and he 'shtuck' to it.  The food was amazing however.  The marinara was to die for as it was so tangy and just tantalized your taste buds and the cheese pizza was so good you'd eat the next day straight out of the fridge even if the cheese was ice cold.  Anyway, all this to say that since Joann's closed, we've been looking for something similar or at least reminiscent.  I really believed that Tratorria Reggiano delivered.  I felt like the marinara was tangy and the bolognese sauce was one of the best I've ever had even compared to trying bolognese sauces in France and Switzerland.  Everything was great!  They give you what Bethany calls 'goodies' which is their small charcuterie with peppers and olives, prosciutto/parmesan.  Garlic knot bread is great and she says it is unlimited.  Caesar salad is quite authentic and served with a sliver of anchovy.  If you go, definitely ask for Bethany, she is really sweet and kind and provides great service.  The only thing that was less amazing was the desserts.  They seemed like pretty standard Italian type desserts with a twist.  I guess because the food-food was so great, I had a higher expectation.  We have never had to wait for a table here.  The seating is all chairs and tables I didn't see a booth.  But if you go, find the hovering Vespa scooter in the ceiling (thinking its a Vespa).  We almost went to the Olive Garden nearby but after being seated next to a rowdy family where menus were thrown at my head, I felt we needed to take a chance and try something else and I'm glad we did.  It is our current absolute favorite Italian restaurant here in Vegas.",

    "text": "I was meeting a girlfriend for dinner here - first visit for me - and the big bonus was the discovery that we couldn't have picked a better night: on Wednesdays ladies drink for free from 6-8! Too bad I'm such a cheap date, but my one free glass of wine was nice.  We didn't have a reservation, so at first the hostess said that there would be a 45-minute wait for a table. But then said she could probably seat us before that. No lie - I was seated before my friend even arrived. The bad part was that the table was right near the bar, and a loud drunkard was using the seat part of the chairs as his personal footrest. The staff knew him to be an obnoxious idiot, and bent over backwards to move the table - twice - and side with me when I chastised the jerk.   The great service extended to the waiter, who was super. He had a name tag, but I wish I could remember what it said. He told us that his name was Irish. He had every quality that makes for a great waiter, including patience as we dallied over the menu.   After downing the fabulous garlic knots and the pepper, olive, and parmesan nibbles, we decided to share the Eggplant and Ricotta individual pizza and the Italian Kale Salad.  The individual pizza is a misnomer - it's only individual if you're a burly trucker! For us two petite ladies, half of that, plus the substantial salad, left us totally stuffed. The pizza toppings were really good, but for this ex-New Yorker, the crust could have been crisper. And a little more fresh basil would have been welcomed.  Not being a great lover of kale, I was unsure of what to expect, but it turned out to be an exceptional salad. I don't eat pancetta, so we got that, the gorgonzola cheese, and the dressing on the side. My friend gleefully had my share of the pancetta, too. But after trying the kale in combo with all the other great flavors, I think my admiration for kale has increased geometrically.  Everything is a learning experience, so here's what I learned: Yes, ladies, you can drink free on Wednesdays, but it's the most raucous night. While there's live entertainment every night (I think), it's much harder to sit across from someone and actually talk on hump night. If you want to drink and dance, this Bud's for you. As for the prices, they're a bit higher than many other restaurants, especially for main entrees, but on Mondays the pizza and pasta are half-price. But the terrific hostess (whose name I've also forgotten) and the primo service make Trattoria Reggiano a new favorite, and I look forward to going back.",

    "text": "After spending a few weeks in Europe and Italy this summer, my boyfriend and I have been on an Italian kick for quite some time. I saw the reviews of this place on Yelp and decided to give it a go on Uber Eats-- only one small problem... the food was absolutely horrible.  Here's the breakdown of what we ordered and thoughts.  Lasagna: Arguably the worst lasagna we've ever eaten... ever. This lasagna is definitely not Italian. The ground filet mignon was just awful, making the lasagna very chewy and gummy and the store-bought bleached flour, thick, non-homemade lasagna noodles only contributed to this. There was a lot of grease from the fatty filet and even a hunk of gristle in the lasagna to top it off. I'm bewildered that they actually serve this and would be embarrassed if I were the chef or restauranteur. This is NOT Italian.  Lobster Ravioli: (yeah, we tried* to kick down for the good stuff). This was horrible. While writing this review I just keep shrugging my shoulders-- I just don't understand. Thick, chewy, bleached flour raviolis with puree'd seafood (that is absolutely tasteless) in a medium thick, super sweet pink sauce (Why so sweet?? Do the chefs not taste their food?) with large chunks of over-cooked chewy lobster. After about a teaspoon of salt and some fresh ground pepper this was edible. Edible... not good, but edible.   Caprese salad: This wasn't horrible, but it was a big meh. $15 got us (literally) 3 thinly sliced pieces of tomato with a very large ball of burrata (Seriously? Three slices of tomato for a huge ball of burrata? C'mon for God's sake). The caprese salad was served Italian style (legit the only thing actually Italian style) with olive oil.  Long story short, we will not be ordering from here again. I want to feel sorry for writing this review, but at a spendy cost of $86 (including delivery fees and taxes) for take out from an Italian restaurant I really just feel sorry for myself. If you're looking for good authentic Italian food-- keep looking.",

I liked the oil and vinegar for dipping with the garlic knots as well. We shared a Caesar Salad to start that was good and came with the traditional anchovies on top.   My Eggplant Parmesan Sandwich was good. This eggplant had the perfect thickness for a sub with a nice tasting marina. Crusty bread and mozzarella topped it off. My husband enjoyed his Sausage Pizza.   Overall, a decent meal, but not overly memorable. I'll keep this spot in mind for the patio dining though.",

Jason was very familiar with the menu and checked on our satisfaction during dinner. He also encouraged to relax and linger after dinner to enjoy the live music which started at 6 PM   We started with complementary dinner rolls that were warm and savory. Go easy or you will fill up before the main event. Next the Baked Clams appetizer (8 clams) which were delicious but a few were over toasted. A lemon squeeze was the perfect topping.  Chicken Marsala was juicy with an abundance of mushrooms along with a tasty sauce. Chicken Francese breast was tender and had the right balance of lemon and butter. Both entrees was large portions with plenty to take home. The selection of desserts that were brought to the table looked decadent but we had to pass with no room left to enjoy.",

We were just trying to grab a quick bite before our movie at 7:45pm next door.   Our server Zekke was awful. The second we said we didn't want to order any drinks he lost all interest. I know that's where restaurants make money but it's not like we were taking a table away from other guests with a higher check. There was probably only 4 tables the entire time we were there. It took 35 minutes to just get a salad and another 20 for the pizza. When the pizza finally came out our server tried to give us tiny bread plates to eat off of. When I asked for a normal sized plate, he rolled his eyes and walked away. I honestly couldn't believe how rude he was!   We left and mentioned to the hostess how horrible the service was but honestly I don't think anyone in that place cared. We won't be back.",

They were happy to give me a bottle of balsamic vinegar and olive oil but not Tabasco. As a Louisianan, I find that insulting and inexcusable. Tabasco must be spread with the original nozzle, not a [add profanity] cup. There's more traditional in that bottle than anything else in that restaurant. Fix or I shall not be a frequent guest.",

Open kitchen and bunch of open doors leading inside from the patio seating.  Minno was our server and he was super italian and very friendly. I mean like super Mario level italian. Like thats a spicy meat a ball level italian.   My mother and I had the Calamari, caesar salad, and the Margerita with proscuitto pizza (cant remember exact name).  The complimentary garlic bread was delicious with the olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  The calamari was honestly the best I think Ive ever had. Definitely using really fresh squid. Batter was light and crispy and most importantly the meat was still perfectly cooked and tender and the Marinara dipping sauce was amazing. I literally cleaned the whole plate.  Caesar salad was really good too, they are using high quality ingredients here and it makes a world of difference. Beware of the anchovy garnish though because it was intensely salty, do not eat in one bite like I did.  The pizza was honestly the most unimpressive part, I dont know if it was because I was so damn full already which definitely affects how tasty something is, but I just wasnt blown away. Still not bad by any means. Granted I did eat two garlic knots, half a caesar salad, and 75% of the calamari before even tasting the pizza though..  I want to try the pasta dishes next time because they look amazing, and this place is definitely on the more authentic side so Im sure they taste legit too.  If youre at this mall, eat here.",

    "text": "Been here before and had a good experience with one of the friendly bartenders. I guess that was our only lucky day here. Things went downhill fast this visit. This time was completely awful. It ruined my daughters birthday dinner! Very disappointed in how they OVER CHARGE for dietary restrictions or substitutions. Since when does it make sense to sub out prosciutto for broccoli florets for $5 charge? Well it was $5, and There were maybe 6 broccoli florets in the entire dish. Felt like I was being nickled and dimed. Had I known that they were importing the broccoli from Mars or blessed in holy water, I could've went to Trader Joe's across the way and brought my own to save money. Anyways, We ordered the gluten free version of penne ala vodka. This item comes with prosciutto. The server informed me I would not even be receiving anything close to the menu item that was already priced at $30. No vodka no prosciutto no pink sauce. So what was it that we were receiving? Still have no idea to this day. The server had such an attitude problem about everything from the start, we should've known it wasn't going to be a pleasant experience. We also put an order in for a Cesar salad as a starter no croutons. I asked if we could add onions to the salad. Insert eye roll from server here. She finished taking our order and walked away. Our salad arrived with our pasta, 30 mins later! The server made sure to bob and weave away from us as to not answer any of our questions. She did not want to come up with an explanation as to why it took 30 mins for a starter salad to arrive! The really nice busser was kind of enough to refill our waters and provide my 5 year old daughter with bread. My husband and I had our food come out before my daughters basic spaghetti with marina! Everyone knows you serve the kids food first before the adults, especially when it's simple pasta with marina already cooked in the back. Alas, our server was unaware of such hospitality. We flagged her down asking where our daughters food was, she said oh lemme check and never came back. The friendly busser came to the rescue with my daughters food. We finished our meal and asked for the check. We were shocked to see a $6 charge for gluten free pasta and a $5 charge for broccoli. We asked the server why so expensive if it's technically not penne ala vodka and substitute broccoli. She said that was policy. Wooooow. We then noticed a charge for $3. We asked what was this about? She said it was for the onions in the salad?!?!?! So you're telling me it was $4 to put 6 onion slices in a small cedar? Was it farmed to table in that very instance? In what universe is this acceptable? I've managed some high end restaurants and been bar manager at others, none of these \"standards\" would've been acceptable. Broccoli is nowhere near the price of prosciutto. Why would you charge someone for vodka sauce if they're not getting vodka sauce? She might as well charged me for a steak and said well it's the same thing. To round off the crap night, I had to ask the server 3 times if she could sing happy birthday to my daughter. She brought a cannoli with no candle or anything. She was too busy to even acknowledge my kid or smile at the very least. She set the plate before her and did not even try to light the candle. She just walked off! Two tables down it was someone else's birthday and what do you know? They had a wonderful server who got the whole restaurant to sing a joyous happy birthday to them and with a smile! Must've been a nice feeling. Explain to me why she's in the hospitality business again? Thanks for a horrible memory on a special day. Do not waste your time or money at this place unless you're a masochist and love flushing money down the drain. Go to the other Italian places in downtown summerlin or wolf gang puck. They always treat you with respect and never charge you extra.",

    "text": "No wait on a Sunday afternoon.  Expect to wait if you go on Friday or Saturday night (I tried once before and was told 1 hour wait .... no thanks).  Great selection of Italian dishes.  I had the lobster ravioli and wife had the linguini and claims.  Both were very good.   The flavors were very authentic. Lots of claims.  Also had the espresso martini that was well prepared (not too strong on the alcohol and a good espresso flavor)  Another big thing with this restaurant are the complementary garlic knots.  They are great.  They have olive oil and vinegar on the table, but some butter might also be nice.  Also, when we got our first batch, they were very cold and I mentioned this to the waitress who said \"Ohh, they just came out.  So do you want a new one?\"  Yeah, right -- they just came out (15 minutes ago).  Nice try.  The correct response is -- \"I'm sorry, I'll get you a fresh batch right away.\"  But they were replaced with a hot fresh batch about 3 minutes later.  In fact, if I had any complaint, I would say that our server was not the most attentive (took a while to bring drinks, took a while to bring the bread, the aforementioned breach comment).  The other complaint was the prices -- almost $70 for lunch for two with no dessert and one martini drink (including tip).  A bit pricey, but this is appears to be the new norm in the bourgeois downtown Summerlin area, so I guess its to be expected.    The dessert tray looked good (and I would like to try the TIramisu) but I was full so will have to be next time.  Anyway, I will definitely go back and try out some other things.",

    "text": "We have been here three times and all three times I have been very disappointed.  The service is great but the seafood dishes have been very disappointing!  The first time I ordered linguini and clams. at least six clams didn't open and the sauce was bland and flavorless and the clams had a very fishy taste and smell.  They did give me additional clams but half of them had broken shells that led me to believe they took the ones that didn't open and just broke the shells to get the clams out. I didn't eat them because if a clam shell doesn't open on its own it is because the clam is already dead and who knows how long it has been dead.  Second time there I had the shrimp scampi. The shrimp were not over cooked but they were stuffed!?  The breading they were stuffed with were soaking in oil.  There was no delightful garlic/wine sauce it was just butter and stuffing.  So I removed the stuffing and ate the six or seven shrimp.  The third time I ordered the shrimp and linguini in their red sauce.  The shrimp tasted very fishy again and the red sauce was utterly bland! It was extremely disappointing.    My husband had their veal parmesan and said it was good except that the veal wasn't pounded down and the thickness was a little off-putting and a too thick breading covered the veal.  He also had, on another visit, their carbonara and he liked it a lot and on our third visit he had the baked ziti and thought it was very good but the meatballs were  horrible.  Our friend had the lobster ravioli in a pink sauce.  The pink sauce had a very mild flavor and he said it was okay.  The garlic knot bread is good and the service is good.  The manager or owners ask you how everything is and we always say it's good but I just don't like to make negative remarks in front of their customers so this review is more for them and I just pray the read it.    We love everything about the restaurant but the seafood dishes need a major overhaul and they need to remake their meatball recipe.",

Really on top of things. However... The prices they charge for their food is a little ridiculous. I got the chicken parm and while it was good it was just your regular chicken parm, not worth the $26. The salmon my mom got was dry and flavorless. The pesto gnocchi my sister got was super bland. The pizza my brother got was good but didn't really have much to it in terms of flavor. The entire meal was definitely over priced. They had an Italian band playing too. And his voice was nice, but it was really too loud. We can barely talk to each other without screaming. It kinda threw it all off. Maybe it would be a better ambience for a one on one date? But not for a family. We won't be back, unfortunately.",

The shrimp scampi was so salty I drank a gallon of water over a two hour period. The shrimp was hard, rubbery, and chewy. Dropped a $100 bill on that miserable experience. BEWARE !!!",

Coming to Tratorria Regiano reminded me a bit of what I come to expect when revisiting Italy. Good food and excellent service are both on display here. Our waiter was knowledgeable about the menu and specials, which was very nice indeed, but I was more focused on the native Italian busboy who cleared the table and supplied the Reggiano to my party's salads and pasts dished. The man couldn't have been much younger than 70 years old and he was totally committed to making sure our table was always well-attended to. I forgot the man's name but I want him to know that I give the restaurant the extra star for his exceptional service. I had the ravioli and it was made al dente just as it would have been made back home, in Roma. The salad was huge and my friend's plates were delectable looking as well. Buona fortuna, Tratorria Reggiano e ci vediamo subito!",

    "text": "VISUAL AESTHETIC: 3/5 Trattoria Reggiano is located within Downtown Summerlin, right beside the Regal Cinemas. The sign is properly displayed and easy to find, while the parking lot is also convenient and just steps away from the restaurant itself.   This can be positive or negative, depending on the party dining, but the restaurant is coddled between the theatre and an adjacent restaurant while across the way is a set of buildings. Although this is the layout of the shopping center, the wall creates a short of \"block\" in the space for the outdoor patio seating.   The seating arrangement outdoors and indoors is quite small, and the bar has a wall that slices through it which divides the visible advantage of space. Tables are covered with a paper and have a cup of Crayons which offers a \"family friendly\" aspect for those that have children.   Overall, the atmosphere is average. The dining decor is comfortable, and the level of noise is also average.  FOOD: 1/5 It was my first time dining here. The reviews drew my mom and I to this restaurant and we decided to celebrate my birthday here. We wanted to take our time ordering as we expected to eat and drink for a prolonged period.   We ordered two martinis, which were fine, and we also picked two starters, the mussels and calamari. Just a clarification, the serving sizes were HUGE; our server DID NOT mention anything at all when we were ordering so we ended up full with the two appetizers alone.  We were given garlic knots and a plate of antipasto which contained cheese, olives, and cooked peppers. This was perhaps the best part of the meal because the mussels were not fresh. They were soggy and the meat lacked any texture other than \"mush\". The calamari was alright, but room temperature when we received it -- Which was 40 minutes after we ordered. The sauces for both of the dishes were nothing special, though we ordered the \"spicy\" sauce for the calamari which had no spice whatsoever and looked like it  came out of a can.  SERVICE: 1/5 The service here was awful, which is an understatement. Upon arrival, the hostess was extremely slow and chatty with the party before us. I understand customer service and catering to patrons, but there were people in line behind us. You cannot take fifteen minutes to seat one party and hang out to talk to them at their table when others are also waiting. This was unprofessional.  After we were finally seated, we didn't get to have a waitress until we had read over the entire food, drink, and wine menu several times. When she finally did show up, she made it obvious that she did not want to spend time at our table because we watched as she catered to every table around ours from getting drinks, refilling bread, to serving the actual entrees.   And this is picky of me, but every time I have ever been ID'd on my birthday, I am typically told \"Happy Birthday\"? I believe this is a typical service at most restaurants, but I suppose she didn't bother to actually look at my ID when she had asked for it, glancing and handing it back to me immediately.  We had stated that this was our first time at Trattoria Reggiano's and our server made no effort to tell us about the serving size of their portions. But had the audacity to come back later to ask if we wanted entrees. When we declined, she proceeded to say that she didn't think we would since she \"wanted us to see the amount of food for ourselves\". I was completely appalled at that sort of answer.  OVERALL EXPERIENCE: 1/5 I have dined at other restaurants within Downtown Summerlin and this has to be one of the worst experiences I have had. The food was mediocre, the service was less than sub par, and this place really doesn't deserve the raving reviews that are going around online. I am completely disappointed and will not be returning to such an unprofessional restaurant.",

They have fans and air conditioning I believe ( I felt cold air coming no out of the vents) Any-who. We brought our dog with us and was also surprised that they are dog friendly although the hostess/waitress didn't offer water for her. My SO ordered the pizza margarita and I the meatball sub with fries. The pizza was okay could've been cooked longer at the bottom and the crust was a bit chewy for our liking as well but the rest was like I said okay. The meatball sub however was on point . Crusty bread, tender meatballs in a well seasoned sauce, delicious melty cheese and the crispest fries I've had in a long time. The waitress was very nice. I highly recommend.",

The linguine and sauce were so good. The sauce was light so it did not feel heavy like an Alfredo sauce. The shrimp was not cooked that well and that's the only reason I did not give it 5 stars. It was super crowded but the service was still great. Never had an empty drink which is a big plus. My daughter had spaghetti and she could not e happier.",

This place was close and had some good reviews. We are so glad that we decided to eat here!!  Our server was fantastic. The receipt said \"Dominico\" but I forgot to look at his name tag. Anyway, he was an older gentleman with an accent. He made great recommendations and steered us exactly where we wanted to go. We ended up ordering the Italian Kale salad to start and let me tell you....it was amazing! Then we got the Lobster Ravioli for our main course and it was fantastic as well. We were both very impressed. There was also live music and it was perfect.  We only make it to Vegas about 2 times/year and I can't wait to come back to enjoy another meal here. Next time we will make sure to save room for a cannoli!",

She even brought a small cannoli to my husband for dessert.  Food was great! You start with a little appetizer dish of peppers, olives and parm cheese chunks along with the best garlic knots ever. Could have stopped there. So good! And Hilda brought MORE!! Swordfish Siciliana was delicious - tender, juicy approx 8oz piece was plenty to share with capers, olives and tomatoes. We shared it along with the eggplant pizza which had a crispy thin crust and sliced eggplant and riccota. Lovely. Kid had what looked to be house made tortellini. Can't tell you much more than they disappeared quickly.   Wonderful experience in Vegas, away from the drama of the strip.",

I ordered a cheeseless pizza and she asked if there's was an allergy they needed to know about, which I thought was awesome that she asked. My friend ordered a pasta dish that looked and smelled amazing, but my pizza was awful. Usually when you order something with capers, they're just kinda sprinkled on, but this was like an entire jar of capers had been dumped on the pizza. That was the only thing you tasted. The crust had no flavor, the mushrooms had no flavor, the sauce was barely visible.  The crust was hard and flat, it was like a cracker. I couldn't cut it with a knife, and it was difficult to pick up to eat. But both the pizza and the pasta dish were huge portions and everyone was super friendly so I would recommend this place, just not the pizza.",

    "text": "First the positives: The cannolis are very good, and are similar to what you would find in New York Italian Pastry shops. Unlike many cannolis that are served in Vegas (in which the cream filling tastes like flavored whipped cream), Reggiano makes a decent authentic cannoli cream filling, made with ricotta cheese (which makes the filling thicker and tastier). The Pasta e Fagioli Soup is also very good. The service was fast and friendly, and the atmosphere/decor was casually pleasant. Now for the negatives: I ordered the baked ziti with meatballs. The meatballs were decent size, and made with high quality meat, however they were very bland (I did not taste any garlic, onion, or any other ingredients usually found in meatballs....I don't think they even added salt). The baked ziti was OK, but again, a little bland, because it was just pasta and cheese (they should have added meat, like ground beef and/or ground sausage, that is typical for this dish). Also, they serve their baked ziti in a Pomodoro sauce (baked ziti should really be prepared in a meat sauce to give it more flavor). Overall, this place is OK, but there are so many other great restaurants to choose from in Vegas, that I would not go back to Reggiano for dinner. However, I would definitely go back for just some cannolis.",

They have a Happy hour too which is nice and the outdoor seating is really comfortable a real plus is you can hear yourself talk. Unlike some of the other restaurants in DT it's a great place to connect and meet with friends, we loved it! Service by Paolo was superb, I know I said it again but it's worth repeating. Great calamari, Chicken Parm is one of the dishes they're known for. We had such fun and loved it. See Vito the manager and ask for Paolo you won't be disappointed...",

You can choose between eating Outdoors on the patio or inside. Both good options. The service was excellent. The complimentary garlic knots  that they serve  at the beginning of the meal  a truly outstanding . Unfortunately the rest of the food did not rise to that level. For my entree I chose the chicken marsala. It comes with a side of pasta. The chicken was chewy and the flavor blah. My wife went with the meatball baked ziti. Also very mediocre. My buddy order the lasagna. He had difficulty eating it and rated it as poor at best. I gave it three stars rather than less because of the garlic knots and the outstanding service period but I certainly would not return here when there were so many other options for good quality Italian food in the area.",

However, this portion was definitely not small at all. It just seemed like they served dinner portion food in a small plate. We ordered couple beers, and they were served in a cold icy glass, which we loved for a sunny Sunday afternoon. Also, we ordered their carbonara pasta with shrimp and Vongole. The linguine was cooked perfect, and so was the spaghetti. I love their shrimp for some reason, since they cook it so tender.   Our server-I believe his name was Anthony- was friendly, attentive and caring. We found a random piece of thick thread in our vongole, but didn't really care. It was not a hair or anything. We killed the dish, and at the end of the meal, we told the server that the food was amazing-however, we still went ahead and told them about the little piece that we found so they could prevent it from happening to other customers-since some people do rage about nothing.  The manager came over to our table and apologized. I do not think it was their fault, since things like this can happen. He comped the pasta dish for us, which made us feel horrible. However, we left the amount as tip, and left very satisfied.  TIP! The Andes Mint Chocolates they give at the end of your meal are perfect dessert!  Love every aspect of this restaurant. I specially like this location better than venetian one. Definitely give it a try!",

The location is great (next to movie theatre) and I can see why it would be a goto spot in Downtown Summerlin. The patio seating with live lounge music is a nice place to hang out during the weekend...make sure to place reservations. The singer will politely ask for your favorite songs but then play her own lol...it's her thing :) A bottle of wine and great service from Sam and Daniel, the manager, plus the Garlic knots make this place worth revisiting. The food is lackluster and overpriced but TR's crowd doesn't seem to mind.  Chicken Marsala, Veal Piccata  - Both very pedestrian. I think these dishes cater to the older crowd that doesn't like bold flavors but enjoys shuffle board. It reminded me of something I might get at a buffet.   Overall, I wouldn't recommend TR to anyone that wants good Italian food or knows how to cook. But if you want ambiance and don't mind making a meal out of the Garlic knots, then this is your place!",

Unfortunately, the food was crap. The pictures of the bread looked soooo good on other reviews - I had such high hopes! But, alas, the bread was rock hard and nigh flavorless (more pretzel like). The pasta, I kid you not, tasted EXACTLY like Chef Boyardee ravioli. We will not be going back. Macaroni Grill beats this place by miles.",

Two stars off for that grossness. We intended to leave a $15 tip on a $53 bill, but took back $5 once we saw our food get manhandled.

Maybe it is because Trattoria is in downtown summerlin but $18 for a salad seems excessive to me. We ordered the Kale salad, a margherita pizza and a cannoli. The garlic knots served before hand were amazing! I could have eaten a whole basket of those and left content. They were warm, fresh and smeared with butter and garlic. Carb heaven.   Our server was great and split the salad for us so we each had a good portioned amount and the pizza came out perfectly with a chewy crust and a little char on it from the brick oven. They use authentic Italian tomato sauce here and the flavors and unmatched. The cannoli was authentic and perfectly sweet and a nice finish to the meal.    I forsee enjoying the patio here when it isn't oven temperatures outside and I would like to come back to try a happy hour here as well. I appreciated how well our server took care of us.",

The flyer said \"Ladies Night\" and attached to it was quite a number of cocktails, wine and beer. The selection was amazing so I figured why not check it out from 6:00-8:00pm. There was a live singer and another guy on keys. The vibe was very jazzy and the food smelled incredible when you walk in the door. I was there early enough to grab a high top round table  and hold a few spaces for friends that were joining me. The waitress comes to your table to bring you any of the selected items on the open bar list and we did t have to go to the bar and lose our place. The music did not drown out your conversation either as I had close to 20 ladies that ended up joining me that evening. I will be back for sure and I had an amazing time! The small bites during Happy Hour are calling my name the next time around.",

Although it was warm outside, we sat in the outer dinning area and felt fine. The fans kept us really cool and we were shielded from the sun. Every table gets free bread and a plate of olives, cheese and other little vegetables. I ordered the pesto gnocchi which was just okay. I'm allergic to dairy so it is often hard to find a good meal without cheese in it at Italian restaurants. I think next time I will try the spaghetti and meatballs.   The prices are definitely high, so it's more of a place to celebrate a special occasion. Our waitress was super nice and patient with us. I would definitely go back for a date night",

Service was okay in the beginning, after we ordered a pizza and my daughter ordered a salad as well. We had no plates... for those, we had a few pieces of pizzas she was full, I was fairly full still had pizza on the table, my cell phone and had not seen the waiter in a bit. She had to go to the bathroom. The bathrooms are multi gender so at 10 I stand outside, don't care where  we are. Go back to the table, food gone,phone gone, all is gone. I look at whomever I can  catch eye contact with...the server and manager at the same time.  Manager says we thought you left... really? Phone on table, etc. Okay fine, how am I gone if I don't have a check and leave my phone?  She said we thought you left sir, I ask...how? Offers to remake the pizza as we were taking it home with us but why? For me it's about getting it together. Like hire another waiter. The excuse was you should have told your waiter, if I would have seen him I would have. Either do away with dual gender bathrooms or hire more staff. Like there are no single dads out there. #payattention",

    "text": "We went to this joint recently and I'm on the fence. I've heard nothing but great things from the one on the strip. This one is much closer to home.   Service: Our waiter was Jason. The poor guy seemed so stressed and the entire restaurant seemed understaffed. First downside. Jason was great though. Even though he seemed rushed, he was very attentive and quick to make sure our drinks were filled and our food came out in a very timely manner.  His manager or whomever the older gentleman was at the window for food was not. He kept yelling out at the waiters. Which I felt was insanely unprofessional because that window is right next to tables. This is a very open restaurant and you can see all of the cooking staff.  There was a time that Jason was taking our order and the manager yelled out \"Jason! Order up!\" And Jason kind of glanced over at him to show him that he was in the middle of taking our order.  Who does this? I don't know. But I hope he sees this and realizes that it makes him look horrible and the restaurant in general.  Also, hire more people or staff appropriately. We went during prime time, 7:30ish. You should be fully staffed. Otherwise, you have a bunch of waiters running around trying to serve a ridiculous amount of tables and people are going to start to get frustrated.   Food: I wasn't really that impressed. The calamari was good, but a bit too peppery. The marinara was very good and very flavorful. We also had the lobster ravioli and the lasagna.  Ravioli...it was good. It was probably my favorite dish. But the lasagna kind of lacked in flavor. It was very mediocre and pretty plain. Which in my experiences in Las Vegas, it's all roughly the same for lasagna for some odd reason.   The restaurant itself isn't very large. They have a nice sized patio if you want to dine outside and they do have a nice selection of wines. The best was they have a nice description of what the wine is, so that is very helpful. We had the Barbera D'Asti. I highly recommend if you like red full bodied wines.  The prices we reasonable as well.   Overall, I'm sure I'll go back to try other dishes. It's a nice location and another good addition to the Summerlin Downton Mall.",

The coffee were like hot water, no coffee taste at all. The spaghetti with meatball is nothing to get excited.  The only thing good about this is allowing my dog to sat with us.",

Food was large portions, well prepared but I was most surprised by the attentive service. I've eaten at every restaurant in downtown Summerlin and this one just jumped to one of our favorites. Much better than Grape Street both in terms of food quality and definitely in terms of service. Keep it up!",

The kitchen overlooks the dinning area so you can see your food being cooked right in front of you! Very cozy intimate spot, great for a date night and great food! Staff was excellent and took care of all our needs. I had the chicken parm, it was very tasty, chicken was juicy and not fried tasting. Red sauce is very Southern Italian, pizzas are big and flavorful. This will be a weekly spot to eat at! Finally real Italian food in Summerlin! Looking forward to trying other dishes!!! Yum!",

In my three times being back at this establishment since my less than exceptional first experience, I have found that the service, food, and ambiance has improved tremendously. This location has gone from one that I nearly disdained, to one that I recommend to colleagues without hesitation. The unprecedented turnaround that this fantastic restaurant underwent is nothing short of astounding, and I look forward to enjoying the impressive Trattoria Reggiano for a long time.   (P.S.) My Reccomendations:  1st Course: Calamari 2nd Course: Chicken Francese or Veal Milanese  3rd Course: Tiramasu",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I decided to try this place last night,July 26 for our anniversary since we live close by and both love Italian food. We went in at around 8:45 and were seated immediately and were told that they close at 10- which is fine.   Our night quickly turned when we met our waitress. She was extremely rude and was reluctant to answer any of our questions. When I asked \"what is the difference between a small Caesar salad and a large?\" She rolled her eyes and said a small is a small and a large is a large.\"As if we didn't already know that. So then I asked another question, \"is a small salad enough for two people to share?\" To which she replied, \"it depends on your appetite.\" ABSOLUTELY NO HELP AT ALL. So we ordered the small Caesar to share and the portion was so small my boyfriend just told me to have it. After this our waitress didn't check in at our table one time. She walked past and would say \"is everything ok?\" But wouldn't even stop walking to hear our answers.  This type of behavior would be somewhat understandable if they were busy but we were one of only three tables in the restaurant!   I could go on and on about how rude our waitress was but I think that about sums it up. I will say this however, at the end of our meal when we asked for boxes, she boxed up my boyfriends food and I boxed up my own, which I didn't mind. My boyfriend took his left over baked ziti with meatballs to work with him today and guess what? The waitress didn't put the meatballs in the to go container.  After paying the high prices of the entrees and wanting to take some home one would assume you would get everything you paid for in the to go container but apparently not.    We went here to celebrate what should have been a great night, but our service was so poor, half way through the meal both of us were upset.   I am in the food industry as a waitress and I usually don't write yelp reviews like this but this was the WORST dining experience I have ever had in my life.   I did give two stars however because the food was good, and the hostess and busser staff were very friendly. But our experience was so sour we will never be back.",

    "text": "The second star is for the garlic knots. We ordered a pizza. I've lived in NYC, I've had great pizza. Been wanting to try this place for a while. I'm not exaggerating: the pizza came to the table cold and soaking and flimsy as a wet noodle. Literally like a cold, wet noodle. The \"crust\" was so incredibly thin and floppy and wet and cold that I started to take a photo for this review BUT before I could do that, a woman collapsed in the restaurant and hit her head and wasn't getting up. Please understand this next part and read carefully: I was sitting at the far end of the restaurant and there was a ridiculous amount of servers working in this place. Like two servers to a customer. At least 15. The bartender, servers, hostess, and manager just stood there like stunned sheep, so I was the first person to call 911. After running across the restaurant by myself, they obviously had no kind of training in place for an emergency situation. People acted like I was a hero for merely possessing common sense. After the ambulance showed up and took the woman away, the general manager commended me and comped our entire bill. I explained the pizza issue to him and he acted like he knew about it and was embarrassed, but here's the kicker: the guy was from New York....and he allows his kitchen to serve sloppy cold pizza!? But hey, the free garlic knots were incredible!",

    "text": "To start let me say we found our new local favorite!  We recently found this little gem after seeing a movie at Downtown Summerlin.  We plan on visiting for dinner prior to our future date night at the movies.  The restaurant is literally right next door to the theater.  Service is top notch!  We started with a drink at the bar so we would have a chance to look at the menu.  The bartender was very gracious and answered our questions about their specialty drinks and wines.  After looking at the menu we decided to have dinner and were promptly seated.  Our waiter was right there to greet us and answered our menu questions.  He also asked if we were seeing a movie so he could time our dinner if necessary.  I ordered my fave, eggplant parm which was awesome.  Perfectly cooked and not loaded with cheese.  My better half had a kale salad which was actually very good.  I rarely order healthy dishes but may rethink this as the salad had a great dressing and was a nice change from the standard caesar.  The manager Vito stopped by twice to check in on us and offered us a complimentary plate of olives and cheese which was a nice touch which you rarely see these days.  My only complaint is the lack of restrooms.  They only have one unisex restroom which is located in a busy hallway so it was bit awkward with a couple of us waiting in line.  I have already recommended it to friends so I would give it try.  You will not be disappointed.",

I could go back every night just for the garlic knots. I've never had the pizza here but can tell you the pasta meals and appetizers (chicken parm and marsala and the fried calamari) are amazing! Not a large wine selection unless you buy by the bottle which is a bummer for me, but still worth the trip! WOULD LOVEEEE gift cards available for here... especially with the holidays coming up. Also would LOVE a to go menu. With gift cards and to go menus, this place would be that much more amazing. Gift cards please!! :)",

Ill either get a pizza or the veal chop parm on the bone. All the food is good but they have zero attention to detail and they are so slooooooooooooow. Last time was the worst. This time things started off well, appetizer came out quickly, food came fast too. Then it's just crickets. Sit sit sit sit.. I decided to walk around to find our waiter. No where to be found. I ask the hostess if she can locate him. She came back and said the guy is in the bathroom. I get it, guy has to go, but use ur head and ask someone to look after your tables if u r gonna be 20 mins. Finally, we got the check, i left 10 bux on 70 and a note telling them how slow they are. Im not going back anymore. It good food but not worth guarantees awful service.",

    "text": "I'd give 3.5 if available, but I'm feeling generous so I'll round up.    4 of us went for a Saturday night dinner.  We had reservations for 7:30 and they seated us immediately.  Restaurant was clean, staff was about as friendly as you could reasonably expect with a packed house on a hot Vegas night.   Here are a few, admittedly minor, critiques. - our waiter was an older gentleman, with a thick, we thought possibly added on and emphasized for 'authenticity' accent.  He clearly struggled with the whole placing the order via iPad thing, especially when one in the party ordered something he wasn't familiar with (but was on the menu and no changes were requested).  - The pasta e fagioli was certainly nothing to remember, which is disappointing with the 'we're in DTS so we can overcharge' pricepoint on all the dishes. - and one of my pet peeves, they didn't bring all the entrees out at the same time.  They brought three and one in the party had to wait for a while until theirs arrived.    Not sure if I'll go back.  Food was solid (save the soup), but the price was rather high for what you get and there are better Italian options in town.",

This location is a little off the strip in an open air complex, which was nice change. The aesthetics of the restaurant was very nice, the service personable and the food excellent! We came a little after the lunch rush and were seated immediately inside (although the open air seating would have suited us fine as well). The Garlic bread served with oil was very good. My meal consisted of the ravioli and my dining partner had a salad. Both were excellent. Well prepared and filling. Even after being stuffed from the bread and entree's, we split a canoli...which was amazing! We will definitely be stopping by the next time we are in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "My family decided to eat out this Sunday. We yelped Italian restaurants and saw the four stars so decided to give it a try. The restaurant was clean and the staff were attentive.  The restaurant was not busy(maybe a third full). The food had little to be desired.  The food was no better than the popular Italian chain--they even use the same boxed pasta! We started with calamari which were rubbery and greasy and served with an odd colored \"red\" sauce that was actually orange. I had tortellini with Alfredo sauce which was melted butter mixed with cream and very watery. No herbs or flavor whatsoever.  The tortellini was not house made and over cooked to boot! They were happy to take my tortellini and remake something else but after eating a stick of watery butter from my first bite, I lost my appetite.  My husband ordered veal parmigiana but the waiter brought some odd fried meat with a salad on the top!  Oops. My son ordered chicken parmigiana.  He said it was ok. We were out for a family meal and my son ended up eating alone while my husband and I watched.  Right about the time my son finished eating his meal my husbands actual order came so we got to watch him eat.  Not exactly the family dinner we had in mind.  Very pricey for \"chain\" quality food.  I would not recommend this restaurant.",

    "text": "The concept seemed lovely with an indoor/outdoor feel, but the food will not make a repeat visitor out of me. The garlic knots and an antipasto plate were very nice, however the salads we ordered were entree sized rather than starters-would have preferred half the size at half the price. The Kale salad with peanut dressing was difficult to eat as it was very spicy and very heavily dressed. The Margareta pizza my husband ordered which comes with no cheese (lactose intolerant) was COVERED in capers which were not mentioned anywhere. That is a very specific ingredient that serves mention on the menu. He is not a fan so rolled most off and ate half. I ordered salmon and vegetables-the preparation was fine although a lot of oil appeared on the plate mixed with the lemon sauce-not a fan of that much oil. The vegetables were heirloom squash and zucchini-really cute vegetables! Overall just very hefty priced and neither of us was impressed with our items. Perhaps the pasta is the way to go as there is a very authentic vibe-but we'll pass on by next time in Downtown Summerlin.",
